1342457274.0,wnfmr,Boyfriend and I had our first date with another woman--**UPDATE**   NSFW,soupface2,76,11,23,"You guys wanted to know how it went...

Ho. Lee. Shit.

It went well.  So well.  Better than I could ever have imagined.  It began with an amazing date, and we told her how we were also super nervous, and then we discussed whether or not anyone had done this before.  Turns out she was a first-timer too which was really nice to hear, and she seemed relieved that we were on the same page.  It made everyone feel more comfortable and it was nice just to be able to discuss something that we were all thinking about and curious about.  We had a laugh and a toast.

The entire date was particularly great for me because of how nervous I was that I would get jealous, so pretty, so fun, I want to kiss her and talk to her or hear her laugh.  The best part is, every now and then I'd catch my man's eye and know he was feeling all these good feelings too, and I felt so close to him.  I felt safe and loved.
 
Okay, after a minute or two of everyone kissing everyone, she stopped to ask us what our boundaries were and what was okay with us.  I already liked this girl so much but it was extra awesome that she was so respectful.  I told her everything was good and we moved to the bedroom.  

And stayed there for hours.  It was amazing.  She was beautiful and great in bed

I was worried a threesome would be physically awkward but our chemistry was insane.  I can't even write about it without getting butterflies in my stomach.  I loved being with her, and seeing another woman experience him, seeing her face and hearing her voice when he was fucking her...yeah. Wow.  Just, yeah.  The two of them worked together with hands and mouths to make me come, then she came while kissing me and him fucking her, then he came onto her back while kissing me. 

The next morning when we woke up

On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it one billion.

I was chatting with an open-minded but more traditional friend about my open relationship - she asked, something in my head had finally clicked the pieces together in terms of understanding non-mono, jealousy, and compersion.

Nonmonogamy doesn't make me feel inadequate - my partner's needs have no relation to my worth as a person. The joy he finds with others does not diminish the joy he continues to find with me. In fact

It isn't right or fair to expect one person to be the paradigm of romantic relationships and fulfill all your most important social and sexual needs. There's an instability inherent in this philosophy - lots of scary ""what if?"" moments, freewheeling hedonistic happiness, and overwhelming gratitude for this person who holds so much of my heart, but lightly and gently, instead of squeezing it tight to himself. Which means my heart has room to grow.

Our big adventure in love began when I had a friend give him a note from me after class one day (in the usual high school fashion.) Since then, we're in an open relationship

When I came back from school for winter break this year, but to my delight, he was relieved that I had brought it up. 

Now, all of the awkward sex stories that I tell my girlfriends, and he's very comfortable with my sexuality. I tell him about the guys I think are sexy, he shares his sexual fantasies with me.. there's very little to no jealousy in our relationship, and we pretty much never fight (although we've never really fought anyway.) Essentially, our relationship is awesome, and none of the sexual encounters I've had since we started back up have threatened it. 

I have friends who say 'I don't think you're going to have a normal relationship after this.' 

Excuse me? What's normal? Secrecy? Fighting? Jealousy? What's so great about it? Normal is a social construct. Monogamy is only considered normal because we've been hearing it over and over. My relationship with my boyfriend may not be normal

1374717112.0,1izzb9,Just sent my girl off to spend the night with another guy - really excited for her...,sexplus-anon,56,9,28,"Ecstatic to have a sex-positive story to share!

I've been in a relationship with my girl (let's call her B.) for three years, but we like some variety, adventure, and the occasional validation from others.

We've talked about being casually open throughout our relationship. However, we haven't been able to make it work. Several things got in the way: our shared focus on a particular *type* of openness (no poly/emotional relationships and no pickups, only FWBs); social constraints due to heavy work schedules; communication issues; and some really unfortunate timing during a few opportunities.

With all of those complications, or whether we were only OK with openness *in theory*...

Last weekend

For several years, and we often host visitors). We agreed, and since B. had to work most of last weekend, C. and I made friendly plans to hang out. B. and I knew that C. is pretty sexually open - one of our group sessions was with C. and her guy at the time - so it seemed possible, but we had no expectations.

As soon as C. arrived, and C. and I spent most of the night making out on the couch. We took it really slow - clothing didn't even start coming off until after an hour of heavy making-out - but it was intense. C. and I spent most of Saturday and a little while on Sunday in full-on hookup mode (while still managing to keep our evening social plans with B. and others).

B. and I sent C. back home on Monday. That evening, almost ritualistically - very powerful experience), and had sex. It wasn't intense or prolonged (truth be told, I was a little spent), but it was the emotional reconnection and closure that we both really needed.

Throughout the weekend

I was deeply moved and grateful for her openness - and I really wanted to return the favor. ""Some day

But by sheer luck, the timing is perfect.

""Would you be OK with me seeing him tonight?""

""YES! Have fun! Be safe!""

We share a car, filled it up with gas, and came home to turn it over to her.

""I have no idea what to expect tonight. Things might work out

""Whatever happens is fine, let's say, 10am tomorrow.""

I sent B. out the door 30 minutes ago

Some observations:

1) Timing. Motherfucking TIMING. Like normal relationships

2) My hookup with C. kind of flipped a switch in my mind about the context.

While both B. and I want occasional sex with others as a supplement to our relationship, and I trust her completely - it's just a product of lingering social anxiety that I've been working on my entire life.

Sex with C. put it in perspective. My emotions and mental calculus finally hit home:

*This isn't a big deal.*

To be clear, and I'm hoping that we can meet up again - but basically, it was just some friendly, fun screwing with a friend. It didn't change my relationship with B. *at all*. Sex with C. finally gave me a mental framework for totally accepting and supporting B.'s own sexual adventures.

B. has been saying that all along

3) Sex with C. not only satisfied my cravings - it also strengthened my relationship with B. First, the variety of sex with C. reminded me and made me appreciate what I've loved about sex with B. (not as a competition, but simply as recognition of the contrast).

4) Maybe the most important thing that reinforces the OK-ness of this all is: developing a relationship safety net. Throwing a little more time into my relationship with B.

So that's my story. Hope it's helped some of you and entertained others. I'll be eager to read your feedback,False,self,t5_2rc24,1374721183.0,,,t3_1izzb9

1371150294.0,1gabdo,Field Report: My [F]irst Extracurricular Activities after 10 Years of Monogamy,first-in-pornography,44,9,7,"**Story time. Be warned

We go through phases of highs and lows like many couples— from warm and affectionate to efficient and businesslike, almost perfectly all of the time. 

We have always felt philosophically drawn to non-monogamy. We got together quite young— we were only twenty when we met. I had dated around quite a bit before I found him. But he, and had enjoyed the rush of it: meeting new people, flirting, working them up, getting them to want you, pushing their buttons, exploring them

Then last month a person dropped into my lap. Someone kinky and private looking for a no-strings. He pushed all my buttons, he cared about being safe. I wanted to go for it. 

So I brought it up with my partner. I didn't take a single step without telling him. I showed him the message chain on OKC. After the conversation transferred to text message (with my partner's go-ahead), and sexual risks. I told him how I felt— that this new person was exciting and I wanted to go for it, but I had zero doubt in my mind that no matter how much fun it was, I would always be looking forward to coming home to him. My partner.

I told him that no matter how crazy it got in the bedroom, I would be honest. He thought about it and said okay. That he was still worried, but he trusted me. That he was getting a little turned on thinking about me coming home to him freshly fucked. About me telling him all the details of how I got manhandled by a stranger. Fucking me afterwards himself, in our own bed. Reclaiming. 

I set up the meeting for the next day. My partner had some conditions he wanted me to meet beforehand. First, I would be allowed to pull my underwear back on and leave for my date.

It all went according to plan.

I got to the meeting place first. I was standing around looking for a table. I still hadn't seen a photo of his face yet and had no idea what to expect. A pair of hands grabbed me hard from behind, firm body.

""Hello,"" he said. Handsome. Mellow. Nice. 

We talked. Expressed mutual approval of our first impressions. Some getting-to-know-you, would be the best possible outcome of this relationship. His answer lined up nicely with mine. Safe, trustworthy, no strings attached, violent, painful, absolutely filthy sex. 

I laid down some limits: no choking. No breath restriction of any kind. He laid down his: no blood, since I'd been monogamous for 10 years. He whistled. ""Jesus fucking Christ."" He said he got tested a few times a year, but that he was a bit more blasé about it than he probably should be. I said I'd feel more comfortable if we both had a fresh screener and paperwork to prove it before I performed anything other than manual stimulation— I had managed to get a small cut in my bottom lip and couldn't risk giving him a proper blowjob until it healed. He said that was quite reasonable. He was stroking my knee under the table. Grabbing my thigh. We went back to his place. I texted my partner the address. 

When we got inside he popped open the collar of my dress and reached inside. Grabbed my breasts and squeezed hard. Pulled my dress off, slapped my ass, shoved me onto the bed. Pressed his hand into the wetness between my legs and rubbed and pushed inside. His finger felt unbelievably long and thick, he had huge hands— he curled his finger up, pushing hard against the good spot, and then added another, stretching me tight. I must have made a sharp noise because he said ""Oh, mocking voice. 

He fucked me hard with his fingers. I pressed my face into the comforter, long slow strokes, dipping inside, pushing. I think I wailed at that point. He laughed and grabbed my ass with his hands and licked my asshole once, hard, and then his tongue pressed in. I gasped and arched upright and he reached out and pushed me right back down again.

Side note: holy fuck I have never been rimmed before. I did not know what I was missing.

After his tongue withdrew from my ass it was replaced by a finger. A long

I was there for an hour, and it was all very new and a bit too fast and I think I was still a little nervous. It felt like a trailer for a movie, cutting quickly from scene to scene to scene. I left pleased, but pent-up. Antsy. Wanting more. Next time. 

When I got home I sat down at my partner's feet in our bedroom and rested my head on his knee. I told him everything that had happened. What my stranger had been like, or acting worried about his ego. He admitted he was glad, in a selfish sort of way, that it hadn't been a mind-blowingly amazing experience— but that he was also glad it had been good, and interesting, and different. I smiled and said I understood. 

I told him I hadn't managed to orgasm. He raised his eyebrows. Said ""We should probably do something about that."" I laughed as he pushed me onto the bed. He yanked off my underwear, slowly, to the hilt. It felt good to come home.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1gabdo/field_report_my_first_extracurricular_activities/
1360603936.0,18bh1c,Happy Monday Story of our 1st swinging experience,SwingerN00b,40,9,2,"Been lurking for a long time and finally wanted to create an account because I have a great success story to share.

My wife and I are celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary today. We’ve always been very much in love with each other

A couple of years ago, but she had not slept with another man since we’ve been together.

That all changed this weekend. A few months ago, and decided we’d have an adventure with them. We planned to hit a local strip club after dinner and invited this other couple along to join us.

There was a great chemistry between my wife and the husband of the other couple. While his wife and I were hitting it off as well. At the strip club, and flirted a lot. After spending about an hour there, focused more on each other than watching the entertainment, we decided to move the party to our house.

Everything happened so naturally. Before I knew it, touching, laughing, tasting. It was a really great time! We were quite intimate, but also very playful. After a couple of hours, she got a text from her husband in another part of our house that things were winding down.

We got dressed and I drove them home

After only a few hours of sleep, after all this time, to be with another man, but she really enjoyed herself. They had sex a few times, as did I the night before, but it clearly wasn’t enough for us. We were very revved up all day. We got out of bed near noon to have something to eat, then went right back for a quick nap and some more fun in the mid-afternoon.

The rest of Sunday was spent talking about our experiences

After this experience, after getting a taste of something different. I couldn’t be more pleased about how things went.

**TL;DR – My wife and I each got to bang someone else after our anniversary dinner and it made for a great day of sex and love between the two of us.**

1375197953.0,1jcplf,Sent my girl off for a night with another guy - terrifically positive experience! (update),sexplus-anon,36,9,7,"An update to the [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1izzb9/just_sent_my_girl_off_to_spend_the_night_with/)...

As my girl, I was riding an emotional high - this was exciting, and I really enjoyed supporting her adventures. But I wasn't sure how my emotions would respond.

I made one request of her: Please be back by 10am. (We had a 1pm obligation that required our mutual attendance

She agreed

My evening apart from B. started out fine - ordered some pizza, what if, what if...? Of course, it was all nonsense - my relationship with B. had been rock-solid, and our sex life was consistently great - and I knew better than to give them any credence, but the buzzing in the back of my mind was becoming a nuisance.

Two things helped.

First, I don't depend solely on her for my needs. The weekend with C. was fulfilling for many reasons: developing a closer relationship with a friend; the basic pleasure of physical contact; a reminder that I am desired and desirable; the feeling of personal growth into a new area; and of course, some great, fun sex. In addition to simply enjoying the memories, it reminded me of what the weekend had been about - and that that's the experience that B. was having with D. that evening.

Second, because I really wanted to talk to her and I knew she'd be up late. Our discussion neither avoided nor focused on B.'s evening with D.; we just talked about everything - life, work, hobbies, the past weekend, future plans to see each other. Feeling the strength of a social connection further steadied my nerves, and when my thoughts returned to B. after our call, again

Our bed felt huge and empty that evening, when B. texted me:

*I'm coming home.*

A sense of calm and happiness washed over me

Bless her heart

I joined her, and we love *talking* about sex, so this was just a sharing of experiences. That these experiences were brand-new, and had arisen during our relationship, felt... completely irrelevant, actually.

(Sadly, D. admitted that he's having a bit of difficulty with the situation: he would really like to *date* B., but that's not what she wants, and he wants to be careful with his emotions. Props to him for recognizing the difficulty; B. is giving him space to work through it.)

Going forward: B. and I are talking a lot about how where things might go. Our circumstances with C. and D. are different, B. and D.'s relationship is more casual - closer to a booty-call relationship - but D. may be moving to our town for work, so it could be more common. Because of the differences, B. and I are talking constantly about these relationships to ensure that we're still on the same page, and still OK with each others' actions.

I'm sensitive to all of the ways that we could fuck up this arrangement: neglecting each others' needs and our relationship; letting our other relationships become serious; a relative imbalance in our side activities; etc. Seems like good communication can mitigate those problems.

**tl;dnr**: Everything that I'd *hoped* would happen from the first post has come to pass. B. and I each had a great experience that satisfied some deep-seated needs and desires; our relationship feels stronger and more interesting; and we have some new friends and fun thoughts of future adventures.

It gets easier over time 'sharing' my husband - I want the focus to be all on her when she is with us because I get him to myself all the time. I can reconnect with him in bed with more sex, reconnecting when she (as a general term not just for awesome-girl) leaves is huge.

This weekend, hit on a man we had been fantasizing about for months. I went to his tiny hotel room (that he had for a completely nonsexual reason). We hung out on the bed for a few hours, laying there, occasionally touching. I wasn't sure if he wanted sex or not, and at first he wasn't sure if I was. Through conversation and the occasional touches, I ended up with his arm around me. He started rubbing my back, and I made some little noises to let him know I was pleased. From there, I laid in his bed

Saw him the next day

Talked to my husband about it. First he got off. Then he started acting upset. We're having pretty decent conversation, but not so much fun that I want to do it again if my husband is sad about it but doesn't want to admit that he's sad about it.

* Been dating for 2 years

* Decided we'd like to be non-monogamous and occasionally sleep with other people.
* We've tried online

So I guess my question is

* Do you tell them you have a gf/wife? 
* Are the women you hook up with/date non-monogamous as well
* Do your friends know that you and your partner are non-monogamous? 

I ask this because me and my boyfriend go out to the bars a lot with the same friends. So, there really is just one bar district that all the college students to go to in my town. So even if he went out all by himself (which is sort of awkward to just go by yourself), he's going to run into people we know. So I don't know if we should tell them, or maybe we should just tell them we're looking for a girl to have a threesome with so it's fine if he's hitting on other people and how do you tell your friends something like this? I don't know. :/

The gist of my problem is this: I'm in an open relationship with an amazing woman. I'm all for being open in theory

We've been dating for about half a year now and we have a solid foundation. We communicate well, we have a sound, strong relationship.

We decided to be open when we started dating. She had experience with a failed open relationship before (failed on her ex-boyfriend's part), and had come to the conclusion that I also wanted to try an open relationship.

Theoretically, because why the hell not? I don't feel any right to tell my girlfriend what she can or can't do with her sexuality, partially because I wouldn't want to be subjected to similar restraints by her. And I've even already had sex with someone else while in the relationship, and she was totally fine with it.

But when she tells me she's going to make out with and eventually have sex with a close friend of hers... I get incredibly uncomfortable. When she goes off to explore some rope play with a friend who's into it, though my brain is shouting, ""Awesome! Have fun! Be you!"", my heart is distinctly unsettled. I've spent the last few days in an odd, slightly ill-feeling space.

I *so desperately want* to just be okay with this all. I want us to have a relationship where we can validate and enjoy each other's sexuality, and I want to be able to recognize and appreciate that. And theoretically, my brain is behind this 100%. But not all of me is cooperating, and it's becoming an issue for me.

This *is* something we talked about. Like I've said, not when I *want* to be okay with this, and not when I've already taken advantage of the openness of our relationship. My current plan is to just let her do what she wants to do, and go however far she wants (within our preestablished rules, of course), in the hopes that I'll realize in the aftermath that I don't have anything to worry about.

Does anyone with experience have any advice for overcoming this and getting my heart and my gut to get in line with my brain? I really don't want to just blame this on the openness of the relationship

Even just some encouraging words would be appreciated. I've been unstably waffling between a Zen acceptance and absolute freak-out on this issue for the last few days

1345100675.0,yb596,Is Non-Monogamous sex always rough sex?,NikKnack,29,7,53,"I've been in an open relationship for more than 6 years now and though we've never been with tons of people we have been with a few. One oddity I have noticed along the way is that whenever I've been with a woman experienced in the ways of non-mono she has certain expectations... And those expectations are that I'm going to bang the bejesus out of her.

I'm not really about crazy rough sex, but the impression I get from the women I've been with is that all the other poly or swinger men basically just bend them over and fuck them doggy, that the sex they get from others is usually just as rough and hard as possible.

My wife has actually reported something similar from the guys she's been with.

There also seems to be a strong tendency to connect BDSM with the poly lifestyle. Sometimes it seems like unless you're into whipping people you're on the outside looking in.

What's the deal? Am I just imagining all of this? Why must these two things go hand in hand?

**EDIT 1** It's interesting to me that every single comment below seems to agree that this is definitely a thing

**EDIT 2** So since almost every comment seems to agree that yes, bang as hard as you can sex or BDSM... what should the handful of us who really aren't in to that supposed to do?  And what does that fact that this is the case say about the poly and non-monogamous communities?  Any chance that this is turning off people who might otherwise by non-monogamous because out in the mainstream most people are not really into BDSM and are never going to be because it doesn't do anything for them (personally I find it boring and tedious... if you're into it that's fine but it does nothing for me).",,False,self,t5_2rc24,1345152602.0,,

Long cheating saga starts here

In September

I started getting incredibly anxious about the whole situation. He told me that my anxiety was completely unfounded and almost scolded me for not trusting him. ""I take care of you first. If you're upset, and he was angry both times that I was even asking. I decided I was being overbearing and that I had no reason not to trust him, so I let it go. I let it go even after she sent a puff-painted envelope to the apartment that we both live in and only I pay for. It had a little loving note inside and a present for him. It was post-marked from before he said they'd stopped talking, though, so I just trusted him that it was over. 

When he was back in our home state, but neither of them cared. She thought she was in love with him and wrote all about the whole thing in a blog. He started sleeping with her two months after telling me he cut contact- he'd been talking to her the entire time. He slept with her regularly for a month while I was in a different state. He slept with her the final time the night before he left to drive home to me. And he'd been talking to me the entire time this was going on without ever hinting at what he was doing. He only told me because I just had a *feeling* that something was off and I asked him directly if he had seen her. He told me about it like it had been a one time thing. I found out three days after he'd come home that it had actually been on-going for a month. I was furious that he didn't tell me the whole story to begin with. 

Now that I've told you the whole nasty story, because I'm clearly fine with him being with other women or it wouldn't have worked for the last year. So, he's basically telling me I'm being too dramatic and claims I'm punishing him. After two weeks of thought, I told him I want him out. He says I'm ""tearing down the relationship"" and that no one reacting like this could really love him. Other couples weaker than us have gotten through infidelity, so we apparently weren't that strong to begin with. Etc. Alarm bells are going off in my head that this is manipulation, but I'm still worried that I'm being too cold or too harsh, and maybe I'm freaking out over ""cheating

I know what the responses would be from anyone in a monogamous relationship on this one

Sanity check

**TL;DR** - Boyfriend in open relationship slept with woman repeatedly after telling me that he'd cut contact. I'm leaving him and he's furious about me ""overreacting."" Please give me a sanity check. 

EDIT: After finding out that I still wanted him to leave, ""I hate you. I'm not being nasty, I'm just trying not to display how much I hate you. I want no connection with you, so I feel no need to respond when you ask me questions."" I ignored this and asked if he'd found any places, and he reminded me that I'd said he had two weeks. I didn't realize when I'd given him the date last night that he would be making the apartment unlivable; I have a job that I need to function in every day. I said if he's going to act nasty to me every day then he needs to leave sooner rather than later. ""Oh, so you're just going to go back on the decision that you made now?"" He was getting progressively more aggressive, so I just said, ""Fuck you!"" and added ""go fuck yourself"" for good measure. 

I don't deserve to be treated like this by someone in my own apartment, I think I might end up having to just put his stuff in our foyer and change the locks. He's getting really aggressive.

The main reason for the first poly thing was my wife's attraction to the woman and her interest in seeing me with her.  I was never motivated to have sex outside my marriage.  I didn't have qualms about it, I certainly didn't need to try anything again.

Then we met the wife of the new couple.  She's amazing.  I sort of have a non-standard type

The husband is a good guy.  My wife likes him, he's a little jumpy.  But so am I.  OUr rules so far have been 'no piv with the other wife' and thats not been a problem.

He's out of town for a week or two at a time for work.  He doesn't want us seeing his wife while he's gone.  But he does want to text my wife. Last night, but I agreed.

So it turns back to me.  Why

I haven't had to cross any hard lines in myself here yet.  Everyone is willing to respect them if I make a point of it.  But I'm walking a fine line of being true to myself and getting with a beautiful wife of another guy.

EDIT UPDATE:

First I want to thank all of you who responded.  It gave me plenty to think about and to look for.  Things have progressed pretty nicely.  The other husband had a bit of a change of heart.  He has accepted

More than that, and also likes the outcome.

I think it helps that I have been scrupulously careful with his boundaries as he makes them clear to me.

It also helps that we hauled everybody out to near where he was working so we could meet up at a hotel this weekend.

It's always been my hope that we could try it and get it out of his system and never have to do it again. While I'm not completely opposed to it

We ended up having a foursome (for lack of a better word?) with another couple (male and female) several months ago. My SO went down on and then had sex with the girl while I played with her and while she performed oral on her male partner.

Her partner started showing me some attention and my SO immediately stopped having sex with the girl and took me a few feet away. The girl started playing with me

I was hoping that would cure his desire for a threesome. But it didn't. Now he's hounding me again about having a ""real threesome."" 

A few things are upsetting me about this.

1) He would NOT allow me to have a mfm threesome. He is jealous and possessive and can't stand the thought of another guy touching me

2) He is acting like it's my responsibility to find another girl

3) I made it clear that I was hoping the foursome would satisfy him and we wouldn't have to go through that again but he says it wasn't the same and he insists on a threesome with only two other girls and no other male present.

So I feel like I'm being a bit petty but 1) I feel like he basically got what he wanted already

He says it's not fair that I have been able to experience having a threesome and he hasn't. I said I did those things when I was single and I didn't have to take my partner's feelings into consideration

He is aware that I am ok with never having another mfm threesome again; it was fun but it's not like I am craving to do it again, I might be a little less resistant to his desire to have a threesome with another girl. But I feel like he's being a hypocrite expecting me to just bend to his will and do something I don't really want to do, and something he flat out wouldn't let me do.

So I guess my question is: am I being petty and ridiculous here? He keeps saying ""I don't understand why you have a problem with this. You like women."" I tell him ""You don't want me to have a threesome with another guy

Sorry for such a long post here but I need to know if I'm being as ridiculous as he's making me feel or if I have some valid feelings here.

(edit: should I also mention we have sex at least once a day? We miss a day here and there when I work an especially long shift and I have to catch up on sleep but that only happens maybe 2-3x a month. So it's not like he's being deprived

Now I'm away for work. He's at home. He went out on Friday with his best mate

He calls me the next morning and confesses to drunken sex in my house. Turns out he invited his mate and the girl to sleepover at our house. 

He's saying that I've always said mistakes happen and I would be forgiving. And that he told me as soon as he could.

I feel so betrayed

His friend says I should get over it as we sleep with others anyway and he was drunk. 

I keep going back to our agreement that solo play is not what we are doing now. I'm having a hard time focussing on work as I can't trust him when I'm gone.

My wife and I are in a monogamous marriage. We've always been monogamous together. I've always been monogamous in past relationships. She's had one or two threesomes with a past boyfriend

First, I should talk to my wife about my newly discovered non-monogamous leanings. I'm not the best communicator when it comes to relationship stuff, and I don't want to trigger any insecurities or jealousies (which most of us have to some degree) my wife may have as a result of her past relationship and bad experiences.

I want to be clear that I consider our marriage -- as a single entity -- to be more important than my individual desires, and maybe this is something I just need to let go?

Some of you have recommended books to other posters in a similar situation, if I decide to bring it up with her.

Second -- and I'm probably jumping the gun given the above -- is my confusion and fear about getting involved with someone else. A part of me believes that I'm capable of loving another person in addition to loving my wife, how can I get some definite answer as to whether I'm capable of polyamory, without jeopardizing my marriage?

Weird issues (I have my own issues, etc.  Just messed-up-ness.  I've had at least one awful experience over the years, and I'd say I'm disillusioned, not bitter.

So my dilemma is not an original one, but find myself very attracted to a new female friend, who I have been flirting with. I don't want to cheat on my wife. I'd like to keep my new friend. I'm wondering if and how it is possible to get past the attraction?

So

I am a 41 year old guy.

My wife: I have been with my wife for ten years. I love her with all my heart. She is the kindest person I have ever met. She is beautiful and smart and incredibly understanding and patient. She is there for me when I am down. We communicate well. She is the great love of my life, but it is varied and our kinks match and we have occasional threesomes and have played in swingers clubs and all that. I say this to clarify that we are reasonably broad minded, are not chained to convention, and also that I'm happy with what I have and don't need more. We are child free.

My friend: we met three months ago through work where I am in a senior supervisory capacity to her. We hit it off right from the start. She is outrageously younger than me (20 years). We have been talking outside of work, a whole new energy, and I would like a genuine friendship with her that will last a long time. She's a great person. The problem is, I am really attracted to her as well. She is very beautiful, and has admitted that she is really attracted to me too. Our chatting turned into hardcore flirting. I shut that down, as there are ethical conflicts at work here as well. I stop supervising her in a few weeks, which removes that constraint. The possibility of flirting more is there when that ends, in moments of weakness when I am tired or stressed or tipsy

What to do? Ideally, an annoying complication. My wife is fine with that friendship.

I'm playing with fire here, I'm very attracted to her. Ultimately, my relationship with my wife comes first. I couldn't forgive myself should I hurt her. When we play with a third, it is in a NSA, one night stand kind of capacity. My wife would not be OK with me (or us) sleeping with someone I have an emotional connection with. That is where our lines are drawn.

My wife is going through a period of illness

Any advice? Particularly from the 30+ crowd? Any questions I should be asking myself? I want to be thinking clearly.

This place was BYOB. So we brought a bottle of vodka and a bottle of rum with us. By the end of the night, couches and showers.

I had expected to chat with other couples, found a room where some interesting stuff was happening. We started fooling around with each other in that room as well. Then the other parties were done and left. So we were by our selves.

Later we ventured into a larger room where there were more people. Again we started kissing, being quite drunk and daring, started touching others around us. Soon she was a third person in a number of threesomes while I was sort of left alone. None of the girls in the couples she played with seemed interested in me. This was a bit of a blow to my ego.

After a short while, as she had been talking about the idea of being with two guys for a while. But it was over pretty quickly with him. She later told me that she pulled away from him when he poked her a bit too roughly, so the other couple left. There was barely any verbal communication

The problem I ran into, though my wife and I were very steamy with each other, there wasn't much action on my part. I know it was purely a mental thing because, as soon as we got back to our room, I had the most raging hard on. We had sex in the jacuzzi, on the floor, on the bed.

Sometimes I do think part of my problem is the lack of commitment

So I guess my question is...Can anyone relate, but I think I need outside advice esp from women who can relate.  For now I'm just taking my frustration out on my dildo and then falling asleep worrying that I will never feel balanced.  It sucks.

So, together for almost 6. Things are good in the relationship -- we're stable and happy. But, y'know, we fall into the category of ""normal"" married people right now. 

We were excited about the idea of having a threesome and experiencing that together. I was also completely drunk when I told him about it. 

So we continue having the discussion over the next few weeks. How would we pursue a third? He suggested going somewhere like the Bunny Ranch and doing that together. 

I posted an ad on OKCupid...then realized a couple things: 
a) Unicorn-hunting is a thing.
b) I've never been with a woman. This could be super horrible.

So that prompted another discussion: maybe I just look for a girlfriend? Maybe I get to see what all the delicious hype is about? 

Except then I'm just looking for dates...and I just feel weird about that. I want to share with my husband. He's of course ""allowed"" to date as well

So then we thought we'd kind of shift gears and just try meeting people in the poly community. I found a group on FB

We went to an event -- just an open mic night

It wasn't our style - lots of extroverts

So

I know that just sounded like whining. I was kind of whining. 

I guess I'm posting this because I know this is a journey -- that the point of all of it is to explore

But what are we looking for and where do we look? Are we talking about swinging? Are we just ""open?"" Am I poly and my husband is just a supporter? Do names even matter?

The thing is, and while I more than enjoy the sex I have with Danny, I very much need BDSM to be happy. It's more than just a like/hobby: I crave it and if I go without for any extended period of time, I get depressed and stop enjoying any kind of sex as much, which is something that's usually very important to me. That's the main reason John and I got back
together, we work more on a dom/sub level than as a couple.

The problem is that this makes Danny feel inadequate. He's very vanilla: while I like beatings and torture until I bruise and bleed, is making him feel like I'll never be happy with him, that I'll always need more.

I love Danny. He's so good to me, he's helped me through very rough times and I've done the same for him, and we don't fight about anything but this. I don't
want to split up with him

I get angry sometimes. I was so clear that this was what I wanted from the start
than I can control the fact that I need this, I let him know when
and where I'll be out, he feels betrayed and gets very depressed.

He says that he's absolutely convinced that it will get better with time, dirty that I can't just be a good little vanilla girl for him and make him happy, because I love him so much. I want to make things good for him, but I don't want to stop seeing John, get depressed, and resent Danny for ""making"" me stop and be monogamous. Danny doesn't want that either.

I’m going to name the characters for the sake of clarity here. The husband we’ll call Rick, Lori and I had sex after some courtship. Rick and Maggie had the equivalent of a one-night stand.

My wife is feeling a bit of insecurity about her dealings with Rick. She told me he confessed to having never been with an Asian before (She’s half Asian). He hasn’t been very responsive to her texts after Saturday night and he was in a rush to leave after the sex was over. So she’s feeling like he was maybe just trying to check off a list and move on. Maggie says she’s okay with that

I had a small issue with Rick as well, he wasn’t able to get things going for a bit and wound up removing the condom to continue. He pulled out at the end. His wife Lori informed me that this is exactly how she got knocked up with their first kid. He had pulled out but she got pregnant anyway. So, disregarding the disease risks for a moment (assuming they’re both clean) I think it was pretty disrespectful to risk getting my wife pregnant without any predetermined consent to take such a chance. Luckily, my wife is not pregnant. So it isn’t a huge disaster, but I want to make sure that something like that doesn’t happen again.

I’m not blaming my wife for this transgression because she’s a novice at this

So in summary

How do I bring up concerns and talk things out with Rick? Should I stay out of it, I don’t want to bring up concerns when the four of us are together because he may feel like he’s being attacked or singled out. I’d love to get some feedback on this situation from folks who’ve had to navigate these waters before.

I've been married for a very long time. I think we've both had ""emotional affairs"". I know I've fallen in love with one or two (or maybe even more) people over the course of the last 21 years. I know he's fallen in love with at least one other person that I know about. And each time it almost destroyed our marriage. 

Now I'm considering and have asked my husband if he'd consider opening our marriage to both sexual and emotional nonmonogamy. 
He's very nervous about the idea. He also has self esteem issues. I personally think if he got a girlfriend sexual or non it would help with that

Is it too late to open our marriage? How can I convince him this may be a good thing moving forward for the next 20 years? In other words can I get him on board?

Her friend has expressed that she loves this guy and is patiently enjoying the relationship with the positive outlook that it might progress into something more serious.

Not only does she feel tremendously guilty and fears that telling her friend will end their friendship, but the disclosure may also end her friend’s promising, potentially long-term relationship with this man. The quandary: Tell the friend about this drunken encounter and risk the above, or excuse it as a drunken blur and pretend it never happened?  

Regardless of my wife's guilt or fear of losing a friend

We believe he doesn’t know that my wife is sexually “available”, but I have no doubt that they were flirting in some way. My manstincts tell me that she was broadcasting tipsy signals that she was not just attracted to him, but also had a naughty side. (Sure, he was drunk and men are stupid, but his move involved a premeditated, calculated risk of success/failure). 

We've assumed that they don't also have an open relationship  ..it's possible, and dump her as an untrustworthy slutty-bad-friend-boyfriend-seducer. I've promised my wife that I'll keep my mouth shut and not to get involved in any way, or confront him for making a move on my wife behind my back (I haven't seen him since the incident, but I'll have a very hard time refraining from doing this).

So basically what my SO said was ""She was willing to have a foursome with me but she isn't willing to have a threesome and I don't know why. She likes girls, and I had no desire to do it again.  /head desk. 

Understandably

My SO also mentioned the part about how I was willing to do it in the past but not now. Luckily that didn't require any other details and Scott (who, she was single then, and it's different when you're in a relationship. You can't use that as part of your argument now.

He still wasn't getting it. I think at this point he is *choosing* not to get it because it invalidates his argument and he is clinging to straws.

Scott (at least according to him) told my SO he was wanting to have his cake and eat it too. Open relationships can't be one-sided like that and he can't ask things of me that he isn't willing to do himself. If he wants me to do a MFF threesome he should be open to a MFM threesome. He ended the conversation by telling my SO that regardless of anything else

So we shall we what happens. Ending the relationship is a very real possibility to me at this point because as many of you have pointed out

I've been a long time lurker of reddit in general and have visited this subreddit a lot. I'm in a polyamorous relationship with my girlfriend of 6 years. 

Anyways....tonight at a local craft beer bar a couple came in and sat next to me at the bar. We struck up a conversation and they said ""we've been dating for 4 years and we are in an open relationship"". This got me pretty excited to meet other open relationship type people in the wild. After I said that I was in an open relationship with my girlfriend of 6 years they said ""Oh we were just joking .. you're so weird I can't believe you are serious"". That got me a little down but I was being as polite as possible.

Over the course of the night the girl made a bunch of pot shots at me. For example I said I wouldn't want a tattoo because it is too permanent

In the end I was super polite and said thing to the effect of ""I totally respect your relationship and your lifestyle

In the end this experience left me really depressed and made me want to post on reddit. Any advice on how to deal with these issues in the future would be really helpful!

I am particularly interested in responses from people who are practicing this type of relationship. What are some things I can expect/wont be expecting and does anyone have any tips to make this work right. I love my wife and the last thing I want is to have a failed marriage because of this.

Back Story -

So without going into too many details to help you guys understand how we came to this discussion I'll explain a little.

My wife started dating my best friend originally but I always had a thing for her and he new it going in to the relationship. He was pretty much a dick/asshole to her all the time and would drag her to my house to play video games. After a while he stopped giving her the attention she wanted and she found it with me as she always had. One thing led to another and I no longer have this best friend. (I know shitty but thats just the way things worked out). During this transition period however she was seeing the both of us until she broke it off with him completely. Which was a very weird position for me to be in during the start of our relationship...

Fast forward a couple of months and we are well into dating when she gets pregnant at 19. After we had our daughter
Now

Now I'm not really a jealous person and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to ""date"" other women (just not seriously of course). I think this could work for us if we did things right. We are just both the kind of people that feel like monogamy might not be for us.

1372716424.0,1hgemd,Afraid of thinking outside of the box.,toofartofall2,17,4,14,"Hi r/nonmonogamy. I'm writing this because I'm facing a situation I thought I'd never face. First

Five years ago, former obese dude who was still a virgin at 24. I was almost 19 and just discovering my sexuality with another guy (a complete asshole.) I friend-zoned him, I admit it. So, my first male best friend had to bear with me until I finally realised I loved him as well. We immediately became a couple, learned how to make love, how to be in a fulfilling relationship and had an amazing first 2.5-3 years. We supported each other through very difficult times. We hardly ever argued, got along great with each other's family

However, basically so I could do that and still be with him. He didn't refuse. I slept with two different guys and told him. He didn't seem too upset about it. Yet, he didn't do a thing, even though I wanted him to.

Long story short

I did what I wanted during the 1.5 year breakup. Even tried to have a long distance relationship. Everything failed. No guy made me feel the way my ex did. I missed him

We got in touch again last January, and just talk. We didn't have sex. Nobody understood this. We didn't care. Sex became part of our relationship again in April. And, boy, it was amazing as always. Even better. I started to fall for him again. I lost interest in other guys, or so I thought. We're even planning to go to Europe together.

But he hasn't sleep with or loved any other girl but me, and so, with my ex's knowledge, I did. Neither of us feels guilt or shame. I had an amazing time, and that was all. I know I love only my ex. Fuck, I'd be his wife if he asked.

The problem is how can we find a balance between what we want and what is ""normal""? Is ""monogamy"" normal? My ex has always questioned that. He enjoys seeing me sexually fulfilled, I just fuck.)

So I have all these feelings like I have been cheated on and feel betrayed but in the back of my mind I think

 I was reading in a book talking about the concept of Sex 3.0 and how jealousy is unnatural and stems from sexual possessiveness. After reading over how a fenced in relationship can have all these unnecessary limitations on the relationship and your partner is like your property. Made me really examine my feelings and after accepting that sex is only a part of a relationship


So when we split up she expressed wanting to be friends and still being sexual together. I cannot help but think that the feelings I have come off as immature and counterproductive to being able to love a person unconditionally for who they are and accept the fact she still wants me in her life as a friend and companion

I was planning on giving her the last of her things tomorrow but now feel like i want to talk with her about this option. I feel like if she was able to finally be completely honest with me about all of the lying then we can move forward with this and still be able to share our love and affection for each other.

I am just looking for some advice here from someone that can help provide me with some understanding and maybe enlighten me on something I am overlooking in my situation.

I'm a female in my early 20s who is about to get married to my fiance of over 4 years. We have always had an amazing relationship and I have never doubted that he is my soul mate. However, and it has been that way for over 6 months now. We've been talking about it more and he's really trying, but we are both very busy and it has been difficult. 

Since I brought up our sex issues to him, because otherwise things are just going to build up. 

Here's issue number one: I've been thinking about sex with other guys a lot lately. When my fiance and I have sex, and I've seriously spent days thinking to myself and trying to analyze the situation to stop having these thoughts, but it isn't working.

Somehow I ended up talking to someone and they mentioned that their relationship was a little alternative and they described the situation. (More or less threesomes as long as both parties are attracted to the person). It got me thinking about non-monogamous relationships

I've been reading a lot about it just out of curiosity

Well last night we tried to have sex and he asked me again about the threesome thing

He hasn't spoken to me since then. 

I don't know what to do. I'm regretting that I even thought about it

I have no doubt in my mind that I want to marry him. He takes care of me and he fits all the things I imagined marrying in a man since forever. 

I feel like even if we did open our relationship, and he never would, and then it would ruin our relationship. 

If we don't open our relationship

Do any of you have experience opening a relationship with one reluctant partner in the beginning? I have never felt so confused. Thanks for any and all replies. 


**EDIT**: We finally talked about it last night and I was really pleasantly surprised by his reaction. He said he read a lot about open relationships and he said a lot of people who make it work say it was the best thing to ever happen to their relationship. He told me that he is able to distinguish between sexual desire and emotions, but that he will keep it in mind, and we'll talk about it soon. 

He asked me about having a threesome and said he didn't know if he felt comfortable having a threesome with two guys. I told him I've been interested in having one with another girl, needs to think about the entire situation more, and that we will be talking about it more in depth when we aren't so busy. 

I'm really excited that he's open to the idea, and he agreed that was good. 

Overall I'm really happy and excited about how it turned out. I'm excited that he listened to me and understood where I'm coming from.

I am in a theoretically open relationship with a man I am very happy with. However in practice we are monogamous. In the beginning we both would see other people but quickly other people became boring to me next to him. I have had a lot of lovers and a few significant relationships and my partner is so far the absolute best match I have found sexually and emotionally.

After a while I wanted to become exclusive because seeing other people felt more like a chore than anything. He wants to stay poly but has done nothing to act on that in over a year. I have gotten really comfortable with this monogamy and was completely blown away when I found out a few minutes ago he is on a date with another woman who is interested in having sex with him. I had no warning until now

The truth is part of me has wanted to be with other people but I have realized the only reason why is so that I don't hurt as badly when he finally sleeps with somebody else. I really am not actually interested in other people and don't know what to do. 

As a side note I am interested in exploring other people with him

**Tl;dr Though I was the original person interested in polyamory

The other player in this is my FWB

Sam travels a lot and does not actually live in my state. After the first time we went out, SO did not seem to have a problem with it or a re occurrence of the insecurity.

Present Day:

Perhaps unsurprisingly

Last week

A few strange incidents have happened since then. My email being left up on the computer and me not remembering opening it. My phone is open to my texts when I never leave it that way. I find him at my computer when he usually uses his own. Little things that are suspiciously adding up to something a lot like snooping.

Now

I have nothing to hide. I would never intentionally do anything to hurt my SO, if he was looking for something in my latest string of emails with Sam, he would have been bored to pieces as it was 25 emails of 98% nerdy shit 2% sex.

Since he's not going to find anything upsetting

Yet, he doesn't seem upset or angry. After being together so long, I can usually tell when something is up even if I'm not sure what ""it"" is.

Our communication is usually excellent

So

If he says nothing

Bonus Question:

Husband keeps saying that Sam's not a problem. I'm getting this odd feeling that just may not be true. Say I don't address the possible snooping. Should I stop seeing Sam

Also wrapped up in all this is my husband's desire to see me with other men. Sam has no problem with pix or vids. Husband gets a lot out of this. So if he really does have a problem with Sam (and I'm not a paranoid lunatic),False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,t3_1bq3oy

About a week ago

So over the weekend, but Emma is insisting they be alone for the first time. She makes a pretty good case, too - sex with me there, even as a spectator, would be different from them alone.

I encouraged her to set something up, but strangely my wife wants to go alone (really took me by surprise!)

So the story goes like this... Girl meets boy,friends who occasionally have casual sex during early twenties when both are single. Mid twenties to mid thirties boy is involved in three long term mono relationships, girl never liked or approved of the controlling restrictive nature of the girls that the boy was seeing. Girl and boy are still friends and catch up regularly. Girl finally tells boy to break up with the last one. He's never loved her, he's not happy with her, says ""you're an idiot, you could be with me"". Boy breaks up with restrictive girlfriend and comes to see girl. 

From here on

Bob and I have a series of talks before and after having amazing wild and kinky mind blowingly fantastic sex. Turns out the Bob is fairly damaged from these relationships and believes that it's too late for him and that he will never find love. He's not looking for love, he just wants to have fun.  

He's not in love with.  Me

I have just broken up with someone and am keen to date him exclusively

We drew up a set of rules. Safe sex with everyone else but each other. No close friends. Always tell each other when you are engaging in saucy behaviour with someone else. Veto rights on psychos (if one of us really doesn't like the other's choice in playmate, I'm important. 

He and I have found a third person

All sounds good so far

I'm not happy.   

I guess my problem is that I feel unrecognised in public. I'm proud to be with him and have taken him to a bunch of places to meet a bunch of my friends who all adore him and acknowledge him as my partner. He falls into that role very easily when we are out together with my friends. When we are with our shared extended friend group

Some of the girls that he is banging on the side sometimes occasionally and sometimes more regularly are part of the group and they have no idea that I am involved with him. He maintains that he is single and playing around. 

He refers to me in our talks as his ""primary"".  I feel like a secret as none of his friends outside the inner circle even know we've been doing this for over six months. I guess I feel that he may be ashamed of me or doesn't want my existance to cramp his pick up style as I am pretty sure that a few of them at least

He maintains that we're not seeing each other. We talk or text every day

I had a nightmare last night. In it

I was talking to our girl the other day and she said ""He just wants to fuck everything that moves."" She also told me that he had complained to her about a girl on the veto list (there are two on the list for him and one for me). I put her on the list as I think she's weird and I don't like her or trust her and she makes me feel uncomfortable. He was telling our girl that he really wants to fuck her and is frustrated that she is on the list. He tells me that he agrees that she is a weirdo and wouldn't go there again. 

I have been almost breaking up with him for about three months.  This is doing my head in. I suspect that if I bring up the ""I want to be recognised as your girl in an open and poly relationship"" chat

Complicating matters is the fact that my boyfriend is thinking about going to Australia instead (he has family there

2) My partner is more emotionally supportive and on the same page as me, like when they post lovey-dovey things to each other on facebook for their friends to see. It makes me feel guilty and lonely, maybe a little jealous too as they seem to think of him and his girlfriend as a mono couple. She is genuinely giving it a try but her friends and family are very negative about the situation, and since I haven't met my partner's friends or family yet, I wonder if they think of me as the other woman too.

I have been going under stressful ups and downs the last few months and I'm sure its been affecting her. She goes through them too and I'm expected to just grin and bear through it. 


I need sex. I hate that its true. Because one day I'll feel asexual, and I get excited. I don't want to live in a situation where the only thing that excites me is her. I'm tired of feeling like I'm addicted to her and that I need her just to exist. 

I'm tired of dealing with my heart feeling like its being punched in the gut and attacked. I had a panic attack today when I got my car after work. I didn't want to go home. But I did. 

I get home and I see all the full bore evidence of their love making and it makes me feel jealous. They don't even hide it. But she'll tell me she doesn't want sex from me one moment then force me between her legs to eat her out the next. 

I fucking hate this. So I've made up my mind. 

Right now

This is the only thing I can think of that will work for me. Every time I explain my relationship to anyone they tell me its abusive and that I need to get out. I'm going to. I promise I am. I'm leaving. I'm crying while I write this because I think my heart finally made up its mind over it. 

I think my heart finally decided it doesn't actually love her. I fucking hate her in fact. I hate all the pain she's put me through.

I'm not sure where I'm going with all this. I'll probably chicken out of actually moving. OR she'll do something to lock me back into what ever this mind fucked state of being is that she keeps getting me into.

I want to thank everyone for their comments. It really helped me stand my ground today when we discussed this because now I know I'm not being unreasonable.

Basically the crux of the argument: it hurts my feelings for him to want to be with another women, I don't want to do it again. His argument is it hurts *him* that I've done threesomes in the past (when I was single, in case you didn't read the other post) and was willing to do that ""with and for other people"", but for not him.

I tried explaining that it was a completely different situation because I was single

He disagrees

I kept trying to explain that it didn't hurt me in those situations because I had no romantic feelings for any of those people. I was not dating any of them. I was single. I was only thinking of myself. He still wasn't getting it.

I asked him ""Do you want to see another guy have sex with me?"" He said no. I said ""How do you not understand that I don't want to see you have sex with another woman?"" He said he understood that but just kept going back to his mantra of ""It hurts me that you will do those things with and for other people but not me."" 

I told him

It's like talking to a brick wall. He is not a stupid guy

edit: I also mentioned it irritated me that he had such a double standard about it being ok for him to do whatever he wanted with another girl but it wasn't ok for me to do the same with another guy. He didn't have much to say in response to that.

tl;dr He thinks because I have had threesomes in the past (while single) I shouldn't have a problem with having a threesome with him.

1357339304.0,15z44o,I am so confused about my girlfriend. ,VioletHyena,13,5,16,"I've been in a relationship with a woman (W) for the last 6 months. She has a live in boyfriend (M) who is fine with her having other paramours as long as they prove their STD status as clean. 

We had met over a year before we started dating, delightful company. She had been with M at the time for over 4 years, and the first night we met she Bit me with his permission. This left a majorly good impression on me (Me being a very primal person who enjoys biting and clawing during sex.)  Back then, she was also dating another guy (C) who I found disgusting. He was grossly dressed, a drunk, a deadbeat dad, chainsmoker a huge list of various adjectives that just make you want to vomit in his presence. 

His proximity to her in her life made me avoid her. Not because I wasn't attracted to her, I even sent her a message now and then asking her how she was doing with no response. 

Then magically she shows back up one day. I was currently in a open relationship with two other women

So W showed back up and discussed them with me, I wasn't getting my necessary affection that kept me sane and happy. 

So I met up with both of them at the same time and dumped them both together. Proud, she had always wanted someone like me who was primal. M was apparently not performing oral on her, so she also desired someone who liked doing that. Chaching, she kinda hit the jackpot with me. 

I LOVE going down on girls. To the point where I'm sexually satisfied when they orgasm from me just doing that. Someone once called me Stone because of this, I prefer it to be anal. She was up for that, using a strap-on on me etc. 

But we hadn't had sex yet. I wasn't even touching her naked body until after we got our blood tests back. Almost a month of us dating without going to the sexual. The most we had done was sat on my bed in my apartment and when she fondled my breast for the first time she had an explosive orgasm. She is very sensitive. It was beautiful


After the STD tests came back clean me and her started having regular trists in my bed

Then my world exploded. I was making a decent living, etc. And my living expenses were covered while giving me just enough to have an interesting time entertaining myself and taking care of her romantically (taking her on dates and out to events.) But I lost my job, and suddenly my income was cut in half, I was living off unemployment and it barely covered my car payment, let alone my rent. 

So she offered me room in her home. 

We had been dating for two months

Her and M had a pre-organized arrangement that any time he wants sex, I'm not attracted to M. Though his personality has worn on me and I can honestly as I love him almost as much as her, I will never been sexual WITH him though we on occasion were sexual with her together. Those times were always amazing, for me, for him, for her. We all enjoyed our little V. 

Then she dropped another bomb on me one day. She outright said she didn't love me anymore, and she wanted me to move out. It was sudden, I wasn't expecting it, and it all exploded out of her after she came home and found I had done her laundry for her. This apparently let something inside her snap. I questioned her, wondering where this came from. Wondering why. Our relationship wasn't that stressful, While I was needy, I didn't appear to be half as needy of her as M was. 

She couldn't tell me

I told her that I loved her, it was not meant to be an attack on her, just an observation. I had no desires for her to change for me. I love her how she was. I loved taking care of her while she let me live there. 

She looked me in the eyes and I asked her if she really didn't love me. She said ""Ha, Which means I lied."" Then proceeded to stare at me for a minute blinking her eyes as fast as she could. 

I'd had enough of the whole night, or for me to move out. Which ever one she decided. The argument had woken up her son and now he was crying, over the last 4 months of my relationship with her, he had bonded with me. He felt close to me, one day he even had tried to call me his other mommy, I laughed and told him no. That was inappropriate right now. 

I took him back to his bed

I spent a week at my moms, was trying to get me to send him more information about me, about my experience. His excitement, had me excited. And I couldn't hold back my own excitement. That night I drove back to W's, and talked to her about it. She was happy for me, but for the foreseeable future, we were not in a romantic or sexual relationship. She didn't want me leaving though. She did indeed see me as part of her family

I stayed, It has been a month and a half since I touched her for more than a hug. Yet suddenly shes touching me again. Trying to grab my breasts, being super flirty, I called her on it and she balked. I told her I couldn't stand her mixed signals they were driving me nuts. 

It seemed like every day it changed, sometimes without provocation. 

One day she came home and wrapped her arms around me, I simply stood up and hugged her. And she bit me again. Like she had that first night. Grabbing my hair roughly, pulling my head aside, and gnawing her teeth into my throat. She chewed until I cried Then we cuddled for a while. 

I've been working for two weeks now, took her to a nice restaurant and spent more on dinner for us than I had any previous relationship. She was happy again suddenly, giddy to be near me. 

We got home and laid down in bed

M Got home and she jumped up all excited, so far from me that I couldn't even touch her. So I cried more. I tried to keep it quiet, and I'm sure none of them realized I was actually crying. But my pillow was soaked. I hate this feeling. My heart all tangled up and broken. My intestines locked up till I can't even eat. 

I know what the majority of people are going to say. WHY fucking stay. 

I'm not sure why. right now I feel broken, I keep telling myself we're not in a relationship, but it doesn't help. It just confuses me more with how she had treated me up until we got home last night. 

I don't know what I'm doing. I love her so much

TL;DR: Skip to the last paragraph.

My boyfriend is amazing. Smart, ambitious, handsome, and our sex life is great (thought lately, not as frequent). We complement each other well, and learn from one another. I have been holding myself back from making plans for the future with him, but we've non-seriously talked about ""what if we got married"". He's great and I have no reason to break up with him.

Except that he wants to have sex with other girls. I'm only his third, and I've made some drunken mistakes that left me regretful. He hasn't made mistakes like this yet. I want to be open and inviting, but I know from experience that it can lead to more harm than good if you're not careful.

I understand where he's coming from. I want him to experience more and have fun. We've talked about having threesomes

We almost broke up a few months ago, and I can tell that he's not 100% happy. I don't really know how to go about finding someone to join us, and it makes me feel like we're a middle-aged couple trying to swing. Shouldn't this be easy?
He brought up having an open relationship.

Okay, but it consumes me and makes me miserable. For example, there's this girl that he briefly dated and had sex with once, about a month before he met me. Long story; I've had issues with her because he's gone on very date-like outings with her, and it makes me feel disrespected. Also, she's skinnier than me, younger than me, she seemed immature and vain. I know she wants him, but he knows it makes me unhappy.

He's talked to some other girls on OKCupid, because I wonder if they think that this is his new girl. I wouldn't take an ex to a party with my friends, because I know what people would think. It wouldn't be a big deal if they were old friends from high school, but he met her right before meeting me, and he had sex with her. I can't abide it, and I wonder if I can ever deal with other interests, or if it's just her.

I've recently updated my location on OKCupid, although I do need new friends in the area, so I'm hoping to meet new people. When I really think about it, I just wouldn't know how to begin that type of relationship. The relationship with my boyfriend is the best I've ever had, and I don't want to give that up. I'm not done with him yet, and not sure if I ever want to be.

So, with no one else playing that role (with the same going for him). I don't care if he goes out on dates with girls alone, but I don't want him parading them around in front of his friends. I don't want people KNOWING we're in an open relationship. Is there such a thing as a ""closed"" open relationship? Or am I too jealous for this ever to work, and should we just break up?

My wife and I have been looking at a swingers club near our area. Last week the owner offered us to stop by during their off-hours to check it out. The place was pretty nice and the owner told us it's a very respectful clientele and couples only night on Thursdays.

Thursday night comes. There were a decent amount of people but they were all much older and-I don't know a better way to describe it-not good looking. I hate judging people by their appearance

Finally, and I think Sabine was hoping to play with my wife. We told them about our boundaries and they completely understood. We chatted for well over a hour and had quite a bit in common. Sabine and I are in the same line of work and Tony was extremely funny. I know my wife is attracted to the funny men so I could tell she was comfortable. We went into one of the empty rooms and Tony and Sabine started getting frisky while we watched so we could get comfortable and get into the mood. Then my wife and I started making out and getting undressed. They stopped to watch us. No touching on their part, even though Sabine was enamoured with my wife's breasts. Soon, everyone is having sex. It was really hot and I could tell my wife was getting into it. Unfortunately, there were other people coming into the room and wanting to join us. Tony was quick to tell them no. They were polite about it and didn't try to force their way in, but it did get annoying to constantly break the mood just to tell others no. On the last one, Tony said to the guy

After we were done

My wife and I had a great time and hope we can meet Tony and Sabine again. I have a bit of a desire to see my wife with another man and I think Tony would be a good fit. I know she found him attractive and I felt comfortable with him. I have no idea if Tony and Sabine would be up for it and I haven't talked to my wife about this fantasy yet.

I met one of my closest friends (henceforth known as Z) a bit more than a year ago, Z and I started sleeping together in November. 

At the beginning of April I started a temporary job where I met another man (G) with whom I hit it off right away. G had just left an engagement and was really on the rebound

I have now been dating G quite successfully for about two weeks. Yesterday he and I talked about our comfort zones and the boundaries of our relationship. In a conversation that we had before we started dating I had told G that recently I had mostly been hooking up with friends rather than dating, at least at this time, with me having a second boyfriend. He said that after breaking off the long term commitment to his ex fiance he is still trying to get back into the mindset nonmonogamy.

So my issue really is whether or not I should tell my boyfriend that my fuckbuddy also happens to be a very close friend of mine, in which case I would certainly want and need to hear his concerns. It also seems that maybe as time goes on and G becomes comfortable once again with nonmonogamy, he might be less bothered by the nature of my friendship, so I don't know if ""waiting it out"" a bit might help him take the information more calmly. Since he said it's fine for me to have a friend with benefits, I don't know if he even needs to be told who it is at all. What do?

We've been married for over a decade and have two kids, but life, kids, fatigue, etc., often get in the way. 

Until we had kids, and I only experimented with her because I wanted to make her happy, and because I didn't want to be a drag. Pre-kids, we did a little swinging, a couple threesomes, a little light poly living, but we never actually slept with anyone else. 

Then

Because of this, my wife freaked. It took a long time to repair the damage. 

Now I'm in a strange place, and has expressed a desire to explore other people. She hooked up with one guy and she traded a lot of really hot sexts with another guy. She doesn't see either of these as a problem, but I kinda freaked out on my own now. 

I don't want to restrain or ""own"" her, alone, were enough for her. I doubt that I am, though. In some way, I think it would be easier if she would just sleep with someone else behind my back and I wouldn't have to know about it. But that doesn't seem like a very positive or easy way to live either.

Background info here:

My [19F] SO [21M] of 4 years and I have been monogamous from the beginning, great sex, great social life together and apart from each other, all in all I wouldn't trade him for the world.  I definitely need a few more years but I would love to marry this guy, one day.

 The issue:

We got together when I was fairly young, as I feel that I am fully satisfied with our sex/love life.  But I do wonder about hooking up with other women.  I have done it in the past twice, once before being with my SO and once while we were together (He was okay with it and was present in the room, along with the girl's boyfriend, and they watched).  I also have a lot of sexual fantasies about women.  I feel like I may be bisexual, but I'm just not sure because I haven't really had a lot of time to experiment with these feelings.

So, so I ended up spending a lot of time with her just talking and catching up and stuff.  After we left he was making jokes about how she wanted to steal me away and this actually opened up a conversation about my sexuality.  I told him (and this is how I still feel) that I don't see myself in a relationship with another women, heck I don't see myself with anyone other than him, but I am sexually attracted to women.  He pretty much told me that as long as I tell him about what I'm doing, he doesn't mind if I want to play around and have sex with other women.

Now, even kissing, another women makes me feel sick. --

**[Some people may point out here that it isn't fair that I want to hook up with other women but don't want him to- but since he has assured me that that is *not* what he wants, I would not want to do it either.]**

-- I feel the same way about the idea of me being with other men- it just makes my skin crawl and my stomach hurt.  I honestly wouldn't care though if he wanted to try anything sexual with other men

I just have so many apprehensions about starting to hook up with other people. Since except for the one time I hooked up with another girl while we were together, its a deal-breaker for me. I'm really glad he's open to letting me explore my sexuality, but I'm really worried about the ramifications of actually doing this.

I just really wish I could have met this incredible guy a little farther down in my life

**TL;DR: My amazing SO of 4 years has told me that he is open to letting me sleep with other women to explore my sexuality, as that would be a deal breaker for me.**

Fast Forward to when she returns: She realizes she's fallen for him

Fast Forward to Today (3 weeks after return): I still feel slighted that she forbids me from dating outside the relationship. She has repeatedly stated that she doesn't want me dating because it obviously won't be temporary, and that I still feel slighted. Perhaps I should have been lurking here at the time.

He doesn't believe in monogamy and after being with him for quite some time I realized monogamy isn't ideal for me either. So

When deciding to change our relationship status on FB he wanted it to read ""in an open relationship"". I did not. I feel it is not anyones concern whether our relationship is open or not. He complied and we let the world know we are in a relationship. 

Today I realized that is relationship status is no longer on his FB. When I asked him he said he hid it because it makes hooking up with other girls difficult. That it makes initial contact hard. I feel he is putting precedent to random chicks feelings and possible hookups with other girls over our relationship. Am I just being sensitive and the end of the conversation I feel in the wrong but I feel like I shouldn't be. If that makes and sense.

She wanted an emotional connection outside of our connection and I have quickly come to the realization that having that connection

All was well and good with her as she had friends online that she was interested in but had not acted until we agreed, some things were easy others much more difficult. The second one I've been able to deal with better, but still feel the green monster time and again, especially right now as she is spending a few days with him. Not so bad so far right? well in the beginning I had trouble and she tried to hook me up with one of her friends, it didn't pan out but then I met someone myself. We too are now dating and jealousy has reared its ugly head on my wife's side.

She has admitted that in an ideal world she would like to do as she pleases while i stay home and be a good boy. She admits that this is not a fair feeling and she does not enforce that. However when i speak to her she gets jealous and angry and lashes out, and see a lot of her issues as well as mine. It really is eye opening. 

The result is we are still best friends but she tends to put up these walls so our intamacy and closeness is a little less lately as I think shes pulling away cause shes hurt and not dealing with the real issue of why she feels that way. Is this common? Do you guys have this when you started? Anything i can do to continue to assure her that I'm not going away I always do

My wife and I are around her age. They're also very open about their relationship in public, despite the fact that it is far from the accepted societal norm (which I certainly take no issue with). When we go out together, my wife and I enjoy it. However I do sometimes feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when I catch people staring or hear them making comments about seeing our group, despite the fact that we haven't yet progressed to open displays of affection outside the bounds of the individual couples. 

That being said, and would like be whatever the equivalent of ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" is in poly couple terms, haha. Part of me is interested, and I can definitely see myself developing real, serious feelings for both of them and wanting to spend more time together, both in and out of the bedroom. Another part of me is nervous about doing something like this.

In any case, she's mentioned that either would be interesting. I think it would be pretty exciting as well! I know that my partner has all of these wonderful traits, that she's got a lot going for her, and the idea of showing her off and seeing her have fun with someone I recommended for her tickles me. It also gives me a chance to personally screen folks I don't think would be right, which helps regarding being in the loop.

My question is this: how on earth should I go about advertising for my gal? I don't know if I've heard of this sort of thing anywhere. We're both fairly introverted, and just lay our cards out on the table? Should I be taking control of her account (with her permission, of course!) and sending out messages for her?

I'm in a long-term marriage with kids. Originally mono for a very long time. We have explored non-mono together for a while and are only fairly recently exploring separate dating relationships. 

I am involved with two other men whom I very much enjoy in entirely different ways. We confide in each other and provide emotional support to one another.

I found this out during Thanksgiving. He then asks me if I would go on his trip as he can't imagine leaving me behind. Since I happen to have an former lover from my travels living in that country

A few days later I fly out. The first night, ""He's my boyfriend, too"" I scoffed. This is because we'd never referred to my boyfriend as their boyfriend. Honestly, part of me figured that he was with them more as an outlet for his bisexuality (this is the only man he's ever been with) but as it's come out now that it's a relationship. The wife is in school most days during the week, so I don't see much of her. What I do see, however, is the incredible amount of care and attention she gets from both of them. It makes me really jealous- I was pretty attention-starved as a child and it's one of my major issues-I can't help but feel competitive. When we first were discussing how we wanted the time there to go, to which he replied that was good to know and nothing ever came of it. At one point, spent it with my former lover

We'd been planning to take a trip together to a neighboring country for a few nights, telling me he's been open with me the whole time about who he is and maybe this isn't what I want and I said, for the umpteenth time that it WASN'T what I wanted- that I wanted to be monogamous at the start and open it up later because it was really hard to try to build up a new relationship and focus on nurturing old ones and what the fuck I was doing here with all of them, anyway?? So, we're having this really shitty conversation and then he asks me what my plans for the weekend are because I have to leave so that he can have alone time with them when the wife is home from school. I wasn't sure what the weekend was going to look like partially because our plans away had been changed and I thought the couple would be understanding about their weekend plans changing, too. He starts freaking out that I have no plans and being like, ""Well, ""Why is the solution for us to leave all together so you don't see them at all?"" I really think it was just intended to make me feel bad. When we went back, accusations. Finally, nothing. He barely looks at me. We went out for the day by ourselves and ended up fighting more- same stuff back and forth. He's worried I'm going to break up with him because this isn't what I really want
I worry that we are fundamentally different. I think that my approach to nonmonogamy is less polyamorous and more about sexual openness. I love the idea of him and I having sex together with people, but he doesn't really understand what I'm talking about because he can't understand how I can have sex with the same people multiple times (FWB) without developing deeper feelings. I can't imagine being in love with multiple people. He has a few long-standing sexual relationships, both with this couple and with another woman from college who also lives far away. My impression is that it's just the distance getting in the way of him being in relationships with these people, whereas for me it's the fact that I don't want to be in relationships with people I've had FWB situations with.

We fly back and then on the train home, argue more. Finally, he came over last night on my request and I mention being worried about the fact that his couple is going to be moving back here at some point and I'm not sure what that will look like- I'm worried that our fundamental approaches to nonmonogamy are different. He then wants to talk about the terms of our relationship- as it stood, he had told me he just wanted to be with the couple and I could be with anyone I wanted. Now that he's away from them, he's telling me that he either wants monogamy for a while or wants the freedom to be with whomever he pleases, too. I'm resenting the fact that it seems to be about HIS convenience. When I wanted monogamy in order to get a solid base, it wasn't convenient for him because he had plans made already with this couple. I'm not even sure why we were discussing changing the terms in the same breath, but I resent him trying to limit that since I've been very accepting of the relationship most important to him.
My question is, asking him once again if he was in love with them, and he told me that, ""He doesn't even know what that means."" I just want to focus on building us up right now, as I did at the beginning, but now when I think about being monogamous it makes me feel really constricted, but I don't know if that's just coming from a place of wanting to get back at him for how hurt I felt during our time away, especially for the wife,self,

---

**Some background:**

I'm a virgin, and general sexuality.

My best friend is a girl (call her S) whom I had off and on romantic feelings for while she was dating other guys

**Current situation:**

I have been dating a girl (call her C) who is polyamourous for about a month and a half now. We met over OKCupid and we have been extraordinarily open with each other from almost the very beginning. We're done some... I guess what might be called ""heavy petting"": making out nearly naked and some nipple play, and while I've found that I've had no problem with her meeting and sleeping with other guys, I'm getting myself tied in knots over the idea of her falling for another guy. From a sexual point of view I think I'm perfectly fine with her seeing other guys, and I think I would be in a longer term relationship, but from the emotional side of things I'm not yet sure I can handle poly.

I know that I need more experience in relationships, the incredible level of openness and comfort I've had with her, or if I'm just genuinely falling for her. My inexperience is a pretty confounding variable here.

I'm not sure whether I need force myself to emotionally disconnect a bit

I guess what I need to ask is:

1. Does anyone have any advice / insight for an inexperienced person in a poly / nonmonogamous relationship?

2. How do you manage the emotional side of things? Are poly relationships usually emotionally open?

I've exhausted all options for therapy in my area and trying to find therapy all my life has given me post traumatic stress disorder and severe anxiety disorders in the process.

I now feel like I want to pursue no strings attached fun outside of our marriage and that we are mature enough and communicate well enough to make it work. My husband was completely supportive of this and after several long discussions we have decided to try non-monogamy. We are still figuring out all the details of what we are comfortable with and how exactly we are going to proceed. 

That being said my husband and  I both created OKC profiles with no pictures or anything that could really identify us just to kinda see who is out there in our city which is not very big. My husband and I are very private so our intention was to try to keep this decision between just the two of us.

Throwaway here. Here's a bit of backstory: 

I'm in a really great, not just for me (though that undeniably sounds great too!) Until recently she has said she wouldn't be interested in bringing a third into our bedroom - not due to jealousy or anything, but due to issues of being too self-conscious and worried about her 'doing things weirdly.' She had a conservative, very sex-negative upbringing, (though over the course of our relationship she has been blooming into quite the exploratory, sexy thing.) 

Anyway, but there's one problem: due to her shyness, she says she'd be way too self-conscious about actually bringing it up. She says it would have to be someone really close to her to have her be comfortable with the idea of a threesome, but she's just really afraid of making things awkward and being embarrassed for bringing it up with anyone. 

**Important Clarification*: I think the real trouble for her is about knowing whether or not *they* are interested in it - it sounds like once she knows that this is something the other girl would like to do




We're in the same friend group here at college, my GF's public persona has always been totally non-openly-sexual (though she's quite the sexdemon in the sack!) I, on the other hand, have always been quite sexually open and am known for playing that up along the rest of the guys socially (I've enjoyed living the life of a crazy swingin' charmer vicariously through my friends so far :P). It's for this reason that I feel pretty strongly that it'd be the much more appropriate/correct/less-creepy/polite thing to do to have *her* be the one to bring it up to one of her friends (we have two in mind currently), since I think it's pretty clear already in everyone's mind that I'd be totally down with such a thing and it would be her consent/interest that's in question - and as I've always heard anyway, it's usually most important to have the same-sex-as-the-third partner give the invitation to join. 

What do you think we should do? Is there any advice you could give my GF to overcoming her fear of bringing it up in conversation (she's a Redditor, so it'd be great to find a way to make it work!

1359444187.0,17hhla,SOme deep seated problems I am having with my FWB of 3+ years. ,yikes3,11,5,12,"First off I am using a throwaway. I'm typing this pretty late at night. I'm feeling kind of down and I can't sleep. (I tried taking sleeping meds so I'm a bit drowsy lol.) This post may be a bit unorganized and scatterbrained so *please bear with me!* 

I've been intimate with a guy for 3 years now. It's to the point where he phones me literally everyday and worries about me if I don't answer or I don't phone him. It's not even text messages it's a full on conversation. We talk about personal things a lot and I can talk to him about literally anything and everything including all the issues that I'm going to bring up. I would consider him a good friend with benefits and I think he would consider me the same. Even though we talk everyday I only see him about once every two weeks. 


My friend is in an open relationship

I decided to stay friends with my friend but it's really difficult because I can't visit him at his own home anymore since his husband is almost always home. I tried to visit for a few minutes back in 2010 and I ended up crying after 15 minutes of being in the same room with him. I can't phone my friend either because I'm afraid that his husband will pick up. When I first got to know my friend I tried asking my friend over for the night and he refused. He said that he didn't want to leave his husband at his house. I respected that for 3 years and it's getting to me right now. I talked to my friend about this and he said there's nothing really stopping him from doing so right now since things changed...but I don't have a bed right now...I'm sleeping on my couch. I still find it uncomfortable for me to ask since he made a big deal about him leaving his house.

I know his other friend who has sex with his husband spends a lot more time with them. I'm really jealous. He even went to gay pride parade with them both. I rarely leave my house let alone leave with them to gay pride parade. I'm really jealous that their friend was treated nicely by both of them and didn't end up getting mistreated and abused. 

I mentioned poly offhandedly and he said he doesn't believe that it could ever work. I just mentioned it though

It's just depressing that so much of our friendship is hindered by what happened when his (drunk) husband got involved. On one hand I wish things between me and my friend were official

I'm interested in poly, so I'm pretty much a total n00b. My relationships have all been monogamous (I was even married for 5 years) so it wasn't anything I serious considered pursuing as a possibility. 

I'm currently in a relationship with a lovely young lady and we've been seeing each other for almost 5 months. We're in love

About a month and a half ago my roommate expressed feelings for me. I've known her for years and have always been quite fond of her, so I instinctively declined. I told my girlfriend about it, and she was generally nonchalant about the whole thing.

A few weeks later, but she has trust issues with a past boyfriend sleeping with the another woman they brought home behind her back. So we agreed that if we involve other women, it's only when we're both present. I am ok with that, but I still feel the same about it.

So now a few days ago my roommate is back saying she's still interested in me and is having trouble getting over me. I declined again and told her I wouldn't leave my girlfriend, I just don't know how to put them together.

1354122918.0,13xwlv,Other people's relationship rules; on breaking them.,sparr,6,1,0,"[This is something I posted to my personal public journals elsewhere

Like many of my writings about my decision making process, and thoughts, this one is about planning ahead. I like to make broad categories of decisions in advance so that I don't have to make them on short notice. I have more time right now to think about these things, to collect the views of my friends and peers, to weigh consequences and repercussions, and generally to make a good decision than I will when it comes time to put that decision into action.

You probably think this post is about sex and cheating. You probably think ""don't be involved in other people breaking the rules of their relationships"" is a pretty straightforward statement, so let me start by thoroughly stepping outside that box. My take on this whole concept is a work in progress, but more often than not my reaction to such situations is going to be ""She knows more about her relationship than I do. I'm going to let her make those decisions and she is responsible for the consequences. I may impose honest communication requirements on her as a condition of my participation."".

[note: I'm going to use gendered terms here and talk about a hypothetical girl and her boyfriend

First and foremost, especially if the she isn't actually willing to Y when she does X, but at that point it degenerates to one of the other three cases. The first one is actually the easiest, because then they both have a simple way out of the relationship, although in reality the first one rarely exists without being surrounded by the second one. The possibility to renegotiate actually changes the nature of rules significantly, as does her willingness to communicate about them to her partner or to me.

Another factor that plays a key role here is initiation and intent. There is a difference in her asking me for sex and me asking her for sex, changes as the importance/significance of the rule changes. There is, hopefully obviously, another difference in me asking, depending on whether I know or not. For the sake of this discussion, let's assume I know at least something about her rules (communication problems are covered later).

There is also the consideration of timing. How is the situation different if what I am doing with her is ongoing, permanently shared a room and a bed with a monogamous girl with whom I was, completely or to some significant degree, not intimate. If she entered a new relationship and her partner tried to create or enforce a ""no living with another guy"" or ""no just-sleeping with another guy"" rule, is that different than if she asked to move into my house or room with me after their relationship and rules already exist?

Plenty of people will try to break this down into a discussion about how she should deal with the rules she doesn't want to follow, but it's moot in this context. No matter what I say to her, and what she says to her partner, their relationship might still exist with the rules unchanged afterwards. If the nature of the relationship changes, great, but for the sake of this discussion let's assume that it doesn't. So if your response to this whole post is ""tell her she should renegotiate or break up"", that's unhelpful, by far

Just to ensure most of you have left behind the ""breaking her relationship rules is always bad"" idea, or someone snitches on her, I'll defend our actions to him. If someone else insults her for talking to me, I'll defend her to them, as much as I'll defend my own choices in discussions about this post. All of that also applies to ""never be alone with other guys"" or ""never be out in public with other guys"" or ""never ride in another guy's car"", which I am happy to bundle together into a category about which I'll have no second thoughts and can't think of any exceptions to, in every permutation of all of the considerations mentioned above.

If you wouldn't talk to her, friendship, and relationships. You can keep reading, but I don't think there's much to gain for either of us in discussing anything I'm going to cover below if we can't agree on the above. If you want to debate me on any of this, it may prove more productive to limit our conversation to the earliest point on which we disagree.

Now that that's out of the way, and in what situations that line moves. At the other end of the spectrum (you know, because relationship rules lie on a number line, in a monotonically increasing order... right...) we have the rules ""don't fall in love with other people"" and ""don't engage in [some degree of] sexual activity with other people"". These rules, and the breaking of them, are very different, including different practical and emotional results and different concerns in the decision making process.

If she is falling in love with me (or with someone else, I'll be ok with pursuing a relationship with her. If he doesn't want to be with her because she wants to be with me, he can break up with her, or she can break up with him, or they can even maintain some turbulent ""maybe we can work this out"" sort of arrangement. My only requirement is that he be informed and that she be honest with both of us about what's going on. If she can't do that, then we will remain friends, and our relationship won't progress in the direction she wants it to.

Another consideration that has some weight is how rules change in the telling. It's like a game of telephone. Her boyfriend wants to establish the rule ""don't become physically intimate with other people"" but what he says is ""don't sleep with other guys"". The message that reaches her brain is ""don't spend the night with other guys"", and in some cases gained. To some people, the original rule would seem mostly intact at this point, but to someone for whom bedroom (or elsewhere) play time means a lot more than intercourse, almost everything has been lost. If she appears willing to do things other than having sex with me, and what she's told me is that she can't have sex with me, I have no way of knowing that what we are doing will appear to her boyfriend to be breaking their relationship rules. I will always make an effort to suss out the real rules, when in truth what I distrust is the reliability of information transfer from her boyfriend's brain to her mouth. I cannot control how successfully things are communicated from her boyfriend to her, and no penetration"". It only took a few questions for me to narrow that down and illustrate some of the relevant differences to her, relationship with her and can look forward to playing again in the future.

The final major consideration for me is long term practical consequences. Everything above is about dealing with interpersonal consequences, etc. All of that is also related to decisions that can be changed on a moments' notice (you can stop sleeping with someone at any time). Separate from all of that is another category that includes objective matters that can't be conveniently dismissed. I've had trouble writing some of the guiding rules for this category, so I'm going to fall back to examples here. I will never get a girl pregnant if her other partner(s) don't want that. I will not enter into important legally binding contracts, including business partnerships or marriage, with a girl who I have a relationship with, who is also in another relationship, if there are significant unresolved issues related to conflicts between those relationships. I won't allow the two of us to expose a third party to life changing legal consequences that they haven't consented to (getting a ticket because we were naked in your car, and I hope to be able to distill out broader and more effective base rules for this category in the future.

Now, and a few more will have breezed through all of this with no qualms about ever respecting others' rules, but most people reading this article will have, at this point, put roughly the same selection of things above into the ""ok"" and ""not ok"" boxes. Where that consistency is going to break down is with regards to physical activities, particularly intimacy. Some of you are going to say that breaking almost any rules about physical intimacy is bad. Some of you are going to say that it's not. Plenty of you are going to draw the line somewhere in the middle.

As I said above

Some activities may seem intimate to one person, or participating in therapeutic/medical things like exercise, yoga, massage, meditation, etc.

Some activities can be intimate, kissing, massage, being naked in each others' company.

Some activities can be intimate, but might not be sexual. This category includes a wide range of fetish and kink activity, far more than I could enumerate here.

And

I'm going to end this writing in somewhat of an anti-climactic manner. I explicitly can't draw a bright line dividing all of those activities by acceptability like I did with some of the items at the extremes earlier in this post. For every act that I just described I have both broken and repeatedly chosen not to break someone's relationship rules under different circumstances. Every factor I mentioned above comes into play in how I make decisions about physical intimacy, even if you don't agree.

I (24/f) have been dating a great guy (24/m) for 2 years, due to jealousy. I struggle with this a lot because I'm bi and I have been craving sex with a woman for quite some time.

He will never find out unless I admit it. I have to tell him, when I'm back home? I really messed shit up, huh? Does anyone else have any stories like this that ended well? I love him.

I'm demisexual myself so I don't feel sexual attraction unless I'm already in love and it takes a bloody long time to come around. Therefore I don't really understand the whole 'I really need to fuck this person even though I don't love them' thing that people often go through in relationships. A strong emotional connection and sex are completely linked for me as I cannot separate them however I understand how other people can. This led to me rethinking what I thought was important in relationships and honestly


Due to this epiphany of sorts


Obviously there would be rules but my new ideal would involve neither of us taking up the opportunity because we were satisfied with the relationship we had. The open relationship part would just be there to take the pressure off of the relationship. It would allow both of us to be able to pursue small flings if we wished or allow us to explore different parts of our sexuality that the other partner might not want to indulge. 


I definitely know that romantic connections would be off the table because I don't know if I could handle my partner falling for someone else. I'm monogamous in the emotional sense and technically in the physical sense unless I was extremely good friends with someone. 


I feel fairly comfortable with the idea and although jealousy would be an issue


However most people I have talked to this about have either laughed at the idea or thought it was wrong and unnatural to think a relationship like this would work. Right now I feel like I'm a bit of a freak for thinking about this and having the view of not wanting to limit my partner too much if they really wanted to have sex with other people. I just feel like this kind of a relationship would be healthier because the monogamy would be a choice but not essential.

So is this weird? Am I strange for thinking that having sex with someone else while in a relationship doesn't diminish the love you have for your partner? Polyamory's not for me but I still feel like I'm strange for thinking like this.

Swingers' websites seem like the other obvious option, but it's a question of which to use. What I've seen looked fairly US-centric, and we're in the UK. Also, I get the impression that the swinging community trends much older. I'm 23, she's 21

But how do I distinguish between those who genuinely want to play with a couple and those who are willing to accept the inconvenience of another man to get to the woman?

I'm a person that will only be comfortable being monogamous in a serious relationship. The thought of sleeping with someone besides my partner or my partner sleeping with someone else give me equal amounts of stomach pain. The thing is I'm starting to wonder how unreasonable that is.


I feel that Nonmonogamy seems a little more natural then a two person sexual relationship. When you mention an open relationship most people think about their SO having sex with someone else and have a negative reaction


I think it comes down to three things religious beliefs


What I'm trying to say is that I'm starting to feel it's unreasonable to expect anyone to desire wanting to have sex with one person for the rest of their lives. 5 years

You often hear stories of people opening up their relationships or deciding that the type of relationship for them is a nonmongamous one. Never the other way around nonmonogamy is a step forward in sexuality

Whether or not the person I'm with realizes that they want a more open sex life it will still have an effect on the relationship. Resentment can build

Even though I'm not comfortable with the idea I feel like i should be. As if i should begin this journey where the destination is sexual acceptance

Of course there are people who only want monogamy but because there are people who are better suited in a nonmongamous relationships that don't even consider it because they have never been told that it is an option.

There are people in open relationships that dont want to be there. People are in monogamous relationships that want out. There are people who know what they want and people that don't. You should always consider your options.

Is it reasonable for me to start to change myself in order to become someone that can be able to make that transition when it does arise?

She never knew about a side of me that I had been combatting since I was 17 years old. I had and was still having sexual conversations with men and women on Plenty of Fish

Rewind to when I'm still loving with my mother

Fast foreward half a year of me living in the city. I meet a girl on nexopia that I become pretty serious with. Very serious. Serious enough that I spend the 200 dollars to see her in her hometown 9 hours away. This is the first time ive met anyone that ive talked to online in person before. It's one of the most amazing times of my life with a woman. It felt so right.

Just back home after the trip, and I end up repeating the same behaviour, and feel extremely guilty for caving back in. This goes on over and over again and becomes more and more physically exhausting.

One day, and my confusion in my own head as to why I am doing this, I still let it happen. Extreme guilt afterwards. Confusion about my sexual orientation, confusion about why I let it happen, about whether I should tell my girlfriend... But No. I keep it inside, hoping I can just make it go away.

These encounters happen again and again for months

Then, and that our relationship had changed, became more distant.

The last time she came to visit me, i dont try to justify it... theres no justifying this as if it were right. I tell her how i've been chatting with men and sending pix... but that's it. I left out the fact that i've been meeting them AND women for over half of the time I was with her. I thought that leaving out some of the more harmful things would keep us together, have her at least keep SOME of her trust and give me some time to fix things without her knowing.

I've nearly lost all her trust by now... But now that i'm contronted with having to find a reason for this behaviour

After a trip home to see my family and tell them what i've told my girlfriend, saying she might be pregnant. While texting her, i mistakenly send a text to my girlfriend. I make up some bullshit story about how its a friend asking me for advice and how this friend might be pregnant... I know deep down that my girlfriend doesnt buy it.

My girlfriend says she wants to ask my ""friend"" what her side of the story is. This is where I now know that keeping up a charade and continuing to lie is useless now

She now knows everything. Every detail, and do all these disloyal things behind her back... And neither do I.

In the situation of seeing the MEN though, it's just while i'm aroused and watching porn or I randomly think of it, I end up talking to men. Any other time than that, Theyre not on my mind not even when I was having sex with my girlfriend. If i'm bisexual deep down, thats fine, but thats not the point.

during Every encounter I had, they never stuck strong enough to really MAKE me stop this behaviour, even though I would have given the woman I was in a relationship with the world and everything.

I'm now taking sexual addiction counselling, and feeling unfathomable guilt afterwards, yet repeating it).

So, emotional depth of my brain is so lost or disconnected that I Tell someone I love them, have true, deep feelings of love for them, and yet commit such disloyal, painful, backstabing acts

My boyfriend is someone I have known since I was 12 or 13. We met online and I have come to live with him and his family.

My other significant other is my Dominant. My boyfriend met him at school and introduced us. Sir and I have been together with my Boyfriends good wishes since around March 2012.

With Sir, things are equally fine. We have sex fairly frequently. I love my Sir a great deal.

With boyfriend things have gotten more and less rocky on different issues. Recently I don't feel like Boyfriend really understands me or my depression. He has a very cynical approach to a lot of life these days

Then comes the matter of bedroom. Boyfriend and I haven't ever had a stellar bedroom experience. He doesn't have a single dominant bone in his body and I am extremely submissive. He has tried domming me and its failed spectacularly. I just can't submit to his style of domming. When we do have sex it feels very detached, clunky, and just barely satisfying enough for him to get him off. He doesn't ever get me off, and it isn't because he hasn't tried to. . . but more because hes tried and tried and we always just both end up giving it up. The result is him and I basically never having sex, and when we DO it only for his relief. It'd far more awkward than just him jacking off in private, so that's what normally ends up happening.

Because of these two issues. . . I feel emotionally distanced from him despite knowing he really does love and care for me. I love and care for him as well. When we hang out and watch movies or tv or play video games. . . we have great discussions about them and really enjoy our time.

But deep in the back of my mind I have this dreading feeling that this is NOT enough to make a relationship around. I feel wrong for sticking around despite actually loving him. I feel like he is only letting me be with Sir because he knows if he says no. . . I will resent him or leave him over it.

I wouldn't leave Boyfriend if he said I couldn't be with Sir. But I WOULD go back to being depressed much more often. This plagues me with guilt.

Boyfriend is a MASSIVE introvert and doesn't know anybody else. And I know if I left he wouldn't put any effort into finding anybody else. He would be all alone.

I don't know what to do. Is it right to stay with Boyfriend if he continues to say he is fine with how things are? I don't feel its healthy to continue never having sex,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,t3_16e174

I also began to realize over time that these two women both had clinical mental issues. After further inquisition

Anyways the question(s): Are there any of you who are polyamorous and in open relationships who are mentally healthy? Did you make the conscientious choice that this relationship type just makes you more happy?

I just need some proof that there are well-adjusted, but I do not mean it offensively.

(EDIT: I worded some things a bit strongly so I would like to apologize to those I offended. I would also like to thank everyone for their insight and perspectives.)

EDIT: Thanks to those who mentioned the ableist undertones here. I admit that I foolishly blamed just a bad relationship situation as if all poly people are similar. That's not what i intended

Now I've got a full time job I'm happy with, and hopefully I'll be moving out on my own before the year's end. Problem is I can't ignore my sexuality any more. Came to terms with my bisexuality a while ago, and now I'm finding myself strongly drawn to a nonmonogamous lifestyle. Either something polyamorous or something with a nonmonogamous couple. It's what I really want, but I feel that the deck is stacked against me.

Frankly put, I passed out of respect for her (if she couldn't enjoy it, I couldn't). Things were sexual, but penetration never occurred. I feel my inexperience with men isn't going to cause me nearly as much trouble. I also feel the fact that I'm a single male is going to be a big issue for me too.

Other than that, I'm communicative, honest, open, pro-active. I've dropped 65 lbs (and counting), I'm polite, respectful, and I'm actually pretty well versed in a lot of issues surrounding sexuality (my non-throwaway account participates in a number of subreddits on sexuality and sex positivity. Just because I'm not having sex doesn't mean I shouldn't know about it).

I suppose **here's my question: is it worth it for me, or Adult Friend Finder**, or am I better off bumming around Craigslist (where I've gotten a few people who were interested, but randomly stop answering messages just when it seems we're hitting it off). I'm not totally against the idea of spending the money, but I don't want to spend on a service that will end up being totally useless for me. Or are there better things I should be doing? I'm not really interested in romance right now, I just want to let me inner ethical slut out, for once in my life. I have the time, I'm out

We swing (meaning we sleep with other couples


I should premise this by giving a little more background: when we were first together, like, multiple times a day and couldn't keep our hands off each other. After moving in together, an abortion, my stress being unemployed for almost a year, and the general wearing off of the honeymoon period, we settled in at about 2-3 times a week. When we have it, but not as great, he's not. The swinging complicates things, think that it's normal to be excited by others


Essentially


Which brings me to our most recent encounter... I sexted with the male half for a couple days before we met up with them, etc. It was super hot, and made our meeting even hotter. Built up anticipation, etc. etc.


When we met them, see him again by himself...I didn't even really want to have sex with my SO anymore, just this other guy. I felt so guilty about it that I burst into tears when I was having sex with my SO, and broke down and told him everything.


To clarify, and therefore not appropriate-- we are supposed to meet people, have sex with them, and that's it. If we text, it should be for logistical reasons. Anything else can be said in person, when we are all together.


It's now been 4 days since we met this other couple. I still can't stop thinking about the guy (I had very strong chemistry with him), he's honest, he's open, he's so patient with me, he's always there for me...but I'm afraid that I'm not happy. If I were, why would I be thinking about this other guy so much, even when we're having sex? Why do I feel so desperate for his attention and want to keep sexting him?


I know that our relationship has lost its spark, and I worry that if I'm not happy, I'm wasting the time of someone who frankly deserves much better. 

I guess I am looking for reassurance that what I'm feeling is normal

TL;DR - Ummm

Ok, or physical appearance problems at all.

Well, since she didn't have the phone.  Well I found out it was sexual discussion with a co-worker that I'd never met.

No need to get into direct details of what they did or when.  Long story short

After discussing it with her…  I found out that she was unhappy with the relationship for several reasons that I did not realize.  We are high school sweethearts.  I was always loyal, she has had every boyfriend before me cheat on her (all in high school).  She always told me that if I ever wanted to be with another girl to simply tell her first and leave her.  She always said that she could never understand how someone could cheat on someone else and be ok with it.  Well, now that she became a cheater… She still isn’t ok with it.  She apologizes all the time, she is seeing a psychologist.  She isn’t in a good place right now emotionally.

She says that nothing in the relationship is my fault.  I tell her that half of the fault is in fact my own.  I was always really possessive and I’d worry about things like her shirt exposing too much cleavage and ask her in a pretty harsh way to change clothes and stuff.  Back then (many years ago)

Well, I didn’t recognize an issue in this form of controlling possessive behavior.  A huge mistake.

So 12 years go by and I think we are both extremely happy (before I read that text I mentioned).  She has always had a view that marriage is a bad idea.  Everyone in her family is either divorced or lives together with children and no marriage.  She views marriage as an SO’s way of tying a partner down and then acting the way they always wanted to before...  As if people act different to lure someone into marriage

Well, she has only recently been able to show me that her being bi does not mean she wants a boyfriend AND girlfriend at the same time.  Merely that she is open to a monogamous relationship with either gender.  Well, me being an idiot, I never recognized this.  I used to always give not so subtle hints that MFF threesomes would be fun.  She even liked the idea for a time.  We never did it.  Neither of us complained that we never did it though.

Ok, respect for strangers, charity and courtesy that I’d dare compare her to Mother Teresa before what she did to me.  She feels terrible for what she did.  We still discuss the situation all the time.  I’m trying to get over it 100% because I recognize my fault in the situation as well as hers.  I want to help her get better too.  I know that only then will we both be able to consider how the relationship will progress from there.  She is far from better though.

I wanted to come here because I find that if she and I are both agreeing that I am normal for looking at girls and whatever…. Well

I have been able to completely get over her cheating on me.  I managed to do that by feeling relief from personally being able to blame myself partially for her life leading to this outcome.  I recognize how terribly possessive and controlling I used to be.  I will never ask her to do anything like that again.  I’ve told her all this.  She just says it is her fault for not speaking up and letting it happen.  I prefer blaming myself for ever asking in the first place, sure… But I feel it wouldn’t have ever been possible without me being such a terrible SO to her.

Part of the way I got over what she did includes learning about non-monogamy.  I am not saying that being NM or Poly is at all equal to cheating.  Honesty is the cornerstone of poly and I get that.  However

She has not been speaking to him for 2 months.  She knew it was wrong to be behind my back and ended it for me.  However, I’m afraid I immediately give her the impression that I’m ok with it because maybe I always did want to be with other girls too.

The truth is; I’m still hurt a little bit if I see her use her phone.  Remember

So you are probably wondering why I’m saying all this.  Well… I just want to know how the rest of you got started.  Were you born knowing you would never be monogamous?  Did you start with monogamy and have it end badly and then come to this?  I am curious if some people are only NM/poly out of the fear of being cheated on.  You can’t be cheated on if you consented to multiple partners and you think you’ve met all of your SO’s partners
I’m not saying that I’m even sure I’m NM/poly/open.  I think there is a chance that I might be.  However

She later found out that the guy she was cheating on me with had lied to her.  He told her he was divorced for 2 years.  He is still married.  The wife found out about her and called her.  He didn’t have the balls to fess up.  My girlfriend isn’t the first girl he’s been with behind his wife’s back.  She knew of 7 others.  So my girlfriend is dealing with the pain of breaking her cardinal rule (don’t cheat and lie) as well as being duped by the exact type of guy she always feared I would be to her.  I feel so fucking bad for her that I don’t have any pain of my own over what happened.  She has yet to feel stable enough to have the conversation with him to tell him how angry she is.  I got jealous when I saw her on her phone skyping him last night.  She even pointed the phone cam at me and I couldn’t even speak looking face to face with the guy.  I didn’t know what to say.

I know that I can heal emotionally and move on to any future.  I’d be happy to continue having a monogamous relationship with her.  I enjoy our time together no matter what.  If she decides that she needs to stop dating me as well as cut him off then I understand.  She isn’t sure she can stay with me because I remind her of how bad of a person she was for cheating.  She isn’t sure if maybe she needs to walk away from the whole thing and not even have a relationship to heal.

Thanks to reading about NM/poly for the last 5 days, made her feel like a whore and she wants to help him.  I could never claim to be so considerate.  I admire her for that strength.

So… How have you all started realizing that you were NM/poly/swingers/open/etc?  Are you with a partner now that you were once monogamous with?  Did you both become NM together?  I want to hear both the good and the bad stories.

Mainly

Does it sound like I may actually be poly?  Feel free to ask questions about anything.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I had to talk about it with someone and I feel like this is the best place.

So that is the general background.  The specifics:

2 yrs ago - 
We discuss opening our relationship.  She approaches me because she is feeling the desire to be with a woman strongly (until this point she had only lightly experimented with girls when she was younger).  She lays the situation out as something for her to explore that side of her and me be the supportive by-stander having no involvement.  My feelings were hurt, and she is more involved than me with the interactions.  This slowly builds a lot of jealousy in me, and I eventually attempt to contact someone without her knowledge.  She finds out, things spiral, we stop looking.

I spent the next 8 months to a year building her trust again.  About a year ago, I tried contacting someone outside of her knowledge. She found out, replay spiraling and fighting, etc.

About 3 months ago we were back to the point where both of us were comfortable resuming the search.  Coincidentally, but she quickly let on that she wanted to fuck me.  I resisted, and told this girl that my girlfriend and I were looking for a threesome and that I could talk to my girlfriend about that possibly being her.  (I know... really fucking stupid.)  My girlfriend reluctantly agreed, and we began dating this girl.  With my girlfriend having almost all of the interaction with her, conversations and dates.  It wasn't long before I felt left out again, and contacted this girl without my girlfriend's knowledge (which was against the boundaries).  Soon I was fucking this girl behind my girlfriend's back, and the girl and I were lying our asses off to my girlfriend to cover our tracks.  4/20 all three went out with the intention of 'sealing the deal' so to speak.  Problem is that my girlfriend got way too drunk, girlfriend catches on.  My world is ready to fucking cave in again.

The following 5-6 weeks are hard for me to own up to... but I'm going to anyways.

After crushing my amazing girlfriend multiple times I finally start doing a lot of soul searching, and seeing a personal therapist regularly.  I have made a ton of progress.  And my relationship with my girlfriend, and everyone else, including myself is so much better.

Two weeks ago, since I dangled it in front of her with this other girl, and then promptly fucked it all up.  I am reluctant, but agree that she deserves the opportunity, I just ask that we give it a little more time until I am on more stable ground in my recovery.

Last week, and my familiarity with being deceitful started calling a lot of attention to some of her actions.

To sum it up quickly, one I knew of that she had said she met from Girlfriend Social and was 'harmless.'  The other I didn't know of... who wasn't harmless.  It is a woman that she is interested in. And they had been flirting back and forth for a while.  Anyways, I stumbled onto the evidence of her deceit and lies... essentially turning the tables from the usual way things turned out.

We have spent the last 5 or 6 days discussing this at length.  And I am wanting to be supportive of her and this opportunity.  At the end of the day I know that we both love each other unconditionally.  Neither one of us ever wants to lose the other person.  So we have started talking about boundaries that will keep our relationship healthy and positive above all else.

Problem is I'm hurt. I'm jealous. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  I don't know if it is possible for someone with a sex addiction to maintain the type of lifestyle we are interested in.  My therapist and I have talked at length about the differences between healthy and unhealthy sex behaviors for an addict.  I am starting to come to terms with the difference between not using sex to cope with negative feelings

Sorry for the long post. 

We have been dating for almost one year, but felt this aspectof the relationship might help me grow as a person. I read a lot, thought a lot, and struggled a lot before deciding I wanted to go for it. I was still slightly unsure but went against my hesitation. We have been together since last September, without any other partners or FWB for either of us. Our relationship has been, by default, exclusive for the last 11 months or so. Not once was actively opening up our relationship discussed or even hinted at

He finally brought up the fact that he needed to sleep with other people in early June. I took it really hard and it was really difficult to work through, possibly leading to sex, a few times a month, with different people. After working out restrictions, I finally agreed this week to give it a try, and he is hanging out with someone from okcupid for the first time this Friday while I am at work. I feel extremely conflicted - I am happy for him that he is getting what he needs, yet still overwhelmed with jealousy and frustration. I want this Friday to pass but I also want it to never happen.

I really love him and understand his need for others but can't seem to be comfortable in this situation. I don't know whether to break it off with him or carry on through the jealousy. I got myself into a difficult situation and now I need help.

Thanks for reading.

tl;dr - Got into an open relationship without actually wanting to be in one. Almost a year later he wants to sleep with other people and I am super conflicted.

I felt suddenly inadequate, not interesting enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, my booty was too small.  He suggested I read Ethical Slut, but once I got over the pride and got into the book, I felt like there was a lot of possibilities for emotional and personality growth that was intriguing and tantalizing.  

Last night

The emotions went like this: I had spent the day hanging out with him and his roommate, amazing woman who easily fit under my green gaze after he had made a compliment about her to me a few months past.  I was deep in the jealousy soup for a while.  But then we hung out, we talked, we got cheese together and things were O.K., I started to connect to her and she wasn't terrifying anymore.  I was so happy that I wasn't feeling jealous of her anymore, so happy that i could feel compassion for her and for him and his feelings again.  Swept up in that and the haze, I wanted nothing more than to accept more change into my life.  Even if it was scary and felt horrible for so long

If you are in an open or otherwise off-the-escalator relationship:

2. How ""out"" are you about your nonstandard relationships -- in what ways, etc. (Or: how are you closeted?)

4. How do your choices about outing/closeting affect your relationships

5. What kinds of experiences have you had with either stigma or acceptance related to your choices about outness?

6. What questions do you have about people's choices to be out (or not) about their nonstandard relationships?

So, take it slow. Maybe years down the road I'll understand better and won't get knots in my stomach and crushing anxiety at the thought of her by herself with someone else pleasuring her the way I do.

So my husband and I have been married for two years and non monogamous for the entire time (with varying success) and I can't seem to get over my jealousy issues.    
    
First of all, I actually like his aggression about it - it's just that I end up with an annoying nagging feeling that I'm not enough or that he doesn't want me anymore. I know neither of these is true, but I can't shake the feeling. Am I insane? He says that he can't imagine feeling one thing and thinking another~ And it isn't about trust; I don't even kind of think he would cheat on me. I think my worst fear would be that after years of trying to make it work he might sometime realize he isn't satisfied and talk to me about it and that I would realize that I couldn't do any better than I already was...but even that is a useless thought, because it hasn't happened, I have no signs of that happening and it will likely never happen. So why waste my time worrying about it?   
    
My other frustration, it isn't his fault that I don't try to pursue more guys.

We had two children and as with any couple it was a very rough time for us. The children demanded all my time and energy and I neglected him. I didn't want sex as much and what was once a very strong physical bond was severely affected. I always told him I owed him one but I ever thought in a million years he would cheat on me. But he did. Not only did he cheat but at one point he even conned me into having a threesome w them in the middle of their affair. I though she was a girl he had met that he had a ""crush"" on from work so we invited her over but little dd I know this was a plan they had already hashed out together. But there was a horrible undercurrent in my gut afterward and I told him it would never happen again. Little did I know that the two one of them already had an ongoing relationship. Two months ago he  ended a 15 month affair and he was very close to leaving me. At first he said the only way he would stay is if I allowed an open marriage for him to be with her as well as me. I said no and we are still together. But here is my biggest problem. He now says he believes in polyamory and I do not. He says he has had this belief for longer than he has been w her.

In the last 6 months or so I've been feeling extra lonely. I work about 40 miles from where I live and my jobs don't often last for more than 9 months at a stretch so finding friends at work doesn't pan out. I've gotten into social activities but my wife isn't interested in joining me for either of my favorites. 

I was introduced to the idea of Polyamory via a friend and everything about it felt right. Sex with other people was obviously something interesting to me and I certainly could use the extra intimacy. Before talking to my wife about it I picked up The Ethical Slut. When the book came in I told her what it was and that I wanted to read it through before talking to her about it. I wanted to make sure I knew what I wanted before I asked my wife for anything. I finished it and told my wife my ""perfect world"" scenario would be to have one or two women that I might see once a month for a date+ night. I thought that would be fair to our schedules and reassure her that I wasn't just trying to find my next wife.

We talked about it and after multiple discussions

She loves me = true
I love her = True
We enjoy Sex = true
I say sex =/= Love
She says Sex = Love
I say ""But Swinging is sex without love""
I say ""you want to date couples aka love them""

We have very open lines of communication and discuss everything, I learned how to manage my anxiety and anger by talking about what is bothering me at the moment when it is bothering me

For example, time and time again, ""I want the vasectomy, I am going to get the vasectomy."" Months went by, no appointment. We talked about it, and when I mentioned that he hadn't made any move on the vasectomy and that I wanted to get my tubes tied he didn't want to hear anything about me getting my tubes tied, he called and made an appointment right away, I offered to get tubal again

Another example that has been more recently problematic is of a sexual nature (and why I'm posting in /r/poly ) is that we started talking about non-monogamy (specifically swinging) about a year and a half ago. He was super enthusiastic about it at first. We started to meet couples online, and as I do more reading on the subject, I get exposed to more new ideas. I was 27 (at the time) and really starting to feel connected to my sexuality for the first time. Truthfully, I've always loved feeling/being slutty. I guess I've just always had ethical conflicts with it. Being introduced to polyamory and non-monogamy opened my mind and my eyes to a whole new world of relationship potential. 

I delved deeper into atypical sex. I discovered my submissive side. I discovered, feeling like I was making sense of myself for the first time. I told him I needed and wanted these things sexually. He was unsure how to make me feel submissive sexually, so I shared some links with him about things I found particularly sexy. He didn't read them. I asked if he would spend a little time looking into it himself and see what he likes/would like to do to me so I didn't feel like I had to coach him through us venturing into bdsm style sex. I would ask him to spank me while he was fucking me from behind, but it always felt more like masturbation. Like telling someone exactly, word for word, what you want done. During all this, I started to feel more sexual than ever. I wanted sex all the time. I'm not going to mince words, and I realize that is my problem and not his, and I almost always initiated it. I told him over and over again how much it would mean to me to have him initiate sex with me once in a while, said he'd try harder

Finally, and of course it felt good, but afterwards I was really worried, and we ran out and got Plan B so I wouldn't get pregnant. He also pulled my hair so hard during this session that my scalp was rather swollen. If he was going to be that aggressive, it would have been much better in the form of spankings. Anyway, of course Plan B failed, and I got pregnant. We already have two kids, emotionally, the sex, step-by-step

Post-abortion, and I break down crying. I tell him how hard I'm struggling with some issues in my family (my mom and siblings) and how I'm feeling affected by the abortion, even though I feel I made the right choice. I tell him I need to drop two of my classes because I'm going to fail them. He says he may need to drop some but he's unsure at this point. I beg him to drop my classes for me because I can't ... because I just literally can't do it. I feel sooo bad about failing the classes, and dropping them, and it really isn't what I want but I can't deal with the failure. He hugs me and assures me he understands and he'll take care of it. (You have to call in, and he is able to drop my classes for me. It's a small school.) This last Friday, I ask him for the third time if he's dropped the classes. He says no but that he'll take care of it right away. I log into my classes to find that it is now too late for one of my classes to be dropped

These are the biggest and most recent examples of our on-going problem, and says he'll put some thought into it. Again, he says he'll read about it later, talk about it with me later, and at this point I just don't feel like I can take him seriously when he says he will do something. In the meantime, he's thinking about it and I am getting no feedback. He has made one demeaning comment to me about my desire to be poly. As time goes on, I feel worse and worse (neglected and depressed) about our situation and like he again, really want it. I think I may need it. But I don't think he's listening to me. 


 I just don't know what to do. Am I being too hard on him? I know I can be hard on him, he can count on me. If he asks me for something, I do it. If he needs me in a moment of weakness to do something that he cannot, I'll do it. If I tell him I will do something for him, I do it. I feel like this isn't reciprocated. I'm not asking for an open relationship because I feel like things are unfair, but I am asking for an open relationship AND I think our relationship is unbalanced, especially as of late. He is good to me and our kids, about anything, I am just trying to make sense of this and discern whether or not I've been fair to him. Any feedback would be appreciated. 

tl;dr-- Married woman who is extremely direct with her spouse. Time and time again, making me feel more neglected and depressed. Am I being too hard on him? Any idea what I should do? 

Anything helpful or even just uplifting or funny to share with me? I could use a laugh.

I've been to a few events (meet-ups, etc.), but so far between that, and online research, we haven't really been able to find people of similar age, interests, and taste. Honestly, but we're having trouble finding the kind of people that we're attracted to

We're both younger (20s) and more geared towards artsy-fartsy, tattoos and punk and indie-rock type shit. I feel like our kind of community, or at least like-minded people have to be somewhere out there, it's fucking New York, after all.

I was meeting up with a guy in an open relationship for 1 on 1 sex. His husband thought it would be a good idea to start a drunken orgy to spice things up. So yeah it went horribly wrong. It traumatized me because I was (and still) recovering from PTSD

He explained to me that it was a one time thing for him and that he doesn't really have sex with anyone else, he is close friends with one of the people I saw him have sex with. They are pretty open sexually. He even took pictures of his friends naked. (Pics showed up on a gay dating site.) Although he doesn't have sex with them, I get the impression that they are pretty open with each other sexually. He is comfortable enough to buy him sex toys and fetish gear. It's hard to not get jealous, or even depressed because of what happened. I'm almost exactly the opposite. I don't bring up sex at all. I wouldn't dare ask my friend to buy me sex objects. I have never asked my friend to take sex pictures of me or any other friends. I don't bring up sex. I don't want to interfere with their relationship at all because I feel it is not my business. 

My jealousy is pretty deep seated and extended way beyond the physical aspects of our friendship. The close friends that I associate with the orgy and sexuality go with him to gay pride parades every summer. I live in a small town. I would kill to be somewhere where I didn't feel like people were going to beat me to death for being who I am. It's full of rednecks here. The friends who I saw my friend have sex with

I don't expose myself his friends and husband anymore because of the stress. Put a stop to that a few months after it happened. I was an idiot

I can't visit my friend at his house

 His husband was extremely disrespectful to me because he would also brag about going to these gay pride events. He told me about a lot of his sexual encounters, and told me a lot of their sexual encounters. The husband told me that he has sex with the close friend a lot.  I was reliving emotional trauma about what happened everytime he did this, which was almost everytime I visited. I cried my fucking eyes out when I went home and went into shock each time so I didn't know how to deal with it sometimes I didn't even remember what happened.  I kept exposing myself to this because I was a lonely fucking idiot who was in shock. I can't articulate a reason for my own stupidity really. I put a stop to that about 2 years ago or a few months after it happened. I didn't understand it gave me PTSD at that time.

Fast forward to 2 years later. I talk to the guy literally everyday for as long as we want. He actually is a nice sweet guy. He has put up with a lot of my anger. We can talk literally for hours and hours. He can tell me about anything and I can tell him about anything. He would do a lot for me. Since I've been sick he has helped me do a lot of things around the house. I don't visit him at his home due to the trauma


I found out the guy was actually still in contact with one of the other guys who were involved with the orgy.. I didn't deal with that very well. It feels like he kept him secret from me. I know that I don't have the right to know what goes on in this guys life

I don't even know how to express my paranoia. 

 It almost feels like we're in a relationship in the sense that I talk to him everyday, but he omitted details. Details about people I saw him have sex with that traumatized me. I thought this guy was just a random stranger that they never meet before. But it turns out all this time I have had 3  guys instead of 2 to try to not severely jealous over? It's too much.

I'm sorry if that didn't make much sense or if I'm rambling. I am very emotional and I am trying to vent. I'm sorry if any of my replies are emotionally violatile. Putting this much information causes a great deal of vulnerability and defensiveness sometimes. I feel like I don't need people to tell me it's none of my business,,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,True

My bf and I have a straight, I had to break it off shortly after because she didn't really respect the boundaries I set with us and with my bf. 
 The whole story can be read here: http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1dv9jv/my_first_experience_gone_terribly_wrong/

After thinking about it for many months, going on picnics with wine at the park, bringing sex toys in the bedroom, taking showers together. When I think back, I also realize that I shouldn't have tried to calm down her insecurity about our fling by saying that she shouldn't worry, that I wouldn't abandon her like the other girls in her past. 

I really meant well, and to pretend to not be dating him at our graduation ceremony, because she told her parents(who met me when I slept over at her place) that we were seeing each other. I felt like she wouldn't be able to share me like we had agreed to in the beginning.

Unfortunately, and when I said yes, she went cold and stopped texting me(My bf was always informed of all of this, and he consented that I met her if it meant I could get some closure). I know that she might rightfully still be angry at me, and that I shouldn't have broken the no-contact rule, but it still hurts that we will never be able to be friends again. It all sucks even more because I have to go to this event on Monday, and I just found out that she will be there too

ANYWAYS my point is, how can I give my bf the girlfriend he deserves? How can I ever try to get involved with another girl, and satisfy my bisexual side if I can't even be careful with how I treat others? I can't help but feel greedy and selfish every time I consider getting involved with another woman again..:(.

Thanks for reading!

TLDR: I can't get closure for my first fling in my open relationship. Feeling guilty for having been the one to break it off after leading my fling on and not delivering. Also feeling guilty because her memory is interfering with my long-term relationship.

How do I initiate this as there is a few problems.,FuckingSecrets,1,2,1,"**tl;dr : I (18f) want to have sex with the head chef (Scott, even if it's to drop it/forget about him because I'm so young.**

Problems: 

I'm usually shy and nervous

He's shorter than me by a few cm (I'm about 5'7""-5""8). I don't mind

I'm so much younger than him.

I don't have a lot of confidence in myself.

I don't know if he's in a relationship himself

Would he be okay with the whole ""I have a partner at home"" thing?

I'm going crazy

My partner is very okay with this, and the last few nights I've been telling him about how Scott and I would fuck, how often, where, how I'd make him listen, other times make him watch. He cums more than usual when I tell these types of stories. His first relationship was also a lot like this. He would be happy having sex once a month, yet I would be happy with once a day, especially with someone I'm so highly attracted to.

The situation is that I'm doing a one year course at a polytechnic, where Scott mostly works. I had an opportunity to work in the actual bar last night for two hours. This will be going on for the next few weeks, but it may be different people from my course doing it. No pay, but good working experience, as I don't have any. 

What happened yesterday was I went to inform the manager that I'd be the only one working that night as the other girl was sick. Scott was standing at the bar with the manager, while Scott was doing some work about 3-4 meters away. We didn't talk that much, since I like to work in silence, but I really couldn't keep my eyes off of him. I don't think he noticed. I then spent the rest of the time there serving people and taking food out/in. We shared a few comments and smiled at each other. At the end, when I was leaving, he came out of the kitchen with the manager and his boss, and I thought pay back was in order, but I was nervous and excited. The manager of the restaurant is also only allowed to hire students

If you read that article and liked it

**Please [take this survey] (http://solopoly.net/2013/01/13/survey-for-our-book-how-are-your-relationships-off-the-escalator/)**

I'm working on a book tentatively titled: **Off the escalator: great relationships that don't follow society's rules.** This survey gathers people's stories

This book will of course cover polyamory and other approaches to honest, friends-with-benefits, indefinite dating, and more. 

The point is to show that people who are willing to step off society's relationship escalator have a wide array of options that can be equally ""serious, their partners and families, for their communities, and for society at large.

Also, it doesn't work for everyone, and it's never anyone's sole option for ""real"" or ""good"" relationships.

I welcome anyone who can be supportive and civil. I especially know we need to form a larger community with the local LGBT
I hope that people can find support a little closer to home than may be provided in the other polyamory/non-monogamy subreddits which I love well.

First and foremost, so if you read this sunshine, thank you :)

My wife was concerned when I started chatting online with a young woman. I have to say, and not very forthcoming. Plus there are all the societal pressures of an older man creeping on a sweet, innocent girl … what if people found out I was *taking advantage* of an intelligent consenting adult who happened to be young. I understand it could have been a very bad situation, but she sounded so interesting and she kept hinting that she found me really attractive. And no offense to the teenagers of the world, she didn't sound overly dramatic. It took some doing, but we finally set a date to meet and I couldn't have been happier with the results.

Yes we had sex later in the evening, and very inexperienced. She's not innocent by any stretch, but damn it felt good to hear, feel, and see her mind being blown by every touch. I've been with multiple women, I'm very competent, but holy hell… I've never felt like such a sexual god in my entire life.

That's fine, developing the relationship should come first.  

Unfortunately

This is what I do

Start by having sex with a woman relatively quickly (4-10 hours total elapsed time and 3 dates max.) in order to engage the woman's emotional reasoning rather than her logical reasoning. If it takes longer than that, and never put the pressure on her to settle down or develop the relationship in any way.  

Paradoxically, and doesn't create any pressure for her to settle down?  
She'll be trying to rope you into a relationship before you know it.
