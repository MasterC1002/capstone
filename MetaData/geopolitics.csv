There are too many forces clashing with its new role as regional commodities bully besides demographics.  The explosion in natural gas production will likely dismantle Russia's hold on Europe.  Less dependence on middle eastern oil will mean that the US can focus on containing Russia.  Even China seems poised to make inroads into Central Asia.  How will Putin react?

Only with its air force and navy

One reason for this is because the US military budget is absolutely indecent. They have this unmatched military arsenal because they have been paying for it

Granted the USA would find it impossible to invade and occupy large and powerful nations such as Russia or China, if nuclear weapons are put aside, the USA could paralyze and submit any nation using air and naval forces. 

If we add the element of alliances

And finally taking into account the fact that resources are being fought over as never before and will eventually come short

So in resume

- The USofA is the only Super Power left.
- The USofA's military force is overwhelmingly powerful
- The USofA has internal political and economical problem linked to the funding and use of its army
- The USofA's army is a huge part of its economy and foreign relations
- Other nations are building up
- Fewer resources are being fought by more customers
- Other nations may eventually feel confident enough to challenge the USofA into a ""real"" war.
- USofA may eventually be unable or unwilling to fund and maintain this army
- Taking Nuclear weapons into account but assuming no country would dare pull the trigger
- Taking also US alliances in account

The question :

When is it foreseeable to think that a military power or alliance could even dare take the US and its allies in a direct war and

/u/ImChrisHansenn were able to accomplish by some research yesterday. Every story contains real world events that have actually happened with actual whistleblowers and governments around the world. As a geopolicical subreddit how do you view these stories and situations compared with current situations happening around the world right now with people like Assange, and others.


My post follows below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's all an act of aggression against everyone involved. They are just testing the water to see what they are capable of getting away with.

You want a spy movie read? Check this out. It's all from real world events.
If you piece together all the Wikipedia articles about Litvinenko, Asassinated journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the Stratfor Hack which ties multinational corporations to Private Intelligence Corporations, Global Intelligence, Private Security Contractors, Money Laundering to hide the trail of the decision makers, their relations to Wikileaks, and Snowden's current situation of being a whistle blower....

Everything starts to get crazy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko#Russian_apartment_bombings
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Stratfor_email_leak

&gt;WikiLeaks founder **Julian Assange told Reuters that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.""[24]

&gt;Al Akhbar, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar Assad in Syria. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition from his Stratfor briefers.[17]

&gt;An email involving **a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house.**[11]

&gt;emails reveal that Stratfor had been partnering with Shea Morenz, in order to profit from what could be considered insider trading. Stratfor planned to use the intelligence it gathered in order to profit from trading in several worldwide markets.** They created an offshore ""share structure"" known as ""StratCap"" during 2011, in order to avoid insider trading allegations.

Also worth checking out is Russian President Vladimir Putins role in Gazprom the largest natural gas comapany in Europe and one of the largest corporations in the world. 

Here is the type of organization Putin made Gazprom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_champions

&gt;National champion is a political concept in which large corporations in strategic sectors are expected not only to seek profit but also to ""advance the interests of the nation.” This policy has been popular and practiced by many countries.

Next is worth checking out Putin's networth. (Dick Cheney

Review everything above with past CIA/NSA scandals from the United States at home and abroad and you can see just how fucked up and interwoven everything and everyone in power really is.

As well as *whistleblowers from the World Bank* of which almost every nation is a member. They help move the secretive money around and launder it all.

another one - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-lawton/world-bank-whistleblower_b_3350872.html

http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2012/0716/feature-world-bank-robert-zoellick-too-big-to-fail.html

Internal reports, for example, that even after Zoellick implemented a budget freeze some officials operated an off-budget system that defies cost control, while **others used revolving doors to game the system to make fortunes for themselves or enhance their positions within the bank.** Why not track all the cash? 

Good luck: Bank sources cite up to $2 billion that may have gone unaccounted for recently amid computer glitches.

Sadly, **is so obsessed with reputational risk that it reflexively covers up anything that could appear negative, rather than address it. Whistle-blower witch hunts (see box, p. 92) undermine the one sure way to root out problems at a Washington headquarters dominated by fearful** yes-men and yes-women, who–wary of a quick expulsion back to their own countries– rarely offer their true opinions.

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmintdev/writev/402/contents.htm

The UK Serious Fraud Office also called the Securities and Exchange Commission to inquire into the World Bank’s accounting irregularities. Hudes reported to UK Parliament that the SEC stonewalled the Serious Fraud Office.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit - Just to note since my comment will probably have a lot of responses I would like you to remember the links posted and their stories and also think about how it's all just so unbelievable that these situations are happening.

*And have been for a while. It just goes to show how much distraction there is and how much pressure is put onto whistleblowers to keep information like these stories from having staying power in the mainstream media.*

Imagine if these were the types of stories the press reported on instead of the stories we get from them now.

I've been scouring the internet to find a single website that covers geopolitical/geostrategic issues in depth. So far I've found the following:

* [StratRisks] (http://stratrisks.com/)

* [Stratfor] (http://www.stratfor.com/)

* [The Geostrat] (https://thegeostrat.com/)

The last one only offers paid content (at very steep prices!). The first two are ok but don't update fast enough.

He was a U.S. navy flag officer and arguably one of the most important strategists of his time. In 1890 he released his book: ""The influence of sea power upon history"" where he stated that greater naval power leads to greater worldwide impact. This idea got a warm reception in the dominant powers of the time: Great Britain (until then the world's dominant force), U.S.A. and Germany (the main contenders to take over the position of world leader) and Japan (the upcoming military power in the far east) started an arms race for the greatest navy. Mahan's idea's were mainly based on previous phases of global war where Great Britain had defeated dominant powers such as France and The Netherlands because of greater naval strength.

**Rules:**

•Agents cannot act freely

•Agents act within structures

•Structures limit

•Structures also facilitate agents

•An agent can also be a structure and vice versa.

**Structure:**

•A structure is a set of rules (form as in legally enforceable laws) and norms (culturally accepted practices) that partially determine what can and cannot

•In this sense

Agents:

•Agents are those entities attempting to act.

•In other words

      o	Another view

•The self-same country may be seen as an agent operating within the structure of the international state system with its international laws and diplomatic customs.


**Conclusion:**

•This framework shows that agents are given both opportunities to act but also constraints to their possible actions given the structures they operate within.

•Second, a number of structures simultaneously, given the multiplicity of spheres they operate within.

•Third

•Fourth, within a hierarchy of geographic scale.

•Finally

**What's the purpose of this framework?**

Is it merely to show that all Geopolitical *agents* (be it an individual, and that these agents will themselves become *structures*?

What is the application within the world?

Thanks for any help.

Quote:
&gt;The call is the latest sign of deteriorating ties between Tehran and Baku and follows a March 30 conference in Baku organized by groups seeking independence for Iran’s sizable Azeri minority

&gt;Speakers at the conference, and predicted that the northwestern provinces -- which they referred to as ""Southern Azerbaijan"" -- will ""inevitably"" become independent.

&gt;Reports say the conference, academics, and former Azerbaijani officials. Current Azerbaijani government officials were reportedly not present at the conference.

&gt;A participant was quoted as saying by the Turan news agency that ""If the Iranian government loses control

&gt; Azeri separatists,"" suggesting they need to be liberated from Iran.


The region mentioned as ""Southern-Azerbaijan"" is of great geopolitical importance because it is located directly next to the Caspian Sea and is Iran's main gateway to that sea. The Caspian sea is of importance because of the natural resources it contains such as oil.

For further reading about the importance of the Caspian Sea

Quote from the abstract:
&gt;The Caspian Sea is one of the most important source of world’s energy resources, which has led to serious disputes among the littoral states over the question of energy exploitation and distribution. Politically, as well as economically, certain regional and international powers are trying to expand their sphere of influence in Central Asia and Caucasus and a strong rivalry is emerging among these powers for the control and exploitation of the energy resources, termed by some scholars as the New Great Game.

Important quote from the last article:
&gt;Economic growth in Azerbaijan is met with fear by officials in Iran. With the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in place, it is doubtful that this cooperation will ever develop to the point where it takes on a strategic element. This is in part due to the growing influence of outside players, particularly Western states who wish to control energy resources in the area and block any and all Iranian attempts to exert their influence.
