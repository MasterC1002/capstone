1372587927.0,1hcy1p,Was in GW for 5 Hours Yesterday - Observations,Bennyandthejetz1,100,16,146,"Swung by Games Workshop yesterday to watch some WH40k battles &amp; made a observation that needs to be brought up.  I really hope someone from GW sees this.

In 5 hours there were roughly 16-18 customers

Of those 16-18 customers **""1""** purchased something.  Every other customer had the exact same reaction.  The moment they saw the pricing they were IMMEDIATELY turned off &amp; walked out of the store politely but will never return again.

The GW owner did a fantastic job.  He helped new customers paint a miniature

Here is my concern.  You are literally turning away a massive portion of potential sales as a result of your overpriced products.  If you were to make your products more affordable

I'm having a hard time believing that GW is better off making 1 sale &amp; turning away 90% of its potential customers than making their products a little more affordable &amp; getting more players into the game.

This decision doesn't just effect you GW.  It effects the entire mini wargaming community.  I've found it increasing difficult to find players to play with.  Lots of independent retailers that carried GW products have stopped doing business with you as result of the new trade agreement which has compounded the issue further.

To top it all off, The Toughest Girls of the Galaxy, Malifaux...you name it.

I'm not sure who is managing the business at Games Workshop

I know you are all eager to get into an AMA. The mods from /r/warhammer40k were nice enough to reach out so I think it's more than logical to have our first AMA in /r/warhammer40k.

I know you all have very strong opinions

We will be streaming on twitch.tv in addition to the AMA in case some questions are a little too tricky to answer by keyboard. It's up to you if you wish to put some structure in the AMA or just let it run free.

The top 5 bests questions / comments or suggestions will have a reward. The process will be entirely up to the mood of our team. 

We are planning the AMA this week or early next week. Tomorrow I will send you the exact time. We were thinking of splitting the AMA into two parts

Hello readers of /r/warhammer40k! We've received a couple complaints about meme posts in mod mail

The options I've already come up with are as follows:

1. Remove meme posts altogether

2. Remove meme posts after they receive a certain number of reports

3. Allow meme posts but only allow 2 on the first 50 posts at a time. This'd essentially mean they can be here

4. Just allow meme posts

Let me know what you all think. I'd like to implore you all to not to downvote on other's comments if you disagree

When I was just starting to play warhammer because I made friends with a couple of guys at my high school and I was fortunate to have a GW store in my hometown, was preaching to me about the glories of the space marines and saying all of these things that made the space marines seem invincible. Barry was a nice guy and all, but he was very quick to anger, and nothing made him angrier than losing at warhammer; I learned this the hard way. Fast forward 2 months, I've realized that the space marines, despite all of their glorious invinible and testosterone enducing manliness, weren't to my liking. I had created a 1500 point army of my beloved Tyranids specifically designed to rip apart space marines and chew the power armoured panties to pieces. However, and can recite almost all the rules for each unit because my friend Barry had told me to read the codex religiously (I don't know if he was being funny or serious with the book being about relic and glory hugging high gothic ninnies) and I took him very literally so I did. We exchanged lists without much problem and he gave me a smile as he whipped out his army cases, and demolishers as well as numerouws rhino's come onto the board.

There's always been a lot of criticism about the way GW currently does business. With this in mind I thought I would go to the source.

I intend to write a letter to GW with a series of questions in the hopes that they will respond

The idea is that any response they give will be posted for all to see on various forums (any recommendations also welcome) and will be unedited by myself so that the word is straight from them

Equally, when a space marine assault squad, consisting of 5 models is also (roughly) £20"" Is a good one. I believe they are more likely to answer this question and take the letter as a whole seriously if it is worded in this way.

I have been a casual player for about 20 years and the staff i've encountered have been friendly

This list focuses on the hobby aspect of WH40K and not the gaming aspect.

First rule and hard truth: Games Workshop products are usually the most expensive and almost never the best quality.  Of course they make what I think are the highest quality miniatures out there.  For literally every other product associated with this hobby

Vallejo – Paint

Reaper - Paint

Privateer Press - Paint

Army Painter – Variety of modeling supplies and paints.

GF9 – Variety of modeling supplies and tools (my favorite glue and green stuff)


Art store brushes are usually higher quality and cost less than brushes you buy at game stores.  Natural hair lasts longer than synthetic.  Brushes for watercolors work best for our purpose.


If you’re on a budget, can be stripped and repainted.  Soak in Castrol Super Clean overnight, then use a toothbrush and watch the paint peel away.  For god’s sake though; wear gloves when doing it.

**Modeling and painting tips for beginners**

* ALWAYS prime your models.  Trust me

* Add a couple drops of water to paint to make it apply easier and smoother.


* Add a little bit of soap (I find windshield washer solution works best) to your water cup.  It makes cleaning brushes easier.  It also helps break surface tension

* Use blu-tack or similar product to hold models to empty paint pots while painting.  This allows you to paint without your fingers touching the model.

* Gluing sand to a base and drybrushing it will always look better than flock.  Art stores sell sand textured gels if you don’t like working with actual sand.

* Super glue accelerator exists and is awesome.  Sometimes it's more effective to use super glue and accelerator to fill gaps than using green stuff.

* In a pinch

* Used sprues have many uses.  Cut up pieces to make debris for basing.  Carve used sprues into tools for working with green stuff.  Cut a long piece and glue it to the bottom of a base before priming the model

* Pinning is easy to learn and makes building metal figures way easier.  Cheap paper clips work just as well as the expensive pinning wire you can buy at the game or hobby shop.

* Sheets of cork board can be broken up to create realistic rocks for basing.

* You can wrap thin wire around a slightly thicker wire for a nice looking barbed wire for basing.

* Painting Space Marine backpacks separately

* Vallejo and Tamiya make metallizers.  They are basically the metal flakes that are in metallic paints minus the pigment.  They can be added to any paint to make it a metallic version of that color.

* Learn to take care of your brushes and they will take care of you.  Clean thoroughly every time you paint and lick your fingertips to shape the brush back into shape for storage.  Brushes should last for years if you take good care of them.

* When brushes eventually break down and lose their tip or get misshapen, etc.)

* Wash and dry your models before priming.  Sometimes models still have lubricant on them from casting or molding.  This can make the primer not stick to some parts. - *Thanks to* **MisterMeatball** 

* 2 or 3 thin coats of paint take less time than stripping a goobered up model and repainting it. And it looks better. Way better. -*Thanks to* **MisterMeatball** 

* Use a palette. A palette can be anything, runny consistency. If you think 'milk' when mixing, you'll end up in the right place. -*thanks to* **Charlie-Green-Rug**

* Give your army variety.  Don't make every guy look the same

* Work on 2 or 3 models at a time.  I find it more convenient to move on to another model instead of just sitting around waiting for my washes to dry.

Please help me add to this list!  I definitely wouldn’t claim to know everything and I’d love to learn more.

**Murrdox** *asked me to put some priming tips up
**Priming should always be done with care

* Avoid brush-on primer.  Spraying is really the only way to get a thin and even coat.  Even if you’re too young to buy spray paint

* Always protect the area you’re spraying.  Some use newspaper


* Don’t breath in the fumes

* If it’s super humid or rainy

* Ideal distance to hold the spray can is 1.5 to 2 feet away.  Start spraying the air

* When done spraying

1364060139.0,1av8s0,Thoughts on Tyranids and the Warp,donaldosaurus,52,7,39,"One of the reasons that I love the background to Warhammer 40K is the fusion of dark fantasy (daemons, but fun nonetheless.

In that spirit I came up with some thoughts regarding the warp and specifically how it related to Tyranids. The warp is explained as something that is generated and formed by conscious thought. Presumably then it can only exist in any meaningful way where there is sentient life. Life can only exist in large numbers in galaxies, but the spaces between galaxies are big enough that they’d probably be isolated).

As a sentient species (or at least, or strengthen existing ones. The Eldar were all but destroyed when their unchecked hedonistic excess reached critical mass and created the warp entity Slaanesh. Mankind seem to be heading in a similar direction, albeit by strengthening existing gods (possibly because humanity is a more diverse race in terms of emotions and desire compared to the Eldar). Perhaps it is the natural life-cycle of an intelligent species to manifest psychic powers, colonise the majority of their host galaxy, and then in time be wiped out by the warp entities they spawn, leaving clear the stage for a later species to repeat the cycle. The universe is home to 400 billion or so galaxies (that we know of), which conjures the image of a void clustered with little islands of life

It is hinted at in the fluff that the Tyranids invading the Milky Way are fleeing something even worse lurking out in the void. The Tyranids evolved or were created in another galaxy and are predisposed to consume, it’s not difficult to imagine them expanding beyond the ability of their creators to control. Areas they strip of life would not be able to support their voracious appetites and their numbers would diminish. Areas that were given the chance to replenish would eventually be consumed once more in a never ending cycle of feeding.

This Tyranid hunger is never sated, the species that had destroyed their creators with their unchecked hunger would now face a similar fate. Hunger-daemons would invade their realspace and consume trillions, and whole constellations would be pulled into the warp to be feasted on. The survivors would instinctively realise they had to flee, but there would be nowhere in their galaxy safe from the god they had unwittingly created. Their only choice was to abandon their galaxy and strike out into the void.

Denied the use of warp travel through the quiescent gaps between galaxies, and find it teeming with life. The vanguard Tyranid forces are awakened from their slumber, ready to initiate another galaxy-wide holocaust, before they are once again forced to move on. 

There’s probably a lot wrong with this theory, furious that it had no more life to feast on, casting its eyes across the stars to track down the last morsel that escaped its grasp.

One guy stands and starts laughing, shooting down some robed dudes. Adept is trying to find a guy we think is important. Laughy looks at me, says, ""I wonder how your brains taste...""

I love my Warhammer 40k books

I have been looking out for an Ork book for a few years now and have not come across one. Mind you my search has not gone far beyond a couple of book stores in my local area and a cursory glance over the Black library site. 

The only real writing I have seen on Orks was in the Dawn of War games and the Warhammer MMO  in both of which I loved the Orks for their whimsical nature.

PS: Does anyone else notice that book stores seem to have a hard time to keep all the Warhammer books in one section? Maybr thats just  local thing though.

Wraithbone is a plastic building material that is formed out of the Warp (an essentially endless resource) and used for building everything the Eldar use

One application of this material is to create robots like the Wraithguard. These robots are powered by the souls of dead Eldar, but that doesn't really make much sense.

Instead of a warrior, so they can (eventually) produce a limitless supply of war machines. Even if they can't make anything too fancy, eventually you've made enough missiles or whatever to just drown your enemies in psychic plastic.

It's a major thematic point that the Imperium is losing the technology war because they don't understand science and their factories keep getting nuked by Orks. The Eldar have the potentially for limitless production capabilities because there are a lot of dead Eldar and an infinite supply of Warp to turn into Wraithbone.

But then I also don't understand how the Necrons haven't killed anything for much the same reason. They don't sleep


Although I suppose the actual reason is that if any one race ever 'won' there wouldn't be much of a game to play...",self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1f8h8w/so_im_kind_of_new_to_wh40k_but_i_dont_think_i/

I just found this awesome custom map for a game called AtWar.
It's a free2play online multiplayer turn based strategy game. It's described as a mix of risk and civilization. You conquer cities and countries (in this case planets and sectors), move them freely across the map (unlike in Risk where you move them in territories), make alliances with other players...
Up to 20 players can play on one map and a single game lasts about 1h

So if you ever wanted to wage a galactic war in Warhammer 40k universe here is your chance.

I'll comment first on the physical book. As a lover of all things bound, you need to experience it. It's sublime. 

The pages are a thick stock, and the overall printing quality is pretty much flawless. They also properly bound the book in a pamphlet style so the book will lay flat and stay open to whatever page you've turned to - a huge bonus for us gamers. The inclusion of a cloth bookmark is just another example of the quality and attention to detail they put in to the whole production. To top it off, the corners of the covers are bound in foil embossed with the Imperial Eagle, and the pages are edged with silver.

Onto the content. 

To put it plainly - this book is an old-schooler's wet dream. I've been playing 40k in some capacity since Rogue Trader (my mom bought it for me for my 13th birthday) but it wasn't until 2nd edition that I really started to delve into the lore and backstory of the setting. And as a Chaos player, scrounging for every new detail about the Heresy and its participants. 

If only I'd had access to this book back then. 

Given that this is the first book in what they promise will be a series, army lists and stats for all of the key forces including several primarchs (Horus included!), information about the Titan Legions, pre-heresy vehicles and weapons technology, and - to top it off - they've included several of the characters from the novels (Loken!). They also made sure there's no shortage of scenarios and campaign rules to keep hobbyists very very busy for a long time to come. 

It's pretty clear that the people at Forgeworld who were involved in the making of this book are definitely fans of the material. It's been presented with such reverence and polish that it's hard to find any fault with the whole product. The only thing I can really come up with is the price. Once you ship it from the UK and pay the duty,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,t3_11ifs3
1349930922.0,11amfs,Primarch Battle Royale,1UnitOfPost,26,2,78,"Scenario: all the Primarchs are brought together for a last man standing free-for-all. This is pre-heresy (so no ascended daemon Lorgar or possessed/favoured Horus)

The arena is say a largish island with most biomes present: a mountainous edge with snowy upper regions, fresh water rivers and surrounded by beaches and ocean. It should have a mix of abandoned urban locations, including light, medium, and dense (maybe a smallish hive ruin).

So far I'm about 8 missions in, sometimes 5 shots from my Storm Bolters into a single Genestealer just to still fail to kill it and watch as it tears my Termie's face off. 

While the above could just be bad luck, while the helmet-less Sergeant's have faces who look like they came out of Oblivion's beta or something. They look AWFUL, and the Termies often do things like shoot down the wrong hallway while overwatching and still hit Genestealers no bullets touched or sometimes they just glitch up and shoot into the air for no reason. Another big issue is in the menus. The menus can often get buggy and overlap each other in terribly clustered ways that prevent you from navigating them. Its a glaring oversight and you can really tell the developers didn't do much to try and polish the game. To top it all off, theres also very mediocre voice-acting from the Lexicanum before each mission; his voice often shifting wildly as if the VA lost track of what kind of character he was trying to portray 5 words into every sentence.

If anything, i definitely recommend waiting till it drops 50% during a steam sale or something. Surely don't pay over 20 for it. Honestly though, even that's probably way too much for this mess.

But wait! There's more. Instead of explaining it outright, Hiss.*). These guys follow a very rigid chapter structure. Luckily for us, each type of company that makes up the standard chapter just got it's own *""Apocalypse Formation""* and therefore it's own one click collection. Pips. So:

* One *1^st Company Veterans*. **£663.50**
* One *Space Marine Reserve Company (Tactical)*. **£356.70**
* One *Space Marine Reserve Company (Assault)*. **£539.50**
* One *Space Marine Reserve Company (Devastator)*. **£448.00**
* One *Scout Company*. **£324.00**
* Five *Space Marine Battle Company*. **5x412= £2060.00**

For a grand total of **£4391.70**. *Jeez*.

A quick rundown of the models that contains; 400 Tactical Marines, 50 Scouts, 50 Sniper Scouts, 25 Terminators, 25 CC Terminators, 25 Vanguard, 25 Sternguard, 9 Commanders, 8 Iron Dreadnoughts

Now let's say I wanted to do a standard chapter setup. *Using MkIV Marines*.

Let's get our 400 Tacs. £1840.00. Oh wait

200 Assaults. These guys have weapons, Instead we'll get 50 with powerfists and storm bolters for **£450.00**. To get are MkIV vets we have to be Red Scorpions, and it starts to get interesting. Our Vanguard come in fives, and come with some plastic parts, but I'm going to replace those plastic parts with MkIV resin parts, so we take five of these and five more sets of five assaults for **£300.00** . The Sternguard not only come in tens, with a commander too

Anywhoot - she showed me these God of War styled swords that she had made as a necklace for somebody and it struck me that there may be a desire for some custom crafted bits for 40k and perhaps Fantasy and other Wargames as well.

I have a few questions for more experienced space marine players out there.

* Do you put your tac squads in rhinos/razorbacks or let them walk? I have had mixed results with this. I lean more towards getting the rhino because it is pretty cheap, and often none at all. You might be slowed by having to move out of the crater, but surely thats better than having our expensive troops readily exposed to shooting nastiness. I can't really figure out why rhinos have ""gone out of style"". But, maybe thats why I can't make my marines win.

* Is it just me or are assault squads bad? I like the models, so I feel like assault squads should be a no brainer. In practice though, they almost always let me down. They get shot to ribbons if I deep strike them, and if I just run them up the board they are either blasted to uselessness or savvy opponents screen them from ever reaching the back field with something that just eats them. I readily admit that I have failed in my attempts to make assault squads a contributing part of my list. How do you guys use them? 

* What is your strategy/game plan with vanilla marines

* What is the unit you never leave home without?

* (edit) has anyone tried Shrike and a ten man assault squad infiltrating? In my head this would work beautifully,False,self,t5_2rr81,1350436432.0,,,t3_11ky09

so a friend and I picked up Dark Vengeance a few weeks ago
**A balanced army can do well against a balanced army, etc).**  While there are counters available, I don't see how a balanced army could field enough missile launchers with flakk (or meltas and lascannons) to possibly cope with such a niche army. This subreddit has a lot of ""Your army does well against army type X, but not so much against army type Y.  Fix that.""  But after the ""fix"", the army no longer does quite *as* well vs X, although it does do *better* vs Y.  So would I have to collect enough models to field specific counters?  Or simply hope that I never play against a niche army?  Thanks.

I also got some better pics of the first ones I made since the lighting was a little bad and the images was a bit blurry.

I also want tips on how to paint them.
So far I have thought about having them almost clean white with a little whiteish green and some purple-gray base,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,t3_1dc301

So after searching the internet for immortal magnetizing methods for a while but not being able to finding any I like

And I am pretty happy with how it turned out

I used 1x1 mm (.04x.04 inch) neodymium magnets
The one in the arm is sticking out half way and goes into the hand. This combined with the way the right arm naturally fits into the body (no magnet needed here) makes it possible to pick them up from the weapon and even shake them around without the body flying off. 

I hope this may be helpful to someone.",self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bom6m/magnetized_immortal_weapons/

1376305526.0,1k77yn,My Alternative Heresy - Sanguinius the Betrayer,NinjaPenguin2k7,28,10,36,"------------------------------ Sanguinius the Betrayer ------------------------------------------------------

After a very hungover Sunday reading the amazing Dornian heresy and other alternate heresies, however Abbadon's Imperial decree allowed the original legions to retain larger numbers.

My alternate heresy will consist of fan-fluff, and perhaps even some miniatures. I hope to develop the story behind this in the future, and get it to the level of Dornian heresy or even further!

So first of all

----------------------------------------- Traitor ------------------------------------------------------

Blood Angels: The legion of Sanginius, champion of Chaos. There are several different elite formations within the blood angels dedicated to different gods, from the Khornate Death Company to the Slaaneshi Sanguinary Guard. Known to form large Blood Crusades, and wield daemons and cult marines of all forms in battle. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ultramarines: Their celebrated and elite status eventually lead to arrogance, and in their pursuit to become as celebrated and elite as possible, devoted their souls and bodies to the dark prince.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Salamanders: The diseased, replacing it with fields of waste and decay. The Salamanders always cared for their mortal inferiors far more than other Astartes, however this gentle care evolved to a suffocating embrace which saw desire to see their friends and subjects live forever, even as poxed zombies...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White Scars: Their once white armour now stained a permanent red, and years of battle in the great crusade only reawakened their bloodlust. This rediscovered bloodlust attracted the lord of blood, Khorne, and the rest is history..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iron Hands: Formerly a legion of technical might, and methods for using science and arcane magic to predict the future. However, this 'machine god' of knowledge and machinery turned out to be Tzeentch, The Lord of Change. Now, utilising twisted and unreal mixtures of daemon and flesh, as well as eldritch magics seen to them as 'programming', the blue-turqouise Iron Hands march to battle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Space Wolves: A legion of brutal, and march into battle with intent to destroy all. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imperial Fists: Undivided, and believed fracturing the Imperium into distant petty empires would starve the tyranids of large amounts of human genes. They still aim to divide the Imperium by destroying its many fortifications, and walling imperial cities in, often until air runs out. While their original intentions were pure, by the 41st millenium they have reached rather high levels of corruption in some warbands. The Khornate Crimson Fists are an example of this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raven Guard: Worshippers of Chaos Undivided who are low in number, chained in their ships but unleashed on the battlefield when needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dark Angels: The Dark Angels are a mysterious legion, also known to the Imperium as the Legion of the Damned. Little is known about the true intentions behind their cloaks of heretical markings, but what is known is that it is pure evil..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you just plonk the unit on he board and flame everything and then your opponent pretty much has to assault your unit and then you'll have 14d3 overwatch hits with half of them rerolling to wound and an initiative 5 commander farsight with 4 attacks and a S5 AP2 armourbane weapon.

The store had 6-3'x4' tables set up, 2 were more open with minimal terrain such as light ruins and vegetation, and the last 2 were more densely packed with low ruins and rubble. Which table and opponents you played was sort of by draw.

With my Tau I won 1 match and lost 3, Imperial Guard, and Tau. And even the matches I lost I felt pretty competitive with my troop choices up until the match time expired.

Personally

Basically, though you'd never really see much of them-- you might see an occasional flitting shadow, or see an Ork pulled into an air vent or something, but it would just serve to increase tension. Then all hell would break loose and it would turn into a massive Genestealer-v-Ork battle as you're trying to fight your way to a rescue ship.

As far as what the characters would be capable of, and the Space Marine would have the best hand-to-hand combat skill.

Having a bit of trouble determining what a zombie/monster behaviour table would look like so I thought I would share what I had with you guys with hopes that you could give me a few pointers? :)

Table of Contents

1.	Introduction
2.	The Game
3.	Characters
4.	Armoury
5.	Squads
6.	Missions
7.	Campaigns


1. Introduction

WHAT IS ZAS!?
Zombie Apocalypse Survival at its heart is a table top survival horror where you as a player take control of a single model and work as part of a team to carry out missions set in an apocalypse of undead proportions. You must set aside your differences and work as a team in order to meet these objectives

HOW DID IT COME TO THIS!?
You were sent to this world in order to quell an uprising/fight off an Ork invasion/purge Xenos/cleanse a Chaos Cult.
For the time being it does not really matter what you came here for (although we will explore this later)
Basically
You, and now whatever seemed important before suddenly takes a lower spot on your priorities. 
On the bright side
For the time being your main focus should be to put a fair distance between yourself and these poor souls
These terrible monsters are all for equal opportunities

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!?
At the very minimum you should work to try and stay alive. If we are thinking bigger then you should be hoping to either escape, the galaxy is a big place and one planet will not be missed, more likely is that a contingent of the Ordo Maleus will arrive to see to it that you do not make it out, as zombie planets do not contribute positively to the Imperium’s PR.

2. THE GAME!!!
Overview
There are two ways that ZAS can be played
If you are looking for a narrative experience and dramatic story then I would suggest you nominate a player to take the role of the games master
If you do not want to use a Games Master then do not worry as it only contributes to a narrative aspect
Phases
Not unlike 40k there are 3 phases to a turn, and Close combat (although it is not recommended to enter into close combat with a highly infectious abomination that is spilling various nasty fluids with every step).

The movement phase is carried out as normal, if you are climbing or have to make a jump to reach your destination. Your characters stats and abilities will play a big part in how mobile you can be. The movement phase can also be used to undertake certain actions so long as you do not move or move very little, such as opening a door, picking a lock, hacking a terminal etc.

The shooting phase also works like 40k.Rolls to hit are still the same
Factors such as your movement

It should also be noted that your characters ballistic skill will play just as large a part in how easy it is to wound your target

For example a guardsman with a BS of 3 will roll to hit and need a 4+ to make the successful shot. 
He rolls a 4!
Well done soldier
He rolls a 4! Close shave laddie it looks like you hurt it!
But oh no what is this!? 
The zombie rolls his armour save and makes it! 
Unaffected by your poor shooting! 
If only you had rolled a 5+ to hit! Then you would have hit the head and destroyed the brain
This works much like the rending rule as seen in the 40k main rulebook but it is the characters BS that depends on what they need to get that rending value
The shooting phase can also be used to undertake certain actions much like the movement phase.

THE COMBAT PHASE! Unless you are lucky enough to be in something equal to or better than power armour I would not recommend going into close combat by choice as zombies travel in packs and can easily overwhelm small groups of survivors.

If you do find yourself in CC with one of the monsters you can choose to try fight it and this would be done through conventional close combat rules. However it is recommended that you disengage from the melee especially if it seems like more baddies will be turning up. 
This is done by taking a “disengage test”.
If you are locked in combat with a single zombie you roll a dice
However if there is two of the beasties you will need to roll a 3+.
If there are 4-7 zombies are going to need a 4+
8-15 of the beasts and you are looking at a 5+ to get out of this one.
16 or more of the bastards and it’s a 6+ to successfully disengage.
This is to help represent the idea of all those dirty hands clutching at your characters limbs. Now it is understandable that some characters will find it easier than others to escape for example the agile elder or jump infantry (but if you have a jetpack what are you even still doing here?) These characters will have these traits mentioned in their profile with details of how they affect the disengage test.

Infection
If you roll a value equal to or under your toughness you are fine (bikes do NOT make you more capable of fighting off toxins). 
If you roll over your toughness value however then you are infected
As a member of the infected you keep all your stats and war gear but lose any ability to shoot/make actions such as open doors/ cast psychic powers or anything that requires a certain degree of intelligence. 
The abilities of infected players will be covered later in the characters section. 

3. CHARACTERS

The characters in ZAS use the same stats and abilities as those in 40k, which would require a strength test or hacking a computer which would require an initiative test.
A characters speciality will also lend to these types of actions
It would take hundreds of pages to list all possible characters specialities and how they could affect different actions

When you are building your character you will use your codex and take the points value from that

Please note

ZAS is a narrative experience and while it is cool to just brutalise your way through a bunch of poor zombies with all of your awesome gear and mad stats, while it is not something that I feel would be an issue with most gaming groups for the sake of prudence I must stress that it is a character’s flaws what make them interesting, not how easily they can wreck a horde of zombies. If it has always been your dream to be Kaldor Driago then by all means play him in ZAS but just remember that you are not the only one playing and a game where a one man daemon prince spanking, garden of Nurgle burning, warp walking machine will be a very dull for someone else who might be a single imperial guardsman. When making your character don’t be an asshole.
That said having a single space marine helping a group of guardsmen reach evacuation is not something entirely out of the question at all. For the sake of the narrative just exercise a degree of restraint. 

Normal humans such as Imperial guard will not receive any bonuses to their stat line when making certain tests

Augmented humans such as tech priests or members of the mechanicus will receive +1 bonuses to their Initiative and toughness when making a test to see if they can access terminals or machinery or if they need to make a toughness test (this +1 is not added to their toughness when the monster is rolling to wound
Depending on their augmentations there may also be a +1 to their strength when making a test to see if they can break a door down or move an obstacle

Astartes both loyal and renegade have +2 to their strength and toughness for action tests due to their enhanced strength (further enhanced by their armour) and their ability to break down toxins within their body. It will always take a roll of 6 to infect a space marine.
A Tech-marine will also receive the same bonuses to their rolls as members of the mechanicus.
If a space marine is infected and bites another player
An infected space marine cannot be rended when rolling to wound like mentioned earlier in the shooting phase
When in CC with an infected space marine there is also a negative modifier to the characters disengage test by negative one. This is due to their increased strength. (Disregard this rule when infected space marine is in CC with an Eldar player)

Eldar (dark elder included) all rend on a roll of 4+ due in part to their excellent marksmanship

Orks are only infected on a roll of 6+

Tau receive a +1 to all initiative tests.
