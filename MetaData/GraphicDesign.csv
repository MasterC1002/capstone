1350097679.0,11ee4a,As promised - Rules of thumb: Designing for print,netbich,51,10,17,"As I stated in my original post


**File Format:**  Most art is sent to us electronically via email or through one of the file sharing sites. We get the occasional CD or flash drive. If you are emailing your file please do not name it “business card” or “CD cover” or whatever it is. You are not their only customer. We get hundreds of files a day and they all go to the same place until we get ready to set up your file. It sucks to have to sift through 20 files named “business card” and there’s a chance the wrong file may get used. Most places will give you an invoice number when you place the order.  Use that as the beginning of the file name or at least try to give it a unique name such as “yourname_business_card” 


 We accept and prefer high resolution TIF’S, EPS and AI files.  
We also accept native files such as InDesign or Quark (oh

 

We do NOT accept Word documents

**“High resolution”** is considered 300 dpi at 100 % scale. If you send us a 2 inch logo and want it blown up to 10 inches your resolution drops to 60 dpi and will print like shit.  Vector files don’t have resolution issues and can be scaled to whatever you want. We love them. If you don’t know the difference between raster and vector
Also
Always create your stuff at 300 dpi and at the final size of the product you are ordering. 
This being said


**Layout:** Create your document at the final size you want it to be PLUS bleed.  If you don’t know what bleed is
In other words

**Keep critical art elements at least .25 away from the edge of the die line** ( the die line is where your product will be cut ) This includes text


**Fonts:** Fonts are the bane of my existence… Either they send a file that is missing fonts or they want us to add text using the same font that is in their logo (which is a flat Photoshop image or in curves.) Contrary to popular belief we cannot immediately identify every single font we see. Although after all these years I’m pretty good at it.  

There are some web sites that help identify fonts. 

http://www.identifont.com/  

and 

http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ are two really good ones.


But just because we know what font it is doesn’t mean we have it available for use. 
When we tell people their file is missing fonts and/or images they get annoyed. “What are you talking about? I don’t get a missing font/image message when I open it!” Yeah
The best way to insure your fonts print exactly as you created them is to convert them to curves or outlines. This is an Illustrator feature. The downside to this is that we cannot make any text changes for you once they are converted to curves.  Photoshop does not generally give us font problems unless you want us to change your text. 


**PROOF YOUR OWN FILE** before sending it out so no changes will be needed. I’m shocked how many people apparently don’t know their phone numbers or web addresses. 
Spell check


**Color:** All printers print in CMYK or spot colors (generally Pantone spot colors) Spot colors usually cost extra but you are more or less guaranteed to get the color you want. 
If you’re more comfortable designing in RGB feel free. But make sure you convert it to CMYK before you send it to us so you can see how it will really look. There are certain colors that simply cannot be printed using CMYK. That super bright blue and green you see on your monitor does not exist in 4 color process land. Unless you want to pay extra for Hexachrome inks and even those aren’t as bright. 
The RGB blues usually turn purple when converted and red gradients turn ugly brown.  Personally I would design it in CMYK from the start. But even doing this
Blacks and ink levels: I’ve recently started seeing an annoying trend. People are using registration as black in their art. (100% of all 4 colors – cyan, such as muddy colors or ink puddling. Total ink density needs to be capped at 290%.  You can see what your ink totals are in Photoshop under the info tab
**Most printers have a “rich black” formula they prefer. Ask yours what they use. We use 45-35-35-100**



**Most of all have realistic expectations.** You can have the exact same file printed on different mediums (paper
I’ve also uploaded an [Art check list](http://i.imgur.com/wPjnG.jpg) we use for the TL;DR version of this post. I removed any company info if you’re wondering what the blank spaces are. We don’t print for the general public. 
I hope this was helpful. I probably forgot some things. Feel free to add to it.  If you have any print-related questions feel free to pm me. 

**EDIT** I knew I would forget some stuff... 

 Another common issue is people will send in black and white art and ask for a ""Forest Green"" or ""Sky Blue"" background with white imprint. These are not real colors in the print industry.  If you can't afford a pantone book

* Never ever believe that you've made it. No matter how good you get you should always strive to be better because chances are there will always be someone better then you out there.
* Learn the tools of the trade really really well and I don't just mean photoshop. Illustrator and Indesign are mostly used for the foundation of any design work. Shortcuts will make your life easier!
* Don't take criticism and critique immaturely. They could be wrong they could be right
* Surround yourself with good design
* When pricing a client like a friend or some kind of simple task especially if you're still in school or just out of school don't expect to make 1, because what's important right now is building your skill and portfolio.
* The most important experience you could ever have is a good internship if at all possible before you head out into the field for a job.
* Take inspiration
* Read books
* Design isn't easy because it's very detail oriented despite what most people think.
* You don't have to go to school to become a great designer. There are millions of books and online tutorials to check out.
* Just because you're talented doesn't mean you're skilled. That takes time and effort. Don't get by on just talent.
* Understand color and color theory.
* You will eventually become obsessed with typography
* Design does not mean color and type or how things are laid out. Design means to plan or to solve a problem. Always start your design process with sketches and brainstorming before you even touch the computer.
* Nobody will hire you if you're lazy and have an arrogant attitude about your work even if you have the best work out of everyone who's applied. They'll pick the guy behind you because his attitude is awesome and can mold well with the team.
* Print design is awesome
* Always spark creativity by doing art in other mediums like painting, photography etc. 
* Sometimes the best effects are done by hand and not digitally. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.
* Hang out with other friends who are designers to get feedback and share ideas. Your work will improve and you'll inspire each other.
* Last but not least

Thanks

Earlier today I was visiting a nursing home and as I walked down one of the corridors I saw a lot of notes/papers. Some handwritten and the rest of them typed out with Comic Sans. At first I cringed a bit

I think most people would agree that Comic Sans is inherently a pretty bad font

So what's my point? Is Comic Sans a decent font? Is its use in a serious setting justified? Was it correct for this context (the nursing home)? No. But what I remember thinking was how the silly

So I thought I would post those thoughts here. Because it struck me that perhaps sometimes bad design can actually be good design. When perfection isn't achieved but humanity slips through the cracks and the perfect but apathetic face of bureaucracy fades away to show something much uglier but also much more true and beautiful.

So for the sake of discussing this topic: When do you think bad design

My issues:

* AI's default when resizing an object is not proportional. You need to shift+click to scale proportionally. How often do you really want to stretch and distort versus resize proportionally? Wouldn't it make more sense for the default to be proportional scaling?
* Many features (Blob Brush
* There is, you may have to click Ungroup many, many times to separate all the elements.
* The alignment tools are hopelessly clumsy. Want to align one object to another? Okay: Click object one. Shift+click object two. Click object two to make it the Key Object. Open the Alignment panel and click the appropriate alignment option. Why bother with Key Objects? Many other programs make alignment much simple by having the first object clicked automatically be the ""key object""
* The Pathfinder tools are mind-bogglingly frustrating. If you, the compound path will be released and then grouped. Why not leave it as a compound path?
* You're able to Lock objects

1360712721.0,18eqrj,Looking to launch a weekly youtube series on design.,they0da,8,0,8,"Hey all fellow designers. As the title states

As I see it now, fun, and easy to understand design education videos. This is where I'd like to make my entry.

I'm currently a sophomore enrolled in Visual Communication Design but have been designing in total for about 5 years now (damn I feel old saying that). Because of this I have a nice mix of self taught and disciplined design principles flowing through my work. Like most of you, and I did things MY way. Getting to college however proved to be a lot different than I imagined. Once I got into some higher level courses, I dealt with a ton of criticism, so much so that it felt like design bootcamp. For many of us this was a complete shock. When I was a freshman, my entire class consisted of about 200 people. Now, as a Sophomore, that's down to about 100.

My reasoning for creating these videos is to ease the transition between going from a completely self taught designer to becoming a formally educated designer. In my videos, design principles (this would probably take about 5-10 vids to explain of it), tutorials with adobe programs like photoshop and illustrator, and I would definitely like to showcase other designer's work! 

So my question to the graphic designers of reddit. Would you have any interest in this? As of now

**EDIT:** From all the feedback, I'm willing to help. Thanks for the response everyone!

The idea is to have a graphic signifier that could be used individually and also used together with the name of the company - **skycycle studios**

I wanted to have a story behind the visual that is not in-your-face obvious. 

The circle defines the visual and represents the **sky**. The inner shape is an ""S"" on its side but the shape can also be perceived as infinity representing the **cycle** part.

The broken cycle and contrast between 90 degree angles and a full circle is an intentional conflict to give it a reference to the dramatic subject which is **sky** and **space**   

And last but not least

I still haven't properly thought out the wording of rationale but these are the initial thoughts. I kind of like what I've got but I'm not completely convinced if I've cracked it. 

Any thoughts are very welcome. Thanks!

1.) Is a flat rate fee a good idea? I was thinking of limiting the number of concepts and revisions in order to just charge a flat rate fee to make it easier.

2.) How do you handle showing clients works in progress in that haven't been fully paid for yet? I don't want to just give them full access to the files and hope they don't run off. Limit the size of the files? Use a watermark?

I am currently a journalism and international studies double major. Being involved with a school newspaper for the past four years, and Illustrator. I won several state and national awards for layout design, and grew to love the process of creating. I'm an amateur photographer as well.

Layout examples: http://imgur.com/a/UCa2s#3

(My school newspaper in high school was called ""The Talon."" These are just a couple examples of what I happened to have on me at the time.)

But here's the problem. On paper, sculpt or anything. I am definitely a creative left brainer, but my outlet of choice is usually writing. I struggle with stick figures . . . that's how bad I am.

That brings me to where I am today. I really do love journalism

Here's where you lovely people come in. I have zero graphic design mentors

1) Is knowing how to draw essential to the vocation of Graphic Design? I'm not a visual artist in any other area

2) Is a minor sufficient

3) What's the job market like right now? I'm sure it's better than journalism

I tried to keep it concise. Sorry for being the annoying freshman looking for advice

I've done some work here and there for a little cash on the side.

There's a ton of technical jargon on the poster

Also I'm not sure table 1 is really clear

The ELI5 version of what the poster is about is: The virus that causes the flu has a mechanism to inject itself into your cells and make you sick.  That mechanism is called the ""fusogenic transition of hemagglutinin"".  Hemagglutinin is a protein (abbreviated HA), (H3) and tried to mutate it so that it would also bind to different type, H10.  However, this was complicated by the fact that we didn't know the three dimensional structure of the H10 sequence, so we had to determine that by a method called ""homology modeling"" first.  Once we had the three dimensional structure, we could compare that to the known structure of the H3 that is known to bind to the antibody.  By doing that, then we knew exactly which parts (""residues"") of the antibody protein we would need to change to make it bind to our H10.  Once we made the changes, we made a lot of changes to the antibody

This is all awesome because these people actually want to PAY me to do something I enjoy doing in my spare time. My problem is that I have no idea what's a reasonable amount for which to ask. I asked a friend of mine who does GD work in Austin how much he charges for stuff like this and he said his lower end is $500-600.

Furthermore the Avery logo on the back of the vinyl is somehow bleeding through or being imprinted onto the front of the vinyl.

     - Different print profiles (GCVP, PGVR).
     - Scaled up the print to full size in case printing a smaller size was      the problem.
     - rolling out a couple of feet of the vinyl and printing in case the edge had somehow become ruined.

I am contemplating trying to write dirty novels for Amazon Kindle.   There is, but am thinking, it can't be that hard to write (I've done other wriitng) and they may as well pay me.   
.  
That said, who can make a sexy cover to my specs.   This will probably involve buying the use of a a stock photo from somewhere on a royalty-free basis.   Naturally, I would be paying for that, or if you prefer, you could roll it in as an expense, but while I might be okay picking through a small selection, I am hoping my designer would be able to steer me to the right one.  
.  
You're not expected to read whatever I can come up with.   I'd provide the title
.  
I don't expect this work should take a great deal of time.  It doesn't have to be immaculate (quite the contrary), but I am hesitant to do so without first discussing the work, the time-frame and what I can expect to pay for the use of a photograph.

Here is a recent article on Amazon's recommendations for the covers: http://kevinomclaughlin.com/2012/04/17/amazon-updates-kdp-ebook-cover-recommendations/  (links to more specific details here: https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A2J0TRG6OPX0VM)

* The particle effect that I added to the sprites that are just about to blow up are washing out the sprite. I'm going to need to play around with that a little more.

Or is it possible to buy your own stamp making machine? (Unlikely

Here are a couple examples of what I'm talking about:

I'm looking to get a monitor that is relatively color accurate and was leaning toward this one:

Asus PA246Q  - 98%(Adobe RGB), 1073.7M (10bit) Colors.
It's an IPS monitor with a 10-bit panel.  It covers a lot more of the color gamut than your average monitor.

Now here's the problem:  I recently learned that OSX does not yet support 10 bits per channel output

1)  I would like to get some information on how this 8bit signal will affect the color range

2)  I am questioning whether buying a cheaper alternative, E-IPS 8bit panel, is a  more reasonable purchase considering the 8bit output limitation on my mac.

I have been really getting into creative tiling since I started it one year ago and have recently found the perfect tool to cut tiles really precisely.

So now I have been working on a design that could really be a masterpiece of art that I will actually get to install in a sauna for a friend when it is done. If you check out this link to imgur: http://imgur.com/a/QAmVk you'll see this dragon I've made a while ago(and so you know what I am trying to do exactly) and the design that's in progress for the next one. My friend really liked my dragon that I've done that's how come he wants one for his sauna and I had the idea to incorporate one within a yin-yang sign, if you think you can improve it.. Also because it is so important for me, I have to be honest and say that even with all the scales correct, I am not to happy with my design overall. Thats why I also would like to ask if anybody could come up with a better design? please take into consideration I want the whole piece to be about 30-50 tile pieces perfectly balanced on a yin yang(excluding the scales, I am going to carve them in not cut them individually). I am going to use 3-4 colors of floor tiles only and polished black &amp; white granite for the orbs. I know this is quite the story/question but if there are any graphic designers out there with some time &amp; interest I would gladly transfer say $50 (only if I will use your design) and my extreme gratitude. and of course a few photo's of your design when it is installed in stone in a sauna.
I hope it makes sense

Needless to say I was ecstatic. 

I come in once a week to design a weekly newsletter

My job so far has been great and I've had no complaints from any of the higher ups but it has certainly come to my attention that they respond better to *flashy* advertisements and newsletters rather than what I've also done which is minimalistic. 

It is completely against my instincts to attempt to great designs that look like those ads that you see on the side of websites.

I'm wondering how good of a field graphic design is to get into right now. It seems like in this economic climate nothing is a ""good"" field right now

Also just from browsing this subreddit it seems unpaid graphic design work is becoming a problem? Can people expand on this? How much is it really hurting business? Is there a chance this will only get worse with time?

Basically my story is I'm a rising senior in college at a top 25 university in the US. Next year I'll be graduating with a degree in both English and History. I was one of the ""study what you love"" kids but with graduation nearing I'm thinking more and more about the job market. Right now I've been marketing myself mainly around my writing ability- with my majors I've had plenty of practice and I'm fairly good at it. However

I actually have an ""okay"" amount of experience in art. I've always been interested in it (thought about going to art school for a bit in high school) and I did a lot of work in ceramic sculpture and drawing. I'm fairly good at being able to look at something and copy it accurately (I can post some examples of my photo-realism work if people want), but it has been a good seven years since then so I've forgotten a lot. 

Sorry for the rambling

What are some resources for complete beginners? I would like to relearn Photoshop as well as teach myself Illustrator. I've browsed some other posts and have collected a couple design blogs to look at, the elements of design, etc. from past art classes. 

At this point I'm not going to change my degree and start over. How important is actually having a Bachelor's **in** graphic design? Would going to a community college for it be a worth-wile investment?

Any other suggestions for a complete beginner? Also once again sorry for the wordiness!",,t5_2qrct,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicDesign/comments/1fmhx1/questions_about_the_field_and_advice_for_a/

The problem that I need help on is this: I'm considering going back to school next year for graphic design. There is a program at a college near me called ""Art &amp; Design Fundamentals"" which as far as I know is something of an introductory course into the design world

Now, or am I going to be expected to already be an artist and I'll just have all sorts of assignments that I won't be able to complete due to my talent, or lack thereof?

1. Any free, Contrast, Saturation etc. Messing around with the color levels is probably the most desired feature that MS Paint doesn't have.

2. Any hints on typography? I'm planning on using [Credit Valley](http://www.dafont.com/credit-valley.font) (all caps) for the band name and venue name. No ideas on color schemes yet
3. I wanted the background to look something like [this](http://www.vectorfree.com/gold-paisley-pattern-vector)

Designers of Reddit - I run a charity start up based in Iowa, but we're offering something we think is better than a tax write off.) I signed up for sparked.com 10 days ago, they appear to be having an issue.

We're out to help kids. Poor kids, when no one else gives a crap.
(www.tot-mob.org[1] ) can be found here. The basic idea is crowdfunding
Kid wants to play football

They come to us with a need, we set up a project, and we and everyone else that we can convince that it's worth spreading the word about, help get it funded.
That's enough backstory - you can read how we started and what we're doing next on the website.

The font comes from losttype.com you don't have to use it

The colors - don't matter greatly. We're using a company kind of like zazzle to do the shirts to save us from having to put forward the money to set up

The shirt could include the url somewhere but not necessary, puns are awesome, cartoonish is awesome. Toys are awesome. Super heroes are awesome. (infringement isn't though.)
I've taken to calling the people that help us ""Mobbits"" Our next pseudo-fundraising event is a NERF gun war. (was today

Here's what we're offering - You design a shirt for us. Thinking 5 in total from different designers. For now. We'll see how cluttered it looks and go from there.

It goes into our store. We ""mark up"" the shirt at a total of $2. This store has pretty awesome book keeping so I know exactly what each shirt is doing, colors, etc. Here's where it gets nifty - We're only gonna keep one of those dollars. You tell us what awesome charity you want the other dollar to go to, and we send it out. (Just make sure they're in the U.S. please, we're not sure how nuts this is gonna get.)

But wait, website, wherever). It'll be considered ""on loan"" and if you want us to stop using it... Its a done deal. AND!!! We'll let people know where your dollar goes. I will work this out to get you as much backlinks/mentions/general good PR as possible, I'm a freaking champion for anyone that helps us. I have a basic understanding of how SEO works, and I'm not afraid to use it.

Couple things to remember - It involves kids

From the time I select the winner the designer has 5 days to send me the original files, well 5 days come and go so i decide to message the designer. After 3 days of no reply from the designer I decide to email the company, I tried one email on their website but it comes back as not a vallid email (Great!) eventually i find another email that works and send them an email about my predicament. Another week goes by so i decide to visit their facebook page and it is there where i see a handful of other paying customers having the same exact problem as me... So now i am in the middle of a dispute with paypal trying to get my $100. So i guess my question is if i show someone here the logo i picked is there anyway you could recreate?

The terms:

* I design 3 initial different concepts for you after you tell me what you want.

* Then you review them

* You get **unlimited** revisions for free (that means I will work until you are 100% satisfied with the result

* I work in Illustrator (vector) so your logo will be completely scaleable and printable. Also you get .AI / .EPS and .PNG and .JPG and .PSD (layered) of the final logo

* You pay **after** I design the perfect logo for you but before I send you the source files

* Payment methods: PayPal, or if you want to ask about something else - drop me a PM

The price range starts from 200$ for typical logo design work

I know that some of you are on a low budget and you are used to seeing designers work for $30 on some forums, the more you succeed in telling me what you want the better.

* Re-link all content in InDesign - basically making all new ads

* Unify body text and edit new text

* Re-design many of old ads so they are more attractive

* Align EVERYTHING properly

* Create new headers for sections

* Cover image - originally it was 200px x 100px or so

* Rearrange ads and text as I see fit


    


This project is something I lovingly call 'Landfill' - recycle a neglected project into something I am proud to present.  All I had was a hard copy and the old PDF file.  Thank God I had the PDF.  Many of the ads were done by the publisher or the publisher's son.  They had no problems whatsoever with me redoing practically everything.  



I used InDesign



If it were up to me, I am not a fan of Bevel and Emboss all over the place, but I did what I could.  



The print result was more incredible than I could have imagined.  Just the sharpness of the images alone impressed not just the publisher
