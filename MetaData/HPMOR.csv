this is non-canon in its explanation

&gt;""Not Harry, kill me instead!""

she offers the vow

&gt;Very well, ""I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.""

this is important, accepted the deal. even if lilly raised her wand to kill voldi, he still slayed her and fulfilled her role of death in the vow.  He basically stated, ""my killing you means harry will not die by my hand."" 

his sacrifice is the intent to kill harry, and by expansion that her and her husbands actions were meaningful, without which she would not fight. at this point he has entered into an unbreakable vow to not kill harry potter. harry was witness to this exchange (evidenced by his recall) fulfilling the the last prerequisite for the unbreakable vow, meaning that a small part of his magical ability is tied up in the vow, unless its breakage releases him. 

this is what saved him, it was the breaking of an unbreakable vow. in canon, that backlash means death. 

edit: cannon

Further Editing:

The only time we actually see evidence of the vow killing someone is if we accept the premise that some sort of vow was made between Lilly, admits that odd things happen around him when he is mad, usually to people he doesn't like. 

&gt;Before Harry Potter went to Hogwarts, and found himself on the roof once when his cousin, Dudley Dursley, and his gang were chasing him; this may have been a form of Apparition. He managed to grow all his hair back when his Aunt Petunia gave him a dreadful haircut using a pair of kitchen scissors. He also magically let a boa constrictor free from a zoo after he spoke to it in Parseltongue.

You're having no more of this, and while you were quite capable of having a weak dark lord inhabiting a young boy's body assassinated discreetly while on his way to the platform, you can't be sure that he's all *that* weak.  He'd know it was you if you failed.  Of course he would; like you ever managed to keep any secret from him.  You're certain he knows you're considering this.

And then he goes and retrieves that damned madwoman Bellatrix from Azkaban.  The less said about that the better.  Sometimes it seems like the entire rest of the world must be blind.

After the events between Hermione Granger (a filthy mudblood likely being taught dark magic to raise her as the next Bellatrix with power comparable to her master) and Draco, but any doubts you might have had are dispelled as he presents, as a *Riddle* in front of the full view of the Wizengamot, that even Dementors are now afraid of him. 

Now he owes *you* a debt, AGAIN, despite *everything* you've done to prevent it.  He then kills the young mudblood, discarding her as a liability.  Is this another message?  Is *Draco* now a liability?

1375744386.0,1jrv29,Let's restart the discussion about the Nature/Source of Magic with emphasis on the available data. (Spoilers),Toptomcat,108,23,146,"I've noticed a *lot* of people who are theorizing about the source/ultimate nature of magic in HPMOR without paying due attention to the data we got all the way back in Chapter 22

&gt;Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, come on, 'Wingardium Leviosa'?...

&gt;...But (Harry had reasoned) it didn't have to be that way

&gt;...what if you didn't know what the original spell had been like? What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn't studied yet, while others had one changed gesture, one changed word? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told her that a spell supposed to create a red worm was supposed to create a blue worm instead?

&gt;Well

&gt;...Harry was having trouble believing his results here...

&gt;...if you told Hermione to say ""Oogely boogely"" with the vowel durations in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 1

&gt;Not that belief was *irrelevant* here. Not that *only* the words and wand movements mattered.

&gt;If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what a spell was supposed to do

&gt;If you didn't tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do

&gt;If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to do, not the way she'd been told it should.

So. Let's start from the ground up and examine all of the in-story evidence we have about all the different sorts of magic we know of

Judging from the above, depends on a *combination* of the user's intent and some specific formal spell actions- wand movements and incantation. Specific, reproducible changes to the spell actions (syllable length changes) produce specific, reproducible changes to the spell effect (lack of bat glow). Some rare, specific, reproducible changes to the spell actions appear to produce improvements (*Stupefy* to *Stuporfy*, Chapter 86). 

These altered spell effects brought about by changes in the spell actions are not generally in the habit of being dangerous

Seriously incorrect intent or lack of specific intent produces total spell failure: mildly incorrect intent results in the spell acting in the 'conventional' way. (But note that mere knowledge that a spell is to be directed at an enemy is sufficient for the six-year Gryffindor to cast a powerful Dark curse in Chapter 26.) 

Charms are fatiguing to use (off the top of my head there's a clear example in Chapter 78 where Draco exhausts himself casting many Locking Charms in succession.) There is such a thing as 'raw magical strength', the user's age, and with the frequency with which they practice. 

Unanswered questions: 

* The specific permutations of failure associated with specifically mistaken or incomplete intent about what the spell should do. 

* The specific permutations of change associated with specific sorts of change to the steps (known changes: wand movements

* The exact determinants of magical strength: in particular

* Some spells require an *emotional state* in addition to formal  spell actions and a specific intent for success. These include Avada Kedavra (caster must want the target dead as a terminal value) and the Patronus (caster must have a certain special kind of warm fuzzies.) They are both notable for being exceptionally powerful/breaking rules: AK can't be blocked or deflected

* One spell (the Patronus 2.0) appears to uniquely require an *ideological conviction* to cast (rejection of Death as the natural order). It breaks more rules harder and faster than the above two spells. Are there others? Are they similarly powerful?

* Why is the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, 'Ravum Calvaria', and 'Lucis Gladius' have independent effects?

* Wordless Charms exist- see Bahry One-Hand 'thinking wordless spells to put more layers on his shields'. Are these an entirely separate class of Charm

* The means of creating new Charms is unknown at present. It may be as simple as trying permutations on existing Charms until a beneficial variant is discovered

Then there is **free Transfiguration.** Here, and the transformation between them) can produce widely varying effects, all of which are generally describable as turning one whole thing into another thing. Larger objects are harder. Attempts to turn something into an ill-defined general class of something else fail, even when backed with a great deal of focus and willpower (the failure to Transfigure an Alzheimer's cure or a desktop nanofactory in Chapter 28). Attempts to turn something into a specific example of something else, with detailed knowledge of its structure, succeed (carbon nanotubes in Chapter 28 again). Focused intent backed with detailed and accurate knowledge of physics-as-timeless-quantum-probability-distributions can break the 'whole objects into whole objects' rule. (again, the end of 28.)

Unresolved questions: 

* To what extent is free Transfiguration similar to Charm use in the use of 'raw magical Strength'? Harry is fatigued after completing his Free Transfigurations of water to rocket and wall-section to oil in Chapter 58

There's also **potions**. The traditional law here is that a potion 'spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients.' In an odd manner not associated with thermodynamics

Again, like mispronouncing a Charm. It can kill people, or turn them into catgirls. But it's possible to come up with a Potion on the basis of what went into it, then look up the proper stirring pattern.

Potions are explicitly *not* dependent on 'raw magical strength' as Charms are.

Unresolved questions: 

* What happens if you have a mistaken idea about the potency of what created the ingredients- what if you precipitated some copper from solution

* What happens if you have a different idea about the creation-potency- you want the supernova that made the copper atoms in the first place

Then we have **wandless magic.** This is a broad category including Legilemency, Parseltongue and Generalized Impressiveness. Commonalities: no sequence of steps, no tool, not apparently prone to being terribly unsafe to experiment with because Harry is not warned about liquefying his skull or going mad when practicing Occulumency. (This may be an unsafe generalization.) 

Types of wandless magic:

* Legilemency/Occlumency: Specific skills that must be learned independently

* Childhood accidental magic: I can't find any mentions of the classic canon examples- Harry's teleportation, intense emotional distress required, specific intent for a particular effect *not* necessary. Also presumably not generally unsafe, since we have nobody talking about magical kids' heads exploding under stress. 

* Parseltongue: Apparently inborn, can't apparently be improved through practice and study. No spell actions, no intent, no emotional state required: if there's a snake, you can talk to it. An oddball here. Intuitively 'feels' like a spell effect, not a sort of usable magic.

* Generalized Impressiveness: Whatever it is that Quirrell and Dumbledore can do. Seems generally reducible to telekinesis which can also affect some spells, but nonverbal Charms that require a wand to be in-hand but need no gestures- but Quirrell had *apparently* surrendered his wand at 79. 

Then there are **rituals**. From Quirrell's explanation of basic principles in Chapter 74, most often but not *always* a permanent sacrifice, and there's a night-and-day power difference compared to ordinary Charms. He goes so far as to say that the field of ritual magic 'contains all the furthest and most interesting reaches of wizardry'. Each ritual requires a 'chant' of what is to be sacrificed, and what is to be gained. They require wands (Chapter 23: '...the accursed Muggles had invented rituals that didn’t need wands...'). Known effects include multiple different kinds of better-than-Imperius mind control, Horcruxes, the bone of the father/flesh of the servant/blood of the enemy resurrection ritual, the spell of cursed fire/Fiendfyre. If Quirrell in Chapter 90 is to be believed, or else it will consume you. Whether other rituals behave similarly is unknown.

There are **magic items**. We know very little about how these are made. At least some of these appear to function in accordance to the understanding of physics of those who construct them- Aristotelian broomsticks, broomsticks. Some are not, such as the Invisibility Cloak and Philosopher's Stone. At least in canon, small-scale magic items of the reproducible type do not appear exceptionally difficult to make, since Fred and George were able to make some in their bedrooms as young schoolchildren and make a sufficient number and variety of 'joke' magic items to go into business immediately upon graduation. Also, there exist Charms that can create a one-time device that can reproduce another Charm- Harry got one from Flitwick to win the 'fight' with Moody in Chapter 86.

Finally


Now

**What is it?**

The best introduction is probably Chapter 22's preface:

&gt; PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres

&gt; HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read Godel, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

&gt; HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

&gt; DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

&gt; PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts

&gt; DUMBLEDORE is either insane

&gt; DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

&gt; Presenting:

&gt; HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

&gt; You ain't guessin' where this one's going.

**Oh

Yes

&gt; A word on the rules this fic follows. It is *not* a strict single point of departure. Changes from the original Harry Potter universe may occur for any of the following reasons:

&gt; 1) Changes growing out of the fic's single point of departure - a single event that happened differently

&gt; 2) Changes that smooth over the seams of the universe. When Rowling wrote the first book, if the curse really had been operating for decades, everyone would have noticed and would be expecting something to go wrong with Professor Quirrell.

&gt; 3) Changes that result from taking a hypothesis more seriously. For example, wouldn't politicians invite him to ceremonies marking the 10th anniversary?

&gt; 4) Changes to the laws of magic so that, because they are part of the background setting rather than the plot. This is not one of those stories.

&gt; 5) Changes that result from this not being a children's book. Writing a children's book is much harder than writing a story for grownups. I can't do it. Therefore this is a story for grownups... and that means it is impossible that an evil Peter Pettigrew is hiding out as Scabbers, it would mean Pettigrew was holding the Idiot Ball. It is a general law of MoR that no one is ever holding the Idiot Ball.

&gt; 6) Changes that result from a general philosophy of upgrading obstacles to match the more powerful protagonist. One illustration of this is that in *Goblet of Fire*, because this is not a children's story, and in a grownup story that plan would require Lord Voldemort to be holding the complete set of all seven Idiot Balls.

&gt; 7) Changes that are required to make the fic artistically complete when seen against the background of Harry Potter fanfiction

**But I haven't read the original books!**

Don't worry. If you watched a couple of the movies

**Okay

- Do *not* skip past Ch.13.

That was all well and good until Chapter 96:

So everyone knows that the Potters lived in Godric's Hollow. They had always lived there and would have continued to always live there and may still yet always live there.

I think even the Wizarding world isn't oblivious enough to hold these two blatantly contradictory beliefs at the same time.

I can only conclude that I'm wrong about the Fidelius Charm having been omitted from *Methods*. Or, by which people's location can be magically concealed from everyone except a secret-keeper.

But despite the breadth of knowledge this fanfiction describes, this will be mostly wikipedia and sequences from Less Wrong, but later I'd like to link to actual scientific studies. I've included some explanations of the original canon where I thought is was appropriate, but I'm mostly going to focus on the science and rationality bits. The first few chapters are rather easy, since they are short and EY provides his own explanations on the [website](http://hpmor.com/science/).

1346214883.0,z05r2,Is it possible to lie in Parseltongue?,need_scare,73,8,47,"spoilers up to ch 84

I have a working hypothesis that one of the properties of Parseltongue is that it is a language without the ability to lie

Currently


&gt;""We will tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond thiss. You ssay nothing

&gt;Harry nodded.

&gt;“Ansswer in sspeech.”

&gt;“Yess.” (816)

What reason would Quirrell have to demand Harry answer in speech, and that Harry's speech-act constitutes some sort of magical binding.

Note that Quirrell's only stated reasons for speaking in Parselmouth are to confirm that Harry knows it, unspoken reason that Quirrell wishes to communicate in Parseltongue.

The second conversation takes place after the breakout. Harry has just rejected PQ's plan to fake a Harry vs. Voldemort battle.


&gt;For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, from previouss failure. My planss are not in habit of failing, and lasst one would have gone flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss to follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin, tame your wild impulssess.”

&gt;“Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make girl-child friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am sstupid

""Somehow the words had just slipped out"" is an *incredibly* suspicious phrase. Maybe we can write Harry's impetuousness off as due to post-Azkaban stress, making moves against Hermione (H&amp;C dictionary attack; false-memory charm) and Draco (blood-cooling charm; eventually forced to withdraw from Hogwarts). Master plotter Quirrell would not form his plans so specifically around a single comment of Harry's without a high degree of certainty that Harry's seemingly impetuous statement is in fact truthful. 

If it is impossible to lie in Parseltongue

---

I admit that the evidence is not conclusive. I submit, and definitely cause for further attention and discussion.

Mainly that Gregory Goyle gets far more attention than Crabbe (not exclusive, and various things, as well as a bunch of moments of interest that simply focus far more on Goyle over Crabbe. 

Some of these are very mundane, although I haven't taken a hard count, just taking a mental note/estimation)

Either way here is a short list of the more interesting moments involving Goyle.

* Goyle takes initiative and thinks/tells Crabbe they need to alert Malfoy about Hermione's and Harry's kiss **ch46.**

-----

Chapter 12

Quirrell: 

&gt; ""Believe it or not

This is a known ambition of Voldemort in canon. Voldemort lays the curse on the Defense position when Dumbledore refuses to hire him for it.

-----

Chapter 19:

Quirrell: 

&gt; ""So while there's no point in asking any of you

-----

Chapter 19 also contains Quirrell's description of how he learned to lose at a dojo in Asia. He had to submit while his fellow students abused him verbally and physically. Later, but was denied and destroyed the dojo in anger, murdering the Master. Supposedly this demonstrates a weakness of Voldemort: he does not know how to lose.

Two strong pieces of evidence give a different interpretation to Voldemort's attack on the dojo:

One: Chapter 49: 

&gt; ""Rule Twelve

Two: Later in Chapter 19

&gt; ""... do any of you wish to show your dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around

&gt; Five hands went up.

&gt; ""Everyone with your hand raised

Thus it seems that Quirrell returned later to the dojo as Voldemort

-----

Chapter 20:

&gt;""Other people have done huge amounts for me!"" Harry said. ""My parents took me in when my parents died because they were good people

&gt;Professor Quirrell was silent for a time.

&gt;""I confess, that thought could not ever have come to me.""

In canon

-----

Chapter 20:

&gt; ""Precisely

&gt; [...]

&gt; ...when I discovered that Pioneer 11 would also be leaving the Solar System forever, ""I snuck into NASA, I did, and I cast a lovely little spell on that lovely golden plaque which will make it last a lot longer than it otherwise would.""

&gt; [...]

&gt; A further thought occurred to Harry. ""You didn't add any extra information to the plaque

&gt; ""Extra information?"" said Professor Quirrell

&gt; Which made Harry **rather suspicious**

&gt; [...] maybe you could've turned an existing part into a portrait of yourself? Or you found a volunteer dying of a terminal illness

&gt; ""Mr. Potter, ""**a spell requiring a human death** would certainly be classified by the Ministry as Dark Arts, regardless of circumstances. Students should not be heard talking about such things.""

[emphasis mine]

Quirrell turned the Pioneer Plaque into a horcrux. While this does not necessarily mean that he is Voldemort

-----

Chapter 40:

&gt; ""Anyway, inside a circle, inside a triangle?""

&gt; The deathly chill seemed to draw back,"" Professor Quirrell said after a while, a thoughtful frown on his face. ""That is the Resurrection Stone?""

&gt; [3 paragraphs later]

&gt; ""By the way

Quirrell did not know what the Resurrection Stone looked like before Harry told him (right after Quirrell warned him against inadvisably giving up important information for free!). In canon

This is foreshadowed in Chapter 26:

&gt; Professor Quirrell's expression became more serious. ""Mr. Potter

Much later

Harry:
&gt; ""I mean to bring Hermione back. Because there isn't an afterlife

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""How?"" [Quirrell] said finally.

&gt; ""However I have to.""

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell

""Obtaining"" it would be easy

-----

Chapter 46:

Quirrell:
&gt; ""Tell me, where would you put it?""

&gt; Harry considered this question. ""I suppose I shouldn't ask *what* you've found that needs losing -""

&gt; ""Quite, ""Perhaps you will be told when you are older,"" which Harry hadn't.

An allusion to Voldemort's horcrux(es?). Again we see that Quirrell expects Harry to eventually learn that he is Voldemort.

Amusingly

-----

Chapter 49:

After a vivid description of what Quirrell ""thinks"" is in the Chamber of Secrets:

&gt; ""One might even regret your infant self's victory, from one Heir of Slytherin to another."" The smile twisted further, as though to mock the obvious impossibility, even given the premise.

Quirrell is amused by his own joke

-----

Chapter 49:

Quirrell has turned into a snake and begun speaking in Parseltongue:

&gt; ""*This iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You ssee? No otherss undersstand uss.*""

&gt; ""*Even if they are ssnake Animagi?*""

&gt; ""*Not unlesss heir of Sslytherin willss.*"" The snake gave a series of short hisses which Harry's brain translated as sardonic laughter. ""*Sslytherin not sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss not ssame as Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw in sscheme.*""

Quirrell implies that he can only understand Parseltongue because Harry wills it. But note that Quirrell only says ""heir of Slytherin, which would explain why Quirrell has to be literally truthful.

-----

Chapter 49:

Quirrell:
&gt; ""You really care about that girl.""

&gt; ""Yes

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""I did not have any friends like that when I was young."" Still the same emotionless voice. ""What would have become of you

*Voldemort*

-----

Chapter 60:

Quirrell:

&gt; ""Call it a whim

A little joke of Quirrell's

-----

Chapter 70:

Quirrell:

&gt; A cold chuckle. ""I suspect it happens more often than any dare suggest, and by him be adored alone and utterly. And since she knows he can offer her no resistance, why, it is only natural for her to take from him whatever she pleases -""

I'm always shocked and infuriated by heroes in stories who throw their loved ones into the maws of psychopaths and murders because they can't be bothered with a quick consequentialist calculus. I've read multiple books where a hero is holding a gun and watches a villain calmly walk away after that villain has promised to murder/rape/torture his lover/child/family, IMHO.

I also figured Hermione wouldn't have ever tried to kill anyone. This was before I read Chapter 87. Specifically:
&gt; ""- the sort of things Malfoy has been saying about me? What he said he'd do to me

and

&gt;the second time I met him

Recall for a moment the violent physical reaction you (probably) had the first time you read Chapter 7. Now imagine that YOU are the target of Draco's rape-threats

Now imagine you've been mind-hacked by Mr Hat-and-Cloak, but he has the backing of a major Authority Figure at Hogwarts - Professor Snape. They can overcome you with magic, maybe just physically hold you down, and do whatever they want. Practically whenever they want, you've gotten to the point where you jump at shadows even in the middle of a televised event in a large public park surrounded by friends.
&gt; Even now, as though she expected Dark Wizards to jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.

She probably falls asleep terrified every night. It's likely she's thought of all sorts of ways to stop Draco, certainly not a mud-blood with no family accusing a noble of intent-to-rape.

Out of the blue an opportunity falls in your lap - Draco wants to meet. But he wants to meet in secret, to show him again that she is NOT powerless and he can NOT simply abuse her. But then she loses the duel, and he's standing over her triumphant and grinning down at her, and she realizes that she has no recourse at all, she can't even defend herself in a fair one-to-one fight, he could rape her right now if he wanted to. So he turns and leaves and Hermione does the SMART thing that every dumb-ass hero never did. She picks up her wand and she shoots him in the back and she escapes unseen. She will no longer live with that threat over her head. Draco will never threaten any girl at all that way - she's rid the world of a vile man who does evil, and the world is better off for it.

It's entirely possible Hermione would've confessed after the fact anyway, clears up some other odds and ends, and arranges it that Quirrell finds Draco's body just in the nick of time. This is *much* cleaner than Harry's proposed situation of tons of Memory Charms on both Hermione and Draco and then Obviations afterwards to remove evidence. It requires less access to Hermione and no access at all to Draco. If some time-turned individual *did* manage to observe or avert the duel, he'd see these events rather than the Puppet Master working intricate Memory Charms on two subdued students. It is elegant and... ""delicious"", in a sense.

1.  Check to see the strength of a spell around the globe.  Is there an area where magic is especially powerful?  That could indicate the location of the magical central computer.
2.  Run an extremely energy intensive spell and see if that affects a second spell in the vicinity.  E.g. use a potion to get extremely high level energy reaction - does that indicate a dip in the magical field in the area?
3.  Is the momentum or kinetic energy of a transfigured object preserved after the transfiguration is complete?  E.g. if Harry transfigures his large rock into a tiny pebble
4.  What exactly determines which energy is used when a potion is created, you extract the energy that went into making it.  But why don't you get access to the energy of the star that combined the protons and neutrons into gold atoms that make up the coin?  Is it a question of a stirring pattern or what?
5.  Is all of the mass of an object that was transfigured returned after it is transfigured back?  Or is some of it used up to power the reaction?
6.  We know that the state of the ""form"" during transfiguration is preserved - if you transfigure something into glass and then break it, bend the spoon, and then transform it back - what happens to the vase?
7.  How exactly does technology stop working around magic?  Is it EM interference of some sort?  Are components becoming magnetized?  What if you introduce a strong magnetic field to a spell - will the effect go in the other direction?

I have a theory about how Harry can save/revive Hermione. At the core of this theory is a means through which Harry may time-turn more than six hours. It also explains some (not necessarily all!) of the suspicious obliviations and false memory charms which we have seen in the story. It also offers a possible explanation of why Quirrel pointed Harry in the direction of learning obliviation instead of researching spell creation. 


The rest of this post is contingent upon questioning the following idea: we currently believe individuals carrying information cannot travel more than six hours into the past. In the HPMOR-verse

But if these three rules are, then how could Atlantis have been ""erased from time?"" A past effect can have a future cause, but an effect cannot have NO cause; you cannot pull the bottom blocks out of Time's Jenga Tower without wrecking the whole thing, and a hypothetical civilization that rose, developed magic, and then erased itself from time seems to violate The Rules.

Phoenixes are extremely useful. Their tears have strong curative powers; their teleportation ability seems nigh-unblockable; they have a built-in good alignment _and_ apparent morality detector; they are extremely loyal; they're apparently immortal (which could be _extremely useful_ for research if your long-term goal was universal immortality); they seem to provide strong emotional support in times of distress...and the list goes on.

Oh, which you aren't even told until after the trial.

Let's examine the evidence we have on phoenix acquisition mechanics:

* According to Dumbledore
* According to Dumbledore, task
* According to Dumbledore
* According to Dumbledore
* No other current wizards besides Dumbledore
* There are no organized attempts by anyone else to acquire phoenixes despite their very useful abilities (again

Let's assume that Dumbledore's explanation of phoenix acquisition mechanics is correct as far as wizards know (though Harry should research this question to confirm anyway). Immediate questions:

* How is the decision to send a phoenix made?
* Is there a collective phoenix conscience? A phoenix master? Is phoenix distribution directly controlled by the same force that implements magic?
* How does the phoenix collective keep track of heroic decisions
* Alternate hypothesis: Phoenix opportunities are very rare
* Related to all of the above: What exactly constitutes a decision worthy of a phoenix invite? What heroic efforts and ideas are not rewarded by a phoenix invite? Is the phoenix invite process deterministic
* What happens to a phoenix after its owner dies?
* Are there any wild phoenixes? How do they behave?

Possible means for Harry to acquire a phoenix subject to above answers:

* Die and come back (in a manner that resets the ""has rejected phoenix offer"" variable)
* Acquire Fawkes after Dumbledore dies
* Just keep making heroic decisions (assuming the one-phoenix/life rule is not an actual rule)
* Make phoenixes smarter/behave differently
* Get access to whatever controls Phoenix distribution
* Occlumency (to appear to be someone who has neer rejected a phoenix - how are phoenixes reading his brain-state anyway?)

The Headmaster can feel when a student dies in Hogwarts. That's how he showed up the moment Hermione died.

But the Headmaster can also feel when a creature unknown to Hogwarts is in Hogwarts. That's how he showed up when Harry rejected his phoenix.

But so why didn't Dumbledore feel the troll and intercept it much sooner? I expect before long the Dumbledore-haters — both those in the story and those on Less Wrong and Reddit — will latch on to this as proof that Dumbledore has been evil all along.

The problem is, that Salazar Slytherin was the one who wove them:

&gt; or by some entity which Salazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the Headmaster himself.

Salazar Slytherin's wards. Salazar Slytherin

Dumbledore will try to tell the wizarding world that the only explanation of Hermione's death is that Voldemort was behind the attack. This will be seen by the world as the same thing Headmaster Dippet actually did when Myrtle died: the accusation of an unlikely — ""preposterous!"" — scapegoat.

&gt; ""You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule

Here's what I understand so far:

1. Turning into a cat violates Conservation of Energy [because of E=mc^2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence): a 60kg woman turning into a 5kg cat would free up about 5 exajoules of mass-energy

2. Conservation of Energy is implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian because of [Noether's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem#Example_1:_Conservation_of_energy). Eliezer explains this in [the notes](http://hpmor.com/science/).

The first time I read this I was confused that Harry wouldn't use Voldemort's real name, and his reaction to it raises serious alarm bells.  Just saying that name produced the strongest negative reaction he'd displayed so far, and a fear reaction that seems way out of proportion to what I consider normal for him, to the point where I feel I have to explain it.

The only other time I can even think of that he acted superstitious was, even a ridiculous one, to just hide for a little while.  I can't understand him still saying 'You-Know-Who' when he actually believes he's dead for good, but at the same time it doesn't seem to indicate much.

There's no evidence besides this feeling to suggest such a thing, do you think that would count as an interaction between Harry and Voldemort's magic enough to give Harry a sense of doom whenever he says the word?

&gt; 
&gt; Riddle misread the prophecy in arrogance
&gt;
&gt; [Prophecy condition 1] 
&gt;
&gt; Born to those that thrice defied him: The Percivel brothers creating the Deathly Hallows.
&gt; 
&gt; [Prophecy condition 2] 
&gt; Power that he knows not: rationality, he won't fight back.
&gt; 
&gt; But a remnant is left as an exercise for the student

A few posts down /u/Brotep notes that it fits the second prophecy very well too: 
&gt; The second prophecy--he is coming/he is here--the one who will tear apart the very stars in heaven

The rest of the 2nd prophecy fits too. Death (entropy) will tear apart the stars in heaven. Death is the end of the world. 

Overall, and ties humanism and the dementors into the central conflict of the story. 

In Bayesian terms, the dementors could have easily been left out; arcs like humanism are far more likely in the story if death is the main antagonist. Likewise the unlikely match between the 2nd prophecy and Death. So, these arcs are significantly more likely in a HPMOR with death as the central conflict. 

I think that it's reasonable to take a posteriori confidence level of &gt;~80-90% that Death is the central antagonist. Here is my reasoning
&gt; P(S) = a priori probability of seeing this particular story (out of possible stories)
&gt; P(V) = a priori probability that Voldemort is the central antagonist
&gt; P(D) = a priori probability that Death is the central antagonist
&gt; P(D|S) = conditional probability that Death is the central antagonist given the evidence of the story seen so far
Assuming:
&gt; P(S|D) / P(S|V) (the likelihood ratio) = 50
&gt; P(V) = 70%
&gt; P(D) = 10%
Then:
&gt; P(V|S) ~ 12%

Still
&gt; ""Intermittent one fixed itself again. Other one's same as ever""

Was does that mean? There's an intermittent error and an other one. Which is to say a permanent one.

The intermittent one is consistent with the usage of a time-turner. It's probably Harry it concerns: the twins would pay more attention to him than others and he uses it as much as he can everyday. Other lesser candidates would be Dumbledore, she does not use it as much as Harry, and is probably less of an interest to the twins. She may even have gotten hers later than ch. 25).

So what's the permanent error on the map? I think it's fair to assume it's of the same nature as the intermittent

What we also learn in chapter 25 is the map is part of Hogwarts security system. Ie: the wards. What else did we learn about the wards

Imagine the professor had a troll

All of this is consistent with and reinforce the theory that Quirrell slipped a troll through the wards of Hogwarts by registering it along himself (see chap. 84

But there's more! What happens to the Marauder's map and the twins in chapter 88? The former is presumably stolen and the latter are obliviated. About everything concerning the map. It matters very much to a certain professor who would not want others to discover that the permanent error about him fixed itself once a troll was killed. And that this error appeared since

So it looks more like the Defense professor erasing all traces than just him preventing Harry and/or the twins from saving Hermione.

It did not seem to me all these elements had been previously linked together

Also for the sake of completeness

* The errors on the map are not about duplicate people. Then I don't see what to do with the information that there are errors on the map. It might be relevant later but the ward tampering problem is now (ch. 88-94)

* Quirrell did not consciously slipped the troll through the wards

* The troll was not slipped along Quirrell and Quirrell/some other bad guy really took control of the wards. For instance using the secret knowledge of Slytherin transmitted by his basilisk. The map problems are unrelated. Possible

Bonus: crazy theory on how to get a troll into Hogwarts! Step by step:

* 1 - Go on an diet to stabilize your stomach acidity to a precise pH level.

* 2 - Hunt a troll!

* 3 - Eat a spoonful of his brain

* 4 - Hurry to meet Dumbledore and be introduced to Hogwarts

""If someone's going to tear apart the Sun we're really in trouble!""

&gt;That seemed rather unlikely to Harry

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_lifting

Star lifting requires quite a lot of technical know-how and capability for a Type II civilization to accomplish

Chapter 78 took a few words to explain that ""A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients."" For the most part, is considered ""magical"" by Atlantis/the magic source code/whatever. Therefore its magical energy may be able to be tapped directly to power Harry's magic as he sees fit. Sort of like getting electricity through PV panels vs. oil or coal power plants. 

The limb that I would like to step out on is that all magic stems from that big ball of fire in the sky. As Harry put it in that chapter:

&gt;A light bulb was fueled by electricity

Except that this game is played back to the Sun. If Harry gets another *eureka* moment that makes that connection

How then would Harry tap directly into this infinite source of magical energy; a fusion nuclear reactor vs. those PV panels

Luckily, you could ""add a fireplace to the Network"" without physically going there. Create a very small fireplace designed to contain a bit of ~1.57×10^7 K plasma, add it and ""the Sun"" or ""Betelgeuse"" to the Network, and now you're cooking with Crisco! Or point that fireplace at Azkaban and we won't need to figure out what would happen if you threw a dementor into the Sun, he'd just bring the Sun to the dementors!

Now, and there was no mention of blood purity, even as a possibility or factor, despite that prejudice being a cornerstone of canon Voldemort's agenda. It united the Death Eaters, but there's no suggestion that Voldemort truly believed in it. EY, then, seems to be preparing his dark lord to represent some other motive for conquest (world *optimization*

Now, a clever/rational dark lord. Governmental overthrow via the Death Eaters is obviously an untenable plan. Even without considering the actions of the rest of the wizarding world, or the muggles, 50 Death Eaters could not hope to rule all of Magical Britain. So why would a clever Voldemort waste his time with revolution?

We return to point 1. Voldemort knew he would survive his death through his horcruxes. He knew he would be able to return in a new body

And that's when I thought of Quirrell's end-of-semester speech. He wants to unite all of Magical Britain under Harry's banner, his mentorship, and the Azkaban incident.

Conclusion: Either disguised as the defense professor, and now that it lurks in the shadows, and everyone braces for a second war, he intends to become the true power behind the next ruler (dictator?) of the nation.

Eliezer is on record as saying that he thought people would guess the entire plot to the book after the third chapter

The thread I mentioned above deals with this bit:

&gt; ""And Lily would tell me no, or a centaur told her not to

…And by my current reckoning that's probably 80% of what Eliezer was talking about. Let's add to that the following facts from the first three chapters *and* the permanent section of the Author's Notes:

- Petunia forgave Lily and raised Harry in a loving home
- McGonagall's two-second demonstration of Animagus powers makes a complete mockery of the whole of known physics; magic has potential far
- Harry intends to start ""the March of Reason"" all over again.
- ""If you make Frodo a Jedi
- ""Like meeting someone who had been a friend, some small aspect about Voldemort that was Light-sided.

So just from that

&gt; Harry Potter applies the Scientific Method to the domain of magic, with whom he shares a strange magical connection. The war between them, when it comes in earnest, will threaten to escalate to cataclysmic proportions.

That's a start

There are a couple of further details that may warrant inclusion somehow. First

&gt; Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything.

I'm a bit obsessed with this line, but we haven't.
  
To me, and the authorities come to him in disbelief that he would do it, and he says this line, dripping with disdain for all the peons around him. Perhaps we can use this to say that terrible things *will* happen in their war, not just ""will threaten to"".

Second

&gt; (And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it.)

I feel like I'm overthinking this. I feel like Eliezer really intended the answer to this to be obvious, so perhaps it simply refers to him not asking Question #1: ""How could anyone *know* that?"" Or maybe it's an actual inconsistency in the details, which Eliezer has privately screamed at us for not finding obvious.

I would like to propose a twist on this scenario. In my problem, or it is bolted to the floor, electrified, locked, and empty. This is determined randomly prior to you entering the room (For the purpose of this problem, we may assume 50-50, though it is also interesting when it is an arbitrarily small likelihood that the box is electrified)

If you touch the box and it is electrified, though non-lethal shock. You may assume that Omega has constrained the terms of your entry such that the only way to test if the box is electrified is to get shocked. It is a superintelligence, after all.

After you enter the room,"" if it predicts that upon saying that, you will leave without the box. Otherwise, it will say nothing.

It is now your turn to play the game. To your dismay, ""You will leave without the box."" Do you touch the box, or simply leave the room?

In the case where the likelihood of the box being electrified is arbitrarily small

I note that it seems to be the case that you must precommit to always touching the box (and follow through) if you want to be able to ever play the game. Otherwise you can never win (or lose). 

The reason this is relevant is that the answer to this problem has to do with how you should act in the presence of Time-Turners. If you receive information that something bad has happened and then don't try to prevent it, regardless of information about the outcome (including that of success, as you might then fail because you did not think it necessary to really try, since you had already succeeded, thus invalidating that as a possible stable time-loop).

1. **Tell Harry about the prophecy.** Harry doesn't *want* to destroy the world

  Further, there's at least a *chance* that Dumbledore will put that together. So even if he would have some motive to keep the prophecy secret, his archenemy already knows it, so what comparable harm would it do to tell Harry?

2. **Kill Harry.** Quirrell's plan for Harry has backfired. His #1 desire is to not die. He would flush all his other plans down the toilet if it meant he would not die. Without some incredibly strong *other* reason to want Harry to live

  Why would he not consider killing Harry? Probably the best reason would be if he knows or suspects that the connection between them would react badly to Harry's death, or get around the Godric's Hollow curse/ritual/pact/whatever-it-is somehow.) Or maybe Harry is a horcrux, and destroying a piece of himself is just something Quirrell could never bring himself to do, side effects be damned.

It seems to me that all of Harry's and Draco's energy is put into figuring out why current wizards are *weaker*

1) They had access to more powerful artifacts - or more likely shared the secret of one incredibly powerful artifact. The question, which is basically the same theory as Harry ends out with.

2) They were somehow half-breeds of extraordinary power. This hyopthesis would lead to the conclusion that four of this type of half-breed appeared at the same time. This would not likely be a coincidence

A horcrux allows the soul of the caster to remain on the Earth after their body has been destroyed. This is done by splitting the soul, Voldemort had created five Horcruxes when he went to Godric's Hollow. When the killing curse hit his body, his body was destroyed. His soul, however, remained fine. Weakened, he fled to Albania, where he had found Ravenclaw's diadem

Basically

The Horcruxes themselves have some level of being. The soul in the Riddle diary attempted to revive himself using Ginny

Having a Horcrux available is not needed for the resurrection. When Voldemort was revived, but no Horcrux. So basically, there is no need to be able to get to a Horcrux after you have made it, as you can still be revived if you do not know where it is. ",,False,self,1376802286.0,t3_1kl07x

""And Lily would tell me no, or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for it.""

Now, this seems to contradict the canon Lilly's generally sweet and kind demeanor; on the other, we have not seen enough of HPMOR Lilly to know her personality.

Petunia then meets Vernon, and EY, is the only reason we are reading HPMOR instead of ""Harry Potter and the Disappointing Conclusion"".

But what if the excuses she had made were not her own invention? Petunia specifically lists only two of Lilly's excuses. That the world would end, if her objection was spiteful. (But it is still possible, and in that case, case closed.) But if I were to guess one person that she had access to who's opinion she might not immediately discard would be her divination instructor. Trelawney, to my knowledge, should not be on the scene yet; but if she were it would fit her favored predictions of doom and gloom. In canon I remember her saying that the castle had been her home for 15 years in OotP, but I could be wrong or EY could be using artistic license.

The second excuse mentions nothing of the world ending, which we know from canon and a few mentions in HPMOR are powerfully insightful and perceptive of the future.

We know from both source materials that certain positions in Hogwarts attract certain sorts of witches/wizards. The divination instructor may not have been Trelawney herself

My thought is that either of those predictions, defeat the bad and do so whilst being saccharine sweet and making superman look corrupt. Rationalist!Harry is now in such a grey area that the other would call him dark. That darkness could have been what was foretold with the tellers trying to steer the life of he-who-would-stop-voldi into a morally unambiguous black/white mindset, lest he be tempted as we see in HPMOR. To me this theory reinforces the idea that Dumbledor's motives and actions could be more sinister and authoritarian than canon, since it was his intention that rationalist!Harry be raised by the bitter Dursleys.

This seems to be a powerful spell, and if the secret keeper dies then the secret is lost forever (unless they shared it with others), right?

The question I had in canon was why Voldemort didn't use this on his horcrux's location, canon Dumbledore basically said that he didn't do this because of his arrogance and he didn't believe anyone would find it anyway.

I... don't think Quirrelmort would make the same mistake

I think the whole 'hiding the horcrux' thing is, as knowing where his horcrux is/are doesn't really change anything for us.  But could he put his secret identity as Voldemort under the Fidelius charm in a similar manner?  No matter how hard people are looking, they can't seem to make the connection, although very few have reason to suspect, he seems to have at least fooled Dumbledore, which looked very suspicious to me from day one.  If he were to look deeper, he might find him hidden as the noble hero

Quirrell was identified as ""The Defense Professor"" to the security system, anyway.  This is a stronger spell than polyjuice, so could this interfere with the Marauder's Map revealing his true identity, causing the constant error Fred and George referred to?  

EDIT: Assuming that it only hides locations and not any piece of information unless someone else has a reason to believe otherwise.  What else could be hidden besides the location of a horcrux?  If it's location-based it couldn't be the probe

A few posters have accused Harry of holding the Idiot Ball in regards to this question

I think it's important to remember that Harry James Potter-Verres has been raised a rationalist and therefor a materialist; for him the soul is the mind is the brain, naturally exists, even though this is precisely what Dumbledore believes ghosts are.

Since being introduced to magic, the mind can function without its natural brain (animagi, where wizards and witches remain substantially themselves while thinking with animal and even insect brains). He has also met a true artificial intelligence (The Sorting Hat) and seen a temporary brain created from nothing (McConnegal's transfigured desk/pig). Ghosts actually shook Harry when he first saw them, until they were explained as ""psychic echoes""--an explanation he accepted because (in the HPMOR universe) ghosts don't seem to learn and change. Neither do otherwise apparently sentient paintings.

But knowing that magic can apparently map and emulate a brain just as easily as it can map a cat does not

And this is vitally important to the plot; if Harry became convinced of the possibility that Hermione still exists, given the foundation of magic that EY has postulated (basically a psionic Krell Machine?) and simple human nature, the lost Atlantians would have secured their own immortality and possibly everyone else's by also creating a mind-mapping function that preserves a recording of every human being's mind at the time of death; this may be the source of the ""soulexplosion"" Harry felt when Hermione died and other readers have pointed to.

But there is no reason for Harry to suspect this--for all he knows what he felt was perfectly natural

&gt; But for such as you and I, in reality and not pretense. [[63](http://hpmor.com/chapter/63)]

In this interpretation, and Quirrell, in addition to having an unknown number of additional identities for the bits of time during which he was relatively anonymous. He can switch between these identities fluently and rapidly, as in [[54](http://hpmor.com/chapter/54)] and [[59](http://hpmor.com/chapter/59)]. He has matured greatly over time and overcome much of his youthful trauma; Quirrell is a demonstrably much better-adjusted individual than Voldemort ever was. Even so, despite the ease with which he can assume a new identity, he remains the same individual. Points raised in favor of this theory often include the following.

* Quirrell planned [[25](http://hpmor.com/chapter/25)] and accomplished the murder of Rita Skeeter [[26](http://hpmor.com/chapter/26)]
* Quirrell has similar views to Voldemort as regards effective means of gathering power
* Quirrell's certainty about the fundamental innocence of Bellatrix Black [[51](http://hpmor.com/chapter/51)] is never explained; it is inferred that he knows first-hand how she was corrupted.
* Quirrell states that he was the unnamed hero

In short, his powers are sufficient, he was Voldemort in canon and as we haven't seen V elsewhere yet, the simplest explanation is that he is in fact him. 

**Points in favor of my position**

It is impossible to prove a case by seeking out the arguments that support it; you must instead disprove the arguments that falsify it. All of the above arguments are of the sort which support the assumption that Quirrell was in fact Voldemort

Consider instead the alternate hypothesis that Quirrell and Voldemort are entirely different people. Quirrell

The most direct argument is the case of the Oni Affair. When we as readers are introduced to it in [[19](http://hpmor.com/chapter/19)], becuase Amelia Bones references it in [[84](http://hpmor.com/chapter/84)]. There is simply no good reason why Voldemort would ever visit that monestary if, as Quirrell, he'd already mastered the arts taught there. Going to learn makes no sense; he had already spent the time and acquired the skills. Going to spread his terror makes no sense; it was an isolated incident, hushed up. Going for revenge for the humiliation makes no sense; even if in his persona as Voldemort he couldn't keep his temper and felt the need to revenge something that in his Quirrell persona he felt ""was one of the most valuable lessons [he] had ever learned,"" his demonstrated fluency in switching between personas should have let him avoid going to all that trouble and effort. No, the only reasonable solution here is that two different people went up to that temple

There is also the question of motive. If Quirrell was in fact Voldemort, he spent huge quantities of money and effort fighting a lethal public sham war against himself for years. If we assume that they're the same person, then Riddle would have had to kill the hero, presumably at the beginning of his disappearance, then assume his identity 25 years later, expend all these resources, then abandon the pretense again just three years later to no gain. If we assume they're the same person, who seems way too smart to squander all that energy to no gain, and lived a life pretty much as described. 

So what about the arguments above

* *Quirrell murdered Rita Skeeter*. This is both undeniable and somewhat troubling
* *Quirrell values the strength of unity over the flexibility of independence*. Anyone who'd lived through the Wizarding War could have drawn those conclusions after thinking them through
* *Quirrell rescues Bellatrix Black*. Frankly, rescuing someone he is utterly convinced to be innocent is a reasonable thing, and he could well have known Bellatrix personally as the unnamed hero before her enslavement to Voldemort. Being convinced of her innocence is no reason to claim that he is in fact Voldemort.
* *Quirrell quit being a hero and could have quit being Voldemort*. While technically true, based only on that common bit of history.

In short, and his powers are sufficient, known recorded history is evidence against assuming that Quirrell is Voldemort. Without Chapter 84, this argument is much harder to make; it's easy to understand why that hypothesis held a lot of attention for a long time. That said, we now have the new evidence; it's time to update our models and stop assuming that Quirrell is Voldemort. EY said right from the beginning that this fiction has multiple points of departure from canon, and the evidence available suggests that this is one of them.

&gt; Enrico Fermi and his colleagues started by bombarding hydrogen atoms with neutrons, when after bombarding fluorine with neutrons, they ended up with a radioactive fluorine isotope. Soon they began to synthesize other radioactive isotopes. Initially, they thought that high-energy fast neutrons would work the best for nucleosynthesis. Then they discovered an interesting phenomenon. They got different results when using a wooden table than when using a marble table. The results were better if the neutron source was placed on the wooden table. Fermi had a hunch that the neutrons were slowed down by the wood in the table. Afterward, he used water and paraffin to try to achieve the same result, slowing down the stream of neutrons. He was surprised to learn, contrary to their expectations, and so produced better results.

Harry attempted to investigate what have effects on magic (experiment with bats) but it is more than likely that there are some completely unexpected variables that are important (first year students, because the moon was in Aquarius on that day or maybe magic works in a different way in this single classroom[*](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1c8uzt/is_it_possible_to_cast_spells_without_knowing/c9fjb8m)).

1376584217.0,1kfdnm,[CH 97 Spoilers] Theory re: Draco,randolphkoma,38,11,44,"While reading last night's chapter I realized that there is a good deal of Bayesian evidence that Draco is himself an Occlumens capable of beating Veritaserum and possibly without Lucius' knowledge.

My chain of examples begins in chapter 24
&gt; Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write Father and explain that the money was gone because he had managed to loan it to Harry Potter, and ten times as many  Galleons just in case Harry Potter needed another loan.

I am assuming that Draco was roughly correct

Second comes in chapter 47:
&gt; ""Draco

&gt; ""OH THAT IS SUCH A LIE -""

&gt; ""I was trained by Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set it up. Look, I'm just warning you that I'm an Occlumens. Not a perfect Occlumens, but Mr. Bester said I was putting up a complete block, and I could probably beat Veritaserum.""

&gt; ""You're in your first year at Hogwarts! That's just crazy! ""

There are two cases under which this conversation could have occurred. The first is that Draco is already an Occlumens, including Harry. Additionally, he never brings up the idea that he himself is not an Occlumens as proof that Harry could not be one, and so is not lying to Harry.

The second case is that Draco is not an Occlumens; this would make my hypothesis less probable, he could now reasonably do something like arrange lessons with Gringotts without seeming ignorant enough for them to suspect that he was asking without his father's permission. In either case, he would have had somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 Galleons to pay for the lessons.

There are two more developments to note in chapter 97. The first one is minor:
&gt; A boy who was also Harry's creditor to the tune of forty Galleons

At the very least

Second is the fact that except for mentions of Hermione, the best fit for his actions seems to me that he simply did not know about this element of Harry's corruption of Draco.

So, when Lucius questions him under Veritaserum, Draco is able to tell him enough to give Lucius a sense of what Harry's ideals are, but keeps the genetics research out of the conversation.",,False,self,1376584865.0,t3_1kfdnm

I am going to assume that ""magic gene"" in inherited in normal way (DNA

So what we know: there are people

  * able to use magic (wizards/witches
  * unable to use magic
  * unable to use magic, not appearing in original books but they are in HPMOR and out-of-book materials by Rowling) - for example Petunia.
  * completely unable to use magic
  * able to use magic

It seems that everybody regards squibs and ""pseudomuggles"" as single group and there is no evidence against this.

Additionally

Based on this evidence Harry proposed theory that magicalness is a recessive trait, +-:squib, --:muggle).

But there is significant problem - this theory is unable to explain how wizard and witch may have squib children (++/++ will always result in ++).

Based on available evidence I suggest that magicalness is determined by a single gene, +!, !! and !-; squibs with +-, muggleborn with ++ and muggles with --. This is quite simple model that explains all situations and is not contradicted by available evidence:

magical parents

  * ++/++ resulting in ++
  * !+/!+ resulting in ++ or !+ or !!
  * !!/++ resulting in +!
  * !+/!! resulting in !+ or !!
  * !-/!- resulting in !- or !!
  * !-/!+ resulting in !- or !+ or !!
 
squibs

  * !-/!+ resulting in +-
  * !-/++ resulting in +-

muggleborns (or rather squibborns)

  * +-/+- resulting in ++

squib may marry muggle and have squib children

  * +-/-- may result in +-

note that with my theory magical parents may have true muggle children

  * !-/!- resulting in --

muggleborn married to muggleborn will never have squib children

  * ++/++ will always result in ++

and muggleborn are unable to have true muggle children (one + gene is guaranteed)

  * ++/?? will always result in +?

but muggleborn married to pureblood may have squib children (it may be more or less likely than in pureblood/pureblood marriage

  * !-/++ may result in +-

and muggleborn married to true muggle will have always have squib children

  * ++/-- will result in +-

but muggleborn/squib marriage may have magical children

  * ++/+- will result in ++ (or +- - squibs)

Moreover as squibs have the same genes as ""only recessive theory"" data collected by Draco is not disproving my theory (not that it is important*).

Maybe there is some kind of a secret mental inhibitor\development modifier that is being cast upon all the wizards of a certain age? 
 
* other magical communities — it seems like each country has its own magical community

* other races — there are centaurs as an independent creature race

* magical wands — are there any alternatives to them

* parallel dimensions — it is possible that wizards know something about them.

* animagi: is it possible to design your own animal, can the animagi form be specifically developed as an intermediary life form (as in, human→animal→human) which has a very short lifespan by itself but instead gives its owner the advantages of not having to care about digestive and reproductive systems? If designing a unique animal form is possible, then one can even transform himself into some sort of a biological tank or a jet.

* wizard eugenics — if I got that part right, as a young boy, wizard, noble house scion an the-boy-who-lived has) it would be possible to learn how to identify them, find them out, explain the situation to them and persuade them to bore these exceptional children (with a 25% success of having a wizard and a 75% success of creating additional future “breeders”) who will be taught how to use their exceptional abilities.

&gt;Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in Azkaban

'Kay, it very well might kill him.

Except I don't think he paid enough attention to his own thoughts the first time he ever cast his Patronus. Chapter 46:

&gt; Harry felt... well, but his hurts had been... bandaged, meliorated? It was hard to describe.
&gt;
&gt;Dumbledore was also looking healthier, then looked back to Harry. ""Harry,"" Dumbledore said, ""are you about to collapse in exhaustion and possibly die?""
&gt;
&gt; ""No, but a lot less than I thought it would."" ***Or maybe it gave something back, as well as taking...*** ""Honestly, I expected my body to be hitting the ground with a thud about now.""

When Harry casts his Patronus powerfully to no effect

So what happens if he casts his Patronus powerfully and kills a dozen Dementors? A hundred? Maybe he gains HP for every Dementor he kills. Maybe some percentage of the life force that a Dementor takes during its existence is absorbed back into whoever kills it.

This is why it hurts my heart so much for Harry to have turned down his phoenix: because both we and Harry have possible clues that wiping out the Dementors of Azkaban would actually be the *opposite* of deadly. Because maybe Harry really did fail on top of the tower that night

There was a short HPMoR fanfic about Harry going with the phoenix, but then, as more and more Dementors fell within his Patronus's radius, be strengthened, buffed beyond full health, ultimately blazing with phoenix fire himself as the last Dementors of Azkaban ceased existing.

In Chap 90 Harry has his Time-Turner unlocked, and a few minutes later came across future-Harry and Hermione talking about closed-timelike-loops and being told by future-Harry that he needs to convince McGonagall to unlock his Time Turner and go back in time to kill this troll or Hermione will die. Chapter 90 should have been about the social manipulation Harry had to pull off in order to make this happen, and 91 would have been the troll-battle itself.

But we didn't read any of that. We got what we got instead. Which means that Harry decides not to go back in time to save Hermione.

What? How?

When his Time Turner was unlocked Harry faced the exact same dilemma as we did

So he sits down to think. His Time Turner was only unlocked because Hermione Granger died. If he uses it to prevent her death

His resolve starts to waver. He begins to doubt.

There is much he does not know about what happened in the hours leading to Hermione's death. He saw her die

His father's rock is no longer on his finger... if he goes back in time will he be without that weapon and be the appetizer before the troll gets to Hermione? Maybe all her artifacts actually ARE in working order

Or maybe even worse things happen. He has no knowledge of the state of most of the world outside Hogwarts. It is entirely possible that right now Draco could be dead, doesn't involve him, and everything is fine. He's scared to find out. If Draco does die, that could send magical Britain into civil war. Two friends dead and a civil war - that would be worse, as Dumbledore warned. *And it could already be happening!*

That's only just the start. Harry has a very vivid imagination. For all he knows

And so Harry is paralyzed. Slowly

Hermione is not rescued. We do NOT read the events postulated at the top, but because him holding that superstition is a Novikov self-consistent result. Not having that superstition would result in paradox and is not allowed, even if it is as insanely unlikely as unfolding a piece of paper and reading ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"".

So Quirrell is Voldemort. This has been said by many to be ""obvious"", despite all the signs: his admitted Dark ambitions, his multiple identities, killing Rita Skeeter, freeing Bellatrix, the zombie mode, the sense of doom, the fact that he was possessed by Voldemort in canon

The reason why it wasn't obvious is that it's really hard for me to assign Quirrelmort plausible motivations that describe both Quirrell's behavior and Voldemort's. 

If we can imagine that Quirrell and Voldemort are separate

Quirrell: A hyper-intelligent sociopath of the CEO variety

Voldemort: A cartoonishly evil sociopath of the serial killer variety, trying to get his minions to kill Harry's friends and get his hands on the Philosopher's Stone. 

But now that we know they are one and the same

* Why is Voldemort forging such a close relationship with Harry? Why is he training him? Why doesn't he just use any of the infinite opportunities to kill him that have presented themselves? 
* If Voldemort is incredibly intelligent
* Why is he going around acting blatantly evil in front of Dumbledore and co.? Why did he tell his class on the first day that he used to want to be a Dark Lord and even assembled an Evil Overlord List? Wouldn't it be better in pretty much every way
* It seems to me like Quirrell is not merely hosting Voldemort like he was in the books. His personality is not that of a man torn in two. So... if he's in the body of a highly powerful magic user

There's no way I can think of to assign motivations to Quirrelmort that aren't absolutely *weird*. This story doesn't do convoluted Triwizard-Cup-as-a-Portkey plots

What if AK was designed to be part of a process for backing up

What if Quirrellmort has uncovered the process and uses AK properly?

People have been talking about Hermione being horcruxed or somesuch, or maybe he just wants the contingency plan of restoring someone, or maybe he's *intending* to restore everyone he's ever apparently murdered and is actually working, at least he thinks, ethically.

Imagine the ramifications if every AK Quirrellmort has ever cast was actually just recoverably storing his victim's soul.

The 'wanting the person dead' thing might make sense since you're killing their body, it could just be straightforward murder that does that, but if AK itself has some such effect integral to it, could it be something to do with adopting the mindset that the body's death is irrelevant? Most people would call that cracked. Harry's considered pretty crazy for holding ideas of that class.

I'm not sure that this squares with information we've got as a result of Harry's Patronus 2.0 and Dementors though. If AK's preference for death over life is translated to ""brain in a jar over constrained to a body"" then Patronus 2.0 probably needs an equivalent translation, antitranshumanist, and that Dementors are...?

Why they are inactive?

* They are no more powerful than a typical person (maybe they are Muggle/Squib alchemists)
* They created colony somewhere (maybe on the Mars) and they invite selected people
* They are active
* They are active but not under their name (Dumbledore=Flamel etc)
* They are dealing with things more important than Grindelwald/Hitler/Stalin/Global warming
* There is some other entity that would react for their activity
* There is some extremely long-term plot that requires their inactivity

Why they keep the Stone for themselves?

* Supply of magic/materials used by The Stone is limited
* Revealing secret would end in disastrous catastrophe
* Only some people may make The Stone (it may be purely random selection or something in the style of HPMOR!phoenixes)
* Stone is received in the same way as HPMOR!phoenixes
* They are unable to reveal the secret (The Stone was created by accident
* ""World is not ready"" - they think that revealing the stone would be unethical 
* Production is highly unethical/dangerous/causes really bad effects
* Stone is not real

Both

* Weird ethical system - maybe there are not caring about anybody else? They consider extending lifespan of everybody as a bad thing?
* To keep stone working they must not interfere with world
* Flamels are a fictional entity it is a cover for wizards trying to avoid fame or using it as alter ego

From this we learn that Dumbledore - who heard the whole of it - has assumed that P2 refers to Voldemort as the one who is to come. From his perspective this seems pretty reasonable

To borrow the Defence Professor's analysis, while possible, seems initially to be less probable than the inverse.

However, maybe it is being warned against in this instance due to time/magic/seers having some preference for the status quo? Could it be that fate is opposed to a technomagical singularity (which surely would eventually come about as a result of HJPEV's optimisations)?

EY has demonstrated that all those adult characters are capable and actively using rationality, or fainting, or something. That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on anyone.

One of the defining characteristics of good fiction is that a character must undergo change as a response to the circumstances of the story. 

I repeat I notice I am confused by the assumption around here that Voldemort is attempting to take over the world.

Putting those thoughts together and a few starting assumptions.

*Quirrellmort goes out of his way to avoid lying if at all possible. 

*Quirrellmort knows that his current body will not survive much longer for reasons that he can't not stop.

*He had childish desire to be the next dark lord but recognizing through his list and being rational

*his pessimism about people is true and tends to suggest that he his desires are counter to ruling and obscured but orthagonal to that idea.

*Quirrellmort stated actually truths in the following quotes:

&gt;""&gt;Sometimes, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, long time to get there

&gt;""I will say this much, to such as us, what it means to other people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and the true difference about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be larger than them in order to enact them within his mind. To an actor or spy or politician, the limit of which face he may wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, Mr. Potter, and so great in your circumference

&gt;""you need not fear me for having discovered your secret. I am not going to tell you to give up on becoming the next Dark Lord. If I could turn back the hands of time and somehow remove that ambition from the mind of my child self

now let's put some if/then statements into this.

*If we assume that Tom Riddle is Voldemort

*if each of those are ""anyone we can imagine

*then each of those Characters are in fact real and whole characters separated from one another in actions as well as desires.  

*If EY has the goal of demonstrating that rationality gives you the ability to change your mind 

*Quirrellmort is actually very well versed in Rationality

*if Quirrell is really as powerful at rationality as he seems to demonstrate

*then is it rational to assume that Tom Riddle's desires are the same through out each character shift that he has undergone

More to the point, in fact seems to have built an enduring relationship with harry, protected multiple people from the abuses of the system (""One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what is right.""), to teaching hundreds of children how to personally protect themselves while being in reality """"Professor Quirrell could be the only competent Defense Professor we get in all seven years at Hogwarts"" ""we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, we cannot! If he but stays through January our fifth-years will pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months

and at that point I am confused about how I am supposed to read Quirrellmort other than he is potentially the most powerful emotional anchor as well as potentially the most changed character from the start to the end of the story .

my guess is that Quirrellmort has in fact undergone personally growth and his real desires while clouded could be considered good.

It's undoubtedly the case, as most books are read. But I don't know whether I think it's a good, bad, or neutral difference.

###Analysis

When I first starting reading HPMOR it was being updated regularly

The end of the initial spurt seems to have been with the release of Chapter 69

That's 70% of the progress so far

After that EY started updating noticeably less frequently

I worked out that if EY had maintained his initial slower pace after Chapter 69 (before he started leaving big gaps between updates) to this day we'd now be at nearly 1500 pages. We are actually about that.

So he hasn't at all slowed down since The Great Slowing

---

###Postamble

It puzzles me that this can have happened

I would *totally* understand if he'd stopped writing it altogether, there are plenty of reasons for that. But he's had the whole story in his head this whole time and isn't, as far as I know, not interested in writing it any more.

I'm not saying his initial pace was manageable in the long term

You still here? Good. I decided to make this thread as any new discussion would likely be drowned out in the main thread.

&gt;""HE IS HERE. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY STARS IN HEAVEN. HE IS HERE. HE IS THE END OF THE WORLD.""

For purposes of this discussion I will assume that this is a prophecy and not simply someone shouting really loud, say, someone suddenly releasing a stored recording of an earlier prophecy, and that the Defense Professor hears it.

Thoughts roughly in order of the wording:

* The Defense Professor need not be the intended recipient of the prophecy. There could be someone around both of them who is (unlikely).
* If the Defense Professor is the intended recipient
* The fact that ""HE is here"" is mentioned twice with the same wording. Does that possibly mean that the two instances do not refer to the same ""HE""?
* The term ""here"" is not well-defined in terms of scale. Does this refer to a few meters around the Seer? Hogwarts? Britain? The World?
* The prophecy says that the HE will tear apart the very stars in *heaven*. I am not familiar enough with the English language. Can ""heaven"" really be used thus interchangeably for sky (or space)? Or does it perhaps refer to something more metaphysical
* What might qualify as a star in context of a prophecy? Would
* What ramifications would tearing apart a physical star have? You might get a huge amount of energy out of it to power whatever you want
* ""THE END OF THE WORLD."": World is not well-defined in this scope. The end of Earth? The end of the universe? The end of the ""world as we know it""
* As I stated somewhere else
* The prophecy says that ""HE"" *will* tear apart the stars. No ""the power to"", no buts.

There's a popular belief that I subscribe to that suggests Riddle did not intend to kill Harry that night and certainly did not cast the killing curse on Harry.  If that's the case

Riddle came as Voldemort and killed his parents, and a child with a scar. There was only One witness; Harry Potter.  No one ever asked him about the event, but everyone knew what happened; even though everyone was COMPLETELY certain that the killing curse could not be blocked, they believed it had here for no adequately explained reason.  The only reason they would have for even believing it was Voldemort who had died was the prophecy, which is not exactly a trustworthy thing.  Unless...

There is at least one possibility though.  A skilled legilimens (Dumbledore?) reads baby Harry's mind and gains the event recording that way.  However, because they are incompatible with that desire.  This suggests Riddle was preying on peoples' storybook instinct to give them a satisfying end, even though it was completely implausible.  This, at least, makes sense to me.  A sappy end to a grimdark villain.  Quirrellmort was extremely cynical about the affair, suggesting that no one would even think it odd if he came back to life and tried for a second shot, because of how perfectly fitting it seemed.  This would imply that he arranged the whole thing just to hijack the prophecy and make it look like it was fulfilled.

At some point after that, this means that either Bellatrix came in and took the wand, ignoring her master's body and the baby, or that Harry's rescuer (was it Dumbledore or Hagrid that rescued him in this story?) came in and took Harry, ignoring the wand. I am confused here.  I suppose if Hagrid came he wouldn't have tried to locate the wand, but while it's possible Dumbledore wouldn't have done a quick spell-check for it, I just don't see it.

I am confused and I want more information.  What happened that night at Godric's Hollow?

To remove trauma from a victim? It clearly leaves behind echos in reflexive actions, which presumably is more suited to this purpose, and has the advantage of being reversable.

To use on a convict to, or simply has close contacts on the outside. Magical witness protection would be far more effective.

To use on yourself, under the initial premise that it isn't the spell itself that's unforgivable, but the undefendable removal of another's autonomy through magic.

If you're willing to stretch the definition of good, the true reason it's a permitted spell. It's simply too useful to the ministry's masquerade efforts. If every human had the potential for magic (they probably do, likely all it would take is commenting out a line of code on the magic engine), there would be no reason to cover things up, or have a two-tiered justice system where non-practitioner witnesses are something to clean up rather than debrief. 

That last one seems to be strong enough to hold it off the list, AKing a consenting, dying wizard to a painless end seems more than forgivable to me, as does using the imperious to gather intel of a cultist's den. I would support a reclassification of the unforgivable spells to first degree murder, some class of greivious bodily harm, and abduction, and bring it back into line with the rest of the british system of punishing one for what is done

""the six-century-old Nicholas Flamel

To which Harry responds:

""Um

However, but more importantly we get two references:

Chapter 77

""there are Charms laid there of ancient power

So Quirrell

Next, Dumbledore tells Minerva:

""I asked as much of Flamel, I am sorry, but it must be done - must!""

So Flamel is alive (or something approximating life enough that he can communicate with Dumbledore) in 1991

The next question thus has to be what is the nature of the Philosopher's Stone. Put aside the gold aspect, I'd expect Harry to be pretty freaking outraged when he discovers the Stone's existence, and basically accuse Flamel and everyone who cooperated with him of being the greatest mass murderers in history, having held back life from the billions of people who have died in the last 600 or so years since the Stone's creation. In this scenario Flamel presumably agrees with Dumbledore that death is necessary, and excludes himself from that either through selfishness or as a needed sacrifice to keep the world safe rather than 'embark on the next great adventure.'

On the other hand

1) It requires some awful sacrifice to create or use: Horcruxes are a bad way to achieve immortality because they require a murder

2) Only a limited amount can be made: In Chapter 87 Hermione says the method of creating the Stone is widely known, the world might tear itself apart competing to be one of the lucky few immortals. Most extreme case would be that Flamel's Stone only produces enough elixir to keep himself, and maybe his wife (only mentioned in regular HP, not HPMOR) alive. Of course that's problematic because he apparently has enough of a stockpile to leave the Stone in Hogwarts for a while. Still, somewhat plausible.

3) The Stone can only be used by it's creator: creates the best moral argument for Flamel just chilling

4) The Stone has side-effects: Maybe using the Stone saps a wizard's power or has some other bad side-effects. This would explain why Flamel apparently doesn't feel confident defending himself from Voldemort


Ultimately, and it's role in canon, I predict that both it and Flamel will be vital aspects of the final act of HPMOR. Unless the Stone can raise the dead it doesn't solve ALL of Harry's problems with the world, but it's a pretty good start.

1365805408.0,1c8i43,The 27 privacy spells revisited,ryanvdb,25,3,37,"The conversation earlier piqued my interest. I've written a small document about what ensuring privacy does.

Goals: to ensure that no-one is able to listen into a conversation as it happens. It does not protect against:

1. people knowing about the conversation (e.g. you can be seen entering and leaving Mary's Room) (Specifically: i'm not concerned about mechanical cameras.)
2. a participant sharing the information later (willingly or otherwise, pensives, etc)

I've classed the magics required into two categories: wards and detection. The wards are spells that are required to last for the whole meeting - you don't want someone to unknowingly appear during your conversation. ""Detect"" spells are require to detect if the specified object (or magic

There is a good reason for the requirement for the detect spells to last until all detect spells have finished. This is to protect against changes while the privacy spells are going up. For example, at which point they change into their insect animagi charm, dropping the disillusionment charm. This person has now successfully infiltrated the meeting.
  
The list

1. ward: (travel) apparation
1. ward: (travel) port-key
1. ward: (travel) floo (new connections)
1. ward: (travel) portals (ala vanishing cabinet) (new connections)
1. ward: (travel) phoenix travel
1. ward: (travel) time travel
1. ward: (travel) physical (e.g. walking through the door
1. ward: (travel) house-elf popping
1. ward: (travel) anti-taboo (under travel b/c taboos allow for traveling to the location
1. ward: (travel) ghosts
1. ward: seers
1. ward: patronus
1. detect: ghosts
1. detect: patronus
1. detect: paintings
1. detect: concealments (harry's invisibility cloak)
1. detect: concealments (""normal"" invisibility cloak)
1. detect: concealments (dislillusionment charm)
1. detect: concealments (other?)
1. detect: animagi
1. detect: metamorphmagus
1. detect: sentient life forms (humans, centaurs, gnomes, dwarfs, etc)
1. detect: open floo connections
1. detect: open portals
1. detect: familiars (see note below about animals)
1. detect: electronics
1. ward: magical connections from this area to outside the area (e.g. protean charms / magic mirror)
1. detect: magical connections from this area to outside the area (e.g. protean charms / magic mirror)
1. detect: transformed objects (don't want a transformed recorder to revert to its natural form in the middle of the conversation)
1. detect: stealth magics
1. detect: listening charms
1. detect: recording charms
1. other: break/remove mind-control magics
1. detect: undead (added after edit)


Assumptions:

1. I've also assumed that the wards protect against new/incoming magics
1. I don't believe that the order of the casting is important (due to the assumptions about wards/detect spells)
1. I assume that the physical ward prevents all physical interactions accross the boundaries.  This includes blocking sound, sight-blocking spells, globe of silence)
1. Some of the spells to detect one thing my work for the others (e.g. detect sentient life forms be sufficient to detect metamorphmagus)
1. I don't think a detect animals spell is required. I don't recall that animals can understand/reproduce human conversations. Not even snakes. I believe that it would be inherently impossible to use a pensive to view an animal's memories to reproduce the conversation. However, kill life-forms smaller than the specific size. You would have to kill all insects in the area, and there would be too many than the detect animals spell would be useless.
1. The detect spells inform the caster by directly imparting the knowledge to the caster instead of causing the detected item to glow. This is so that physically hidden/shrunken items are noticed.
1. The extendable ears provide a physical presence inside of a globe of silence (or mufflato spell), and can not be added in later (physical ward) (which I believe is how it is done in canon).
1. A ""detect magic"" is not possible
1. ""Thief's downfall"" magic can't easily be used

Unknown how to protect against:
Non-electronic recording methods (e.g. phonograph cylinder

Notes:

1. I suspect that, I assume to detect all types of (non-animagi) transformations, you need to cast more than one spell.
1.  Due to lack of knowledge about the mechanics

What if there was a way to combine magic with Computer Science and computer programming?

Such a magical computer by itself could revolutionize the combination of magic with technology. Such devices could be built into magical tomes which interface with the Internet (*), much as it did in this one, resulting in greater and greater awareness of the potential in combining the powers of the magical and muggle world.

Clearly, as is the case with apparation; or some*when* new, as is the case with time-turners.

The mechanisms behind these various techniques remains shrouded in mystery given the difficulty in differentiating between exactly what goes in one end and comes out the other, exactly.

But not for long. As shown above, we can make 2-3 concrete predictions regarding what exactly may of may not happen.

Transfiguration is the best means of testing these three mechanisms in general, it only changes a *part* of the whole.

That in mind, you transfigure *half* of the sphere into something else and maintain that transfiguration for the next ten minutes. Now, half of the half of the sphere that was composed of the pure carbon-11 for the full twenty minutes will under go radioactive decay no matter what, making it our control, while 3 possible events will take place for the half that unwent the partial transfiguration.


## Scenario 1

Half of the carbon-11 that composed the partially transfigured half will also have undergone radioactive decay.

This would be known as the *spacial-translative theory of transfiguration*

Thus


## Scenario 2

Half of the carbon-11 that composed the partially transfigured half will not undergo radioactive decay for ten more minutes.

This would be known as the *temporal-translative theory of transfiguration*

Thus


## Scenario 3

Half of the carbon-11 that composed the partially transfigured half will not undergo radioactive decay for twenty more minutes.

This would be known as the *transformative theory of transfiguration*

As we are aware

Now obviously this is a difficult issue to deal with. I mean, that magic, in its capacity to perform work and what not, transforms and makes use of energy in a variety of forms and thus has real world quantitative values associated with it at every level.

And, to determine what they are and to see how they relate to the HPMoR universe in general as well as the long speculated of Source of Magic itself.

Still

Magic can exert its influence in a variety of ways, although that can be considered a separate issue for the time being.

Still

Our original poster did offer the possibility of measuring this in the form of *mana*, often associated with a particular individual and/or magical artifact.

He proposed to measure such by determining just how long one can sustain a *lumos* with a luminosity of 1 candella before succumbing to magical exhaustion.

The number of seconds over which said *lumos* could be maintained would then be considered the amount of *mana* associated with said individual.

While this particular definition of *mana* is  very simple and elegant it’s also fairly limited

And that’s where Randall Monroe comes in.

In the XKCD What-If article “Yoda”

Limiting his investigation to the original trilogy

As stated in the article

In the case of Yoda, taking into account the .9g surface gravity on Dagobah, this feat came out to about 19.2 kW.

However, if constantly sustained as ""a continuous arc of pure electrical energy”, ""the power could easily be in the megawatts"".

However

Thankfully, most likely due to electromagnetic interference (EMI).

EMI comes in multiple forms, and broadband noise] to pulse or transient interference [in the form of isolated and/or repetitive electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events].

Furthermore, magnetic/inductive, and radiative coupling.

By testing how magical environments affect other known objects that are sensitive to these different coupling mechanisms

For initial investigations I'd propose something involving iron fillings or a magnetic compass given Harry’s general preparedness just to keep things at a minimum without introducing unnecessary variables

If the iron filings align with a transient electrical field or the magnetic compass were to become deflected or begin spinning

These baseline measurements could also help to establish a more direct correlation between magical exhaustion and work done in general.

Furthermore

While magical users do act as means of directing magical processes

This has been bothering me for a while: why is Prof. Quirrell so damn powerful? Sure, his apparent method of resurrection (possessing Quirrell) should have left him weak. Here are the three methods which Dumbledore assumed Voldemort could have used to return to life:

1
&gt;I have studied many books I wish I had not read, which Flamel assures me that not even Voldemort could create on his own; by that road he would rise greater and more terrible than ever before. I would not have thought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of the Stone, still less because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. 

2
&gt; His second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a perfectionist -"" Albus glanced at Severus, who nodded agreement, ""- and he would certainly seek the most powerful combination: the flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood of Harry Potter, and the bone of his father. 

3
&gt; Voldemort's final avenue is to seduce a victim and drain the life from them over a long period; in which case Voldemort would be weak compared to his former power.

So that leads to several questions:

a) *Did* Voldemort use method 3 to become QuirrellMort? It appears to be the only way he could have done it

b) If he used method 3,"" without even using a wand.

c) Maybe he used method 3 to become QuirrellMort

And all of this makes me realize that I am confused. I certainly don't claim to be a good rationalist... but the evidence suggests something impossible: powerful possessed QuirrelMort. And *that* lead me to this question:

x) Did Voldemort really die when he attacked baby Harry? We know about the magical resonance between them

&gt; ""The Dark Lord came to Godric's Hollow, and he killed Lily, and he came in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at you, and that was where it ended.

The Elder Wand: how would a Wand of Invincible in Combat help defeat death? I would suggest that the Elder Wand is ""simply"" a powerful magic amplifier; using it in combat makes your shields unbreakable and your curses unstoppable

The Resurrection Stone: in MoR, or (broader interpretation) a receiver/transmitter capable of tapping into some artificially created virtual Atlantean afterlife/database and projecting a true mind-emulation of anyone who has ever lived.

The Cloak of Invisibility: renders the wearer undetectable by and impervious to Dementors. I have no idea what its significance as a prophesied tool for defeating death is.

Conclusions: none yet. The Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone together may be enough to wholly recreate a subject through transfiguration

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
I am coming around to the theory that the devices in the prophecy may not refer to the Deathly Hollows

&gt;Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor McGonagall with his eyes.

&gt;""Yes

&gt;""Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target that is static, I'm terribly sorry, let's just say a steel ball.""

&gt;Professor McGonagall shook her head. ""Mr. Potter

This is the evidence we have against Harry doing something like transfiguring Hermione's body into a diamond. Discussion to the contrary necessitates that for certain substances the changes must be insignificant

However

&gt;""And above all, especially yourselves. It will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you Transfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change."" Professor McGonagall paused. ""Mr. Potter is currently holding up his hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation - specifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But **an Animagus transformation is not free Transfiguration**.""
  
&gt;Professor McGonagall took a small piece of wood out of her pocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she said ""Crystferrium! "" and the glass ball became a steel ball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball became a piece of wood once more. ""Crystferrium transforms a subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid steel. It cannot do the reverse, at least so far as physical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration must be done wordlessly. **Using Charms would require different words for every different transformation between subject and target**.""

above emphasis mine

&gt;Professor McGonagall went on

and finally

&gt;There are Charms and potions which can **safely

So

More interestingly we see a rule of transfiguration that I don't believe is ever made explicit in the original canon.

&gt;Using Charms would require different words for every different transformation between subject and target

**NOTE**: From here on is a possible conclusion I've drawn from the above facts, even considering these passages.

So safely performing a transfiguration of Hermione-&gt;diamond would effectively require a new spell. This is unfeasible within a mere six hours, but he's never used it because ""Do not mess with time"" carries potentially big consequences.

I have a question about the study of blood. My grasp of biology ends at the high school level so someone please correct me if any of the following is wrong...

When Harry and Draco study blood, and muggles.  However, since squibs can't perform magic, this implies that the gene for magic is recessive, since you have to have both copies in order for magic to be expressed.

However, they can only pass on the recessive allele. Thus, it should be impossible for squibs to be born from two wizards. However, it seems that in canon there are squibs born in wizarding families.

&gt; ""- and besides I've been reading about evolutionary psychology, there are all these suggestions that one man and one woman living together happily ever afterward may be more the exception rather than the rule, and in hunter-gatherer tribes it was more often just staying together for two or three years to raise a child during its most vulnerable stages - and, I mean, considering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional marriages, it seems like it might be the sort of thing that needs some clever reworking - especially if we actually do solve immortality -""

That's an awfully strange chain of reasoning from a kid who was raised by a loving family, it doesn't seem like the kind of mistake he'd make. 

It's particularly surprising now, with the House of Granger swearing fealty to the House of Potter. I guess it really hadn't occurred to him to think very deeply about the institution of marriage, and he was just blurting out whatever random thoughts popped into his head.

I'm really, Harry starts to buckle down and look into communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution techniques. Surely by now it's been thoroughly demonstrated to him to be his greatest weakness. I also think it's long past time he takes Hermione aside a teaches her the secret to a True Patronas: there are many outside benefits there, but the biggest would be that it would help them both gain a little more perspective into each other's thought processes, which they both sorely need at this point.

Re-reading this today - essentially a re-statement of part of the prophecy - I'm struck by another interpretation of the line

* Probable: Harry's Mysterious Dark Side is a piece of Voldemort.

* Known: Harry has had a better childhood than was expected and a *much* better childhood than Tom Riddle did - hence, the ability to cast Patronus 2.0, etc.

So

""power the Dark Lord knows not"" 

and Dumbledore's rephrasing of it

""power the Dark Lord never knew""

Contemplate the meanings of the word *know*. Power the Dark Lord doesn't understand? Power the Dark Lord doesn't possess? Power the Dark Lord is not familiar with

""Never knew""

Witness in Ch. 56: 

""*It's all right

Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened child in his arms.

*It's right and proper to be horrified, you can wear it as a badge of honor, openly in the Sun.*

It was strange, the track of his thoughts that followed his dark side's incomprehension at the alienness of the ordinary Harry's thoughts; of all the things that his dark side associated with its own fear of death, the one thing it had never expected or imagined that it might find, was acceptance and praise and help...

*You don't have to fight alone*

And the outcome:

""*Take my hand*, and we will do this thing together...*

There was a lurch in Harry's mind

And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, shaking only slightly.

Harry knew, something that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to Dementors.""

So
""AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER
FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME WORLD.""

Which two different spirits
Harry and the original Voldemort?
Harry and his Mysterious Dark Side?
Or

This last option seems to make the most sense to me, ""merge in"" the backup from Harry, the viewpoints of one part or the other would be DRASTICALLY altered. That ""power the Dark Lord never knew"" would change the Dark Lord simply by virtue of his knowing it.

* Before Harry stopped to consider if he should actually tell anyone about Patronus 2.0

* During TSPE

Considering Harry's reactions after point 1, partially derived by the caster's natural rejection of death.

Since Patronus 2.0 destroyed a Dementor

From Harry's reaction to the Dementor before Patronus 2.0, but Harry does not feel the effect at all. The only difference that Quirell can notice here is the image Harry gives him to use as an Occulmency barrier, and it is therefore probable that this is a part of the thought that would let Harry cast Patronus 2.0.

We, and that the source of Patronus 2.0 comes from Harry's (for lack of a better word) soul. Quirell
 has the information that Harry rejects Death as the natural order
 to cast Patronus 2.0

The two issues I'm having with this theory are that Quirell would have to be quite impressive in his deductions to be able to figure this out
 still seems severely affected by the Dementors towards the end of TSPE

The only other major use that this theory has if Quirell has the knowledge of Patronus 2.0

* His closer companions (Minerva, or they just know he is a practical joker.

Albus then came out and told him that was his one chance. That Harry would never be the type of hero he had wanted to be. That knowledge broke a previous student (unnamed).

We know that he is a mysterious individual who works behind the scenes. He seems to observe more than he acts. The main supports for this statement are that we have only seen him act twice (to our knowledge)

We also know that he is very handy with Memory Charms. Every time he has appeared so far, and whatever spell changed his appearance in his encounter with Hermione, are the only spells he's been seen to use.

Finally, we are told, ""She (Hermione) saw the face beneath, and recognition sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline bursting through her."" So whoever Mr. Hat and Cloak is, we know that it is somebody whose face Hermione would have recognized during her first year of Hogwarts. That could be any of the main characters, but there is another option...

We can rule out Quirrel, and Hermione. Quirrel and Dumbledore because they were the ones H&amp;C was setting against each other, and we can rule out Blaise and Hermione because they encountered him. There is one character from the original series, who was noted as being exceptionally talented at Memory charms. Somebody who was generally not a man of action. And most importantly, somebody whom Hermione would have recognized.

For those of you who haven't pieced it out

Now, neither was Quirrel. This would also make it understandable as to why he conceals his face, when he intends to memory-wipe the people he meets anyway. He also was known for having a flair for the dramatic, and if a big, black, billowing cloak, a broad brimmed hat, then I don't know what does.

This indicates that Albus Dumbledore, not Hermione, who died before that troll. This in turn implies that Dumbledore believes that Harry will at least perceive the possibility to exchange another's life for Hermione's (since Dumbledore already received the information that a student has died at Hogwarts and cannot be altered) to be feasible enough to possibly attempt it.

I believe this gives credence to some of the theories floating around that this in fact will happen, with all those mega hints about Time that Yudkowski's been dropping in recent chapters (not to mention the blatantly obvious unlocking of the protective shell and the more subtle implications of Harry memory charming the Weasley twins, quite probably with their consent) there's no way we won't see a twisted adventure through time in the coming chapters, successful or not.

1372785497.0,1hiay8,I need some fresh tinfoil for my hat. Spoilers [88-90],c2tb34,21,4,23,"If this has been mentioned already

I have a theory regarding a combination of the importance of Harry's patronus and some of the advice which Quirrel gave Harry in Chapter 90. 


We should consider a couple of facts in sequence first. 

We are aware that someone has infiltrated Hogwarts and been casting obliviations and false memory charms to great effect. More importantly, we know that Quirrel is directing Harry to begin to learn how to cast obliviations and false memory charms, and just as importantly, he is simultaneously steering Harry away from other magical means. I think Quirrel has noticed something which we have not: Harry has been the one doing the obliviating and false memory charmings throughout the story with the aid of time travel which is unconventional even within the wizarding world.

The second thing to consider is the unexplored potential of Harry's patronus. We have seen in the story that Harry is able to not only ask questions and receive information from it


But neither of those points are the crux of this tinfoil hat theory. I believe that the whole underlying point here is that Quirrel has concluded based upon information he has experienced that Harry will at some point discover how to semi-arbitrarily travel through time and Quirrel is attempting to steer Harry towards discovering that a combination of his already invented patronus and accessible memory magic are tools enough to undo Hermione's death and that Harry otherwise discovering/inventing another means to circumvent her death causes the timeline we have seen to become an unstable time loop and consequently destroyed. This is why Harry's patronus shattered. Harry's resolution to resort to other means made it unstable.

In chapter 47 when Draco needs to know that Harry is telling the truth to believe him he pitches the idea that he can get Harry to tell him the truth under a drop of vertaserum.

In this case isn't it still possible to get Harry to tell the truth using the Imperius curse? Using the curse allows you to control any person at will so and if Harry was controlled isn't it possible to get Harry to tell anybody everything? I know people can break free of the curse through sheer will but what about cases where he willing allows himself to be cursed.

Taking this further couldn't the Imperius curse be used to get Dumbledore to testify in court or find out if he did in fact burned Narcissa alive?

Beginning in the 1940s

In the 1970s, along with his Death Eaters took control of much of Magical Britain and had supporters elsewhere as he attempted to take over the Ministry of Magic while facing opposition by Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.

However, leaving only a charred corpse and the ruins of a once happy home in his wake as the Reign of the Death Eaters came to an end in 1981.

* The Nazis have been confirmed to have carried out research into Secrets Weapons from 1930-1942 involving the Occult

* Riddle had many different influences while attending Hogwarts and may have learned much about the Muggle and Magical worlds while observing these two conflicts unfold around him. This may explain his obsession with taking over Magical Britain in general as he was likely drawing inspiration from these conflicts early on.

* Throughout his original attendance at Hogwarts it was never stated that Riddle had been adopted nor how his absence at the orphanage was explained while attending. This may imply that Riddle had multiple places of residence while attending Hogwarts

* Given Voldemort's tendency towards Third-Reich-style take over strategies, Challenger and the Pioneer probe while creating horcruxes due to the limitations on apparition capabilities.

Crouch Sr. was a rising star in the ministry during the First Wizarding War, Crouch's prestige took a nosedive just after Voldemorte's when his son was caught in the company of three known Death Eaters. The four had tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom into insanity looking for information on the Dark Lord's whereabouts. Crouch Sr. disowned his son and sentenced him to Azkaban, but his reputation never recovered and instead of becoming Minister for Magic as many had expected, he was shunted into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.

Some years later, the mother died soon after, a funeral for the wife was staged, and everyone believed Crouch Jr. and his mother were both dead.

In fact, Voldemort learned of Jr.'s location and used him to impersonate Alastor Moody during Harry's fourth year of Hogwarts.

What can we take away from this in regards to HPMOR? Firstly, as Crouch never disappeared, but it's still a possibility.

Second, but a possibility), Crouch Jr. has escaped from Azkaban some time ago and is being held in his father's house.

Crouch Jr. is among the most competent characters in canon: despite being captured at the age of 19 or so and spending the next 14 years in Azkaban or imprisoned by his father, then keeping Moody imprisoned for most of a year while impersonating him so flawlessly that he fooled Dumbledore and the rest of Hogwarts for almost the entire school year.

This is three things as far as I am aware.

1. Snape helped SPEW find bullies and then helped them win the fights.
2. Snape burned the notes he sent Hermione.
3. The conversation he had with the girl he used in the SA arc. Probably genuinely unguarded since he was about to obliviate her. 

One could be seen as helping Hermione build character or skill or whatever

As for two, but Snape burned his evidence. This is not someone interested in helping Hermione. 

Three does not really help either way as far as I can tell. It is mostly Snape expressing regret for the past and trying to figure out the prophecy. 

That is not a lot of evidence, but canon Snape was only Harry's protector our of respect for Lilly's sacrifice. If he really did have a rage inducing revelation in that conversation it could be enough to cause him to abandon that role. If he abandons that role the obvious thing for him would be to go back to fighting for the dark lord who will soon be returning. Which means fighting against Harry and his allies.

If we assume that Snape was plotting against Hermione in the SA arc then he also becomes a prime suspect for being H&amp;C. Hermione was mind raped and the Taboo Tradeoffs plot was set in motion immediately after Quirrell's intervention in the final SA battle.

Evidence: 
A) """"And Lily would tell me no, or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for""  -&gt; Lily was aware of a prophesy that her choices could lead to the end of the world. Note the additional detail of a centaur, which would have meant nothing to petunia, but we know are prophetic figures. Dumbledore was teaching at Hogwarts and was an extremely important figure, if not Headmaster at the time. It seems quite believable he was made aware of the situation.

B) ""she gave in. She told me it was dangerous, but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people were nice to me""
+ 
""The yellowing pages seemed to be describing something called a potion of eagle's splendour, You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.

""I see them

Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. ""The ones in this handwriting, ""were written by your mother. And the ones in this handwriting,"" moving his finger to indicate the first scrawl, ""were written by me. I would turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they had the most amazing fights.""

Eagle's splendour is Dungeons and Dragons reference to a potion that enhances beauty. Dumbledore admits he helped lily construct a potion to enhance petunia's beauty. Furthermore, otherwise, what motive would he have for intervening? And why would he happen to show this particular intervention to Harry, if there were a large number of other random interventions? Checkhov's gun.

C) Dumbledore has received professor trelawney's prophesy concerning  ""HE IS COMING"", he knew the prophesy in question was about Harry.

D) Dumbledore warns Hermione that there are dire consequences if things go awry with Harry:
""Hermione Granger
To some extent, but in reality this is quite imaginable for hermione, given the historical information available at that time. I consider this fairly weak evidence though.

E) Dumbledore persuades Harry not to enter the Department of Mysteries: 
""Harry was staring directly at Albus. ""Can I go to this Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The original tone of voice might be helpful

Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses as the old wizard slowly shook his head. ""I think that would be unwise

One very prominent possibility here is that Dumbledore is aware of other prophesies relating to Harry, which would at least be a good shot of being the case, but if dumbledore thought that wasn't the case, then all the less reason to keep harry out). However, if Dumbledore believed that Harry was the subject of the prophesy, he would most certainly want to keep him out, which he did.

(I'd also note that it seems bizarre for Dumbledore to think it possible that he is the Dark Lord

This all leaves the question of Dumbledore's motive for bringing about the end of the world. Perhaps, when faced with extreme uncertainty, Dumbledore resorts to doing what he considers to be the right thing (giving Harry as happy a life as possible, helping petunia, etc.)",,False,t5_2t5xf,True

Unlike the previous incident, we should assume the Headmaster would not hesitate to use an extra six-hour time window. 

Yet at the time Hermione was killed Dumbledore did not receive any warning from his future self, he should have been told by a future self: ""Miss Granger was will be killed by a troll today, get back to Hogwarts now."" 

Well, and how did the troll find her). The rational choice for the Headmaster after he saw Hermione dying would be go back in time ASAP before being told any specific information about the troll and the staff's reaction to it. We have no idea, whether this was the same troll in canon and brought into Hogwarts for the same purpose, if not (most likely), given it was a large, noisy, dangerous and unaccounted creature at Hogwarts, but had to allow it running freely and kill a cat then a student for some reason. Unless of course


Now from the plotter's stand-point, hide it for more than six hours before its existence could be confirmed by anyone else, so that no one could go back in time and catch him with the troll. Then set it free remotely leaving no trace (magical or not), and had it locate and kill the target in a very short time-period. The difficult parts are: how to conceal it for as long as six hours and have it accomplish the killing quickly. He could possibly paralyze the troll and transfigure the whole creature into something small and unnoticeable (well this takes some powerful magic obviously, but not impossible as we have seen a desk becoming a pig), and have this small thing hidden on a path where he knew Miss Granger will cross (or just casually put a book in Hermione's bag and sustain the transfiguration until she's absolutely alone). This plan solves the above difficulties, yet it is inconsistent with what had happened: mainly one thing, suppose the plotter intended the troll to do some assassination, having the troll encounter Filch and the cat almost ruined the plan. Harry's 1000 possible things he could have done are also 1000 different ways the plotter's plan could've easily failed. It's possible due to limitation in resources, instead of just hear the news of her dead. This would be a lot more difficult than simply killing her

1370540722.0,1fsy7b,The Litch King.,saitselkis,28,13,74,"Ok

First the WoW bit.

The Lich King is not a necessarily evil being, and current, Lich Kings were paladins who sacrificed themselves to steering the will of the scourge to its least damaging directions, rather than leading a full on assault against the other forces of the world. Over time that willpower is corrupted, and the lich begins to feel the same mindless destructiveness as his minions until he leads a charge against the world en masse. Then a new champion is called to throw down the lich king and assume his role of controlling the scourge, a supposedly endless cycle.

Relevant points

1 There are anti muggle factions within the wizard community created of simple ignorant prejudice.

2 Those factions have access to magic

3 These factions seek each other, who would wish violence on those they view as lesser or persecutors. (think ss, kkk, wbbc, etc.)

Now, and their opposites. My theory, is that Tom Riddle sought to, in his admittedly ignorant youth (Ch 18) become a dark wizard, defined by not conforming to the status quo. He voluntarily donned the mantel of Voldermort to take control of the factions that would have changed the makeup and landscape of Magical Britain, who would otherwise run rampant, in order to steer the war towards defeat. He used magical means and his minions to kill enough muggles and sow chaos to create a black-and-white delineation of alliances.The magnitude of his transgressions carefully calculated to make sure that anyone affiliated with him would have to completely commit to his insane and barbaric notions, leaving them shattered and leaderless. He chooses a pair of the greatest champions against him (per prophecy) to be his undoing

Years later he hears of his old factions realigning, ingratiates himself to the headmaster of Hogwarts in order to preen the boy he allowed to live to be not black and white, but grey. Allowing him to fully see both the evils and virtues of each opposing side and try to unite the two under their more virtuous characteristics.

Readers are generally interpreting this as a hint that revealing the secret of the Dark Mark triggered another effect of the spell, of course--Severus could have just happened to remember something right at that moment, and realize some subtlety to Voldemort's past actions.  But I think the ""second layer"" interpretation is the most likely.  So what was it, and why was it there?

I've been puzzled for a while by the Dark Mark. Characters talk about it as though it had loyalty-enforcing properties, a permanent tattoo is a credible loyalty *signal*, and the Mark seems to allow bearers to voluntarily meet up together more easily, but it still isn't living up to the way it's discussed.  And, I mean, if canon!Hermione can hex everyone so that they'll be permanently disfigured if they betray her...

It seems clear that Riddle was either unable or unwilling to build a ""betray Voldemort -&gt; die horribly"" or ""betray Voldemort -&gt; get mindwiped and minionized"" trigger into the Mark.  I can think of a few possible reasons for this.

  * Fine-tuning exactly how much disloyalty counted as ""betrayal"" would burn through too many Death Eaters.
  * At the time he invented the Dark Mark
  * Magically-enforced loyalty always requires a large permanent sacrifice no matter how clever you are
  * He wanted Death Eaters to be able to sincerely defect

So, each of which most likely indicates betrayal, and trigger off of them. As Monroe, he could warn defectors not to do any of those specific things.  One of them, naturally, would be ""gleefully revealing everything you know about the Dark Mark as soon as the prohibition is lifted.""

As for what the trigger does...I still don't understand why it isn't ""die horribly"" or ""become a brainwashed minion of Voldemort, he owes his loyalty to.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1356112618.0,,

My theory is thus:

Snape set up the entire meeting with Lesath with the express intention of forcing Harry to dwell on how horrible azkaban is. He knew that Harry would empathise with Lesath and that Lesath would beg Harry to save Belatrix. Harry may have discarded these thoughts but afterwards Snape put him in an exceptionally dark mood by making him work out that his parents were horrible people as teenagers. A person in a dark mood thinks about dark things. The darkest idea Harry has been recently exposed to? Azkaban. Harry now contemplates Azkaban in detail and has already had the idea of saving Belatrix from it planted in his mind.

Not long afterwards Harry gets a chance to save her guilt-free because Quirrelmort gives some unprovable hypothesis that she was forced to be evil by a dark ritual. Harry

I started typing out my own response but it ended up being far longer than I intended

As /u/pedanterrific pointed out in a reply

*Muggle* - A person incapable of using magic
*Squib* - A person incapable of using magic

All magical people must have 2 copies of the recessive magical gene

In trying to find an answer

* All people capable of using magic have 2 copies of the recessive magic gene.
* Squibs exist
* Squibs are realtively rare(1).
* Even pure-blood families can produce squibs.
* Some muggles produce magical children.
* Such children are uncommon

(1) *I believe we only learned of 3 specific squibs in the regular HP canon - Filch
(2) *In HPMoR,000 students at the school, which means that muggleborns make up somewhere around 7% of the student population in HPMoR.*

It seems to me that there are two main issues.  First

In order to get an estimate of the level of magic-muggle infidelity, then the magical gene needs to be common enough in the muggle female population that however much cheating actually happens is enough for ~7% of all magical children in Britain to be muggleborn.

Without wanting to bog the thread down with the actual numbers, on the other hand, *is* a sufficient explanation for the existence of muggleborns.  It requires only a low abundance of the gene among the muggle population, and we don't need to invent an inflated level of infidelity among magical people to explain the existence of muggleborns.  Occam's razor suggests that muggleborns really are the children of muggles.

We also note a trend among magical people to completely separate themselves from the muggle world.  With this and the fact that it is unnecessary to think of infidelity to explain muggleborns

Which finally brings us to squibs.  I will assume that witches are not substantially more or less likely to cheat than wizards.  If we do accept a low rate of witch-muggle infidelity, seem consistent with the idea that squibs are actually the result of cheating witches.  It seems unlikely that squibs would come about 'naturally' if magic were genetic.

Clearly none of this is definitive

I think that the evidence in favor of this is pretty damn strong

Chapter 85 shows Harry starting to make a list of suspects, plus it would probably make him more sympathetic to Dumbledore.

We have seen the level of preparedness in Quirrell’s plots before. When he thought that no one would ever know that Bellatrix had been taken from Azkaban, but who.

If he could pull it off, that would be the end of any chance of Harry ever working with Dumbledore again.

There are two problems with framing Dumbledore that I can see. The first is that Dumbledore himself would know that he didn’t do it, say, Robert Jugson had been the one who appeared to have cast the blood cooling charm on Draco, things would be different. It would weaken the blood purist faction. But a mudblood witch killing the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy doesn’t do that. Lucius would crush her without expending any political capital, and afterwards the blood purists would have more supporters, not less.

The other obvious target is Severus Snape. Harry already dislikes Snape, plus some other faked evidence. We have already seen Harry come up with the logical hypothesis that whoever was leaving the notes for Hermione was doing so to setup what happened later. Snape will be in the unenviable position of trying to convince Harry and Dumbledore that some of the evidence against him is fake, and the rest isn’t what it looks like.

Snape also has a plausible motive to kill Draco and frame Hermione. He has decided to break with Dumbledore

Harry believing that Snape was responsible for what happened wouldn’t be as good as him blaming Dumbledore, he would certainly not be allowed to stay in Hogwarts. And in any case it would take suspicion off of Quirrell himself.

Does anyone have any other suggestion for who Quirrell might frame? Or any other ideas on how he might deflect suspicion from himself? Is there anyone who thinks that Quirrell doesn’t have some sort of a plan

- Yes. Magical creatures can have offspring which do not have magical properties (that is to say they do not interact with the source of magic). This means that whatever genetic marker is used to establish a link to the source of magic is not specific to humans because it is present in all magical creatures (which means they can randomly mutate to not have it and therefore produce ""squibs""). This indicates that the creators of the source of magic were not humans or they would surely have used a marker specific to humans (and also specific to *them*).

- No. All magical creatures always have magical properties no matter what mutations may arise. This indicates that to interact with the source of magic does not require the presence of a single gene
The programming for such a system would be as follows:

    If organism's genome is 99% identicle to genome labeled ""Pheonix"" apply the following properties:

     -When the tears of this organism are in direct contact with damaged tissue repair the damaged tissue.
 
    -When the neuron cluster labeled ""A"" is active teleport the organism to the location encoded in neuron cluster labeled ""B"".

    -When the organism produces sound by manipulation of its larynx search for organisms which match 99% of the genome labeled ""Human"". Of found ""Humans"" Search brain patterns for signs of altruism and of greed. If more signs of altruism are found produce emotion labeled ""Happiness"". If more signs of greed are found produce emotion labeled ""Fear"".

This would indicate that the creators of the source of magic were humans. This is because a magical creatures connection to the source of magic is determined in a different way than to humans.

Harry has deduced that magic is some sort of computery thing that pays attention to a genetic maker, the presence of both muggleborns *and* squibs. Think about it; it's never specified that the gene for magic is dominant or recessive. There are problems with both.

If the gene for magic is dominant than muggleborns would be impossible (but squibs wouldn't) because having one copy of the gene would make you a wizard, because wizards would have two copies on the gene, and couldn't pass anything except magic to their kids. There is, however, another simple genetic solution.

Imagine that, and one that gives you the ability to input commands. Magic doesn't work unless you have both of these. One is dominant, and one is recessive. This allows for both squibs and muggleborns: A muggleborn has two parents with the recessive console-opening gene and one parent with the dominant command-gene, or perhaps two parents with the dominant gene. Regardless, she has the genes to cast magic. A squib, on the other hand, is missing a gene; his parents both had only one copy of the dominant gene

I've heard the theory that the single recessive gene for magic can be flipped into the non-magic gene by the (presumably radioactive) check ups of the source of magic, then you would also expect to see abnormally high rates of other mutations and genetic diseases among squibs.

An Alternate Hypothesis: Dumbledore will be ousted as Headmaster of Hogwarts

Harry has proposed a plan to Lucius and Draco concerning his next steps should House Malfoy and House Potter unite. What information do we know about this plan?

1. Harry was reluctant to tell Lucius + Draco of it in advance (Harry waited until it was clear Draco could not convince his father to join with Harry independently of the plan)
2. Lucius finds the plan to be a strong incentive to join with Harry
3. The plan involves the noble houses of Potter, and Bones at the least acting in concert. Possibly other Houses aligned with Lucius would be involved as well.
4. Dumbledore will very possibly oppose the plan
5. The idea would appear suspicious if Lucius proposed it
6. We know this idea is compatible with the idea that Draco could be ruler of Magical Britain by the end of his term at Hogwarts.

Additional Facts:
1. We know that the Wizengamot is very closely balanced between Dumbledore's faction and Lucius's. The same is true for the Board of Governors of Hogwarts.
2. We know Noble Families are voters in the Wizengamot. These same parties likely have influence for the Board of Governors
3. We know Neville's grandmother
4. We know Amelia Bones is supportive a strong central figure for the light and as chief auror
5. We know Dumbledore opposed Quirrel's call for a stronger
6. We know Dumbledore has lost a great deal of face by having a student die in Hogwarts. This is certainly a major issue

Reasoning:

1. The interest in obtaining support from other Noble Houses suggests a Wizengamot vote is involved (we have no evidence that Neville's grandmother, which suggests that small imbalances caused by a few members changing their votes can cause changes in the outcome of votes.

2. How can Harry have any confidence in convincing Longbottom and Bones (assuming this is referring to the house seats, and with respect to Amelia, he perhaps has some conception of Amelia through Susan and the Wizengamot trial. Alternately, with respect to an ousting of Dumbledore, Harry is possibly aware through Susan of Amelia's hardline support of the direct confrontation of abuse that has been permitted inside Hogwarts (bullying). Similarly, we know that both can imagine Neville or Susan being in Hermione's same position, and might be far more sympathetic to appeals to restore Hogwarts to its role as a neutral middleground

3. The set of actions Harry is capable of and interested in, our understanding of Lucius's goals revolve around weakening Dumbledore. This can occur via weakening his position at Hogwarts (via the Board of Governors or having Dumbledore ousted as Headmaster) or weakening his political roles.

To play the tabletop version of Mafia there are two teams. 

Players are secretly assigned roles: either mafia, all of the surviving players debate the identities of the mafia and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the mafia have been eliminated, or until the mafia outnumber the townspeople. A typical game starts with seven townspeople and two mafiosi.

Getting back to the title

Time constraints limit the complexity of the tabletop version which is why I like the computer version more.  In the computer version everyone gets a role which is beneficial to their team and some neutral players are thrown in to add even more misinformation.

All role abilities can be found here:

This game requires the game starcraft2 to be played.  It is a custom game using the starcraft 2 engine.

1343819320.0,xi19m,Rewriting Chapters 1-2,endym,27,12,59,"HPMoR's beginning is the most poorly-written part of the story

The Ch. 1-2 plot is overly linear and to-the-point — very little of that zigzagging clash of vibrant personalities we soon grow to expect. It's as though the author is rushing through the requisite setup out of boredom with all things nonmagical — a tragic error, a unique opportunity to flesh out Harry and his parents in a context mundane enough to bring their personalities, rather than the setting, into the foreground. But instead we get completely flat depictions of Harry's folks, and even Harry seems like a caricature, absent foreshadowing of the more interesting traits that will come to define him (e.g., his utopian humanism, his mischievousness...).

I'd like to hear other assessments of the chapters

1. First maxim of storytelling: Show

2. To make the narrative less dull and linear, and seeing someone ill will give Harry a chance to ponder how absurd and wasteful death is (hinting at his most defining motivation later on), and will give Petunia a chance to offer some healing crystals!

3. That’s right, gives Harry and his dad something *important* to argue with Petunia about, and offers us a more natural segue into her backstory. (When offered one of Petunia’s ‘healing crystals’ later, McGonagall can remark that it is ordinary quartz, giving Harry a chance to note the misleading nature of categories like ‘magic.’)

4. Give Harry’s dad some real dialogue. His personality’s fine; he just needs time to show he’s not a bland, hinting at whence Harry gets his habit of lecturing people about their cognitive biases. And it would be lovely to see him nerdishly bonding with Harry in the car, e.g., giving him a pop verbal exam or answering Harry’s endless strings of questions with impromptu lessons about old-growth forests and macroeconomics. That would be *adorable*. At the same time, Harry’s dad is a lot older than Harry, more set in his ways. He’d seem a bit more human if he subtly demonstrated that he still, on some level, even after seeing what he himself would characterize as good evidence. Humans are *astoundingly* good at cognitive dissonance of that sort.

5. The family returns home to find their house stuffed full of letters. Harry learns that his father has been burning scores of letters from people he takes to be con artists. (Note the parallels with the Dursleys; two people can do the same thing, angry, and chaotic, given that to all appearances Petunia suddenly seems to be having a psychotic breakdown. Harry should even help gang up on his mother.

6. As the fighting gets ugly, causing Harry to fall — but, somehow, not hurt himself. At this point, he’s still sure it’s just a prank, but is starting to notice his confusion. And then he walks inside and sees a self-proclaimed witch…. These incremental anomalies help prime Harry much better than leaping right into ‘oh, this woman claims she’s a witch’ for taking the hypothesis even somewhat seriously. At the same time, which is crucial to establishing his character – Harry *never once* acts in later chapters like how he acts in Ch. 1-2 as they’re presently writ.

7. Keep Chapter 2 mostly the same, reality, science, magic. He’s interrupted by his mother, whom he proceeds to interrogate at length about whatever she half-remembers of the magical world. Petunia warmly offers what she can, and the two are interrupted only by the pre-dawn stirrings of birdsong.

Obviously this is just a sketch, perspectives. Mr. Verres is too set in his ways, Petunia is too credulous, and Harry puts too much faith in authorities and in the domain-generality of his father's rationality.

Notably, which resolves what Eliezer calls the single biggest problem of HPMoR — the fact that Harry suffers no major losses in the early chapters, steamrolling over everyone else and every obstacle. Ch. 1-2 is a perfect time for Harry to suffer a big loss, since he's invested his whole life into a magic-free world-view. Sure, he can be more open-minded than his father, but he should still be rather more shellshocked by the whole affair than he lets on. It will then count as at least an embarrassment, rather than a triumph, far more believable,self,chaos

**Speculation 1**
Harry will (did?) travel back to before Hermione died. When McGonagall unlocked his time turner, Yudkowsky said, ['Intentional'](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hc6x6/spoiler_discussion_thread_for_ch_8889/caswa7m). What was being intended, I do not know. But it does appear to suggest that something was amiss regarding the flow of events.


**Speculation 2**
The ultimate showdown between Harry and Quirrell (in whatever form that takes) will involve Dementors. Quirrell is particularly weak to them and cannot cast a Patronous to shield himself from these indestructible, but somewhere in a discussion, a commentator called Harry's failure to destroy the Dementors while he was in Azkaban a 'missed moment of awesome' and Yudkowsky responded with something to the effect of 'Just be patient'.


**Speculation 3**
Harry is the bad guy. Not the villain, as an intelligent rationalist actually could defeat Quirrellmort. If Harry had been canon! Harry facing MOR Voldemort, he would have died. Quickly. The third and fourth prophecies are basically the same 'He is coming...' and 'He is here...'. Both occurred at turning points in Harry's path to what he will become/do. The first point was after Harry's conversation with the sorting hat in which Harry chose Ravenclaw. A conversation in which the hat warned 
*This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don’t be so sure that there will
be other choices beyond this one. There is no road-sign set
of your last chance to turn back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse
others? It may be that your fate is already sealed
thing.*
The hat's full warning can be considered another pseudo prophecy


**Bonus Speculation**
The Weasley twins did it. All of it. Or, there is no such thing as going too far. They long ago decided that learning memory charms would come in handy. A memory charm can by itself be a good joke, and many of the more complex plans require certain people to forget certain things. They are now extremely proficient with Obliviation and planting false memories. They orchestrated the whole Rita Skeeter situation by memory charming the right people, and may have even maneuvered Harry into requesting their help in the first place- or at least into thinking he did. They arranged for Hermine to 'die' as an elaborate plan to make their head of house resign. The wards think the defense professor did it because, well, they are the defense professor...They are both animagi. Small ones who are able to spy on others. Very much like Rita Skeeter. They managed to fly/crawl into the circle when Dumbledore was establishing Quirrell as the defense professor and are now considered 'The Defense Professor' themselves. They routinely use their professor status to Obliviate other students and move events as they see fit... acting as a mysterious figure known as 'Hat and Cloak'.",,self,,

&gt; ""You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet lived

&gt; Well... yeah, you can read my mind anyway.

&gt; ""To the extent you really believe that... you must equally believe that you could be the most terrible Dark Lord the world has ever known.""

&gt; Destruction is always easier than creation. **Easier to tear things apart**, I must also have the potential to accomplish still greater evil... But I won't do that.

&gt; ""Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven? What is the real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and be happier there? What is your true fear?""

&gt; **I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I... fail...**

&gt; **""What happens if you fail?""**

&gt; **Something terrible...**

&gt; ""What happens if you fail?""

&gt; I don't know!

&gt; ""Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?""

&gt; **I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!**

&gt; There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's mind.

&gt; ""You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies...""

&gt; No, it's something more, it comes from somewhere else, **I know there's something out there to be afraid of, some disaster I have to stop...**

&gt; ""How could you possibly know about something like that?""

&gt; Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: NO

&gt; Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:

&gt; ""**So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, is certain failure, and that failure means the loss of everything. You believe that in your heart of hearts. You know all the reasons for doubting this belief, and they have failed to move you.**""

&gt; Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw strengthens the coldness

&gt; ""**This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don't be so sure that there will be other choices beyond this one. There is no road-sign set

So, and while he may not wish to think of himself as the sort of person who chooses the easy option, he has in fact done this in the past - using the Time Turner to get himself out of a sticky situation, consequences be damned. Has Harry matured and learned from his mistakes sufficiently to not take the easy route in future? If not, then he may well be on course to becoming the Dark Lord the prophecy foretells.

Secondly, the world might end. Or could it even refer to a threat to the world from Dementors/Death?

Ever since it was clear that Quirrell was playing many roles my theory about his periodic spacing out is due to him taking control over another body somewhere.  He might only have the tiniest amount of awareness over Quirrell's body when in this state which is why it seems like he can be startled out of it.  The interesting question that arises from this theory is to try to find a character that's appeared in the story so far but only when Quirrell wasn't around or while he was a zombie.  The situation of course becomes much more complicated if he just directs someone's actions temporarily instead of having to dictate everything

My suspects
* The Defense Professor  
-Because... It is clear throughout the story that he is trying to bring Harry over to the Dark Side and had noticed Hermione was strongly anchoring him on the Light Side. He also tried to get rid of her non-violently by sending her away after the plan to send her to prison didn't work (I'm assuming the incident with Draco and the troll were caused by the same person). He was also the one responsible in canon.  
-On the other hand... Releasing a troll on a huge non-Euclidean castle doesn't seem like a very efficient way of going about killing a specific student
* Mr. Hat-and-Cloak   
-Because... As we know so little about him, he has already shown to be able to circumvent Hogwarts' wards (only a professor can Obliviate students) so it wouldn't be a stretch for him to go around others.  
-On the other hand... It's all a little too vague while we are still speculating on who he is.  
* Lucius Malfoy  
-Because... Revenge, the troll could also have killed Harry (whom he might blame for exposing his son to dangerous ideas) and, even if it didn't kill anyone, would still be a political blow against Dumbledore.  
-On the other hand... Draco didn't die and Lucius has had plenty of time to see this is obviously someone else's plot. And though he would never admit it
* Dumbledore  
-Because... Maybe he thought Voldemort would try to exploit her as vulnerability of Harry's. Maybe he thought it would push Harry towards taking the enemy seriously. Maybe he faked it. Maybe he is insane. None of these are really strong evidence, preventing the Hogwarts' wards her sudden injuries (he only arrived after she died), circumventing whatever special enchantments he put on her personally and preventing the other professors from calling (I'm just speculating, but it seems strange that Minerva, Flitwick and Snape didn't try to send him a Patronus as soon as they heard about the troll). Also, he is the only one we've seen who knew about the map.  
-On the other hand... No matter how fallible he is
* Snape  
-Because... It's hard to come up with a good reason why, like Quirrell did in canon.  
-On the other hand... The impression I got from the Self-Actualization arc was that he was deliberately trying to help Hermione and that his faltering loyalty was not to Dumbledore in general
* Some other character that hasn't appeared in story yet

I barely even lurk on this subreddit, I regret not reading EY's sequences and rereading the fic and discovering it myself. I know, thats silly and vain, but this is a fic, not a real problem we ""need"" to solve as a community. Not that I don't think all your collected efforts are awesome, I imagine EY must feel great about the fact that so many people are throwing themselves at his constructed problem and taking interest in his theories as a result.

I guess i want to learn by doing so to speak

Otherwise


**Things that confuse me in HPMOR**


**CH1**
The first few lines : 
Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver

(black robes

...blood spills out in litres

This is the first confusing bit in HPMOR. It does not really fall within the ""more confused by fiction
Theory based on CH90 [SPOILER](#s ""this is Harry's spell


Petunia's changes : Ofcourse this bit is vital to this fic's existence - if this divergent point from canon did not happen
However
Even with Petunias threat of suicide..? Not sure if that makes sense.


Third
Harry is convinced magic is real. [SPOILER](#s ""Or ""some part"" of Harry is. This part is probably Harry's dark side. There seems to be no reason why this 
very rational Harry, sure, want to test it, sure. But he 
_believes_. In CH90 hindsight, or brain pattern information back in time. His soul assimilates with cute!rational!Harry to make our hero. However, nothing changes so time travel apparently sucks?"")
Maybe HPMOR is a tragedy

So

**CH2** - End of Spoiler Tags 
I think the work of making ALL these tags when the title is so clearly labled is cruel work. Is it OK to skip them?
Err

""Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything.""


So this is a line from CH90 that refers to Harry's resolution to save Hermoine at any cost. Excited to reread the chapter to
see what EY wants me to read with this ominous line in mind


""not to mention that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of neurons

And then a woman turned into a cat

So this brings us to CH90 again
how the world works and discard anything as too silly
thing where Harry sits by Hermione : ""There was a burst of something that was magic and also more, all spoken in a single cry that was Hermione""
Harry still decides to cryo her
horcruxes are definetly on the table

The only other thing in this chapter is Minerva's thing at the end where she's saying she wont take Harry to Diagon Alley until the end of summer
to keep him from destroying the England or something. This is really really strange
we can chalk it up to being just EY getting a bit carried away.


**CH3**


""I had the strangest feeling that I knew him..."" Harry rubbed his forehead. ""And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand."" Like meeting someone who had been a friend, but Harry couldn't find words.""

So I have this crackpot theory based on Lily helping Petunia - the warnings Lily received must have been very vague since she went ahead and changed things, just CH88, 89, 90, and my reread so far, as well as my
vague memory from my previous readthru. It may be the stupidest theory ever
to figure out themselves in their reread. [SPOILER](#s ""So I think Harry's time-travelled twice. Once
and once more to assume the role Madam Bones peggs Quirrel for. So I think Quirrel is not Voldemort

I have a tentative diagnosis from a doctor and she said to try keeping a food diary to nail down what's causing problems. However, when I tried to do a similar sort of logging earlier, I ended up with a lot of simple text data with only a few incidents. Also, my doctor and I already know that the actual event/""keyword"" is probably going to include something like ""ate out at XYZ restaurant instead of ABC restaurant"".

It seems that, in case it actually results in a paradox.

was as good as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good as the Founders of Hogwarts.”

That's right. Dark!Harry is possibly a reincarnation of Merlin or something to that extent. We do not know the upper bounds of Merlin's power. Word is he managed to alter the very Laws of Magic themselves (Interdict of Merlin)

Of course

* Merlin existed in the first place
* Merlin was indeed as powerful as people say (or at least more powerful than the Hat.)
* Merlin either was evil or somehow only his evil part ended up in Harry
* Merlin had some reason to put his soul into a child born ~2000 years after him, Dumbledore would say it would be consistent with him being a Dark Lord.

The Big Story in MoR is the source of magic itself. Wizarding history is mute on the subject; hardly anything is known about the centuries before Merlin and Atlantis is only a name. EY has postulated, the creation of the time-lost Atlantians. But what do we know about MoR magic?

So far as I can see

&gt;Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. ""You can't DO that!""

&gt;""It's only a Transfiguration

&gt;""You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?""

&gt;Professor McGonagall's lips were twitching harder now. ""Magic.""

&gt;""Magic isn't enough to do that! You'd have to be a god!""

Harry is quite correct: to do what wizards and witches routinely do, space, and time, requires functional omniscience and omnipotence. In short, it requires the Singularity Event that EY works towards; the creation of a computer/AI capable of leveling itself up to infinite computational power. It is a short step from infinite computational power to infinite knowledge of how the universe works to mapping the universe (or at least our local neighborhood) down to the subatomic level in real time and thence to full omnipotence, the power to manipulate all of time and space.

This God Machine would not, a genie only capable of carrying out instructions. It will respond to a user-request like ""turn me into a cat,"" but it will not turn a user into a cat because it thinks a cat would be a fine thing for that user to be. A God Machine that did more would rob humanity of its free will. Where this God Machine is and what it looks like is anybody's guess; it may be purely a psychic or hyperspace or quantum construct, not existing in the physical world of our senses at all.

There is

Lost Atlantis may in fact be a pure myth, to the point that interaction with the past results in closed cause-and-effect loops. You can't change history, but you can participate in it, even provide your past self with knowledge/directions. It boggles Harry's mind, but it is strongly implied that, while an event can cause itself (thus Harry's game), the cause of the event cannot simply disappear or be overwritten.

So what if the Magical Singularity that created the God Machine that powers all magic has yet to actually happen? There is no reason the God Machine cannot come into existence in the future and still affect the distant past (the six-hour limit on Time Turners smacks of Arbitrary Limit when prophecies can go back for centuries). The God Machine may reach back to the distant past to be the source of magic for the Wizarding World that later creates the Magical Singularity and the God Machine.

Which would imply that

It would certainly fulfill the prophecy ""He will end the world.""

1374411682.0,1iqy5n,Paradox Prevention Hypothesis (spoilers up to chapter 17),TimTravel,12,1,3,"I have a hypothesis for how time travel works in HPMOR somewhat based on what EY mentioned in a comment I've lost track of. I believe it can explain the way paradox prevention works in a more satisfying way than any other hypothesis I've considered.

---
The Consistent Universe Probability Distribution Hypothesis

There is a probability distribution of configurations of 4-dimensional universes. If time travel were not involved, which is roughly the probability of the matter not spontaneously ceasing to exist due to quantum noise or any other reason in a particular instant. If the past is inconsistent with the future person going back (they never showed up), then the probability mass of that universe will be essentially zero. The Auditors from Discworld sampled Graham's number of universes according to this distribution. How did they sample the distribution? Very well, thank you. Perfectly, in fact.

By the anthropic principle, there is no ""if you cause a paradox then something very bad will happen"". It's simply, ""you cannot cause a paradox"". Best of all, the regular rules of the universe apply during each time loop. Time loops in which people act out of character are as unlikely as people acting out of character outside a time loop, unless people acting out of character is an event with high probability conditioned on paradoxes not happening, which could be plausible depending on the situation.

---
Paradox Threat Algorithm

Suppose you want to factor a large integer n. Receive from your future self the factorization of n as two integers. Confirm by a reliable method that their product is exactly n. If it is, in order for it to work, there has to be a proof of correctness you can confirm yourself with very very high probability. If you get a statement like ""this Turing machine will never halt"", then you can't enforce the universe's honesty via paradox because you have no way of knowing whether the answer was correct. This algorithm therefore immediately extends to any problem in the intersection of NP and co-NP, because that is exactly the set of decision problems which have short, polynomial time checkable correctness proofs whether the answer is yes or no. You can also compute the solutions to problems in PSPACE, using an Arthur-Merlin interactive proof that is too complicated to discuss here. See the paper ""IP = PSPACE"" by Adi Shamir for details if you are interested and are somewhat familiar with theoretical computer science.

Strictly speaking, of course, in which case it would just give you something you could have done without time travel).

In chapter 17, which he did not show to Harry. Instead of getting the factors, Harry receives the message ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"". He then stops the experiment and does not attempt it or any other like it again. The question is why he failed to factor.

Hypothesis 1: the universe can overwrite itself, preventing that timeline from happening. This does not explain why he did not explain to himself why he should stop.

Hypothesis 2: there is a mechanism in either the universe or with time-turners themselves that detects and prevents such meddling. This certainly explains it, etc, etc.

Hypothesis 3: the consistent universe probability distribution hypothesis is true, and the number of possible messages is large. The higher the number of messages is, the stronger my claim will be, so conservatively assume that the prior probability of (the message consists of two integers and the smaller is prime and the higher is exactly floor(18429 / firstFactor)) is essentially 1. There are floor(sqrt(18429)) = 135 initial candidates for the lower number, of which 32 are prime, so there are at least 32 plausible messages he could get before taking paradox prevention into account.

The prior probability of getting the right message is at most 1/32. If there is an event with probability significantly higher than 1/32 that would prevent the experiment from proceeding, so the distribution is conditioned on (an event with prior probability about 31/32) not happening. Even events with low prior probability have high posterior probability if they prevent the paradox from happening and are more likely than the success of the paradox threat algorithm. It intuitively seems to me that the probability of getting the ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"" message is actually much lower than 1/32, so this line of reasoning doesn't immediately seem hopeful. However, consider this: the result of the message was that ""[Harry] resolved not to do any more truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least fifteen years old."". It is quite likely that if the experiment had been a success, he would have attempted other paradox threats, because if they work then they are a powerful tool, and there's no reason not to use a useful tool unless there's a reason not to use it. The message he got prevented all future experiments Harry might have attempted, in order to be plausible, so this analysis seems to work.

[""Spoiler TSPE""] (#s At at least one point in the story, or it could be that time turners made him write the message because that's how they work.)

---
There is a certain line of reasoning used by many fans here (and also a few characters in the story) that is incorrect if the CUPD hypothesis holds. I will illustrate an out-of-story example to avoid spoilers of the later chapters

Steve and Mary each have time turners. Steve wants to steal a bag of money with a dollar sign on it from Mary. Steve plans to observe the room with the money bag until an hour passes without Mary being in the room. Once that happens, so her going back would be a paradox, which is essentially impossible. Mary has the following policy: she regularly checks if the money bag has been stolen, and if it has, she will go back in time and check on the bag of money to catch whoever attempted to steal it.

The critical fact is that the CONJUNCTION of Mary checking on the money and Steve checking on her not checking on the money is the paradox. It can be resolved by Mary failing to go back, Mary changing her mind, one of them breaking or losing their time turner, etc. Even if these events are likely enough, it's certainly not obviously the case that Steve will win just because the paradox prevention event happens later in that case. Assuming no third candidate event happens, the two main prevention events will happen with probability proportional to their relative probability.

---
An Experiment

There is a simple test Harry could do to distinguish between hypothesis 2 and 3. Harry sits in a room for one hour and watches the door to see if his future self arrives. He then leaves the room and goes back in time by one hour. He flips a coin a number of times small enough to avoid risk of disastrous paradox prevention events, Harry enters the room if and only if he does NOT remember seeing himself enter the room. In short: he causes a paradox with a ""safety valve"" event which happens with probability 1/32.

If the artificial mechanism hypothesis is true, the prior probability Harry fails to go back and follow the policy should be significantly smaller than 1/32. However, if that happens, it would also be evidence of the CUPD rules preventing the paradox threat in a different way.

If Steves always win the above sort of game

     2		10
     5		81
    11		45

* So

* Not many people haven't at least looked into Eliezer since reading the fic (5)

* Most people (34) found it through a variety of random websites - most popular of those were reddit (12) and TV Tropes (7). Of the others, and 5 through LessWrong or Yudkowsky.net.

* As to whether the better chapters came earlier or later in the fic

* Many chapters were nominated as favourites by just one or two respondents, and 11 chose [spoiler](/s ""the Patronus 2.0 creation"") in Ch45. (It's worth mentioning that this was for many a hard choice and I'm sure there are plenty of moments that would have been promoted up if you could have chosen more than one. But sometimes asking tough questions produces interesting results!)

That's all for this simple analysis. Remember

Random Statistic To Entice You In: 18 people (28% of the 64 responses) don't know what philosophical naturalism is!

**Week #4 results**

*What do you read the fic for?*

This week there were 27 responses.

Responses in order of popularity:

    Rationality					22	81%
    Characters					22	81%
    Thought experiment			21	78%
    Finding out what's coming	21	78%
    Science						18	67%

    Lore						15	56%
    Guessing what's coming		14	52%
    Pop culture					 3	11%
    Other						 3	11%

The 3 'other' responses were:

    criticisms of canon
    More specifically Quirrell is a very interesting character.
    I enjoy contrasting the differences between Canon!Harry and HPMOR!Harry

And the number of answers ticked per person (besides 'other' ones):

    9: 1
	8: 3
	7: 5
	6: 7
	5: 3
	4: 5
	3: 3

(i.e. 1 person ticked all 9

There's potential for a rather more in-depth analysis of this data, but it only gives you an idea of what I was going for.

Anyway, for example, tells us 61% of the 18 people who ticked 'science' also ticked 'the writing' - slightly less than the population-wide 67%). I guess the interesting numbers are those that differ significantly from the population-wide percentages in the key. Like we can see that 52% of all respondents particularly enjoy guessing what's coming, but only 44% of those who enjoy the science content.

And if you think I'm thinking too much about all this... well maybe you're in the wrong subreddit! :P Anyway

**Week #5: Five basic questions.**

This week I've added five basic questions that should be fairly self-explanatory.

**How would you rate the fic overall

1. *Awful*
2. Very bad
3. Bad
4. Mediocre
5. Good
6. Very good
7. *Amazing*

**Were you familiar with Eliezer Yudkowsky before reading HPMOR?**

And are you now? By 'familiar' I just mean you know a bit about the things he does besides HPMOR.

**How did you find out about HPMOR?**

I haven't tried to list the possible answers for this one

**Do you prefer the earlier or later chapters?**

I think it's not unreasonable to suggest that Eliezer has evolved in how he's writing the fic

Preferring the earlier or later chapters doesn't mean you don't like the other!

**What's your favourite moment so far?**

Identify the chapter and specific moment.

2. Reply to top-level comments with your confidence that the prediction is accurate
3. If someone has already expressed a confidence-level/justification that corresponds to your own

Plenty of people mentioned reading individual chapters many more times

Apparently one person's read it nearly 30 times. Crikey! Now go read something else O.o

----

**Week #7: What else do you read?**

So I'm interested in the general reading habits of HPMOR readers. I've decided the best way to figure that out would be to ask about your last year's reading.

a) How many books have you read in the last year?

 - Don't count HPMOR
 - Don't count short stories (we're talking at least like 50 pages here)
 - If you've read 5 books but they were like *this big*

b) What genres were they?

c) On a scale of 1-4, if you like, how much of 'a reader' are you?)

1. Not important
2. Slightly important
3. Very important
4. Extremely important

Humans historically have had to eat food

Just think about food. What if it wasn't necessary anymore. Imagine giving it up. Would you miss it? Can you imagine if eating was suddenly just mechanical, we like trying new foods, we create different food combinations, food can have fond associations, memories, experiences, it can be a source of delight, mystery, and having *a whole new experience* that means this much to you. House work!

It actually seems to me *incredibly sensible* to create subsets of humans which enjoy, it's *brilliant*!

If one day we no longer needed to eat (pick your sci-fi reason), by the way, it would still be fun to make new foods and to try to prove to others how good at making food we are, etc. But wouldn't something with utility achieve all that, and *more*?",,False,t5_2t5xf,True

&gt;And Father had finished by saying that plays like this were always unrealistic

&gt;That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three

To me

Now whether EY indeed intended for HPMOR to be based on only a small number of changes from the original

The obvious first point is rational!Lily Potter casting some sort of beautification spell on her sister Petunia. This decision cascaded into Petunia marrying Micheal Verres rather than Vernon Dursley

This doesn't, or even during Riddle's school time. I find it rather unlikely that canon!Harry would not have heard of David Monroe throughout all seven books. Still, inventing a whole new character who ends up filling the same role of Hogwarts Defense Professor as canon!Quirrell just doesn't seem neat enough for EY. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I'm finding it rather difficult to pinpoint where this branch occurred.

Can you guys think of any more points where HPMOR breaks from canon

tl;dr:
Fiction should only assume like 2 or 3 things. Lily made Petunia pretty

Any ideas?

edit: There are obviously more small differences than I'd realized. I then stumbled upon this from the [author's notes](https://www.evernote.com/pub/adelenedawner/Eliezer#b=90390ce2-1356-4522-959e-a300957704c5&amp;st=p&amp;n=f3753a14-3e72-4543-ae0e-de5bb33b5055) to Chapter 33-34:

&gt;A word on the rules this fic follows. It is not a strict single point of departure. Changes from the original Harry Potter universe may occur for any of the following reasons:

&gt;1) Changes growing out of the fic's single point of departure - a single event that happened differently

&gt;2) Changes that smooth over the seams of the universe. When Rowling wrote the first book, if the curse really had been operating for decades, everyone would have noticed and would be expecting something to go wrong with Professor Quirrell.

&gt;3) Changes that result from taking a hypothesis more seriously. For example, wouldn't politicians invite him to ceremonies marking the 10th anniversary?

&gt;4) Changes to the laws of magic so that, because they are part of the background setting rather than the plot. This is not one of those stories.

&gt;5) Changes that result from this not being a children's book. Writing a children's book is much harder than writing a story for grownups. I can't do it. Therefore this is a story for grownups... and that means it is impossible that an evil Peter Pettigrew is hiding out as Scabbers, it would mean Pettigrew was holding the Idiot Ball. It is a general law of MoR that no one is ever holding the Idiot Ball.

&gt;6) Changes that result from a general philosophy of upgrading obstacles to match the more powerful protagonist. One illustration of this is that in Goblet of Fire, because this is not a children's story, and in a grownup story that plan would require Lord Voldemort to be holding the complete set of all seven Idiot Balls.

&gt;7) Changes that are required to make the fic artistically complete when seen against the background of Harry Potter fanfiction

Many of the small changes to magic and the universe can be encapsulated by 2-7. So it seems like the central changes to Harry and Voldemort can be traced back to one point of departure. My guess is,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1356874750.0,,,t3_15lly0

We know that fire and acid confuse a troll's regenerative powers [1], which occurred after Fred and George used fire on the troll. [2] [3] So clearly it was still able to regenerate in some capacity despite having been attacked with fire.

So with that in mind

1: Fire and acid stop the troll regenerating only wounds inflicted by fire or acid.

2: The Sword of Gryffindor stopped the troll regenerating the wound it inflicted. [4]

So, that seems unlikely...though it's also possible that Quirrell knew certain ancient artifacts could stop a troll's regeneration, but didn't bother to mention it because it was a useless piece of information, like sunlight; one typically doesn't have ancient magical artifacts in their possession when encountering mountain trolls.

###**Spoilers**
 
We begin this speculation with quotes from Chapter 84.

&gt;Bones - ""But your House - there are not many Ancient Houses remaining -""  
&gt;Quirrell - ""It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient Houses remain

We learn that there are 8 houses

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Potter
* The Lost House

To me, but holds gender *as well as* nobility preference over him. This would therefore be read as Astorga **not** being a Noble House

The ""Lord Jugson"" assertion is more murky due to two things. First, however, second, the Jugsons are referenced in another chapter as over 500 years old, and third he's the only person thus far addressed as ""Lord"" other than the elder Malfoy. I'd say with some certainty that the House Jugson is on our list.

The Black family is another questionable surname. They are without a doubt Most Ancient, it may also not preclude them from holding their place on our list of Noble Houses. Humor me and lets put them up there.

Our list stands at:

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Potter
* Jugson
* Black
* The Lost House
* Number 8?

There are also quite a few others being posited. The Nott family, and I'm sure there's more. Lets move on to chapter 86.

&gt;And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law Enforcement thought 'Quirinus Quirrell' really was. A seemingly ordinary Hogwarts student (though talented enough that he'd been only narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy position) who'd gone vacationing in Albania after his graduation, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -

&lt;Insert everything we know from chapter 84 here\&gt;

&gt;""It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie's name, once they realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves. And that's just what the bastards did - hope that some other bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to step in front. *It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom*. That was nearly everyone in the Ministry who'd dare say a word that might give Voldie offense.""

&gt;""That was how your House came to be ennobled, whoever avenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure, the House of Potter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours was titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in recognition that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of Monroe.""

With the previous two passages

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Potter
* Jugson
* Black
* Monroe
* Number 8?

But wait

&gt;And if the Defense Professor was David Monroe, which had been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.

Here, then there are only 7. If it is not, there are 8. According to McGonagall and Harry, if the Monroe line is dead, then the House Potter has avenged them, so there are now 8 with Potter replacing Monroe. If the Monroe line is NOT dead, then there are *still* 8 with Monroe instead of Potter as there would be no extinct line to avenge. From this

Our actual list of Noble Houses is therefore:

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Monroe OR Potter
* Jugson
* Black
* Number 7?
* Number 8?

Which means that there are still two spots left open. 

Now, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom..."" We know that two of those four are definitely on the list of Noble Houses. Based off of [this list of Pure Bloods](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pureblood#Known_pure-bloods) and the Crouch's political affiliations, it stands to reason that the Crouchs could be among the Noble Houses, however, in canon, they are not on the list of purebloods, the Noble houses do not reflect those of in canon

Since we have no foot to stand on from a MOR!canon historical perspective

&gt;It is kind of obvious, do you actually believe that under natural circumstances, anyone would end up as the last heir to a Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family AND he has to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I'd say he went too far over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal literary hero. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real life.

&gt;This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his heritage

Given this point

* Good
  * \*Longbottom
  * \*Greengrass
  * \* Monroe OR Potter
  * Crouch
  * Bones
* Bad
  * \*Malfoy
  * \*Jugson
  * \*Black
  * Lestrange
  * Nott
* Uncertain
  * One or Two Other or Yet Unknown Houses

The above is simply my analysis. Stars obviously designate those already on the list. Crouch is the only House I have reservations about but only because I don't recall them even being in HPMOR thus far other than in passing

It seems to me, while an unknown house would take the Bad spot. I say this because the Lestranges are essentially Blacks and the Notts are essentially Jugsons. There's no need for a double. On the other hand, the Crouchs aren't important enough to be good, while the Bones have been a pretty big part. This also then leaves the door open for a different House to step in. 

From a literary standpoint, but known to the characters, serve, or for that matter, what purpose would the Bones family being Noble serve? Remember, this is Britain, and Wizarding Britain at that: EVERYONE knows who the Nobles are... except us and perhaps Harry. I am positive that the next one or two Noble Houses will not remain unknown in the next story arc. I don't think, that those Houses will make an appearance as students. At least one will be 'bad' and have aligned with Voldemort during the war. One will probably also have a very high, thereby doubling our open spots. Feel free to discuss. 

Next:

##Who the hell is Quirinius Quirrell?""

There are quite a few options here

1. The real David Monroe never came back from Albania.  
2. The real David Monroe died when he didn't show up for the Wizengamot vote.
4. The real David Monroe died some time after the war
3. The real David Monroe is still alive.

Without a doubt Quirrell is putting on a show to make it seem like he **is** David. But is he actually David? Could he be another legitimate Noble from the extra house? Could he have faked being David Monroe some time after the real David had died?  Could he be pretending to be one of those two without having done so in the past? The following line from Quirrell

&gt;""And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling

So lets just say that Quirinius Quirrell is without a doubt a manufactured identity. Furthermore

Imagine the Interdict of Merlin algorithm goes like this: check for magic gene -&gt; if the gene exists, Interdict! Further, imagine that if one is Interdicted once, they will be Interdicted till death.

This might explain the origin of the tradition of sending kids to school at 11- that's when the Interdict of Merlin requires you to get a wand. People like Bacon may represent a crack in the system, anything Bacon wrote in his diary could in fact bypass the Interdict of Merlin, though Quirrell remarks that he never got far in his research.

To take this further, is not very likely, and is a really simplistic model of how the Interdict of Merlin treats media that belong to Witches/Wizards.

The flaw in this

Maybe kids under school-age aren't even Interdicted- the kind of wandless magic that kids can perform is fairly harmless and almost never controlled. As for the other extreme, kids who get expelled are possibly still under the Interdict.

**Week #3 results**

*'Less Wrong' philosophies*

This question received only 7 responses :(

    Philosophical naturalism: 
    Strongly for (5) 
    What's that? (2)

2 people didn't know what philosophical naturalism was

    Science: 
    Strongly for (7)

All 7 were strongly for science being a highly significant human pursuit. So far so good!

    Rationality: 
    Strongly for (7)

All 7 were strongly for rationality also being a highly significant human pursuit.

    Intelligence: 
    Leaning towards (3) 
    Strongly for (4)

Intelligence being the *most* significant human attribute did not inspire quite so much certainty

    Artificial Intelligence: 
    Strongly against (1) 
    Leaning towards (3) 
    Strongly for (3)

Similarly

    Friendly Artificial Intelligence: 
    Leaning against (1) 
    Leaning towards (2) 
    Strongly for (4)

It seems at least that everyone had *heard* of FAI (not what I expected, humans weren't designed carefully to have the right programming, so why would a slightly smarter intelligence almost definitely make us all into paperclips?). Does the dissenter from the previous question, who was strongly for this one, think that Friendliness is so important that the risk of getting it wrong are too much?

    The Technological Singularity:
    Leaning against (1)
    Leaning towards (3)
    Strongly for (3)

I'm interested in those who were strongly for this one: where do you get your certainty from?

    Transhumanism:
    Leaning towards (2)
    Strongly for (5)

2 people have reservations about transhumanism.

    Immortality:
    Leaning towards (1)
    Strongly for (6)

An interesting one this one - I imagine everyone has thought about immortality at one time or another. No 'deathism' expressed here!

    Cryonics:
    Leaning against (1)
    Leaning towards (4)
    Strongly for (2)

The first one with fewer strongly for than leaning towards. Interesting that supporters of immortality have reservations about this one!

    Poylamory:
    Leaning against (1) 
    Leaning towards (3) 
    Strongly for (2)

One person did not submit a response to this one

3 of the 7 respondents expressed reservations about at least one of the statements

* The setting/lore
* The characters
* Trying to guess what's going to happen

**My ideas**

The basics:

* Demographics stuff?? I'm a bit concerned about questions like these, that I can think of: age, gender identity, country, present employment/education status, educational level/fields, religious views, they're getting weirder though. Sexuality? Marital status? How do you sum up a person? Maybe we should just stick to age
* What chapter was the fic at when you first read it/how long have you been reading the fic?
* Were you familiar with Eliezer Yudkowsky before reading HPMOR?
* How did you find out about HPMOR?
* Does anyone else you know read HPMOR?
* How do you rate HPMOR? (7-point scale - awful/very bad/bad/not *good*

And some more fun questions:

* What's your favourite moment so far? (either a text response or a chapter number - or both!)
* Where do you fall on the 'desperation for updates' scale?
 1. Extreme unconcern (Honestly couldn't care less when the next chapter comes out)
 * Strong unconcern (Completely comfortable with waiting
 * Slight unconcern (I've got plenty to be getting on with between updates
 * Balanced (I can wait
 * Slight concern (I do get antsy waiting for updates)
 * Strong concern (It's a serious problem with this fic)
 * Extreme concern (I can't bear to read this fic with such long delays)
* Which MOR!House would you want to be in?
 * Ravenclaw (intelligence above all else?)
 * Slytherin (figuring out *how can I achieve X*?)
 * Hufflepuff (honesty
 * Gryffindor (fighting evil?)
* Which of these keep you personally invested in the fic:
 * Science (learning new science/more about science)
 * Methods of Rationality (learning ways to be rational)
 * Philosophy (exploring questions of good/evil
 * Psychology (exploring characters' motivations
 * Hunting for clues about the plot
 * Spotting pop culture references
 * Anything major I've missed that characterises readers' investment in the fic?

We have also been told that Harry's edge over Voldemort is via magic 'he knows not'. As I count it

Additionally, oh, a space probe in the outer edged of the solar system), it would be able to successfully destroy an apparently inaccessible horcrux. An additional targeting trick if it only affected a desired target to investigate is using the Suns gravity to slingshot the effect back at the Earth to let its targeting find any other Horcruxes without having to search them down one at a time.

&gt; If you throw a Transfigured object and de-Transfigure it, one of which is that, even in MoR, Special Relativity is simply the way reality is; you can add laws that violate conservation of momentum and even conservation of energy (though the latter requires the insanity of single-world QM, but then so does the Time-Turner), but in a Minkowskian universe the idea of a privileged frame of reference is too incoherent even for magic. The other reason is that if you didn't know about conservation of momentum or energy, of course you'd expect the object to continue with the same velocity.

The conservation of velocity requires violation of both momentum and energy conservation

Now

    [; E_i = \sqrt{ (p_ic)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 } ;]

and after

    [; E_f = \sqrt{ (p_fc)^2 + 4(m_0c^2)^2 } ;]

If we hold that p_i=p_f

    [; E_f = \sqrt{ 3(m_ic^2)^2 + E_i^2 } ;]

Alternatively we could conserve energy at the expense of momentum (ignoring, which is technically 1m_0c^2 of energy already).

    [; p_f = \sqrt{ p_i^2 - 3(m_ic)^2 } ;]

1375818851.0,1jtzy9,Time Turners in a branching universe,alexanderwales,9,3,6,"So I was just reading the [Causal Universes](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/#more) article on Less Wrong. This seems to be more or less how time travel works in HPMOR; the universe does a kind of brute force search on on the future

However

Consider this paragraph:

&gt; If a time machine does allow for changing history, say, you'd save a copy of the universe's state to disk. When the Time-Changer was activated at 9pm, you'd retrieve the saved state of the universe from one hour ago at 8pm, load it into RAM, and then insert the Time-Changer and its user in the appropriate place. This would, of course, which is the same as ending that world and killing everyone in it.

Now, and the ""new"" universe created by time travel is just run in parallel as a separate thread with its own share of RAM (that's why you can never have enough RAM). We now have universe A and universe B, and they both survive just fine without either being destroyed.

It's probably clear where I'm going with this.

If you can have multiple universes splitting off from each other, then go into the next room and travel backwards in time five minutes and exit through another door. In the origin universe, which we'll call Universe A, there was no one in the next room while I was sitting around waiting.

However, there was a copy of myself from Universe A quietly making his exit. I've already precommitted to going into the next room and traveling back in time, so I do that, ending up in Universe C. And so on, until the universe simulator is running an infinite number of universes that are all identical. From my perspective, it doesn't matter whether I'm in Universe B or higher, since they're all the same to me. And if I set up cameras

So a high-level metatime view of the multiverse of time-travel created universes would probably see a lot of dead ends, but eventually they would either result in terminating universes, or in an infinite chain of identical (or possibly oscillating) universes. And since there are so many more of the universes where things appear to be the same, you would expect to find yourself in them more often than not.

So take the prank Harry plays on himself with the pies when he first is about to acquire the Time-Turner. In the multiple universe method, where the prank appears as *fait accompli* - because the prank has reached a completely self-replicated equilibrium.

Just wish EY had gone a little non-canon and bumped up the ages to 14-15 or so. Would make things a lot more believable.

Start of Chapter 3... Harry Potter walks into a bar. Just seems like a strange place to suddenly be if he's on a shopping trip. And the early Quirrell reference is just way too obvious

Chapter 6... halfway through an unexpected diversion into child abuse. Just seems to stick out like a sore thumb. Also Harry barely knows Minerva and he's already challenging her pretty hard

A random thought popped into my mind when I heard someone mention the sorting hat, I can't find any.

So

""Oh

When I read it for the first time, we can assume Riddle who later turns into Voldemort was under that hat too. So adding the current theory that Voldemort is one of the personalities Quirrel has been playing, wouldn't it be probable that he asked himself the same question? And if not him, the myriads of students sorted before, this kind of thing would highly likely pop up into a mind of lets say a muggle born kid seeing a talking hat for the first time. (Or a random thought of anyone else I guess.) 

So taking this into consideration

""I can tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind, personality, or feelings - in your scar. Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being under my brim.""

What if he was wrong and the dark persona was actually participating in the conversation

Now for how to make this theory work (and make some wild guesses and assumptions).

Firstly, of the Horcrux (or some kind of essence of cynicism and darkness, since the Horcrux Harry isn't really confirmed in HPMOR yet), and a spell that works like an emulator, basically loading Harry's mind into it and running it with the Horcrux filter.
If this emulator somehow got mixed up with the magic of sorting hat

Another way to explain it being undetected

1337290706.0,tsaca,Magic and Genetics in HPMOR,Petruchio_,6,1,7,"For full disclosure

I am unable to understand the role of genetics and magic in HPMOR. Harry’s theory of magic and genetics states there is a magical allele, have two copies of the magical allele, MM. This determines if a person has magic or not, whether they were born or muggles or wizards. Squibs have one magical allele, and one muggle allele, Mm. Muggles do not have any magical alleles, and are mm.

Harry and Draco observed that Squib couples had a ratio of 25% magical kids, discovered first by Gregor Mendel’s experiments with pea plants.

HOWEVER, ignorant of the magical world, just so happening to copulate and giving birth to a magical child.

The second expected observation would be no Squibs being born of pureblood families. The original books, though of course this may just not be true of HPMOR-verse

But lastly, and thus Squibs. There would be no such thing as half-blood wizards at all, wizards would be pure-blood, born of squibs, or some combination of the two. 

Is my science and reasoning correct?

1337011927.0,tmm3i,Possible implications of Harry's lineage. Contains spoilers.,TryNeutral,6,2,10,"Canon!Harry, but my speculation is this:

Salazar Slytherin, he either hid the affair or did not know he had fathered a child. As a result, the line of Slytherin continued separately from his actual House, and separately from the rest of the wizarding world. This line terminates in Harry, coming through Lily.

Evidence to support this hypothesis: Harry and Draco's discovery that magic is passed down through an on/off gene means that wizards born into non-magical families

Additionally, fake Heirs of Slytherin would surely have popped up and tried to use it as a means of proving their legitimacy. Draco's immediate assumption that Harry is the Heir implies that this is not the case- he was not even remotely suspicious that Harry had somehow acquired Parselmouth by some other means.

If this speculation is true, which would account for his complete removal from the wizarding world while still having magical ability; he could even be one of Harry's ancestors.

Secondly, that it would help garner support for Harry-as-WizardKing from many of the anti-Dumbledore faction, and secondarily that it could be used as an ace-in-the-whole against blood purists to find out Salazar had a bastard with a muggle. One could even go out on a limb and speculate that Bacon's diary itself contains a clue as to his ancestry, and Quirrelmort chose Harry from birth for that reason.
