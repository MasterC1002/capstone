1375332348.0,1jh2wg,DIY LED Lights &amp; Test Results! [X-post from r/hydro],byronnn,26,0,1,"So I've been working on a system for growing kale indoors and as part of that I've put together and bought some LED lights.  
SuperAngryGuy was a big help through PM and [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/1gfyvs/are_these_led_lights_any_good/).  
  
I started off looking on eBay for cheap LED grow lights and ended up buying [this 18W light](http://www.ebay.com/itm/TOPGROW-6X3W-Series-LED-Grow-Light-Lamp-for-flower-plant-herbs-vegetables-/111094734982?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEWNX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=bKz8%252BpGf1R4XbeKLRa2igeD82vE%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc) and [this 27W light](http://www.ebay.com/itm/BestGrow-6RED-3BLUE-9X3W-High-Power-LED-Grow-Light-Lamp-For-Flowering-Plants-/111096658016?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEWNX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=bKz8%252BpGf1R4XbeKLRa2igeD82vE%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc). The problem with these is that they do not actually consume the amount of power listed. I contacted the seller for the emitter information and by my best guess they use about 35% of the listed power
  
The lights I ended up building are made from cheap eBay [emitters](http://www.ebay.com/itm/380471971154?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) and [drivers](http://www.ebay.com/itm/111083822403?var=410179871603&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) attached with [thermal adhesive](http://www.ncix.com/products/?sku=23642&amp;promoid=1062) so a CPU cooler. I used CPU coolers that were on sale ($12/each) and powered the fan with a [DC adapter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/200798800333?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649). I used a 40W driver on a 50W emitter and a 50W driver on a 60W to increase the working life of the emitters. [Album is here.](http://imgur.com/a/G3Hc2)
  
This summer I'm working at an agricultural research station and have access to a PAR light meter so I tested my lights. I pointed the lights directly at the sensor from 18 and 9 inches. [Here are the results.](http://i.imgur.com/OFemJEZ.png) I was told that this sensor is not particularly accurate below 500 which might explain some of the unexpected results.
  
The eBay lights look to be more efficient than the lights I built which is likely due to them being so significantly under driven. The 40W light did better than the 50W light which may be due to bad luck with cheap LEDs or me reading the meter inaccurately.  
  
As per [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17ny46/plant_lighting_intensity/) I'm aiming for 500+ uMol/meter^2 /sec on 4 square feet so these lights should do well if kept less than 9 inches above the canopy.

1363376104.0,1ad8qb,Advice on growing beans/seeds indoors for Elementary Education grad student science project? (cross-post from /r/gardening),small-medium-atlarge,9,2,4,"I'm taking a grad class on science education and, a woman working there recommended green beans as a quick-growing plant. I also decided to go back and get a ""back-up plant"" in case something goes wrong with the beans. The guy who I spoke to when I went there the second time recommended corn as a back-up.

To be clear, so I thought I'd try to get a consensus here.

Basic info:

* My main plant is ""Earliserve Bush Bean"" with maturity at 45 days and my back-up plant (in case something goes wrong with beans) is ""Early Sunglow Corn"" with maturity at 65 days.

* The variable for this experiment is soil type. I will plant 4 beans in containers with potting soil and 4 beans in containers with regular dirt I dug up from the yard. (Repeating this also for the back-up plant

* I live in the Hudson Valley in NY and unfortunately it's not been incredibly sunny lately. Still pretty cold too-- mostly highs in 40's and lows in the 30's. The weather this past week was mostly cloudy

That said

1) Do I sprout the beans in a damp paper towel in a ziplock bag? Corn too? Or soak them? For how long before planting? I have no idea and have read conflicting things about this

2) Do I find a supplementary heat source for growing indoors? Use some sort of enclosed planter to create a ""greenhouse"" environment?

3) I have to measure and record everything-- including amount of water and how frequently. One person recommended misting with a spray bottle to not disturb the seeds early on. Another person said simple watering from a measuring cup is fine. Again

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated-- I am working in a group with 2 other grad students (one is doing the Powerpoint and the other is researching plant growth) and I am nervous about messing this up since I am responsible for the actual plants. Help! :-)

I harvested right before Christmas break since I don't have any kind of automated watering system ([Arduino anyone?](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/arduino-powered-plant-can-water-itself/)).

Probably not good

I know the pot size I need but I can't figure out what brands to buy for soil and I thought the directions I was given would be helpful to me.

They aren't.

So in the pamphlet I got, or perlite.
I was thinking Miracle Gro but those all have wetting agents or fertilizer as far as I can tell. Espoma Organic potting mix also seems like it might not work.

I'm confused, daily, and water the trees in their current state when the shavings it's sitting in are dry. /ihavenoideawhatimdoing

my mother bought some plants from home depot.

Fast forward a week ago =&gt;
--
I spot spider webs with tiny brown dots about the size of a grain of salt. All over one of the new plants and a doll near by it.

Take it outside for a good wash - left out there 

and vacuum that whole area then put the doll in a plastic.


Next Day =&gt; 
--
My Mother brought back both items back into the house...

The doll had massive amount of black specs crawling over it.


Repeated what I did before. 

Day After That =&gt;
--

Mother puts plant back in same place.  -Oh

Now a week later ...
--
Black specs on certain items in the house

While others are more developed red crab like tiny specks. 

With hints of webbing on the plant and surrounding objects.


So
--
If I keep the infected plant out of the house.

* Then Vacuum everything will this stop this nightmare ?
* 
Also any idea what to do with the items that have the mites?
