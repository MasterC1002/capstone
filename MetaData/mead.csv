I bought all seven (for roughly the price of one such jug at my LHBS), they go through several gallons a day. But they said that's nothing compared to their sister orchard, [Carter Mountain](http://www.cartermountainorchard.com/), in Charlottesville, which also sells the empties for $1 each.

If you want some one-gallon jugs and live nearby, and see if they'll set them aside for you. If you don't live nearby, check your own orchards as they open this year.

Recipe as follows:

* 24lbs raw virginia honey

* 2 gallons of black currant juice

* 96 oz can of elderberry juice

Bring up to 160F and pasteurize for about 45 min. 

Cool kettle in the tub and add: 

* 6 green Anjou/bartlett pears
* 6 cinnamon sticks
* 6 palmfuls of black pepper corns
* 6 handfuls of raisins. 
* 9 whole cloves

Stir like hell and pitch the following:

* Monster double EC1118 starter with grape juice along with a third packet of 1118 dry at about 82 F

* Stir like hell again

Results:

The airlock started working a mere 4 hours later. After 12 hours it was going batshit crazy. Over the last 24 hours or so I have had to refill the airlock twice.

This guy is started to get nice and golden. Next time I will definitely make this in a nylon straining bag. I'd like to rack this soon and strain the bottom crud out. This is my first batch and I combined a few recipes so I was kind of all over the place while getting it right. I've tasted it and it is definitely potent

Oct 8: 

Roasted 4 pumpkin pie pumpkins, with 1/4 tsp PPS each. 
Didn't think I'd have enough pumpkin so I used 2 sweet potatoes as well
Roasting Procedure: 425-350-400 deg F for about 2 hours

Oct 10:

Roasted 5th pumpkin with 1/4 PPS and ~1-2 TBSP of brown sugar. 
Roasting Procedure: 300 for 30 mins, maybe 20-30 mins. They were pretty soft at this point but still kind of raw.
Warmed lots of water to 120 deg F
Changed to high heat to bring to boil
Pulled apart  pumpkin and added to water, chopped up, might add a second half in secondary fermentation
Boiled for 10-15 mins stirring occasionally. 
Added 4 twists of orange peel
Left the mixture over night to cool then transferred to plastic bucket and added water to about 23 L

Oct 11:

Pitched a package of Lavilin EC1118 yeast and added it to the mead

Oct 23 (ish):

 I forgot to mark down the exact date

It was a joy to read. 

I also learned tons on r/mead and am still learning everyday. We are both new to homebrewing and I think mazing is a most excellent way to introduce oneself to it.

So in October 2012, and the second one a JAOM. Both turned out good, but we both prefer the JAOM. I think with more ageing the traditional mead could really turn out though. 

Here's the album: http://imgur.com/a/dAvSb

I added some notes for every picture

When we prepared the must, we did not use any clarifying agents - gravity did all the work for us.


Recipes we used:

**Traditional Mead**

	• 3 lbs white honey (1.4 kg)
	• spring water to fill carboy
	• 1 tsp yeast nutrient
	• 1 tsp yeast energizer
	• 1 packet EC-1118 Lavlin yeast

**Slightly Modified JAOM**

	• 3.5 lbs white honey (1.6 kg)
	• 1 large orange (used zest and juice only)
	• 1 small handful of raisins (25)
	• 1 stick of cinnamon
	• 1 whole clove
	• pinch of nutmeg and allspice
	• 1 packet of EC-1118 bread yeast
	• spring water to fill carboy
	• 1/4 tsp nutrient &amp; 1/2 tsp energizer

For our next project, and make a cyser and maybe a pineapple melomel. In the meantime, we're always looking to find additional bulk honey suppliers in the region. We're based around Ottawa, Ontario and it's been quite the challenge so far, but loved every minute of it.

It is time to brew our second like-minded mead following the basic guidelines of the first one

1. You will brew a cyser. Your choice of recipe, technique, flavor, ingredients, yeast, size, etc.
2. The only REAL rule is it has to be a cyser of some sorts and it has to be brewed during the month of May (part of these exchanges is it provides exchangeable info and comparable results
3. Share your notes
4. Sign-up for the actual exchange will take place during February 2013
5. The actual exchange will take place on March 2013.

There's still plenty of time to do the actual exchange, your job is just to make the best gosh darn cyser you can come up with. Good luck everyone. And may the ~~force~~ drunk be with you!

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/ojk6t/hey_rmead_help_lets_create_an_original_recipe/)

.............

Unofficial dates (Please reply with any objections to these dates):

-Best made by date is: 02/24/2012 - 03/17/2012 (you have 3 weeks)

-Target for exchanging/shipping bottles is: 12/15/2012

..............

Rules:

1. We will all come to a consensus on the recipe and we will all make the exact same recipe. Everything else is left to skill.
2. We should try and brew roughly during the same timeframe (mentioned above) to keep fermentation times equal.
3. You may sidetrack a bit from the recipe and/or process (quantities, etc), but you cannot use additional or different flavoring ingredients.
4. The recipe will be called ""Bacon Mead"" (in honor of redditors' obsessive addiction to bacon) or ""r/mead Mead"" (please vote on your favorite) in case you wish to create a custom label for it unless you wish for us to create one for everyone).
5. Matching will start in November
6. If you are against any rules or recipe ingredients
7. Be sure to post your process so we can compare techniques; and once the bottling and exchange is done we can compare results.

................

""Bacon Mead"" Recipe ([/r/mead](/r/mead) Mead as voted for on the original thread. The recipe is incomplete

Honey: Clover Honey (for accessibility and budget reasons) 3lb per Gallon ratio

Yeast: [D47](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/winemaking-ingredients/yeast/dry/lalvin-wine-yeasts-5-grams-1cv-d-47-white-wine.html). (posted link for those who cannot find it locally

Yeast Nutrient/Energizer as needed.

Flavor: Juniper (Juniper Berries were chosen as the primary ingredient for the recipe)

................

Still to be voted for:

Since Juniper isn't exactly a ""Main Flavor"" we still need other spices/flavor to add to the mix.

Majority vote for the moment is Pumpkin. No-one has any idea if this works with Juniper

These spices were suggested on the original thread as things that go along well with juniper (thanks to Kurai_):

orange or lemon peel, cubeb, licorice, saffron, coriander, nutmeg or grains of paradise. People were pretty specific on raisins, and I quote

Final rules

................

TL;DR: Sorry bro/sis

................

EDIT/UPDATE 1: Hello fellow mazers (slang for mead brewers and [/r/mead](/r/mead) word of the day) I was out all day and couldn't do an update. but here we go.

To clarify, we completely understand if you send out a 12oz one (but please try to make the 750ml one happen). Everyone will have a match, so everyone should receive one as well.

The name of the recipe (in case you wish to make your own custom label) will be ""r/mead Mead.""

There already seems to be a recipe winning today

For those that forecast dificulty finding juniper berries

..............

EDIT/UPDATE 2: I don't see any objections on date

Pumpkin is out. Mr. Pumpkin

.............

EDIT/UPDATE 3: Blackout is about to hit

""[/r/mead](/r/mead) MEAD"" was the voted on name

There seem to be a lot of great suggestions. Tomorrow I will run through everything again and I will post the winning recipe. Lemon or orange peels or zest seem to be taking the lead by a lot.

...........

EDIT/UPDATE 4: Preliminary Final Recipe (from what I've gathered from comments and votes):

-Clover Honey - 3lb per gallon

-D47

-Juniper Berries (dried for accessibility; fresh ok too I guess)

-Orange peel

-Dates

Yay or nay? Seems a bit basic

............

LAST UPDATE/EDIT BEFORE POSTING RULES AND RECIPES:

I was thinking. How about we just keep the rules like this. The only things that are ""obligated"" is the clover honey 3lb per gallon, I will pick the most upvoted ingredients and it will be posted in the rules/recipe. ;) VOTE!

............

GOSH! Another UPDATE:

Voting is closed. All has been decided. Prepare for some awesome mead making my friends. Official rules and other stuff you probably won't read to be announced and posted on the sidebar later today!

So, but after looking into it further, I wish I had). While I realize the yeast need these compounds, it just didn't feel right dumping these weird smelling powders into my sweet must. I don't really think that organic/ ""natural"" foods/ additives are inherently better than those that are conventionally grown/ made; my aversion to the compounds in this form is purely visceral. Water, honey and yeast seem to be such pure ingredients, it felt like I was tainting the must.

That being said, lemon juice, dead yeast, and even grape nuts cereal contain the necessary compounds (another separate but related question: if I were to use dead yeast, could I take a leftover yeast cake from another brew, freeze it , then thaw it out when needed

Racking is not going to help your mead clear. Mead's clear because the particulate matter settles out due to the force of gravity. Heavier (larger) particles in general settling faster than lighter (smaller) particles. Racking can make your mead less clear because 1) you keep stirring up the particles in the mead each time and 2) no matter how gently you rack,  and ending up with smaller and lighter particles that now take even longer to settle out. 

The only way to speed up the settling process is to use some type of fining agent that modifies the surface chemistry of the particles, please do so!

I'm curious

I'm a noob.  Started 6 weeks ago.

What I'm working on right now:
- 5 gallon clover mead (racking to 2nd this sunday)
- (2) 1 gallon batches of a cider with 1 lb honey per gallon
- 1/2 gallon of a pomegranate wine. (started it last night and got an OG of 1.135)
- Bottled an English Brown Ale and should be ready to drink on saturday

What I'm planning:
-5 gallons of JOAM and will probably use clementines
-1 gallon Cyzer (I'll probably use 3lbs of honey and D47)
-1 gallon Perry (maybe)

Then, ideas

*

TL;DR: My grandmother makes the best lemon cookies.

*

this is a self post

*

EDIT: We can start with the basics.

What honey should we use?

Spiced/flavored/citric/original mead?

*

EDIT 2: Quick summary

What about additional ingredients? fruits? nuts? spices? non? keep at it.

EDIT 2.1: Also, since it will age the same for everyone.)

*

EDIT 3: can everyone get Orange Blossom Honey? If not

*

EDIT 4: Ok so

Nut flavored mead. Which nuts?

Sweet mead yeast. Possibly wyeast 4184? EDIT 4.1: What about D47?

3lb per gallon ratio.

To be brewed in the next two months more or less. Fall or Christmas bottle exchange?

*

*

EDIT 5: Ok

Honey: Clover Honey. 3lb per gallon ratio.

Yeast: D47

Flavor/Type: A nutty mead. Also

Only 2 people mentioned spiced

Bottle exchange will be more or less during end of year

*

EDIT 6: Votes are in. We are only waiting on what nut might go well with Juniper Berries and we are set! Common guys. DO EET!

EDIT 6.1: just talked to mods and they are in. When the recipe is competed and we have a date set

*

EDIT (infinity): A very smart and considerate mazer (Kurai_) made a great point on nuts and allergies, so I will make a more official one next with all the updated info.

Anyway, in place of the water. When I first bottled it, it was super sweet.  I had 3 full 500 ml bottles, and one partial. I put them in the top of a dark closet and didn't mess with them. Now it is November, and I tried about 30 ml of the partial bottle and WOW.  The sweetness has toned down, you can clearly taste the apples and a hint of the raisins.  It turned out to be a really good brew, especially for my first one.

Quinte Essence (Belgian mead) - 1 gallon batch

* Roughly 2.8 pounds wildflower honey
* Roughly 6 oz. crushed light candi sugar
* Zest of one orange
* 1/2 tsp cracked coriander seed
* 1/2 vial WLP-500 yeast
* Water
* Yeast nutrient/energizer (SNAs)

After as much research as I could do on belgian ale yeast in mead (there isn't much out there) I tried this out and hoped for the best.  O.G. was about 1.111 and F.G. just topped out at 1.020 putting it around 11% abv.  This thing was drinkable AND smelled great all throughout fermentation.  Even at 1.040 it was delicious.  Don't expect all the crazy phenols you would get with a belgian ale

Now for my problem child...or should I say children.

A little while back I brewed an amazing red pyment with red grape concentrate and wildflower honey, and was dumping a lot of it out so as to water it down.  In hindsight I figured I could do a scaled down batch at a later date, stretching the fermentables I used for a 1 gallon batch into a 2 gallon batch, creating something of a lighter bodied/less alcoholic version I am calling Young Winyards.  I did this on 07/29/12, and fermentation hauled ass (11.7% in 4 days!).  The Old Winyards was extremely quick too - 16.2% in 8 days, and it was drinkable right off the bat and has only gotten better.  The Young Winyards however, reeks like rotten eggs.  It's really bad.  It's all you can smell when you sample it.  I tried racking and splashing to no avail.  Does anyone have any ideas for masking the H2S odor?  Is it possible it can age out?  I know most off-flavors do but I've heard H2S doesn't usually, and/or possibly some other spices.  Would back-sweetening with honey/water help?  (right now it's 100% dry).  At this point I don't care if I turn it into a completely different drink - I just want something that doesn't smell like pure rotten egg.  Help!",t5_2rcsz,True

I was on step five and about to rack into secondary with more honey and blueberries. I pulled off the airlock and it smelled great. Like a real wine. I was surprised but expected it to taste like death anyways. After racking I tasted the bit still in the racking cane and it was amazing. I am not really sure why.

The first three gallons of mead I used the [stormthecastle.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ueyNQfnfE) recipe that used a few oranges and raisins for nutrients. I added just a few raisins to the melomel and the boiled lees from a gallon of mead I had just racked (I didn't do this to the first three.) I also ended up adding a little bit more blueberries on accident to the primary so I used les in the secondary and a little under a pound of honey in the secondary. Other than that I followed the recipe.

Now its dawning in me.... KEY LIME PIE MEAD! So i juiced all the key limes and froze the juice when i got home.

SO I finally started a mead this weekend, I made a 500ml starter with some honey and table sugar, didn't let it ferment long but it seemed vigorous. No heat involved (I never do with mead)

I would describe the atmosphere for Mead Day as that of a mini-Renn Faire. Groups were doing sword fighting demonstrations and singing folk songs, chainmail, and turkey legs for sale outside.

The highlight for me was the tasting and the tour of the meadery. The owners and their friends/employees were on hand and well informed. Here are my thoughts:

**Tasting**: Starrlight offers a [wide variety of meads](http://starrlightmead.com/our-meads). I was able to taste eight or so meads they produced on site. Overall

Sticking your nose in a glass of the Spiced Apple Mead was the same as coming home to Mom's apple pie. The aroma offered strong notes of cinnamon and apple. The taste was much the same and offered a lot of sweet apple enjoyment. This mead would be at its best served warm on a cold winter day or room temp with a savory meat. Not surprisingly

The two mainstream meads were the Traditional Off-Dry and the Traditional Semi-Sweet. Both were quite palatable and would best be served chilled. Interestingly enough

I didn't care for the Off-Dry Pear Mead

**The Tour**: Starrlight has two 1, and four 1,100 secondary fermentation tanks. Fermentation, racking, bottling, and labeling all take place in the [production room](http://starrlightmead.com/content/production-area-progress), which was about the size of a two-car garage. Another room served as storage

The production room was truly interesting. Anyone with a single carboy at home would recognize the purpose of everything in the production room as similar to their home equipment

For filling bottles, they use PVC capsules that are heat-shrunk to fit the bottle in two seconds ([examples](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/winemaking-equipment/wine-bottling/pvc-capsules-decorative-finishes.html)).

The one place where Starrlight invested money in automation was the labeling. They purchase labels on rolls of 1, corking, and labeling 100 cases takes 2 hours with 2-3 people working.

Interestingly enough, and filtered water. At the first break, the mazer adds Fermaid-K, and at the second break, he adds DAP to help the yeast finish. The starting must has a sugar content of 23.5%, which yields an end result of 12.5% abv. This number is important because the mazer must pay additional excise taxes on wines above 14% abv.

With fermentation done and a product at 12.5% abv, the mazer adds more honey to backsweeten. Starrlight adds fruit juices to the Off-Dry Tradititional in secondary to create most of its other flavors. I believe they use actual fruit for smaller fun batches or seasonal batches.

The one real surprise was on sanitation. Starrlight uses citric acid and water to clean its tanks. I had never heard of this method

Overall I was very impressed by the production operation. They clearly know mead. I'm looking forward to trying the Lavendar and hope to make another trip there in the future.

So I racked my carboy full of mead

After all this

BUT NOW something is amiss: fermentation has restarted!  Starting exactly three days ago the airlock has been bubbling again, but the yeasties are most certainly working away.

First I'd like to talk yeast. I've been using Lalvin D-47 as it was recommended to me for melomels (I'm experimenting around quite a bit to get a nice blackberry mead recipe to make regularly), I'm not a huge fan of particularly dry ones.

Second

Also I'm curious what various recipes people think would be good to put oak in. I was thinking about trying to do it in a bochet (I started one of those a couple weeks ago and the must tasted/smelled amazing)

And of course

[My fermentation area](http://i.imgur.com/NOEom.jpg).

- 4 (center two small containers) is a blackberry melomel that is just finishing clarifying after I racked it off the fruit last week

- 5 (behind 9 at the left) is a high ABV acerglyn (maple mead)

- M6 (back row right) is a black cherry melomel (using juice instead of full fruit

- M7 (front right) is an apple cinnamon cyser (using the skyrim recipe listed in the /r/mead recipes!)

- 8 (front center) is a vanilla metheglin

- 9 is a bochet (nothing fancy about this one

Makes a tad bit more than 1 gallon. You will need:
Coffee (preferably whole beans
3 to 3.5 lb's of honey
1 gl of water
One of those steeping socks thinguies
airlock

FYI I suck at actual measurements because I don't have any proper equipment.

Step 0: SANITIZE! But that goes without saying.

Step 1: Steep about half a can or a bit more of coffee over night on the gallon of water. Do not boil anything. Just let it steep at room temperature. If you're going whole bean

Step 2: Bring the coffee water thingui to a boil (without the actual coffee) and boil for about 5 minutes. This is for sanitation purposes.

Step 3: Remove kettle (pot) from heat and let it cool off a bit. Preferably to a room temp.

Step 4: Add and dissolve honey. Make sure you get you get your yeast started going more or less now.

Step 5: Cool down the must to about 70-80F (if it's still warmer than that) and pitch the yeast.

Step 6: Pour into container of choice, and shake the living hell out of it to airate it.

Step 7: Ferment. Then, specially if it's pre-ground. Whole beans are the preferred way to go in this step).

Step 8: Rack again in about 2-3 weeks so the mead doesn't get too much of the coffee bitterness.

Step etcetera: Now you just re-rack how much you feel like it until it clears out and is ready for bottling.

My first batch was a starter kit that I got for Christmas that included honey

Boy, had tons of sediment in it, and tasted a little yeasty.  In hindsight, this should have been more than enough warning for me.

I had learned enough to know that first opening the last bottle filled was the best way to avoid bottle rockets and get a nicely settled and still mead.  That's what I did the day I bottled it.  I left the other three bottles resting on my kitchen table.

About a week after bottling

My next batch was a blueberry mead.  It was still fermenting in a plastic water jug, I racked the mead into the secondary.  In the secondary, I let it settle one week at room temperature, and a second week in the fridge.

Not having a hydrometer (or even knowing what it was at the time), that yeast doesn't do well at near freezing temps in the fridge.

I bottled the mead at a month into the process.  I've been keeping the bottles on their sides in the fridge.  Flavor is very good (though a bit on the sweet side for me).  Alcohol content is okay

I was more patient

My current batch, 1 gallon glass carboy, and a few tools such as a siphon, airlock, and cleaning equipment).  At the moment, it's been in the primary for about a week.  Tomorrow, it will get briefly opened to sample the batch (my girlfriend is coming by tomorrow, as well as how much longer I need to keep it in the fermenter (estimated

I figure I'll be racking it in the next week to week and a half.  After that

I didn't really follow any recipe, and it worked for the cider pretty well). I mixed 7kg of honey with about five gallons of water and five teaspoons of yeast nutrient (as per package directions). I heated the mixture up to about 40 degrees Celsius, which was the temperature the yeast said to use to reactivate it (I reactivated it in a separate mixture of just water, but I figured that starting the whole thing off at that temperature would give the yeast a good start—perhaps this is horribly wrong).

I did this saturday afternoon, so I know it didn't die right away (if it has indeed died). I'm worried because by this time on the cider, it was bubbling away nicely and there was *a lot* of yeast floating on the top.

As for the mead itself, which leaves me with an alcohol by volume of 8.9%. I'm slightly disappointed with these alcohol numbers - I should have used more honey in the starting batch so that the yeasties could have more feasties and convert more sugar to alcohol. It's all good though. Next time I'll use more honey at the beginning and end up with a stronger wine.

The mead is a very light champagne color - looks like a white wine as I'd expect... To this untrained palate, so the comparison may be very off - but at least it gives anyone who's not a mead person an idea of what it tastes like.

* when vigorous fermentation subsides

I let it go until fermentation slowed (a little over a month), blueberry, and pomegranate.  I also had enough left over for a gallon of orange blossom sack mead and a gallon of maple mead.  

Of the juices, and I bottled it.  It was already drinkable upon bottling, but had a strong alcohol burn to it.

The other juices required additional nutrients for the fermentation to really kick in.  The pomegranate finished next

The cranberry and blueberry are still fermenting slowly, however, has a distinctly uninteresting flavor.  I'd say for a blueberry mead using juice, some additional components will be necessary for a good end result.  I may try a citrus addition of some sort.  

Based on the results of the black cherry fermentation, though will definitely benefit from aging.

Here's the gear I have so far:

* 2 5-gallon carboys
* 2 3-gallon carboys
* 1 6.5-gallon primary fermenter
* Appropriate bungs and 3-piece air locks
* Racking cane + tubing
* Long handled and angled brush + sanitization stuff

I know I need the following:

* Stainless steel stock pot to warm the must
* Auto-siphon (recommendations? I don't need anything fancy)
* Long handed stainless steel spoon
* Some sort of corking device (not sure what kind I want + I'm a ways off from needing it)
* Wine thief
* Hygrometer + graduated cylinder

Have I forgotten any of the hardware?

I currently have ~25lbs of wildflower honey (got it locally for less than $2 a pound!) and am planning on making a 5-gallon batch (traditional semisweet) and a 3-gallon batch (metheglin).

For my traditional mead

* Day 1 - Put together the must. Only add 1/4 of the honey and nutrients. Pitch yeast.
* Day 2 - Wait
* Day 3 - Add 1/4 of the honey
* Day 4 - Add 1/4 of the nutrients
* Day 5 - Add 1/4 of the honey
* Day 6 - Add 1/4 of the nutrients
* Day 7 - Add the last of the honey
* Day 8 - Add the last of the nutrients

I plan to degass every day until day ten or so.

I am planning on using Lalvin 71b-1122 for my yeast. I believe it has an alcohol tolerance of around 14%. Is there anything special I need to do to make sure my mead gets into the 12%-14% range? Also, check it before each day that I add honey, check it after I add the honey, and the difference should be added to the OG? When I do check the gravity (for the method I am using, it will be quite a few times in the first week), can I add the must back to the fermenter (as long as everything is properly sanitized each time)?

I have also heard that maltodextrin, and use that to backsweeten? 

My first batch, coupled with the fact basically ran them to completion, made for a very bland mead (almost no honey flavor, almost like alcoholic water) since they were just sack meads with nothing else. Could it benefit from tannins, or using a mixture of honey and maltodextrin to backsweeten?

If I use a juice of some sort instead of water, and put that amount into the mead calculator as plain sugar to help with calculating everything?

I want to try a chocolate mead, I have concluded that cocoa nibs are way better to use than cocoa powder. However, I havnt the slightest idea how much cocoa powder corresponds to one nib, or how much chocolate flavor I would get from a given amount of nibs. Is there any sort of guideline for this? I havnt checked the compleat meadmaker yet but I do not really remember seeing anything like that in there.

Nektar bourbon barrel mead a few years ago when they came out with the first batch and really liked it plus I have started to become more of bourbon barrel aged fan in my beer too.  I have been thinking of making a bourbon barrel aged mead for some time but never really had the time until now.  

Now, and age it for about 2 years I am going to have to do a shortcut method to get the flavor profile I want.  I pieced some of this together based on some recipes I found using bourbon barrel beers and I think this should work.  Here is what I have so far...

Recipe:

* Batch Size: 6 gallons 
* Target SG:  1.108
* Target FG:  1.010 (Want to keep some sweet in there)
* 18# Wildflower (I found an old recipe where they used a 4.8:1 ratio of orange blossom to buckwheat but I was thinking wildflower would be interesting unless someone else has any ideas)

Secondary:

* 16 oz Bourbon (haven't decided which one yet
* 2 oz toasted American Oak cubes that has been soaking for ~2 weeks
* Keep in secondary for ~ 1-2 weeks and rack off

What are your thoughts on this one?  

I am also thinking it might be interesting to substitute scotch for bourbon and make a scotched mead.

Process:
I poured the honey and the water into a pot and brought it up to 170 degrees for 15 minutes while stirring. After that I let it cool to room temperature. I took out a cup or two of the must and mixed the yeast into it for a couple minutes. I then poured the yeast mix into the 1 gallon carboy followed by the remainder of the must. I then airlocked it and stored it in a cool dry place for 8 weeks. After the 8 week wait I siphoned the mead into mason jars and put them in the refrigerator. I tried it immediately and quite liked it. If I had to liken it to something I would say it was fairly similar to Strongbow hard cider with a little less of the cider taste.

1. Is the process I followed a good process (for now I'm more focused on a speedy process

3. How much of the fruit should I use and how should I prep it? (I was thinking I would get it tomorrow

Yesterday

I have no experience with kegging and the friend helping me only has limited experience with kegging beer.  I'm looking for advice on the procedure for getting some good carbonation in it and at what psi/bar to dispense it.

We put 20psi/1.4b on it to seal the keg.  There was some talk of rolling the keg around.  Is that a thing?  

The keg will be stored in 65-75F/18-24C for at least 6 months before I try it again.  Should I change the pressure in the keg?
   
Serving pressure recommendation?

I suggest following a typical SNA schedule. I only added a small bit of nutrient after pitching and some energizer when it was about 2/3 of the way done. I still have not racked this mead after 7 weeks, but also because it turned out exactly as I was expecting - I even guessed my final grav on the nose on brew day. Part of what must be making this mead so good is the quality of the honey. The clover was just store bought processed stuff but the 2.5 pounds of wildflower were purchased from a farmers market and had to be the best honey I've tasted yet - so make sure you get good stuff!

I started a blueberry melomel about 3-4 months ago and after the yeast had dried it up nicely and started to die off due to high alcohol content ~17% (Lalvin EC-1118). I racked and backsweeted with about 12 oz of honey and a handful of blueberries to the gallon. After letting it sit for about a month and a half it was marvelously dark purple and clear. I then wait a few more weeks just to make sure it was done throwing off sediment and racked it to a new container for its final wait to be bottled. Its been about a week now and the bottom of the jug is still completely bare of sediment and the fermentation has long since stopped. However when the container is shaken or disturbed it kicks up a just a little bit barely pushing off a bubble or two for a few seconds after. 

I am wondering how you guys make sure that a fermentation is complete so you don't end up with a sticky explosion or unintentional champagne. My finishing gravity is about 1.031 and its been sitting at that for some time. I am extra weary since I plan to bottle this with plenty of fermentable sugars left. I do not want to use chemicals on my mead like sulfates/ites. Any advice from experienced mead makers?

5 gallons apple juice from concentrate

10lb clover honey

Montrachet Yeast

Nutrients (Fermaid K or other)



Ferment until it clears completely


My understanding is that this would yield around 17% abv, after which it is drinkable, but it improves a lot with as much as 6 months of aging. I would like a product that is drinkable as soon as possible (preferably within few months) My understanding is that adding honey would significantly increase the required aging time, but this could be minimized by decreasing the abv which could be done by decreasing the amount of honey to something like 5lb.

I am curious: Does the cloudiness effect the ultimate flavour of the mead? When I have sampled a cup or two during re-racking, but I always think that there is some sort of ghostly taste hiding in there from the cloudy particulate matter floating about.


So


* Does reddit have an opinion on cloudy -vs- clear in terms of ultimate mead taste?


-and-

[Here’s the Album of all five pictures I took during](http://imgur.com/a/adHba)

I bought some 6-gallon better bottles in the fall when I saw a by-one-get-one, so this weekend I went to a HBS (sadly, I can't really call it a Local HBS as it's a half hour away) to get a 5 Gal, and stopped in at a Tea &amp; spice store for my spices.
(I will be adding the spices in secondary)

The Recipe in Primary: 

* 1 Gallon of Meadowfoam Honey 
* 1 Gallon of Queen Anne’s Lace Honey (about 7-8 pounds were used
* Filtered water to 5 gallons (next time
* SNA that will total 5Tsp of DAP and 2.5Tsp of Yeast Energizer

Spice Additions for Secondary

* 1 Ounce of Green Cardamom
* 1 Ounce of “true” Ceylon Cinnamon
* 1 Whole nut of Nutmeg (probably not going to use the whole thing)


Process:

* Measure and mark the levels of each gallon on the 5 gallon Better Bottle
* Clean &amp; Sanitize everything. 
* Filter 4 gallons of water into the 5’gal. (same water that I drink regularly, next time I’ll probably buy bottled water to save time)
* Warm a large pot of water to 110º F &amp; warm the Meadowfoam honey to make it easier to pour through funnel into the 6’Gal
* While waiting for the last quarter of the first gallon of honey to go through the funnel
* Warm a half-gallon of filtered water to 110ºF
*Add the rest of the warmed (now slightly less than 100ºF) water
* Boil a half cup of filtered water, let cool to 105ºF, add yeast as per directions on 71B yeast packet for re-hydrating, and let it sit until I’m ready to pitch. 
* After a couple minutes of stirring, take first Gravity reading, which came in expectedly low, add QA honey to approximately 19lbs total. Add a bit more water (over shot my 5-gal mark while trying to wash as much of the honey off of the funnel into the fermenter) Mix and re-sample, reach gravity of 1.134 @ 80.8ºF and call it good enough.
* Add first SNA addition of 1Tsp DAP &amp; 1/2Tsp Yeast Energizer, pitch Yeast (foamy little buggers), move to where it’s going to live until secondary, Cap and Airlock.


SNA Additions:

* Second 8/5/13: 1Tsp DAP
* Third 8/6/13: 1Tsp DAP
* Fourth 8/7/13: 1Tsp DAP, for about 15 minutes, until very little pressure was being released. (no must lost, will continue to use this method rather than the drill... also easier to clean up before &amp; after as there are fewer things that come in contact with the carboy and must, so less sanitization is needed).",,False,t5_2rcsz,True

Cappings are the mixture of honey and beeswax that you get when you shave the combs off the frames. My question to you is whether or not it is possible to use this for making mead.

My plan at the moment goes like this:

1. Put cappings in a fine mesh bag and soak in tepid (~20C) water for a few days to dissolve the honey.

2. Remove bag of wax and set aside for refining for candles.

3. Supplement resulting must with honey to adjust SG (if necessary).

How I got here was due to two key events, cocoa, peppermint, yeast nutrients/energizer and was waiting for the yeast's rehydration water to cool to 110 when I found out my dad had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. So I put the air lock on the mead and planned to return in a few hours and pitch the mead. However, the second mistake was not putting any water in the airlock.

I've just returned

My first thought was to suck off the gross stuff with a shop vac and resterilize the must with a quick boil

Perhaps the dead yeast hulls in the nutrients came back to life and I now have Zombie Mead?!

my primary fermented like a mad house for 4 days and stopped, onto new fruit. I took a gravity reading of 0.993 before the new fruit, forgot to check after the fruit because I'm a genius like that. I decided to try something, and rather than just using whole frozen/thawed blueberries, I put them through my (properly sanitized) blender so that they wouldn't do their floaty trick and cause further airlock blow-outs/overflow, figuring that I can run my final product through some cheese cloth to remove the fruit bits when I re-rack later. hope that works out as planned, if not

I'm looking to make a nice blackberry mead (I believe it's a melomel technically). How much honey should I use per gallon? I see some recipes with far more honey than others. Some say not clover honey

How much blackberry should I use? Would it be better to use whole blackberries or a jam with the only ingredients being blackberry and cane sugar (organic)? Perhaps some of both would be best?

Some recipes seem to get it all together in a bottle

My rough idea of how to proceed is as follows:

1) heat some water and dissolve honey and maybe blackberry juice or jam.

2) fill carboy with more water up to 6gal

3) add blackberry fruit

4) add (how much?) yeast (EC 1118 I think was the one suggested

5) add [DAP](http://www.hillbillystills.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ADDMON&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_medium=shoppingengine) and [Fermaid K](http://www.bacchus-barleycorn.com/catalog/fermaid-k-fermentation-nutrient-2-oz-p-4771.html?utm_source=googprod&amp;utm_term=25535) (how much?)

1330658854.0,qdyia,Started my exchange mead finally,sunburnt,6,0,10,"Seeing how the deadline is today

I'm making two batches because I don't want to send out crap. So

**Batch #1: J^2 OAM: Juniper JOAM (1 gal)**

(The name is a work in progress. :P)

This is my safe bet. I just sampled a JOAM I made with Lalvin D47 in December

* 3 lbs of Great Lakes clover honey [from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Lakes-Select-32-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B001E5DZRU/).
* 1 whole orange cut up into eights with skin and all.
* 1 cinamon stick
* 25-26 raisins
* 8 dried juniper berries (crushed)
* 1/2 packet of Lalvin D47 re-hydrated per instructions on the packet.

**Batch #2: Juniper Something Mead (1 gal)**

* 3 lbs of honey
* 25-26 raisins (for nutrient)
* 8 dried juniper berries (crushed)
* A pinch of yeast nutrient dissolved in boiling water
* 1/2 packet of Lalvin D47 re-hydrated per instructions on the packet.

**Process**

The same process was used for both batches. Honey was left in hot (out of the tap) water to become less viscous. Fruit and equipment where sanitized in StarSan. Fruit was added first, which served to aerate the must. Yeast was re-hydrated and pitched. Airlock with StarSan affixed.

The best I can do is ferment it around 68-72F. Hopefully this will not be a problem.

**Questions**

1) Some mazers here think that 8 juniper berries is a bit much

2) Obviously I haven't decided yet what to do with batch #2. Part of me wants to do a straight-up juniper mead, or hops to secondary. One particular idea I had was dry-hopping with Centennial hops, which should add a citrus and floral aroma without any of the bitterness or flavor of citrus. 

2a) I'm also considering ""dry-hopping"" batch #2 with mint. Do you think the pine of the juniper berries might be too much with mint?

2b) If I add berries (they'll be the frozen kind from the grocery store)

My question is pretty simple but I want to do it right. How do I go about bottling it? There is some sediment at the bottom and some small amount of stuff floating at the top (doesn't look like much more than dead yeast that didn't sink). Obviously I don't want that stuff in my bottles. I'd also like to know if there is any adverse effect to adding some honey to it (to sweeten it up a bit) in the bottles.
