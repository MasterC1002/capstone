1322940080.0,myxtw,"I taught my students the real definition of ""Fair"" and my world has CHANGED!!!",jbooten,1469,338,264,"I am a first year Teach For America teacher in the Midwest. I teach 5th grade language arts at a mastery based

Our student population (40 5th graders and 45 6th graders) is quite diverse. They have come from over 30 different schools in our area, far ahead in achievement, behavior issues, etc. Our population is 88% free and reduced lunch, and 70/30 ratioed black/white.

In my classes, and children everywhere in between.  This means that I have a LOT of differentiating to do - and this has created a divide amongst many of my students.  ""Ms. B!!"" they scream at me when I'm explaining homework, ""Why did Timmy get half a page of homework, and I got 2 FULL pages? That's just not fair!!!!""

I hit a breaking point at the beginning of last week

""Who can tell me what fair means?""
""It means treating everyone the same.""
""WRONG! You've just given me the definition of the word 'equal.' What does 'fair' mean?""
""We.... Don't know?""
""So then why do you say it to me ALL OF THE TIME?""

We then had a LONG discussion about fair meaning ""everyone gets what they need."" I explained that if the cafeteria was serving Peanut butter treating someone with a peanut allergy EQUALLY would mean that they would either eat the peanut butter and get sick or not eat that day, it finally dawned on the other half - ""oh, we all have strengths and weaknesses."" One of the higher leveled readers said ""Oh yeah, Ms. B. that would be like if I had to do all the math homework. It takes me forever because it's really hard!""

My classroom has TURNED AROUND. My students want to help each other now. Lower leveled students want to work harder to prove they can do all of the homework

**Tl;dr I taught my students the correct definition of ""fair"" and my classroom culture has never been better!**

There are a number of variations to this activity, this is just how I do it. 

Last class period they read an article about the characteristics, what they would do about outsourcing, etc. It was awesome to see kids who don't normally talk in class actually get involved in the conversation. Very few kids were rude or disrespectful. The discussions were thought provoking and at the end the kids were disappointed that we didn't have more time in the class period to keep  talking. Some even asked ""Can we do this again? I really liked it.""

And you are sick of it.
And you are seriously thinking about leaving

I feel your pain.
I cannot know your individual trials and tribulations. Every classroom, an indicator of severe poverty. I am no expert and you can take my words with several containers of grains of salt. 
What I want to say to you is this:
A lot of you (student teachers) have **shite** mentors; they take the extra $500 a year to be a 'mentor', then fucking walk away, shaking their heads. Some are good, but mine (both of them) did it for the money plain and simple. They did more harm than good with me. What can you learn from this? 

Two things: first, they fart, you write that down. Try recording them. Set up a video camera on a tripod and put THAT in their face.

Second, the mousy little Spanish teacher whose students throw a birthday party for her like she's their mother. Then, FIND OUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND GIVE IT TO THEM. While they eat, drink or smoke it, LISTEN. The guy I learned from loved cigars. I bought them, we smoked them and I listened. Eleven years later, here I am

Some of you have problems keeping up with the grading. You have to grade 200, no time for sexy, just grade grade grade.


**Why would you do that?**


Seriously
Think about this and if it'll get you in trouble

But 
right now
 
**Half.**

Slow the hell down. Act like a pot-smoker; savor the good assignments and throw them up on the projector, see how she varied her subjects?' Talk about the best and the worst (without rancor!) and adjust what they're doing. Their basic skills are bad, their fundamentals suck? 
How is that your fault?
Hey, whose fault is that? 
And yeah
You can make their lives better AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK YOURSELF TO DEATH DOING IT.

So I stopped this guy and said ""Read the paragraph to yourself.  Everyone just hang on a sec. Read it too if you all want.  Good? Ready? Okay. Now **SAY IT LIKE A PIRATE.  ACT**.

This got a few ""Mr. Trombone are you off your rocker"" type remarks and giggles

This is the greatest idea I ever had.  Don't read things.  ACT.  The fact that they had to read, some of them they chose.  The kids were **remembering** very well though, and that's what I wanted.  I wanted a book definition as well as a personal definition in their head, since this was all for AP testing.  Sometimes I had to correct them because the syntax of yoda might not get the correct definition from a book. The principal loved this when he came into my room one day.  I had him impersonate Bill Clinton and read a bit. 

I think that we built a better class connection too.  We found new talents in many of the students.  Some kids have amazing impersonation abilities.  Some are really good with just a couple of accents.  Some kids asked if they could sing the sentences.  It became an amazing thing

I had one kid do an interpretive dance.  I don't know if I'd allow that again

Truly the greatest idea I've had recently.

Ok


Not to say it's entirely her problem. that kid can't keep his dick off your daughter. 


Neither of these kids does shit anywhere around our school except feel each other up. They do it in the class that leads up to mine, and they do it in the class that follows lunch. After school your daughter and her boyfriend hide in the bushes and feel each other up


When we catch them in the bushes, during class and during lunch, and every. single. one of us has talked with your daughter and her boyfriend about their behavior.  And I believe this has been brought to your attention before.


But guess what? They're both very intelligent kids. 


Moreso than you'd expect. Know why? Because your angry email complaining about how we've neglected to keep you in the loop about this and how your daughter is going to go down the tubes gradewise (now that this schedule change has taken place) shows that she's obviously conned you into believing she's a victim in this situation. 


And when I say your daughter is smart, because she is actually able to do it. 


While the majority of the other kids are sitting around just trying to wrap their heads around the concepts we teach


But in the meantime, and she's losing the skills she once acquired. She seems to think I (and a few of her other teachers) are actually going to mistake her ability to string a few words together as competence, and that we'll pass her on. But we're not buying that. That's why we moved her. We don't want that bullshit in our school. We don't want that bullshit in our classrooms. We don't want that bullshit from anyone. 


You fell for it


She's obviously been telling you she's struggling in her classes and that we don't help. She's obviously been telling you she doesn't get what we're talking about and that she's afraid to ask us for help. She's obviously got you conned into believing she was in the perfect situation and that she was about to make a turnaround


Don't worry though -- she will pass on. She will pass on to the next grade and the grade after and she will sneak her way through a few classes, and she'll blame all that again on her teachers. 


By now you're probably wondering why it is I haven't addressed the whole issue of not contacting you about this beforehand. You're wondering why I haven't called you to talk about your daughter's behaviors here at school and the way she conducts herself with this boy. Here's why: I have over 150 students every day and the majority of them come to school struggling with much deeper problems than the possible pregnancy your daughter has on deck. I have students who do not live in homes. I have students who struggle to find food every day to eat. I have students with severe physical and cognitive disabilities. I have students who go home each night and make sure their parents and siblings have dinner. I have students who canot read despite their very best efforts. I have students who are addicted to drugs. I have students who cannot help but shit their pants when they get nervous. I have students who are sick and diseased. I have students whose parents have taught them to lie cheat and steal their way through school. I have students whose parents involve in robberies. I have students who get in knife fights and drive-bys. I have students who joined a boxing community so that they don't take out their aggression on their teachers any more. I have students whose parents impose religion, and other beliefs upon them. I have students who do not sleep more than a few hours a week. I have students who go home every night only to be abused in a myriad physical, sexual, and mental manner by their siblings and relatives and they are expected to come back to it again day after day, lest they receive another punishment. I have students whose parents skip out for months at a time and lie about coming back. I have students who wait four hours every day at the front door of our school hoping one of their parents shows, but often end up walking home in the dark. I have students who have jobs after school. I have students who have built a fort inside some trees not far from school because that's the only place they have to go when things get bad. I have students who will die before they even make it to high school, and they are acutely aware of it. They don't have time to be in love.


I have 150 kids like that.  


So does the other English teacher because we don't share students. 


There are another 400 kids at the grade level below us and another 400 at the grade level below that and every single one of those kids probably has it worse off than your daughter whose 5th period English and 6th period math classes are being switched. 


Maybe I'm wrong


Thanks

About six years ago, she made us memorize a speech from Henry V, beginning ""we few, we happy few, we band of brothers"" and so on, for a couple of lines. I was really annoyed with her for making us memorize it, and told her so. Told her that it was pointless, not education. She told me that one day it could come in useful

Six years later

 In one class, but it's beautiful!"" And she went on to say that it reminds you that you're never alone. ""I can't remember it, but.."" and she told us that we should know it, told one student that he had to hear it someday. 

And we didn't have supplies, because I had the whole speech in my head, to tell her and to tell the class. 

My question is: should I write to my old teacher to tell her this story? I'm honestly tempted to do it. I think maybe it would be nice for her to hear. On the other hand

I've never taught before this

My problem is that **I don't know how to make proper lesson plans or control the class.**

I've been trying everything I can think of for a few weeks now, and I spend half the class trying to get started, calm them down, etc.

When an administrator comes by, but I can't kick every kid out every time they wont stop talking, especially since there are always at least 5 people talking.  The second I go to ask one to stop talking, another starts and I get answers like ""he's also talking""

Whats worse, or completed in under half the class.  (Also occupying them when/if they do the work I prepared more quickly than anticipated is an issue).

* **Are there any resources where I can learn how to plan teaching units and individual lessons within those units.** (without spending a fortune).

* **Are there any resources/advice for classroom management and regaining control?**

* **Is teaching something I can learn fast enough to actually teach these kids so they don't lose a year of English

* **In trying to find what works, etc.  Where can I find a good list of rules that I can enforce, and what are the appropriate consequences?**

Is there any hope?  If so

Also of note: I've watched EVERY single movie I can find on teaching, which usually don't work.  So if you do recommend a book, it needs to be a really awesome book!


Any help that you can give will be greatly appreciated!

**UPDATE - January 2nd - Started back today**

**The advice here so far seems fantastic

I have no set curriculum, and there is really only one other teacher in the school who tries to help.

I try my best to make sure what we learn is building in some way off something else we learned

Though the advice of this other teacher is fantastic, and I don't have his personality type to do exactly everything he says. (Our schedules also don't match up, so I've only really gotten to speak to him at length once or twice when he was kind enough to stay after and answer some of my questions, though I'll admit I don't even know the right questions to ask).

He also set up all of his perfect rules on the first day

**Today I tried implementing classroom rules. It was utter mayhem.** All of my students behaved ten times worse than usual, I will not"" and left.

Then while trying to get people back in their seats, ask more kids to sit down, kids would go back to the desk, pick up the markers behind my back and start throwing them. They told me these rules wont work, why am I trying, there was more talking than usual, and I literally spent all period reviewing 5 basic rules (like raising your hand to speak, etc.)

Two kids even managed to pull one of the desks apart while I was stopping two other kids from hitting each other. I asked another kid to sit down

I asked four kids to please stop doing their math homework and pay attention to the lesson, they refused, so I had to go over and take them out of their hands, and they almost fought me. Later in the class they had a friend near the front reach onto my desk and get them back while I wasn't looking, at which point I noticed them, I took them back, put them in my briefcase, but its not being done in my class. (The vice principal came to my next class to get them back saying I shouldn't do that

I can almost guarantee you that had I have known some of these things (that perhaps you aren't taught in college) I would have had a much less stressful rookie year.

*Please add on to the list everyone!*

1.Come up with a simple method of grading homework (ex. don't grade every single problem...it will consume you.

2. Rubrics..Rubrics..Rubrics. At least have some method of grading or a model BEFORE students turn in their assignments. There is nothing worse than a pile of papers that have all veered in different directions and then you have to figure out what the hell to do. Rubrics give me the evidence I need to be able to sleep at night.

3. Don't bitch with others just because they are bitching...people complain A WHOLE LOT at school....if you join in you view the entire school as a negative environment...simply walk away.

4. Have a place to put extra copies of past work. When a student is absent they know where to get the copies...and you don't have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off because you can't find a copy/have to print one out...during class.

5. Understand that you can only help students that will accept it. If they aren't at least a little bit invested then there is little you can do to help them succeed. This does not mean give up on students

6. One night a week leave the building and all of your work at the sound of the bell (or when you can contractually leave). And also do not feel guilty about doing this...remember this is a job...a unique one...but still a job..and you cannot always be focused on it. You need to remember to relax and enjoy life if you are going to reach your potential in this career.

7. On the night of parent conferences

8. Know what you want students to learn out of a lesson before you teach it...it avoids a boring lesson/waste of everyone's time.

9. Understand that this job is one that is very unique and you deal with individuals from all different walks of life. Try to not hold a grudge against a student for a previous action they have done. Just as they are learning academics,False,self,t5_2qyj9,False,,,t3_178d06

It's 7:30 and you've arrived at school

It's 8, warm-up time? That really depends but how are you going to ensure the students are doing their work and more importantly learning from doing their own work? Quiz them, talk to them, have them make a poster, test them? The goal is that they learn, not have fun, but it can happen that the learning becomes fun.

It's 8:20 Billy is loud, you have 29 other students who want to learn, and one Billy, what do you do? Did your lesson call for this, did you call for this, were you not engaging enough, should you call the students parents, talk to him one on one. That's a choice

8:55, got the homework down, and cleaned up. Cleaned up. If the first period leaves a mess, so will the next four. Have them clean up. 4 minutes till next period, are you prepared, do you teach another class (ex: teaching world history then US history). Go outside and greet students at door.

8:59 Repeating your first lesson? You should be more prepared this time.
BRUNCH

9:58 And Better this time.

10:57 And better this......no wait, talked with admin if you have any business with them (class observations/referrals/ideas for school). Try to relax a little, maybe stretch or exercise. You might even do a class observation or two to see what new ideas the other teachers are using in their classroom. You want your class to be interdisciplinary after all. Time flies, but you're lucky if your prep period is right before...

11:52 Lunch time. Are you having students come in to speak with you, do you have test to grade in the meantime, an email to look at, are you even relaxing?

12:40 Lunch is over

1:39 Last class of the day...maybe, you have to plan for that, but no matter after this class it's time for...

2:35 After school students help/tutoring/responding to parent emails/meeting with parents/meeting with staff members and faculty/making for a special ed student meeting (look up IEP and 504 if you want to understand)/department meetings. If you're still at school at 4

4:00 planning for the next day, reflecting on the day. You're grading for 5 classes ( you get one off, but really you're working then to). By the way, you don't run a club do you?

6:00 Yes 6:00, websites updated, lessons planed, attendance took, parents called) then it's time to go home. Maybe this doesn't happen every day, but it'll happen more often than not. What's home like? Good? You did the grocery shopping and the wife is happy, can you play with the kids? Let's hope you have the energy. You're single now, not too far

10 Sleep. Hopefully. That one thing that you could have done differently to change a student’s life is nagging you. Come on sleep...sleep darn it

And I would say that's the typical day of a teacher, you have to be dedicated, and if the money is not good enough add extra tutoring to that 5 to 7 o'clock gap to make up the extra money.

PS I'm sure people care about the grammar

One of my students loudly commented, mean, and sounds hateful.  He became outraged and yelled out ""I only said, retarded, you don't have to get so mad.""  I told him not to say it anymore, he expressed confusion by saying ""retarded"" several time, so I pulled him to the side and explained that its a mean word that people use to describe others - like a racial slur or a ethnic slur.  It isn't nice and shouldn't be used.  He cried

Now, he blurted out that he was upset to not see his ""favorite"" part of 9/11, the planes crashing into the towers.  I had to pull him to the side then, too.

Anyway

Anyway, as if I didn't already know.  At this point, the dean of the school came in and talked to them about how missing recess was actually a very mild punishment, as I could have written him a referral to our office.  They weren't happy when she explained that ""bitch"" is also in the dictionary - but is still not acceptable at school.  They then got huffy and asked what they're supposed to call those kids - to which I replied ""either children, kids, or students.""

***It is a huge pain in the ass to set-up at the beginning of the year

At the beginning of the year I hand out my syllabus with a form on the back for parents to fill out their contact information. It has standard information on it like...

* Who do you live with?
* What is their phone number?
* What is their e-mail? 
* Do they speak English? (40% at my school don't)

In order to get kids to do this

1. I will give them points for it. I make it a 20 point assignment which is a pretty significant grade. Very easy points to start off the beginning of the year.

2. I tell them I will call or e-mail home and say something about what a good student they are to their parents. (This is tough as sometimes they are already a nightmare)

This way the kids are eager to hand over all of this information.

Once I get the information back
 
I then e-mail all the parents I can to say something nice and I attempt to call the rest.

-------------------

I have had A LOT of parents contact me saying that I am the only teacher that is ever in touch with them. I have even had two write to the school Principal about how well I communicate. With no tenure

Here are somethings that I e-mail home about....


* **Missing Work?** E-mail home to the parents and attach the assignments to the e-mail (this takes a while because you have to do it individually

* **Pop Quiz/Test coming up?** E-mail the parents and tell them exactly what their kid needs to study (I was surprised how many kids came in ""upset"" because their parents made them study

* **Grades Posted/Updated?** Send out an e-mail letting them know to check online

* **Important Date/Deadline Coming Up?** Send out e-mail reminders to all the parents. I sent out probably 10 e-mails leading up to open house and a field trip and I had the highest turn out rate in my school.

* **Homework Assignment?** E-mail home and let the parents know. Most kids will lie and say they don't have anything due.

* **Kid acting out in class?** E-mail home to the parent. I used to hate having to stop my class to call home when a kid was being a total ass. Once your students know that you e-mail home CONSTANTLY

I probably spend at most

And if the parents don't speak English? At the bottom in my signature I have a link to Google Translate in Spanish that says ""If you do not speak English please click here to translate"".

1357695989.0,167yrq,Hello Reddit Educators! My name is Brian Fediuk. I am working on a side project that offers free guides for teachers to set up a website for their classroom. Care to help?,brianfediuk,33,9,9,"Greetings, I am developing guides for the following types of classroom websites:

**Content Management System** - Well rounded environment, a file repository, etc. Advanced uses include a registered-user-only website where students have a live chat, online storage for their files(backup and/or handing in work), commenting sections as a ticket out the door, user profiles, and much much more

**Blog** - A blogging system allows a teacher to post blog posts for his or her classroom daily, or whatever, for their students read and add a response. Also allows for students to make their own posts to the blog to generate discussion

**Wiki** - Collaborative system where the class makes

**Discussion Board** - Students use a message forum to discuss material related to the class. Great for homework

Now, advice, preferences, or anything else that you might think could be valuable to the development of this website as a resource to teachers. My overall goal is to contribute to the educational world not only through my teaching, but also offer a little something to get non-technology savvy teachers into the technology world, even if they have to follow a step-by-step guide.

Finally

If you have any questions

I went to college 20+ years ago to become a science teacher

Flash forward to now...20 years of a career I more or less hated; one which has left me jobless and with no prospects for future employment.  I have a wonderful wife

I am going to walk away from the home...because keeping it, yes, in great part because I am probably going to lose it anyway) to chase down a dream.  

The idea hit me a few weeks ago: I am going to go back to school, and then I am going to teach high school science.  

Why these disciplines?  Because they are my life's passion.  As a kid, bugs, leaves, mushrooms, snakes....you name it, I collected it, caught it or killed it.  This is a hobby that continues to this day...with the catching being very temporary and the killing replaced by photography.  

I know it's crazy as hell to make such a drastic change at this point in my life.  And I know I will not get rich as a school teacher. But fact is...I do not care.  I am tired of playing the game of attempting to accumulate wealth and possessions purely for the sake of it. I'm only really happy when I am walking in the woods with my kids

My wife supports me...my kids will probably hate me at first...but they are still young

I am going to go back to school

And I have not been as excited about life since I was

Wish me luck.

Hurricane Sandy just happened to coincide with a unit on persuasive writing.  (High school English)

I explained to students that there were two viewpoints in times of natural disasters that affected more than one state.  One is that the government should step in, which were amazing.)  Then we worked through pros and cons for each, and they were to use our class brainstorming to take a position and write about it.

In one of my classes a bold youngster asked me who I was voting for.  Before I could even react, that he was not allowed to ask a teacher that.  (I had no idea that was a rule, but to them it was.)

It was, ""Everyone's vote is private!""  Another said, ""You shouldn't ask anyone!  Not even your friends!  It's disrespectful!""

The general response among them seemed to be that this was a major faux pas, I thought.  I thanked the student for asking, but told him that I preferred to keep my preferences private.

At our school, students who have many tardies face more severe consequences, so they avoid getting the tardy passes and instead try to sneak into class although they are late, or just skip class after being asked to get a tardy pass.

So today, I tell them to go get a pass and they stop briefly, start cussing at me, and then push me/shove me down so they can get into the room. After I almost fall and hit my head they rush to their seats, giggling/laughing and refusing to leave the room and comply with my requests to get a pass.

I've taught here for a while and I've never had a student put his/her hands on me. That's a line even the toughest students typically do not cross

I call the dean to have them removed and they come down; I write factual referrals for all the students involved. Later in the period, which didn't happen. She asked if they could come back to my class. I wasn't comfortable with that since this group of students is very argumentative/confrontational, and I also feel they would not perceive their actions as having any consequences. So they were assigned cafeteria cleanup duty just for the next 20 minutes, and as far as I can tell no other consequences.

** Pedophilia Paranoia**

I frequently hear the subtext of pedophila in jokes/conversations*. 

* Massachusetts requires all teachers to undergo a criminal background check. Mine has taken longer than usual, maybe it's because you're a pedophile."" My supervisor remarked, ""Maybe you have a dirty background.""

*  I work with autistic students who like to ""cuddle."" Although I think physical contact is important for children

* An older, ""You think so?"" She replied, ""Are you kidding? They're all over you."" I later learned that **she says this to all the male staff**. I now try to minimize my contact with female students. 

**Bureaucratic Red Tape**

The bureaucratic efficiency of public schools verges on absurdity. Examples:

* **Certification/licensure** US public schools require certification/licensure to teach. The problem is that they're unclear about what this means. Over the last four years, or an MED, or complete the MTEL (a test required to get a certificate). When I talk to other teachers, they're unclear about the differences between these programs.


* **Background Check (BC)** - It has taken over a month for my BC to clear. Until then, I called the BC government department, only to learn that there was a miscommunication (not sure why, yet) and that my BC was sent to one of my schools THREE WEKS AGO. They finally recognized the error this morning.

* **Payroll** When I began teaching

**Prestige**

Friends and family don't regard teaching as a worth-while career. When I told my mother that I was going to be a teacher, do. Those who can't, teach."" 

**Career Advancement**

Once I become a full-time teacher

**Salary**

I don't need to beat that dead horse.

**TL;DR:** There are many reasons why a qualified male would hesitate to go into teaching. 

**Edit Note:** I previously wrote that I constantly receive comments that I'm a pedofile. This language is too strong

Is it really my job to motivate them all to work? My last class a student said that my class was ""boring"". Well, unless, you actually have passion about programming (as the majority of the class does). I've spent a long time designing my course and I know the other students are benefitting but I refuse to act like a babysitter. Today one student asked if she could leave early (after finishing the assignments with the minimum amount of work required) and I simply stated that she can always leave any time she wants. She's an adult now, and not in high school anymore. If you want to leave my class, then leave :D And the same goes for students who miss assignments. Is it really my job to hunt them down, and make sure they get everything in on time? Or should they just read the syllabus and turn everything in correctly as the vast majority of students do.

I don't want to come off as cold and uncaring. I'm not in the least and I'll spend an hour after class with a student if he's passionate about learning. The thing I find strange however is that so many teachers are teaching at a pre-college level, and society deems them an adult I couldn't care less about motivating those who clearly aren't motivating themselves. 

Does that make me a terrible teacher? 

Also I'm interested in how fun should every class should be. Sure, but I don't know if it's necessarily always supposed to be fun. I'm sorry but I just don't think it's a teachers duty to keep students entertained. I can't help but think this is a cultural phenomenon. I can't imagine a student in South Korea asking a professor if he could make his lessons more ""fun"" :D

It's been a miserable experience and I'm finally realizing that this isn't for me at all.

Teaching has always been a back up for me and I've never been particularly interested in it. I just picked it up and for whatever reason decided to stick with it. I've made no friends in the program (all of my friends are taking up other studies at the university), I've realized the mistake I've made. 

I have no interest in kids. I'm not passionate about helping them. I don't care much for my concentration (math). In the beginning it seemed like a decent backup because of the vacation hours and I had a blast when I was in high school fucking around with my teachers. I've now realized that I was interested in all the wrong things with the profession. I was looking at the rewards and not the job itself.

She tells me: ""He doesn't know any English"" and I say: ""Then why on earth is he in an advanced English class?""

I am given $500 at the end of each year to spend on my class by the school but as I think many of you might know, birthdays, and now Easter, I've been buying things from the dollar-store or Walmart to make goody bags for the kids.  Things like tissues and baby wipes are used up SO quickly and even when I request donations to be made by parents, most of them don't send anything in.  Books I have are mostly used, old, and get torn easily - especially by some of my rough boys.  A lot of my spending goes towards those things.

So

Anyway, I just want to vent!  But your feedback is appreciated!

Concern #1:  My cooperating teacher (CT) told me in my first week that

Concern #2:  My CT told me that she once had to fire a student teacher

Concern #3:  I have to attend PLC meetings, I feel like I'm reporting to multiple teachers with different expectations.  Just adds to the stress.

Concern #4:  My CT is often difficult to understand, because communication is not always clear.  CT tends to speak very fast and while performing other tasks, making it hard to pick up everything.

Concern #5:   I recently had a PLC meeting (a.k.a. Hell), but had a few ""mistakes,"" all of which were minor and a result of misunderstanding what the two teachers had agreed upon.  So, anyway, my cooperating teacher notices the ""mistakes,"" which were really just minor misunderstandings (very understandable in a PLC meeting with two teachers that don't necessarily agree upon or understand the material in the first place), and asks me the following:  ""Don't take this the wrong way, I was completely deflated.  After becoming pretty much silent, when you get silent like that

Concern #6:  There have been several instances where my CT has ""corrected"" me on things which were not incorrect.  For example, which is based on the Common Core Standards!  This has been a recurring thing.  I don't know how to deal with being corrected when I am presenting information about the content correctly because the CT is misinformed or confused.  

Concern #7:  CT is a bit harsh and sarcastic at times

Question #1:  Do you think it's normal to have this much stress at this point?

Question #2:  Do you have any suggestions for dealing with any of these concerns?

Question #3:  Do you think that maybe I'm just too sensitive for teaching?  Maybe I should just quit now.  I love the actual teaching

Question #4:  Any ideas for stress relief??  I think that I may possibly benefit from getting laid.

Thanks!

When I went to High School even if we didn't like the class or we didn't like the teacher

Where I'm student teaching most of my students simply refuse to do work 80% of the time. I will teach a chapter and have students feign paying attention and then when I do problems with them

At the end of one of my last units we had every student (with the exception of 3 total students across all 4 sections) missing 4 or more assignments. We called them up, a small number were all caught up, and most students said, and I quote, ""Dude, man! This is a lot of work! Can't we get like a work week or something?!"". A work week? You're asking for a  work week after you've just a week to do all your assignments and you sat there and did nothing instead? Not happening. 

Today I gave a Test to my third hour. They were told on Monday so start working on their study guides. On Wednesday they were given the day to work on their study guides. It was going to be 15 minutes working on your own, complained that it was unfair to have a test today when I ""just assigned the study guide yesterday"" and ""How were we supposed to study when you didn't give us the answers?"". They have two days to take a 40 questions test, and they got to use their books the last ten minutes today. This would have been unheard of in my High School, especially when the only reason they want more time is because of how lazy they are. They have seen every test question today, they know EXACTLY what to study. But tomorrow they will come in and beg and plead to use their books because they can't possible be bothered to learn anything on their own. 

I'm frustrated. I know this is a rant

It was one of the coolest presentations I've seen in a while. 

There is a free version, as well as a few other inconveniences.  For example, I am not yet sure if you can export these presentations for use in offline mode without the paid subscription, and that would limit the number of presentations you could make (so for example you may not be able to make a year's worth of presentations due to storage limitations and not being able to save them to a flash drive or hard drive).  I am not sure about this, I just have been messing around with it for a few hours.

3) Yell at them if they don't because no one has the book yet

4) Hand out a study guide with the following criteria

-Seriously

Teacher here.  I was wondering what you guys thought about explicitly teaching students that there is no evidence that god exists.  Is that necessarily a violation of separation of church and state?  Yes, stem cell research, gender equality, understanding evolution, etc.  Thus, wouldn't it be relevant, if not necessary to debunk supposed truths that students have learned in the past?  

Would simply saying, would I have the moral/legal high ground?  Would it be legal for schools to fire me for stating facts?

I feel like this is a logical conclusion.  Am I just a crazy person? ... well I am a teacher...

::EDIT::  Thank you all for providing different perspectives that I didn't take into account before.  I think I really need to clarify that I will NOT be doing this in the classroom.  I teach students with moderate to severe disabilities and I do not think that this level of thinking is appropriate for them. 

Second

Last (and hopefully this provides a clearer map to my logic): Some famous atheist once said that the sanctity of religion may be dangerous (saw it in reddit somewhere).  Why does religion get a special pass from facts?  If I am trying to teach about the criminal justice system I would teach about capital punishment.  Many people have strong beliefs about capital punishment, some may think that life in prison is more expensive than capital punishment (it’s not).  Some may say that capital punishment deters crime (it doesn’t).  So I HAVE to correct any misconceptions they may have even though it may conflict with personal beliefs.  What if I told my kids, ""Based off the current evidence presented to us by peer reviewed data, there is no evidence that thetans (Scientology term) exists.""

His response

Well

So I called his office. Very nice lady and I talked and I just asked her to pass along my greeting (he doesn't have voicemail. This is a state senator in the United States and he doesn't have voicemail?)

So I sent the following e-mail:

""Please, I'm just a voter, a Christian and a teacher. I don't mean to be rude and I am sure you have other things to do, but I really want to know what part of the the Bible influenced you to make that statement. If you were misquoted by the media, please explain that.""

After a day

""The underlining theme of my message that day was balance. **God said he weighted the hills and valleys on a scale when he created this world and why? Because he new that it would be spinning real fast and need to be in balance.** I said that Legislators don't need to make to much and they don't need to make to little both can lead to corruption and likewise **with teachers to raise someones children 8 to 10 hours a day I believe requires a calling and if you doubled a teachers pay  you would attract people who don't need to be teaching our children**. Never the less if you don't pay them enough then they might not enter the profession which calls for balance. Balance is the Biblical principle. I have also said many times that I hope and pray that the economy turns around in the near so that the state can afford to give teachers at ;least a cost of living raise.Legislatures were offered one last year and all republicans in the senate turned it down

Now
A voice of one calling:
“In the wilderness prepare
   the way for the LORD[a];
make straight in the desert
   a highway for our God.[b]
4 Every valley shall be raised up
   every mountain and hill made low;
the rough ground shall become level

1) Giving discipline points to misbehaving students. The school uses a points system that adds up for each student and awards consequences like detentions

2) Awarding positive points; The opposite of the discipline points. These take discipline points away and can even put a student into positive territory

3) Awarding after school detentions

4) Towards the end, students would be less bored and more likely to stay focused. Instead of having 30-40 minutes of notes followed by guided practice and an activity for the rest of class, now we might do notes for 15 minutes, an activity for 25, another activity for 30, and then practice.

Thank you for your time.

**Second Email**

I'm not concerned with giving him another opportunity to take the test again.

He insists he knows the material. I'd like to show him his tests with his answers and his grade. I think he needs to see that whether or not he knows the material

I want to go over his answers with him and show him they were not correct and that is why he has the grade he does.

I think giving him a second chance to retake tests/quizzes would show he doesn't have to do things right the first time.

A little history on [my son]: Up until August of last year he lived with his mother in Washington. He's had very little supervision and boundaries until he and his sister were transferred to my custody. Last year

He has not been reliable with getting his homework done and bringing home what he needs to. He is extremely reluctant to do homework or study at all. He may well attend summer school after this year but for now I need to show him you and I are not divided about what he needs to do.

He needs to see he is required to complete his work or pay the price

I can understand I've given you a lot to take in. I expect you have a few hundred students to worry about. For now

I've been having issues accessing the school's blackboard system. That should be resolved today. I'll use that to keep an eye on what he should be doing at home

I'm in a weird situation now where I work as an ELA and Science Interventionist. Can't say I've really been enjoying the experience of co-teaching; at least for my ELA class.

It was clear this guy didn't want me in his class and I really should've paid attention to the red flags from the start. Frequent lateness, not defining my role in the class, etc.

Our classes are the most consistently out-of-hand

Some of the other teachers at the school do know the situation and know that I basically got thrown into an awful situation with a guy who doesn't care and admitted that he's just doing this for the experience so that he can take that with him when he enters politics. They gave me some good advice

Which should be soon. It hit the fan today when he gave me one instruction in private and then told me to do the opposite of that in front of the kids. Later he ended up screaming at the kids, getting into a student's face and arguing back at her, it was horrible.

1374625764.0,1ix86f,[Assignment] Zombie apocalypse research paper,stanman312,12,0,7,"I'm currently working on my thesis

I have an idea

Here's the basic premise: It's a research paper that involves studying the infrastructure of a particular historical time/place (Ancient Egypt, etc.) and using that knowledge to write a Zombie Survival Guide for that era and location.

Research elements include (but aren't limited to) population density, public health, disease treatment/response systems, religious influence, etc. -- anything that they might find relevant for such a goal.  For their sources, they would use a mixture of academic material and books such as *The Zombie Survival Guide* by Max Brooks.

The research segment would be its own assignment (called a Threat Analysis Report) that they would complete before starting the larger assignment

Critique would be formatted as disaster reports, but would hopefully convey the information in a more interesting, thought-provoking way.  

A student who fails to address a high population density might receive one such comment: ""Any hope of mass evacuation quickly dissolve as the tangled

The idea I'm working with is that the *presentation* of information isn't as important as the *acquisition* and *application*.  Students who are uncomfortable with the notion of a ""silly"" research paper would

I've spent the last two years working on a computer program inspired by the touch screen interfaces on Star Trek.

**Touch Control System (TCS)**: A 3D game engine built for home automation

link: [http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/tcs](http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/tcs)

We are going to release an educational version of this software for free! 

Our hope is that by providing a hands-on learning experience with computer graphics and electronics hardware

We are working on several ""cool"" tech demos that we hope students of all ages will enjoy.

Here is a WiFi controlled robot:

Launching model rockets:
[http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/blog/launching-rockets/](http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/blog/launching-rockets/)

We can fly model helicopters around with TCS and recently added support for the [NeuroSky Mindwave](http://neurosky.com/Products/MindWave.aspx).

Using this program can get extremely technical and we plan to provide tutorials and instruction for everything from processing 1's and 0's to full-blown 3D graphics and user interaction. Any skills developed here will translate to other platforms and technologies easily.

Our plan is to get on Kickstarter to fully fund the development of this project.

Would any of you be interested in helping with the educational aspect of this project? We would love to work with anyone interested to develop structure for lesson plans, workshops, and anything else that would be useful in a learning environment.

We also need messages from educators stating the importance of this kind of hands-on learning and general ""Thumbs up! This is awesome!"" quotes that we could use for marketing purposes.

We're open to any comments or suggestions and welcome any questions or support!



Thanks for everything Teachers!

I'll spare you guys the long version of the story, so I was not previously an X Jurisdiction Public Schools employee. I was told by several administrators and the substitute office that this would not be a problem, and that, while I wouldn't start receiving paychecks until I was officially hired, I would be compensated fully for every day that I worked at the long-term substitute rate. I accepted the job with this understanding and began work pretty much instantaneously.

It took a little longer than the administrators and I had expected to get through the red tape of being hired by XJPS (which is gigantic). I had hoped to have it done last Wednesday

Yesterday I had a discussion with one of the administrators and she informed me that they were not going to be able to pay me, I won't receive a number until my background check, etc. is complete, so I don't anticipate receiving it until sometime next week. I said that that was not my understanding of our arrangement, and she said that when I started she thought that I would be able to be paid for all of my time, but it turns out it just wouldn't be possible, and that they were sorry. Basically, at all

We went around in circles for awhile and. I said that I felt I should inform her that if I wasn't compensated fully for my time that I would take legal action. (In retrospect I know that this might not have been the best idea, and I would get paid for everything after all, so no worries.

Guys, even this early in the year). I plan to write them a letter explaining my understanding of our arrangement (so that there's something in writing), and I plan to draw up timesheets today and have them signed by someone sufficiently important, but other than that I have no idea how to cover my ass.

""Hot for Teacher Syndrome"":
I'm sure it's my age

Lazy Students:
My most insane story with this one: had a student tell me I collected papers incorrectly.  My method: Make sure you turn your homework in to the tray before you leave. His complaint: You need to tell me what I'm turning in

Foreign Exchange Students:
It's always awkward when you use an American/English expression and it translates horribly.  I was a little annoyed one period.  Announced to my students not to push my buttons.  A German had a horrified look on her face until I explained what the expression meant.  She let me know that was ""reeeeaaallly perverted"" in German.

Windows:
Curse them!  They cause any child to have instant ADD when a bird flies by or the weather changes.  One period I had to stop class while students watched a helicopter for 10 minutes.

Creepers:
Students are weird, extremely interested in personal lives of their teachers.  At least in my case.  I threaten them the first day they meet me to leave me alone on social networking sites.  Nevertheless, I've had a student take it as a challenge to get my cell phone number.  Very few teachers have this number and I teach in a town few people know me (I commute 30 miles).  She somehow managed it!

The Lounge/ Staff Room:
Clean your shit out of the fridge.  I spent a good 20 minutes of my prep cleaning month old food out of dishes and the fridge.  One had a mysterious liquid and what appeared to be soggy cake floating around in it.  Made the room smell like vomit.

I am 28 years old and am currently working on my teaching certificate. I graduated from university in 2008 and never expected that I would be returning to become a high school teacher. Life happens, but is perhaps what I ultimately *should* be doing.

That being said, I am terrified of not having any income for five months while I complete student teaching.. 

I am in debt up to my ears and live in a small, I am single (have a boyfriend, but even if it lasts, living together will not be an option), and moving in with either of my parents is not an option. My siblings live states away. I don't have much in the way of money and while I am hopeful of getting some grant money for next year, I am not counting on it. 

Long story short, but I have heard that working during student teaching is not necessarily the best idea, either. A young (early thirties) teacher I know told me that while she did have a part time job during her semester of student teaching, she wonders how much better her lesson plans would have been had she not been working. She was also living with her parents. 

I really would like to try to land a teaching job next fall (2012) before I have to student teach in the spring of 2013, though, to be able to do my student teaching ""on the job."" Once again, however, I am not counting on this. 

So please, or just moral support, I would greatly appreciate it. How did you financially survive student teaching? What options do I have, besides loans, loans, and more loans? How the hell did you get hrough this??

I have a students who is coming in every day. I can tell she likes to be social, its like she is just out in her own little world. This sounds terrible but she seems like she is constantly high, but I don't think she is. It really looks like dyslexia or some sort of similar learning issue or like maybe she just hasn't woken up yet. She is definitely a strong willed and would be way more bossy I think if she actually understood what was actually happening. Yesterday she deliberately started ignoring me even when I was standing behind her and telling her to do something I needed from her. I do not ""yell"" at my students unless they do something stupidly dangerous. Even if it takes extra time I try to find a way to reach them and help them clue in to whats happening. I'm trying to find a way to get her excited and paying attention and not ignore when I'm talking to her. I don't want to just give her busy work to get her out of the way, I want to find something that has immediate feedback and helps wake her up and gets her going. Does anyone have any ideas?

Just for background I volunteer 10-20+ hours a week on top of a demanding full time job. I lead a technology outreach program team of 40+ students and work with about 20 individually on different days during the week on 3D animation, and chairmen's awards. The main group I lead has 5 students in it who complete 3d animations in 4-5 weeks. Its a very hard subject and we have major atrition every year but I think these students are staying. I'm used to taking a highly complicated course that takes college kids about 12 weeks and turning it into projects they can get through. Its hard, its really hard. We have only a few resources and I put a lot of money into it. All of the kids are very different. Some come from AP/Honors classes, home schooled students, and others are from schools where they can barely spell their name. I get computers donated or raise the money for them so we can have a lab. Most students don't have computers of their own so sometimes there is a lot of computer literacy that happens as well.

**TLDR: I volunteer and I have a student who acts like she is high but she isn't. The situation is getting worse and I want to find a way to get her excited and involved instead of her own little world. Any suggestions are appreciated.**

The first class was a train wreck.  The kids were all over the place, getting into my stuff (which I'd said was off limits), talking over each other and me, touching each other - typical for little kids I guess but impossible to get a word in edgewise.

So I decided to use some of the techniques I'd observed (read: been subjected to) in Marine Boot Camp.

I stacked the chairs in a front corner of the class, with the loudest kids next to me and the talkers separated from each other by the shy kids.

I've heard that the best way to keep any class engaged is to move quickly but in small increments.  To do that,' you shout ""OPEN!"" and open your ears and listen to me.""  We practiced this a few times: ""ears"" ""mumblemumble"" ""no, I said EARS"" ""earsmumble"" ""try it again - EARS!"" ""open"" ""again, EARS!"" ""OPEN!""  

Then I did the same thing but with ""EYEBALLS!"" ""CLICK!"" and they're supposed to look at me.  Always in that order: ears-open. eyeballs-click.  The rhythm of the syllables are important: one, one.  This helps the kids hear the difference between the two commands.  We worked on sitting down and standing up quickly, ""Ready.... sit! - DROP LIKE A ROCK!"" and they all come crashing down.  ""Ready.... stand! - UP!"" and we worked on this for a while.  The last thing I introduced was ""Hands - DOWN"" where they put their hands behind their backs.

In between each of these steps, then I'd have them walk back to their positions, then it would be EARS EYEBALLS READY SIT EARS EYEBALLS HANDS.  I'd then say, new instructions, and we'd work on the next thing.

It was incredible how easily it came to the kids and how much more control I had over the class.  The hours absolutely flew by last week and I was impressed by how quickly the kids were able to pick up on solfege, and learning very basic dance steps.

I think a big problem is that I am soft-spoken. I talk as loudly and firmly as I can, but I can hardly get the kids' attention.  Other adults walk in the room and my kids are immediately silent.  I use pretty much the same lesson plans as the other first grade teacher in the building, but that class is doing well. (The kids are on the same academic levels, they are evenly mixed based on test scores and teacher recommendation.)

I also hate that I have had hardly any free time in the past six weeks.  I'm there from at least 7:00am to 4:00pm, and planning.  I know it shouldn't take that long, but my attention span is very short, plus I spend a lot of time looking up/researching ways to teach concepts because my own ideas are boring. 

I know what to do.  I listen to other teachers and give them good advice.  I got great grades in college and my Praxis scores were nearly perfect. It's not that I'm clueless

As poorly behaved as my class is, more motivated teacher?  Or should I stick it out until the end of the year so they don't feel abandoned?  If I quit, I have to give 30 days notice so they can hire a replacement, but they still might go about 2 weeks without a teacher. 

I wanted to quit before I even started student teaching 3 and a half years ago.  My field experience supervisor told me that she thought teaching wasn't for me (she was kind of a bitch)

I'm located in the US, but it wasn't something I loved and it wasn't something I was particularly great at. By the start of my junior year, I was pretty unhappy. My volunteer teaching work at a local middle school and the Chinese language I was studying were the only things I was actually enjoying. 

After a lot of thought, in Mandarin. The way the program is set up, you take a year's worth of courses before you apply into the education part. I've finished all of those classes, and I have genuinely loved all it. It includes early observation in a foreign language classroom, and though they couldn't find a Chinese classroom for me to observe in, I'm enjoying the French class immensely. I really think this is something I want to do, even if it means graduating way late.

After these classes, no one ever made sure that there were *actually* school placements available for Chinese before they created and advertised the program.

I'm left feeling entirely adrift. I've met with a lot of administration, but I wouldn't have switched out of engineering for a cultural studies degree.  

I'm left really wondering where to go from here. I'm a senior in college without any idea. I've met with an adviser, expensive, and I've heard iffy things. 

If I want to teach Chinese, and I've always assumed you get a lot more out of a teaching masters after you've actually been teaching for a while. Is Teach for America an option, or something like it? I've heard mixed things there as well, in addition to them being very selective in who they accept. It doesn't sound like a safe bet.

Yes

Example: 

Disrupting the classroom during class wastes my time spent preparing for the lesson and draws focus away from the material.

Consequence - The student will submit a mini-lesson plan and teach either the review lesson for the material or another 10-15 minute lesson of my choosing.

Nothing will ever keep me from teaching, but this is one reason that is making me explore other age groups.  Lastly, I don't know if elementary education would satisfy me academically.

All of my friends and relatives that I've talked to have given me surprised looks before asking why I've chosen to work with kids over being a doctor, or engineer!

My piece of advice came from my tutor while I was training

Basically, but often, in one class you'll have pupils who have special needs, and resources need to be geared towards them to facilitate their learning. Similarly, you'll have pupils who have incredible abilities, and they need to be stretched. However, it's so easy to get caught up in making sure these two extremes are catered for, but I just mean those who neither need extra help with tuition

I saw a poem on a classroom wall once that I wish I'd written down. It was written from the perspective of a pupil just like that. The poem went on to describe their life in school and how they just plodded on through school and didn't have any great sense of self because they felt they weren't anything special

I called Sally's mom at the end of the day and let her know what was going on.  She said she would speak to Sally and let me know how the conversation went.  I just got an email from mom saying that Sally believes she had NO attitude problem whatsoever and that she did not act rudely.  Moreover

Mom was supportive and says she doesn't entirely believe Sally because she is a teenager and she asked that Sally and I have a conversation on Monday.  I'm not entirely sure how to approach the conversation because Sally acted very rudely to me and I did not trust her to walk to the office without an escort based on how she treated me in class.

The students were respectful and many were very helpful.  I didn't really have to actively teach any lessons, others read, some played scrabble, and others just talked or listened to music quietly.

To summarize, is a high poverty school that received a higher ranking than traditionally ""good"" school districts even though their raw ACT test scores were not as high.  Why?  These students showed more actual growth given their socioeconomic status.  Students in high SES districts start off their educational career with more knowledge (for example, more words are spoken to them so their vocabulary tends to be better) than those living in poverty.  Thus, Godwin students showed much more educational growth from their starting point than wealthier students because they had more hurdles to overcome.

Well, but don't feel confident in my abilities as a teacher. I have difficulty talking to people, making eye contact..etc and I generally just feel uncomfortable.

I feel like I don't come across as very self-confident - which is a detriment to interviewing and managing a classroom. 

For background info, but my certification is in secondary ed, which I have no experience in. I feel that I was successful in my previous jobs, and did things outside of what was required of me that make me proud, but its hard to focus on these small wins.

So I've had time to somewhat diagram an idea for a class which has probably been thought of before but thought I'd float it for some discussion or comments.

The idea is to individualize progression down ""paths"" within a course itself, as such, I've observed that some students excel at grammar, others at literature discussion, literature comprehension, and even poetry (I say even because poetry is slowly dying out of public education in many places). These different categories provide the basic structure.

For example: A student on the poetry track would begin with very simple examination of very simple poems. ""Fire and Ice"" by Robert Frost. In order to progress to the next level, the student would have to employ skills discussed in the ""formal lecture"" of the class as well as methods learned through individualized lessons with the teacher and others in that track. Successful completion of this tier would reward a corresponding treat, such as a day off or free drink/snack/other things students like to get. The tier for studying ""The Raven"" would award something like the poster of the poem in the shape of a raven or perhaps the t-shirt. (Putting cost aside for the theory) The variety of rewards and individualized instruction would allow for all students to progress at their own pace.

In addition to the individual progression, to ""1st chair"" the highest. The students would be assigned tasks to perform in front of the class with guest teachers as judges. Rewards for achieving ranks would be greater and ongoing such as being first in line for lunch, privileges in behavior, etc. In order to advance to the highest chairs, students would need to diversify their path progression, so that they invest time in each path while still focusing on their primary line. This would be primarily encouraging for self motivating students.

Obviously this would be designed for an accelerated class or an AP class, but actually the instant gratification of the early tiers. This starts acting as a temptation for the later levels which require significantly more work. The method of evaluation would be a one to one understanding demonstrated for the teacher which is hard to feign or momentarily master as opposed to a multiple choice test. Of course all of this would require a tremendous amount of work for the teacher, but I think it could properly engage many students at a level they have never experienced before.

I apologize if my description is erratic, pointing out gaping holes, etc.

Happy teaching.

I am an ed. tech

My mentor had to leave on Friday for a half day, and the room was silent as students were working on an independent quiz. As I was writing on the board, the student I mentioned above started moaning and complaining loudly that he didn't want/know what to write as answers on the quiz. Before I can act, another girl across the room called out for him to shut up and gave him the finger. He called out, ""yeah fuck you, too."" I gave them both detentions. Neither seemed very surprised.

The question:

Detentions are totally teacher-controlled. They will come to my mentor's room after school tomorrow, but also so that these students don't get the impression that they need to listen to my mentor more than to me or that I won't carry through with what I say in the classroom.

The education community has blindly accepted the idea that people have different learning styles. This idea is not supported by psychological research. Psychological research has not shown that there is any measurable difference among people of varied backgrounds or ethnic communities in the way that they learn. Howard Gardner's ideas have not been supported by research in psychology either.

The statement ""people of color have different learning styles than others"" is then a simply ignorant statement

The statement ""people of color learn better by doing"" is simply misleading because it implies that other students don't learn better this way. *All* students learn better by doing.

1346898639.0,zfg3u,Feeling disheartened and looking for advice,rubybooby,9,1,12,"I'm 9 months in to my first year of teaching high school (in Australia). I teach at a school that has a reputation in some ways for being ""rough"" - lots of challenging behaviours

I teach five classes and I would say that I have a reasonable to excellent rapport with three of them (two 7th grade classes and an 11th grade class). 

However

I feel like I am constantly being the ""bitch"" teacher to both of these classes. I find myself yelling at them far more often than I would like. Two days ago I completely lost it at my 8th grade class because a large group of them were being deliberately disruptive, deliberate disrespect. One of the main ringleaders in this class told my head teacher that he was deliberately targeting me because I was a small woman and he wanted to see if he could push me over the edge. I just find that so unbelievably nasty. 

I'm tired of being treated with disrespect. I'm tired of having students flatly refuse to follow instructions and then treat the ensuing consequence like it's nothing. I'm tired of having to get to the point of suspending a student before they will show any kind of change in behaviour, using the same strategies as I am. Why isn't it working for me? 

I try so hard every day to remain calm, but I can only take so much, and eventually I end up yelling and being the kind of teacher I always swore that I would never become. I find it hard to keep the tone of the lessons positive and conducive to learning when half the students in the room seem to be intent on disrupting the lesson, disrespecting me to my face and then having the nerve to laugh at me or tell me to fuck off or (insert unnecessarily rude statement here) when given a consequence for their poor behaviour. 

I took today off work because I just couldn't face another day of it this week. I've spent the whole day so far stressing about how tomorrow is going to go. How can I face that 8th grade class when the last time I saw them I damaged what little rapport I had managed to build by letting my frustration surface and yelling at them? And when  say yelling

Open each class with a word problem on the board that hits on some or all of the concepts laid out in the chapter for the day. Then maneuver a group discussion to solve the problem. By ""maneuver"", try to aim the discussion - by asking appropriate questions - towards the concepts of the chapter and outline them explicitly when they come up. Continue until the problem is solved. If some concepts did not come up or you have the extra time or it seems like most of the students didn't understand, you may need another problem to walk through. Have students take notes on key definitions and concepts (or possibly hand out a paper with the key defs and concepts). 

Follow that up with an independent homework sheet similar to the end of chapter questions in most textbooks (hits on each concept at varying levels of abstraction and application). Students work on this for the remainder of class (10-15 min) and can ask the teacher questions to clarify anything they might not understand. The teacher uses this time to help students who may typically have problems understanding the first go. Students complete at least 3-5 problems per section of the worksheet. Homework is handed in at the beginning of class the next day

Other factors:

* No book for the class

* If a student is particularly vocal and seems to know all the answers

* Students are encouraged to have a discussion

**TL;DR** Introduce concepts through class discussion solving word problems. Follow up with homework.

“I’m going on a trip and I am bringing ____. Who wants to come with me?” Each student takes a turn and says what they will bring on the trip. If the student brings a correct item

For example

Student 1 “I would like to bring a banana. Can I come on the trip?”

Teacher “No. Sorry. Not this time.”

Student 2 “I would like to bring come cherries. Can I come on the trip?”

Teacher “Yes, a heart and cherries.”

My belief is that it's a work ethic problem more than hating the teaching itself but saying that to her just results in a fight.

So I'm hoping anyone can help me come up with some decent advice for her other than to suck it up and stay the course. She has financed this ed degree via student loans and needs to start making money to pay them back. None of us in her family are wealthy so she needs to support herself.
