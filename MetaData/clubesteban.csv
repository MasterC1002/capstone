They all have like perfect characters in the game, its about connecting with their mood and when he at the same time has a weird looking character, it reflects on the people he interacts with IMO. Its like a clown in a circus joking with people, we all think it is okay because the clown looks funny.

I have done some interaction myself now for a almost a week and it is hard to find people to talk to. I wouldnt call it trolling
