The ""Bleu Man Group"" Burger
(Stuffed with bleu cheese)
5.95

* Get some hamburger meat.
* Throw it in a bowl.
* Throw in some Worcestershire Sauce.
* Throw in some Soy Sauce. Just a little bit.
* Throw in your favorite steak rub.
* Get your fingers in that cow flesh and massage
* (I also felt crazy and put in a little hot sauce and BBQ sauce)
* Make your patties.
* Cut them in half.
* Put a big clump of Bleu Cheese in the middle.
* Close that pattie up.
* Seal the deal by sentencing those patties to burn
* Cook for your desired length! (Rare like Rambo!)
* And enjoy! (Like you had a choice...)

1355882005.0,153280,How I decided to introduce some friends to Bob's Burgers,FacetiousBeard,41,1,7,"Not to long ago, introduce food related to activities on-screen (It may be what the characters are eating or drinking or that the foods relate to dialogue for example) as a way to further enjoy a film. A few days later, give everyone one of the 'Burgers of the day' from that episode. I thought people on here might be interested so I thought I'd show a few pictures of what I did.

There were only the five of us for the evening, picked from my favourites, and burgers, all of which were home-made, I picked;

1. S1E1 - Human Flesh. The accompanying burger was, a [minted lamb burger](http://imgur.com/vOSUf) (The top row) served with candy.

2. S2E2 - Bob Day Afternoon.

3. S2E4 - Burgerboss. The accompanying burger was [Papaya Was A Rolling Stone](http://imgur.com/dY6gm)

4. S3E6 - The Deepening. 

5. S3E2 - Full Bars. The accompanying burger was [The Jack-O-Lentil](http://imgur.com/b7WAj)

All of the burgers were really simple to make, let alone cut one properly). All of the burgers were served with store bought wedges and onion rings, and none were served with any cheese on them, and the buns were store bought too. Everyone enjoyed the burgers, even if one or two were not overly blown away by the show.

I am certain that I will do something like this again in the future,,False,self,t5_2s9k9,False,,True

What exactly is the appeal here? That bob despite his competence has a family that seems to hate him and side with the other guy who cheated them out of a minivan which his family really wanted? Suddenly Louise went from threats about anal rape with a banana to ""that's mean""?

The whole Bob is down on his luck idea is getting really long in the tooth and for some reason the shows writers have decided to just keep stretching that to even more implausibly stupid and depressing limits. It doesn't make the show good

That just makes me hate his family and hate him for being a wimp, yeah I get it, I also expected a good show but didn't get one, so I guess it's a bit too edgy for me. Bob doesn't have to win, but he also doesn't have to be completely and utterly brutalized at the end either.
