1372279083.0,1h4s3b,Dick and Don: An Adman and His Product in 60s America,HaveaManhattan,490,37,49,"   The original question on everyone's minds was Who is Don Draper?  Over the course of six seasons we have found out exactly who Don Draper is.  He's a cover identity for a war deserter, he's is the single greatest product Dick Whitman ever pitched.  Beyond that he's the single greatest product ever sold - The Postwar American Suburban Dream.

 Dick Whitman is the stone cold son of pimphood and whoredom.  He grew up in the clockwork mechanisms of the oldest business on earth, from a successful(so it would seem) man/rooster.  He's a little boy with an American dream, but with hard lessons learned. However he is no saint. When he steals Don Draper's dog tags it's obvious he's just as capable of human depravity as anyone else, even if it is justified to an extent.  After taking the name, he proceeds to start selling the brand of Draper as he himself is starting to buy into the creation and realization of a little boy's dream.  He pimps this image and the suburbs/office are the johns, buying into him and his family the way America bought into this Cold War dream.

 The Carousel ad (www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus) is glaring proof of the product he has molded.  We believe the ad because Dick's pitch is true.  But he's not pitching The Carousel, most of all to himself.  The pictures are the early 1960s presupposed American Dream.  That's why he believes so deeply. (Edit: Look also at how he approaches American Airlines' crash: www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-iWbrT-nvI  Dick Whitman - That life, that crash happened to somebody else.  Don Draper isn't about the past, he's about the future, he's going to the moon.)  Eventually, when the picture perfect family breaks (literally when they have 2.5 children), what does Dick do?  He casts another actress for the part. That's the type of woman Draper marries

Which brings us to Season 6, and there in the elevator, with a shrug, a torch is passed to the new generation.  As the season progresses, we see that Draper, the product, no longer has a function in this new America.  He is replaced at home by Henry.  In the office by Ted and Peggy. As the office's object of sexual desire by Peggy.  Even the mystery of Who is Don Draper went away as we wondered Who is Bob Benson, who also takes Dick's unsexual friendship with Joan away as well as Draper's Iceman ability to destroy Campbell.  And what is Dick doing through all this?  Trying to sell a product that is not there.  It's worth noting that in all his ads this year, just as how in real life the product
 
As a result Don the product is falling apart.  He's useless and hollowed out.  Dick needs to drink to be him, just like America.  When he is sober and slick haired Dick, he'll use a dead man for leverage.  He even tries one last reboot, moving to California like he's New Coke, and it falls apart just as fast.
 
Then Dick falls apart, to the most important customer  - himself.  He no longer believes his own pitch. The man who invented love to sell nylons can no longer sell a little boy's sweet dreams.  He sold Draper to himself the way we sold ourselves the American Dream and in that summer of '68 it all came crashing down like Dick. His confidence lost, the product gone, and then officially retired. The life of Draper the product is the rise and fall of that peculiar American Dream that came in the late 50s and lived and died through the 60s. An America, many would say, that never really existed but in our desires and product imagery.  And then Dick Whitman and his children go to work on the new American Dream for a new generation, 'because America isn't about the past...we're going to the moon'.  See you in '69.

In The Doorway, the usually movie-savvy Don has never heard of it. 

A Star Is Born is about a handsome, thanks to Norman's opportunities and mentoring. Esther tries to keep Norman's alcoholism from ruining his career, but he finds himself less and less relevant, until the only jobs he can get are jobs Esther can pull strings to get him. 

Eventually

The parallels are clear enough on their own, like Esther Blodgett""*.

Then when he went on to describe the ad of a depression era family (he mentions the family has [Dorothea Lange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lange) faces) sitting down to eat breakfast. The whole thing seemed so wholesome, cream, syrup, pancakes and then the addition of margarine just seems so jarring and out of place. If they were a dairy farm, as Ted suggests, with access to cream they would use butter, not margarine. They're kidding themselves to think that they could take something new and put it in the traditional thing's place without anyone noticing a difference. Just like how Don replaced Betty with Megan.

1370262538.0,1fks8p,Some perspective on metaphors and symbolism (spoilers),probablymattweiner,308,36,112,"1. Don Draper is dead.  He died in the Korean War.  Our friend Dick Whitman has been *masquerading* as a dead man.  This is what all of the death symbolism is alluding to in regards to Don.  Dick must now kill off the image of Don to emerge as his real self.

2. In the first episode Sylvia asks Don what he wants and he says ""to stop doing this."" He recognizes his infidelity to his wife as a weakness, he goes for it.  After he kisses her things get strange - the wife shows up, he is reminded that he is a dead person (Draper), and he apparently wanders into the pool out of self-loathing.  Don is a dead-man walking, quite literally, and he's trying to kill off Draper so Dick Whitman can emerge.  The entire show has been about this so I don't know why it is so mysterious for people to realize that what we're seeing is the mechanism of that death/rebirth.

3. There is no reason to believe Megan is dead or dying.  Here's how the narrative works:  Don realizes he is ""away"" from Megan right now, and we're watching.  The Sharon Tate imagery, violence, ambulances, etc, that surround Megan indicate that Megan is in this place that is marked by death, violence, they are taunting him and sucking him in like a magnet.  He'll go through the door by season's end

4. Draper's detachment from work.  Obviously Don doesn't care about work anymore.  Actually, giving up Chevy, and now, giving up his name on the wall of the business.  Remember that Don told Roger that ""when he leaves this place (Sterling Cooper), it won't be for more advertising.""

5. Mad Men is about how American society changed during the 1960's.  That's the entire arc of the show and it is what the show is ostensibly *about.*  The better you understand that era the better you understand this show.  One key theme revolves around the emergence of LA/California and the decline of NY.  We've seen NY become sleazier by the moment as LA represents the new hope.  People who *mattered* were leaving and things that one would expect to happen in the ""center of the world"" were now happening more frequently in California and NY was become less relevant

6. Dick Whitman's life is in California and the West/Pacific in general.  He lived comfortably when visiting Anna there.  He connected with Megan there.  Hawaii is part of this western new world.  Megan is an actress who is probably about to get fired from her cheesy soap opera.  I foresee Megan getting a new job in LA,False,,t5_2r7l7,False,,,t3_1fks8p

1372044588.0,1gy3oj,Who Really Died at the End of Mad Men Season 6!,Zenmoaka,313,57,144,"Don Draper. 

I know, or is it about Dick Whitman finally coming to terms with who he was as a person? 

This entire season encapsulated everything that was wrong with the Don Draper concept. Everything that he's built himself up to be has started to break

First, but Dick Whitman won out and decided to give Ted the shot at California. This could be seen as selfless, but it was an attempt to save the last part of Dick Whitman that was left. (P.S. That's the ""good man"" that Ted was talking about when he was pleading with Don/Dick)

Second, Dick did not want any part in selling some dream that didn't exist to some kid. 

Third, Megan, or even Rosen's wife; no, only the kids can truly accept Dick Whitman as a person in this fresh start. 

That is why I believe that all the allusion to death this season is towards Don Draper the concept. He can no longer survive on the fuel of liquor or random women (edit: or California)

edit: I'd like to refrain from painting Dick as a good guy and Don as the bad guy. Jesus made a good point in saying that it was a faulty equation. I think that Dick has more potential for good because it is a fresh start.

We see a series of crucial moments in Don's formative teen years, is the whore who was loving and maternal, but also took his virginity without his consent. She is also a literal mother, as evidenced by the picture of the baby in her room. I think this was a baby she gave away. Amy abandons Don over a dispute with the brothel owner about money. She is blonde and pretty with a (fake) beauty mark.

Stepmom (anyone know her real name?) is a maternal figure

Of course

So....my theory is that Don has never been in love

Betty was blonde, which is Don's major MO. But later she shows herself to be not a great mother (lashing out at Sally), and Don starts to see her as ""whorish"" (the bikini, etc). So that relationship dies and Betty abandons Don by asking for a divorce. 

Megan looks like his cruel stepmother but triggers Don's ""love"" when she acts beautifully maternal to his kids in the Disneyland episode. She looks just like a ""Maria von Trapp"" figure and he falls hard, just as he watched his stepmother have sex through the keyhole. Also, Megan is proving to be, in Don's eyes, a less than ideal mother. She abandoned his kids in this episode to go to a party (""casting couch"" as Betty says"") and her body even rejects his baby by miscarrying. I predict abandonment in the form of another divorce is coming soon. 

Sylvia is an even more intense trigger for Don than either Betty or Megan. She is VERY Madonna-like; Catholic, wearing silky kimonos and living in Don's building just like Amy lived in the brothel with Don. Mixed in there is the fact that she really seems to care for Don and ""gets"" him in a way that others don't. So when she comes to her senses and abandons him by ending the affair, the rejection is even more brutal to Don. I think it's the last straw. 

Dawn and Joan represent Unfamiliar Other and Familiar Other, unfamiliar kind of person to Don.  She flits in and out of his consciousness but does not trigger him in any way. Joan, notably redheaded instead of blonde or brunette, is an Other to Don but he totally understands her because a)she has been around a long time and b) they are a lot alike. In that gorgeous scene in the bar last season we learn that they never got together, even though they are the two most physically and sexually compatible people on earth by traditional standards. Don cares for Joan as a person and tries to do right by her, but she simply does not trigger him. 

So now, innocent, inexperienced. Sleeping with Pete, denying her pregnancy, and giving up a baby (just like Amy!). Growing in professional competence, increasing in physical attractiveness. She has both maternally loved and nurtured Don (i.e. ""The Suitcase"") and lashed out at him harshly in recent episodes. She abandoned him by quitting her job, but she came back with Chaough and Co. 

In the past two episodes Peggy has said some very important things; ""Move forward"" and something like --""I have dealt with loss. You have to let yourself feel it. You can't dull it down with drugs and sex."" Don has spent his entire life dealing with the loss/absence of maternal love by dulling it down with sex and alcohol. So does this mean that Peggy is, professional partnership or--gasp--his first experience with real love??? Or will Peggy's final rejection lead to Don's demise? I think this episode represents a major pivot towards the end of the series. Please join in and tell me what you think.

The sense I get from this show, Mad Men as a whole focuses more on providing an illustration of the often nihilistic absurdity of life.  The storylines seem to serve only as a tether which provide continuity as we experience these characters' choices and reactions.

""What is happiness?  It's the moment before you need more happiness.""  Don's comment, if not all, of the show's main characters.  This line seems to mirror the concept of the ""hedonic treadmill"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) - a theory which suggests that ""...as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.""  Of course, this phenomenon is applicable to more than just the accumulation of wealth, and explains why Don continually seeks new sexual conquests regardless of his marriages, why Roger acts so impulsively.

I believe that this concept is one of the most powerful themes running through this brilliantly written show.  Mad Men is not a soap opera, emerges a commentary on the choices we make in life, and our quest to wring the most happiness and satisfaction from it, viewed through the uniquely colorful perspectives of these various characters.

Don's eventual redemption isn't necessary, and compare familiar (and unfamiliar) situations with things we have experienced in our own lives.  We watch these people scratch and claw their way through life, making choices - opening doors - and in their consequences, in their flawed humanity, lies the art in Mad Men.  This show truly is not about the destination, it is about the journey.

""What are the events in life? It's like, 'Oh, what’s on the other side of the door?' Then you open a few doors and then you say, 'I think I want to go over a bridge this time. I’m tired of doors.' Finally you go through one of these things, and you come out the other side, and you realize that’s all there are: doors! And windows and bridges and gates. And they all open the same way. And they all close behind you. Look, life is supposed to be a path, and these things happen to you, and you’re just going in a straight line to you-know-where."" - Roger Sterling",t5_2r7l7

In Episode 6x10 he just told Bob Benson that he can't stop the voices and ""transmissions"" into his head that are telling him to do harm.  This isn't the first time he has made the claim of hearing voices or being sent messages.  He told Peggy last season that he gets transmissions from Mars directly into his brain.

Often times people with schizophrenia are incredibly creative.  We know this about Ginsberg

He lives with his father

What stood out to me in his statement was that he said the voices are telling him to do ""harm"".

This could mean a few things:

One

Two

Three, and the media, that make him feel like it is inevitable that all that all he ever does will cause harm.

When it comes to Mad Men and subtext

So what do we think we will see here?  We know mental health services have a long way to go even now

Will we see any intervention or medical help (or harm)?

(spoilers),beingjohnstamos,203,16,112,"Every time we've seen Pete in the office since the merger he's freaking out about some aspect of the business he's not involved with. This is mostly because he believes he's on the outside looking in at the new agency. Sometimes the paranoia is founded but from what we've seen so far there isn't some overt conspiracy to kick him out of SC&amp;P.

But Pete's paranoia plays into a larger part of his arch this season. Pete was introduced as a young account man with aspirations of climbing high in the agency. Well now he has what he wanted

So why is Pete Campbell freaking out? Because he has what he wanted but he never thought it would be like this. He never thought he would climb this far up the mountain to still have to fight the battles he's fighting. He mentally prepared himself for the job of a high level account man of the late 50's/early 60's only to realize it's a totally different job in 1968. Pete really is the only agency character that hasn't made some form of a change in line with the decade. Pete is still who he is when the decade began and he's trying to play catch-up. 

That's why the last moment of last night episode, to get with the times and realize he's working a job that is very different from the one he always thought he would have.    ",,False,,t5_2r7l7,False,,

On first viewing,5,2,4.

Once re-watching,2,3,1. How weird is that?

I will say that seasons 1 and 3 have the best *moments* which is probably I liked them so much initially. When you're re-watching, really wrapping your head around the narrative, picking out details in the cinematography, etc.

First off, Lucky Strike Pitch, etc. I know too much about Don now. When he rallies the troops for Jaguar or meets with Dow Chemical, he is still casting his spell, but a big part of that spell is the mystery - nobody really knows Don, and that turns out to be a key ingredient in what he does. Now that I know him so thoroughly, his ability to pitch me with feeling is inherently diminished. I'm not sure if this is intentional on Weiner's part, it is brilliant. 

Additionally, especially on first viewing, and still enjoy) such as adults-who-aren't-their-parents-slapping-kids, families-dumping-trash-indiscriminately-in-public-parks, kids-running-around-in-dry-cleaning-bags, people-getting-their-feet-mowed-off, blatant-office-sexism, oh-my-gosh-they're-all-smoking-and-drinking moments. The difference in the times is still there

Instead of wow-factor moments where I feel like Don is pitching both me and the client, and the critical inflection points of their existences. I don't view this a bad thing. Don can no longer pitch me, but his life now matters to me, and never did it feel more visceral than the season 3 finale. The narrative itself has become the appeal of Mad Men instead of just waiting for cool pitch moments. Think of the scenes in the Suitcase, or more recently scenes from Signal 30, Christmas Waltz, The Other Woman, and the Phantom. (Wow

I'm extremely hopeful for the near-future and conclusion of this television serial. It is absolutely a triumph on the part of Weiner and Co.,False,,t5_2r7l7,False,,,t3_14wa5o

1371563393.0,1gl0yf,[Spoilers 6x12] Was surprised to see nearly everyone came away with a different interpretation of the episode than I did (re: Don Draper),karthrowaway,149,20,104,"I hate questions on reddit that begin with ""Does anyone else...?"", does anyone else think Don Draper was *not* a total monster in the last episode?

Don is and will always be a bit of a douche bag, etc - but in regards to Ted and Peggy, I don't think he was entirely in the wrong. The client wasn't going to spring for the extra $25k, before or after the fact, and when the representative from St. Joseph's said they weren't pleased with the budget, Ted even fibs and says that he sent it over ahead of time in order to put everything on the table, because that was the right thing to do. Ted purposely kept Peggy in the dark about something due to his attachment. For a female character, because it's basically treating her as an emotional creature first and a professional person second.

Don did not just tell Ted what he was doing wrong, ""We've all been there."" Don might be jealous that Peggy has Ted (or that Ted has Peggy), but he's twice as jealous because he and Megan used to be flirty work couple and he was the one who became so focused on what he saw in Megan that he forgot to treat her like a person and an employee. I think a lot of his actions in the last episode stem from the fact that he really does see his old mistakes in Ted, and he wants to make Ted realize them instead of just telling him.

This is why he pulls the douchebag alpha move in the meeting, who might think the reason is ""The ad is really, really good."" (It's hard to read her reaction during that scene). Ted, who was worried that Peggy and his hands touching briefly and a quick smile during a presentation three months ago, is now so blatant in his emotional affair that Don Draper, who has spent the majority of the season ignoring everything except his own wants and needs, knows what is going on. 

I found myself in the same position a few weeks ago, because I like them. But I think in both situations, the likable character might be in the wrong.

* He basically runs the entire TV department- that he created. It seems based on some of the meetings they've had that TV commercials are a major source of billing. For example

* Calling Joan out as being like a prostitute was not cool. It is true that she is responsible for the logistics of the office and does a lot of work and has to put up with a lot of shit in order to maintain the respect she deserves. But thinking about it in terms of the business, who performs largely by himself what is undoubtedly an integral part of their business model, deserves the same level of recognition and compensation.

* A lot of their not liking him depends on their original image of him as a pushover nerd from season 1 (or something like that). I think he is right when he says they don't realize the extent to which they depend on him for that reason. 

All that being said

edit: I just wanna clarify something...saying that Joan did something disgraceful or unworthy to get on the board, then think of him groping male employees at the Christmas party, and then tell me that Joan is any more disgraceful than anyone else in that room. And let's not forget - Joan only knew about the offer because the board guys TOLD her about it. So I don't see how you can criticize her and not criticize every single person in that room ten times worse. So for Harry to single her out like that when he knows the kind of shit that everyone else gets up to, and that HE HIMSELF has participated in is fucking bullshit. When Joan does it is wrong and cheap, but when the men do it, boys will be boys.  That being said, he is doing good work besides that he is a dick about it.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1d0coa/in_defense_of_harry_crane_s3e3_spoilers/

**Limbo**: I believe that it is important to look at Limbo as being the closest non-believers can get to perfection. As you can guess, like the virtuous pagans, know there is something better out there. It also could be viewed that vacations are merely how we suspend our real lives. They may be fun, but they aren't of any substance, much like Limbo.

**Circle 2--Lust**: The next major example of one of the circles of Hell is when Betty confronts Henry's lust.  Of course

**Circle 3--Gluttony**: I believe this was expressed when Don overindulged and threw up at the funeral.

**Circle 4--Greed**: I actually thought this was well-written.  I believe this was shown when Roger's daughter takes his money instead of his sentimental gift.  It shows she doesn't really care for her family

**Circle 5--Anger**: This is probably the least solid one I found.  I think it was shown in Betty's dialogue with the ""commune"" teenager.  He, in return, almost steals the violin.

**Circle 6--Heresy**: I think this was shown when Roger was at therapy.  He refuses to acknowledge what the meaning of life is.  In fact

**Circle 7--Violence**: One of the methods of violence is the violence against oneself. This is where the forest of suicides takes place. This was expressed when Don tried to pitch the ad to the hotel people. Although Don didn't realize it

**Circle 8--Fraud**: This was another sketchy one, despite not even knowing her.  Even the fondue is covering one thing in something else!

**Circle 9--Betrayal**: This was the easiest and is what actually made me go back through and try to find the rest.  It was finally revealed at the end that Don started cheating on Megan. Not only that

Clearly something about it changes his mind and we see the season's arc-of-change really come into focus after that.  Yet most people seem unclear about what happened in that scene and it's critically important to what comes next:

Don is watching a *screen test* of his wife.  This is a reel of film designed to show an actor's ability.  She's going through her various poses, the sideways glance, the eyes turned down, the hair moved slowly behind the ear.  

Previous seasons have shown that Don really understands when he sees things on film.  It's a recurring theme going back to S1.  After watching Megan's screen test he cringes a little.  He's getting wise to her act.  And he sees that it worked on him.  It must be pretty good.  So yes

Megan is the reason that they landed the beans account in the first place via her coming up with the inspired pitch and knowing when to pull the trigger at dinner. This point is further reinforced in our minds in the last episode where she wins an award for the work that she did. 

When ketchup first comes to SCDP

The very opening scene of the next episode is in Pete's adulterers pad

The dalliance comes back to bite him in his face in a very public way with him losing both relationships. I think the metaphor is pretty clear

Betty is not a good mother, while Betty cannot. Her lack of options is making her miserable. 

She does not know how to make herself happy. She's even denying herself the ability to enjoy a mouthful of whipped cream (a scene that made me incredibly sad). Time and time again she is turning to the men in her life for fulfillment

* Death of Marilyn Monroe
* Assassination of JFK
* Shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby
* Chicago massacres
* Race riots

There's a ton more that I'm sure I've missed. Weiner is so subtle. 

Anyway

Season 5 (the latest season) took place in-canon between Memorial Day (May 30) 1966 and Spring 1967. 

This means that if Season 6 follows the same pattern, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.). 

So I think we'll get to see everyone's reaction to his death. It's going to be interesting. I thought we might see something like...we get everyone's reaction in the office

Any thoughts? Sorry for rambling.

Bert is mad at Don for not being around to run his department.  Peggy is mad at Don for putting all the workload on her.  Pete is mad at Don because he feels Don is judging him hypocritically.  But Don has let this all just roll off of him

But now Megan is not there, whom Don perceives as a threat, and toward Pete, who is clearly in the middle of some kind of breakdown that Don has been heretofore handling carefully.

And I was thinking about this

* Pete learned very early on that Don would destroy him if he stepped out of line, but there is still a part of him that yearns for a workplace where it feels like everyone is on the same side.

* Peggy has had periodic confrontations with Don about his imperious (""I'm the boss, especially since she stopped taking Don seriously when he married Megan.

* Megan was horrified by the office environment at SCDP - she perceives it as cynical and heartless.  It's the main reason she wanted out, is very symbolic of this new movement of the late 60s - young people, driven away from ""the system"" because of its aesthetic ugliness, seeking an elusive emotional satisfaction through unconventional activities.  SCDP is what it is partly because of Don's influence - and Megan is going to have to face this fact sooner or later.

* Ginsberg is something altogether new.  He is an energy that will not be contained.  Don's conversation with him in the last episode eerily recalled similar conversations with Pete (""I don't think about you at all"") and Peggy (""You should be thanking me"")

 Yes Betty is vain, rage or laugh.  Her mother has passed, her husband excludes her on every level. Society expects her to shut up and take it.  She would be relatively monotone and tragic.  She is the prom queen long after the music stopped.

I think the stiff upper lip that sometimes trembles is a perfect portrayal. January plays her with subtlety.  Occasionally I don't understand the choices she makes like the bar scene by herself or the thing with her riding friend. They seem more ugly than she has appeared so far.

Cute, and I think it might be possible that Matthew Weiner has a season-long arc that may be loosely built around Don's journey through Dante's hell.

Check out this Wikipedia article and pay special attention to the types of people and sins being punished in each circle. 

The first circle (that would be last week's episode), Pete in his hermetically sealed suburban union, and Betty in her political marriage. Peggy's situation is similar: she's in an *okay* relationship and has an *okay* job where she's *sort of* respected (or feared) by people she doesn't really like working with. Roger Sterling's therapy sessions made it clear that he views his entire existence as a sort of Limbo. Joan managed to get a partnership, but the cost was extremely high, and the payoff remains to be seen.

The Julius Caesar ""lend me your ears"" advertisement is another reference that made me perk up my ears

The second circle is Lust. From the wiki article:

&gt;Dante condemns these ""carnal malefactors"" for letting their appetites sway their reason. They are the first ones to be truly punished in Hell. These souls are blown back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm

Every single main character last night who received story focus was dealing with the effects of allowing their sexual appetites to override their moral compass or good judgment. Pete torpedoed his perfectly good arrangement with Trudie to satisfy his momentary lust for his neighbor's wife. The flashbacks to the whorehouse where Don spent his formative years floated through the action and shed light on yet another portion of Dick Whitman's views on relationships as transactions. Megan's ""miscarriage"" (abortion?) was a direct result of lust - lust led to the conception

It seems that he and Megan are a particularly bad match

If I'm even remotely on target with this theory

&gt;Is it really so impossible to imagine...that if someone took care of you, if his wellbeing was his only thought, is it impossible that you might begin to feel something for him? When there's true love, it doesn't matter who it is.

If this speech reminds me of anything at all

Now, are not behaviours unique to gay people. But I do think it's exacerbated by a setting as closeted as the 60s, where nobody can talk openly about sexuality anyway, making rejection more open to interpretation: does he really think we're degenerates, or is he pretending because he thinks I'm part of the social system that will judge him for not thinking that? Or, is he himself repressing his true feelings because he's internalised this homophobic world?

The speech, makes me think less that he's manipulative and more that he's just flawed and human and fallen for someone who can't feel the same.

And anyway, he's both gay *and* manipulative.",,False,,t5_2r7l7,False,,

[Spolier alert! Lots of thoughts on tonights ""Commissions and Fees"" episode.]

I've been reading in this subreddit a lot of discussion about how after marrying Megan

But tonight...I feel like we welcomed Don back and Roger stated this as well. Bert Cooper comes into Don's office and confronts Don about the check Lane forged. Futhermore,fires Lane like an adult should.  Of course we see the effects of this decision, which Don did not actually cause if you think about it. Here's why:

1. Lane stole the money
2. Lane has been struggling since he first appeared on the show to deal with his wife
3. Don has no control over what Lane tells or does not tell his wife about work or money. 
4. ...Lane's wife exacerbated the problem by presenting the Jaguar. Only further reminding Lane of the damage he's done. 
5. No one helped Lane hang himself. 
6. Lane Pryce was a weak character. He was a push over to become partner and a push over as a husband. He's the one who kept everything hidden and that makes him (ALMOST) in the same slimy ball catergory as Pete Campbell. 

So while I was reading the comment thread I read a lot of ""Fuck Don Draper!"" etcertera's and I think

This is Don pitching the Kodak Carousel.  Let's remember Don's description of nostalgia in thinking about his emotions in this last episode.

Now let's look at Joan.  Don's platonic friend, yet a woman who he is almost proud to see can take care of herself, even as a single mother.

BUT.  In this past episode, and furthermore, is a prostituted mother with a son at home.  When we saw Don's disgust and disappointment in Roger's office as he realized what Joan had done, and when we saw Don at least thinking he ""ended the discussion"" of the prostitution, and when we saw Don disgusted with Pete and visiting Joan's house to tell her ""it's not worth it"", were we seeing shadows of delicate, but potent nostalgia in the the creases of Don's concerned face?

Then of course the best of them all, he opens the elevator. The only thing along that path is rumbling abyss. It's almost like Megan has left and the world is inviting him to kill himself. That's how Don subconsciously interprets it I think. Or it's warning him that he should not try to follow her along the path she is going. That way lies death. 

Don has too much of his own identity wrapped up in this woman who wants be something other than his wife. He likes her independence but only insofar as it presents a surmountable challenge for him. He is not used to having a woman not be preoccupied with pleasing him(or hating him after she is done pleasing him). My prediction is that Megan is going to see some success as an actress despite Joan's catty predictions (she also predicted she would fail at copyright as she herself said). Don will have a very hard time processing this because as we have seen he thinks everything is about him (remember how the orange sherbet thing was supposed to embarass him? also the way he reacted to her sexy dance in the premiere). She will be somewhat famous and travel around the world and he will think she is cheating on him all the time. He might even be right on occasion given Megan's sense of independence. And then I think he will end up assaulting her or killing someone he thinks she's cheating with.

So I felt like this episode, but it details his first sexual encounter with the whore which mirrors Don's current need for warmth from Sylvia (both have moles on their right cheeks, similar hair). The speed he takes sends him on a collision course with his past and eventually allows him to see how it's making him function today, and the crash from the drug at the end is coupled by the danger he finds his children to have escaped from. Almost immediately in the next scene with in bed with Megan it seems like he's seeing his life clearly for the first time in a while, and almost immediately he moves on from needing Sylvia in the last elevator scene.
the line at the end of the episode quoted above worked for me really well. I thought it not only encapsulated the episode perfectly but, especially as it helped move on from Sylvia and take responsibility for the actions in his life (him telling Sally at the end that he left the door open and it was ""his fault"").

asides: 1) the opening of the episode was flawless and in terms of tone it immediately put you into the front seat of a new car late at night with drunk people all around you

Pete can be a prissy bitch, he's never been good enough for his father.
