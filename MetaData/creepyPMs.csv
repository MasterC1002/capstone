1375515197.0,1jm7v1,UPDATE: My girlfriend's secret admirer,Disgruntled_Fridge,1781,410,248,"Link to previous post: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/comments/1jk21e/my_girlfriends_secret_admirer/?sort=top)

So this morning I went and picked up my girlfriend from her school. I showed her the texts and they were pretty upsetting for her. I asked her if she wanted to talk to her parents about this and she said she didn't know. So then I told her what my plan was (/u/92llort_Retspih 's plan). She agreed with it. So a little while later I drove down to the police station (she couldn't come) and told the woman at the front desk what my problem was. 

She called someone and then told me to go see this guy a few doors down. I explained what had happened and showed him the texts. He filled out a form and then pretty much just told me that if he contacted me again, remembering the advice I'd been given, I asked him to give the creep a call from his phone and ask him to stop contacting us, to scare him off.

So he gave this creep a call and it went straight through to an automated voicemail. The cop left a short message that basically told the creep he had committed a criminal offence and if he texted me again the police would launch an investigation into the crimes. Satisfied

Later, scrawny and a little creepy. Apparently he'd hit on her like crazy when she first joined the class. I haven't seen the messages yet, but basically it went like this.

Jared: I was just messing around.

Gf: what?

Jared: those texts I sent to Disgruntled_Fridge. I was just kidding around

Gf: wtf Jared? You sent those fucking messages?

Jared: it was just a joke

Gf: fuck off. Those messages were messed up

Jared: I just saw you at (name of mall we frequent) and I followed you because i just wanted to see where you were going.

Gf: Fuck you.

etc.

This kid is such an idiot

I'm glad this wasn't actually a rapist (though I don't know what Jared's eventual goal was). 

My girlfriend has drama class in a couple of days

Thanks for all your help /r/creepyPMs . I'd probably have fucked this up without you guys.

###**This is unacceptable.**


I'm not even going to address the people who are doing it, through the submission page, and even considering a bot to message people who submit content here, to report messages they are getting as when you report PMs they go to the admins.

As for the rest of you, or you think it's harmless, please consider that there are multiple other people sending them messages that may not be harmless and yours is just adding to it.

We first heard about this a little while ago, and these accounts aren't just new throwaways of one person, they are multiple, year old or older accounts. 

**IF YOU ARE SUBJECT TO MESSAGES LIKE THIS**:

Please hit the report button


Consider that if people are treated like this, you probably wouldn't want to even try in the future. Suicide isn't funny, telling people to kill themselves isn't funny.

and to explain the entire ""wet rag"" thing: i was cleaning off some flavored syrup bottles with a wet rag. i was standing in front of one of the refrigerators (under-the-counter style) where we keep our milk/half-and-half. he went around and under me to try to get into the cabinet. my rag fell out of my hand and hit him on the face. this happened the same night as the texts started. 

....long story short

thanks for the advice and support :)


update: it sounds like they're not even going to talk to him about it. they're just going to ""watch him whenever he's around me.""....I'm not sure how i feel about this.

&gt;My name is Markus and I created POF/Plentyoffish. When I created POF, everyone started using the website via mobile phones. Today about 70% of POF use is via a mobile phone and unfortunately about 2% of men started to use POF as more of a hookup site mostly due the the casual nature of cell phone use.

&gt;In sticking with my vision that POF is all about Relationships

&gt;1. **Any first contact between users that contains sexual references will not be sent. Anyone who tries to get around this rule will be deleted without warning. This rule has actually been in effect since last month and it's made the site so much better.**

&gt;2. **You can only contact people +/- 14 years of your age. There is no reason for a 50 year old man to contact a 18 year old women. The majority of messages sent outside those age ranges are all about hookups. Anyone who tries to get around this rule will get deleted.**

&gt;3. **Intimate Encounters will go away in the next few months. There are 3.3 Million people who use the site every day,041 women, the ones with hot pictures are mostly men pretending to be women. Intimate Encounters on POF can be summed up as a bunch of horny men talking to a bunch of horny men pretending to be women.**

&gt;In short the vast majority of people will not be impacted. This is because the vast majority of people are not going around spamming women saying ""let's have sex tonight"". I can't change POF alone

&gt;Markus

----------------

This is a great change to make on their behalf. It reestablishes them as a dating site and not a hookup site. It makes it friendlier to women

We may still get one or two messages from there

Why?  I did a little bit of psychological profiling in graduate school.  Basically we were given messages and E-mails not unlike the ones on this subreddit and we were supposed to determine if the person writing them actually harmed their victims (in an effort to try to predict who's actually dangerous and who's full of shit).  Mostly, they did.  I'm not trained enough to determine if any of the creepers posted here would actually do anything, but the similarities I'm seeing between the messages posted here, and the ones we studied, are disconcerting.

I am certainly no expert, could have done to end the situation more quickly.  

**PLEASE NOTE

* First of all, don't go online to post in AskReddit, call the cops.  Don't feel like you're bothering them.  They can advise you on how to get a restraining order if needed, or just charge the person with harassment.  

* If you're under 18

* If you get a creepyPM

**Don't tell them that they're scaring you, they'll only feed on that attention.  One of the recent posters here told her harasser that she was suffering from mental health issues.  I'm sure all the creeper heard was ""jackpot"".

* Block **all** forms of communication.  Very

* If you have to see this person for whatever reason, but polite in your rejection.  And let that be your only attempt to contact them.

* If anyone threatens to kill themselves because of your rejection, because people who actually commit suicide don't tell people first.  More often than not, they just do it.  Secondly, and more importantly, it's a form of manipulation and emotional abuse.  Don't accept it.  It's not your responsibility to ""fix"" anyone, and don't let them convince you otherwise.

* Keep records of the harassment in case it needs to go to court.

This is a good, too.
