I'd like to take the time to do a general AMA properly at some point
However

I won't be as constantly available as i'd wish but i'll do my best to reply to questions over the next couple of days.

1367463949.0,1dj0y0,A list of the best advice I can give new dance music producers.,JacksonGlass,396,60,224,"1. *Read The Fucking Manual.*

Learning to produce is 95% learning how to get what's in your head into your DAW and out your speakers. I can write you the next #1 beatport song in my head right now. I could do five of them right now. So could you. What makes a great producer is someone who can take that idea from their head and get it into reality. That's more or less the only thing that matters. Read the manual to EVERY PRODUCT, ETC. YOU OWN. It's is the absolute quickest way to learn how to get what's in your head into the real world. SO READ THEM ALL. TWICE.

2. *Learn one thing well and branch out from there.*

Better to learn one synth

3. *If you don't know why you need it

No matter what it is: a note, a buildup, an entire song - if you don't know exactly why you need it, you don't need it. If it's ever a question of whether you should keep or delete something the answer is you should always delete it. (Or put it into a great big misc. folder and save it for some other project in the future. But not this one.)

4. *Sometimes you gotta delete great parts to make great songs.*

It sucks. You won't like doing it. It's painful. But it must be done and you will thank yourself later.

5. *Your volume fader is by far the most powerful mixing tool you have.*

Understand: every single effect in the history of music making is a manipulation of volume. Some are volume + time, etc. Distortion is the volume of certain harmonics. EQ is volume of certain frequencies. Compression is volume over time. That means if you were to make a venn diagram of effects, volume would be the big circle that everything else falls into. It is the most powerful mixing tool on the planet. Use it wisely. 75% of a mix is where you put your volume faders. Get those right first before you ever even think of touching EQ, compression, etc. Those are fine chisels, volume slider is your sledge hammer.

6. *Work intuitively

The first year or two you start you won't be able to do this. You'll have to think rationally, it's just muddying up the track. You won't have a rational way of putting this into words so ignore your formal training and go with your intuitive, gut feeling as often as you can.

7. *When in doubt

The problem with trying to make something sound 'good' is you inevitably fall into the trap of making music other people have already made - because you know they were successful doing it. If you have writers block or feel like forcing a little bit of creativity out of your fingertips try this exercise. Do a Save As... on your project

8. *Avoid calling it a 'song' for as long as possible.*

Same principle as above. If it's not a song - there's no pressure to make it sound 'good'. This is when you are at your most creative. Encourage yourself to PLAY

9. *You're doing it right when it doesn't feel like you wrote the song at all.*

The best feeling in the world is when you don't feel like you wrote the song at all - it feels more like a dusty book cover you found in your grandmothers attic and you're slowly wiping off the dust to reveal the title of the book. Like it was always there and you just discovered it. Seek out this feeling.

10. *There are a million ways to sound good.*

Mixes, some have zero low end, some have a warm soft middle and some are distorted and wildly in your face. They're all so incredibly different that it's important to learn early on there is NO RIGHT WAY to mix a song. Every mixer has their own style. Find yours by studying a wide variety of well mixed songs and putting your own stamp on the medium.

My apologies that I can't provide equivalents for all the non-ableton folks out there...Live is the only DAW i'm truly experienced with and being that this device is a native Ableton plug in, it's more about the concepts.  Simply put, This can't do anything that any other DAW can't do.

So why the Utility?  First of all, doesn't enhance or distort, it's just a device that handels the most important utilitarian functions that any producer will need to utilize in just about any track.

So what are these functions?  Your 2 way gain knob.  One of my biggest tips I learned some time ago was to do AS MUCH volume automation as possible on utility devices.  This leaves your channel volume free to adjust as you go

Secondly, the more mono, or centered, you want the sound.  As you move up the spectrum to the very highs, you want a more spread out, or stereo, sound.  Therefore, so when working with pads, even 10-20%.  At 100%, but to carve space out of the center so your big mono bass/kick/whatever have less to fight over for punch and presence in the mix.  Conversely

Finally, try reversing the phase of every sound in your project, if only to see the effect it can have on your sound.  On a very complex lead patch with my synths stacked and duplicated, it can totally destroy the sound, BUT, on a snare, or hats or percussive bits, get used to hearing the sound of phase reversals. 


So there you have it folks, it will help make your workflow and overall technique markedly superior.  Those of you in other DAWs, please chime in to let us know how to handle these very basic but very, VERY essential processes that can help take amateur mixes and get them to a pro sound.  

Edit: It's awesome how much discussion this has sparked.  Comments are rife with good tips! I hope this doesn't come off as spammy but I wanted to post my last track that just got released, all those things, can give your mix space and atmosphere.

Anyway

[Link to massive manual for further detail if needed.](http://www.ageofaudio.com/pdfs/Massive%20Manual%20English.pdf) Thanks sighsalot!

If you have any questions I will try to answer them below. Also

Cheers! - Stay tuned for part 2: Modulation and Noise Oscillators.

-------------------
**Introduction To Massive**

Massive is an interesting synth to work with. It can create a wide variety of sounds but what separates it from other subtractive synths is the fact it’s a wavetable synth and for this reason we can take a straight dive into the world of additive synthesis without having to dig quite deep into sound engineering and extremely complicated subjects. [Additive synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) is quite difficult to get a hang of. However

[How does this work? Well have a look at the oscillator tab under “OSC 1” and you will see “Squ-Sw 1” selected. Click that tab and a menu should popup.](http://i.imgur.com/DxI2PUY.png)

That menu is a list of wave samples. That’s right

*In Summary...*

* Massive is a wavetable virtual synthesizer.
* It uses a much more simple form of additive synthesis.
* It uses samples known as “wavetables” for oscillators and does not generate tones like normal subtractive synths.

---------------------
**Wt-Position**

[Those with more indepth knowledge of Massive will be familiar that a wavetable does not include just “one” sampled waveform

The WT-Position knob will allow you to select from a variety of waveforms included in the wavetable. These waveforms morph from a certain wave form to another waveform.

[Under the global tab, when a midi note is played, you can here a tone being played. Select ""Sin-Square"" from the wavetable menu. Now, move the “WT-Position” knob all the way to the left and you will hear a “softer” tone. That is a sine wave being played. But notice, if you move the “WT-Position” knob in to the right and play a note, you will here a note that sounds like a square wave. All wavetables that you can select all have two “basic” tones that morph into each other as you move the “WT-Position” knob.

[To get a visual idea check this site out.](http://quadrophone.com/massive-wavetable-images/)

The left picture represents the left basic waveform of the wavetable and the right picture represents the right basic waveform of the wavetable.

*In Summary...*

* A wavetable in massive can generate multiple waveforms.
* You can select a wavetable under the popdown menu.
* A wavetable in massive has two basic tones. The basic tones are the “WT-Position” scrolled all the way to the left and all the way to the right.
* You can morph between the two basic tones by moving the “WT-Position” knob.

-----------------------
**Intensity**

[Even the most advanced users of massive may not have any idea of what “intensity” represents in the massive synthesizer. We know it manipulates the oscillator’s tone somewhat. But what does it actually do?](http://i.imgur.com/tl1YxFs.png)

Let’s go back a bit to understand what is going on.

We know massive generates tones from wavetables. The Oscillator generates the selected waveform from your choice and then what? The sound is routed to the intensity knob. This is where the first manipulation of the sound happens.

*Selected Tone* -----&gt; *Intensity* -----&gt; …

What may come as a surprise to many advanced massive users (I didn't even know this) is the fact the manipulation of the intensity knob completely depends on the oscillator mode. [The oscillator mode? Yes, Bend +, Bend -/+, Bend - and Formant?”](http://i.imgur.com/Jb7uHZy.png) Yes, it’s that button you only had a slim clue how to use and now you will finally know.

Let’s start with the ***spectrum mode***. It’s the default mode for the oscillator. Spectrum mode basically works like a low-pass filter and reduces high frequency harmonics heard from the waveform.

Start with an “init-patch” and under spectrum mode: turn the knob to the left. What happens to the waveform? It’s softer sounding and has filtered the high frequencies. Turn the knob to the right fully and you’re back at your original waveform.

Simple isn't it?

Now

But I’m being too broad. So let’s look at an example to see how this works.

[Look at this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/3vZo8Up.png)

This is my waveform. I’m going to set the oscillator mode to Bend -/+ and set the intensity all the way to the left:

[Now look at my waveform.](http://i.imgur.com/2imcjHB.png)

It might be difficult to see at first what is actually going on. Let me explain. Massive is stretching and compressing my waveform. It’s compressing the beginning of the waveform and the end of the waveform while stretching the middle.

[Let’s move the intensity knob all the way to the right and have a look at the waveform again.](http://i.imgur.com/JBZUOBD.png)

This time Massive has done the opposite. It has completely compressed the middle of the waveform and stretched the ends of the waveform.

[Now let’s move the intensity knob back to the middle and have a look at our waveform again.](http://i.imgur.com/n8Oi5lg.png)

Familiar

Okay

Same thing. Really. [On bend - turning the intensity knob all the way to the left gives me the original. Turning the knob to the right gives me the thing as turning the Bend -/+ to the left.](http://i.imgur.com/5q84fXe.png) [On bend + turning the intensity all the way to the left gives me the same waveform and turning the knob all the way to the right gives me the same thing as turning Bend -/+ to the right.](http://i.imgur.com/QPbInUG.png) So what’s the point of ""Bend -"" and ""Bend +"" if I already have [bend -/+](http://i.imgur.com/Xlzmif6.png)? It just allows for greater precision.

[Confusing? Yes. But give me a break

That’s basically it for the bend mode. Now for ***The Formant*** mode. This mode manipulates additional transposition of the waveform formants. It’s an interesting effect I won’t go into too much detail with (you do have Google after all)… Think of it like this: If I play a tone in Massive and set the mode to “formant” I will be able to manipulate the transposition (think of the word “transpose”) with the intensity knob you can create vowel-like sounds (you know

If you want to see what this sounds like for yourself

*In Summary...*

* An oscillator’s mode is manipulated by the “intensity” knob.
* There are 3 different modes: Spectrum
* Spectrum mode acts like a low-pass filter.
* Bend mode compresses your waveform either at the ends (-) or at the middle (+) of a waveform.
* Formant mode changes the transpose of a sound (stable pitch) to create vowel-like sounds.

---------------------------
**[More of the Oscillator Section](http://i.imgur.com/o745bEt.png)**

**1. Amp**

If you haven’t noticed already

**2. Pitch**

The number associated with an oscillator is the pitch control of the oscillators sound. 0 is default and will play the same key you are playing on your midi keyboard. Adding 1+/- to the pitch control will play the octave ONE NOTE higher or lower. 12+/- is ONE OCTAVE higher or lower than the midi note you are playing. Anything .01 – .99 refers to changes ~~semi-tones~~ in cents.  (inb4 “WHAT?! THERE ARE TONES IN BETWEEN THE KEYBOARD NOTES?” “YES THEY ARE CALLED CENTS BRO.”)

**3. Oscillator On/Off**

See this button? That’s that just an on/off switch. It just turns on or off the oscillator.

**4. Mysterious Arrows?**

What do these do? They just scroll left or right between wavetables. It’s so you don’t actually have to open the menu each time.

**5. More Oscillators?**

Massive comes with 3 main oscillators labelled “OSC 1”

**6. F1 – F2 Slider**

This refers to the next stage of sound manipulation for the oscillator tones. They are then routed to both/or filter 1 and 2. Moving the slider fully to F1 routes the sound to Filter 1

* Brick

If you like your kicks to always be hitting -0db

* Medium

A happy compromise between flat and transient. Most of the examples above are Medium.

* Transient

Very little limiting, stereo dynamics and reverb.

* Soup of the day

I do what I think fits the track. Tube amps, 0 compression at all, violent EQing, whatever. I frequently go about my own less-commercial tracks in such a manner.

If you're interested, pm me a direct download link of a 16bit int or 32bit float .wav with -6db of headroom and no compression or limiting. Thanks!

* Another way to EQ subtractively is to EQ *additively* but then bring down the volume so that the peak on the EQ is at -0dB.

* If you're producing in your bedroom or a room with a bed or couch or similar furniture

* (In fl studio at least) you can get a cool distorted bassdrum (somewhat like [flying lotus's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfrXUvneS4E)) by using an 808 kick with a short tail and putting a compressor on the fx chain with a high (~4:1) ratio, 100 - 400ms decay reverb on that bad boy. It should sound pretty neat. Use non-bassdrum samples if you like. Just make sure that it doesn't sound horrible in mono or split the sound into two copies, one lowpassed at 250Hz and made mono and the other highpassed at 250Hz and as stereophonic as you desire.

* When trying to manipulate sounds (I like doing this with leads and vocals in particular)

* Side-chain 100% wet channels with a silent (i.e. plays through mixer but doesn't get sent to master channel) kick. Works well when played at double speed compared to the regular kick.

* If you happen to be the kind of deviant pervert that compresses the breathing space out of the master channel and you find yourself unable to hear individual sounds

* When you have quarter note hi hats playing constantly

* *(This is an important one! That I also learned on this forum somewhere &lt;3)* To find out what's too loud (forgetting about [fletcher-munson curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%E2%80%93Munson_curves))

* Reverse a sample, backwards reverb. Backwards delay sounds cool too.

* I *dare* you to reverse a sample with high melodic content (e.g. guitar or sax or voice)

* If you have multiple sounds on different channels with exact copies of an effect chain

1327037286.0,oohf1,10 tips for chord progressions from a jazz musician,parker_greene,231,16,68,"A lot of people have been asking for help with chord progressions and music theory. I'm a novice producer, and building chords. For all examples

**Tip #1.** If you're trying to come up with complicated and unique chord progressions

**Tip #2. Progressive &amp; regressive motion.** If you aren't very familiar with music theory, you're going up a perfect fourth (P4) or down a perfect fifth (P5), which is one of the most common chord motions. This type of motion is called ""progressive"", as it sounds like you're moving forward. A ""regressive"" motion is the opposite, i.e. I-V, or up a P5 or down a P4. Regressive motions sound like you're taking a step back from your ultimate harmonic goal. They are less stable and usually require you to go back in a progressive motion (think I-V-I cadence, the ending of countless classical pieces). Progressive and regressive motions do not have to be between I and V, progressive motions move up by P4 or down by P5

**Tip #3.** Progressive motions are a good way to make your way back to your home key. Say you're sitting on an A chord and you're trying to end up back at C. Simple -- go up by P4 or down by P5: A-D-G-C. Regressive motions are useful if you don't really want to leave the chord you're on

**Tip #4.** Moving by only fourths and fifths is boring, down a major second (C -&gt; Bb), and up a minor third (C -&gt; Eb).

**Tip #5. Tritone substitutions.** Remember all that stuff about progressive and regressive motions? Say you start at C, there's a shortcut that allows you to use much fewer chords while still maintaining a progressive motion. It’s called a ""tritone substitution"". Basically, you can substitute any chord in your progression with a chord that is a tritone away (tritone = 3 whole steps = half octave). It doesn't work well with all chords, so you have to use your ear to see if it sounds good, but it will almost always work with dominant chords (Major chords with flat 7ths). So now, ""progressive"" doesn't just mean up a P4 or down a P5, it also includes moving down by a half-step. As you will soon see, which is D

**Tip #6.** Tritone subs aren't just useful as shortcuts. They also sound cool in general because the ear tends to like half-step relationships. So instead of a I-V-I (C-G-C), but C-Db-C for your synth chords -- this works even better if you use Db7 instead of Db; remember tritone subs work best with dominant chords).

**Tip #7.** You may have noticed that thus far I have not mentioned any major/minor qualities. The reason is that the most important thing in a chord progression is logical root movements. Sometimes minor chords will sound better than major ones and vice versa, build chords using only the notes in that key. Some chords will end up minor, some will end up major, and some will end up diminished or augmented. Take the key of C major -- it has no sharps or flats (C-D-E-F-G-A-B). If you build a chord starting on the second note, you'll end up with D minor (D-F-A). If you build a chord starting on the fourth note, you'll end up with F major (F-A-C). Finally, if you build a chord starting on the seventh note, there's no law against going outside the key. If you don't like a chord that's coming out minor

**Tip #8. Jazzy chords.** If you're looking for that warm jazzy sound in your chord progression, and 5 of the scale -- to make them jazzy you just have to add extensions (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths). For most EDM purposes, I'd keep things simple and just stick with 7ths and 9ths. If you are using a major chord, you have two options for a 7th - either major 7th or a flat 7th. The major 7th is the note one half-step below the root, you get either C-E-G-B (Cmaj7) or C-E-G-Bb (C7). The former will sound more jazzy/lougey, you can use either the natural 9th for a more stable sound (C-E-G-Bb-D)

**Tip #9. Chord inversions.** So far I've built all chords from the root up. Generally you want to avoid that, I simply mean changing the order of the notes: C-E-G-Bb -&gt; E-G-Bb-C -&gt; G-Bb-C-E. In this example, I've taken the chord from its root position to the first inversion and to the second inversion. When inverting 3-note chords, you shouldn't have any problems. However, you may have problems when inverting chords with 4 or more notes. In my example, the first inversion was E-G-Bb-C. While it doesn't sound that bad, the fact that there is only one whole step between the top note and the next note down can be problematic. It's a good idea to have at least a step and a half (minor third) between the top two notes of the chord in order to avoid dissonance. In this case, I would just replace the root (C) with the 9th (D) -- remember, because it is likely already playing in the bass. If inversions make sense

**Tip #10. Practice good voice leading.** You could take a semester or two learning about proper voice leading… or you could just use common sense. Basically, those notes should be left alone. For the notes that have to change, you want them to move the smallest distance possible. In order to achieve this, you’ll have to try out different inversions and see which one minimizes the overall motion of individual notes. This is not always easy, but if you do it right, your progression will sound smooth and pleasant to the ear.

I hope this is useful for those of you who are struggling with chord progressions. If you have any questions

1342273490.0,wjri9,A crash course in music theory,syllabic,227,33,51,"Music Theory Basics

I see a lot of recommendations that people should ""learn music theory"" to improve their compositions
is an enigmatic and vague instruction that often leaves people with no idea of where to start or how to approach it.
I aim to help people who have little to no understanding of music theory get a grasp of the fundimentals.  Like anything else in life
music is built off of having solid fundimentals which will translate into spectacular things when chained together.  Art masterpieces
are made by using the same fundimental brush strokes and colors to create infinitely varied works.  To have a good
understanding of music theory you have to start with a basic understanding of it and work your way up.  

I have a background in guitar so my theory education is heavily biased towards guitar applicable techniques
but doing electronic music production I find myself using the same concepts of melody and chordal movement/resolution
that are found in all rock and guitar based music.  I am also going to be using some common nomenclature among musicians like roman numerals where appropriate
explain what you are playing (like saying I am playing in the key of F#) so that other people can play in the same key and sound good.


This post is REALLY long so I am going to put the bulk of the lesson in the comments.  Bear in mind that these are pretty deep concepts and it took me a long time to understand this.  If you don't get it at first

(This isn't for people just starting out, listen to the ones with very high ratings and good feedback from people in the comments).

This is for the producers that are at a point where they feel like they know their shit pretty well, then BOOM, WELCOME TO THE LOUDNESS WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You suddenly think:

'Well Fuck'

'Why can't I hear my track'

'How is their track so loud when my track also hits 0db just like theirs'

'I want my track as loud as theirs

Trust me, but this is why I'm writing this, to settle this for people to actually know how to make tracks loud.

Just to recap

1: Writing/Recording of the music

2: Mixdown

3: Mastering

Want to know where the 'loud' bit comes in? Its in number 2

Stop looking for the latest limiter 'wItH tHE BEsT lOUDneSs AlGorIThIMs'

Firstly, and its this which people always associate with loudness, which is understandable, but think what you're feeding through it. If you have a track with a vocal and loads of peaks (basically punchy loud things that look like spikes when you look at your track's waveform), if you feed that in to the limiter, what do you think its going to limit first? The quiet vocal or the fucking loud bad-ass punchy drums? You're right, its the drums. 

Now, so all's cool. But wait, now where are your drums? They've been limited so much they're now a big distorted squashy mess, losing all their punchy character and tone...well fuck.

So how can we manage to push a limiter hard without losing the punch in the drums?

The first thing the limiter recognized was the peaks, when you pull the limiter down, you have all that extra headroom which you saved from turning down the drums, so now you can push it harder without it distorting the drums as much, but wait...everything's good and loud but I can hardly hear the drums because I've turned them down...well fuck, now what?

Aha! Here we are! THIS is the secret! 

In order for you to hear the drums on top of the vocal, you'll find that most of it's punch is usually around 200hz, and its snap is around 2000hz, so now what you can do, is simply create a 2-3db cut in the vocal at these two places, so when the snare hits, these two important frequencies which make the snare heard in the song now have extra headroom, so now the snare is snapping through nicely AND its not being distorted any near as much on the limiter WOOOOOOOOOO.

You pretty much do this with EVERY sound. 

Using that snare and vocal example, either on a single band or multiband compressor.

Here's some info if you're new to sidechain compression (assuming you know what compression is

Sidechain compression: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prd-LtH9_DE

Basically what sidechain compression does is, every time the snare hits in your song, it will turn DOWN the volume of the vocal very quickly, just for the duration of the snare, so now you don't even need to cut the eq to make room for the snare, you can simply just turn down the vocal for the snare to be heard using a compressor!

Search for a multiband compressor called 5ORCERY, rather than the WHOLE vocal, meaning the snare will cut through, and you won't get a pump in the vocal, so its more transparent! 


This is simply the best way to achieve loudness, and you either sidechain or create eq cuts where needed. If you want to know which sounds in your song are peaking, simply play the song, watch the master volume fader and whenever it goes up really high, try and listen to what it actually causing it to peak, its most probably either a kick drum, snare or a powerful bassy sound. 

Obviously applying subtle comrpession on nearly every sound in your mix will help loudness too, but if something is using a lot of headroom, turn it down a little, and then cut/compress other sounds which are covering it up. 

You will then find that when you get to the mastering stage you can push the limiter harder

Edit: 

Just in case it gets buried

'Good read, if the next instrument raises the peak of the master, that one needs to be compressed or lowered to the previous. If everything is EQ'd correctly, there should be no increase in the 'peak', it just sounds louder because you've filled out more of the frequency spectrum.'

You obviously don't have to

[Not using this technique](http://soundcloud.com/official-flexx-artist/4flexx-intolerance-clip)

[Using this technique](http://soundcloud.com/official-flexx-artist/4flexx-forget)

I'm aware they're two different tracks but there's still a noticeable difference in terms of clarity and perceived loudness.

Edit: Sorry for swearing

Edit: I also stupidly forgot to mention which 'ZuluCompany' did, yet again another free plugin that even Noisia themselves use, its absolutely fantastic. As well as routing, it can give you an RMS readout as well, so you can actually check the RMS of your mix as an optional extra to help boost the loudness, but remember, if the RMS goes up but it doesn't sound any louder, but its still useful as it can let you know if a compressor is doing its job or not :).

this discussion is motivated by my curiosity. It seems to me that most of the focus of topics, revolve around **sound design** and the matter of what notes (composition) those sounds should play is neglected as it is of secondary importance.

Let me clarify. A simple example is the bar here at the right. Sample packs, you're probably provided with hundreds of links like ""Sidechaining in Ableton"", ""Skrillex-like bass in Logic""; those tutorials generally are like ""Ok, this is our pad chord progression, I won't tell you how I composed it: now let's spend the following 40 minutes giving it a dark ambient evolving sound"".

Personally

* Coming up with an interesting chord progression
* Catching melodies: how to evolve them from simple ideas starting from your harmony
* Got a melody? A simple guide to harmonize it
* Binding the bass to the drum and the harmony
* Escape the 3-note chords and add variety with these jazz-inspired chords
* Changing key: how to add a twist to your song by switching it
* Major or minor? An exploration of alternative keys
* Example drum beats in odd
* Counterpoint: Take your progressive house tune to the next level by adding a secondary lead that flirts with the main melody
* Classy tunes: orchestrate a string section to replace your synth pads
* Add variation to chords with interesting voicings

I'm making up faux-titles mimicking those found for the latest ""wobbling bass sound"" or ""beat repeater secrets"" tutorials. 

In the end

It seems to me strange that there are so few down-to-earth articles about composition for electronic music. I guess most of us know the basics of music theory (and it's full of ""what is a chord"" tutorials)

One outcome of this is that many critique requests by self proclaiming newbies are songs that sound good but are terribly unimaginative

I'm not talking about an obsession about ""that sound"", guitars and bass. The fact that electronic music puts you in control of the sound and right on the mixing console shouldn't mean that one can single hand skip the composition part and just try to ""make it sound great"" the most repetitive and overused loops one can find in a sample pack.

Maybe it's just my background as a classical music lover and progressive rock fan, but you can't throw out notes at random and come up with the tune of the year by accident!

In the end, this is the bass line, make it super fat"" and not ""Ok, this is a standard bass from the Ableton library, let's make it a super interesting walking bass line""?

I use FL Studio, but you'd be surprised at how good some of them are, and how useful some can be, no matter how good/bad they look. If it sounds good, it sounds good. It doesn't matter how much you went against the rules of music, if it fucking sounds good, IT SOUNDS GOOD. I use to compress tracks very subtly, but I'd think 'No I can't compress that much I should only compress a little because that's what I've read from these big people and they're right because they're successful'. Fuck it

Learn your DAW and every plugin it has, only get one if you TRULY need it or you'd either be wasting money or increasing your chances of getting caught for downloading illegal material. 

Knowing every plugin inside-out is far more effective than having a hard drive packed with plugins that you only know very little about. 

Break the rules, but every track is different, every sample is different, there are different guidelines for different genres so only stick to advice closely if it relates to your style/genre, if not, most definitely take it in and take what you can from it, but don't let it hold you back!

1374185659.0,1ila6b,Tips and tricks I've learned over the years to overcome writers block and just become a better producer overall.,smylesdavis,199,29,100,"I'd like to start out by saying **I am not a professional** by any means. These are just tips and tricks I've learned out of my 7 years of ~~producing~~ attempting to produce. 


**A little background about me**


I started producing about 7 years ago when I was in jr. high. My parents would never get me an instrument or get me lessons. Instead of letting that defeat my feeling that I was born to write music, here we go!


**1. Writers block**

At some point in our writing process, it can be anything. Sometimes your brain needs a break from having to process the so much of the same stuff. Just like your ears get fatigued after wearing monitors for hours, your brain gets fatigued as well.

Personally, but sometimes it's not that easy. Go to something else, come back with a clear head and you'd be surprised at what new ideas come to you.


**2. That dreaded ""not good enough"" feeling**


As producers we all get that ""this track sucks"" or ""this doesn't sound like *insert artist you admire*'s tracks at all"". After you've heard something **so much** you develop these feelings. 


Some things you really need to remember. The artists your wanting to have your tracks sounding like more than likely have been making music for a lot longer than you and at one point they were in your position. They also (more than likely) worked with professionals of some sort. Artists that do everything themselves and have ace sounding tracks probably put in countless hours of work and practice. You have to do the same. No one said it was gonna be easy. This is something you have to develop patience with and keep working at even when you're not happy with your sounds. 


It has actually been scientifically proven that we, a vast majority of people said they liked their ""opponents"" shirt better than the one they selected. Yes, you read that right, they had the option to pick between two shirts (that were secretly identical) and in the end said they liked the other one better after someone else picked it. 

I found this really inspirational because you need to think about your tracks like that. Remember how much you **loved** that track when you first started it. That's the feeling people are going to have when they hear it for the first time. How do you think AC/DC feels about ""Thunderstuck""? How do you think Daft Punk feels about ""One More Time""? They have heard/played that song so many fucking times they probably want to puke


**3. Experiment // Be original // Explore**


I understand this an EDM production sub, try making a hip hop beat sometime. Try making an ambient track. Try making a rock track. Push yourself. Test yourself. How good of a producer are you really? Find out for yourself and just experiment. No one said you have to release that stuff, but you may learn something new and it also helps with writers block.


I solely produced electronic pop/dance pop for the longest time. I just tried to mimic my favorite artists. While trying to mimic your favorite artists can be beneficial, or really a musician at that. I'm an artist. We're all artists. One day I might write music, another I may write a book. Another I might paint. Do whatever you want. Put a fuckin flanger on your clap and distortion on your vocal samples, whatever. 


This includes listening to a wide array of music. Don't just listen to dubstep or pop or rock. Listen to a huge mix of everything. Pay attention to the arrangement. Listen to the lyrics. Listen to the production techniques. 


**4. Practice


Do something musically **at least** an hour a day. Whether it be production, playing guitar, anything. It may not seem beneficial initially, but you are exposing your brain to an environment that needs to become natural. Production is just like everything else. The more you practice, the better you'll get.


Everyone does their own thing here. I personally sing over my own stuff. I make it a point to write new lyrics every day. Am I going to use everything I write? Realistically


**5. A POSITIVE ATTITUDE**


This is the most important thing I've found while in the studio (and in life). Be optimistic. Love the art you are creating. It is impossible to write a song that is universally well liked. Just because Producer Jack didn't like it


When your riding in the car, whatever, make it apparent to practice something musically. 



These are all just tips that I've found that have helped my production. They may have been stated here before

1348430359.0,10csf5,Synth Recipe 3: Progressive-House Pluck,mark-henry,182,17,46,"Today we’ll be making the joyous pluck from [""Japanese Schoolgirls"" by Suspect 44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i13-EY06-4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=213s). Give it a good listen. It’s quite versatile and it almost singlehandedly drives the buildup and release throughout this track.

[Here’s your MIDI file](http://www.mediafire.com/?ugihcnllqq1dt5c) for today. Open up a blank project in your favorite DAW and let’s get started.

**The Key**

A pluck is formed by a rich sound source that’s acted upon by [a low-pass filter with a characteristic envelope](http://i.imgur.com/IJsYH.png). Unison adds to the unique character of today’s pluck.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* A few oscillators

* A low-pass filter

This is the domain of Sylenth1, and Oatmeal (see [Recipe 2!](http://redd.it/109wrb)) will fall just short of the *full* effect, for reasons we’ll get into in a second.

**Get Cooking**

1. First, and tune the saw wave one octave higher than the square.

1. Now complete the basic pluck sound by setting up your LP filter and its envelope. [^[In ^Sylenth1]](http://i.imgur.com/G7w2g.png) [^[In ^Massive]](http://i.imgur.com/uSyoP.png)

2. Next stop is your unison controls. In terms of detuning, [they get synced up again](http://imgur.com/JI7U1), which reduces the thickness of the sound. This is where Oatmeal falls short, by the way. Its retriggering can’t be turned off, so the sound is stuck in kind-of-thin mode. Bummer, man. :(

That’s it for a basic pluck. Most of this stuff is just not too fancy.

**Dessert**

You’ve probably already gone crazy with automating the filter frequency and decay speed

This specific sound was made of one square and one saw an octave higher, turn this pluck into a thick and deep bass.

Feel like breaking the rules? Change up the pluck envelope. Twist the attack knob and get the wubby ""pluck"" from one of my favorite tracks

Why don't we, and at the end of the month we all post our high-quality self-recorded sample on to a post with the original raw wav. AND a processed version which was tweaked by yourself. That way, we can all help each other out as majority of us will be chipping in, AND we can all download each other's samples and increase the size of our libraries for free? I'm sure there could be a smoother way to do this but what do you think? Obviously we can do more than just one sample but I think one will be enough to start off, and then see how it goes, or maybe do this every week?

EDIT:
 
I've had a pretty good idea of how to approach this. I'm assuming most of you are producers right? And I also assume that majority of you have a Soundcloud account. If not I would highly recommend getting one

Right here is how it could work. We all upload our samples on to our soundcloud profile (in private mode), snare drum, vocal etc. This is good because we can then PREVIEW the sound before downloading it. We would enable download on the sample uploaded, and when put in private mode, we can put what soundcloud calls 'secret link' on to the post put up on here! All we have to do is basically comment on the post and say something like:

Kick Drum Sample
Format: wav 24Bit


[Private Link]

So if anyone is after a kick drum, they can download it from their soundcloud! AND, what's even better is we can check out everyone's work too and maybe follow each other and show some support! :D We should keep the sound up for probably a week and then delete it, so everyone has a week to download everyone's samples which should be enough, and it stops our soundcloud from getting cluttered with samples.

For people who will be making patches

Type: Patch
DAW: Reason
Plugin: Massive
Style: Plucky Bass/Pad/Lead Synth etc.... and then post on the same comment the download link which they too will keep up for roughly a week.

I am a synth programmer that almost exclusively does reverse engineering of sounds used on well-known tracks.  When I see a discussion about a particular sound veer off into the specific type of synth that was used, that information provides very little help.  

There are a few reasons why I believe this.  The first is that most sounds you hear on fully produced tracks are not the result of a single synth or a single track.  They consist of multiple tracks, perhaps with some tracks playing some notes and other tracks playing others to form a seamless sound.  

The best way to approach reverse engineering is to stop thinking about synths and start thinking about sound.  Jump sounds like Jump not because it was played on an Oberheim OB-X, random oscillator wave start points, and, if I remember right, a very light pitch envelope on the attack.  It also is panned left on the CD with wet reverb in the right channel, possibly the result of two tracks used without the benefit of quantizing. 

How do you recreate that sound if you can't spend $10

Saw waves

Layering some outside-the-box type of waves is something everyone should try when reverse engineering sounds.  A damn organ sample through a LPF might beef up a patch perfectly without anyone being able to tell it's an organ.

Adding randomness to the amount of detuning might add the slight phasing.  

The point is this:  synth programming is about how things sound

edit #2: trying to compile some of the production related (for the most part) answers. sorry the formatting sucks i did it quickly - 

**Q:** I know you have a major synth collection

**A:** Dave Smith Poly Evolver

**Q:** Is there any life lesson you would like to share with us?

**A:** never stop doing what you love. you could get locked up for 10 years and come out and still be successful at it if you love it enough and are good at it. (i didn't get locked up for 10 years just saying).

**Q:** Dat lead synth in the intro of ""The Way It Was"". How?

**A:** secret family recipe. ;) i won't tell you the synth, minor pitch bends in just the right places.

**Q:** How involved are you in the lighting and video production of your shows?

**A:** not at all. I already spend 100% of my time focusing on the music part. I don't have time to get involved with that stuff or it will take away from the music. I leave it to the guys who do that stuff best. Just do what you do best and let everybody else handle the rest. Hey that rhymed. 

**Q:** How to stand out from the crowd of EDM producers? How does one come about to achieve a unique sound that they can call their own?

**A:** that's the ultimate goal and the hardest thing for any artist to do. and i think every artist is in a constant battle with standing out and being unique. i don't have a definitive answer for this one

**Q:** Percussion loops in original productions - yay or nay?

**A:** it's not black and white. i usually only use loops that i've pre-made myself and only in the background to fill up space. but people do great things with a loop off a sample cd sometimes. there are no rules. i stopped having any moral opinion on the subject a while back. i just do my own thing which is start from scratch.

**Q:** Hi Wolfgang! huge fan! What is your favourite native instrument software?
I've recently purchased Komplete and am loving Massive and FM8!

**A:** guitar rig. 

**Q:** What inspired you to pursue electronic music? What sort of musical background do you have?

**A:** about 10 years of classical piano training is the background. what inspired me? hearing the music for the first time.
 
**Q:** Was there a time in your career you were ready to quit and give up? If you were to quit then, what advice can you offer to keep going cause I feel like giving up time to time? Thank you for taking the time and have a good day.

**A:** there were probably a hundred times where i was ready to quit pursuing it as a career

**Q:** What elements do you think are most important to take a mix/live set to the next level from just track A beatmatched with track B?
Specific Fx (freeze delay being very popular), tension-release in tracklisting, ect.

**A:** I think it's a really abstract concept and it can't be answered with a simple answer. A set should be an experience. You shouldn't just be thinking about A and B but think about A and Z. Also

**Q:** What advice do you have for kids who want to start doing what you're doing? Where's a good place to start? Where do you get your inspiration from?

**A:** a computer and some plugins these days.
inspiration is more valuable than gold. if i could buy it i would be blowing the bank. i have no idea where it comes from.

**Q:** What would you say the most important thing in getting your music out there is? What kinds of marketing

**A:** this is one of the most common questions i get. and i answer it the same way almost every time - stop thinking about how to get your music out there and just focus on making it better. there are A&amp;R's who go LOOKING FOR YOU (like mine for Kindergarten), even if you just throw it up on soundcloud. stop thinking about marketing and just think about music. We take the old school approach to A&amp;R'ing and go out into the world and find it, rather than waiting for it to come to us, and a lot of other labels do too. That's how you find the gold if you're a good talent scout. Because the demo in your inbox is in 30 other labels' inboxes too. 

**Q:** Would you mind briefly stating your workflow? I know it's different for each track but do you work on a melody first? Drums? 

**A:** drums usually.

**Q:** How do you make that really dissonant high sound in a lot of your tracks? You use it a lot in The Champ. I've tried to reproduce it but I can never even get close

**A:** you can do it with anything. just a lot of distortion. it's usually just one note but with the right distortion you can make it sound like real electric guitar feedback if you play the right interval over the bass note that you put it on top of.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* 1 saw wave
* Distortion (A plain soft clip like Ableton's Saturator or Fruity Soft Clip sounds closest to Jaytech's original)
* Spatialization (i.e. delay and reverb) to taste.

**The Key**

The essence of this sound is a saw wave passed through clipping distortion plus epic spatialization effects.

**Get Cooking**

1. This is a simple chain with only a few elements: generator &gt; distortion &gt; spatialization. Go ahead and get set that up

2. Get a raw saw wave running out of your synth. That's it, that was easy.

2. Now go back to your synth and turn on a low-pass (LP) filter. It's time to get artsy, by the way, are as follows: A, F# down to A, B, then A down to E, F#.

**Tweaks**

The brief moments when two notes are playing at once create an awesome shredding sound, it's pretty sweet.

This is a pretty simple setup

**Serve With Breakdown Sauce**

Hello, and if so, I'll keep making them! I'm also expecting to get lots of feedback in the comments that reveals where I wasn't clear or what else I should include.

-------------------

**Everything is sine waves.**

Any signal can be converted from a function of intensity over time, because the Fourier transform is a beautiful application of mathematics.  (Although, it's pretty involved, equations for it look like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/6/d/96d719730559f4399cf1ddc2ba973bbd.png).) 

The Fourier transform has many uses in math, electronics, image processing, and digital signal processing.  That last bit is what we do, as any DAW is at its core a DSP.  DAW's do not actually do a full Fourier Transform, but actually a [Discrete Fast Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fft) (""FFT"") that is actually possible to do with minimal latency, but you do not need to be concerned with this.  All you need to take away from this is the transformation from the ""time domain"" to the ""frequency domain"" --  from a sequence of intensities and times (think raw WAV data) to a group frequencies and phases (just a  bunch of sine waves

Why is this important?  Although sound is really just patterns of air pressure entering our ears

--------------------------------------------------

What are some properties of sine waves we should know about? 

At it's core, when you're dealing with triangles or circles, but in audio, it shows up because it is a solution to the [spring equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_equation), but the full explanation is 4th semester calculus.  All you need to know is that vibrating things make sine waves.  You may also have heard of the ""cosine"".  It is defined as the rate of change (or slope) of a sine function, but it is identical to a phase-shifted sine wave.

What happens when you add 2 sine waves that are the same frequency? Well, the waves cancel out and you get 0  -- Wolfram even makes that optimization in the graph.  This effect is known as ""phase cancellation"".

What about when you add 2 sine waves that are almost the same frequency?  You then get an effect known as ""beating"".  What you get is a single wave that is the average of the 2 frequencies, especially when dealing with bass.  If you play 2 adjacent bass notes, you will hear a bad ""WUBWUBWUB"" sound, and the final pitch won't be either of the pitches you want.  This is generally why you only play one bass note at a time.  In higher frequencies, the effect is less apparent.  This can actually add a nice effect -- chorus/unison plugins work by combining the original signal with slightly detuned versions, and all the various beat frequencies make everything sound more organic.

-----------------------------------

What is a [harmonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic)?  When something vibrates, it produces a wave that is inversely proportional to the length of the object.  This is the fundamental frequency.  However, it will also produce one that is half the length, and 1/3rd the length, and 1/4th the length, ... etc.  These are the *harmonics*.  How the object emphasizes these harmonics ajdusts the ""timbre"" of the object.

Since frequency is inversely proportional to length, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, ... *n*\*100 Hz, ... etc..  Added up, these waves will produce a coherent note  (again, say at 250 Hz, whereas signals with fewer harmonics

------------------------------------

What do the harmonics look like for some common waveforms?  A pure saw wave is a wave that has every single harmonic at equal energy.  (Since energy is proportional to the frequency, except every other harmonic is skipped.  [Graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+sin%28%282n-1%29\*t%29%2F%282n-1%29%2C+n+from+1+to+400%2C+plot+t+from+-10+to+10). Triangle waves are similar to square waves spectrally, except the energy of each harmonic falls off exponentially.  [Graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+%28sin%28%282n-1%29t%29%2F%28%282n-1%29^2%29%29+\*+%28-1%29^%28n-1%29%2C+n+from+1+to+400%2C+plot+t+from+-10+to+10).   These three common wave-forms are actually very closely related.  But it also shows how variations in the patterns of the harmonics adjust the timbre.  Noise is all frequencies added together -- no harmonics,  random phase. 

Graphing all these shapes by adding sine waves is essentially taking the inverse Fourier Transform -- so we can see how you can easily convert from the time domain to the frequency domain, that is the basis of [Additive Synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Synthesis_sawtooth.gif) -- it's how Harmor works.  Subtractive Synthesizers that work with waveforms are really just emulating the analog era -- saws, squares, and triangles are easy for hardware signal generators to make.

You may have noticed that the saw and square graphs had some ""fuzziness"" at the ""corners"" of the waveforms.  That's because there is a limit to what Wolfram Alpha can actually graph.  If it could graph the infinite series, and you need to ""de-click"" certain samples.  It's also why distortion adds harmonics.  There are a million methods to distort a signal, from bitcrushing, to clipping , to doing physical simulation of vacuum tubes.  The reason some guitar players kill for a tube amp is because vacuum tubes stop amplifying linearly as they reach their limit -- they very softly clip the signal, not really adding/boosting those high frequency harmonics much, giving a nice ""warm"" distortion sound.  Meanwhile, which clip the signal much more harshly

----------------------------------------

How do EQ's and filters work in light of this?  EQ's lower the amplitudes of the sine waves in certain frequency bands.  Most EQ's actually work by phase cancellation -- they mix the signal with itself, but with other mathematical techniques).  Filters just cut out certain frequency bands above or below the cutoff -- there will be a transitional band around the cutoff frequency as the amplitudes fall off.  The steepness of this fall-off is sometumes called the ""order"" or ""Q"" of the filter.

Thinking about the frequency domain also makes EQing in the mixing process make more sense.  You want to isolate the frequency bands of each element -- too many frequencies, or you get weird phase cancellation effects.  Your brain can't process those frequencies properly and figure out what's going on.  So if two things have overlapping frequency ranges and are making your mix messy, you either need to EQ to isolate, use sidechain compression to make one dominant over the other, or not have them play at the same time.

1355745988.0,14znuc,Very simple mixdown tip which will make a huge difference to how tight/punchy/loud your mix sounds!,,151,21,101,"Firstly I'd just like to give credit to the producer 'Culprate' for this little tip which he shared in an interview I read online and I'm sure many of you who are aware of him and his music will too be very aware of the quality of his work.

Tip: Put a low pass filter on the master bus when mixing, constantly keep bypassing this filter just to make sure everything is sounding tight and punchy down there and to see if any other sounds within your track need high-passing as some frequencies can cheekily creep up down there. If it sounds very soft and muddy you'll have a very breathy sounding track with no character (unless that's what you want), but ensuring that the kick and bass are sitting incredibly well together is crucial for a punchy tight sounding mix, just keep referring back to it when applying compression/eq/harmonic exciting etc, trust me it'll work wonders, as its very hard to hear if the kick and bass are working in harmony when you have all of the frequencies above smashing down your ears, which as we all know our ears are more sensitive to. If things sound a bit muddy, because it won't

Edit: Sometimes just changing the kick sample is all you need! Don't always feel the need to stick with what you originally started with, the people who will be listening to the track will have no idea how it SHOULD have sounded, only you know that, they will just receive it and be blown away with the great mix you did :). 

If you do this, there will be some frequencies from both sounds which will be the same, and when more than one of the same frequency is played together in the software it makes it louder, and the bass is one of the first things to distort when pushing the crap out of the limiter, so having a clean low end will stop this frequency over-lapping meaning there's more headroom to boost it on the master, if the track is aimed to be played either on the radio or in clubs of course where loudness unfortunately is desirable and sometimes needed. 

Edit: Just want to add that Noisia, and don't sit working on one song for the whole year, but remember that there's three very knowledgeable producers in a stupidly accurate studio(s) but that doesn't give them any excuse to make track after track, they still with all the tools and knowledge of music theory take their time so you should too. What I'm getting at is...CHILL. Don't think churning out track after track is going to get you noticed, obviously you will get that one incredible track out of every 20-30 but you're much better off just staying chilled, being patient and getting a song sounding as best as you can with the tools and knowledge you currently have. Noisia don't have some of the best sounding tracks for no reason, they're patient and simply enjoy sound designing, I've now slowed down loads and all the tracks I've been working on are sounding almost professional which I can't wait to put out

Right, compression. 

Just to clear things up, then compression will be your favorite tool. In this I'll be explaining why its used, not how it is used as there's many great tutorials out there on Youtube to show you but this is SO important to know to use what you learn in those tutorials efficiently! 



Lets Go! 

Most tutorials I see online are very good, and HOW it makes your stuff louder.

A compressor is simply an automatic volume knob. It keeps things under control. You know that incredibly loud family member or friend you have? How nice would it be to just have a volume knob for them and just turn them down so they're the same volume as everyone else, the compressor will do it.

So what we have found out is a compressor turns things DOWN. 

So ChewyMagnets

Let me tell you.

Imagine you're in a club which is stupidly loud and its giving you a headache. You have that friend next you who's trying to talk but all you do is nod your head and just say 'yes' constantly and do fake laughs because you have no fucking idea what they're saying and just hoping you don't make a twat out of yourself. Lets say you have that volume knob again for the person. If you turn that person up so you can hear them, making it even more unbearable. But imagine if you had a volume knob so you could turn everything else down, apart from your friend, that way you can hear your friend without having a huge headache! Suddenly the vibe of the club has gone, the music is as quiet as your nan's telly so you want the music up but you can't because then you can't hear your friend again. So instead of turning up the music, why don't you keep everything as it is now (level), and turn ALL of it up. That way, *and* you can now hear your friend as everything else was brought down earlier level with their voice!

This is how a compressor works, but this time the quieter stuff can now be heard as well as, what was previously the loud stuff. 

Here comes the technical shit

I'm now going to explain how compressors make your songs/sounds 'appear' louder. 

Right

The human ear is designed to hear frequencies in which we can produce with our voice which makes sense as what's the point in making ears for communication if you can't hear someone else? 

The average voice is around 100Hz - 4000Hz (probably wrong but its within that anyway). Our ears however can hear from around 20Hz (very low) all the way up to 20, we can hear subtle changes in audio around 100Hz - 4000Hz much more efficiently than we would around 17,000 Hz - 20,000Hz.

Another important thing to know about the human ear is it isn't perfect. If you have a snare drum that hits at 0db (as loud as it could possibly go) however its a really quick snappy snare that lasts around 50ms, but to the human ear (which is what we design our music to be heard by) the quieter yet longer snare will appear louder. The reason for this is because the human ear interestingly confuses loudness with long average volume.

*The higher the average volume of any audio

This is crucial to know. 

Ever wonder why your track that hits at 0db

Getting bored? So am I but fight through it

Right, and then turned up EVERYTHING afterwards, including his voice, you actually just made things more uncomfortable for yourself. Because not only are the loud things loud (the music), your friends voice and most probably everyone else's voices are at the same level as the music. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

YOU IDIOT

This is shit however this is actually what you're after in your music to make things loud.

Usually the things that are the loudest in your song (the things that make the volume fader go up and down more than Kim Kardashin) are usually the drums, guitars etc), and the extra headroom you've saved from turning them down you can now use to push the WHOLE THING UP. So now, the quieter sounds in your song have just been increased by the headroom you've saved by pushing down the peaks of the drums. 

Imagine you compressed the kick drum by 2db and the kick was originally hitting at 0db, when you now turn all of it up, the 'body' will now be sitting at -8db (louder) and the kicks will be hitting back at 0db again. Now your track will appear louder as you've just increased the average volume of the track, as its the 'body' of the track where the loudness actually is, because do you remember me saying human ears percieve long sounds as loud? Well all your long swooping/clashing sounds will be in the body and you've just lifted that up by 2db! 

The only down-side to this is you've just crushed the kick drum by 2db, because nothing has been crushed, or at least it has been crushed a lot less vigorously. 


So that's it, let me know but considering how well my last post went, I'd be happy to help everyone out because you've helped me a tonne! 

Thank you

1364692488.0,1bc0xb,FM Synthesis Techniques: Introduction and Harmonic Ratios,TemputFugis,145,25,34,"So you guys may have seen my post on Monday about wanting to start ""FM Theory"" tutorials so here is the first of several tutorials. I decided not to make a video since there were so many requests to do just text tutorials but down the road I will probably have text/video/audio tutorials especially for things like envelopes where seeing the shape and length is crucial to the sound.


I am intentionally keeping everything very basic and fundamental; this guide is designed so that anyone reading can apply the techniques to any FM synth so as a result I won't be going over anything too advanced (yet) and I'll only explain certain parts in detail when necessary.


If you're familiar with FM synthesis basics (what an operator/modulator/carrier is

So what exactly is Frequency Modulation Synthesis? It is defined as the change of timbre of a waveform by modulating that waveform with the frequency of another waveform. What does this mean exactly? Well I assume you know what an LFO is and I also assume you know what it sounds like. That's basically what FM synthesis is (you can actually make LFOs with oscillators in FM synths) except instead of using only Low Frequencies you're using much faster frequencies so the timbre is changed instead of just the parameters of a filter or volume control.


In FM there are 2 oscillators (sound generators) called a carrier and a modulator. A carrier carries the sound; it's just a basic oscillator that generates a waveform. A modulator is the oscillator which modulates the carrier. In certain FM synths however you have operators (Abletons operator, or both. I personally use FM8 so I apologize in advance if I'm not being as ""synth agnostic"" as possible but I will try to keep it so.

For those of you who are more visually inclined here a couple of examples. In [this](http://imgur.com/6W4YAkk) picture operator F is the carrier and operator E is the modulator. In [this](http://imgur.com/tcq1Ngu) picture operator F is a carrier and operator is E is a modulator *and* a carrier.

 Now that you're familiar with what FM is let's talk about how it works...

___________________________________________________________


If you take a look at [this](http://imgur.com/9EbrynJ) picture you will see a summarized view of the operators on the left and on the left you will see the FM Matrix. The FM matrix is where you'll be spending the most time as that is where you are ""FMing"" the operators.


I think the part most people have trouble with in FM is the ratios. I've seen people talk about only being able to make whale sounds

Basically a ratio is pitch. The higher the frequency, because of bessel functions, these ratios are linear. There's a certain amount of unpredictability in FM but with *harmonic* ratios you can learn what to expect.

If you take operator F and bring its ratio to 2 you will hear that it moves UP an octave because you doubled its frequency linearly. If you halve the ratio (.5) you will hear that it moves DOWN an octave because you halved its frequency. To keep going up by octaves you have to double the previous frequency to acheive the next octave so the next octave would be at 4, .25, .125 and so on. Since these ratios are harmonic to the original frequency (1) you can use any of these safely to create a harmonic sound. 

Knowing what to use when you want a certain sound has a lot to do with just straight experimentation

One thing I've tried but I'm not sure if it actually has any different effect (anyone with more knowledge could chime in) is starting with a ratio of .75 and then basing everything else off of that frequency but I usually just stick to 1.


As you can guess using lower ratios in the modulators is better for bassy sounds whereas higher sounds are good for plucks


Let's turn on another operator and turn it's ratio to .5. Frequency Modulate operator F with operator E. You will hear its sound deepen or kind of sound like it's ""opening up"" because you're adding lower frequencies to a higher ratio so they're kinda meeting in the middle. If you try the opposite
 sound. 

A lot can be done with just 2 operators with sin waves that have different ratios. Try turning on ALL operators and have ratios ranging from 4 to .125. Those ratios would be: 4, .5, .25, and .125.). Then just slowly start FMing different operators. One thing that took me a while to grasp is that the amplitude of modulation doesn't always have to be in high amounts. Sometimes I will only use amps of 25-35 just for making something stick out more by adding harmonics. This is especially useful if you run an operator through the filter and then have that operator modulate a sin wave with a low ratio.

The last point I want to talk about is using multiple modulators to effect a single carrier. This is where the post might get a little plugin ""unagnostic"" but the techniques are still applicable. In FM8 if you take an operator and turn it to a 10th formant with a ratio of .5 and have it FM an operator turned to a saw wave also tuned to a ratio of .5 and have the saw wave as the carrier you can create a nice Zedd style chainsaw bass. Then to add some meat back into the sound have an operator turned to a sin with a ratio of .5 and make it a carrier as well. Then FM the sin wave operator by the saw wave operator (which is being modulated by the 10th formant operator) just a touch to introduce the same kind of harmonics to the sin wave to give it some cohesion. The sound might be a little ""clicky"" or harsh but a lot of this has to do with the envelope and that is a separate tutorial in its own. Feel free to experiment with the envelopes and always remember to RTFM!

So that concludes this tutorial. If this stuff seemed a little too bland or easy it may because because using proper ratios is crucial to making harmonic sounds (i.e whale sounds, what you did or didn't like, and what you want to see in the next tutorial.

**Bassline Lesson - Level: Beginner**

First off: Assuming you just bought FL Studio with just their standard set of VSTs, I use it for most of my basses and that VST was the first one I learned what knob did what.

Now, octaves anyway). What makes up for the lack of playable notes is the rhythm you can use and the complexity of your bass. This includes any effects you put behind the bass. I'm going to get into that as well.

Here's my chord structure (this is one of my pad instruments): [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/yCbIU.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?q5qdjj5augvlnm5)

Now this is what my bassline plays: [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/4S64Q.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?yqarr24gcsuoq2h)

****

So we have the notes. It still sounds like crap. **It will.** The rest of the work you'll be putting into this is the actual synth sound and the effects it has. Having a good one without the other will make it sound like crap and it will then ruin your song. Many producers will agree with me that once you get your bassline and kick down

Since I mentioned V-Station, but that's how you'll learn. Plain and simple.** And once you learn how to use one VST, learning another is a piece of cake. Use presets as a guide as to how you should start to make a certain kind of sound but if that's hurting your exploration then you should ditch presets altogether. Nothing will be more satisfying than using sounds you've created from scratch and for it all to *sound good in the end*.

[Picture of my bassline VST](http://i.imgur.com/Cmxqw.jpg)

Now we're onto effects. In my recent projects I use the Param EQ2 and ""The Glue."" The Glue is a great compressor that's used by many professional producers. I suggest you pick that up as well. [Picture of my FX](http://i.imgur.com/mtyJr.jpg)

The other effect I'm using is another Param EQ2

What am I doing with it and how do you use it? Right click on that knob I pointed out (next to the green light). Select the ""Create an Automation Clip"" option. Now you can see it in your playlist and then you can right click in there to create ""dots"" and move them around to whatever you'd like.

1350925532.0,11wj83,Production Pro-tips thread,dirkwork,134,22,75,"*Let's list our favorite pro-tips.  This is what has helped me the most.*

**For Ableton:**

* Use the Utility effect for volume automation instead of automating the main volume knob.  This lets you change the volume of the entire instrument without fussing with the automation points.

* Save all VST instruments in an Instrument Rack and organize them by sound

* Learn how to utilize 128s (Sampler with 128 samples loaded to scroll through).  This is super helpful when picking the ""right"" kick or snare or whatever.

* Set up effect racks for commonly used effects

* Set up a default template so you don't have to waste time setting up effects/tracks/sends/returns that you use frequently.

* Use the spectrum analyzer to visualize the eq on all your tracks.

**General Tips**

* Break your workflow into 2 session types: Daytime and Nighttime sessions.  Daytime sessions are when you have all day to write a song.  Nighttime sessions are for preparing your instruments, watching tutorials, organizing your library, etc.  Don't mix up the goals of either session.  I generally have more nighttime sessions than daytime sessions, but when I sit down to write a track, I have a library of instruments, loops

* Set 5 minute limits to decide whether a particular instrument works in your track.  Don't waste time trying to make something work if it doesn't work naturally.

* Learn eq theory

* Don't hesitate

* FINISH SONGS.  Even if they will suck, etc, but you will slowly get better and being focused on creating a finished product will force you to practice the aspects that need improvement.

* Show respect to everyone you learn from.  Thanks to ill.Gates, Mr. Bill, Dubspot, Sonic Academy, Tornado Twins, ableton tutorials, and everyone putting out quality content that teaches people to create.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/11wj83/production_protips_thread/

1355259643.0,14onah,Synth Recipe 7: Dark Reese,mark-henry,120,9,44,"Today we’ll be making [the dark reese from “So High” by Shadow Child](http://youtu.be/OAdTtzqASJU?t=1m54s)

**The Key**

Reese basses are made from a battery of saw waves with an exaggerated detune. This particular reese gets its special deep dark quality from the effects chain that follows.

**Ingredients**

* One reese bass. This is a bunch of saw waves

* One vintage tube amp saturator. If you don’t have one yet

* Two lowpass filters.

**Get Cooking**

1. Get your reese going. Crank up the voices count and put lots of detune on. Things should get greasy and buzzy. Now turn on a low pass filter. When you dial it in right

2. Put on the tube amp effect and turn all the low-frequency knobs to the right and turn on all the vintage tube amp bells and whistles. Seriously

3. That saturation will have restored a lot of brightness to the sound, so turn the volume down.) Shadow Child didn’t want an over-the-top reese; he chose to keep things contained and dark and window-rattlingly bassy. An interesting choice that makes the track distinctive.

**Finish Up**

Finally, and the tube amp controls.

Also, sound [at 2:58](http://youtu.be/OAdTtzqASJU?t=2m58s). This is an excellent way to progress the sound. Another (more obvious) way would be to automate the filter cutoffs, making the sound swell brighter or fade away.

**Serves One Soundsystem**

Any questions? Please share what you made from this recipe in the comments. What sound would you like to hear in upcoming episodes?

After talking in IRC for awhile we came up with an idea for a brand new competition which I think you'll all enjoy. This competition will be a fun way to get producers to finish songs and to get you guys out of your comfort zones.


  **THE COMPETITION**

  Your task is to complete a song in a predetermined genre of electronic music. The song can be whatever length you choose and you can use any synthesizers, instead of assigning already established genres of EDM, you will be required to create a song in an imaginary genre created for the purpose of this competition.You will be given a few basic characteristics of the genre, and from there everything else is up to you. Here are two examples of such genres:

**THESE ARE EXAMPLES. THESE ARE NOT THE GENRES YOU WILL BE MAKING.**
  
  Genre: Flexatone Hardcore BPM: 140-150

  Time Signature: 4/4
  
  Characteristics: Flexatone Hardcore is known for its use of reverse sidechain compression and harsh gliding melodies.
  
  Genre: Neo-Pulver

  BPM: 155

  Time Signature: 3/4

  Instrumentation: Heavy sampling of country music

  Characteristics: 1/4 time drums

  **^^^ THESE ARE EXAMPLES. THESE ARE NOT THE GENRES YOU WILL BE MAKING.^^^**

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
  
  The competition will run for two weeks. Upload your finished song to soundcloud as a private track and send the secret link in a PM to [me](http://reddit.com/user/Doomsaloto) or [DinosaurHospital](http://reddit.com/user/DinosaurHospital). A voting thread will be posted with the entries. 


 ***THIS WEEK'S GENRE***

  **Name: Nu-Melowfe**

  **BPM: 150 - 165**

  **Time Signature: Commonly 4/4

  **Characteristics: Known for its erratic pitched percussion

 * Master Channel volume automation. Usually it should always stay untouched at 0dB. But if you put it down to -1 and raise it to 0 during the drop/chorus/loud part

 * ~~BPM automation. Basically the same. someone on here said that it's a usual trick in pop and rock. speeding up the chorus a bit adds some drive

 * Also: If you're doing dubstep, but the verses etc. have lots of little sparks and a very wide and full sound compared to that) Do some good buildups and some parts can sound heavier than they are. (Scary monsters probably isn't the best example for that, but I also noticed this in some other tracks I don't remember right now. Some choruses/drops are actually weak if you'd listen to them seperated from the rest, but they sound badass with the right buildup). Not only with dubstep but as a generall rule: listen to all your song-parts in context!

 * subtle pitch rises to build up a certain part. Without being too audible(they're not the main synth/melody during that part, going up an octave chromatically. Plus some filter and panning automations to make it more interesting.

1348965674.0,10oviy,Synth Recipe 4: Orchestral Trance Pad,mark-henry,108,5,46,"Synth Recipes

Today we’ll be making [the symphonic pad from Above &amp; Beyond’s *Buzz*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZpx5GiQb4w&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=91s). Epic supersaw pads are the bread and butter of trance, from Tri-State to Volume 9.

MIDI: [High](http://www.mediafire.com/?43k5zdu3psgo9ix)

**The Key**

It seems that the last few episodes have very unison-themed. This one is no exception. The one key to a thick and rich pad sound is massive polyphony.

A large modern orchestra has about 70 string instruments of varying types. To be as classy as an orchestra

Adding to the unique character of today’s pad is the fact that it is made of a few layered parts

**Ingredients**

For this three-layer cake

* Three instances of your favorite synth. (I recommend Sylenth1 today. Diva, it turned out all at once brighter, livelier, more metallic and more synthetic. So that was cool too, I guess)

* Some white noise and a filter.

* Two EQs. These will be used to layer the three synths together into a single sound.

* Reverb. This usually goes under the “extras” section, saturating the sound with spectral content and stereo separation.

**Get Cooking**

1. Set up three tracks, and one Low. Put the appropriate MIDI file on each one if you want. The MIDI is a transcription of the breakdown and then the main loop of “Buzz” the first 16 bars are the breakdown and the last 8 bars are the main loop.

2. Let’s set up the Mid track first

3. Tack on the EQ to the Mid track. High-pass at 300 Hz to take the body out. Now put a deep high shelf cut at 650 Hz. A deep cut; you may have to double up filters to do the job. [^[In ^Ableton]](http://imgur.com/3hGJG.png) A shelf cut

4. Mids sound good? The High pad is the Mids, each an octave higher than the next. Max out the unison voices and dial in the detuning to something tasteful; the High pad should sound less buzzy than the Mid. Now add a white noise oscillator to the synth, high-pass it to 10 KHz and turn the volume down until it blends in with the rest of the sound. [^[In ^Ableton]](http://i.imgur.com/QfD5e.png)
 
4. Now for the Low pad. This is less of a huge pad and more of a single cello line that carries the pad’s bass. Set up a single saw wave at -1 octave with a half-dozen voices of unison and a very subtle gentle HP to lighten it up just a tad.

5. Slap your reverb effect onto a send track and add even more space to the sound.

**Garnish**

Sidechain this pad to the kick drum. Aww yeah

You’ll notice that the original sound has a moment right before the drop where the pitch bends up up up and then comes back down again. To imitate this

Feel like it’s time to break away from the Buzz imitation? Sweep a low-pass filters over the mix to build up the energy. Sweep a high-pass to prepare for the drop. Try different waveform combinations. Break with with all this unison nonsense and try fewer oscillators for that thinner synthier vintage sound. Distortion. Et cetera.

**Serves One Stadium**

Any questions? What sound would you like to hear in upcoming episodes?

&gt;Well, delay, and compression). Afterwards, I applied different filters on both channels, separately automated. So I could actually filter down (low pass with resonance) the original lead after it's being sent to the effects bus, which means you can hear that the original lead is filtered down while its own effects are non-filtered loud and clear.

Assuming you have a sub channel, if you have 4dB of maximization on the master limiter, reduce the gain of your sub going into the master by about 4dB (use your ears to get it right).

Since limiting a sine wave just reduces its gain (while potentially adding distortion and artifacts), and make it easier for you to achieve a louder track with a balanced sub.

Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.

**Being a music producer and being a musical artist are two separate things.** People who produce their own music are a combination of both. Sonny Moore was an excellent guitarist and spent a few years in a punk band called From First To Last before he started learning the technology to make electronic music and became Skrillex. What I'm getting at is, and inspired.

To those of you who do have musical backgrounds this may be obvious, and are frustrated that the music they're pumping out still just isn't interesting, when they aren't even changing chords, or they're only using 2 or 3 notes in the melody. These guys are excellent producers, but have not spent much time building up creative ability.

While I've only been making music on the computer for 8 months, writing songs and coming up with my own riffs without a computer. I also played trumpet in my school band for 2 years. And the practice and talent that I had built up doing that just naturally transferred to my edm production. Once I learned my way around the piano keys, I was simply using musical talent I started building up long ago. These past 8 months have almost exclusively been spent been learning how to properly use EQ and compression, learning my way around Ableton live, and general mixdown and mastering stuff.

This is not to say that you need a musical background to make ""successful"" music: There is a lot of music out there that does not have very good melodic content but still gets popular because the sound is trendy... Try scrolling down the beatport charts for dubstep... But If you look at the tops of the charts on itunes and beatport and etc. you will find they are dominated by artists that really push the genre forward and make true, etc) and you can tell that they have musical talent and artistic ability by just listening to their music.

So, but just jamming out? How much experience do you have playing an instrument and getting to know pure, raw music outside of technology and the distractions that come with it?

Sure, or arpeggiate it, or even use an audio effect like pitch correction, it's not cheating... but you are cheating yourself. You will not be making your own musical statement or telling a musical story.

*Music is a language

While those techniques can be good starting points if you don't know any music theory

So, how to recognize the intervals and properly use each scale degree within the scale. This will not teach you how to make awesome melodies, but it will teach you how *not* to sound *wrong*. Then, once you start jamming out and experimenting, you will naturally gain a feel for it and a good musical ear. Lay down at least 8 bars of a fat beat, a simple bass line or chord progression, loop it, tempo, really move to it, you have a bangin' section of your song.

If you want to spice up your songs even more, and your brain is all you need to practice music anywhere, anytime. Driving, walking, running, lucid dreaming, bungee jumping... You can be making phat beats and riffs in your head with your brain.

After seeing a not-to-be-named company charging cash money for 'analog modeled' Ableton Live racks that frankly sound like complete shit

The rack combines Ableton's Compressor and Dynamic Tube, Attack (1ms to 60ms) and Release (10ms to 200ms). The attack and release of the Dynamic Tube are tuned to that of the Compressor, giving it a pretty smooth quality even at higher gain settings.

Sounds pretty great on your drum buss and hopefully will be a good example for how to create useful

We've been here since Jan 19

Wow. Over a year. Doesn't seem that long. Since its inception,000. I have personally seen a bunch of people casually getting the word out about this place to other people in comment threads elsewhere on Reddit. This is phenomenal, and always puts a smile on my face.

13 months ago, and evolved into a community of which I am proud. I've made friends on our IRC channel (you should check it out, it's a lot of fun), and learned a LOT about production and other completely unrelated disciplines from talking with the people here. Just as an aside, our mods are _awesome_. I could not be any more proud of them.

Importantly, we've gained a new perspective on an acceptable code of conduct. A larger community than anticipated has shown us errors in some of our previous standards. It's time we've made official adjustments to the EDMP Etiquette. Some of these have carried over from the last version.

---

**Updated EDMP Etiquette** 

Yes this is a bit long

First

* We've been getting a fair number of incorrect spam filters lately. When messaging the moderators about this

* The flair bot is a python script written by one of our mods rxi. It is a program that is always running on my own PC. If my internet is interrupted for even a moment, the thing checks very frequently, and will send you a private message telling you whether you've done it correctly. If, after a few minutes, you've not received a message, assume it is down. Please message the moderators letting us know it's down.

Second

* Check your arrogance at the door. 

* **Check your arrogance at the door.** Nobody cares how awesome you are. Self-gloating or other wankery will not be tolerated. This community is **principally** about the next rule. 

* This is community is about HELPING others progress their productions and improve their production skills. This ideal is absolutely paramount to this subreddit. A give and take is to be expected.

* Please have a specific question in mind, the last measure comes off a little cheesy, any ideas?"" etc.

* **ADDED** Along with the previous point

* Please make an effort to comment on others' questions. Even if you can't give any production tips, please be as descriptive in your opinion, and hence as helpful as possible.

* Courtesy and respect are to be expected. This is a gray area between this and the next section. Yes
 This also includes bullshit
 * ""this is not dubstep"" (Unless you're claiming like a house track is dubstep
 * ""shut up hipster""
 * ""I'm sick of all these rusko fanboys""
 
 or other elitist attitudes. **Please, but you do have to treat each other civilly. 

* Oh hey... there's a search function. Please use it before posting a question.

Lastly

* **Absolutely no exchanging of warez or suggestions of piracy. Your post will be removed. Subsequent infractions will result in a ban.** You have been warned.

* If we have any reason to believe you have anything to gain financially from any submission

* Any and all [Feedback] or [Listen] type threads are **NOT** allowed. We now have a [weekly feedback thread](http://www.reddit.com/user/EDMFeedback). Ask for any feedback in the most recent feedback thread. Any threads made that should be a comment in the designated feedback threads will be removed.

* No threads which make it clear the OP has not read the side-bar. It is there for a reason. It's extensive

 This rule includes:

 * ""How do I get started?"" 

 * ""I'm a beginner."" 

 * ""How do you make dubstep?"" 
 
 * Questions about which gear to buy. There is so much information out there--every gear thread is the same.

 For the love of all that is holy

* Lastly

 * Hey all

 * Listen to this Deadmau5 track!

 * I'm sick of all this dubstep

 Will be removed.

1372922271.0,1hmeab,Great post on the WHY of compression rather than the how. Got any others?,findMyWay,84,7,40,"Most compression tutorials just teach you what the knobs do

""This is such a difficult and loaded topic to address. But I'll give you my perspective. 

The better you get as a producer, you will already know what steps are required in the making of that sound. The line(s) between sound design and mixing become blurred. The reason I say this is because if a sound that uses compression as an effect (i.e. compressin the shit out of it) comes to you, you'll see it as such. Just as when you hear a big BWOW-ey bass sound in you head, you know it's time to abuse the ol cutoff knob. 

The other way of compressing (not going for a compressed sound) is usuall more of a problem solving thing. you might say to yourself ""this snare isn't popping enough, or this snare is TOO poppy or whatever. 

The simplest way I can put is: first learn what compression sounds like. Then

1. You need a single modern-talking oscillator. The bend -/+ gives the majority of waveforms a nice wet sound. The pitch modulation gives it the dropping sound
2. You need a band-reject filter. High-resonance gives it an even wetter high-end. Configure it as so: http://i.imgur.com/weORS.png

Seeing as how this course is for *you*

- Should this course be designed for someone with absolutely no musical experience whatsoever (read: going over rudimentary theory before really digging into Ableton) or should I assume you guys know the basics of songwriting? (major/minor triad construction, etc.)

- How frequently do you want me to post lessons?

- Should this course start after most colleges let out (I guess a few weeks from now) or should it start ASAP?

- What other suggestions do you guys have? I'm looking into RedditU

I saw loads of topics and threads about mastering and since I've subscribed to this subreddit

I've had scores of tracks and remixes mastered at pretty much every major mastering company that does dance music and here's a few points about what I learned:


**What is mastering?**

Mastering in dance music is the craft of fixing glaring mistakes and trying to use the source material and manipulate it in a way that makes it sound as best as it can.

Mastering engineers will typically use, wide and punchy as possible.


**Why use a third party mastering guy?**

I believe hearing someone else master your work is actually quite a good thing

Having someone who has not spent dozens of hours on your track means that they have a bit more perspective than you

**Can you polish a turd?**

No you can't polish a turd, they can't fix and perfect a track because they simply don't have THAT much control over your tracks once it's been bounced.


**Can I master stuff myself? (Is mastering needed) **
The most important part of your production (aside from creative ideas) is the mixdown. If your shit is mixed tight and perfect

Almost every single thing that a mastering engineer does or fixes can be addressed by you at the mixdown stage.

**Howcome my tracks aren't loud enough?**
That's because you haven't mixed them right...


**A few quick notes**
- If something doesn't sound right and it's sent to mastering

- Not all mastering guys are always awesome, do good work and bad work.

- Try making your mixdowns sound as good as you can without any mastering plugins.

- If your tracks sound shit hot with just a limiter thrown on at the end

Ways to get width and depth in a mix:



1.) Chorus stuff. Try chorusing only one side of a signal. Can be cool with clean electric guitars.



2.) Flip a side on a stereo track out of phase



3.) Haas effect--delay one stereo side on an element or two by 10 milliseconds or so.



4.) Make an aux buss with a pitch shifter on it: detune one side by 6-16 percent



5.) Buss a few things to an aux with a delay on it. Go sparingly. Ping pong delay can be fun on high hat.



6.) Create an aux buss with a stereo widener on it like Waves S1. Run various stuff to it.



7.) Put a flanger or phaser on an aux buss with a panner. Run a few things to it ever so slightly. You shouldn't really hear it



8.) Create a drum buss



9.) If you are doing primarily sampled drums ala electronic/industrial music try running a mix of the drums to a set of speakers in the live room. Now mic the room in stereo. Add to mix. Fun



10.) Create a buss and run some snare to it. Pitch shift it down an octave. Mix it in a little bit.



11.) Put 20 milliseconds of delay on your room mics to make the room feel bigger.



Add some of the above ideas along with proper and judicious use of reverb and your tracks will take on new life and size.



If you need the sounds to have 'verb but still stay present in the mix you need to pay attention to the following:



1.) You're running the 'verb as an aux buss or send, make sure the verb is 100% wet on the aux buss. That way you get 100% of the dry sound, plus however much 'verbed sound depending on how much you buss to the aux.



2.) Pre-delay is your friend. That gives the dry sound a chance to be heard before the 'verb cloud starts building up. 20 milliseconds is a good starting point. Anywhere from 10 to 60 milliseconds is common. That will keep things up front



3.) Brighter 'verbs feel closer to the listener. Use a shelf or lowpass filter to knock off some top end off the verb. Try a roll off around 3-6 khz for starters. Will move the 'verb in the background



4.) Time the verb (RT60) to work with the tempo of the song. Works wonders in reducing the sonic clutter.



5.) Dampening absorbs high freqs over time



6.) Try increasing the low end decay time or shortening the high end. That's how you get huge without being too spitty on top.



7.) For percussion the main thing that determines the ""size"" of the space is what's happening on the snare. Maybe less overhead 'verb and a bit more snare. Heck, but is big with a nice decay to it.



8.) Setting a balance between early reflections (ER) and the reverb tail is a key to the psychoacoustic distance the listener will perceive. Don't go nuts with the ER's,,False,,t5_2sa4x,False,,True

1) The ""danceable"" parts of most EDM songs are modal. They don't seem to have a well defined chord progression.

2) The breakdown part of most EDM songs are tonal. They have a well defined chord progression.

3) A lot of EDM songs avoid cadences. There doesn't seem to be a  sense of conclusion.

4) Above 3 points help make EDM danceable.

I would love to hear your thoughts.

2) Add reverb to the high signal. I'd suggest about 75% wet signal with a pretty spacey reverb - you don't want a rattle or echo effect though. I'd also suggest adding an eq after the reverb and rolling off the highest ranges

3) Add slight overdrive and chorus to the mid signal. Open the synth patch and find the dominant sound wave. Duplicate that wave (either in the patch or by adding yet another instance of the synth) and then detune both waves by the same amount in opposite directions. It will likely only need be about 5 cents.

4) Boost the bass signal a bit using an eq or bass boost plug in. And either a subtle phaser or automate the threshold of the filter you placed on it on (1) with a random sine with low range (that is

You might also want to alter the waveform and envelopes in the bass to prevent it from getting to croaky. Increasing the attack of the volume envelope is a good place to start. 

5) Route all three through a bus and add compression and a saturation plug in (the free camel crusher plug in is sterling).  Eqing again and slightly boosting the main frequencies (use your ears or a graphic eq - don't boost the fundamental freq but go for the second or third instead for some brightness).

6) Finally - and I think this is what a lot of you are missing - wide chords on the MIDI input. Use root, another octave and a third above, for example. Leaving space at the bottom and only using third/seventh notes well away from the root note helps make a chord sound big without it being muddy.",,False,,t5_2sa4x,,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/ngb7q/quick_guide_to_creating_the_full_synths_you_kids/

1353190002.0,13dbtp,Synth Recipe 6: Clicky FM Bass,mark-henry,84,12,34,"Today we’ll be recreating the bass from [“Keys To The City” by MiM0SA](http://youtu.be/oraTOij6wi0#t=36s). It has a sub bass low end and a very distinctive clicky top.

This will be our first foray into FM bass synthesis! Instantiate your favorite DAW and let’s get started.

**The Key**

An FM dubstep wub is made by simple waveforms FM-modulating each other. More FM makes a brighter sound

Different styles of wub are made with different combinations of waveforms and FM modulation routings. For example, and the high sine modulating the low sine.

This recipe describes another simple routing configuration.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* An FM synth. (Ableton Operator, etc.)

**Get Cooking**

1. The first and most important thing is to modulate the FM amount. You can bind it to an LFO [^[In ^Operator]](http://imgur.com/7P9aa) or you can bind it to your mod wheel and wub manually

2. First

2. Now for the modulator. Set a second oscillator to a saw wave and have it FM the first oscillator. You’ll get some ridiculous distorted sound, turn the second oscillator’s volume down. -19dB was a good setting for me.)

3. Now have the second oscillator modulate itself. [^[In ^Operator]](http://i.imgur.com/mPfN9.png) Set the modulation amount to about 50%.

4. Put a 24dB notch filter at 500Hz

4. Now the fun part. Mess with all the parameters until you like the result. I recommend messing with the partials of the second oscillator. Playing with the Phase knob can also have some very dramatic effects. In Operator, much brighter.

**Finishing Touches**

I believe that it was said by High Rankin in his master class: a tiny bit of distortion can turn a bass completely on its head. And don’t forget about RoughRider

Because the sub is overwhelmingly loud

**Serve Shaken

Any questions? Please share what you made from this recipe in the comments. What sound would you like to hear in upcoming episodes?

1347820429.0,zzbwn,So I'm finally trying to learn Synthesis...,uFonics,93,21,44,"
Hey r/edm! I've been producing with ableton for about 8 months now. As a beginner I'm obviously always looking for that thing that will make my music just that much better. In the past it's been my discovery of massive and some other higher end vsts as well as buying some vengeance packs. The two things I'm realized were missing are my little knowledge of mastering

So I've decided to finally do it and take the time to learn all I can about synthesis! I won't stop until I can create all the sounds in my head as well as recreate the sounds in my favorite songs.

I've learned the basics (I'll post what I've learned below and maybe you can critique anything I have wrong)

And here's a summary of what I've learned so far. Please let me know if I've got anything wrong. If there's a ""?"" after it means I'm not sure. 

Oscillator (OSC): Produces waveforms. As frequency of waveforms change pitch of note changes. 

Velocity: This is basically how hard or fast a not it played and the resulting sound.

Gate On/Off: When on sound won't pass through to output.

Envelope: How the waveform acts over time. This is generally measured in ADSR (Attack, and Release). Attack is how long it takes a not to reach it's peak volume. Decay is how long it takes to ""settle"" at a specific volume. Sustain is how long the note remains at that volume, and release is how long it takes for the note to go silent.

Sine wave: One frequency

Saw wave: Harmonic frequencies at all whole numbers? It creates a harder buzzing sound.

Square wave: Harmonic frequencies on odd numbers? Sort of a mix between a saw and a sine creating an almost hollow sound. 

Triangle wave: Like a square only harmonics get quieter as time goes on. Sounds similar to a square

Highpass filter: Allows high frequency sounds to pass through while cutting out low frequencies as the cutoff is turned up.

Lowpass filter: Allows low frequency sounds to pass through while cutting out high frequencies as cutoff is turned down.

Bandpass Filter: generally cuts both high and low when cut off is in the middle

Bandreject filter: generally cuts out mid range frequencies when cut off is in the middle

Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO): Generates a very slow/wide waveform

Additive Synthesis: Combining waveforms to create new sounds.

Subtractive Synthesis: Removing frequencies to create a new sound.

FM Synthesis: Using waveforms to ""modulate?"" other waveforms. FM synthesis is unpredictable and the ways sounds interact can only be memorized.

**EDIT:** I am beginning to believe I should be organizing this contest. I am thinking so far that it should be focused on the free VST soft synth

The big question remaining is how the contest should be judged. I would love to have some input but I already have some ideas:  

* Should there be voting? If not
* On what criteria should a patchmaking contest be judged? 
* How should people submit demos of their patches? Should there be one demo song MIDI that everyone has to arrange to their patch? 
* What kind of time frame would people like to make their patch? A few weeks? More time? Less time? 

Also

**EDIT 2:** Let's hear ideas for themes! (And if you don't think we should have themes

Some ideas for themes I have are: 

* Patches attempting to recreate actual instruments
* Single patches that work ~~well~~ as chords
* Standards with twists: e.g. reese basses that are different ""somehow, etc.
* Barely musical sounding patches that almost make you think you're just imagining the music being played through them

...but I doubt my ideas are the best ideas. Maybe *you* have the best ideas so you should suggest those.

Just a small update

In an on going efforts to improve the content quality of the subreddit

We've decided on pushing this idea since it has several obvious advantages. There are often quite a lot of ""how do I make this sound?"" posts, or at the most a very small demographic. The thread would also have the advantage of consolidating all the ""How do I make this sound"" questions, Having one page with all of them would be ideal for the people who would usually benefit from the responses to these kinds of questions.

We'd also like to ask that

Hopefully this will help in making the subreddit a better resource for everyone. We want more content which *everyone* can benefit from

* Side-chain compression can be used for much more than just drums. For example: have a bassline and a lead fighting for the same space? Some subtle side-chaining can solve that. It's also a great way to get a vocal track to sit in a mix. The key generally is to use it subtly. If you want to get really fancy with it


* Reverb. A mix-engineer once told me that if you can hear that a track has reverb on it, but a subtle *almost* inaudible reverb can make a synth or sample really come alive. The same can be said for delays.


* Parallel-compression (aka New York-compression). Set up a compressor with a high ration


* The Haas-effect. The haas-effect is a great way to give mono synths/tracks stereo width. The effect is basically to make a copy of the channel you want to apply to the effect two


* Multi-band distortion. A great way to give a synth/sample some grit is to use several different types of distorion on different frequency bands. Generally it's a good idea to give the lower bands less distortion to retain some of the base-tonality

That said, outside of a couple ""first!"" internet types, no one cares all that much. If music is genuinely good when it's put up for free, it will still be good when we give it a proper retail release to a wider audience. Most music is still ""new"" to the vast majority of people out there, and most music sent in for demo consideration isn't getting signed anyway!

In regards to etiquette though, so we can sign a social climber?

If being signed is that important to you, tracks with crazy samples, etc.). Or throw up a snippet of an original if you're just that anxious. But it's better to breathe.

Be original, whether you're signed or not

Applying theory knowledge: how exactly do you guys go around applying what you know about music theory to your own tracks? Do you sit down an say ""I am going to write this lead in A lydian""? or what? I have fairly decent music theory knowledge but I don't know where to start using it.

How it works:

I am planning on creating a large sample pack with only submissions from users of this subreddit. Each week we will have a different type of sample to submit. I will collect all the samples and figure out a way to judge them (I need judges). At the end we will organize all the samples in to a large pack and put it up for download on the subreddit.

Keep in mind:

1. All submissions must be original. No stealing or sampling. We don't want to get in trouble.
2. Email your submissions to edmpsamples@gmail.com as an attachment. We don't want to have to go through the comments to find download links.
3. Try and keep the samples well named/formatted. It would be good to name the sample something that actually makes sense for the sample. Also
4. Be creative. We have an incredibly diverse range of styles on the forums

Schedule:

Week 1: Kicks

Week 2: snares/claps

Week 3:Cymbals

Week 4:Percussion

Week 5:Loops

Week 6:FX (risers

Week 7:???

Who knows how long this will continue!

Today I’m here to inform those who care for the genre on *how I* produce my tracks/basslines and beats. First off

**Starting a track: ** 
-	With neurofunk, and play with the cymbals.  
-	I loop this for around 8 – 16 bars (starting at the 16th bar of the project
-	Now I tune all drums to a pitch that sounds good with the vibe I’m going for (you can use a sine wave patch and play a note

**Basslines: ** 
-	This is where the fun really kicks in for me. Grab your favorite bass patch (could be anything, modern talking even!) and make a rhythm with it (don’t focus on melodic content, as this is funky shit and shouldn’t be constrained by the limits of scales and such)  
-	Beef up your bassline (no. don’t reach for the sausage fattener. Don’t.)
-	Reduce the mud as much as you can (EQ, they are key to ultimate funkiness.  
-	Bounce this all down (have at least 16 bars of various rythms) and chuck in a sampler (or just another audio track) and process again (I use harmor before this to put a nice overall chorus/distortion/unison effect over it)  
-	Layer various versions of the bassline with each other (crossfade for some awesome effects)

**Ambience/leads/other synths: ** 
-	I’m not as good at these as of yet.   
-	Tons of random sounds/samples work well
-	Process with heavy amounts of effects to get weird warped sounds
-	Clean everything up

**Mixing and mastering: ** 
-	As a rule for myself
-	The kick and snare should punch just out over the bassline and hats can be turned down as quiet as possible (unless they play a key role in your rhythmic pattern
-	Slamming the crap out of your track with compression/saturation will do you no good. You need to be extremely careful when playing with the dynamics of a neuro track as it can make or break a track. Although, as it keeps dynamics intact, but clips transients. Be careful, and always reference the unmastered version with the mastered version.  
-	If your master turns out bad

I think that covers the basics of neurofunk

- I have made a seperate Word document for each genre and placed them all in a zipped folder. This was the easiest way I could think of to do this.  

- **If someone can upload these to Google Docs and post a link in the comments it might be much more convenient. (I couldn't get Docs working)**

- If anyone has any issues with downloading or being unable to open the documents

- I sorted everyone into groups based on your comment. If you're unsure if you might be in a genre group or not **check anyway**. 

- Open the document and use Ctrl + F to find your **username** not artist name.
 
- Ctrl + Click on the other members of your groups' usernames to open their profile

- **Make sure to send the other members in your group/groups a PM**. This is the only way this will work.

- Together with everyone in your group

- I recommend [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) for this purpose.


-----

Possible Issues

- You may be in a group with two people or four people due to numbers problems.

- If you feel you shouldn't be in a group and want to leave

- If you feel you should be in a group and you are not

- If you missed out on the submission thread and want to join the previous point applies.

- I may have made a few mistakes amalgamating genres that may not be similar even though they have similar names. Apologies if that has happened

- I also included a spreadsheet with all the genres and their members in the folder. **I feel that if one of the mods could sidebar a link to that spreadsheet in Google Docs or whatever it might be useful for future reference or contacting members of a genre for help or whatever.**

1.  Google is your friend, and Googling it is the quickest way to get an answer.  Reddit search can be helpful as well.  Some people dislike it.  If you want reddit-only results but hate reddit search, try using Google and adding ""site:reddit.com"" to the end of your search string.

2.  Before asking any question, somebody here knows exactly how to do it, but you'll learn a LOT more if you at least tried to figure out part of it on your own.  Anybody who's been producing for any length of time will tell you that this kind of exploration is invaluable.  While you might find the answer to your question, more often than not you'll discover something completely different that is exciting or useful.  

3. Ask your question well.  Be very clear/specific about what you are asking.  List out the steps that you have already taken on your own to answer the question yourself.  If you are referencing a track

4. Choose a title that is specific and concise.  This is just courtesy.  A good title will direct people to or away from your question depending on what they are trying to get out of the sub.  

5. Above all, read it anyways.  You never know what you'll find in the comments.  If you have feedback or know the answer even partially, by all means comment!  Did you read a jargon term you didn't know?  Look it up, memorize it, and use it where it's appropriate.  The more you learn about making EDM, the better your questions will be (and you'll have them less often to boot).

Your mission is to create a track in the following fictitious genre. Interpret this genre description however you wish

fulfills your vision of this genre. You may use any sound sources you desire in this competition.

Genre: Etiamunda

Tempo: Adagio

Time signature: 4/4

Instrumentation:

    Natural percussion, etc.)

    Long droning chords in deep pads and airy harmonics.

    And highly rhythmical synths with shorter articulations such such as pizzicato, staccato, marcato, etc.

Characteristics:

    History: Sheet music recently discovered in an old stone hovel unearthed in an excavation in Cumbria gives us Etiamunda as the first hint at 

modern music composition. Cumbria is the place where the musical Skiddaw Stones were discovered in the early 1800s and the person who discovered 

them had also been

instruments the composer discovered new worlds in music that no other before had attempted.

    Structure: Inspired by the long rolling hills in Cumbria

there must also be an equal decrescendo. Based upon this simple formula, AABBAA, ABCCBA. In fact 

'Etiamunda' roughly translates from Latin as ""Even Wave.""

    Time frame: After analysis of the nearly 400 of the compositions we've discovered that no composition the composer wrote in Etiamunda exceeded 

1:40 seconds. It's still one of the great mysteries of music as to why this was

were performed was outdoors and no stringed instrument of the time could stay in tune for that period of time outside.

Ancillary:

    Cumbria is a cold place for most of the year. The land and forests are dark green and the rocky hills dark gray. Compound this with the fact 

that it rains there often and is as often foggy

often used the Dorian and Phrygian modes when not using the natural minor scale.

http://www.banjolin.co.uk/modes/dorian_mode.htm
http://www.banjolin.co.uk/modes/phrygian_mode.htm

    In a note found in a journal the composer wrote the following: ""The system of waves coming in from the ocean is miraculous: they are at first 

shallow and even

they are but a trickle on the beach. Should not everything in life be the same? Should not every music be so modeled?""

    Sometimes but not always the compositions would change time signature and key at the climax of the piece then return to the original time 

signature at the decrescendo.

    Natural harmonics within the strings were employed often.

This is a continuation of the last genre comp as it would be a shame to waste those tracks.

The submission and voting form will be presented when MWD finishes it
and there will be an update as to how and where

(if there are any issues

deadline isnt wholly decided but the *latest* it will be is the 16th of feb

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* A synth that lets you edit the waveform manually and has a unison feature. I recommend Oatmeal

**The Key**

This sound is powerfully simple: a single oscillator with tight unison for flavor. It demonstrates that an energetic and charismatic lead doesn’t have to come from an expensive effects chain.

**Get Cooking**

1. Preheat your synth to saw wave degrees Fahrenheit. In Oatmeal

2. Find your unison control and put it at 2 or 3 voices. In Oatmeal, get a Multi Osc going. Find a nice sweet spot for the detuning. Not too narrow, not too crazy.

3. Now set the overall voices to one (so that when you press two notes at once it only plays one of them). Set up some 30ms portamento/glide and boom, so [here’s](http://imgur.com/FWSAm) what the three controls should be set to. The middle one's at about 30ms.)

**Tweaks**

You’ll probably notice that MiM0SA’s synth doesn’t match up exactly to what we have here. He’s got some EQing in the mix — a dip at 5 KHz and a boost above that — but the real trick is that he’s not using a saw wave

Now’s the time for Oatmeal’s user-editable-waveform feature to shine. [Bring up the custom waveform display](http://i.imgur.com/CDKM9.png) and start playing with the bars. Each one of these bars represents a volume control on a sinewave. Each sinewave is tuned to a specific frequency in the overtone series. (Math.) Each member of the overtone series is called a harmonic.

Wiggle them one by one. Now move a bunch at once. [Chop holes in the series](http://imgur.com/1OSrC) to make weird timbres. Go crazy because this is fun-exploring-time. You’ll probably notice that the lower harmonics individually have more of a say in the final sound than the high tones. Now go for subtle

My final recommendation is a little compression. That’s about all you need; the power of this sound is in its simplicity. Like too much soy sauce on the finely seasoned and vinegared rice used for sushi

**Serve With Fresh Beats**

Any questions? What would you like to hear next week?

Share your work in the comments! Last time, Sahak_!

Hi, so please tell me what you think in the comments. These first few episodes serve as an intro to basic sounds for beginners, so if single-oscillator leads aren’t exactly unexplored territory for you, well, stay tuned.

[Take a look at my bassline lesson!](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/v817q/a_simple_lesson_in_creating_basslines_level/)

So let's say you've thrown a song together but are missing the key piece of the track - the melody. Without this the listener will probably not remember it as well as they would have if you had a great melody in it. That's what your listeners will be humming far after the song is over (there are exceptions to this but most generally this is the case). To put it plainly

In this lesson I'll be going over one of my more melody-driven tracks. I'll be going into it one layer at a time so you can understand where I came from while producing it.

****

My first song example is called Daylight Crossing Train. You can listen to it [here on Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/373797). It was featured on a [flash game](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/576557) that ended up on the front page of [joystiq.com](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/13/sorry-did-you-want-game-news-were-too-busy-playing-symphonic/) and I happened to have the starting song for the game. To put it plainly

Let's start with my chord progression. I tend to make my chord progressions before the melodies. And when that gets satisfactory I then make the rest of the song. The song will showcase the melody so if I can't produce a good one I end up dropping the song altogether. (That will happen

**** 

Now onto the actual melody. I'm using a piano sound for this track as I love a good trance track featuring piano. Let's take a look at the notes first. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/knF3C.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?7hhbtttjmeee3ui)

A great way to start any melody is to have a simple rhythm going every 2 measures. Keep that rhythm consistent

Other than rhythm stick to what you know about your chord progression. Keep the notes within their scales. This song is the perfect example. Once you can get a handle on this kind of melody writing you can really get crazy and end up with some cool sounding songs. EDM in general is about repetition. There. I said it. What keeps the song going in EDM is the layering and the progression through the changing layers whereas in classical music (and other genres of music) you have the actual progression driving the song. Melodies don't repeat as often as they do in EDM. You can have the most simple melody in EDM and it can be a big radio hit. 

[Here's an mp3 of the melody in the song](http://www.mediafire.com/?ytpce3ju5rd2ko9)

****
Let's break this down even more. Here I have a simplified version of that piano melody. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/S8i1A.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?7e2da20pqcv2zxs)

What are the notes in the simplified melody compared to my chords? **[A picture I'll be referring to.](http://i.imgur.com/NPpeN.png)** Take the first note of each measure. I've labelled them accordingly to what they are in the chord progression. You can see I stick to playing the 3rd or root of the chord. This doesn't mean you shouldn't play any other notes but in this example I'm keeping it simple. What I did later on was put on some ""sprinkles."" [Picture reference](http://i.imgur.com/ddk68.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?re8p4rz1lxwtz61) This is the perfect example of how a simple melody can become much more complicated. 

**For you more experienced producers out there**

1349362769.0,10xs4s,An idea I've been toying with: Songs as living organisms.,thatsapaddlin,82,20,70,"Edit: Thank you all for the brilliant ideas

So I had an idea I wanted to discuss and see what everyone's thoughts are on it.  First, it was unique every time it was performed and heard.  That ephemeral quality has dissipated somewhat with the invention of records, tapes, CDs and hard drives, though for most non-electronic / non-DJ performances the music does change when it is performed live.  Now with the rise of the DJ, almost everything you hear is pre-recorded.  True that the mixes will sound slightly different sometimes but it is still performed with pre-recorded materials.

Onto the idea:  what if a song was a living organism, structure, content and subtle timings would be different?  The overall style or theme would stay the same, but the permutations would be endless.  Generative music has existed since the 18th century, where some composers (Johann Philipp Kirnberger for example) used dice as an element of chance in determining the composition.  Today generative techniques are used very commonly especially in electronic music.  But once the piece is created, it is recorded and made static.  What if songs were not only written, but CODED so that each song had it's own special algorithm that determined the result?  Even further, you could determine the listeners location

Icarus' album Fake Fish Distribution did something like this

I'm thinking of a web application that would act as the interface for users to browse 'songs'.  The system would keep say, perhaps the generations are created on-demand in order to be tailored to things like the aforementioned weather scenario.  

Maybe sometime way in the future,False,,t5_2sa4x,1349456907.0,,sc,t3_10xs4s

**Things you should not do when commenting on an /r/edmproduction AMA**:

 * DO NOT post questions unrelated to electronic music production. Be smart here. The mods will have final say over what qualifies as a good question.

 * DO NOT leave a top level comment without a question. These create unnecessary clutter in the thread and make it harder for the OP to find quality questions to answer. Nobody cares how much you love *artist name here*.

 * DO NOT plug your own music / attempt to receive feedback on one of your songs. These artists probably all have promo emails

 * Before asking a question, i.e. favorite vsti.

1. go to this [site](http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet)

        (function() {
            $('span[class*=\'flair-sc\'][title!=\'\']').live('hover'
                var e = evt.target

TUNE YOUR KICKS!

--------this is not just for dubstep/trap

So I've spent hours and hours going through so many different mastering chains on my master channel, however I felt like anytime I tweeked kick samples my sound always got muckier. But, I finally gave in after watching a [recent video](http://youtu.be/z2Ean7sG-jQ?t=4m38s) from my heroes Dada Life. 

Now

Quick Outline for Tuning Kick on Ableton 9:

* 1. Pull up drum rack with a kick playing on it's own channel.
* 2. Insert a ""Spectrum"" from Audio Effects in the browser.
* 3. With the kick playing through the Spectrum look at the wave form produced
* 4. Pick out the top of the hill and hover your mouse over it. be precise.
* 5. A box will display by your mouse telling you the frequency and also the ""note"" of the frequency
* 6. Use transpose function in the drum rack to change the pitch of the drum in steps to either the tonic or dominant of the key of your track and ""detune"" for even finer tuning. e.x. I hover the mouse it says G#1 and my song is in F

note: In my short experience I've found you don't want to be transposing a sample more than around 4 or 5 steps max

note 2: experiment using this technique on snares and any other percussion you like.

Happy to answer any other questions you might have or direct you to more learning materials related to the subject!

From the few tutorials that I've found on chord progressions and how to use them within this genre, preferably ending on the root chord for a nice resolving cadence, loop the first few bars of the loop before the release/break, use the root chord for bass, etc. I usually go this route with some variations, and it has been the most rewarding, however

Other variations I've seen, 3/4th of the bar for one chord and the last 1/4th for another, etc. 

Some variations seem more like ""chord stabs""

My question is

Now, go with it"". I can bullshit along and find a nice loop that sounds good once  every blue moon, but it's hard to fill an entire track with it.

How do you guys write chord progressions? What patterns do you use? How do you split them up? Are they supposed to define a melodic pattern or are they more like guidelines for the chord/notes you should focus on in a particular segment of a track?

Unlike past attempts at massive collaborations, please read the plan below, sign up at the link at the bottom, and head on over to /r/edmproductioncollab to begin discussing the project!


What follows below is the original post from /r/edmproductioncollab:


Welcome to the first r/edmproduction collaboration; this is going to be a great project! To make everything work smoothly we need to have some organization, and with any level of experience! But please only sign up if you know that you can deliver what you promise.

Contributors to the collaboration will be assigned to a particular team. When you sign up, and /u/Khedgey) will divide up everyone among the teams, and hopefully everyone will be placed on their first or second priority team. However, just because you don't get placed on a team does not mean that you cannot have a hand in that part of the process--please feel free to contribute suggestions and help to any part of the project. In fact, we encourage inter-team communication! Teams will be responsible for doing the bulk of the work in their area, making final call regarding creative decisions in their area, and providing their products by the deadline. When designing the teams we will try to make sure each team has a balance of experience levels so hopefully people can learn through this process. No team will be left without someone who really knows what they are doing.


The teams are as follows:

* Composition Team (Writing the core structure of the song)
* Lyrics Team (Writing the lyrics/phrasing/melody for the words)
* Rhythm/Samples Team (Creating the beats and rhythmic structures)
* Melody Team (Writing the melodies)
* Sound Creation Team (Creating the sounds for the basses
* Vocal Team (recording and then engineering)
* Arrangement (Combining all tracks into the final arrangement and adding connective tissue)
* Mixing Team
* Mastering Team

The schedule for the project is as follows:

* Signups (Until June 9th) -- Please sign up using the link at the bottom of this!
* Idea Phase (Week 1: June 10 - June 16) -- Everyone that wishes to be involved discusses an idea for what direction the song should go in. Do we want to make a Porter Robinson style pulsing trance song? Do we want to make Daft-Punkish stuff? Danceable song? Or chill song? Do we want to have a concept and try to send a message or tell a story? Or just let it be fun? Of course this will change as the pieces are put together
* Song Composition (Week 2: June 17 - June 23) -- Everyone on the composition team works together to compose the basic blocks of the song, 8 measures of drop out,"" etc), and a basic chord structure for the song. They can work on this through skype, exchanging snippets on soundcloud or dropbox, telephone, whatever. At the end of this period, even if its just some stock piano and pad sounds over some stock drum loops
* Lyrics writing (Week 2: June 17 - June 23) -- Working with the Composition Team, and phrasing. At the end of the week they will produce a vocal demo (quality doesn't matter) and a text document with lyrics written.
* Rhythmic Structure (Week 3: June 24 - June 30) -- The Rhythm/Samples Team will pound out the rhythm of the song and create those tracks. Did the composers call for a sexy samba beat for these four bars? Rhythm team can provide. Did the composers call for an uptempo build up? Rhythm team has it under control. At the end of this week
* Melodic Structure (Week 3: June 24 - June 30) -- The melody team (3-5 people) will take the composers' instructions and create melody. Do the composers call for an ascending intricate melody with counterpoint behind it? Melody team will provide. At the end of this week, but Melody Team can provide ideas for what sort of sounds they had in mind.
* Sound Creation (Week 4: July 1 - July 7) -- Sound Creation team (3-5 people) will take the chords from Composition Team and melodies from Melody Team and create kickass sounds for each of these. These are the guys that will be digging hard into Massive, they will produce individual bounced tracks the length of the song for each instrument/sound they create.
* Note: If some of the sounds depend upon other sounds (i.e., and this will allow the Mixing Team the opportunity to do this.
* Vocals (Week 3 - 4: June 24 - July 7) -- The Vocal Team can begin working as soon as they have the structure from the Song Comp team, or they can bring in someone they know), and cut them up/remix them, so that at the end of the week 4 they have a full vocal track for the song
* Arrangement (week 5: July 8 - July 14) -- During this time, stutters, swells, reverbed stuff in the background, etc. At the end of the week they will have tracks for each effect and sound, ready to give a full set of tracks to the mixing team.
* Mixing (week 5 - 6: July 8 - July 21) -- The mixing team can begin at week 5, and Vocal Team. This is where they will do the necessary hard core mixing/engineering. At the end of week 5, they will have the full arrangement from the Arrangement Team, to create a final mix.
* Tweaking (week 7: July 22 - July 28) -- The finished mix will be given to the whole community so anyone can comment on it. If something needs to be added, now is the time! Everyone should be paying attention during this week so if their team is needed, they can quickly respond to what is going on!
* Mastering (week 8: July 29 - August 4) -- Mastering
* Throughout the project the Core Team will be behind the scenes pulling everything together. We will be checking on the teams' progress, and will constantly keep the most final mix possible available to everyone. Did the rhythm team tweak something last night? We will add in the new tracks and then redistribute the new mix.

Submitting finished work:

* We will be using dropbox to organise and collaborate.
* You will need a dropbox account and you can get one here: http://db.tt/AbWGZdM (please use the referal link as we will get more space)
* You do not need to make a new dropbox account if you already have one
* There will be folders for each team and you should be able to work out how you are going to organise it within your team.
* However please try and make the folder structure tidy and easy to understand with folders for categories. For instance sort it by date or who made it.
* Preferably keep your files in wav
* Each team will have their own folder in the dropbox, please upload them in .wav format.

General Notes:

* It will be very important for these teams to work together within themselves; rather than 3 different people submitting their own versions of something
* The deadlines will be absolute, or wishes to change their contributions to better fit what others have submitted, they can do that for a few days. (Say, the melody team wants to tweak something based upon a cool groove the rhythm team created.)
* When uploading sounds, or EQ, (outside of what is necessary to create that specific sound) as these effects can make mixing very difficult. If you wish, feel free to add notes on what kind of extra effects you would like on the track.
* If you wish to include notes with your submission
* Everyone is allowed to give feedback on something after a team has contributed their piece
* Teams are encouraged to contribute more than the bare minimum. The sound team can contribute 3 different sounds for the melody instead of 1
* Help other teams with suggestions or discussion, even if they aren't what you had in mind or are not as good as you could have done. Even better, if they aren't as good as you can do, why not help them do it better? Send them a message or post in the subreddit with helpful advice, links to videos or tutorials, and give constructive criticism.
* Everyone will be on only one team, if you don't get placed on your first choice for team, this will be a good growth opportunity for you! And if this project is successful, we will do more in the future, and you will be on a different team next time around!
* There will be only one project
* Please be patient with us, please do not hesitate to contact us with your suggestions!

When we hear the final song, and we could repeat this process every three months! Also, once the project is finished, we will release all the stems from the project so that everyone in the community can have a go at remixing the track. Our hope is that by working closely with the people on your team and in the rest of the community, you will get to know some producers that you didn't know before, which could possibly spark some awesome new collaborations!

1369763451.0,1f7mno,Compressor attack time - Explanation,KaazEDM,74,17,41,"I read the ""there are no stupid questions"" thread and there was a lot about compressor attack times.

Basically the debate was the following: is the attack time how long the compressor takes before it starts compressing

Here is the explanation: **IT DEPENDS ON THE COMPRESSOR YOU ARE USING**.

To prove my point, which is not compressing anything (ratio 1:1, threshold all the way up just to be sure...).

[THIS](http://imgur.com/eHO8KK3) is the wave I'll be using for the demonstration, a brick of sound, to ensure that no dynamics come from the sound itself.

First

[HERE](http://imgur.com/3njMvWE) is what it looks like with a fast attack time. [HERE](http://imgur.com/f0ffUt6) is what it looks like with a slow attack time.

You can see that the transient stays intact. The only thing that changes is the compression slope.

Now
[HERE](http://imgur.com/BaV59rr) is the fast attack. [HERE](http://imgur.com/IqLkGVS) is the slow attack.

Here

I also tried with the FabFilter Pro-C (this time

So here you are:

* The Silver Compressor lets a certain amount of transient through and its attack time allows you to modulate the compression slope. 
* The MCompressor's attack time allows you to modulate both the amount of transient going through AND the compression slope.
* The FabFilter Pro-C barely lets any transient through and its attack time allows you to modulate the compression slope.

In conclusion

1.  The Release:  Obviously the most notable aspect of the pluck is the envelop on the LPF cutoff frequency.  The sound starts brighter and very quickly descends to a slightly duller sound, so the sound holds out longer as it gets brighter.  To do this, you can set a macro in Massive to control both the cutoff frequency in the filter and the release time in the AMP envelop (which by default is envelop 4). 

2.  The Amount of Filter Drop:  When the sound is in its initial dullest stage, assign the same Macro to the 'level' parameter in the filter envelop.  When the sound gets brighter as you open the filter, the sustain point needs to be lower.  

This all makes sense when you start playing around with these parameters.  Ideally, the release time will increase slightly, and the sound will still drop to a  duller sustain point even if the attack frequency gets very bright.  

Another cool tip:  assign the random parameter (TR next to the macros) to the amount of pitch spread between the voices.  If you're using unison mode, you can assign the random parameter to the pitch of one of the oscillators and give it a range of 3-5 cents.  This will result in a wider sound in the stereo field, so don't do this if your mix calls for a more-narrow sound.

This thing just saved me so much time and hassle

Here's a cool experiment. Take a channel that you have, but interfering with the high end in the drums. Put the rack on that.
Now take another channel (let's say a grouped track of drums) and send it to three new audio channels, renaming accordingly. 
Now go to the compressor in the rack on your grimy bass and route the corresponding drum channel to the sidechain for each compressor. Now you can adjust to taste how much you want each eq band to pump.

I really dig this because it's an efficient way to free up certain areas of the spectrum for a split second to let another instrument come through

**The Key**

This sound is made using a dead-simple FM synthesis recipe. I was lucky enough to recognize the sound at first listen because the formula is really easy to stumble upon through exploration.

**Ingredients**

* An FM synth of any description. FM8, WELL_GODDAMN_SON and Sachemdot were kind enough to recommend some free FM synths: Oxe FM, FMMF and VOPM.

**Get Cooking**

1. Set carrier to a sinewave at -1 octave. Set modulator to an at-pitch sinewave and turn the FM down until the sound mellows out a bit. Map the FM amount to your mod wheel or to an LFO and further adjust the FM amount and mod amount values until nice clean wubs result.

2. The timbre of the target sound has already been achieved! Let's make it even more wubbly by adding on a low-pass filter. Turn the frequency all the way down and crank the resonance. Map it to the mod wheel or LFO that you set up in the first step

3. We're still missing some minor timbral modifications. What you want to do next is set up another carrier-modulator pair

**Polish and Variations**

It's easy to turn this into other

A little distortion on the end of the chain can really enhance the character of the sound. A vintage tube can emphasize the garage flavor; a convoluted Ohmicide preset could be appropriate for neuro effects.

Try some stereo separation. A cheap-sounding spring reverb can create heavy space around the sound. Or try a touch of chorus to make it leap out of the mix — perfect for complextro-style one-shot wubs.

**The Key**

This is the characteristic sound of a vintage analog synth. This bass could have been made by any vintage synth you could name: it's just a simple waveform put through a resonant low-pass filter. As the filter envelope decays

This is very similar to Synth Recipe 3: Progressive-House Pluck. The difference is that it's monophonic

**Ingredients**

* An analog synth

**Get Cooking**

1. Set the synth to a saw wave and transpose -1 octave. Set the decay to about a second and the sustain to -10 dB.

2. Activate a low pass filter and its envelope. The decay should be at about two to three seconds. Set the resonance (sometimes labeled ""Q"") fairly high and slide the frequency down until the sound gets nice and dark. Envelope amount

**Polish and Variations**

A little tube distortion (I got good results with [BootEQmkII by Variety of Sound](http://varietyofsound.wordpress.com/downloads/)) really complements the vintage feel of this sound. Keep it tasteful.

Or don't. Turn the filter resonance all the way up

If you find a middle ground in the distortion department and turn the filter envelope down

If you're into vintage deep house stuff

**Please don't send me any song files yet!**

Common Questions:

- **When can I submit my track?** Track submissions will start once you accept my invite to the shared Google Drive folder called ""EDMP Compilation Submissions""

- **When does voting on the tracks start?** As of right now, that will probably happen before the 3rd party judge ranks them (while we're waiting on mastering). Unless we decide to have everyone master their own track, the 3rd party judge will not start judging until all the tracks are mastered, hopefully, second week in April. To be fair to everyone, the 3rd party judge should rank the mastered tracks only. Please add [mastered] or [pre-master] to the end of your file depending on what you decide to do.

- **Can I post my submission to any other sites during the competition?** Yes you can, and I'll have to remove it from the compilation.

- **Are there any restrictions on genre?** No

- **How can I share my work in progress submission with other subredditors?** Once the shared folder is created and you've accepted my invite to join it, delete them before then, and make sure you have the right VERSION of your track in the folder before then. If the rule vote decides that we're going to do both new and old releases as separate albums, there will be two shared folders.

- **If I don't leave enough headroom in my mix (-6 - 8 dB) or if I realized I screwed something up in the mix after April 1st

- **What if we don't find an engineer to volunteer and everyone submits unmastered tracks?** 
If we can't find a volunteer after the next two weeks, if need be, between the most experienced / willing members of the sub reddit. If that proves to be too time consuming, the judging will start with the pre-masters, with exceptions made for mastering-based problems, and then the top ranked songs will be gathered and sent to a volunteer, or I'll attempt to do it myself(lolz). **If we do find a volunteer soon, please let me know

I was just thinking once again about the amazing talent here and my appreciation of that talent.
I consider how fortunate I am to live during this time and experience all that's possible. 
I am driven to evangelize
Why does this matter to me? Why should this matter to anyone?  

Some of you guys and girls are among the best electronic artists out there. Whether you know it or not. Whether or not you are doing this as a hobby
You may not know it. You may not think it. You may not believe it.   

Hold on

Oh hell
You don't think? Take a minute and read it. It's an interesting story if you like ancient history in Internet years.  
Experience counts. You know it does. 

So, and a video production studio with professional equipment. 
I did on-location and in-house sound and video production with pro gear back in the 80's. All that gear was analog. All of it. Digital pretty much wasn't ""there"" yet. That's some perspective and experience
Tons of it. I was in Athens, The Point, 688, the Metroplex, the Cotton Club, the Uptown Lounge, etc. 
Did light &amp; sound work too
Part of this missive it to impart that now is an amazing time for all of you. (Yeah

I recorded my own music. At the time it was influenced by Skinny Puppy, the Cocteau Twins, the Butthole Surfers, and so forth. 

I did live sound, industrial artists, experimental, electronic pop, dance, ska, and rock &amp; indie artists. Between giving all the masters and studio recordings to the artists I'm kicking myself at how I have almost none of it now.  

I was a PC guy. So I had the program called Cakewalk to do MIDI work. It ran on the MS-DOS operating system
 
I worked with a Fostex 4-track, a SM58, a couple of PZM mic's, and whatever sends or sub-mix I could get from the house board. I built up my own studio and am fortunate that I had (comparatively) a lot of money for a college kid. 
In my studio as I built it up I had a Korg DDD-5 drum machine (12 bit resolution!), an Alesis Midiverb 3, a little Yamaha reverb unit, a MIDI patch bay, a Sony DAT recorder, a timecode interface, eventually a Mackie 1604 mixer, etc. 

OK so what?  Well the outputs of all these is *analog*
 
When we first got audio editing software for Windows
I'm from the dark ages. Yet I still had an amazing, had Fruity Loops when that's what it was called. Had Sonar, Have Sound Forge, ACID Pro, FL Studio, a bunch of other random audio programs, and now I've just picked up Ableton and Reaper. Year by year there's more and more out there and it's amazing. 
I'm not mentioning all this to brag. Tons of my experience isn't even with edm and edm production. I just want to give you an idea of all the stuff I've worked with and how it's influenced me

When I look at what I have now

One thing after all these years that I realize now is that I'm a far better sound engineer for *other people's music*. Years of output prove that. For my own, tracks, mixed or not. I haven't had a drink in 5+ years and that's the best decision I've ever made.  

I've known what I'm doing and yet have made bad decisions and wound up in a situation where pretty much anything I've done for someone else is better than for myself. That's OK if I'm OK with it. 
You hear the saying, but them can't do it."" 
For my own music, I didn't stay sober while working on it, and I didn't focus. Well I'm going to now. At least more than I did. I don't have the free time I once had, but I've got a whole new set of gear. Again I'm fortunate that I made some good life decisions and money is essentially no object.
But this isn't some ""wah

You say

OK, or think you can't--you're right either way. Be right that you can do it!
This stuff I hear from you guys is so inspiring and rewarding emotionally and artistically. Back then, to learn, to distribute or *sell* if we wanted that, which you do now. You have a universe available that I urge you again and again. 

And I want to throw out there that I'd love to mix, as I'll be working an IT project in Minnesota for a defense contractor.

1350174128.0,11fs68,Synth Recipe 5: Rolling Electro Bass,mark-henry,61,9,26,"Today we’ll be making [the effervescent bass from ""Sunset Boulevard"" by Paul Keeley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyQAMR0Y_No#t=79s). Open up a blank project in your favorite DAW and let’s get started.

Two MIDI loops today: [intro](http://www.mediafire.com/?f9koc8d850awu2r) and [main](http://www.mediafire.com/?njdz2syug01lozk).

**The Key**

A bass isn't all about bass tones. The most intense basses derive their energy from filling the frequency spectrum almost entirely.

This bass is, equalization, and mixing.

Its ""rolling"" quality has a lot more to do with the notes being played than you'd think. Paul Keeley makes this bassline exceedingly funky by playing with short vs. long notes and making skilled use of funky syncopations.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* A saw wave or something similar. (See [Recipe 2](http://redd.it/109wrb) for tips on creating your own saw-like waveform)

* Distortion and distortion and distortion. Definitely include a tube saturator in your selection.

* EQ

**Get Cooking**

1. The saw wave should have only enough attack and release to prevent popping. For bonus bass, also turn on glide/portamento and dial it in somewhere between 150-200ms.

2. EQ with a lowpass in the midrange. Don't worry; we'll get the top end of our spectrum back in the next step.

3. Distortion! I’ll take this opportunity to tell you guys about one of my favorite compressor plugins, like the he-men did it in times of myth."")

4. More distortion, tweaking the parameters around and exploring the sonic possibilities.

4. Now slap a final ""mixing"" EQ onto the end of the chain. Get the bass energy under control

6. Tweak the distortion and EQ (especially that first lowpass) until you get something that sounds nice. Keeley’s bassline strikes an excellent balance between the low and the high frequencies. It’s not too muddy

**That’s About It**

Once it’s time to mix your track

Also

**Sidechain and Serve**

**Hey everyone. Since there's so many tracks and I am only human so I don't think I'll get to everyones if there's any more submissions.**

**So to help your fellow EDM producers out

**This thread is a bit too busy now for me to see what I did and did not reply to...so If you have submitted your track on the thread here or the old thread from a couple of days ago and I haven't managed to get to you

https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=00970c24db6044f5982f3ec92796cea1




Hey everyone

**Quick background on who I am**
Some of your remember a post I made a few weeks ago, I also do mixdowns for a lot of projects.

**Why am I doing this?**
I strongly believe that by helping others

I also wished for some kind of help like this when I was starting out and will always appreciate the few people who did help me along the way and I'm just passing the torch.


**How this is gonna work**

I posted a thread two days ago in which I provided a URL for people to submit tracks to me. 

A lot of people also posted their music in that thread. If you are one of those people

If you have not already submitted your track via the other thread or my submission page

https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=00970c24db6044f5982f3ec92796cea1

So what I will do is reply to this thread and I'll reference your username like this: [/u/neonstereo!](http://reddit.com/u/neonstereo) and give you the feedback/critique!

If it takes me some time to get to your track

P.s. as a bonus



Someone PM'ed me the other day and asked me how they can thank me for doing this. If you like you can grab a copy of our new single on beatport via here: http://btprt.dj/1bB1Dcm or just simply pass the good will onto someone else who needs a helping hand when the time comes and you're in my position :)

1370837843.0,1g0xhp,Have you guys ever tried this before?,CrayonColorDinosaur,67,16,42,"Just within the hour before typing this I was messing around in Logic trying to infuse two kick samples into one personally customized kick that I can call my own after some inspiration from a youtube video. 

After a bit of tweaking and trying my best to get something good, and an adaptive limiter (in that order) on the summing bus and I bounced out the result. 

I then brought my new sample back in to the DAW (same session) to listen to it again and because I like to look at the new waveform. When I hit play I noticed that it sounded different than before the bounce and I realized that I forgot to bypass the plugins on the summing bus so it basically got resampled. Although it sounded different I thought it sounded a lot better in my opinion
Then I bounced that sample and did the process again out of curiosity and ended with an even more punchy kick than the last. 

It turned out to be a complete accident, I thought I might as well share it with my fellow knob twisters.  

The only bad thing I noticed though was that there was artifacts that became more apparent after each bounce (in total I bounced it 3 times) especially in the tail

If you want I could put the samples up on my soundcloud in bounced order so you guys can here the differences.

**EDIT:** Hear are the samples in sequential order of bouncing/resampling https://soundcloud.com/empmusic-1/kicks-resampling-process and they're free for download!

So I guess the problem here is that a lot of intermediate producers want vocalists on their songs and a lot of intermediate vocalists want to find producers for their own songs and/or do features for EDM producers. Unfortunately

To solve this I am thinking about creating a website where both vocalists and producers can come to network and connect.

Each person would be categorized as either a vocalist or producer and have their own profile where it includes samples of their music and they can private message each other or exchange information to eventually collaborate.

**TL;DR: A website where producers and vocalists find each other to collaborate.**

So I feel it's important to provide some insight into the community traffic

Reddit has its own statistical analysis that is provided for the mods only--I think this is because Reddit probably has to produce the statistics every time you request them

**First the Subreddit's Stats**

Just an quick note:

* Uniques are unique people--by IP. So you're only counted as one unique no matter how many times you visit in that time period. 

* Impressions are page views.

[Traffic By Hour](http://i.imgur.com/P2JlC.png)

Either our producers like to stay up late and sleep through the day

[Traffic by Day](http://i.imgur.com/Asys4.png)

What I find most impressive about this is we are averaging 1500 unique visitors per day

[Traffic by Month](http://i.imgur.com/JsI1S.png)

2012 has been a fantastic year for us so far! For god only knows what reason, and we've almost surpassed February. 25,000 unique visitors last month--only 1/5 of those are subscribers--140,000 pageviews. This is truly exciting news.

**Feedback Thread Statistics**

I've done some of my own data analysis for the Feedback thread. It

[Feedback Thread Statistics](http://i.imgur.com/AN83x.png)

Ok so the left side of the graph deals with the bars, but that will come in another graph later.

The red line indicates the average number of children for each root comment including ones with 0 children. I'd say there is definitely a slight increasing trend in this

[Zero Reply Percentage](http://i.imgur.com/UkHTT.png)

This graph plots the percentage of root comments that have zero replies. Without a doubt, we are seeing a large percentage increase in the number of people receiving it. That means this community is growing in a big, important way. We'd love to see an even higher percentage of people receiving feedback, so definitely pay attention to those threads! I think with the new schedule of posting feedback threads whenever they die, this trend will continue to improve.

I don't want to come across like I'm ripping on his point or anything because I actually really love it and do agree with it personally, a beautiful soaring cacophony of atypical literary mush flies out of the speakers; which means all that meaning was just me projecting my thoughts, really. Terms like ""waves of space and time"" and ""floating"" just scream *""I'm catering to people who are rolling""* and come across as almost kind of cringe-worthy to the sober. Maybe there's an aspect of the narrative I'm missing but the actual indeterminate nature of language, as the name suggests the song is about, is barely even alluded to. This approach to EDM lyric and story-writing ultimately dogs the culture at large, I fear, in the same way LSD and *feelin' groovy* did to counter-culture in the 60s and 70s; it becomes a parody of itself. I'm not ripping on people who roll either but there's no way some of these lyrics or themes stand up on their own accord.

There's a lot left to the imagination in EDM themes and lyrics and I'm sorely aware of how much people like to assimilate and project their own feelings into the media they enjoy. EDM comes across to me kinda like 'fill in the blanks' in terms of themes and ideology, but I fear tracks with nigh-on no intelligent narrative whatsoever like [Kyoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86khmc6y1yE) by Skrillex permeate the scene as a result. It's not that the music is bad, it's that the song says... nothing, really. I get the feeling this is because, kinda like jazz, the audience is there arguably for the instrumentation and not a vocalist. Of course this isn't always the case, there are brilliant examples of EDM lyrics telling a legitimate story like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5ykbAumD4) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di5AT4MI6BY)

Like, but it messes up the measures grid for the rest of the track afterwards.  You zoom out and want to move stuff around

Well, 8, 16, 32, etc...  So anyway, I just had this flash of insight on how to trick ableton to making the grid restart one bar later.  You make it think that one bar is actually 4 bars, by changing the time signature of that bar to 1/4.  Then when the beat drops again, and notice how the zoomed out grid starts with your drop

Oh I'm pleased as punch about this.  Is this a known thing

EDIT:  OK, make the bar before the the ""extra"" into a time signature with however many extra beats you want to add.  In my case, I want to add 4 extra beats, so I make the last bar before the extra bar into 8/4.

- People producing similar genres are pooled together.

 [genre competition #1 info](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/w57gw/redmproduction_genre_competition_1/)

  Hey everybody! We're back with genre competition #2. This genre was invented by our previous winner

  **Your mission is to create a track in the following genre. Interpret these directions however you wish

  Genre: Bunk (sometimes referred to in full as 'Bodyfunk')

  Tempo: 105 - 115 bpm

  Time signature: 4/4

  Instrumentation: Punchy kicks &amp; snappy gated-reverb snares

  Characteristics: Often dubbed the most badass of all EDM-styles, the former is born out of the cocaine-fueled, Western equivalent of that era: Electro Funk. Bunk gains it's weight and heaviness not from cliché distortion, aggressive chainsaw bass or heart-attack kicks but rather from the unprecedented fierce swing grooves it bestows upon it's listeners…and also the snare.
Bunk is ALL about the head-nod. Head-nodding is to Bunk what head-banging is to Grunge. Driven by a smashing
Punchy kicks on the downbeat and aggressive 80's-style gated-reverb snares on the upbeat provide rhythm to syncopated basslines

  Keywords: Flow, highly danceable and crisp production (lo-fi has no place in this genre).

  Producer's checklist:

  Overall funk-aesthetic

  Four-To-The-Floor beat

  80's-style gated-reverb snare

  Rhythmic micro-silences

  Syncopated instrumentation

  Unconventional percussion sounds.

*No Reggaeton 'Dem Bow'-style beats

Would anyone be interested in participating in a monthly/bimonthly sample pack challenge? 

Stealing the idea from dubstepforum, stretch, mangle the shit out of, and toss them back in a sampler if you want. Any kind of processing is fine &amp; no genre restrictions, but absolutely no other samples can be used. Winners would be voted on by the community with the winner supplying the next sample pack.


I've taken part in a few things like this and it's a really fun and challenging way to produce music. Sometimes the packs are super limited and the samples can be really random. The limitations actually seem to fuel creativity &amp; experimentation since you're out of your usual samples/synths comfort zone. Also

From that time on the process became pretty simple. I'd wait for David to complete a new draft of the master

[flairbot's back up](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/wirnb/update_on_the_flairbot/)

---

We have that whole nifty flairbot guy who's been feeling sick for some time now. he's written in python 2. Unfortunately I cannot give out the source code because it's not mine and the person who wrote it made me promise never to hand it out. He also hasn't been around in a while.

He managed to convince /r/furry to give us their flairbot's source. The problem is it's written in Python 3. Our programmer didn't know Python 3 and was too busy with his own stuff to learn it to adapt theirs to our needs. 

So that's where you, you're welcome to, but you're also welcome to write it in C or whatever. We do, however, have a few specifications that you need to meet.

* The flairbot must use the [Reddit API](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)

* We need to be able to specify the username/password that signs into the flairbot. When it signs in

* The flairbot should check its mail periodically. The time period should be easily changed via some sort of terminal command

* The flairbot must be able to recognize soundcloud links. I believe our programmer used a regex that recognized ""soundcloud.com/"" and grabbed that and everything after it until it found white space. Ignore http:// and www. to make it short. This needs to be placed in the text portion of the flair when the request is sent to reddit.

* The flairbot must be able to recognize genres. This should be done with a string to string map. The 'key' being strings we find in the message and the 'value' being the name of the flair class. So for instance, ""d&amp;b"" maps to ""dnb"", etc. These should be case-insensitive. Our CSS flair classes are called, for instance, sc-dnb. So, the value of this map should be specified in the 'class' portion of the flair as ""sc-""+value. We can talk more about our flair class names once you begin.

* The flairbot should message a user when it's successfully flaired someone

* If the computer the flairbot is running on looses internet

(Zippyshare's processing of the wav file for streaming also blends the higher frequencies and makes it sounds like there's a phaser on the bassline channel.)

All of the effects units I used were Logic native except two ([Bad Buss

Since I'm really not a proponent of the ""copy my patch setting for setting"" aspect of the Youtube tutorial culture (it doesn't teach you nearly as much as experimentation and thought process do)

Finally, but allow you to experiment with how overloading the distortion unit with specific harmonics changes the sound. 

Now, most Youtube tutorials lead you to believe. So if you listen to the sound in the song, you can clearly hear that there are two elements: a darker, distorted bassline in mostly mono and a brighter supersaw in mostly stereo. I tackled the latter top end first.
 
The top end is a distinctly wide, which occurs when you use less voices and less detuning among them. For this one, I had two saws with three voices each and the detune setting set just below half (just enough that the [beat frequency](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/beat.html) was low enough to be unnoticeable) with stereo all the way up. For the sake of complexity and added thickness, I set the detune setting a bit higher and the volume a bit lower on one of the oscillators. Then, I applied a soft Decimator to give it the high-end ring and a bit of chorus to smooth it out with a low enough ""wet"" setting to keep the crispiness of the unprocessed sound. I knew that I'd apply distortion to the sound, but I wanted it to have similar settings to the other sound (the one the distortion would really define) for the sake of cohesiveness so I cut the lows and left it there for now.

Then, set the stereo settings to zero, and experimented with different waveforms in different octaves to get the heavier bassline. When making basslines, remember that the initial texture of the sound relied not only on your waveforms but the relationships between them--for example, a square an octave lower than a saw will give you different phase alignment and different texture than a saw an octave lower than a square. In this case, I stumbled upon using one of the three-voice supersaws with a raw square an octave below it. I set the volumes so that it sounded as much like the real thing as possible, then I got to processing. I cut out the sub and high (Above ~10kish, and applied a waveshaper. I messed with the settings on 100% Wet and put a boost onto the EQ going into the waveshaper between 100 and 200Hz to overload it in those frequencies a bit

I then copied the waveshaper and bitcrusher settings to the top end and bussed them together. I made copies of the track for each individual wobble and stab. On the buss, 20dB) to bring the harmonics to a closer level (Theoretically, it just changes the volume, but when the compression is that heavy it allows the quieter harmonics to shine through a bit), ""gelling"" the sound in other words. LFOTool for the sidechain, and the sound was done.

One note: a lot of the ""beef"" of the loop on a whole comes from the long tail of the kick. I just sampled the kick and snare from the original song.

* [Lesson 2 - Melody](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/v9a58/lesson_2_melody_level_beginner_to_some_experience/)

So for this lesson I orginally wanted to just show you guys what goes into making a good trance lead but that's a completely varied topic. As in

My example song has different plucks so I think it's perfect in this case. If you're curious what VST I'm using

The first example I'm going with is the more drawn-out pluck. 

****

There's a few things you should know before getting your hands ""dirty."" 

* Keep plucks short. The longer you stretch it

* Use your delay FX. The delays your VST comes with are great but for that real nice pluck effect I suggest you also use the Fruity Delay 2 or Delay Bank. (You can use it instead of the VST's, this is your music you're making, not mine.

* When making the VST

Now

To get started, OSC2, Freq, Detune, Mod Env, Release, etc. Those are random words, but that's for the beginners out there who don't know what those mean. This tutorial is not for you. There's great tutorials on r/edm for that

To make it easier to understand

You can notice quite a few things here - what knobs I actually use and don't. The important two things when first making it is the frequency cutoff and the mod envelope in the filter section. The mod envelope essentially is how hard or soft you want your pluck to hit (in this case). The freq cutoff is how short or long you want the pluck to play. There's other factors in play here but after I first make the synth those two knobs are the ones I tweak the most to get the exact feel I'm wanting. 

****

The other pluck I'm going to discuss here is short plucks. There is a such thing as **too short** and it's ultimately up to your own taste. There's always room for exploring but if you make your plucks too short it can ruin your whole song (other things can do this as well

What differs from the pluck above is hw you want to approach it. It's not just the synth you make but the notes as well. I've already said you should have your pluck melody (or what you originally want as your pluck melody) in the VST before you make it. If you can't envision it before you make the sound I suggest you use a preset. Sure

Specifically to the synth itself

****

To wrap this up

Now you've (hopefully) read three lessons. What would you like next? The next two topics I have in mind are **organizing your tracks** and **EQing your track (for beginners).** If you've got a suggestion, not to argue on the internet about what I do right or wrong.

Thanks for reading!

So, but I'll put em down anyway for good measure...


1. When submitting to multiple labels, this makes it come across as spamming and does not make me feel special...


2. The title of your email. Try making your submission look as professional as possible


3. Send whole, but you'd be amazed by the amount of 1m34 tracks we get.


4. Send 1 song. Send your best song


5. This one goes especially for the electro/dance/edm style that's the most popular at the moment. Don't let this stop you from experimenting, between those there are usually 2 drops, and it should all happen in about 5 minutes time. Now once again, there are exceptions, think 'Karmameter' and 'Metropolis', but if your song has 6 different parts and lasts 8min, it has to be really really impressive, sorry...


6. Mastering is important, I've noticed the ones that don't 'look' mastered usually sound amateurish. And by 'it doesn't look mastered' I mean when I open the soundcloud page and your song's wave form looks like it's malnourished.


7. This is where it's no longer a matter of not acting retarded and giving your email a normal title, so much people looking to get their record out, you get to be real picky. Compare your sound to your favorite artists, A-B the shit out of your song, it needs to be as good as the current #1 on beatport. It's hard to really give advice here, some people just have it and others don't. Some people need to practice for 10 years and others become successful after 1 year of producing. Aside from that, you need to be really critical of your work



That's everything I can think of for now, but now that I know what it's like to receive so much music on a daily basis, I understand why labels can come across as assholes. The amount of emails is almost like they're spamming us, now that wouldn't be bad if the quality was there, but it's like 90% of the people make their first song in Magix Music Maker and send it to us for feedback...

*The graphic illustrates what the following describes* 

Picture hearing sound in a box that encloses your head. That box is a song

By balancing combinations of the levels of volume, and pitch/equalizer freq, you can effectively ""place"" instruments into particular regions of the box. First, I will explain what each parameter does:

**Volume** - Raising the volume of a track within a song production (an instrument if you prefer) can bring the sound to prominence. Basically

**Pan** - The pan is simply the balance of the volume of the sound between two stereo speakers. Move the slider 100% L and the sound only comes from the left speaker; 100% R will result in the sound coming only form the right speaker. 

**Reverb/Delay** - Reverb provides the feeling of space. The size and character of the reverb (long fading or slow fading release) can essentially create the dimensions of the box. A longer fading reverb will make the box space seem bigger, and a long delay (where the sound echoes long after the original) provides the feeling of a larger space. The Dimension Expander effect in Massive is more or less a short delay.

**Pitch/EQ Freq.** - This parameter is of some debate but most speaker setups will have lower frequency speakers down low and high frequency speakers at the top. At a club, and the tweeters are generally on the top-side of the linear reference monitor on your desktop (unless you are one of those people who likes to turn them sideways).

Regardless, I somehow almost always envision some sort of space wrapped around me, almost like a small or large room, where the sound of each of the instruments has its own place in the space. Different genres of music have different styles of using the space but nonetheless, there is a space created.

A few weeks ago someone [requested a music production class](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/n5x3g/request_music_production_classes/) on [/r/UniversityofReddit](/r/UniversityofReddit)

The plan is to build a curriculum around a set of screencasted lessons I'll be recording over the coming weeks and months. These lessons will be in 1080p and freely available forever on the Youtubez. They will start with the very basics of audio production -- like the fundamentals of synthesis -- and progress on to more advanced topics like tool use (with a focus on Ableton Live), the use of EQ and compression and other effects, mixing, and mastering.

Here's where I need your help in answering a couple questions that will help me build the best curriculum for you:

1. What topics are of the most interest to you? Which topics do you struggle with or wish you could better understand? What do you most want to learn?
2. How would you classify your general level of competency? ""I just installed a DAW and I'm SO EXCITE!"", and so on.

My goal is to create and build upon a solid foundation of applicable theory to help you understand both the ""how"" and the ""*why*"" of electronic music production -- and to give you a lot of quick wins along the way -- to help you learn and progress as artists.

I'm currently working on the first lesson, a warm pad, or a totally sweet reece bassline.

Here's [a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Hd8J4.jpg) of me building the all-mighty saw wave using additive synthesis to give you guys some idea of what to expect from the screencasts.

The word ""Producer"" in the most modern context:

Why do we use that word? I can honestly describe that word as TOXIC to the music scene. 

There is a clear seperation in the minds of many young artists

Now, people are content with ""producing"" house, dubstep, trance, whateverfuckinggenre. What does that mean? Sticking to convention many times, repeating things they hear others in the same genre do, maintaining the status quo except with a little ""flavor"" thrown in there. We have the internet literally FLOODED with this generic mainly electronic music because the technology is so accessible. People see a foray into ""production"" as ""musician lite"" (regardless of how flawed a misconception)

""But everyone starts out bad... etc."" 

Sure

Remember Burial? Mount Kimbie? Aphex Twin? Flying Lotus?

Those people all took something that did exist, and all of Aphex Twin's albums with my MOTHER who does not under any circumstances listen to EDM as such. Yet, that music could speak to her even being from outside the scene, it could stand on it's own. Could the same be said about the beeps and bops over a 4/4 kick track that you might be producing today? Probably not. 

""most producers don't aspire to just copy""

But they don't aspire to eschew the WHOLE paradigm of music either. OBVIOUSLY music and inspiration come from somewhere. EDM, House all existed and if you were to classify them, those albums would fit under a genre of sorts. But they CHALLENGED the norms.

I feel often the root cause of this is that we do not see ourselves as ASPIRING MUSICIANS (which we should) rather PRODUCAZ on the internet. 

Fuck that word, forget everything, get YOUR OWN MESSAGE, YOUR OWN FEELING OUT THERE.



TL:DR : The word ""producer"" and the label attached to it

Thanks to college_loner for the request (and for my first ever reddit gold)!

[Here's a demo of the successive steps I took in moving towards Zedd's bass.](https://soundcloud.com/mark-henry/synth-recipe-8-demo/s-KbY2c) Even the last version is not a perfect imitation. Not only is there necessarily a lot of randomness and tweaking in the design of this sound, that Zedd created it with FM synthesis.

Today's recipe is kind of an experiment in a variation on the Synth Recipes formula. You shouldn't expect to duplicate the sound exactly. I'll be giving you a starting point and a bunch of heuristic pointers on what to tweak

[Here's a MIDI file of the riff from ""Breakin' A Sweat.""](http://www.mediafire.com/?uw7rfcb9ud7umxc) Now open up your favorite DAW and let's get started.

**The Key**

Sonically speaking, I think it's likely that FM synthesis was used to create the basic waveform. That's what we'll be using today.

**Ingredients**

* One FM synth that lets you adjust individual harmonics. Operator and Oatmeal let you do this. [So does Sytrus!](http://i.imgur.com/M0ptO.png) (twice edited)

* RoughRider or a tube saturator. I got good results with RoughRider in combination with iZotope Ozone's harmonic exciter module.

**Get Cooking**

1. Set up your FM synth really simple: one carrier and one modulator. A second modulator will tend to make things a little too fuzzy

2. Start by listening to just the carrier. Tweak it until it sounds reasonably close to the finished product. This makes for a good place to start. Now for some exploration.

3. Set the modulator to a rather darker waveform

4. Now it's a matter of playing with the following settings: modulator level, making lower notes brighter than higher ones or vice versa.) FM is an unbelievably finicky beast, and small changes will make a large difference in the timbre of the sound output. But try to make small, controlled changes and you'll start to see patterns.
 1. Keep an eye on the waveform shape as you mess with the partials. Sometimes drastic changes in the partials will result in very little change in the waveform shape and the sound.
 3. As you turn on more and more partials, low band of partials, with a couple of subtle high harmonics for flavor.
 2. Turning up an isolated band of partials in the modulator will make a distinct vocalish-resonant kind of sound.

5. **Every time you arrive at a sound that makes you say ""hey, then continue working. This will leave a handy trail of breadcrumbs as you traverse the space of all possible FM configurations. Keep iterating like this until you feel you're done.

**Garnish**

The most important thing to get done now is to deeply sidechain to a punchy kick drum. A little EQing will finish the job.

Different types and quantities of distortion will do wonderful things to this sound. Other things to try include modulating the FM amount or putting decay on the modulator

This bass is just begging to be resampled. Whether you’re familiar with the resampling process or you need an excuse to play with it for the first time

**Serve Directly To The Forehead**

Any questions? Please share what you made from this recipe in the comments. What sound would you like to hear in upcoming episodes?

Solution?

get yourself some of those glass beads that you often find used in vases for flower arrangements.   (They need to be flat(ish) on one side and round on the other.  Place three of these under your monitor in a triangle shape (3 is better than 4 - less surface area) with the round side down.  you'll need to experiment a bit to find the most stable placement for your setup.

* Check your arrogance at the door.

* ONLY post songs that are a work in progress (WIP).

* Please include a genre tag in your title. Examples: [DnB], etc.

* Please have a specific question in mind, the last measure comes off a little cheesy, any ideas?"" etc.

* Please make an effort to comment on others' questions. Even if you can't give any production tips, please be as descriptive in your opinion, and hence as helpful as possible.

* Courtesy and respect. Like for real. We are NOT a group of elitists and this sort of attitude will not be tolerated. ""This is not dubstep"" ""shutup hipster"" ""i hate all these rusko fanboys"" type posts should be downvoted and ignored. Please report these.

Posts that are NOT for this subreddit:

* Listen to this Deadmau5 track!

* Check out my new toy! [picture of your new shiny moog]

I'm not happy with my progress, but it feels more like trial and error than anything else.  I want to learn the theory behind programming drum patterns.

I'll take a quick diversion to point out a lot of ways that resources online seem to talk about it.  Half of it is people talking about being drummers, and doesn't explain the theory.  There are a lot of resources on music theory, I wouldn't expect to learn chords, harmony or something like that through similar trial and error.

So what are good resources for the **theory** of percussion and programming it into a pattern.  How to structure a breakbeat.  How to use volume to accentuate beats over others.  How to make a groove or backbeat.  What sort of patterns to use on the percussion/hi-hats/etc, but I want to learn all the theory of it, from a drum pattern programming standpoint.

Now, but hey, that's how you learn, right?

What I've done is create 6 different EQ channels each for a particular instrument. I set a frequency range  that pertains to a specific characteristic such as clarity, etc., and mapped that to a macro control on an audio rack. I also mapped gains to macro controls so you can either boost or cut out said characteristics.

I've tested these eq channels on several of my instruments and patches, etc. Again, I could totally be going about this the wrong way, but I'm willing to make myself look like an ass if that means I'll learn more. =P

How it could work:

We could either all post a few of the mini demos with the melody or the basis of the started track on sound cloud

1333819630.0,ry1xg,"AMAZING tip for Logic users, ""Selective Bandwidth Ducking"", sidechain specific frequencies!",kangaroocoffee,37,15

&gt;So here's the typical problem. A bunch of noisy guitars driving along and you want to inject an acoustic guitar or vocal lead in there once in a while. But you can't get the track hot enough or eq'd enough to overcome the noisy guitars. Ducking the guitars with either automation or a sidechained compressor might be too noticable

1. This is a mix technique and we'll be assigning plugs to auxes

2. Assign your noisy guitar tracks to a bus. We'll use bus 10 as in my example. 

3. Assign your lead track to your main outputs. Create a Send on this track to bus 11 and set its level to unity

4. Create 2 new aux channels. Assign both their inputs to Bus 10

5. Don't put any plugs on the first aux. On the second aux, then a Gain plug. 

6. Set the EQ up with a Lopass and a Hipass only

7. Set the Noise Gate as follows. 
Threshold &amp; Reduction: -100dB 
Attack
Hysteresis: -20dB 
Lookahead: 20.000mS 
Sidechain: Bus 11 

8. Open the Gain plug and enable Phase Invert(s). Close the Gain plug. 


&gt;Here's what's happening in my example. When the acoustic guitar plays, I want to hear more of the body of the acoustic guitar which is about 225 to 1300 Hz so that's what I've set the EQ to pass. So now everything below and above that band won't be canceled. If I drop the fader down on the second aux, then the signal isn't cancelled as much. 

&gt;When the acoustic plays

&gt;You have a lot of control as you can tweak the reversed aux's fader for the amount of ducking and tweak the lo and hi pass freq parameters on the EQ to tune the band that gets ducked.

* Imagine how your song would fit in a set and mix with it
* Think of the track(s) you would like your's to sound like and compare your mixdown and mastering to it. Make sure to pick out where the individual parts fit frequency-wise!
* Listen to your track on every thing you can, laptop speakers, regular headphones, car stereo...
* If you have a sound you processed, threw effects on, and it **still** feels off, just ditch it! You can always cannibalize the MIDI and/or patch and reapply it somewhere else.

1367564569.0,1dlv2k,Free Yamaha Grand Piano Instrument for Kontakt 5,Syrou,42,12,12,"**What is this?**

I've created an instrument for Kontakt 5 featuring the Yamaha Grand Piano from the CX-series.

The instrument should work for Kontakt 5 Player (which is free) so there is nothing stopping you from trying this one out.

**Why free?**

For this to be able to reach comercial status, which it does not. It also does not have manual velocity recorded for each note, but rather recreated with volume inside Kontakt.

The instrument does recreate the pitch accuratly

It was only recorded with one long sample

**Can I use this in my productions?**

Even though it is free, it does sound good enough to use in productions. You are also free to use these samples or instruments in your productions, as long as you put my name as the creator of the package, recordings and instrument creation, and do not claim it to be your own. You can find the details in the readme.txt that follows with the piano.zip file.

It might be a nice change to use this

**Will there be a comercial follow up on this?**

The plan at a later point

**Where do I get it?**

**Who is the Creator?**

1362665409.0,19ufcr,#5 Genre Competition,genrecompetition,35,4,48,"The following genre is select by edwinrosero winning with the track: http://soundcloud.com/edwinrosero/etiamunda


**Genre:** *Postremo*

**Tempo:** *Prestissimo

**Time signature:** *3/4, 6/8, 7/8, 17/8*

**Instrumentation:**

Synthetic and Natural percussion representing a wide variety of percussive timbres. Speedy Synths with nearly constantly changing timbres Characteristics:

Recent experiments at a theoretical physics laboratory in the United States have uncovered what appears to be coded audio data from an unknown origin. There is speculation that the messages are from a parallel universe or perhaps from a future point in our timeline. Based on signal analysis

Most blocks or “songs” span from 180 to 200 seconds. There is most always a decrease of data halfway through the song

Another feature common with all of the data is an ever changing compositional structure such that no two sections are Identical. No two measures/bars^1 are exactly the same with bars/measures towards the end of the compositions being much different than those at the start.  Time signatures may or may not vary.

Further analysis has shown that this music is based on the Prometheus Scale^2. The reasons for this remains unknown.)

http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1jh68a/xpost_from_relectrohouse_producers_of_reddit_i/

On **August 15th at 4PM Los Angeles time** I will submit a new post where I go through your tracks and productions and give you feedback and critique on how to improve them.

I'll be giving up a days work to do this so I ask if you can all be kind enough to help make it as orderly as possible by following the following guidelines

- No more than 2 tracks per person
- If you have a specific question i.e. ""How to i make the bass not clash with the kick"" that will help get a more useful response from me
- Don't OVERDO the master channel
- If you are uncomfortable posting your track in public
- Make sure your track is labelled well and there's some contact information.. If I hear a bloody amazing track
- If you post soundcloud links and they are secret



**EDIT: Sorry about the title of this post alluding to the critiquing session being a week away. For clarification it will be on August 15th
