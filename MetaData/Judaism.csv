I walked down the 45 blocks, and the mostly elderly members were under blankets. But, after we it candles, we started the psalms and everything started to feel normal.

Around the 4th verse of L'cha Dodi, all the lights came on!

The cantor kept up the song as we started a hora dance. There were only maybe 25 people there - but everyone was smiling. One woman was crying she was so happy.

1) No editorializing titles of article submissions. - This is up for discussion.

2) Be polite. That means if somebody has a disagreement with you about fundamental points of religion, but don't be a jerk about it. Do not shut down the conversation. 

2.1) I keep on trying to engage non-Orthodox Jews of Reddit. Seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/we84t/followup_question/), does not make it less of a problem.  Non-Orthodox Jews are feeling shut down, and some times they are right, some times they are wrong. This is an extension of rule two. Be polite. The downvote button IS NOT a ""I disagree"" button. I might just remove it again, and for more than a day.

To people I try and engage

 But why is he going to the Steinbergs in Samvet? The Steinbergs have only daughters, then which daughter did he marry? They say that Sarah Steinberg married a nice lawyer from Budapest, and Esther married a businessman from Zhitomer, so it must be Sarah's husband.

I essentially consider myself humanistic, and my wife grew up reform so we settled on that. 

While I wish I could post the entire sermon


The rabbi was talking about how, and had probably thousands of recipes, hundreds of which were well known to the family. 

As the rabbi sorted through all of it, and some lines were crossed out or amounts altered. 

Still others were hand written recipes written by her great grandmother

And the rabbi began to wonder: At what point does it stay ""the family recipe"" and when does it become something else? If you make great Great Grandma's kugel the way that it was written by great great grandma

But do you WANT to make the kugel the original way? Maybe you try it and you like it

Contrawise, and find you actually like it much better that way. Is it still Nana's brisket, or is it yours? Do you have the RIGHT to change Nana's brisket?


The rabbi decided, we each shape the things we pass on a little bit. Even though some people may feel that they have no right to change things, it happens naturally to adapt our ""recipes"" to what is best at the time. 



Now

Also, but my general feeling is that most people believe that some of the events in the Torah happened, some didn't, and some happened but not quite exactly how they're described. The Torah is (by many acounts) a book of laws written (possibly with divine influence) to help people be more moral, just, ethical, and all of the other positive words about human behavior.

A random guy goes to a Chabad rabbi and asks him why he's comfortable with so many people driving to his shul on Shabbat.

Chabad rabbi: What are you talking about?

Random guy: Aren't you aware of all the people that are driving here?

Chabad rabbi: I have no idea what you're talking about. No one drove into the shul. Every person who came here walked in through the door. How they got to that point is their own business.

The point of me telling this story is that people come to this subreddit to discuss Jewish things and to learn Jewish things. What people do outside of that is their own business and people shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable because of their level of observance.

I stopped in front of a row of benches to listen to an older gentleman playing the saxophone.  An elderly lady sitting nearby struck up a conversation with me and we discussed jazz and the nice weather.  Then the saxophonist stopped and started speaking to me

Then another older gentleman walked up and requested St James Infirmary.  I had never heard it on the saxophone, wouldn't you know it?  And had I seen him live?  Of course, I'd seen him at Vaughn's several times (the bar he co-owns).  

Well this entire conversation went on for 15-20 minutes and it was super awesome.  And then

I began to excuse myself because I really did want to go out seeking a job.  And then something happened that hasn't happened in at least 4 years now.

They all wished me Shabbat Shalom in turn.  My voice caught in my throat.  I thought I would cry.  I haven't heard someone say that in person in so long.  I told them that they'd made my Pesach and I wished them Shabbat Shalom and I wandered on my way.

There's actually an epilogue to this little tale

When I got off of the train at my stop on my way back home later

She asked why I would offer to carry her things, I said that I wanted the conversation.  She looked around and up at me, I stand at least 18 inches taller than her, and she said she understood that.  Her husband died having his afternoon tea 6 weeks ago, and she'd been lonely ever since with no one to speak with.  

We carried on several blocks to her bus station

I have to think that having my hair fixed up nice, any more.  Just the old folks are here now, and a few poorer Jews.  Everyone else has moved half an hour west.

I suppose the older folks get lonely

:)

I will be making an effort from now on to be every bit as approachable - and kippah-wearing (whatever I've been warned against it here) - because it's what I should do

1354131619.0,13y6g8,"[UPDATE] For those who care, I am that Jewish student who wore Tzitzit for a project for a week. Here is my reflection paper, some had asked to see it when it's written. ",optometry_j3w1993,39,38

For my extra credit assignment I took on the mitzvah of wearing tzitzit for a week straight. I began the night before Yom Kippur, I am not the most observant Jew in the world, however I feel that I observe more than other secular Jews that are my peers. I try to keep kosher, and put on Tefillin every morning.  I had for years been curious about wearing tzitzit, what they actually mean, and what it would feel like to wear a part of the traditional Jewish wardrobe. The first day I wore it, was Yom Kippur. I had always kept the holiday holy by fasting and praying with my father at home, however now the feeling lasted all day. It was a whole new experience for me. When I returned to classes while wearing the tzitzit I was surprised by the looks I was receiving in my direction. I noticed many people would stop and just look at the strings hanging from my shirt. At times I felt judged by others, had a kippah on my head


My most telling incident however was on the basketball courts. I frequent them quite often to play the sport I love, because I am decently good at basketball. However, I went to play and decided to keep the tzitzit on, as this project for me slowly turned into a social experiment versus simply keeping the mitzvah alone. I was not offered to be on a team as I usually am used to and to work harder to “earn” my spot. I even overheard some of the students whisper, “are we sure we want this Jew to play?” I have always been very proud of my Jewish identity however, and am not ashamed for the world to know I’m a carrier of Jewish blood. Quite on the contrary, I always wear my large Star of David around my neck so that people know that I am a Jew. However, to becoming a Jew. I had heard about this distinction in the eyes of the gentiles before
As the week came to a close I had a lot to reflect on. How the others looks and judgments made me feel, for now. I need to elaborate on this point, however. 


When wearing tzitzit, I feel like while wearing tzitzit I should reflect the ideals of practices of traditional Judaism. A casual everyday sinner as myself should not be wearing them as to not deceive the public into thinking something that I do is acceptable in the eyes of mainstream Judaism. Perhaps one day I will feel the pull to wear them all the time and to live my life in accordance with Torah law, however now is not that time for me as an individual.

Dear Friends
I am writing about a very urgent matter.

Harvey Paretzky
He cannot survive long-term without a transplant. Saving a person's life is a great mitzvah. By donating a kidney

Harvey is working with Renewal, and meet certain other specific criteria, you will be a potential donor.

For additional information
R612@renewal.org
(718) 431-9831
This letter was sent with Harvey's approval.
Rabbi Yaakov Luban

Renewal Fact Sheet

WHO CAN BE A DONOR?
Donors need to be between the ages of 18 and early 70's and can include family and friends or even an altruistic donor. An ideal donor should have compatible blood type with the recipient.
Typically, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, HIV or hepatitis C will not qualify to be a donor, but are not automatically ruled out.

WHAT ARE THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A DONOR?
The risks of donation are similar to those involved with any major surgery

HOW IS IT DETERMINED IF A PROSPECTIVE DONOR'S KIDNEY IS A GOOD MATCH?
Matching donor kidney to recipients is based entirely upon blood group compatibility and antigen matching, blood types must also be compatible. The most common blood type is O, which is present in fifty percent of the population. Even if the donor isn't a match directly to the recipient, it can still benefit the recipient through a swap. More on swaps later.
Tissue matching and more advanced Luminex testing between the donor and the recipient is done by the hospital to determine compatibility between a donor and recipient. These tests of compatibility are also performed to identify the presence of any antibodies that would cause rejection from that specific donor. All this is accomplished by blood tests.

HOW IS LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY PERFORMED?
During the surgery
For precautionary reasons

WHAT AFFECTS WILL SURGERY HAVE ON DONOR?
You may feel tired for the first week or two after the surgery and are encouraged to rest and limit your activities during this period. You should not lift anything that weighs more that 20 lbs for the first four-six weeks. You may also have some swelling around the incision area and should plan to wear loose

WHAT KIND OF FOLLOW-UP IS NEEDED?
You will have a post-operative appointment with your surgeon 1-2 weeks after the surgery. Additional follow-up appointments will be scheduled 6 months

WHO PAYS FOR THE MEDICAL COSTS?
All expenses of testing required for the living donor evaluation as well as the hospitalization costs and physician services provided during the donation process are covered either by recipient's insurance or Medicare.

WHAT ABOUT MY OTHER EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE?
All non-medical expenses such as lost wages

IF I WISH TO BE A KIDNEY DONOR
A prospective donor should contact Renewal who
Once it has been determined that the potential donor and recipient are compatible
In general

IS A DONOR MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP KIDNEY DISEASE OR MEDICAL PROBLEMS LATER IN LIFE?
The answer is no. Donors are not more likely to experience kidney disease or medical problems than the general population.

THE EFFECTS ON LIFE SPAN OF DONORS
Potential kidney donors do not need to worry about the long-term effects such a donation might have on their health and longevity.
A recent report published in the New England Journal of Medicine analyzed the outcome for nearly 3
""We're hoping that these results will make the decision to donate easier for people and alleviate anxiety about living with one kidney

The Messiah will do many things.

&gt;The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. Isaiah 2:11-17

Currently does not happen.

&gt;Knowledge of God will fill the world. Isaiah 11:9, Jeremiah 31:33, Zechariah 3:9, 8:23, 14:9,16, Ezekiel 38:23

This means irrefutable evidence.  Knowledge

&gt;All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12, 36:24, Deuteronomy 30:3

I am still in America.

&gt;The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. Isaiah 51:11

Holocaust?  Inquisition?  Progroms?

&gt;Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel. Isaiah 52:13-53:5

Holocaust deniers

&gt;The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. Zechariah 8:23

Spiritual

&gt;Weapons of war will be destroyed. Ezekiel 39:9

Not destroyed by nuclear weapons.

&gt;All of the dead will rise again Isaiah 26:19

You claim one dude

&gt;A person’s genealogical/tribal membership are transmitted exclusively through one’s physical father. Numbers 1:18

Jesus whose alleged sketchy genealogy is maternal cannot possibly be a descendent of the tribe of Judah

&gt;Third Temple will be rebuilt. Micah 4:1, Malachi 3:4, Zechariah 14:20-21,

Not a person

&gt;World Peace: Isaiah 2:4, Hosea 2:20

Open a newspaper lately? 

&gt;Christianity claims that Jesus ""Fulfilled the law""

According to Deut 13:2-7

&gt;All Jews will embrace Torah observance. Ezekiel 37:24, Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27.

How many Jews are fully observant today?

&gt;The Messiah can not be part God. Deut 6:4

Not explicitly Jesus

The Messiah will be a warrior king.  He will be a human, who was thought to be the Messiah.  [Once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb), the Rabbis shrugged and said ""I guess it was not him"".  So the Messiah must be alive in order to fulfill the prophecies.

1366849712.0,1d1rfx,Long Bus Ride...,shamy33,32,5,16,"Went to the dentist earlier today. On my bus ride home I was graced with the classic ""shalom"". I was like ""oh great... Another random that knows 2 Hebrew words"". Turns out it was a guy

He started off telling me that his mother was Jewish &amp; that we were ""brothers"". He is a believer in the second testimont(Christ). I told him I was orthodox - that's where the fun began.  

The first thing that he questioned was how us orthodox know/are certain that God hears us/listens. I started explaining to him we believe &amp; have 100%faith/trust (I need a better response for next time). I retaliated with ""how do YOU guys know that God responds?"". He went on about how he hears voices or a 'voice' (which just made me suggest a mental home/asylum). He followed up with claiming a ""conscious feeling told him so"" which I once again asked if he needed to see a doctor for these voices.


The next point he brought in was how we disagree with the exact text of the original testimont. I had to bring in gemarah for this - *sigh* . They never quite seem to understand that.(this guy did understand it a bit)

Following up was my attempt to go on the offense - I asked him the classic: ""You do agree that the old testimont was given in front of the entire Jewish people?"". It took me a bit to get him to admit that he agreed - that's when I went for the kill. ""If you agree God spoke to all the Jewish people the first time around

1344462399.0,xwkjk,Why I'm thinking about walking away from r/judaism.,sweetjackmccry,39,9,194,"Hi everyone. Rather than keep it to myself or slip away quietly

Let me start with my bona fides. Not to toot my own horn, is the job of a rabbi. I spent many years in conversion classes, college, and finally in rabbinical school learning the intricacies of topics that most of the world hasn’t even heard of. Now, some of you might know that the plight of the rabbi in the modern rabbinate is that we sit around waiting to give answers but no one is actually asking us questions. That is an exaggeration of course, but there is some truth to it. So when I stumbled across r/judaism and saw people actually asking questions, I took it as a godsend.

So I jumped in and started answering questions, and of course I can’t rely on strangers to just take my word for it. And in an ideal world, wouldn’t everyone be asking for the sources so that we could all learn the relevant psukim and sugiyot together? So I tried to clamp down on my rabbi-sized ego and answer to the best of my ability.

But there’s a problem. I may be an expert but I’m not an encyclopedia. These are things I have gleaned over the course of a lifetime and I usually don’t remember page numbers. Always being asked to provide the source was taking precious 30-minute blocks out of my day as I scanned dapim and tried to hunt on Google for the Gemara I studied many many years ago.

What’s more, because I was reading the source with my Conservative lens while many others were reading it with an Orthodox lens. Soon we were arguing not about the question or the source but about how we read a text. These are fundamental issues and they demand respect from everyone involved. Nobody on r/judaism is stupid and we are all deserving of respect for our fundamental convictions. I am not interested in telling anyone to walk away from their Orthodox viewpoint and I would never call it ill-informed. Of course I would appreciate the same courtesy. I am tired of the rush of adrenaline which comes every time I see the red envelope. I just don’t have the time or the inclination to constantly defend Conservative Judaism or my own eclectic viewpoint every single time I open my mouth.

So that’s where I am today. I see people asking questions and I would like to offer my perspective but I don’t have the free time or the patience to deal with the back-and-forth that will inevitably occur. The result seems likely to be either that the Conservative position will go undefended or it will go unoffered. I am hopeful that there is another alternative

**Boca Raton

Jon's Place (dairy, sandwiches, salads, wraps.  Known for pizza though, it was for a time the only game in town.  Internationally famous, apparently.  ORB kosher supervision.

Avigdor's Mozart Café (dairy, Israeli.  Open late, and the one in Hollywood is (locally) famously open 24/6.  ORB.

Euro Fusion (dairy, Greek, Israeli, pizza.  Expect the extremely friendly owners to come and sit down with you and strike up a conversation.  ORB.

Boca Pita Express (glatt):  Israeli, the General Tso's chicken, and the Cajun burger, respectively.  ORB.

18th Street Deli (glatt):  NYC-style deli.  Newer establishment by the owners of Euro Fusion (which is next door).  Excellent overstuffed sandwiches and a dozen different kinds of sausages

Fran's Chicken Haven (glatt):  Southern-style fried chicken.  Open since 1964, just got rid of the treif menu items.  Good lunch specials and reasonably priced.  ORB.

Sagi's Mediterranean Grill (glatt):  Israeli.  Formerly known as Falafel Armon, just about the best in town.  Has been open for Pesach in the past, not sure if he's doing it again this year.  ORB.

Orchid Garden (glatt):  High-end Chinese.  This place has been there forever, entree, dessert), but it's worth it.  Expect Eli, the owner, to drop by your table personally at least twice to offer kind words.  ORB.

Grill Time (glatt):  High-end fusion steakhouse.  Nice place

Asia (glatt): Chinese, very pricey, service tends to be a bit slow because it's usually packed.  Sometimes open for Pesach with an alternate menu - *not kitniyos safe*.  ORB.

Marcus's Kosher Chinese (glatt):  Less-expensive Chinese.  Relatively new place, though they may have changed recipes since I was there, which was only the once (it's not in my neighborhood).  ORB.

JCC Café (dairy

Aside from all of these, for dairy stuff, cholov yisroel) bakery and the pas yisroel (but for dairy, *not* cholov yisroel) bakery in one of the local supermarkets, and off the top of my head, six or seven ice cream/gelato/frozen yogurt shops.  Just about all ORB, except for Amazing Savings which is under KM

I'm also probably totally forgetting some other kosher restaurants

I took off my headphones and heard him singing very passionately. It sounded like Hebrew but it wasn't anything I recognized, is very inappropriate. 

I didn't realize what I was getting into at this point and was just curious. I waited for him to stop singing so I could talk to him and check out his pamphlets. And of course the pamphlet was for Jews for Jesus (it was weird and had Justin Bieber on it). I could have left right then (and should have!) but I kind of wanted to engage with him and see what would say despite the fact that I was almost late for class. I am not a smart man before 11:00 AM. 

He was very personable and friendly. He went through the whole Jesus died for us spiel and also kept dropping Hebrew words to prove that he was legit as a Jew, it's not really about an organization, it's a very individual decision, etc."" Yeah, right. He also kind of twisted Shavuot into being about Jesus as well (ie, that the messianic prophecies were given to us within the Torah, as the important thing.....hmmm). 

But I was still trying to be nice to him because I did not have the energy or the mental wherewithal to get in a real debate. I tried to remember all the reasons posted in this subreddit to combat the idea that Jesus is the Messiah and  all of this stuff but I couldn't come up with anything articulate. If I had even mentioned the Shema

I learned from this how devious these people are, I know I do believe in Hashem, and that He is One, and that it's wrong for anyone else to tell me that I should not. I am not fully practicing yet but I want to be. It is not every day that I can say the Shema in the mornings and at night but when I do, I mean it, and that's something no one can take from me.

I was fully practicing up until I first got to college in NYC 2 years ago. In fact, I felt complete. 

Things suddenly transformed when I tried to get involved in the Orthodox community at my university,"" someone who didn't go to the local Jewish High Schools, the same Yeshivahs in Israel for a Gap Year, and no effort was made to invite me into any of the social circles. It was weird though: outside of the Hillel circle (which was predominantly Modern Orthodox), I was able to become great friends with many of the Jewish kids on campus, but when it came time to come together for services, they reintegrated into their old

For the first month of school, or unpopular to suddenly be treated differently, despite being of the same faith, even the same religiosity. 

While I struggled to continue to go to Hillel events, my standard answers were failing me: I used to believe in a community where everyone was welcome, where if my hometown buddies saw someone who didn't have a Sabbath meal, that guy/girl was coming to one of our houses. Without a community, what was I doing. After first semester, I started to use my phone on the Sabbath. This turned into using the computer, and gradually I lost the Sabbath completely Friday nights, meet non-Jewish girls and put their numbers in my phone. 

This felt great for a while, but use electricity on the Sabbath? 

It's been two years since my spiritual world became all convoluted. And while I know that my story doesn't involve some life tragedy, to be apart of the community, but my philosophy has changed: why should I have to force my way to be accepted? Shouldn't the transition of leaving home to attend university inherently involve meeting people of all different backgrounds, branching out and culturally expanding your horizons? Why would I want to be a part of a homogeneous group, one which isolates itself from any slight variable form. 

If you have read this so far, I'm not angry, just sad. Sad because I feel as though I am lacking a huge part of life that used to define me. And I know many of you may wonder why I didn't attempt to find alternatives to the campus hillel. I'm going to. That's not the point of this post. 

The point is that for any individuals out there (and heck, but you also have the chance to possibly save someone's faith. We don't have to be so insular. The basic tenants of our tradition exemplify welcoming guests and making them feel at home. So if you see someone who didn't go to the same highschool as everyone else, or isn't from the same town as most, who cares? This person is a member of your faith, someone who believes the same core concepts that you do, and someone who deserves the same friendly ""Good Shabbas"" as anyone of your established companions. 

TL;DR: A welcoming community can make all the difference.     

Edit: Just wanted to thank everyone for their responses--it's honestly really comforting to know that many have been through similar situations and eventually found happiness.

1349869936.0,118x7a,A Simchat Torah story,SilentChujo,25,0,5,"This was my first Simchat Torah. My various firsts are hardly noteworthy - I know they've happened to everyone before

While I spent last year having my various first holidays, I was getting increasingly antsy about it - having only what I'd read in books to go on, as to what I could expect past the family I study with's simple 'Well, there's going to be a lot of singing, and dancing, and the Torah scrolls get paraded.'

We went, and the whole energy of the shul was... palpable. The whole congregation felt like it was on tenterhooks. It was my first time back at the M.O. shul I'd been going to, since I moved out in June. The kevanah in the air was exciting.

As Ma'ariv passed and the festivities begin, and asking them to please let me just watch, and sing, from a distance: ""I can't go up / it would be inappropriate / what if I drop a scroll, and we all have to fast?/ I'm still only preparing for my conversion, I shouldn't be touching the Torah at all / I don't want to desecrate anything!""

Eventually, as a few circles of dancing men started to form up around the bimah. I was half ready to run. As we passed the women's section, my friend flagged his mother. 

""He's too scared to carry the Torah. Will you please put some sense into him?""

""Why are you afraid?"" 

I explained

She moved us both away from the crowd on either side of the barrier, before we got married, told me the -exact- same thing at his first Simchat Torah. In the end, he went up, even though he was afraid, like you are. And he loved it. He said it was... incredible. You're going to be just fine, and you're not going to desecrate anything. Now go on. Get in line. And I had better see you dancing up there!""

I got up, trying to hold on to my nerves. The first of the hakafot ended, and a scroll found itself in my arms.

At first, and dance, and sing songs I was learning as I heard them for the first time. And until it started to sink in that after two years of study, and after everything, all the praying, the holidays, the fasting, changing my life around the Torah...here it was

It was incredible.

I didn't want to cry, danced harder, and held tighter to the scroll. I could understand the joy on everyone's faces. The enthusiasm in their voices, and in their bodies.  When, eventually, I passed it off and joined one of the circles of dancers, I caught a glimpse of my friend's mom in the women's section again.

1362510888.0,19q1ja,An explanation why Orthodoxy is bothered.,AlmightyMexijew,39,14,242,"On another thread

Someone commented they hoped to see Orthodoxy give the non-Orthodox movements some more credit and recognition for their own vibrancy and it would lead to mutual respect.  My replies followed with the view that this was a false vibrancy and reasons why.

I am taking time out of my packing for Birthright to address this on a deeper level

**Why is Orthodoxy so bothered by Non-Orthodox movements??**

The answer is simple: We predicted

But it definitely is more complex than that.  The answer also draws in history and geography.  Orthodoxy used to just be ""the traditional way"".  There were differing views on individual elements but nobody dared to claim they were going to just upheave everything and throw out large portions of Judaism.

An example: The feud of Litvish(Lithuanian) yeshivaniks and the Chassidim of the Baal Shem Tov.  There was an agreement that Judaism mattered. The problem merely had to do with the difference between rigid legal study or trying to outwardly express the spirituality and connection one felt.  Neither side uprooted anything significant. They kept halacha

However, and the denial of the religio-legal system(halacha) weren't small things.  They were changes to the very essence of what Judaism was.

So...How can we not be bothered that a whole movement exists that says ""We hold it to be dogma that G-d doesn't need to exist"" or ""We hold it to be dogma that G-d may exist, a Higher Power, isn't unquestionable in existence?

Accordingly, Conservative/Masorti is bleeding people both directions.  The serious become closer to Orthodoxy, while the less serious disassociate entirely.

**Why do you arrogantly feel that we have inferior/non-existant Jewish education? Who made you the arbiter?**

Um...If one considers the amount of Reform attendants of Jewish educational facilities, people would rather water down the few things they'd like to talk about. So...in the end, those kids that do have exposure might be able to stutter out aleph-bet and have a nicely decorate wall full of fingerpaintings of Bible stories.

A vast majority of non-Orthodox children have NO EXPOSURE TO JUDAISM IN ANY FASHION. PERIOD.

Contrast this to say............every kid of large 6-12 member families sitting in yeshiva from age 3 - age 22.  Everyday learning for 12 hours purely Judaism and Jewish topics/philosophy/law/etc.

On 1 side

On the other side, etc.  Even if they G-d forbid choose to turn away from religion, they at least have a strong opinion with real support.

Orthodoxy is very upset for good reason.  There are plenty of Orthodox doctors, computer engineers, and all sorts of trades and fields. They are capable of getting a secular education and contrary to the handful of weirdos in Israel or Lakewood, a majority are educated secularly as well.

Yet non-Orthodoxy only seeks to hide people from their Jewish roots. It takes the very approach it accuses the ""Ultra Orthodox"" of

Understand that we are upset because whole generations have no connection to themselves, party, and pretend to be like others.  The whole flag of ""Open-mindedness"" you rallied behind..That became ""Every man for himselfdom"". It became hating one's own cousins and brothers because they believe in something with an educated opinion that you don't have any proof beyond ""well some guy says""/""I feel it""/""There is too much death in the world"".

**Chanukkah and Thanksgiving: A once in eternity overlap**

Next year features an anomaly for American Jews - The first day of Chanukkah coincides with Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving is set as the fourth Thursday in November, this is approximately correct - the last time it would have happened is 1861. However, Thanksgiving was only formally established by President Lincoln in 1863. So, it has never happened before. Why won't it ever happen again?

The reason is because the Jewish calendar is very slowly getting out of sync with the solar calendar, such that the earliest Hanukkah can be is 11/29. The last time Chanukkah falls on 11/28 is 2146 (which happens to be a Monday). Therefore, 2013 is the only time Chanukkah will ever overlap with Thanksgiving.

I ended up at last night's siyum by a total fluke, so much of the enthusiasm and praise for that process didn't resonate with me. While I was happy for all those around me who had made their siyum, I definitely wasn't clapping or singing as loudly as some of them. The speakers were good (R' Frand especially), but I was extraordinarily disappointed at having to leave before R' Lau spoke. For those of you unaware, the program ran long and R' Lau's speech took place after the last train back to Manhattan, so anyone who didn't drive in had to leave early.

What I didn't realize was that having to take the train back early afforded me the opportunity for a truly moving experience, so I stayed in my seat. The group was as mixed as you can get: chassidim, yeshivish guys, one or two MO fathers and a few YU guys, even a couple young men who might have been conservative (maybe Israelis or *very* LWMO, didn't ask). It was extraordinarily moving to watch them all daven together on this train, some reading from pocket siddurim, one or two with their eyes closed davening from memory. You could hear when someone davened a different nusach then someone else, and the rocking of the train amplified the shuckeling

This was very moving as it was, in his 50s, and had a long, thick beard. He smiled at me when he sat down, asked how I found the siyum, commiserated on the misfortune of missing R' Lau's speech. He too had davened previously, and when the other men began to pray we both sat quietly and watched. About halfway through I glanced at him, smiled and said

We didn't speak the rest of the trip

And now my polite request. I mentioned it somewhere else on this subreddit, I would genuinely appreciate the opportunity to hear what he had to say.

-Could you please explain the general differences between Judaism and Christianity? What I know (which is very little haha) is that Jews do not believe that Jesus is the Messiah

-Do Jews believe in humans being saved? In other words

-Can you go to heaven by being a ""moral"" person.

I hope this doesn't get downvoted and/or flamed

Edit: Thanks for all the responses!
Just a few more questions then..
-I don't mean this in any disrespectful manner, but followed them could be allowed to enter heaven. I have been discussing this a bit with my roommate who is Jewish, but what is the point of the Jewish religion if it comes down to morality? I say this because Christian missionaries are spreading the word of God and the ""point"", I guess is for them to help people understand that acceptance in Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven. It is not just being moral per se. 

- Also, could someone explain a little more deeply what the Jewish messiah is characterized by/will do? ShamanSTK stated that the Jewish messiah is not a miracle worker, or a prophet, and certainly not God (also, I noticed that the answers did not spell out God, and I'm extremely sorry if I'm being offensive if this in fact the case) then what is the messiah supposed to be?

I made a new account for this, and despite my intellectual dissatisfactions as a youth, I was swept back in thanks to a combination of the pseudo-intellectual diatribes of Aish HaTorah, a deep need for meaning, and my respect for my father (himself a ""baal teshuva"").  I went to a rightwing yeshiva for several years post-high school; the rosh yeshiva is a tremendous intellect and shockingly open minded, despite being a longtime student of R' Moshe Shapiro.  I really enjoy the intellectual exercise of learning, and as a youth

But after leaving yeshiva, killing homosexuals, banning free discussion, etc.).  Many of the biblical narratives began to grate on me.  And as time progresses, I find that I'm no longer able to ignore the lack of evidence for biblical integrity, much less evidence for the existence of God.

I am ostensibly part of the Orthodox community because I find it to have many wonderful facets, as it were - I can argue against the positions espoused by many on the right, but I find the counter positions to be just as untenable.  I see comments by many in the blogosphere attacking the ahistorical lunacy of YWN or cross-currents, but ultimately, I find the extension of those arguments to lead to an anti-religious perspective; I often wonder if the authors ignore the logical conclusions of their own arguments in order to retain legitimacy.

So, ""When you move into your parent's house there will be things you do away with, things you keep and things you bring in.""

That's the short answer. The long answer is that Reconstructionism is about finding a happy medium between ancient culture, and modern limitations and new possibilities. One good example, what do we consider working on Shabbat? I certainly don't consider playing a few video games working. However another member of my Synagogue actively removes personal electronics from his house every Friday and takes them back in Saturday evening. 

So as a Reconstructionist, reflect and study. For my friend, they represent his work and strife during the week.

I am 27 and raised in a Muslim family and around me nearly everyone hated Jews and expected me to do the same thing and i don't like doing things without reason. so i wanted to find out. and everyone keeps bringing up Palestine and there are so many angles to that story i don't even know but the images on the news (guns vs stones) doesn't help the jews much. but i like most of you know actions and words of a government are far from the people's that it governs. 

so i did a little research i read about the Ashkenazi Jews and stuff like Antisemitism which is really sad. and the poor Jewish people have always been hunted

now what i see is that the Jews are united people and that is rare in the human species and something to be respected. but why people have so much hate for them. to me they have awesome food they are funny people and enjoy life, they have honor and respect in a household. they have rules and culture. 

 i have no reason to hate. i actually like them after all i read. and finding out most of my Favorite comedians are Jewish. so maybe you can tell me why have they been hated so much cause its not just some people. it's alot of people throughout history!

I, nominally Christian home, and always was a non-believer. As an adult (I'm 56), my lack of belief has been strengthened by such things as the fact that I see no reason to assume the theory of evolution doesn't explain our human form, etc.

On the other hand, is aware AT ALL or has experiences AT ALL. And I am in a good position to say that, because I have personally contributed a small bit to the field of ""artificial intelligence"" -- some of my ideas on how to automatically distinguish spam emails from wanted emails using mathematical formulas have been incorporated into a number of widely-used email spam filters.

I just don't believe that the concept of God provides any answers that help explain why we are here. One reason is the simple conundrum: if the Universe couldn't have existed without a God to create it, so WHATEVER factors led to the creation of the Universe ""existed outside of time"". 

We simply don't know what those factors were

And I am perfectly fine saying ""I don't have any idea how the universe came about"". I don't feel a need to assume any particular answer that has come down to us through any particular religious tradition is correct

But again, intelligent atheists do think that, actually.)

And I can even imagine calling ""the factors that led to the creation of the universe"" by the name God. To me

But what I am completely unable to do is believe that there is a conscious, or the holy books of any other ancient religion, Who etched commandments on a tablet, told the Jews to kill all the Canaanites, or caused all the first-born Egyptian males to die during Passover. They seem so extremely unlikely to me, that I think it makes more sense to call me an atheist than an agnostic.

(Again, I might have ended up believing exactly that. But that ""I"" wouldn't really be the ""me"" that I in fact am!)

Now my problem.

My wife deeply needs to attend seders. And she feels extremely hurt and offended if I do not accompany her. The problem is that I feel extremely hypocritical sitting at the Seder table, our G-d, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all people, and raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments."" I simply cannot believe that that actually happened, or that there is a enough of a chance that it did that I could be labeled anything but an atheist with respect to such assertions. 

But in addition to that

The upshot is that I don't see how I can participate in saying the words, and each year that I do I have come to feel more and more strongly that I am being a hypocrite when I do so. And I don't think the other Seder participants would want me there if they knew I was feeling that way. And I don't want to feel that way. But I also don't want to make my wife miserable and stress our relationship in the major ways that it does when I simply stay home and she goes alone.

I have, but somehow it doesn't seem to make much difference to her. I am perfectly happy for her to attend and have an experience that is meaningful to her, I just haven't been able to do so myself without  increasingly feeling like a hypocrite. 

This year

She got the Rabbi's wife on the phonem and told her I that I am ""not Jewish"" but ""am interested."" And the Rabbi's wife told her I wouldn't have to do anything I didn't want to. 

But I don't think my wife accurately presented the situation to the Rabbi's wife, would actually be able to live with me just sitting there as not only a non-Jew, but an atheist who is deeply uncomfortable with some aspects of the Seder, not doing any of the things the other people at the table are doing.

All this has created a situation that seems impossible to me. But maybe I'm wrong

Again, I certainly don't have a basis to think I have any answers, since I believe I would probably be a believer if I happened to have been raised in a different household. I just am unable to be someone other than who I am, and I have a real problem, and I don't know where else to go for help. Hopefully others in similar situations could also be helped by any suggestions!

Many thanks in advance for any thoughts anyone chooses to share.


**UPDATE:** I want to thank everyone in this community who responded. The vast majority of responses have been extremely valuable. I am extremely heartened by the viewpoint that people here wouldn't condemn me for taking part in the seder even without being a believer. It makes me feel that it's likely that the other people attending the seder would also be able to live with me being as I am and still participating.

A few people said I was over-thinking it. I've been accused of that before with respect to other things. :)  It's the way I am. It does have certain advantages

I think I can safely say that the Reddit/Judaism community has helped my marriage. :)  Thank you SO much.

**The day before:** (today)

You are supposed to try and give some charity today if/when possible. Ask others for forgiveness, it is a mitzvah to do so today.

It is recommended for men to go to the mikveh today.

Most people try and do [Tashlich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashlikh) by today

**The day of**

*The five forbidden things.*

1. No eating and/or drinking. If you have a medical need or are nursing/pregnant

2. No leather shoes. This only applies to shoes. Leather belts, don't make the same mistake I did. Suede is leather. I wore suede shoes for a few years until last year when my wife pointed out that I am indeed an idiot. If you don't have non-leather shoes, you are allowed to daven with only socks.

3. No bathing or washing. This refers to such activities for pleasure. You can wash your hands for hygienic reasons (bathroom, only the bare minimum required, which is usually up to the knuckles. Showering can be done before Yom Kippur, so there is no reason to have a bath/shower on Yom Kippur, even for hygiene. 

4. No anointing yourself with perfumes or lotions. This includes deodorant. According to my Rabbi

5. No marital relations. I hope this is simple enough.

*In shul*

Many married men wear a [kittel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittel). I do

There are five prayers across the day. This is compared to the usual three for a weekday

There is nothing wrong with bringing something to read. The day is long

Its great to be back again!

About a year ago I was at an archaeological dig in Perak (Malaysia) with Prof. Mokhtar from Universiti Sans Malaysia (USM). He and his team have been uncovering stone axes with confirmed dates of a whopping 1.8 million years! Here is a [link](http://arkeologis.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/latest-archaeological-discovery-in-malaysia/) to an article about the archaeological find.

Being a practicing Muslim and knowing Prof. Mokhtar to be an even more devout Muslim than myself

He explained that there is an obscure Hadith in Sunni Islam about there having been more than one Prophet Adam, there are several Hadiths testifying to this and these Shi'a Hadiths specifically mention there having been ten (10) previous Prophet Adam.

I have tried asking about this in r/Islam; but the post didn't generate terribly much interest. Furthermore

In lieu of the similarities between Judaism and Islam; I was wondering if there might be some Jewish texts which might reference there having been previous or multiple Prophet Adams? A fellow redditor said something about ""Midrash"" as a possible source.

* Your lack of knowledge does *not* indicate a lesser status as a person or as a Jew. No one should ever look down at you and say that you are somehow worse because of a lack of a knowledge base.

Recently, we had around a quarter of the users (Somewhere is a screen cap of 613 users)  I encourage everybody of all backgrounds to sign up for a Dvar Torah.  It is a little way to spread some Judaism around the world.  We can share with each other what we feel is important to each of us.  Secular to yeshiva bochur, you are all welcome, and encouraged to sign up for one.

On another note; what can I do, we have done a lot as a community.  A lot of it was with your input.  Each of the r/Judaism resources was done by the community.  The various links on the sidebar was vetted by the community.  What else can we do around here to make this as welcome and interesting place as possible?

He realized immediately that it could be an early warning sign and that there may be a problem that necessitated further exploration. He was admitted to the hospital and will be undergoing bypass surgery tomorrow morning (**Rav Reuven Shmuel ben Yitta** for those willing to pray for him). Today from his hospital room he sent out an email with the following message that was entitled [The Fantasy of Immortality](https://docs.google.com/open?id=1l2QkJD2_4VcmZL9dWE9yVzZu1_ngGIloFRN7-Z5qL7dDpzLDj6ziq-K1tye9): 

*This week’s parsha, who alone are mandated to perform the Temple service.  The first subject taken up is that of Tumat Meit (defilement by contact with a corpse).  A Kohen may not visit a cemetery or enter a building in which there is a “meit”.  This rule applies to all dead bodies except for his seven close relatives.  In these cases the law is that he must forgo his state of purity and become impure by attending the funeral of his family members.*  

*At first glance the prohibition of assisting in the burial of the dead is not easy to comprehend.  There are few mitzvot as significant as honoring the deceased by eulogizing, one of the greatest obstacles to perfection is the “fantasy of immortality.”  It is part of human nature to be incapable of imagining our own demise.  We take it for granted that we will go on indefinitely and this emotion stands in the way of our perfection.  We waste a great deal of time on superficial and trivial pursuits and do not invest sufficient energy in obtaining wisdom and improving our middot because we don’t sense the urgency to do so.  As long as things are going well for a person he is disinclined to consider that life is short and the work of perfecting oneself is great.  It is only when he encounters loss and tragedy that the temporal nature of life sinks in.  The death of a friend or acquaintance breaks through the illusion of immortality.  It reminds a person that he is no different than the niftar (deceased) and that his time is limited and if he is wise he will begin, immediately, to put it to good use.  Thus the question remains, why are the Kohanim who are dedicated to Hashem’s service forbidden to be in contact with a meit?* 

*The primary role of the Kohen is to dedicate himself to the study of Torah and to teaching it to the Jewish people.  As the verse states

I am in the process of learning about Reform Judaism. I recently spoke with an Orthodox rabbi who explained to me that it would be better for someone to remain a Righteous Gentile than to convert to (Reform) Judaism.

I asked him whether or not he considers Reform Jews Jewish. He said

I then asked, ""Yes.""

It was my first encounter with an Orthodox Jew (and rabbi

hard to imagine that significant numbers of Jews would leave the US

replaced with a dictator that could happen; likewise if (as seems
almost impossible) there were to be a government that persecuted Jews.
 Always wise for Jews to be vigilant about antisemitism

BubbaMetzia:  The urban riots may well have been the death knell for
some urban Jewish communities
between Blacks and Jews.  But (as article in Journal of American
History by L.Corwin Berman showed this year) even Jews who left urban
areas
intermarriage:  it began to rise steeply  in 1960s at the same time
that Americans of all kinds began to marry across religions and races.
Certainly

namer98 - Baal teshuva movement drew some of the more serious Jews in
the Conservative Movement to Orthodoxy
crucial variable in that movement's decline.  As America polarized
religiously centrist movements all fell into decline (the Protestant
ones too). RCA had accepted stationary microphones and Baltimore's
Beth Tfillah put one in
rabbinic authority for RCA if it reversed that ruling.  Nowadays
organization in Israel named Tzomet has designed a microphone system
that many Orthodox leaders are willing to accept. Hasidic Jews differ
from Haredi Jews in their approach to study and to spirituality; they
also dress differently and view their rabbis differently.  For other
differences (even demographic ones)
Population Survey which distinguishes the groups from one another.  My
interest in American Jewish history developed in high school.  I am a
first generation American from a scholarly Jewish family and this was
a wide open field.    I am hoping to write a new chapter covering
developments in American Judaism since 2004.  Have not titled it yet.
  I only know of one woman privately ordained in Germany -- Regina
Jonas.  There were no Reform private ordinations at that time in US
and the US Reform decision (as a group) preceded that of other
countries in ordaining women.     Influence of R. Samson R. Hirsch on
US Jewry deserves a full-scale study:  different movements within
Orthodoxy view Hirsch differently

Modern Judaism; I would not know how to weigh their respective
influences (differ by person and by synagogue). I deal a bit with
future trends in American Jewish life in conclusion of American
Judaism.

Louis_Farizee - Postwar American Jews felt responsible for world
Jewry.  Cold war meant that helping Soviet Jews was also patriotic.
The sense that American Jewry did not do enough in 193-s and 40s was
also a motivation for some.  Beckerman and others show that JDL
greatly declined after it injured innocent civilians (and Jews) in its
bombings. While JDL played a role in early Soviet Jewry movement
was not a significant factor later on in my view.

heres_a_llama - Impossible to compare 1825 (when two largest Jewish
communities were Charleston &amp; NY and they differed) with situation
today.  New York is exceptional because density of Jews is so much
greater in NY:  only in NY can secular Jews absorb something of a
Jewish atmosphere from their neighbors (as happens in Israel)
only in NY do Jews have such a strong sense of numbers in many
neighborhoods as to feel empowered.  Both Southern Judaism and Western
Judaism are different in many ways
are actually differences from city to city - contrast
San Francisco and LA or Miami and Memphis.    In terms of Conservative
movement:  it does face challenges
Reform in 1930s
Conservative movement at this point is that it has fewer children
(whether it indoctrinates them or not) than either Orthodoxy or
Reform.  So it will need to lure people away from other movements --
which good synagogues can do!

elizabethraine - Converts should keep in mind that Judaism is not only
a different religion from Christianity
of a whole people.  By converting to Judaism a convert suddenly takes
upon herself Jewish relatives around the world.  In short
the tribe!

Ninjew333 - The many movements in Judaism have strengthened Judaism in
America by creating many options. Dissatisfied Jews always have other
movements/synagogues to explore; they need not opt out.  But even
though there are many kinds of Jews there is still
Jewish people (just as America is very divided
American people).

aalorni - Many American Jews of the immigrant era read THE RISE OF
DAVID LEVINSKY and were shaped by that book.  Milton Steinberg's AS A
DRIVEN LEAF remains most inspiring.   Assimilation is always a
realistic scenario in a free society:  many Caribbean Jews assimilated
out of existence
Tribes.  You are quite right that most American Jews consider
self-identity the determinant of Judaism which is not the case in
Israel.  The Israeli chief rabbinate is not very much respected today
in America (or in Israel) but that could change if there were a
different chief rabbi.

Miragoat - small birthrates
religious affiliation threaten Judaism today.  Jewish values do not
change

Siecle - There was indeed talk of reconciliation between liberal Jews
