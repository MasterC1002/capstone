The rigors of my day require a fresh demeanor;

I will endeavor to contrive one!

With alacricity I descend the staircase

The maid

has prepared me a bowl of milled oats.

I fortify myself quickly.  The morning advances apace!

On the street I join the throng of other young scholars

Vying for a seat on the public motorcoach

Come to fetch us to the halls of Academia.

[]

What luck!

I see my boon companions

Roll up in a spacious convertible roadster!

Reposing on the front cushions in affected insouciance

Sitting pretty in the rumble seat

They beckon from both compartments

Presenting me with an enjoyable dilemma!

[]

I opt to sit astern and we're off!

Flush with the exuberance of youth

We sing a favorite school cheer

[]

*""Friday

*Jitterbug and jive tonight!*

*Hail

*Revel! Revel!  Rah Rah Rah!""*

[]

Forty-five minutes ago I was in bed.

Yet now

Motoring down the thoroughfare at lofty speeds

My mind wrestles with the rapid juxtaposition!

Yet

I ache for the minutes to pass faster still!

I dwell deeply on thoughts of revelry.

Can you glimpse the depths of my wanton musings?

My bosom friend

Indulges in thoughts as dissipated and licentious as my own

We exchange knowing glances.

[]

I savor the profound thought

That yesterday

Impelled nonetheless

The manifestation of this glorious Friday! 

My friends and I have worked ourselves up to a fever pitch

We hum like electric dynamos.

We shall suck the marrow from this day!

[]

Saturday if it can be believed

Followed blythely by an inevitable Sunday

Portending the end to my frolics

And if I dare to ponder deeper

Perhaps the symbolic waning of my own misspent youth.

But I shall not dwell on that.

I return to the vivid presence of this sublime moment!

[]

*""Friday

*Jitterbug and jive tonight!*

*Hail

*Revel! Revel!  Rah Rah Rah!""*

I started following this subreddit a few months ago. And I did so because I enjoyed reading the text posts and their comments. Like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/pl7i5/i_do_say_old_chaps/), if you take a look at the [top-scoring posts of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all), all you will see are imgur.com links. Sure, a picture is worth a thousand words and all, but ... I liked the text posts more. They were like going a couple of centuries back in time and witnessing a conversation between people of those days. However, these pictures, they are worthless. Whenever I see a link from /r/proper on my frontpage and the domain is imgur.com, while posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/v64xe/i_have_misplaced_my_top_hat_how_embarrassing/) go unnoticed.

   This is a chronicle of my younger years and illustrates how I became the young gentleman that I am today. It is a tale of ups and downs

   I am originally from the borough of Drexel Hill in Philadelphia, I was trifling about with my schoolmates as was normal, when all of a sudden, a posse of fiendish jackanapes approached us and began harassing us in a most upsetting fashion. I'll admit, I lost my temper in a most unbecoming convention. I engaged one of the brutish miscreants in fisticuffs and was savagely beaten, as I was acutely outnumbered. Upon seeing my bruised and disconcerted visage, my mother was in quite a state of bedlam. She finally came upon the conclusion that since my father had departed long ago, that she was is no fit state to properly raise me any longer. She decreed that in order for me to receive an adequate rearing

   I was most displeased by this decision to uproot my existence but, I stood on the street with all the belongings I could transport and accosted a taxi coach to ferry me to my new residence. The carriage was piloted by a ghastly chap who had decorated the interior of the vehicle with a number of gaudy knickknacks. This driver was a rare fellow indeed, I thought, surrounding himself with such crude trinkets in a commercial transport. 

   We talked and conversed for the duration of the considerable trip, this gentleman had quite an offensive odor. By now, it was around 7 pm or 8 pm. I unloaded my things and gazed upon my new kingdom. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief as I realized that I had, at long last, arrived to claim my rightful place as the Prince of the community known as Bel-Air in the city of Los Angeles in the state of California.",,False,t5_2rg96,True

&gt; Miami Booster: I Gave Improper Benefits To Players

&gt; Shapiro, cars, yacht trips, jewelry, televisions and other gifts to players. He also claimed he paid for 
nightclub outings, in one case, an abortion for a woman impregnated by a player.

Indeed
of higher learning. I must extend my apologies to the eminently refined gentlemen and ladies in our presence- as recounts of 
such scandalous liaisons have no doubt offended their delicate sensibilities. However
offering an interpretation of what would constitute 'proper' benefits in this scenario. This category shall include

- Tickets to a rollicking polo match- these have the propensity to become most raucous

- Participation in a rousing game of chess or bridge- preferably in the company of undoubtedly experienced and patrician individuals- perhaps the finest players which the East India Company has to offer. 

- An afternoon tea party- it is most always amusing to spend countless hours indulging in the splendor of the finest teas and cakes and ices that polite society can afford 

- Since I am having reservations regarding this 'automobile' nonsense

- I do enjoy a fine yacht outing- who among us shall be so destitute as to not own a yacht?

- Contra to engaging one's carnal desires with members of the opposite gender- I suggest our fine young scholars instead seek to 
stimulate their intellectual needs. This accomplished by means of fruitful and vigorous discussion of the latest and finest in literature and sciences which cultured society has to offer. I do realize that inter mixture of unwed men and women has the potential to lead to some rather sinful indulgences- however

- While I am unsure about what exactly this 'abortion' subject entails- if it is what I think its entomology suggests- then good Heavens! What hath God wrought? It is common knowledge that the proper way to deal with unwanted neophytes is to leave them alone in the wilderness and place their fate entirely in God's hands. My wife and I, and with, I am most happy to report, great success. 

The aforementioned conditions do describe what I would consider to be 'proper' scenarios- fitting for the most distinguished student-athletes at the finest educational establishments which civilization has yet to conjure up.

To begin: a poorly photoshopped mustache does not a Proper post make. Yes, dog, duck, or any other animal is simply irritating and does nothing to contribute to this distinguished and proper society. The same principle applies to top hats, monocles, canes, white gloves, or any other normally desirable fancy accessory.

One particular post has appalled me in its popularity. This is a post that is entitled: I submit for your prurient persusal; Proper Porn. 

To begin with, is that any one among us may consider such obscene material may be in even the slightest way proper. Indeed, I may venture to say that anything that one may not proudly display in the workplace is not at all proper. 

My third complaint is somewhat related. Vocabulary does not make a post proper. One could have the most correct grammar to ever be heard

In short, and I beseech you, my brothers and sisters, to correct your course before it leads this fine society to become a den of iniquity and unabashed memery. I believe we are in the most imminent danger of such an unthinkable crisis becoming a reality, and I pray I am not alone in my position.

Thank you for your time

I find myself visiting this fine establishment quite often, yet all I happen to find are few posts that are almost always more than a week old. I find that very odd, considering that we have, as the sidebar says, over 25,000 distinguished persons who are enrolled in this fine establishment. I dare say this, but could it be because of the fact that we are rather unwelcoming of those who do not possess the highest propriety?

First I must ask that you forgive my brazen use in this proper tongue. I can very well produce each sentence in a flowing

Now as I move to the question at hand, or Beethoven. Last year, I stumbled upon a new name in the Classical Scene, and very quickly I fell in love with his music. I am referring to Ludovico Einaudi, grandson of Luigi Einaudi, *Second President of the Italian Republic 1948-1955*

Ludovico is thought of as an Alternative Classical composer whose music is described as ""ambient, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop.""

What I ask is, or with a certain degree of ambivalence are you sworn to embrace the names of centuries past? [For such a question I have provided a link to a concert Ludovico performed in 2010. It will start midway through and for the next 35 minutes, consist of what I feel, - is the definition of perfection.](http://youtu.be/PAuwd-4yYHE?t=25m16s)

As do we all, have a hat appropriate to both the occasion and to the fabric and cut of one's livery.

Sadly

Happily

I therefore seek assistance in locating a reputable haberdasher, that I may be proud once again to don it.

Not one to take without giving in return

To that I would add: ""particularly where there is a mismatch between the linguistic capabilities of the speaker

So tongue-in-cheek part over - am I likely to be berated for correcting people in this sub?  The incorrect use of '5 dollar words' can make one look silly - much more silly than were one just to use language with which one is comfortable.  It can come across as pretentious and ill-informed.

On the front page at the moment there are countless examples of the misuse of proper English (I'm not talking grammatical errors; I'm talking completely incorrect use of words)

In my view it's better to be corrected in here than in the real world.

Does anyone agree?  Or am I being unreasonable?  I'd very much like to help people to enjoy language in this style,False,,t5_2rg96,1344720636.0,,,t3_y1m5m
