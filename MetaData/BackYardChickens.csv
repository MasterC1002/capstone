Why should you care?  Setting aside the notion that our livestock heritage is worth saving because it represents a hugely important component of our history as a species, the staggering array of heirloom chicken breeds were bred to adapt to any number of environmental pressures --extreme cold, extreme heat, predators-- and they are extraordinarily adept at surviving in a hostile, often free-range world.  They also provide superior-tasting meat and eggs.  

A recent study shows that 94% of all heirloom vegetable varieties in America became extinct.  They did so because hybrid vegetables in the 1940s and then genetically modified vegetables in the 1990s offered a more productive alternative to farmers under

Potentially every Redditor who keeps chickens can play a role as a 'seed saver;' keeping a small flock of heirloom breed chickens that are simultaneously a key part of our agricultural past and an important part of the future that our children may one day enjoy.

**Chicken wire is for keeping chickens in
Many predators can easily rip or bite through chicken wire
  
The best way to reinforce your run and any windows on the coop is with welded wire or hardware cloth. This is a smaller gauge hole that is welded, so it's near impossible to get through. It *is* more expensive, so if cost is an issue, only use it on the lower portion of the structure.  
I'd also *highly* recommend adding an apron of hardware cloth (some bent to lay flush to the ground going out 6+ inches) to prevent digging predators

Inside this pen hanging from the center about 2 ft from the floor is a standard clamp-on utility light with a 23w LED bulb in it. This is hooked to a timer that turns on about 9pm and turns off at around 5am. The light can be seen all night from quite a distance and that is good.  

Next to the light are the perches. To get closer to the light they must fly to a perch. The first one is about 10"" from the floor and they get higher like a leaning ladder. 

If it is still a bit chilly in the spring I put a white 125W heat lamp in the fixture instead of the LED bulb to help keep the chicks warm. It also kills some of the bugs making them easy pick'ins for the chicks. 


What this light does is attract insects

Do not do this with your hens or it will disrupt their laying. Make sure the pen is bulletproof as this will also attract predators. If the predators can get in they will. 

We have a porch swing and we love to sit out there at night and watch the chicks running

EDIT: [HERE](http://s951.photobucket.com/user/valkyrie1234/media/Baby%20Pen%20Light/BabyPen2copy.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=0) are the pics of the cage. 

I went out to take video tonight but they are all very tired from the move out of the brooder and there isn't much action yet. An occasional bug would end up in the pen and get devoured in seconds. We have had 1"" of rain in the past 3 weeks and it's starting to look like last summer here with the drought. The bug population is currently very low. I'll keep checking and when the birds settle in and we get some rain I'll get some good video and post it.

1349876774.0,1191r4,Raising Chickens in Very Cold Climates,valkyrie123,43,7,28,"Hi guys it's my cake day so I thought I'd give you a gift. I'm the owner operator of Ice Dragon Farms and we have been raising 1000's of birds for the last 30+ years. Our main line of business is selling hatching eggs. We are located in northern Minnesota so we are very used to cold temps and I thought I'd pass on some of the things we have learned about how to keep your birds alive and healthy during a long cold winter.

1. The perch. This is the most important tip

2. Heated water bowls will make hauling water in the winter much easier as no where near as much will be needed. The bowls will not be frozen requiring it to be beat on something to get the ice out. Letting the water bowl freeze deprives the birds of water and stresses them

3. Protect your birds from drafts. Birds can handle cold

4. If you want eggs in the winter put a light with a timer hooked to it to add a few extra hours of 'daylight' to their lives and the will reward you with eggs. I use an LED light bulb ($20) as it uses almost no electricity.

5. If you put a heat lamp in your coop make sure it doesn't get knocked down or burnt out. Heat lamps can easily cause a fire if in contact with straw or wood. Chickens have no regard of your construction abilities and will fly around the coop crashing into things. If the heat lamp goes out on a very cold night and the hens are not used to the cold they might not make it. 

6. For small operations I have heard that putting Vaseline on a roosters comb will keep it from becoming frost bit. I've got way to many chickens to try this so take it with a grain of salt. 

7. When you build your coop put a lot of glass on the south side and use the passive solar heat. Use double pane glass if possible. I find double pane windows at the dump all the time. The birds will love you for this. 

8. Don't scrimp on food in the winter
   
9. When building your coop put it on high

10. If you are NPIP certified and use metal leg bands to mark your birds the metal can cause frostbite. Consider removing the bands after testing or switch to plastic bands. 

11. Run electric to every pen. This will allow you to plug in a heated water bowl

I'm sure there is a lot more but this will get you on the right track. If you have any questions just ask. 

Edit: is anyone here interested in a Chicken First Aid Kit? I would be happy to make another post and divulge the contents of my kit. I'm a farmer and can't afford vet bills so I have learned how to do it myself. I am not a vet so this is my experience only on how to save money and do it yourself.

I probably could have taken her to the vet and they might have been able to break the egg and extract the contents but the reality of it is that this was not an overly large egg and for her to have such a serious prolapse right off the bat in her laying career

So, an abdomen with a lot of broken yolk and 13 more yolks - seven of them quite large inside her. I know that some of that is normal but with so much ready to go, I doubt I could have got her to stop laying soon enough and long enough to have given her poor little bum a chance to heal and strengthen up. 


I got these chickens knowing that eventually they would stop laying and they would have to be for the soup pot or I would risk becoming the crazy chicken lady with 30 chickens and no eggs. I think that did make it a little easier - I know it did because it I had thought of them as pets

There are no really obvious disagreements among my girls so I thought that finding out who has the best roost might answer the question. This was not to be. I have two coops side by side the four older ladies sleep in one and the new girls take the other. Each coop has two nest boxes and a roost bar. The three older ladies all sleep in one 12x12 nest box. The only reason why Marie isn't in there as well is that as the fattest girl she simply won't fit. She does perch on the back edge of the nest box just above the others. This observation answers my question as to why there is less poop in the coop each morning. Marie poops on the others during the night and they carry it out of the coop in the morning.

The newer girls will only sleep on the roost bar. This bar extends over the entrance and no one will sleep on that part of it. The four girls are sharing about 20"" of space. In addition no one wants to sleep against the wall. They spend a good deal of time jostling one another until someone is pushed off the bar and must take the position closest to the door.

Many of you have probably seen my coop progress and stuff throughout the past several weeks. Before I started this fairly large construction project I wrote my city, foul, poultry, or exotic pets. The city didn't call or write back either. So naturally I assumed that I was ok. I should also mention that I live in a small suburb (population around 40k).

Since completing my build, I really love my birds.

Fast forward to yesterday when an animal control officer rang my doorbell to inform me that there are strict ordinances in my town prohibiting backyard chickens and I have 10 days to remove them from my property. Fuck.

Immediately after the officer left, she couldn't explain why I wasn't answered. 

She did however [graciously] extended my deadline to 30 days. She said that there is a city council meeting coming up soon in which the matter of chicken ordinances would specifically be addressed. Apparently this has already been an issue that's being discussed. She told me that I was welcome to come and put in my 2 cents. 

I've spent so much time, building, and loving my chickens and their habitat. I hate to throw that all away. I plan on attending that meeting. Is there anything I can do? What can I prepare for that meeting?

Please Help!

I come from a long line of chicken farmers - my great grandparents came to America and started a kosher chicken farm in central NJ in the early 1920s.  In the farm's heyday

As the business died down into the late 1980s, and turkeys solely as pets/for eggs.  I grew up (and still live) next door, and have very fond memories of walking over to his house to help feed the birds, collect eggs, and play with baby chicks.  

My grandfather unfortunately passed away years ago.  We maintained his existing bird population

Until a few years ago!

We were strolling around the yard, and his belly was completely shaved, so it's possible people were fighting him.  Anyway, we decided to keep him and set up a small temporary coop in the backyard.  We named him [""The Colonel.""](http://i.imgur.com/SotNH.jpg)

Well, and some bantams.  We had some [Guinea Fowl](http://i.imgur.com/IUxjg.jpg) for a while, but I couldn't take the noise anymore and they found new homes.

The last few winters and hurricanes took their tole on the original ""coop, but here is the new coop:

* Do you have ""chicken"" gear that you wear when handling/mucking out the space? Like rubber boots and a specific coat? How do you wash these items?
* In our city we don't *need* to notify neighbors that we're getting chickens if we live in a single-family dwelling. Do you recommend telling them anyway?
* Our coop/run will need a trench dug around it that we fill with gravel/lava rocks to keep diggers out. What other predator-proofing have you found useful?

I have considered running an extension cord in to run a heated watering bucket as their water freezes if left overnight. For now I am just going to remove the watering can at night and replace it in the am.

I think I might build one of these [pop can heaters](http://youtu.be/XsF9RvVxFc4) I know it won't help at night but It should help with some heat during the day and keep the water from freezing.

**The Chicken Health Handbook  by Gail Damerow**

Pros: A very through book on just about anything that can go wrong with your birds. Well illustrated with pictures and drawings. A 'must have'

Cons: Almost too through. Includes almost everything which can get confusing with all the rare diseases mixed in with the more common and more likely suspects. Some of the testing suggested you cannot do at home without a lab that would attract the attention of the DEA. 

**The Veterinary Guide for Animal Owners   by C. E Spaulding  and Jackie Clay**

Pros: Describes all the common diseases, treatments and prevention. An excellent book to have on the shelf. It covers all common farm livestock including poultry and waterfowl, dogs and cats. Another 'Must Have' on your shelf. Some of you are familiar with Jackie Clay from ['Backwoods Home Magazine'](http://www.backwoodshome.com/). If you aren't you should be, get a prescription, it will make you happy. 

Cons: Not chicken specific. 

**The Merck Veterinary Manual**

Pros: Highly detailed analysis of every animal disease known. Treatments in detail right down to anesthesia used. 

Cons: Way over the layman's head

**Storey's Guide to Raising Poultry**

Pros: Good general health section

Cons: Not specifically about Chicken Health.

After I sold them, I urge you to think it through, and do it right. Both for you, and your hens. Most people only focus on the positives when talking about chickens. I now focus on the impact they had on my life, beyond yummy back yard eggs (on a side note, I probably will never buy grocery store eggs ever again). If you get chickens it means:

- Having to find someone to take care of them if you want to leave for more than a day or two. Finding someone you can trust to take care of your animals well

- Dealing with the seasonal variance of egg production: prodigious amounts in the summer, during the winter months. Sometimes even providing a light wasn't enough to keep them laying.

- Worrying about neighbours complaining, the heat in summer, the cold in winter, poop in the shed, their health, their diet, etc.

- Waking up to the egg laying cackle every.single.morning that they're laying.

- Growing attached to a bird (or multiple birds) that will stop laying enough to pay for her food loooooong before her natural lifespan is up.

1376334438.0,1k83hy,Need Help to change laws in Baltimore County Maryland - we are getting closer!,wintercast,11,1,2,"After years of being ignored by our elected County Council, and with a seven-person Council

 

This legislation is Resolution 73-13

http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/countycouncil/legislation/pending%20legislation.html


 

Baltimore County residents can do FOUR things to help make this change a reality:

 

FIRST: Immediately contact your County Council representative, and would like to see it repealed or revised. Not sure who your Council rep is? Go [here](http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/countycouncilmega.html) and enter your address, then click here to find your rep’s email address and phone number. This is the most important action you can take. Tell them you want to know what their position is, and will expect them to follow up with you based on the outcome of the Planning Board report. Regardless of their position, it will make a big impression on them that you cared enough to take the time to contact them. 

 

SECOND: If possible, at 2:00 pm, at 400 Washington Ave., Second Floor, in Towson, MD. It would be great to have 5-10 people from across the county speak for 2 or 3 minutes each. But we would also like to have many more supporters just show up, so that when we ask for a show of hands by district, so we don’t want to look like a bunch of crazies

 

THIRD: Go to the Facebook page “Change the zoning laws in Baltimore Co. for chickens and small livestock” to stay current on this and related issues.

 

FOURTH: Spread the word – get your neighbors and friends from all parts of Baltimore County to help by taking these four steps themselves.

What we really need is people from other parts of the county where their reps are on the fence – Owings Mills, Towson, Dundalk, etc.

We fixed the potential cause of the problem by modifying the coop. I think she may have gotten her beak caught in the hardwire cloth.

I'm wondering if nerves are exposed or something because she can't eat well. She'll pick up the crumble and let it fall. We tried crushing the crumbles and mixing it with water to make a paste. That worked okay

She won't drink too much

Other than that

I'm thinking that she'll be okay in a few days. She might lose some weight. I'm hoping that

If anyone has any advice that would be great. Maybe someone out there has experienced a similar problem.

I guess the bottom line is: will she be okay?

We also gave her some aspirin to dull the ache. According to what I read


We clean the beak twice to three times a day with saline wash. We also went out and bought [vetericyn](http://vetericyn.com/). Kind of expensive

But he added that he had seen 3 full grown German Shepherds and a pup near my house that very morning.  Now there is only one house on the road with German Shepherds, and they're over a mile and a half away by road.  They do have that same number of dogs, but I had never seen them up near my house.  I was a little suspicious at first I might not be getting the whole truth.  But then the same neighbor stopped by later and told me his son and daughter-in-law had had a cat killed just the night before and that he was worried for his own cows which are soon to be calving.  In other words, he was going to keep a gunsight out for the predators himself.

Well I was still skeptical not knowing how the dogs had come so far and I'd never seen them on my land, I come to a clearing where my parents' drive-way is, and lo and behold, what do I spy coming across the fields from the direction of my house, walking on my father's farm?

Some other friends of ours have chickens and they'll be having a few soon to give away and suggested we take them (I've hinted at being interested).  I honestly don't know much...  But I've been looking at some coops online to get feel for what I'll need.  I'll also be heading over to Agway this weekend and some other local farm supply shops for pre-constructed coops and what not.  So here's my questions!

- What can I expect for daily maintenance/tasks?  Egg collection (once they're production) as well as opening the coop in the morning and closing in the evening? (this leads into my next question)

- Do they need to be in an enclosed area during the day?  Would they roam my property and head back to their coop in the evening

- Time away, or is it always best to get a neighbor or something to tend to them?

- Food.  I've been reading

- Winter.  I live in NY

Well she had been setting and setting and I knew she was close.  I hadn't noticed her one way or the other this morning, but I thought she might be more vulnerable--though the 10 eggs weren't disturbed and there was no blood or feathers around.

Well I searched and searched through all of our barns and became very distraught.  It clearly looked like something had eaten my favorite girl

After searching for a while I go back only to find that my newest hen I got from a friend had cannibalized 5 of the eggs and they clearly had baby chickens inside.  

I HATE THAT FREAKING BIRD! Her name is now going to be SOUP!  Now I know why we haven't been finding many eggs since she came.  Jerky bird!  Adding insult to injury.

So I carefully scooped up the remaining 5 eggs and took them in the house and tried to keep them reasonably warm

I also thought I had something getting my chickens.  So as night approached

So, but couldn't find the third.  I knew momma made a noise for it to hide quietly. 

We put momma and her babies in a pen and looked for the last baby for a while, and collected the last baby, and now they are all safely inside a secure pen.   I also put the 5 remaining eggs in with momma and she set on them.  I don't know if it's too late though or if there is any hope or not, but I am just happy that momma wasn't eaten and that she has a couple babies!

1372640762.0,1heaxs,Two hens dead in a week. Help!,deathshower,5,1,3,"I just lost two hens within 7 days of each other

 

We had 8 laying hens, one of our girls fell sick.  She was, as best I know, about 3 years old and looked like an Australorp.  She got a droopy comb, became very lethargic, wasn't eating, and stopped laying.  I examined her and discovered that she was extremely swollen just below the vent.  I initially thought she was egg-bound, ascites due most likely to internal laying seemed more probable.  After a few days she seemed a bit perkier and I put her back in the coop.  I don't think she ever laid again, when we found her dead in the coop.

 

Sometime in May, a tough little bird.  She was fine one moment, and maybe 5 minutes later I went back out and found her lying on the floor of the coop, unable to stand or walk.  She had her legs splayed out, toes apart, legs tense and outstretched, one in front of the other almost like she was doing the splits.  She was laying on her side.  She was unable to close her toes even to grip the roost.  After an hour or so, she was fine again.  We asked the guy at our feed store about it and he suggested that maybe she had had the misfortune of eating a bug or something that had been poisoned or exposed to pesticide.  Nothing more happened

 

Then today, then this morning, she was dead.  There was a very small amount of blood around her nostrils, but no other sign of trauma.  Her legs, however, are splayed out in exactly the same manner I described above, and her neck is twisted around as though she were looking behind her or pecking something on her back between her wings.

 

I am at a complete loss for what might be going on.  I don't know if the two deaths are related or not, or neither...  

 

We considered the possibility that the barred rock experienced the same paralysis symptoms as the game hen, hosed down the coop, and put out a couple frozen 2 liter bottles. The coop is also very well shaded and ventilated, and they have an automatic waterer so they never run out of drinking water.  We've also considered the possibility that our flock is infected with some sort of disease and the game hen was able to fight it off, while the barred rock succumbed.  

 

We've been having a huge problem with wild sparrows getting in through the poultry wire and eating the chickens' feed -- I'm a little stumped on what to do about that.  I've seen people put bird netting over the poultry wire, but maybe they wouldn't if there were no readily available feed to attract them...  At any rate, I'm concerned about the possibility that the wild birds may have introduced some pathogen to my flock.  I've also noticed some signs that they may have mites -- I havent seen any actual mites, but a few of the hens --not all-- have been pecking their feathers out just above the base of their tails.  I just bought some dust at the feed store to get rid of any mites they may have.

 

I've tried to do some research online about what might be going on here but I haven't had much success narrowing it down. Chicken diseases are complicated and there's a huge amount of overlap in easily observable symptoms!  Seems like the real diagnostic criteria require lab tests and/or much more technical physical examinations than I'm qualified to do.  I'm hoping that some of you out there who have more experience with chickens than I do will have some thoughts on our little chicken mystery...  I really don't want to lose any more of my flock

 

Thank you all very much in advance!

It is not a friendly bird and doesn't like me trying to take its eggs or move it. but when i gently tip it out of its box it seems to be healthy.

Rather belatedly it's occurred to me that the thin shells might from a lack of calcium in their diet

1.  As best I can tell from its promotional video

2.  What is the average fertility rate of the eggs that are incubated?  90%?  50%?  Something in between?

3.  How many chicks can one person pack and ship per day?

Any other observations you can offer would be appreciated.  Thanks!",self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/18l0zh/a_few_questions_for_any_redditors_who_have/

My australorps and all three barred are wonderful to be around and love each other. My oldest hen named Ellonia is sweet

The EE refuse to be trained, I'll find them the first to leave the coop that way they can fly and jump around. 

I figured out one of my EE was a boy because of the feather growth. They're around 10-12 weeks old now. The white one is most likely male, what other options do I have?

I can take photos if you need them. ",self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1828su/pullet_that_refuses_to_cooperate/

Are fertilized eggs safe to eat if they're taken from the chicken the day after they're laid?

Just wondering as I'm doing a LOAD of research before I get my own... as you've probably just guessed I'm only just begun ;). Thank you!

I've been losing birds in the coop over the last 2 months - first my two silkies (one was non-violent

This morning I was out by the wood pile and I could hear the hens just going on - abnormally so. I went into the coop and found my silkie rooter bloodied on the back of the head and neck and still alive. He's in a box up in the bathroom - we'll see if he survives but I'm not hopeful. 

I have a small live trap that I can use now but frankly I have no interest in keeping this little fucker alive. Has anyone used rat traps for this kind of thing? I've read that you should bait the traps with whatever the weasel is after - so in this case

Any info would be appreciated. I won't be able to get my birds into a proper hen house until the early summer so moving them isn't an option. 

TL;DR: Help me kill a long tailed weasel that's treating my chickens like a buffet. 

ETA: My silkie roo is still alive. He's a bit sketchy and hasn't eaten / drank anything but he's still kicking in his box in the bathroom. Considering the cold snap we're about to have,False,self,t5_2sdri,1358738318.0,,,t3_16xeno
