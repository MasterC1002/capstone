Two years later, I lacked a lot of basic adult skills. After one Scientology class, I was amazed at how well presented such novel, and yet useful, concepts of life were being displayed... ready to be picked up and used.

I quickly went aboard as a staff member and was fully immersed for about 1 1/2 years. Eventually

Within a few years

Over the next decade or so

Eventually

My life has been 'interesting' since... not in the way you might suspect. I have had to come to terms with my own lack of spiritual identity

He liked it so much he tried to steer the conversation back to the program three of four times that day.  So I decided to be fair and look into it.

Turns out Second Chance Albuquerque (where the video was made) was fully funded by the New Mexico government

In a very short period of time, and the city suspected they were accepting violent offenders (they were).  The city grew concerned and examined their ""statistics,"" which turned out to be the same bogus statistics Narconon has been spreading for thirty years.  

So the city decided to evict them.  it turned out they were not just accepting violent offenders

At the time of eviction, and utilities.  They left in the middle of the night, and stole appliances and fixtures from the property.

Local news teams followed up on the program

Westrum and Pendery fled to Hawaii and tried to open a similar facility there.  Hawaii said ""No thank you.""  Joy Westrum now sells jewelry in Florida.


Strangely, ever since i showed him the fruits of my research, he's steadfastly ignored the subject of Second Chance.

She has to pay the company she works for 1000 to advance to different ""tiers"" in her workplace that they take out of her pay check gradually. Also she has been attending some kind of seminars where she learns to see color better or something like that to help with the teeth painting ostensibly. By the way

The market setup will be done by minig people with an E-Meter to create crystals that can forge different mystical weapons.  These weapons will be guns or crow bars (things you have to use to beat people up)

Spoiler
The final boss will be killing Matt Stone and Trey Parker while fending off hordes of Fans - the suprise boss will be Anon.

http://new.music.yahoo.com/chaka-khan/news/chaka-khans-son-acquitted-in-murder-trial--32151034

What are the bullet points on these guys and how do they remain a legal entity?  How does their influence in Europe differ from their influence in the US?  What are their connections to government?  What

EDIT:  More details on Khan's son's case:

1314832795.0,k0pqj,Scientologist best friend; a debate.,iSunMonkey,27,9,62,"**BACKGROUND STORY:**

Hello everybody

So here's the deal: I'm an ex-Scientologist (sort of). I never got too far into the religion before calling BS, I'm pretty familiar with the tech and how the religion works.

Anyway

I've kind of lost contact with him (more or less) since he joined the SO a few years ago. When he left

So, text, and phone. We've been catching up, reminiscing about all the stupid stuff we'd done as teenagers.

Well, and update it (if anybody cares), because we've only touched one point. It's not as much of a debate as it is an attempt at recovering me. But, I will debate every point until he stops pushing his religion on me. 

I've decided that I'm not doing him any good by pretending to agree with him, but when he finally leaves the church, he may be fucked--both financially and mentally. Even after my *brief* delving, I feel like my psyche has been kind of 'fucked with', so to speak.

**THE JUICY STUFF:**

So

&gt; *Why are your no longer a Scientologist?*

I don't agree with some of the fundamentals of Scientology. For example, I'd say we see proof for the opposite--that we *are* our bodies.

&gt; *So you need PROOF that we're spiritual beings?*

Yes. To actually validate a claim, with which I would have to agree, if I didn't use this sort of logic.

&gt; *LRH has written a lot about Theta Beings. You should read what he has to say. For example, 'The History of the Theta Line...--*

--... Sorry

&gt; *Well, so he has to consider all the pros and cons of various bridge designs. He has to consider the idea as a whole. He can't get hung up on one point of his job.*

Well, he'd have a very difficult time, because he's lacking any sort of foundation.

&gt; *Alright

... ... ...

I'm pretty proud of how this part of the conversation ended. Without my telling him to

1373429165.0,1hzi33,Self Analysis,kat8024,17,4,0,"A couple of people on this subreddit have mentioned they wouldn't mind knowing more about Scientology

As you may know

Self Analysis opens with an overview of the theory behind the exercises that come later in the book

The exercises are essentially lists of events that happen in most people's life and you trying to recall a specific sense associated with a memory of that event as clearly as possible.

 There is a list of senses on the side of each page: Sight, Color, Tone, External Motion, Emotion, Loudness, Body Position, Weight

 The idea is you you go down the list of events and apply one of the senses to that event. For instance

Can you recall a time when:
1. You were happy
2. You had just finished constructing something
3. Life was cheerful
4. Somebody had given you something
5. You ate something good
... (there are 75 items in this list

So lets pick number 1 and Sight. Try to remember what you saw one time that you were happy. Try to remember what you saw as clearly as possible. Go over the memory several times trying to remember what you saw even clearer

Eventually you will get to a point where your memory of what you saw that one time you were happy doesn't get any clearer by going over it again and then you can either move on to the next item in the list

 Don't worry about the other sense while doing it, but recalling how heavy or light your body felt, or in what position your body was in might be harder and will take some time and several times going over the memory.

There are about 230 pages of lists like the above and eventually you will get to a memory which has a lot of emotion associated with it. For instance say you get to ""Recall a time when you heard a cat mewing"" and you are working on the Emotion sense and the earliest time you remember a cat mewing was right after your father died or something. 

The theory is that trying to recall that event as absolutely clearly as possible and then going over it again and again several times in detail you will get the emotional charge off of the event.

If that's the case

For me

That's basically the whole book

 The above are my interpretations of this book and I certainly welcome comments from others who have a different interpretation - I don't claim to be an expert on this topic.",,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/1hzi33/self_analysis/

The most telling section is this:

""We are not in the business of being good boys and girls. We're in the business of going free and getting the org production roaring. Nothing else is of any interest then to Ethics but (a) getting tech in, Ethics is fascinated with his smallest misdemeanor.

In short a staff member can get away with murder so long as his statistic is up and can't sneeze without a chop if it's down.""

That last bit is actually part of the policy. I'm not paraphrasing. Hubbard doesn't mince words. He's actually saying that a Scientologist in good standing is literally exempt from the normal codes of conduct for Scientologists, you become the target of investigation yourself:

""When people do start reporting a staff member with a high statistic

This is insanity. This is a perversion of justice and ethics of a magnitude I can't even begin to articulate

This will be an update of that thread

Critiques

&gt; *Ok cool man. How are you doing?*

I'm well. I'm making music and started school yesterday. I'm taking a marketing class and an intro to cinema class. It's a full load. Plus

How's it going with you? Anything new?

&gt; *Thats really cool man

&gt; *I am doing very well. I started a course yesterday called Professinal Registration, and sometimes I couldnt recieve any sort of communication for a certain type of person. Its handled now, pretty awesome actually. I also just always say whatever is on m mind and not what I think the other person wants to hear or if I think its cool or not. Just simply more able to give, recieve and have communication.*

&gt; *I should be going back out soon. Maybe a few days and if I come back to LA we have to have lunch or something.*

Awesome. Glad you're doing well. Call me when you come out here. We should definitely get lunch. I got my car situation handled.

All the books just arrived... I could open my own org; there are so many.

Which one did you want me to read?

&gt; *Hey

I've actually read quite a bit of Dianetics.

I'm pretty busy right now. Is there a chapter you have in mind?

&gt; *No

I think there may be other reasons a person stops doing a course. For example

&gt; *Werd. Would you agree that man has aberrations and this thing called a reactive mind?*

Aberrations are insane thoughts--deviations from critical, right? Like when a child gets punished for cussing, he might scream and draw on his walls in response.

From what I remember

&gt; *Pop open the Dianetics book and in the back is a glossary.*

Ok

I think it's a possibility that man has aberrations. Though, man is very selfish and insane. Those attributes degrade when we're forced to live in proximity to one another (we make laws), or when we form a community (we elect leaders).

As far as the reactive mind, the cells and neurons that make a brain. This, from what I understand of anatomy, is the only 'mind' we have. Thoughts can be mapped and traced (though the technology involved is still somewhat primitive) on a brain by setting up electrodes in specific areas. There's an entire science revolving around understanding the intricacies of the human brain. Neurology is a branch of that science.

So, but I think that the reactive mind, and the analytical mind, are one in the same, unless you have evidence that shows otherwise.

On another note

&gt; *I am not going to tell you what to believe

&gt; *The reason I know that I am not just a body and dont live one life and then get buried is because I have had whole track recalls and seen how engrams on the track have affected my every day life. I started having these cognitions on my Tr's and Objectives

I can't disagree with your personal experiences. If it's working for you

For me, and testable foundation, I can't force myself to believe anything. There are an infinite number of possible explanations for what's going on in our universe; for what's happening in our bodies and minds; and for what happens when we die. There are answers, I'm sure. But, for now, I believe those answers aren't yet completely known. This used to trouble me, and still does occasionally. I've lost quite a bit of sleep over this eternal debate--weighing the possibilities, life

I've come to think that the only valuable commodities in life are personal experiences and happiness through those experiences. No amount of money

You dig

&gt; *Thats what I believe also. The experiencing of pleasure moments

I've had auditing with the cans. I can't remember enjoying it too much. By the way

I'm vey sure my dad won't be spending money on his account. But, dude!

**Scientology**
An example of avoiding information critical of the church:
In May, where members were told not to read the TIME article because it’s ""entheta"" (enturbulated theta - ""enturbulated"" meaning chaotic, confused and ""theta"" being the Scientology term for spirit). They were then given copies of Scientology’s 80-page ""rebuttal"" and it is incredible to think how the rebuttal would make any sense to someone who hadn’t even read the article in the first place!
 
Anyone who writes articles, a depraved, psychotic and ""fair game"" for attacks. If a Scientologist’s concerned relative showed their loved one a critical article and the person went back to Scientology and asked about it, they would be given the standard line that the article was written by a criminal and that it was all lies.

""Now, open it, and see right away that it is from an apostate? Will curiosity cause you to read it, just to see what he has to say?

A very interesting question -- a true mystery is posed: Was Scientology harassing this couple to the point that they decided death was better

If I were a stalker for a cult whose aim was to discredit and ruin someone in revenge for their non-compliance or departure from the cult, right next door, would be one favor I would do them to woo them into the cult): I would file a complaint with the police that they had been harassing me, then leak the complaint so it became public, and in the complaint I would allege something so sick and clearly mentally ill for my target to have harassed me with so as to discredit them in case they later publicly revealed my cult's unsavory activities. This is what this actual complaint said:

“On the evening of May 9, “Theresa approached my bungalow and rapped on the window. Upon opening the door I was immediately greeted with the following questions&gt;… Theresa said to me, ‘Jeremy and I have started a club where we’ve found a bunch of old men and we’re letting them fuck us in the ass, and we wanted to know if you wanted to be a part of it.’ I asked Theresa if she was joking. She said ‘no’ and repeated herself. I asked if she was trying to imply something about the age difference between my boyfriend and me.” (Schlei is 41.) “She said ‘no,’ smiled, and walked away.""

Hello

I was out a good bit of the time this past week
Number of Active Students and number of Lessons Graded were both down
two main sub-statistics that lead to our overall statistic (extension course completions).

However

**Success Story:**  Here is a recent Success Story from the Scientology 8-80 Extension Course.
           **""I did solo auditing in the past that involved dichotomies**^1 **but never truly understood them.  One chapter on this course
           blew that huge misunderstood away.**

**To say that my knowledge of life took a quantum leap with this course would be an understatement**.  **The knowledge I have
gained about what life is doing and about the source of life energy itself is priceless**.  **I have finally located myself as a source of life energy**.

**On the History of Man extension course I felt myself** '**get on board.**'   **Now I can see myself beginning to ""run the train!""**

^1 **dichotomy** - ""opposites or near opposites.  Two things which, that is a dichotomy - good and evil.
If God is just sitting there, there is lots of action.  Opposites don't have to be absolute, like God and Devil.  They can be much closer together and still form a dichotomy so that there can be an interplay.""  (from Scientology 8-80, page 67)
           
**Birthday Game**:  DC Day Org finished lower than usual for the week just ended

**Finding the positives**:  With all of the destructive individuals
         

 **As Scientologists we take our hope and gain purpose for what we do to change things, you find that Man is basically good and it is only his aberrations that cause him to do evil**.  **And elsewhere in that book, we learn where those aberrations come from and how to get rid of them**.

**These truths become obvious to those of us who have experienced the results of Dianetics auditing (counseling)**

 **So,False,,t5_2qh3a,1341586134.0,,,t3_w4p4c

**Where are the female students**?  **None active this week.**

COMPLETIONS:  [redacted] - Science of Survival            **[redacted]** - **The Problems of Work**   -  That's right.  [redacted] started and completed the course in less than one week.

THE BIRTHDAY GAME.  **DC day finished in second place internationally for the week just ended**, **but we want first place**, **so keep those lessons coming in please**.

THE THREE BIG EVENTS:  

These are powerful events that no Scientologist will want to miss.  Even if you don't consider yourself a Scientologist, **the family**, **the nation and other groups**, **all of mankind**, **plants and animals and the very planet we live on**.  

**The second event (on July 24) will give many a much deeper sense of hope**

A POEM TO LIVE BY:

There once was a student with confusions galore
He simply wanted to study no more.

Then he began using the glossary in the back of the book.
Whenever there was a confusion

until he found the word or words that were holding him back
and when he found them he would go on the attack

using them in sentences until they made full sense.
A clear happy feeling was his recompense.

Then he would head with a bound
back to the passage where the misunderstood word had been found.

Lo and behold
and reading his book was a new-found joy.

So that is the story of the student who once found study confusing.
He now enjoys study and he's no longer losing.",,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/zogqs/back_from_the_rpf_heres_a_poem/

I've recently been curious about the Church of Scientology and also about mr. Hubbard himself and I was wondering what book I should read if I wanted to get info on the church. I'm not simply looking for a book describing Scientology

Does Scientology use LRH's novels directly as the foundation for their teachings or is it simply a set of rules and guidelines that are merely based off them?

Dear Steve

You will have received a letter from our lawyers in relation to a confidentiality agreement in place between the Church and Valeska Paris. 

Without prejudice to the Church’s rights arising under the confidentiality agreement and in view of the intended broadcast

Put bluntly

Valeska left the ship hundreds of times to go shopping, as well as for numerous other reasons while aboard. In 2001, she hosted six members of her husband’s family. She participated in extended projects in the UK, US and Denmark. She certainly wasn’t “forced” to be there. She was also never forced to perform labor in the engine room. 

The Freewinds is a wonderful place

Any decision Valeska made with respect to whether she communicated with her mother was her decision alone. This is a fact supported by documentation. 

Valeska was one of thousands of members of the Sea Organization, however her certificates were cancelled for violations of the Auditor’s Code. 

As to the allegations concerning Mr. Miscavige

Valeska started a relationship with Chris Guider (another unreliable source) and chose to leave the Sea Organization to have a baby. She left the Church on amicable terms and the Church gave her assistance to set up her new life

That she now is attacking her former religion and former friends and fabricating these stories speaks volumes about her. She is a true apostate.
 
So there is no doubt as to our position: Valeska is lying to you. She is an unreliable source. It would be wholly irresponsible for Lateline to broadcast these spurious and uncorroborated claims. It would do so at its own risk.

Your source is doing this because she and Chris Guider apparently cannot get their life in order and move on. For them

Best regards,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,t3_mtfmt

*But there is more to this: science fiction, of course, speak for my friends of that period. But from Campbell and from “shooting the breeze” with other writers of the time, one got the very solid impression that they were doing a heavy job of beating the drum to get man to the stars.*

*At the beginning of that time

*Campbell’s crew of writers were pretty stellar. They included very top-liner names. They improved the literary quality of the genre. And they began the boom of its broader popularity.*

*A year or so after the golden age began, I was shaking a lot of hands held out below beaming faces. And what did they want to know: What did I think of this story or that? And had I seen this or that writer lately? And how was Campbell?*

*They had a literature! Science fiction!*

*And they were proud of it!*

*For a while, the boys who built the bomb, who were beginning to get the feel of rockets. They were all science fiction buffs. And many of the hottest scientists around were also writing science fiction on the side.*

*In 1945 I attended a meeting of old scientist and science fiction friends. The meeting was at the home of my dear friend

*One can’t go on living a naive life believing that everything happens by accident, kismet, and we’re back in the world of fantasy. No, things do get planned.*

*The golden age of science fiction that began with Campbell and Astounding Science Fiction gathered enough public interest and readership to help push man into space. Today


*The golden age of science fiction that began with Campbell and Astounding Science Fiction gathered enough public interest and readership to help push man into space.*
	
*Campbell did what he set out to do. So long as he had his first wife and others around him to remind him that science was for people, too, he kept winning. For he was a very brilliant man and a great and very patient editor. After he lost his first wife, Doña, in 1949 – – she married George O. Smith – – and after he no longer had a sounding board who made him keep people in stories, and when he no longer had his old original writing crew around, he let his magazine slip back, his reign was over. But the golden age had kicked it all into high gear. So Campbell won after all.*",t5_2qh3a,True

Scientific paper published Feb 2010 in the New England Journal of Medicine:

[Willful Modulation of Brain Activity in Disorders of Consciousness](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa0905370)

[Webpage detailing the Unconscious Person Assist](http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_9.HTM)

Often scientologists will see things like this as validating Scientology. 

YMMV

just for the record

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Oriented_Coma_Work

*Coma work begins with the attitude that the comatose patient is capable of perceiving and relating to outer and inner experience

*Channels of communication may be identified by noticing small, facial expressions, and vocalization by the patient. The coma worker then attempts to interact with the patient by interacting with and amplifying these signals.*

*During the interaction, perhaps adding a bit of extra modulation, the patient may respond by changing his or her own vocalization. In addition, the coma worker may attempt to set up a ""binary"" communication link, inviting the patient to use available movement, like the movement of an eyelid or a finger, to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to questions.*

which compares with the original Scientology technique.

Thus we see that there are techniques in Scientology that can get results

brings up some of the personal dilemmas this creates for people:

*As if confirming this, we asked the question: If your Dad can only communicate through ‘thought MRI’ like patients in this study, would you consider him alive?*
