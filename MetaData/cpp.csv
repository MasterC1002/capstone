I had a C++ phone screen and I thought some people might be interested in seeing the questions that were asked. Here they are:

If you could change one thing about the C++ language

Could you explain to me how virtual functions work? and why you would use them?

What is the overhead of calling a virtual function?

Are there any situations when this overhead is larger or smaller?

When should you make a destructor virtual?

Could you explain to me the difference between static_cast and dynamic_cast?

How would you implement a class that opens two files if you could not use exceptions?

How would you implement that class with two files using exceptions?

How would you handle one of the files failing to open in the case where you have exceptions?

Could your constructor throw an exception after one of the files had been opened and the 2nd one failed? Which destructors would be called in this case? (assumes use of RAII for file handling (which is how I answered the previous questions))

How would you find the 10 most used words used in a large text file (which was a novel)? file -&gt; words -&gt; hashmap&lt;string word

I'm reading a line from an input.ini file. I need to check and see if the first character is a *

Here is a sample input.ini:

*Some sort of comment

42 102

It seems I should use getline and check if the first character is *

for example:


ifstream infile(""input.ini"");
string s;
int N1

getline(infile

if (s[0]!='*'){
  s &gt;&gt; N1 &gt;&gt; N2;

tl;dr: Signal to noise is getting low. Can we do something about it?

Lets get down to business. /r/cpp isn't a huge subreddit. Of late, however, I feel that posting these questions to /r/cpp is misplaced, especially since it is such a (relatively) small community. I vote that these sorts of posts to /r/cpp should be discouraged in general and redirected to a site more suited to helping people with questions, such as stackoverflow.com. Anecdotally, per-capita, users are much more likely to find real answers to their questions about c++ on stack overflow than reddit

Reddit's original purpose was as a news aggregation website. I know that, only an intention, and that reddit has outgrown this to become a sort of community. I support the community aspect as well, in the general sense. However, I feel that straying too far from this original intention is detrimental to reddit as a whole, and that /r/cpp has strayed or will stray too far.

Take /r/hardware (28.5k redditors subscribed)

86/100, self.tech, and self.networking, respectively. These posts aren't news. These posts aren't community. This is abuse. Most of these posts have less than 10 replies, and since this is still reddit, how many of those are acutal answers to the OP's question? I don't even mean the silly memes and youtube-style comments. Most of these replies are baseless opinions that serve only to increase the noise-to-signal ratio. They do not help the OP. IMHO, this is unacceptable

I'm using Visual Studio 2013, but VS will alert you in the output window when you've left objects alive, so that helps.

I don't really use any of the C++11 smart pointers right now (I'm much more focused on the DirectX bits of my engine working)

What about memory management within functions? e.g. if I create a std::ostringstream inside a function, an ID3D11Device)?

    v.push_back(v.front() );

Now, but those explicitly *don't* invalidate references.

How ever that might be, so that I think it should be pointed out more clearly.

The details are as follow:

In case of the vector ""running over"", the existing items are copied over and the old buffer is then deallocated. At that time, the reference will be invalid. Now, there are 2 cases:

1. The value object has a destructor that does some real cleanup

2. The value object is some kind of plain data, what exactly happens. To make a long story short, since modern platforms feature an MMU, this could raise an exception. Or you could be ""lucky"", that the standard library or OS is a little slower, which means that you will be allowed one more time to read the data even after deallocation.

In case of insert, you will either read the wrong value or a deconstructed value.

So this is it. Maybe all of this is completely clear to you and you would never make such a mistake. But my experience shows that this error can be made more easily, so the warning that iterators get invalidated seems to not apply to this case. It is especially nasty, because there are possible combinations where it is literally impossible to reproduce the problem on your development machine, but it will randomly crash on some other machine, maybe only once in a while.

EDIT: this also applies to std::deque and its push_front() function.

&gt;Trivia : idTech4 high level objects are all abstract classes with virtual methods. This would normally involves a performance hit since each virtual method address would have to be looked up in a vtable before calling it at runtime. But there is a ""trick"" to avoid that. All object are instantiated statically on the heap as follow:

        
        
    idCommonLocal    commonLocal;                   // Implementation
    idCommon *       common = &amp;commonLocal;         // Pointer for gamex86.dll
        
        
&gt;Since an object allocated on the heap has a known type the compiler can optimize away the vtable lookup. The interface pointer is used during the handshake so doom3.exe can exchange objects reference with gamex86.dll. 


I don't really understand how this actually optimizes the vtable lookups away.  Could someone shed some light on it for me?  Thank you.",,t5_2qi27,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/x3bqg/doom_3_vtable_trick/

I wanna find out if your expericnce of working as a C++ programmer is anything like mine.

I have changed jobs lots mostly because I got stuck working in messy code bases. The  people I worked with have not been interested in reading any of the C++ best practices books. Its like

I think being a good c++ programmer isn't about memorizing syntax, efficient, and safe code. And that is something you just wont learn in the trenches, no matter how long you have been there, but something you have to pick up by studying best practices books.

It seems to me there is mostly low quality code out there, best practices and gotchas. But I know what ugly code looks like and always trying to improve by studying the books.

**So I got a few questions: Do you think being a good C++ programmer means reading lots of C++ books? Do you think most C++ code out there is ugly and most C++ programmers are a bit bad. What is your experience?**

The reason I'm asking is because I'm changing jobs again.. but it will probably just be more of the same. Is all companies like this? Or is there some industry or some types of companies that care more about code quality than others?

Some definitions:

*Good code* as in: RAII, short methods, STL algorithms, unit tests, data hiding, composition before inheritance, do-as-the-int's, pimpl's

*Bad code* as in: huge classes, C style code (polymorfism by void pointers, casting, and type switches), goto, reiventing wheels, macros, etc

1343173617.0,x3o9z,PSA: The Most Vexing Parse,jjt,43,6,6,"From Wikipedia [Most vexing parse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse):

&gt; The most vexing parse is a specific form of syntactic ambiguity resolution in the C++ programming language. The term was used by Scott Meyers in Effective STL (2001).[1] It is formally defined in section 6.8 of the C++ language standard.

A simple example:

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    struct A {
    };

    struct B {
        B(A a) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""B ctor\n"";
        }
    };

    int main() {
        B b(A());
        return 0;
    }

You might think this code should call B::B(A) and ""B ctor"" will print on stdout

    $ g++-4.7 -Wall -std=c++11 mvp.cc 
    $ ./a.out 
    $

*Wat?* Did g++ really just ignore the declaration of the variable 'b' with no warning? Well...no

To prove this

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;typeinfo&gt;
    
    struct A {
    };
    
    struct B {
        B(A a) {}
    };
    
    int main() {
        B b(A());
        std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(b).name() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        return 0;
    }

This will print the RTTI name

    $ ./a.out | c++filt -t
    B (A (*)())

Lets break this down. 'b' is declared as a function that returns type 'B' and takes a single argument that is a function pointer. The argument to 'b' is an unnamed function that returns type 'A'. Another way of writing this out would be:


    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;typeinfo&gt;
    
    struct A {
    };
    
    struct B {
    };
    
    typedef A (*afunc)();
    
    B b(afunc);
    
    int main() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(afunc).name() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        std::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(b).name() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        return 0;
    }

And we get:

    $ ./a.out | c++filt -t
    A (*)()
    B (A (*)())

The crux of the problem seems to be that C allows you to drop the

    (*)

from

    A(*)()

which is what causes B b(A()) to be interpreted as a function declaration.

How to avoid this? C++11 has a feature called [Uniform initialization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Uniform_initialization) that introduces this syntax for calling constructors

    B b{A{}};

    $ g++-4.7 -Wall -std=c++11 mvp.cc 
    $ ./a.out 
    B ctor
    $

At this point you might be tempted to change your code to always use {} instead of () when calling constructors. However

    #include &lt;vector&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    int main() {
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v1(100
        std::cout &lt;&lt; v1.size() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
    
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v2{100
        std::cout &lt;&lt; v2.size() &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        return 0;
    }

These are not the same:

    $ g++-4.7 -Wall -std=c++11 test.cc 
    $ ./a.out
    100
    2

'v1' calls the vector constructor that creates a vector of 100 items initialized to 0.

'v2' calls the constructor which takes a std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; of items to add to the vector.

Take away:

 * Be especially careful when calling constructors. Watch out for initializer_list constructors.
 * Write tests.
 * Try compiling your code with clang++ 3.1 for the diagnostics. Unlike g++-4.7
 * Remember this before submitting bugs to gcc so you don't get shamed on bugzilla.
 * Be very careful when adding initializer_list constructors to your existing classes. They will become the preferred constructor and can change the meaning of existing code that might have been calling a different constructor.

I have a question that's really been bothering me recently. I can program in c#

The thing that I find very annoying is the lack of knowledge of what makes c++ used more than the other languages. From personal experience c++ is the hardest language from all other ones i know. Instead of having 1 file per class like in java or c# you need to have 2 files per class. Instead of just having a . for accessing members of objects you have a . and a -&gt;. I could list these forever. Yet in the end it turns out that almost everything is written in c++, games, robots and even traffic lights.

I just need motivation to keep programming in c++. Please don't give me long lists of things I won't understand

A static type system is only really useful if it can provide a guarantee that a parameter or return value or member declared to be of a given type actually contains a meaningful value of that type at runtime. For many kinds of values there is no good default value (e.g. take an exception type with an error code, or take a type describing a customer, what is a meaningful default name).

I thought you guys might find this interesting. I came up with a small solution for keyword arguments using operator suffixes and variadic templates. It's not the best solution by any means

The solution allows you to write keyword arguments like:

    int main()
    {
        greet(""user""kw=""Justin"");
        greet();
    }

And use them like:

    void greet(const kwargs&amp; kw = kwargs())
    {
        int age = kw[""age""]; // default initialized values for copy semantics.
        int happiness = kw.get(""happiness""
        std::string name = kw.get(""user""
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello
    }

Here is the actual code:

    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;map&gt;
    #include &lt;memory&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    class kwarg {
    public:
        kwarg() = default;
        kwarg(const char* name)
            : name(name) { }

        struct kwarg_proxy_base { virtual ~kwarg_proxy_base() {}; };

        template &lt;typename T&gt;
        struct kwarg_proxy : kwarg_proxy_base {
            kwarg_proxy() = default;
            kwarg_proxy(const T&amp; t)
                : t(t) { }
            typedef T type;
            const T&amp; t;
        };

        kwarg&amp; operator=(kwarg&amp; rhs)
        {
            value = rhs.value;

            return *this;
        }

        template &lt;typename T&gt;

I'm a CS student with Java

Specifically I need a 2 dimensional array with different sizes that can easily be passed to different functions. 

My first taught was to do declare this as follows

    int grid [rows][columns];

    void print_grid (int **grid
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""print_grit:"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        for (int row = 0; row &lt; rows; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col &lt; columns; col++) {
                std::cout &lt;&lt; (grid[row])[col] &lt;&lt; endl;
            }
        }
    }

    print_grid(grid

But this doesn't seem to work. I went to google to search how to implement a multidimensional array and I came upon many different suggentions

So what is the best way to implement an multidimentional grid/matrix/array?

I'm writing a small library and I'm wondering whether to burden users with memory mangement or handle it on their behalf.


The jist of what I have is something like:


    IP4Address* IP4Address::GetFirstAddressInRange() {	
        ....
        IP4Address* _addr(new IP4Address(_addressString));
        _addr-&gt;netmask = this -&gt;netmask;

As you can see


The function's implementation in its entirety is at:

Been using this *stupid* trick for a while now and I'm enjoying it so much I thought I'd share.

Let's say we have this enum

    enum MyEnum
    {
        kOne
        kSecond
        kThird
        kCount
    };

we would like to be able to write

    MyEnum value = MyEnum.kOne;

and hell

Well

    namespace MyEnum
    {
        enum e
        {
            kFirst
            kSecond
            kThird
            kCount
        };
    }

You must name the actual enum ""e"" because you may want to use this specific type like in:

    MyEnum::e value = MyEnum::kFirst;

So yeah... that is all. You get Visual Assist to list the possible values for a specific enum and visually in code you get a nice scope for it too.

Enjoy (?)

It is an SI unit library. There should be little performance overhead. It correctly performs unit multiplications (Newton x Meter = Joule) there are also literal operators for the seven basic SI units

It's a header only library so all the relevant code is  in units.hpp.

Recently I've decided to start work on development of solution

Here is the announce: [MSBuild for MinGW (about the series)](http://cpp-sparkles.blogspot.com/2012/07/msbuild-for-mingw-about-series.html)

So I'm asking for several points:

* Is the idea of usage of MinGW from Visual Studio can be interested for anybody?
* Are the posts about its development may be interesting for anybody and worth posting here (or somewhere else)?
* As I'm not a native English speaker I cannot estimate the quality of my language, tell me if it is OK, not good or absolutely terrible.
