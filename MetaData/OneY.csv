I was really excited about the notion of hanging out with him alone, and I had a pretty good feeling that he was interested, too. I tried to kiss him at the end of the night, and he dodged it, telling me that he's not interested in getting involved with anyone right now. 

Fuck. It felt like shit. I went to bed that night feeling pissed off

I just wanted to say, and much of the time getting turned down. It really fucking blows.

This does not invalidate the reverse - that women also face a great deal of things that men do not. We've all got our issues. Feminism simply deals with women's lot. Not a bad thing in and of itself.

There are good feminists and bad feminists. Good atheists and bad atheists. Good civil rights leaders

Feminism has done some wonderful things! Who among us wants to go back 100 years? To a time when our mothers, wives, aunts, nieces, female friends, etc. did not have the right to vote? To open their own bank accounts? To divorce? To live an independent life? To have sex with whomever they felt like without having to *marry* them first?? I certainly don't want to go back, yikes!

And here's the good part: **In the struggle for men's liberation

For every woman who hates being sexualized by men on the street... there's a man who hates it when people automatically assume he is going to be a pervert and sexualize everything. For every woman who hates how society judges her femininity by her looks,"" his penis size, or the amount of money in his wallet.

Male frustration with women's problems getting far more attention than men's is understandable. But the solution is not to beat down the women's movement

Men of OneY: *Learn* about why our sisters feel the need to be ""feminists."" I have learned a lot by listening - and it doesn't diminish my conviction that men's issues are truly getting passed over. I have also found that I get a better hearing [among those who don't yet agree] when I speak out about male issues *without* resorting to bashing women or feminism.

I'm a white guy, affectionate, and really really fine. She's hot.

We were at a bar yesterday with some of her co-workers. It was really divey, with more men than women. Hmm, noted.

So we get to having fun and getting drinks. Eventually, she snuggled up to me in the booth, I put my arm around her, and we started having some quality alone time.

That's when things started getting a little iffy.

Now, with a white guy could piss some black dudes off.

""I might

Two minutes later

I talked to my girl later, ""Why are you doin' this?"" meaning, why are you dating this white guy? He grilled her about it for a minute, and then tried to give her his card. She refused it.

Have any of you guys ever dealt with this sort of thing?

So, you might inadvertently ""hurt"" her (physically) and thus risk being seen as a perpetrator of violence (e.g. If you literally have to shove a woman to get her away from you so she turns around and, I dunno, tells her friends you assaulted her)?

So I started a relationship with a girl in college about a year ago. We got along well, pushing her up a flight of stairs, and dragging her by her arm to her room. We continued to fight all night until we both fell asleep out of exhaustion. Next morning she had bruises on her arm, and I felt horrible and promised nothing like that would ever happen again (and I have not laid a hand on anyone since then). During sex she would sometimes ask for things to stop. And I would stop but only very upset that she would ""not let me finish"" and I would always complain and make her feel bad for wanting sex to stop. I would get mad at her for wanting sex to stop. And essentially put her in the position of comforting me because she felt uncomfortable during sex.

Now after graduation we decided to break up cause I am abroad for a year on a fellowship. We have kept on talking though, at which point I called her back and apologized. She answered and said we could talk about it in the morning. When we chatted in the morning it lead to me blaming her for what happened. Saying that I pushed sex on her because she was being flirty with me and I told her ""fuck you"" when she said she was done talking with me. Now she certainly does not want to talk to me and is saying that she is noticing their is an abusive patter in our interactions.
I am an abusive boyfriend. And thinking back to a relationship I had in high school there was one time I got angry with my girlfriend at the time for not giving me a blow job. It lead to a huge fight during which I by mistake locked myself and her out of my house with the car keys inside. And cause we where in a secret relationship I had to break a window to get back into the house so no one would know we where together.

People. I need help. Where do I go to seek help about being abusive in my relationships. I like to think of myself as a very intelligent, gentle, and loving person. But I think seeing myself in this way has made it harder for me to notice my own pattern of abusive actions. I cannot live as someone who is emotionally, sexually, and on occasions physically abusive towards the people that I claim to love and swear to protect. Do any of you have advice? What should I do? Where can I seek help?

I am scared at the person I have become. And I am especially afraid of that my disregard for my partner during sex could lead to me raping the person I am with. I want to stop this pattern before I hurt more people that I am close to.

My wife told me today she wants to separate - mainly because we violently disagree on how to deal with my extremely entitled

Some background: She's my highschool sweetheart

We can never ask him to do anything without a fight. Help around the house, be nice to his siblings, etc. At his best, he rolls his eyes, makes what we call ""wolf eyes"" at us, ignores us, pretends to misunderstand us, and there are a couple more around the house. He once slammed our car door open so hard when we pulled into the garage during an argument, and there are now deep gashes in the wood of the door. He threatened to kill his 2 year old brother twice for going into his (open

He is constantly banging, throwing stuff, stomping around, slamming things when he is angry. He's just generally entitled and doesn't think he should have to do any of the things we ask him to do.

We have taken him to counseling, he doesn't care about his homework, always does the minimum necessary, etc.

Okay, just let him do his thing ""because confronting him makes it worse"", and ""makes him angrier"", and ""causes contention"". If I tell him, ""You will *not* speak to your mother that way"", she will usually stop me from correcting him. She says that she thinks that I speak too harshly too him. I never yell, but I sometimes do speak sternly

Anyway... we've been fighting about this since forever. He's been like this since he was about 2 years old. Due to the job I had at the time, and if he threw a tantrum about doing something, she would just let him be. That's how we got to this point.

Anyway, being disrespectful, etc., etc., and I sat him down on the couch and started sternly telling him that his whole attitude about life was backward, and he needed to adjust his outlook if he was going to be happy, that disrespect would not be tolerated, etc. He of course reacts by being an ever bigger smartass, etc. 

After he went upstairs, since the last one was born) we should probably separate. She told me she doesn't want her kids treated like they're in the military, etc, etc. It's completely ridiculous. Again, I wasn't yelling, I was speaking sternly to a kid who was being extremely disrespectful.

Anyway... I don't know what's going to happen. She took the kids off to church

[Here is the thread in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/119fjl/fellow_ladies_do_you_mind_lots_of_body_hair_on_an/)

Every bit of marketing that I've seen since I was a kid has shown me men with hairless bodies

I've made many google searches only to find hairless men:

* male models - shirtless surprisingly often
* condom ads - rarely including pictures of shirtless men
* beer ads - same as condoms
* razor ads - I was thinking of leaving these out
* fire fighter calendars - stereotypical male soft porn
* romance novel covers - I was expecting every image to be filled with hairy men

I would also like to add that I have been ashamed of my body hair ever since puberty, trimmed it, etc.  I would be waxing it now if it wasn't for the price and pain involved.  I have worn shirts with high collars to hide it, thinking everyone would be repulsed by it.

And now, I am impressed that these constant images have seemingly little effect on women's desires.

Many ""Take Back the Night"" marches have specifically excluded men or have insisted that men remain separate from the front of the march. They frequently speak at length about male rape culture while ignoring the fact that men are raped too. And on the rare occasion that male rape *is* discussed

On ""Love Your Body Day"" many groups will focus on how media destroy the ability of women to feel secure within their own bodies while ignoring the effect of Calvin Klein ads

I'll admit up front that being a victim of rape or having an eating disorder is less common among men -- but that doesn't mean that these things don't exist

Many men have struggled with their body image and/or eating disorders, sadly, frequently similar to the approach taken when it comes to male rape. Because of the propagation of the idea that men think solely about sex, and that all of our actions are oriented around having sex (an idea propagated not only by mainstream culture, but also by many men and self-described feminists), the idea of a man being raped seems foreign to the vast majority of people: ""You can't *rape* a *man*! Men *always* want sex!"" Or, ""But he had an *erection*! It wasn't rape! He *wanted* it!""

So I've been having a lot of issues recently with my... rectum. I use the bathroom for four or five times a day, there's blood.

But no matter how many times I wipe, and that scent follows me around. I know others can smell it and I die everytime. The worst part is it happens at work most frequently, where I am at my most vulnerable.

I don't understand. It's like my rectum just... leaks. Simply by virtue of wearing pants, and no matter how thoroughly I wipe. It's like the simple act of sweating is a guarantee that I'll turn into the most toxic human being to be around. No one has said anything, but... I can tell. It's so bad that I can only wear a pair of jeans once before it needs to be washed (most people tell me jeans can go months without washing), and sometimes they're ruined.

I can't handle it anymore. I had a system of shitting five times a day and wiping with those wet baby wipes to guarantee a clean wipe, eating more, and nothing has helped. No matter what, I am guaranteed to leak shit. I've always had issues, ever since I was young, with keeping myself clean. It's an incredible source of pain, humiliation, no matter how hard I tried

The thing is, you'll see me touch on it. When I was a child, I had diarrhea, and was pretty much raped for it. I was told that there was nothing worse I could have done than pooping in my pants and in the toilet as much as I did; my dad pushed my face into the toilet water and shouted 'this was inside of you! all of this disgusting stuff came out of you!', and then he used a toy I had to uh... 'forcefully plug me up' so that nothing would ever come out again.

So, so the thought of going to a doctor is absolutely, utterly *paralyzing*. I keep hoping that there's something I can do on my own to avoid that humiliation, but it's getting to the point where there's nothing left for me to do.

If I'm awake, and sweat into my underpants, no matter what measures I take to stop it.

I...

I don't know what you'll do for me. I just need direction.

&gt;**Edit:** First, but you are all wonderful people. 

&gt;Secondly

&gt;I was afraid that if I went to the doctor, medical opinion on the exact state of my depravity, hanging out in my medical records for anyone to see. But the case for 'major health concern' has been successfully made, and my New Year's Resolution is to stop cutting corners.

So on Tuesday, I had heard she was pregnant. She never contacted me so I just assumed it was from someone she met right after me. Apparently there was one other guy, a possible father, but he's since taken a paternity test and he was not the father. Our relationship was pretty bad and I guess she wanted to wait until there was no doubt in her mind that I am the father. We've been talking the last few days trying to figure out a course of action, tomorrow we're going to do a paternity test and whatnot. 
I met him today, she and I talked. I respect the way she's been parenting him which is really good. I'm in shock still. Of course we haven't done the paternity test yet but I am 99.9999% sure he's mine. The timing adds up, placing time of conception the month we broke up. There was just this instinctual feeling of fatherhood I felt while holding him. If we prove he's my son I am choosing to be in his life and I want to work towards joint custody. I keep thinking about how I didn't see his first steps or hear his first word, I've missed so much already but at the same time I know he won't even remember anything from this age later on.

The teacher would go on and ask the class whether a woman could be any of these things. Usually, they would unanimously agree that this day in age, a woman could be strong, brave and a provider. The teacher would then ask only the male students what characteristics would make them a man around their peers. It would take the guys a little bit before comfortably answering, but the answers were always around ""being a 'player', not being afraid of anything regardless of how stupid, of what I believe

Here on reddit, ""If you're a guy, and you find this attractive, fuck you"", the top comment was ""There's a difference from what I find attractive and what I would fuck..."" And many males commented back saying ""I would not fuck her, I don't find her attractive at all."" They were attacked by other males, with pictures of the meme fat WoW guy, ""Hey! If you don't want to fuck these chicks then you are obviously a fat foreveralone!"" What the hell is up with that? I get that it's reddit and you're not suppose to disagree with the hivemind

Another recent post about a guy who was doing a lot of googling for a perfect engagement ring for his girlfriend. He said that google ads were starting to show a lot of diamond ring ads

So, as a female, I'm not exactly affected by it, but as males are you pressured by these ideas? Does it make it harder to be who you'd really like to be as a person?

I don't really know what started it in truth, she stays at home. Usually she sleeps in with our youngest until between 9 and 10. I get up at 5:30. I would like to go to sleep, or at least get headed that direction around 10. If I'm still trying to get to bed at 11 I start to get stressed out, knowing I'll be tired the next day. 

She doesn't like going to bed that early for the most part. She says that's the only time we get to connect. She says lately we are just coexisting and that I don't really connect with our one-year-old.

I play games with my daughter, teach her things, dance to music with her. My wife usually takes that time to get things done. I don't think she really sees what we do for the most part. Last night it escalated. I told her I wanted to get to bed, she sulked and didn't want to talk. I forced the issue and it boiled over into an argument with her essentially telling me it's all mine and my mom's fault. (Lots of context here I'll have to leave out. They struggle in their relationship, as I do with my mom. She's nosy and opinionated but has been trying lately to improve.)

We went to bed without talking after that, not able to sleep anyway. This morning she was cold. That makes me mad, I guess. I didn't say anything but I don't know what to do. I feel like it is always me who acquiesces and makes up with an apology. She rarely apologizes. I feel like as a father and a dad I should bear the brunt so we can move on. I feel like the more I type this out, the more I'll do that again and just apologize and try to think of something to make us connect and make her feel like I'm paying attention and give her some special care.

Only now do I admire the fact that he accomplished so much by himself

But since the time he was really sick and hospitalized

Three months before he died, I was lucky though and found some patrolling police-officers and they arrested them. We went to the police department, and damn, right then it just hit me... I have no idea what I'm doing or what I am supposed to do... I may be getting myself into deeper trouble right now, who knows if these guys are part of a gang or whatever, and maybe someone will follow me to my house when I leave the station later. I didn't know if I was supposed to press charges or just leave without doing anything. I just froze for a moment. A police officer helped me at the end and told me that I had to testify, if I wanted these guys to face court some day, if my father was there.

Later, asking for tech-support. I had to go over to his place and fix a hell of a mess that was going on at the client's PCs. That client was a long-time friend of my father, they had been working together from the time my father had initially started his whole business. Everything was going well, until some point where the guy just snapped and started going psycho about the mess that was going on. Long-story-short he treated me like shit, and I just felt helpless about this whole situation. I left just thinking how different things would be if my father was alive. I could turn to him and ask at least what I could have done to respond to this madness that took place earlier.

Many events like this one took place thgoughout the later years. With some situations I just learnt how to cope with. With others I still struggle to find a way to respond properly.

But yesterday night I just lost my shit completely. I went back to zero. While driving through an unknown neighborhood, the other guy's car had some minor damage... But damn, out of the other guy's car steps out the guy's 10-12 year old daughter, just like my sister, scared, shaken and crying. She wasn't hurt or anything but damn that picture just fucked me up really bad. I could have killed her, if things went different. I asked about a thousand times sorry to the guy for everything. Random passengers went near to the him and started comforting him and telling him that it's my fault (which it was and I already knew), I, ""For how long have you been driving?""

God... I didn't know what to do. I had no one to call. Nobody. I didn't want to call anybody. No friend could help me
I was the one supposed to be a man at this point and know what to do

I'm still terribly shaken after all this. Everything worked out all right at the end with the accident

I just needed to let this all out and know if any of you have felt this way or similar

My boyfriend was sexually abused as a young child by men. He revealed this to me several months into our relationship. I highly suspect that I may be the only person he has told about this.

It is still, and it has impacted how he views masculinity. There's a huge amount of self-hatred. He really sees male sexual behaviour as being aggressive, demeaning, etc. He's uncomfortable initiating sex in case he is ""forcing me"" into things, and he feels like he would be ""talking me into it"". He is extremely hesitant and requires an awful lot of coaxing to express even the most basic desires because he is so worried about being the aggressive man. For the record, he is an extremely placid person. 

Outside the bedroom he enjoys traditionally masculine pursuits, he is very uncomfortable with his masculinity. He worries a lot about hurting or coercing me, and finds it very difficult to understand why I would be attracted to him as a man. He is uncomfortable with his body.

As we are all aware, because our culture refuses to accept men as victims. He has really internalised this idea that male sexuality is predatory and creepy. Furthermore, he thinks that he does not deserve the same recognition that female victims would get BECAUSE he is male. Does anyone have any advice for me? How do I help him? Are there any victims here who feel comfortable sharing with me?

Also, I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

-------------------------------------------------------------- 

This is something I've been thinking over for the past few weeks and I'd like to guage you guys and girls thoughts. 

I'm still keenly interested in men's rights and do still feel that men are disadvantaged in many areas both socially and in legislation. I enjoy discussing the subject

What I dislike about the MR movement at the moment is the aggressive anti-feminism rhetoric. Personally, the attitude of ""fuck feminism"" only serves to further entrench members of both social movements. The fact is that there are many places where women are still disadvantaged and we should offer our support to them in these causes.

I hate that the ""Us vs Them"" mentality even exists

Over the past century we have come leaps and bounds, and this requires co-operation and not hostility. 

For this reason I do not call myself a Men's Rights Activist

I'm sitting here drinking a beer and watching Mad Men

My father was the youngest of 8 in a very Catholic family in a reasonable Midwestern town. He never really talked about his childhood that much, mostly his older sisters.

After watching Mad Men and reading up on some other era history

As for my childhood, were never really taught how to be men. My father tried to teach us in his own way but it never really seemed like he knew what to do with us. My brother and I turned out alright. We're both successful in our own rights and have never been disrespectful to women or elders or the like. But I can't help but think that since my dad had such a shotty father he had to figure out how to be a man on his own, and that kind of passed down to my brother and I.

Now that I'm out of college, I can't help but have these musings and wonder about who my grandfather was, who my greatgrandfather was, and how my uncles were raised.

So
As a question: How was your father and/or grandfather raised? How does that compare to how you were raised? How does that make you reflect on your childhood and does it offer any insight into who you are and/or how you want to (or do) raise your kids?

p.s. I realize that the beer might have something to do with the length of this post. A few beers + musings + reddit = long post.

**TL;DR : Grandfather died when my father was young and my father and I weren't really taught how to be a man. Have you ever considered how your father's upbringing has affected your own?**

This experience also makes me want to never tell anyone anything ever again.

Spent most of my school years as bit overweight

After high school I started being less active and started eating out more. At my heaviest I was 235 lbs

So I started working out and eating less. I started getting compliments on my weight loss. With that motivation, and coworkers stopped complimenting me and started telling me I was losing too much weight. A close friend of mine finally told me that I wasn't allowed to lose any more.

So I read up on how apparently the most effective way to burn fat is to build muscle. I start a weight-training program and loosely follow a bodybuilder diet. I'm looking for signs of being ""toned"", but I'm a far cry from what I once was. I was never trying to get big or muscular, just wanted to tone up a bit.

So, and her response was essentially ""That's weird"" and that was that. In retrospect, I'm not sure why I was so nervous. She has no interest in reading it, and everything is fine. 

Now the ex. She called and we talked for over an hour. She had called all her exes who are in the book but left me for last. My name and description are changed, as they take place a decade ago and I wasn't a great boyfriend at 19-20. She explained that I was the first person to break her heart, something I knew deep down but never really thought about. She also flattered me, writing that I was the most gorgeous man she had ever seen (at that time, I have a beer belly now) and telling me that she still has a piece of jewelry that I gave to her back then.

All in all, she was pretty psycho to deal with, so it's not all one sided. And the book is humorous, so as much as she digs at me she digs at herself equally so.

1313992306.0,jqbvt,I just told my wife that our lack of passion (sex) has me depressed and feeling undesired at the age of 30.,libidotomahtoe,97,18,87,"Obvious throwaway account.

We've been married for 4 years, I feel like all the confidence and self-esteem I've built over the years is gone.

I feel like I've lost my mind.

I'll start from the beginning. 

My wife is a lovely women, truly kind and loving individual. She loves to cook, is an artist, collects simple beautiful things and we've traveled extensively together.

I come from a very sexually active background. I've fought with low self-esteem all throughout my formative years yet still ended up in the bed of 42 women. By all accounts, I came across this girl. Wasting no time in locking that down.

I've learned so much in the years we've been together. I look back now and realize that I was a wreck in need of positive influence and good old fashioned love. (I come from your quintessential broken home/ alcoholic driven after school specials). I've always taken pride in my ability to articulate and present myself with dignity and respect. After all

I under no circumstances take my position in life, a clean, nice humble home, and a well stocked fridge for granted. By all accounts, many would call this a first world problem but please understand, I am aware of all this yet still am confused and in need of other men to help me through this.

We have sex on what seems like a 6 week rotation. I take care of 'business' everyday 5 times a week. I am near insatiable. Porn has only desensitized me and now I need penguins fucking midgets to really get the juices flowing. In all seriousness

That fundamental passion, in no uncertain terms are you desired even more than this one, perfect moment.

The way her eyes draw you into that state of disassembled fury and lust

Looking back

Sex is awkward for her. There are two positions. On her stomach and spoon. Everything else hurts her, have conversations trying to align and the mood gets buried under the act of push, pull, push, pull. There is no passion.

This choreography is constant. I have not lain between a womans thighs only to slide into her want without a small fight. The lack of lust and instant take and fuck and drive is listless and I've had a bit of a breakdown over it.

I work in a very public place, quick vision of me driving from behind, it's her caressing me, pulling me in, whispering in my ear. It's us driving to the mountains, laughing and fucking all the way, swimming in secluded rivers and catching the darted looks across a shop in anticipation for our next moments alone.

I've fought these ideas in the face of absolute possibility, blatant demands (the third does not attract me in the slightest - I enjoy subtlety) and this last one, the subtlety is what gets me.. am I after the chase again? Because honestly, at this junction in my 4 weeks of discombobulation, I haven't the heart nor the absence of anxiety to fight my own obsessions let alone the games that come with this territory.

I know many of you will cast this aside as just another lust scenario and you know what, your perspective. I'm NOT just thinking about other women, I'm having a need fulfilled in a very intimate way with these desires that I no longer, if ever, got from my wife and tonight, I told her.

I told her all the above and she interrupted to defend her position without me finishing what the problem was. I told her there was a lack of passion and her response was

I made it very clear how she dwarves these other women in her love, character and devotion to our marriage and that this is only one aspect of our marriage that I am having trouble with. That I am becoming an unused stock horse at 30. 

I feel undesired by my spouse. Completely, I melt in a a way I haven't in years.

Do you feel that porn (we're talking production-value Brazzers kind of stuff

What sort of role do you see it playing in relationships? Do you think it is damaging to how relationships form? 

Do you think the monetization and commodification of something as intimate as sex is ultimately a moral failing? 

Does it have an effect on how we view sexual orientation and promiscuity?

I realize this is a bit of an open-ended question

I'll share my opinions in a bit.

**edit for some input

I have found that the battle over pornography and its place in society is ultimately much more damaging to our view and understanding of sexuality than even the most debasing porn could ever possibly be. It reveals the anxiety that we experience socially in regards to sexual activity in its most stark terms

I have discovered a masturbation double-standard. Women who buy vibrators are seen as adventurous, lonely, and incapable of finding a mate. I have seen couples enter the store with the intent of purchasing a vibrator for the girl, and when her boyfriend jokingly suggests a stroker, it is almost invariably met with the response ""I should be enough for you"". Perhaps it is a reflection of the typical view of The Elusive Female Orgasm and The Undiscerning Male Erection. Perhaps it's an entrenched anxiety about masculinity. This manifests in attitudes about porn in that pornography is the last vestige of the Sad and the Desperate. I think this view is inherently harmful; as people hit puberty and their hormones go nuts, a social anxiety about pornography will lead him to take increasingly risky and potentially harmful behavior as a means of venting that pent up sexuality (which leads hand-in-hand into the abstinence and abortion debates, which I'll leave for another day).

A common critique of pornography is that it objectifies women in a harmful way. I will not argue that this is the case (after all, men are often denied even a face. In porn, they are nothing more than a dick and maybe a pair of hands. Some might argue that this is also the point, that men in male-targetted porn are little more than avatars, for the viewer to project himself into it. I understand the argument, but I reject it on the grounds that I still believe that dehumanization is harmful to both genders.

Another common critique is how pornography damages an individuals view of intimacy and romance. ""Our children will grow up with unrealistic expectations of sex!"" This, and reveals an inability for us to have a conversation. Your kid will only grow up with unrealistic expectations of sex and relationships if you *don't try to counter what they're seeing in porn*. As long as you continue to avoid having an honest discussion and insist on pushing that duty off on your schools and pro-abstinence special interest groups, your kid is going to grow up with an unrealistic expectation of sex. And that is not a failing of porn, that is a failing of parenting. It'd be like lamenting that your kid only speaks in lolspeak, but have never enrolled them in an English class. 

There is a concept in porn called 'Gay for Pay'

There was a photo that hit the front page a few weeks ago of a guy in Australia watching porn at work. Someone felt the need to take a photo of it

I believe the best kind of porn is the porn made for free. People who film themselves fucking on their cell phone and upload it to the internet; these are the people who are into it, and very few are actually enjoying what they're doing. I think that attitude in itself is also fairly damaging.

**tl;dr**: Porn itself isn't inherently harmful, resulting in a feedback loop that drags us all down with it. 

It pleases me to see that this sentiment seems to be the general consensus.

Now

**Can we fix it?**

I love being able to express my traditional masculine aspects; it's something people take for granted sometimes.

So, I love being one of the guys. None of us are ignorant or the type to crush beer cans on our forehead, so idk what she was talking about other than maybe us fitting a stereotype.

**tl, made straight bro friends, love feeling like one of the guys, but soem girl told me that fist bumping degrades me. Thoughts?

**EDIT** wow. To clarify, is it's been so long since the exchange, that I don't think she would even remember. It was seriously like a year ago. I don't know why it popped into my head today, but it did. She is my friend and a good person, don't just jump down her throat with all sorts of assumptions about women and feminism.

The story thus far:

3 years ago I was informed that I am a father. My ex had decided that I was too young and never informed me that I had a daughter. She also didn't want my daughter so she gave my daughter to her aunt to raise and that is where my daughter now resides. My daughter was 10 at the time of me finding out. 

I spent the next 2 years gradually getting to know my daughter and building a relationship. She used to glow talking about me. My daughter would call every Sunday morning asking when I was coming to pick her up. We started having the occasional overnight and all was going awesome. 

1 year ago is when all the shit started. I gave my daughter the choice of spending the night. She chose to stay with me. The aunt who has guardianship was hurt by this. I saw my daughter once after that. The next time I saw my daughter there was controversy over which movie I took her to see. By choosing a different movie than what I was told to take her to see by the aunt I was ""going against her families morals and values"". 

After that ALL my access was cut off. When I tried to call I was told ""if you keep calling I'll get a restraining order against you"". Even though that was the 4th time I tried to call in 3 weeks. My entire family and I were blocked on all online communications from my daughter. I couldn't even send a ""Happy Birthday"" on facebook. 

I of course got a lawyer and started into the court system. It took until October for me to even have an afternoon with my daughter again. I requested the office of the children's lawyer to get involved because of the blatant alienation. My daughter went from leaving my ex gf's husband at the door (when returning from a weekend there) to rush to the phone to call me ASAP

The children's lawyer found that it's my fault! I'm pushing too hard despite always waiting on my daughter's calls and not initiating visits. My ex who gave up all her rights signing over guardianship has more access than I do. I've done everything I possibly can right. They're trying so hard to demonize me that they're reaching into ""third hand smoke"".

What I'm left with is being relegated to being nothing more than an extended family member. I get 1 Saturday afternoon per month. I have to restart the entire bonding process again and get to miss even more of my child's life. 

What it all boils down to is that I'm at the point of being ready to give up completely. Accept my role as nothing more than an extended family member seeing my daughter occasionally. I have no idea how someone is to form a parental bond with only 8 hours a month of time or how they expect that to happen. The problem is I just can't let go. This is my daughter after all. I can fully understand why there's so many dead beat dads now thanks to this system. 

I'm being torn to shreds inside. I'm hitting low dark places that I'm not even comfortable with. The idea of where to hide the bodies does cross my mind quite frequently now as there's just pure rage being buried and that's not who I am.

Background info:
So my girlfriend (22) and I (23) have been dating for three years and have agreed to have sex for the first time. For those of you not laughing your butts off right now (it's cool

So we do all the usual couple stuff: go on a date, etc. On the way back to my apartment we pick up some condoms at the local drugstore. Not knowing what kind to get we pulled the most interesting looking one off the shelf and headed back asap.

Cut to intimate time and I slip one on. Within seconds I was no longer hard and no matter what we did afterwards I couldn't get it up. We figured it must have been first time jitters so we resolved to try again in the morning. Within seconds of our next attempt I was soft once again. After a third attempt we bought a different pack of condoms and got the same result. 

My questions:
Am I doing something wrong here? I figured wearing a condom shouldn't be too difficult but apparently i'm not very good at it. Any advice on my situation?

Being criticized for something you have no control over is less threatening to your ego than criticism for who you actually are or how you choose to behave. 

Even if you define attractive as more than just physical attractiveness (confidence, compassion, material wealth), I still don't think this improves the advice. It allows uncritical acceptance of the idea that attractiveness is like a natural talent - some people Have It, and others Don't. I feel the reality is more like most other endeavours - some lucky people might just Have It, but most people have to self reflect and work to overcome their weaknesses, whatever they might be.

Some things about me : I am 25, video games. But my focus in my studies lies in biodiversity, conservation, development, the like. Moved here, into another country, 3 years ago today. It was a LONG road, but somehow I managed to get this far.

I didn't think much of relationships for the last three years. I never actively searched for a girlfriend, studying, the like. I wasn't self centered or anything, I enjoyed the company of women but did not find anyone who made me feel like I want to pursue anything further than a physical relationship.

Almos three months ago (sorry for maybe sounding chaotic but I am not well) I met the most beautiful

Two weeks ago, agreed on some stuff, disagreed on others, but we discussed it very nicely and we managed to end the conversation in a very positive and healthy way.

That morning, meditating, taking long walks, what have you. I didn't want to see anyone, not even her. I put off school work and took time off of work. Went to a psychologist who after that referred me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Sertralin and Xanax. Took the for four days, stopped it as they were turning me into a zombie. 

Through all of this, if I truly love her or not, I question everything about our relationship basically. And I have no god damn idea why. I love her so much, I want our relationship to work, I do not want to break up with her for this, it is not healthy nor wise. Breaking up with her would only make me feel worse, as I am positive that such a fit would be hard to be found again and basically

So, just to know that everything will be alright and that I will leave this crysis behind me someday. I would be more than happy to provide additional info, about anything, may it be PM or anything. Please, help me out, friends!

""Why are straight men often ridiculed and made fun of by gay men and straight women alike? I understand the whole ""male privilege"" thing, horny, sexist pig"" stereotype that is so quickly assigned them.
 
Straight men and I didn't start off on the right foot, and laughed at when I spoke my mind in class. So it's no surprise that when I made the switch to public school I quickly discovered that not all men are jerks: a lesson I think society needs to realize. Yes, I was still made fun of and bullied by guys at school, but I also began making guy friends. The fact that a straight guy was willing to be seen in public with a known homosexual was mind-boggling at first, but soon began to feel normal.
 
Maybe it's because my closest girl friends had best guy friends that I began to know through my circle of people
 
So that begs the question: why do guys get such a bad rep? Of course there are statistics of rape, the LGBT population included. I've volunteered for marriage equality with straight guys. I've been to the club with a group of friends and my boys are always willing to be my wingmen. So the next time you make an assumption that a guy is automatically a douche because of his genitalia, think instead of your brothers, and friends, and loved ones that have been by your side and stood up for you when you needed them most.
 
So I say thank you to straight men. Thank you for proving me wrong. Thank you for the support you've shown me and my friends. And thank you for giving me and best friends material to talk about for hours on end.""

The United Nations states that solitary confinement for over 15 days is torture, the longest for 42 years.

Solitary confinement is literally torture, but as gang prevention. If prisoners so much as speak to anybody known to be in a gang, they're labeled as gang members themselves by guards and thrown in solitary confinement so that they don't 'conspire' with other prisoners. (And let's be honest - if you grow up in the ghetto, your going to know a few gang members. If a person gets thrown in jail for a non-violent crime and sees another person he grew up with (a gang member), then he's going to say hello to that person. Guards see that and they now considere that person a gang member too and throw him in solitary confinement.)

Prisoners are being subjected to this torture for decades right here in California. The responsibility to stop this lays with all of us as a self-governing nation and state. Just 10 hours from where most Californians sit

* it discourages people from being part of a community.

* hate-speech creates unhealthy self-perception.

* it's inherently wrong.

* it reinforces a cultural narrative that makes it acceptable to discriminate against someone.

* it represents a much larger

Now discriminating speech towards a historically privileged group still fits the bill for all but the last two. With that in mind

Cultural narratives have to start somewhere, doesn't make meaningful changes in society. It only creates more bickering and hatred.

I also want to make clear that this is not meant to be used as ammunition to silence criticism and meaningful insight. There is a huge distinction between hatred and criticism. 

**edit**: I should probably give more context as the statement could understandably be misunderstood without proper context.

From what I gather

I talked about this a little in [The Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/dvq0r/the_rules/)

Here's the deal: /r/Mensrights is full of *men*. I'd like OneY to be a place for *all* men to get together and talk about issues that pertain to men. I've already said that hate-speech will result in a permaban - It's right there after the welcome mat on the sidebar. If men from /r/Mensrights can come in here and engage in malice-free discussion

I said it in The Rules,"" I'll ban you! If you start a topic that says ""I have a problem with feminism"" and then attempt to start an intellectual conversation, good on ya. I encourage you to do that if that's how you feel (though keep in mind that if you're going to talk about feminism, you will need to be focusing on how it pertains to men, else why post it here?).

Here's something else I said in The Rules though: ""this Reddit is **not** /r/Mensrights. If I see that it's starting to take a very political slant, as a man, to other men."" 

[This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/dvswm/were_the_frog_mens_rights_is_the_scorpion_get/c13bsow) has the right idea. While I have said, I think it *does* serve an important purpose. I don't subscribe to it. That doesn't mean some of the men in here may not find it useful.

Being in quite a small circle it created a rift between me and my friends, using the word as though it was justifiable to call absolutely anything from a peck on the cheek when she was 12 with one of my best friends to some genuinely questionable rumours about a 21 year old guy who according to some people didn't exist being forced, this girl was insane and everyone saw it, my mates were my mates again, all good.

Now I've got a lot more attractive since then, I'm 6""2 and have modelled for a couple of photographers and often get people commenting on my looks, I have a friend whose place I've been round to a couple of times and his housemates (all female) don't leave me alone for a second, constantly giving me free beer and food. I've also had sex since then, but only when I've been super fucked at festivals and been dragged back to a tent, and, not that I mind being used it's not what I want.

I can't flirt anymore, I want sex, one night stand or not I just want to have a little bit of control over the situation, I want to approach a girl in a bar and be all cool but I just can't because I'm afraid of another situation like that. I've only recently joined the dots that this whole inability to talk to women stems from that one night.

tl;dr I was accused of rape by a sociopath and now

I'm asking OneY because all I get on /r/dating_advice is, ""You'll scare off women if you're looking."" This advice comes almost exclusively from women. The sex that has people approaching them for dating. 

I went through a really shitty break up in March

My problem is two fold. 

I have no idea how to approach women

I'm terrified of approaching women in public. Spend time on /r/askwomen and you'll see how much most women hate being approached in public. I can hold a conversation just fine. I just have no idea how to initiate without being blatantly obvious that the reason why I approached her is because I find her physically attractive and I hope she'll be attracted to someone like me. (Being short really limits your playing field. I have no issue with dating taller women

The other being casual dating. I don't know how to do it. Of the past 5 or so dates I've been on in the past few years (only one of which was after  my break up

Perhaps I'm jaded because a lot of the female friends I have usually have two or three dates lined up each week

About 10 minutes later, things get a little heated so I suggest we go to my room. However, at that moment I realized how drunk she was, told her we need to stop. I get her number and take care of her the rest of the night, despite her making weak advancements at me (we did some mouth bumpin but nothing like before). I ended up taking her home (with a DD driving). 

The caveat, a virgin. Definitely could've gone all the way that night. Did I do the right thing? I feel I did the most gentlemanly thing I could've done, but on a baser level I'm really pissed off at myself for not taking advantage of a situation that doesn't occur to me often.

So my mom was diagnosed with colon cancer a couple years ago, she got a PET scan saying she was cancer-free. But then, during a fairly routine surgery involving taking out her chemo port, her liver started failing, and she spent almost a month in the ICU recovering from that and related complications. 

Around Thanksgiving, and within days she was back in the ICU. 

And then 10 days ago

She was 56

Given the circumstances, we thought she was going to die, but instead she started being able to talk, and to my amazement she was her old self, totally lucid and cracking jokes, just in a really slow, feeble voice. One of the many funny things she said:

&gt;Mom: Do you remember the brown ..are in Patten?

&gt;Sis 1: What? The brown mare?

&gt;Mom: No

&gt;Sis 1: A mare? A female horse?

&gt;Mom: NO.

&gt;Mom: The brown bear in Patten

(There's this caged bear near the Lumberman's Museum in Patten

&gt;Us: Oh

&gt;Mom: PETA would have a field day with that.

&gt;Sis 1: Mom

&gt;Mom: Well

After a couple days of talking to her, with me and my little sister nearby.

I still can't totally believe it.

I guess one of the major things I'm feeling is sadness/powerlessness that she died before I was able to help her have a better life. Her life was awesome until dad left, really hard to do as an older woman who's been a housewife all her adult life. I wanted to be able to buy her a house, help her start a catering business, etc. one day. But instead, she died at 56, at a time when I've been too broke to even send her flowers in the hospital (not that they allow them in the ICU anyway) :( Not to mention the fact that the two of my sisters with stable jobs were fronting the money for all these expenses.

(I'm not trying to be FML here – I actually just got my check for an awesome temp job I did recently, and still somewhat even now)

Beyond that, is making me really pensive about my direction(s) and priorities in life, and it's perhaps especially overwhelming due to not having a normal job to give my days an anchoring sense of routine. Yesterday I got back to Boston and had a huge house party for NYE, which was really nice, but now I'm just drinking the leftover beer and browsing reddit not knowing what to do with myself.

EDIT: how foolish of me to not mention the risks and symptoms. I'm not doing my job properly. 

PROSTATE CANCER 

•Symptoms include Trouble urinating, Blood in the semen, Swelling in the legs, Discomfort in the pelvic area, Bone pain. 

•Every man is at risk of developing prostate cancer. Based on the rates from 07-09, blacks are more at risk in developing prostate cancer. 

More men die from prostate cancer than so women from breast cancer. 

•An Australian study has shown that men who masturbate 5 or more times a week are 34% less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Sex works the same, which is a type of herpes that has been found in cancerous prostate tissue. 

Another study has shown that red wine also reduces your risk

A little known study has shown that walnuts not only reduced the risk in developing prostate cancer but also assisted in treatment. 

TESTICULAR CANCER 

•Symptoms include A swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, A dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back.

•Some men may not know they have it until it spreads and those signs include Dull pain in the lower back and abdomen, fever, or a general feeling of illness (malaise), Shortness of breath, coughing, or chest pain, Headache, or dementia.

•it's wise to check yourself for lumps in the shower almost the same way a women would her breasts. 

•Testicular cancer is very rare

•Some studies have shown that men who smoked marijuana regularly when younger are more at risk. 

•the cure rate is one of the highest at 90%

Basically his argument is that a ""real man never hits a woman."" I said ""what if the female starts the fight"" he says ""doesn't matter

I say ""what if a male starts a fight with you"" he says ""beat his ass.""

I say ""what if you see a tall muscular female black belt beating the shit out of a frail old man""

I say ""Ok what if you see a short scrawny young male beating the shit out of a frail old person?"" he says ""BEAT HIS ASS""

At one point he said (and I am not making this up) ""I wouldn't hit a woman for the same reason I wouldn't hit a baby."" I said ""so you're saying women are defenseless (and offenseless) as infants?"" He says ""No that's not what I'm saying."" But when I asked him to explain how that wasn't the only logical conclusion he wasn't able to give me a response that made sense to me.

My own view is that violence should be used only when absolutely necessary and only when non-violent options have been exhausted.   And even then

I told him his beliefs are offensive and harmful and that most people wouldn't agree with him. He thinks most people think like him except scumbags and misguided and/or man-hating feminists. He went off on a tangent about how feminists destroyed gender roles and how much harm that has done to society. I tried pointing out that the gender roles that have been diminished since the 60s were not universal roles and that many societies have been much more egalitarian than 1950s American society. He didn't buy this because of the fact that men do most of the hunting and warring in every society.

I asked him if his fiancee agreed with him about all this and he said she did (""and that's why I'm marrying her"") and then I had to stop him from asking a random girl walking down the street (we were outside) whether she agreed with him. Since he thinks most people think like him and I disagree

I'm going to be sending the link to this discussion to him and encourage him to sign up for a reddit account (I don't think he has one) to respond to people here if he wants and to clarify any misconceptions I may have made in my argument. He may not have much time to respond for a few days but I wanted to at least hear what people had to say tonight. I have done my best to paraphrase our conversation from memory.

I wanted to post it in r/relationships so there would be responses from both genders, I still would like to get all genders' responses. So hopefully you'll accept the cross post being posted here.

(Aside, but the idea still makes me very uncomfortable.)

------------

Dan Savage released a new book this month (American Savage) and in the second chapter he argues that sometimes it's okay to cheat. Those times are when your long-term committed partner no longer has a libido and is no longer interested in sex. He argues that our society teaches married couples that when this happens, Savage suggests cheating.

He lays out some rules for this type of cheating: don't do it in your married home/bed, don't text or email the person, don't know the person socially, be honest with the person, don't continue contact with the person once you two stop having sex together, and absolutely without exception use condoms each and every time you have sex with this person.

He gave an example of a man married 20+ years and deeply in love with his wife but her libido suddenly died. They tried everything; exercise, trips, him doing more housework, taking care of the kids, etc - nothing worked, her libido had just simply died. So he had this secret affair using the rules above for four years, while maintaining a wonderful loving but sex-less marriage with his wife, while maintaining his marriage

Savage lists times when it isn't okay to cheat though: when your partner does have sex with you it's not okay to cheat

So what do you all think?

I'm a senior in high school

Skipping forward to the last night of the trip. We're in the hostel in Paris, the teachers are in a room down the hall. Almost all the students are in their rooms drinking heavily and celebrating the good times had on the trip (I really don't know how we got away with this, I think the teachers knew but figured we weren't getting into any real trouble, I digress, I'm a pretty bad storyteller.) 

Anyways, Tom, Phil, and Brohammad_Ali (the names have been changed on the off chance someone I know reads this, they'll figure out who's who anyway, but changing the names makes me feel better.) Anways, Jack doesn't drink so he's sleeping, Phil and I are drinking pretty heavily for high school boys and are sharing several bottles of cheap vodka and rum. One girl (Sarah, we decided to try to stay up all night so we'd be able to sleep on the plane

Phil gets another text from Sarah, when the girls told me to go back to my room and wake up Tom. Apparently Sarah wanted to make out with him. At this point I realized that I'd left my room key back in my room. I went back out in the hall and pounded on my room's door for several minutes to no avail. Tom wasn't waking up and I wasn't getting back into my room tonight. 

I went back to Sarah's room and informed the girls of the situation. They told me I could sleep in their room

Almost as soon as the lights were out we began kissing and generally feeling each other up (I should mention at this point that this was the farthest I've ever gone with a girl

I finally got a few hours of sleep and woke up the next day in her bed. I sneaked back into my room (Jack had already woken up so he let me in) changed clothes and went downstairs for breakfast. It was at that point that I realized that the previous night when the lights had gone out in the girls' room, Sarah's original planned paramour) and generally I felt pretty awesome about myself.

After breakfast I managed to get some time alone with Sarah and she made it clear to me that the previous night had just been a one time thing. 

That's where my trouble starts. I've become infatuated with Sarah. I barely know her, and meanwhile I know she really regrets the whole thing ever happening.

It's been about two weeks since I got back from France and this has been eating at me the whole time. I haven't told any of my friends my version of the story because I know none of them have been in this situation and I feel that would just make things worse. I apologize for any (many) grammatical errors, run on sentences and the rambling nature of this tale. 

I've wanted to get this off of my chest and I discovered this subreddit pretty recently so I figured I'd vent here and maybe get some good advice from you guys. None of my friends are redditors so I feel pretty safe posting all this here.

Her reasoning for this thinking is that I'm ""suddenly working a lot of extra hours and days"".  Which is completely true.

When I was 11 I was sexually assaulted by my sister's friend at a sleepover.

Between the ages of 13- 17 I was molested by a neighbor many times. At the time I didn't think it was as bad as it was. She was mostly sweet to me but I felt threatened and intimidated by her so I never told anyone. 

If I was a few years older there would be nothing wrong. She was sweet

I was kept sheltered so other than my sisters I never really got to know any girls and when I went away to college I didn't know how to interact with them. I would get physically hot, I'd feel terrible about it and my ego was shot.

I didn't know it then

One woman, naive as I was (am still, really) I thought I was in love with her. 
She was abusive and manipulative. I didn't notice it until it was over because that's all I've ever known when I was close to a woman but it wasn't healthy and fed into my fear and anxiety. She was physically

I still have a long way to go but I'm trying. I'm constantly frustrated by how this hampers my life. I even have trouble working closely with women and I get a panic attack when one brushes me in public. It really worries me and I have fears for my future because of it. I want to meet someone and I want to fall in love but I really don't see that happening in a healthy way. I still have nightmares about women and sexually I'm a mess. I've only had a couple times I have been sexual as an adult that were were completely healthy. I'm ashamed of this and would never admit it. I don't know what to do.

In 2008/2009 the province dedicated $561,236 toward women's resources. The inflated numbers for women's funding for this year are due to more gender-specific funding toward ending domestic violence. Both 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 had funding toward ending domestic violence that was close to on par with the previous year, but the news releases were quite vague and it was impossible to determine to whom that funding actually went. The numbers for the latter two fiscal years are lower for women's resources because of this. Also, in the latter two fiscal years the province started a Provincial Homelessness Initiative. Under this, more funding has gone toward shelters that house both men and women and more funding has been handed out in the form of low-interest mortgages rather than grants.

It's interesting to note that the funding has increased quite substantially year by year for men, and men (in my province, at least) seem to be getting the short end of the stick.

Most of the funding for women went to shelters, the majority of the funding was dedicated toward addiction and recovery centres.
I know as a receptionist at the resource centre I see a great deal of helplessness and desperation. Sometimes there is anger and resentment. I volunteer for the men's resource centre because I was in a horribly abusive relationship for years. My ex husband was raised in a family where this sort of behaviour was typical - commended, and that's not fair.

I'm not sure what the solution is. Certainly men need more resources available to them.

5.	I have **ADD** (and I take **Ritalin** for it)
6.	I have ridiculously **low self esteem**

Then I uprooted my life a year later, and moved out to his city. Now I asked him to stop looking at porn. He now lives in my house with me, he has no job, he does not go to school. I am around 24/7 to keep him satisfied, we are happy. Do you think its reasonable to ask of him this one thing? Probably not.

I would highly recommend that other interested people check out the male section on [BabeLand.com](http://www.babeland.com/mens-toys), which was very highly reviewed.

to explain my personal situation: I'm 17 years old and kind of a late bloomer

About a year ago I noticed that masturbation for me was more of a habit than something I enjoyed

Over the following two months I noticed a lot of changes in my mindset

After two months I started questioning if the changes I had gone through were some kind of natural progression/maturing or if all of this was caused by stopped masturbation and just a way of my body trying to get me to ""get some"". Well, no desire for women whatsoever, I didn't give much of a shit about people anymore, I found the thought of craving intimacy ridiculous. I also was less motivated to do something at all (during the two prior months, I was pretty energetic).

This discovery kind of shocked me since my character seems to depend largely on how strong my cravings for sex are at the moment. I prefer the more emotional, to the extent that I have troubles falling asleep at night because I'm constantly aroused. My sleep has become worse, I often wake up during the night and can't get back to sleep because of said arousal. Luckily, physical activity works wonders in that department. 

In the last time
* What if my compassionate and kind character lasts only to the next ejaculation
* Am I unable to love someone when my sexdrive is low at the moment? (For the record, I can't relate to that).)
* Is sex really the only thing that drives my behaviour?

I'm a single

I've been single for a little bit more than a year, I'm not sad or depressed, but I'm not as pumped up and superpositive I was a few months ago.  

I don't feel lonely or feel like a need to chase girls, but that feeling quickly fades.

I also have a really hard time motivating myself, watching an entire movie in one sitting. I really want to be able to do whatever I set my mind to, but it seems that I'm not able to push beyond my inherit laziness.

My last issue is that I have no genuine intrests or hobbies, but my friends either don't want to give new stuff a shot, or they do things without me because they think I wouldn't be interrested. Yes, sometimes I've tried something and decided that that wasn't for me and I can understand that they assume I wouldn't be interrested. But I don't know what I can do to find something interresting to do without them. I live in a small town (especially by american standards) with about 30 000 inhabitants.

She always has her phone locked.  I never gave it much thought.  I just figured she locked it so people didn't mess with it at work, but I started to get suspicious after a while.  I pay attention to her password, and she forgets her phone at home one day.  I do some snooping and I find out that she's cheating on me with not one, not two, but THREE of my fucking ""friends.""  And if that's not bad enough, she's been hooking up with one of her ex's, too.  And of course, based on the combination of text messages/dick pics on her phone at that moment in time.

He has been in the course of his lifetime a professional driver, and his bilingualism has been an asset to him in a variety of jobs over his life time. He never taught me to drive (I'm 27, still don't do it), never taught me to play, never taught me to speak french, and never encouraged me to join sports. He didn't really interact with me in any sort of a mentoring capacity, except to curb any behaviour that he found to be annoying (through means of over the top intimidation). And there wasn't really any other adult males in my life, meek sort of weirdo

And now I'm working with special needs kids, there are practically no males in the field and they are dying for male interaction. But the more I'm at this job the more I'm not sure I'm cut out for it, and the more I'm realizing how just how fucked up my early life experiences left me.

In store happened to also have a single barber station and sold ""spa like"" straight razor shaving services.  I decided to indulge some and 1 hour later (yes it really was nearly an hour) I had a nice shave

So I was walking around the store asking about this and that just trying to get more info about old fashion shaving.  Here's some of the stuff that I was told.  Sorry to any shaving enthusiasts

* 1) The brush that you use to apply cream is badger fur.  They are used because badger fur is inherently anti-bacterial.  There is also variable densities and types of fur from parts of the badger.  Some brushes will be softer and or denser because of this.

* 2) The brushes they sold at the store were between 2 to 3 times more expensive than what I found online.

* 3) There is a 4 step method to shaving; oiling up, then after-shave/moisturizer.

* 4) Alcohol is bad for your skin because it dries it out.  I had always thought that if it didn't sting it wasn't working.

* 5) if you moisturize your face you should also moisturize your neck too.  The reason is if you take care of your face and not your neck the discrepancies might be too attention grabbing as you get older.

* 6) You only need a very small amount of the shaving cream they were selling on the brush to get a very rich lather.

* 7) The ""blade wars"" as I called it are a tad bit unnecessary.  1 sharp blade would be more than accurate.

* 8) There are blades so sharp that they would remove more skin than necessary when shaving.

* 9) Every person's face/skin/hair is different and would have different needs.  Beyond the normal/sensitive

Anyways

Sometimes I'll see myself in the future or in sexual fantasies as a woman

Another part of me wonders if I'm self-loathing because of how crappy a lot of guys are. I do feel like women are better people on the average, loving relationship with a woman, these feelings might just go away.

Right now, I'd probably just stay female most to all of the time. There would be advantages and disadvantages to both genders and I realize that no such technology exists.

Buy a freakin safety razor. 

Not that Gillete 5 blade + beard comb and moisture strip shit. I mean what your grandpa used. Single blade. It its the absolute closest shave you will get short of using a straight razor. And while you're at it

Pros- 

* Closest shave you can comfortably get without having to relearn how to shave (straight razor).

* You're classy as fuck with these things.

* Cheaper in the long run. A normal safety razor such as a Merkur can run 50$ but the blades are at most 5. After four refills you've already paid for the expensive cartridges that Gillete Mach 5's and all that stuff use. Need to shave on vacation but cant get a blade in your carry on? Pop the blade out of your razor and buy one at your destination.

Cons-

* There really aren't any. You may cut yourself the first or second time but keep in mind you're running the absolute sharpest thing you've ever held across your face.

1353800413.0,13qh5t,Three years with my SO now. Sex life is boring as hell.,dalsgaard,72,24,67,"I considered creating a throwaway

Anyway; my ex-girlfriend and I had a pretty awesome sex-life. We'd do it everywhere, tying up, handcuffs, leather, threeways with chickens (Ok, maybe not that kinky), etc. Anyway, but out of bed it just didn't work; so we broke up.

My now SO is another story though. In the beginning we had lots of sex, she's, uhhmm..... unimaginative enough, that all she wants is doggystyle from time to time. She's not a prude or anything; in fact I don't think it's even possible to offend her. She's just not that much into sex I guess. Sometimes it gets a bit frustrating, because I don't want to be the kind of guy who initiates everytime (And when I do, it's almost impossible to get her into it). Anyway, she does have this one fantasy that she wants to try, and I'm still nervous about it. But that's about the only fantasy she has.

Anyway, but it's no great success. Anyway, our relationship is awesome except for this issue. We're really good friends, and we have a really great chemistry and connection, but we both agree that we're really missing something in the sex department.

Any ideas

1369510137.0,1f1kge,Recent erection issues,1ythrowaway,60,11,27,"I'm 24. About two months ago I suddenly had a massive drop off both in sensation in my penis and in my ability to maintain an erection. I've had a gf this whole time and have had many other gfs throughout my life and this isn't normal. I went to the doctor about a month after it started for unrelated issues with sinus headaches and mentioned it to him. He said to abstain from sex for a month as I had desensitized myself to sex. I find this highly unlikely as the drop off was so sudden. Regardless I resisted masturbating or having sex for about two weeks. While it did help me get erections quicker I still had no increase in sensation and would still lose my erection while having sex. I wanted to have sex it was just that I had no feedback to keep it erect. I've been having sex since then but it is much less frequent. I can't even cum everytime although I can still make my gf cum although by the time it is over I'm just frustrated because I'm super sweaty with no reward other than her satisfaction which only goes so far. Basically I'm wondering has anyone else ever had a similar issue and if so is my doctor right or could this be something else? Also
**TL;DR:**  
 * Haven't had almost any sensation in my penis in two months  
 * Want to know what a sudden drop off in sensitivity in my penis could be caused by  
 * If you've experienced this how long did it last

Like...so take mating for example.

So go do what you love

So what is that? That thing you'd ultimately feel fulfilled doing? Making widgets? Selling widgets? Cleaning widgets? Marketing widgets? Making fancy illustrations of concept widgets, and you hire a model to stand next to the widget, and someone develops an app that takes a picture of your friend and replaces his head with a widget with his face on it, and programmers took time out of their day to make the app, and lawyers were paid to make sure no one steals the name of your widget, and ice trucks have to have special coolant gas canisters designed for them to keep the widgets cool while you ship them.

Efforts towards a small shallow thing or just doing it because I thought it was what I was supposed to do, but when I do these things for a while, suddenly I stop, and ask myself, like, it's that if I ever come up with anything there's already dozens of other similar people all over the planet coming to similar conclusions.

We're actually spending less on space? Budget reduction of space exploration? Cutting programs? It's 2013...WHY?

I've seen arguments that space exploration is ""a waste of money""...think about that for a second...in the grand scheme of things, don't you just DO it? Like I was listening to some story on NPR, and some politician talks about holding a special election. The question was actually brought up, ""How much money is this election going to cost the taxpayers?"" And I'm like....""HELLO, don't we need an elected official to hold this empty position? So if it's what we need to do then why does it matter how much it costs?"" I think space exploration is the same way. It's what we're supposed to be doing. It's where manpower and brainpower are ultimately supposed to be focused. So can we focus on it? I just think it would be sweet to see space exploration explode by leaps and bounds during my lifetime. During my parents' lifetime, even.

1366606678.0,1cuhfo,I don't know where else to go with my thoughts.,lackinginhelp,57,16,12,"Not going to lie

I don't even mind if I never get a response

Let me preface this by stating that I grew up in a family of females.  My father/uncles were generally uninvolved, they're strong and capable, but I feel that I'm not.  I'm 27 years old.  Apart from my brother and a couple MUCH younger cousins, every blood relative was a female in the past two generations, excluding my father :p

When I left school early I started working construction for my dad, and when I got home I would sleep until the next work day.  Most of the time I could hardly work the second day, with inner thighs chaffing so bad I couldn't walk.  I feel like I worked my ass off.  I started working at the beginning of summer in Phoenix, AZ.

I felt terrible about my lack of contribution, and that they understood as much. 

My (now) brother in law worked for my father at the same time I did.  He was a meth addict that slept in his truck for 4-5 hours a day.  He made more money than anyone else at the time, and father, and I love him dearly.  He has overcome his addiction, and is a brilliant father to his children.

After my father lost his crew I tried to pick up where I could, and have been bringing on my friends to fill in for labor and help his company continue.

Oh wow

I brought in a good friend to work

I've run my father's company ever since.  He chastises me when I ask for more effort from his employees

I've been praised for my work by ex-employees and the man who provides the contracts for most of our work.  I'm not just claiming I'm capable for the sake of puffing myself up

My mother has told me that she won't defend me against my other family members because I don't need defending.  Every single fucking time I bring up my issues with my family members they tell me about theirs and tell me how lucky I am.  I'm 27 years old, and I hate the premise that all of my friends will be building lives in the next few years and I have nothing.

I get up at 4:30 in the morning, do most of the skilled labor needing to be done, bring them their pay, and at the end of the week I'm told how good they are at what they do.

When I try to bring up my problems with my family to get some help for myself they tell me about theirs and expect me to understand that I don't have it that bad.

The thing is I respect and love the people I have around me in my life.  I don't mean to claim that I don't.  They seem to care about me.  I just wish I felt the same way about myself.

I can't afford help anywhere else.  I've been making efforts at meditation and dieting

tl;dr pitty me.

So here's a question... I finished college last May.  I finally got a job this August and moved across the country.  During the summer, hanging out on the beach and reading during the day.  I also worked out a good deal.  

So now my biggest fear is that I've moved, but I'm pretty much on fresh feet and I don't know what to do.  I did move with my girlfriend, who is now looking for work.  But for my own development, I don't know what to do.  I don't have friends here.  I don't know the city (Los Angeles) at all.  Basically the only thing I know how to do is fill my apartment with shit... which I don't really want to do.

The first one was that my parents divorced and my narcissistic

The second was when I lost faith in my hero

I grew up a Mormon.  I was toe-the-line zealous, whatever adjective you want to use--it would fit.  I ***believed*** and I used what I was given (the Mormon scriptures) to form my worldview.  I voraciously devoured them all.  I was also taught that Joseph Smith (JS) was a prophet, a man to whom God spoke on earth.  So I realized that I could read his words, *the same words which Jesus himself spoke,* and be confident in their surety and veracity.  His prophecies, statements, and pronouncements which comprise Mormon canon (mainly the Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price (all different books) and to a lesser extent the JS Translation of the Bible) filled my heart and mind with concrete *absolutes

A la divorce.

Gradually my father's inability to empathize, that I tried to fill.  When we moved I tried to fill that father-wound with surrogates, which helped, temporarily.  Nothing was enough, however.

I continued to grow in my faith.  &lt;Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip&gt;  One day, it really suffers from), I ran across the website [MormonThink](http://www.mormonthink.com/), whose mission statement is to investigate the truth and accuracy claims made re. the Mormon church as shown in both the media and from the organization itself.  That was the beginning of the end of my confidence in Mormonism.

I quickly learned that Joseph Smith had been a con-man, by which he could then see.

Then I learned he translated the Book of Mormon *in the same manner.*  Old habits die hard

* The Mormon temple ceremonies that are held in such esteem were stolen from Freemasonry.

* The health code published by Smith, and the claims the church makes today (re. coffee, particularly) are unfounded (by science).  This itself is a product of the culture and time.

* Many of Smith's ""prophecies"" never came true.

* ""Jesus's"" instruction to send men to Salem

* Smith sent men on missions *and married their wives.*

* Smith's horniness extended even to 14-year old Fannie Alger, several of which (33%?) were already married.

Is this the hero I had learned about from the hands of the church that I loved?  Never.  No.  Nope.  So I lost Smith

This is my problem: learning how to trust again.  I feel I cannot now, I *want* to be able to trust in God and Jesus Christ.  But after such monumental betrayal, I don't know how to start.  Please help.

I am only 22

I am an atheist living in Utah, so both in High School and in College, I met very few women.  And those I did meet were generally already married or too religious for my taste.  I work with a start up company, so dating anyone there would be a huge mistake; not that there is anyone I would want to date there.

So I tried a few dating websites.  I had little success besides with one, but being as pathetic as I am, I ignored them, which made the breakup very hard for me to actually do.

I tried going to a couple of get togethers at an anime convention

I am not the partying type, women.  I just feel I never have, nor ever really will, have an opportunity to meet other people. Even when I try and leave my comfort zone, things end rather anti-climatically.  I am trying dating sites one more time, but I don't know if this is a last ditch effort, or if I should just wait and hope that I have an unexpected opportunity. 

What makes matters worse, anime, read books, where there are types of women that I think I would really like (yes, I love the sappy romantic comedies). So it is very hard to be content with anyone I do happen to meet because I feel like they just aren't the type I seem to like the most.  

So my major question is this: How do I get over myself?  How can I get rid of my high standards

*Thank you to everyone who helped me out earlier in the week figuring out what to do and how it was gonna happen. Thank you more than I can say.*

So it happened today.

Yesterday we were going to meet and talk about the whole ordeal. She was floundering so I decided to get a hotel room for two nights for us: one, and more private than anywhere available to us at the moment, and two, because I wanted her to have some type of comfort in this. We ended up having sex last night (the night before it). A lot of sex. Then she cried in my arms. She told me she loves me. Fuck. I can't and don't love her back. Not after the shit she's pulled. I cannot.

This morning we woke up and went to it. Protestors outside holding babydolls. Assholes. Nice security guard let us in. More crowded than I expected (the nurses told me everyone said that). The whole ordeal took around five hours. The first hour was sitting in the waiting room and filling out paperwork. The next three were her in the operation and recovery. The final hour was me listening to her cry silently and trying to make her feel better. It didn't work.

Left the clinic, half way through the procedure, she came to and started to scream as best she could for them to stop. That had I not been so young and full of potential she wouldn't have done it. That she did it all for me because I have hopes and dreams. That she shouldn't have told me she was pregnant and just kept it, never to bother me again. That she had a name for it (I didn't listen when she told me). **Fuck** I never told her I loved her though. I love her for going through with this and that is about it.

I feel hollow. She tells me all this and I'm just crying. I've broken her. I've broken a human being. I've utterly destroyed her. She is crazy but fragile

I told her I'll be there for her. As a friend if nothing else. I can't abandon her. Not yet. I won't be her lover but because I've done this I will make sure she is okay. I have to.

She's in the bed right now sleeping. I'm in a chair writing this out. I've got to go hold her. She's crying in her sleep.

“Wait

“It's fine

“It's not fine!” Taylor says. “We're not fucking without a condom.”

The response from Jesse is not verbal. Jesse simply climbs up on top of Taylor and initiates standard penis-in-vagina intercourse.

****

In this scenario

Logically and ethically, or lack thereof, is the same. But in practical terms? Only a male Jesse would be a rapist under this hypothetical scenario. To most people, and arguably society as a whole: a man can rape a woman with his penis, but a woman cannot rape a man with her vagina.

Many people believe it is literally impossible for men to be raped by women in the same manner as the above scenario. They will say that such a thing is physically impossible, are psychologically incapable of violence. Never mind that some men are physically weaker than some women.

But it's more than that. A male victim of rape who went to the police with such a story would be laughed out of the station. 

There was a recent case in Germany of a man who, the words rape and rapist was never used. Instead, the woman was described as “sex-mad”. [Incredibly, the woman was never named, but in some articles the victim was](http://www.theprovince.com/news/German+Dieter+charge+woman+confined/6470665/story.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter
). The facts of the event do not seem to be in question

Imagine an article where a woman was forced to have sex—locked in a room

You may be thinking that cases of women raping men are so rare as to be a relatively trivial issue. According to a recent survey by the Center for Disease Control, an equal 1.1% of women reported being raped by penetration during the same time period](http://imgur.com/a/aw0eU).

But alas, but as victims of “other sexual violence.”

Why is that relevant? Because then

“Nearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and 1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives”

This nice soundbite can be repeated in articles for the masses, to see the data for themselves](http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf).

All of this goes to show that it is easy to prove that very few men are raped. The only thing necessary is to create a definition of rape which intentionally excludes male victims.

Thanks for all the advice and replies previously. Here's where I'm at now. I do Apologize for the length once again in advance. 


so yesterday was the court appearance as I mentioned. The agreement reached is that I get to see my daughter one a month

The good:

 I still get to see my daughter a little bit. Even if it is being relegated to being nothing more than a visitor as an extended family member. Measures are in place so that there will never be another period of 7 months without so much as a ""Hi!"" anymore. 

The counseling between us may allow me to break down some of the alienation barriers that have been put up. But after how this all is turning out my faith here is a little lacking. I do get access to her Councillors to finally be able to provide my perspective to them so they're viewpoints may not be so skewed against me in the future as well. 

I do gain some additional time being able to attend and witness events in my daughter's life. So even though I'll have to work and find out the information myself (calling her school to find out about pta meetings

The bad:

I'm nothing more than extended family and a visitor in my child's life. There still will be conflict when it comes to holidays. I'm also getting less time with my daughter than the mother who signed off (this was about me and not what others are getting; is what I was told). 

The communication aspect is based on my daughter contacting me. They completely neglected that her access to these communication forms is entirely montiored and can be witheld and restricted in her living situation. 

There is also nothing in check to prevent any of the progress made in counseling from being completely undone as soon as my daughter gets home. 

The aftermath:

Fuck it. I'm done, things do not always work out. There is not always justice and the right thing. Things just are. 

I will ALWAYS be there for my daughter in any capacity she wants me in. I will try to move forward and carry that faint glimmer of hope that ""someday"" may come. I'll keep jumping through hoops and doing what I can. But I also accept where I stand and can't invest or push any further.

So, horny girl and some of the very first things he tried with me were very kinky and I loved it. He's into BDSM a lot, anytime he watches porn it's bondage.

As for me, I love anal play, I'm bisexual, I love seeing bi guys getting it on, experienced in group sex, not jealous and love to share my partner in any possible way, love outdoors and semi-public sex, I enjoy pain to a certain (high enough) degree

For my boyfriend, quite private about sex (so multiple partners is difficult), nervous about doing it outdoors or in semi-public areas (though I sort of got him to enjoy a quick blowjob in an alley not so long ago)... you know. A bit more reserved than I am. I would never pressure him into something he's not into, this is not the point here. I don't even care if I don't get to share all these kinks with him, I have no hangups about different sexual preferences at large. The point is that I've always had the feeling that deep down, I'm a bit raunchier and more nympho/obsessed and open minded or fluid or malleable than he is.

The first issue we had about sex was that he was being a bit of a pillow princess. I don't mean that in a disrespectful way, it can be hard to make me cum, so maybe he just got complexed about his perceived inability and got discouraged. However, usually it doesn't take as long as it took him to learn how to get me off. There was something weird there.

Since then, and I find it a bit depressing that he never just wants to rip me away from whatever task I'm doing to just fuck my brains out.

Anyway, he said that **he doesn't enjoy going down on me for the purely physical aspect of it, but because he enjoys the pleasure he can give me this way**. Well, call me nitpicky, but this makes me feel bad. I've gone down on him in the past when he was so passed out drunk that he didn't give a damn. I just love to have a cock in my mouth. Soft, hard, semi-hard, I really enjoy giving him pleasure too - I'll tease him, and I'll come faster if I have a cock to suck on. In certain scenarios he calls me his little cockslut

In contrast, for example, go down on me while I was too passed out to care and just for the selfish fun of the physical act. Well, that sort of makes it impossible for me to enjoy. In order to cum quickly and amazingly, I have to feel like my partner is into it, not just for the reaction he gets out of me. I want to be able to call him my little pussy slut, to say to him things like ""Aren't you happy you have such a nice pussy to suck?"" But I can't, he enjoys it, and I just feel awful about having sex with him altogether.

I know a lot of you are going to think I'm asking for a lot. But I've known guys who were just pussy obsessed. They just love it, they love feeling that wetness and just the thought of pussy is enough to get them off. I want to be that for my lover. I find that when a guy is enthusiastic about pussy just for the sake of pussy, they are better lovers in general.

Now, who just wants to tongue me deeper and deeper. If I don't feel that selfish enthusiasm on the guy's part, I feel like I'm imposing, and I have to retreat inside of my head and imagine fictional scenarios and fantasies to get off, which is what I end up doing with him a lot (he doesn't know this). Additionally, it's very hard to talk to him about these things because after talking about it, he just feels self-conscious about everything and can't act naturally and fuck naturally without obsessing over everything we talked about and how nothing that I told him about could possibly be natural now because he's thinking about it all the time.

Any advice at all would be great... I feel so lost right now

Addendum: After a few questions my boyfriend asked me, he would do things differently for sure. Instead of going for technique and trying to figure out what gets me off, he would just bury his face in there, rub his nose in my folds, give my pussy big wet laps because he'd want to taste it so bad, he would tongue me deeply, wanting to taste me... I mean, and this is what gets me off, suck on the balls

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend says he enjoys performing oral sex primarily for the pleasure he gives me while doing so. Personally, and even a blowjob is a selfishly pleasurable experience for me. I wish it was the same for him. What do? :(",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,False,,

By any I mean relationships / sex or whatever.  And yeh, I'm pretty frustrated about it, this fake account nam comes from the idea of Average Frustrated Chump in seduction lingo.

And I don't know what to do about it.  I've been trying OKCupid for the last couple of months, but maintaining a conversation seems nigh on impossible.  I've tried a few approaches, and try to be flirty, slight cheeky, inquisitive etc.  But honestly I feel like I cannot stand out.  Of course the girls on the sight are inundated with messages, and have so much choice!  I'm aware a good portion of the messages they recieve are going to be bad, but even with the conservative estimate of one good message a day, and one of whom was a bad match and lived 5000 miles away in New York (I'm British).  Furthermore, they have sparse


I'm a student and I go to uni, who are often several years older than them (most of my girl  friends do) and thus seem down-to-earth, or seem absolutely spoilt with choice!  I don't want to sound misogynistic, but I know an awful lot of girls who are completely aware that men find them attractive, and can be as capricious, flaky or demanding as they like. Any girl who has the magic combination of down to earth and reasonably physically attractive instantly has the attention of plenty of men.  

I just feel like I have absolutely no sexual currency

I am also a virgin

I just hate that I have to lead in relationships.  I do english Lit at uni and of course this involves a hefty load of feminism, ask them out, lead to sex etc.  The idea of me finding some nice, reasnoably attractive girl who gets on with me and who we share a lot in common seems like some fantastical story.  Insteas guys seem to end up with girls much younger than them so that they can lead the relationship, but this often comes with the cost of not caring about them in any particular way as they so much more experienced in life.  

I wouldn't describe myself as unconfident, pushover-esque talk, and I can be quite cheeky. But I guess sometimes I end up being too ""nice"", often becuase a girl is upset or down about something.  I don't really know how to approach this (and I know this has lead to me being manipulated by emotions), but a lot of sexually successful guys simply don't care.  I know girls are attracted to confindence, but the confindence girls seem to like isn't normal confidence, it seems super cocky, boistrous etc.  I am not really any of those things.

I'm not desperate for sex

A few other points:

-I am not only going for girls who are out of my league

-My lack of girls isn't becuase of some deep seated misogyny, I feel guys who really don't respect girls are able to show off and act confident etc

One of the central problems with being a man circa 2011 is deciding what it means to be a man. If one is pensive and introspective, and avoid common criticisms and cliches. I also seek to avoid the harmful ""man"" concepts as well.  For example, I would like to avoid being patronizing and to assume that women need a man's help to do basic things - for example holding doors open, doing physical labor, buying things.

Integrating all these points of view at the same time is very challenging. It is also difficult to talk about this to some people, the first is I believe I already am a good person, and the second is the implication that the goal of seeking a ""man"" image is an unworthy cause. 

One particularly difficult part of being a man is integrating and combining the multiple aspects of sex and sex drive. Many guys live with a sex drive, shameful, wrong, evil, violent or just sick.  One of the hard parts explaining sex to women is the idea that a man's sex drive is an optional part of him, when for many guys it is such a central force it is difficult to ignore. As per Lewis CK's recent comedy skit ""you are a tourist in sexual perversion, I am a prisoner here.""  One problem being that men's sexuality is not prized

I believe a real man must define his masculinity as he chooses. The body he was born into

What doesn't matter:
- If he's trans
- If he's fucked women, neither, or none.
- If he watches football or curling or both or none.
- If he drinks Bud Light or vodka or ""bitch drinks"" or neither.
- If he wears jeans or dresses. Or of course
What does matter:
- If he chooses to be a man.

I think manhood is made, buying a ""For Woman!"" haircare product. You must define yourself in a society that is intent on defining you. You must choose how you will be a man when all other forces, including other males, have already ""chosen"" how you should be a man. The man, when questioned, when quizzed, can say (without a single bat of their possibly well-defined eyelashes), this ridiculously feminized product is for me. I evaluated this item and it is the best fit for my needs.""

You must sometimes walk a path seemingly barren. Sometimes it may up to you to lead the way. Other men have done it before. Other men have tried and failed. No matter what happens, present, and future—while we may not walk with you, we support you.

---

**Background:** Just when I thought I had my life figured out, but she was shy and throwing mixed signals. After getting rather drunk, I confessed my interest right to her on my way out (at the time I was too drunk to remember, and she was sober). 

When I returned to my friend's house the following morning to help clean up after the party, but resolved just to leave because historically I've talked myself out of forming relationships for a few years now (the reasons I will elaborate on later). However, she stopped me and told me what I said the previous night. I paused for a moment, then revealed that I'd like to take her to coffee that afternoon. She agreed. Turns out we really get along and despite her shy nature, we have a kind of chemistry together, a mutual attraction I haven't felt in a long time, and I have since experienced a lot of mixed feelings. I've since spent the last week communicating with her through voice, and email and all seems well (I don't live near her at the moment

Yet to further preface the questions I have for the OneY community, religion, health, etc). That ended almost 3 years ago, and I've only been on one date since (though I did hook up and lose my virginity to another girl 2 months ago; that's another matter but it's over and done with). In short, I have little experience with the opposite sex, but even greater doubts about relationships/monogamy in general.

**TL;DR** Met a girl with potential

---

So

Ever since my last and only relationship failed, and whether monogamy actually works. I'm concerned about the waste of time, money, and energy failed relationships result in, the regret, the risk, and whether any of it is worth it. Sure, but even my own parents (married 25 years) never seem to live out my idea of a healthy marriage. In fact

Of course, depression, low self-worth for awhile now, all of which have hindered my ability to seek and receive relationships. Sometimes I think I barely know how to love myself, how would I know how to love someone else? I've had difficultly deciding between freedom / loneliness and companionship / conflict, which seem to be the main pros and cons between being single the rest of my life and being married. But make no mistake, any serious relationship only goes one of two ways: either you break up on some terms, and tend to be *very* independent

Moreover, this girl that I met said that she wants kids someday—I've historically felt that I *never* want kids. See, in my mind, that means I should completely cut things off now: why go through the motions with her if we're only going to disagree? If we were to move along with the relationship, I'd likely find myself committing the [sunk cost fallacy](http://www.skepdic.com/sunkcost.html), like I did in the past. The problem is, I can tend to be an idealist, eager to believe that I can find love

Well

* Would you advise me to proceed with my new love interest?

* Is marriage pointless? Is marriage a farce? Is the idea that you can actually spend a lifetime with a soul-mate likely or even practical? 

* Can marriages succeed or fail? If so

* What's the point of any relationship outside of friendship? Commitment? Companionship? Intimacy? 

* What's the most important part of forming an opinion on relationships?

* How do you handle regret / sense of failure from past relationships? 

* Do you love your wife? How do you keep your marriage healthy? What lead you to marriage?

I do not identify as a traditionally masculine man.  Though I am male, throughout my life I have never been comfortable as 'a guy.'  My friends and I, growing up in a tiny town of 3000, struggled to find outlets for expression in an environment that held little opportunity for alternative extracurricular activities.  I played football, ran track, and swam.  But I also ran our tiny schools drama club, and was an enthusiastic artist and am possibly the only person in my entire class who truly enjoyed reading Moby Dick.  I also love cute animals

As I grew older, and the friends I do have I hold very dear.  I was largely unprepared for the real world, and much to the irritation of other men in my life I simply am unable to enjoy watching sports or tuning cars.  My hobbies are just not as widely appreciated, it seems, especially in sports media where I work.

I feel that I, and most women are not attracted to my brand of 'masculinity.'  I'm not an assertive man unless pressed, and I'm not intimidating either.  All I ask is that people accept me for who I am, and respect my opinions on important matters.

Still, I've been a Redditor for four years.  I've seen this community change dramatically.  Though not necessarily always pro-academia, with popularity came anti-intellectual riff raf and individuals who argue that I am a weak person- a beta male to the world's aggressive, ultra-sexual alphas. 

Personally, in post-modern philosophy and even in *feminism*.  These were worlds in which your sex didn't matter, only your worth as a person.  I still appreciate the time I spent studying critical theory in school and occasionally write about it to this day.

That belief, but a person, ruled not through theoretical oppression or conspiratorial forces, but by the choices and mistakes I make.  I do not ask myself 'how can I become a better man?' but instead, 'how can I become a better person?' 

How can you ever be happy if you judge yourself based upon imaginary ideals like 'masculine strength?'  Yet here, struggling against imagined expectations like promiscuity or energy.  Certain attitudes in many subreddits are simply destructive and uninviting to those of us who are not traditionally aligned.  Those attitudes do more damage to men then any exterior force.  If we cannot accept each other as we are, and thus accept ourselves, we will only continue to fall into a confused irrelevancy in the modern world.  We will continue to have anxieties and fall to imaginary pressures, striving to be an imagined ideal that probably never even existed to begin with.

For my part, especially now we're at different universities, but it's too good to just chuck away. So here's what my problem is, and I expect plenty of people will sympathise. It's quite well documented; as men, the general expectation is that we'll go out, get laid, dominate social situations and chase women around until one manages to cast some sort of spell on us and turn us into husbands and fathers. Or something.

So when she gets there early and you skip straight past the first bit, the conversations you overhear in public, the guy having unreasonably loud drunk sex in the dorm room next to you, they'll all add up to instil a sense of having 'missed out' on something. Make you think you should throw away your fantastic relationship for something that, in all probability, you wouldn't be very good at. I mean, I know I'd be shitty at the dating game

You wonder if you should break up - you can always get back together later, another one is bound to, right?

Clearly the thoughts of a crazy person, talks you down and you feel drained and guilty from time to time, and hope that the crazy will pass with time.

So here's what I've learned to do at times like this: I've collected a small set of positive portrayals of relationships, so we can collect them together, share experiences, and above all, bring ourselves back down to earth.

So

* Tim Minchin; he's an Australian comedian and musician. He's 37 now

* Many say it's jumped the shark a bit these days

* I don't *think* they're internationally popular

* Finally, Canterbury

I like to remind myself of things like this on those occasions when things spill over; a little positive reinforcement goes a long way and I hope I can share that with some people here, hope of lots of casual sex. Break up for a real reason.

Me, vocal feminists a little too much, or maybe it's because I think too much, but I've built up this image in my head of a woman experiencing pleasure, and I literally can't enjoy myself unless this mental construct is enjoying *her*self. I only cum when the girl cums when I'm watching porn, and in the very few instances where I've had sex, I've been so incredibly concerned about my partner's feelings that the instant I begin to think about her pleasure being tied to the strength of my erection (during sex)

What worries me is how *deeply ingrained* this attachment to a female body experiencing pleasure is in me. I *need* 'her' to enjoy herself in order to enjoy myself, and the emotions she experiences are the things that *I* should be doing, but can't let myself because either I'm too embarrassed or uncomfortable doing so, or because if I start thinking that *I'm* actually enjoying *my*self, then I instinctively hold back and lose the feeling... probably because I've trained myself to respond to pleasure by killing it - otherwise I might cum too soon or someone will notice that I'm being emotional and insult me for being unmanly or something. &gt;_&lt;

Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? Or is it weird that I'm picturing sex entirely from the female perspective... so much so that I often experience a sense of 'wrongness' in my abdomen, as if my body were trying to kill it...

Though this isn't necessarily an issue related to being male

Lately, but there's nothing there. I have one friend who I really enjoy talking to (a female), two depending on the day (a male). Why do you think I don't feel connected? I'm not dying to talk to them (in fact, the amount of texting I typically do has halved recently) or really see them besides a few of them.. So the relationships just feel meaningless. I don't feel like they can make me feel better if I'm upset, so I don't tell them that much. Now let me give some background on myself..

I'm a senior in high school. I'm gonna major in music performance next fall in college. So

None of my friends love classical

I'm also pretty judgmental.. I can see my friend do one little thing and I think a little less of them. Like lately

However, by not trusting me for a bit, for example. Nearly all of my friends always make fun of me and don't respect me, particularly one girl. It upsets me sometimes when I'm always getting laughed at or undermined by ""friends.""

Umm.. I'm sorry if I'm rambling, or having sex and partying. I feel so far above them it's not even funny. However, some teachers have agreed with me on this, so it's not entirely just me.

And lastly, could care less about cars, etc. I'm straight, but that kind of stuff just doesn't interest me.

So what do you think? Is it that I just don't have good friends? Am I not doing the right things in the relationships? Is it because we are too dissimilar? Am I too judgmental/snobby? 

Ask me any questions that you think would help you answer.

I like looser clothing because it is comfy on my manly parts. With whitey tighties and boxer briefs, no matter what ive worn (up to 10 bucks per pair for sports underwear) my junk slowly gets pushed between my thighs and then my balls get squeezed all day. I cant be re-adjusting every 30 minutes. With boxers i can simply stand up, or keep my legs spread and i get a bit of motion.

So I've tried Hanes and the leg holes are too small and they try to ride up. Since the leg holes are always too small (even though waist fits) they simply shimmy down. Also

Ive tried Croft and Barrow. Those shits were expensive and 100% cotton. They were great for about 2 weeks. now they are shrunken at less than a couple months old. Now no matter what i do those are permanent thongs.

1336512660.0,tdl0s,I was raped by my ex and am too afraid to press charges because of my parents.,unexplainableshame,55,28,51,"I am a 17 year old male, so we were dating at this time. We laid down on her couch after some time and I feel asleep, but I could feel and hear everything happening around me. 

At some point, but I've ALWAYS had issues sleeping so she knew she had crossed a boundary when she did this. I woke up some point later with clear evidence of what had been done, but she denied it for about two hours. She confessed what she had done later that night through text as I kept pressing her. 

At this point, consider if this had happened to a girl. Let's try not to be biased and sexist about this. 

Anyway, so I did pretend. Two days later you could already tell how much it effected me. I took her out to a nice restaurant in fear that she would dump me (because I somehow thought this whole thing was my fault.) I couldn't speak to her the entire time, she pointed out how awkward I was being and I just couldn't come up with any words to say. I tried being my old self from then on but it was phony, and eventually she lost interest and cheated on me in the following couple of months. It's been a little over two months since she's broken up with me today. About a month ago, I started piecing back together what had happened to me. Analyzed how badly her taking advantage of me effected me. I talked to a police officer at my school, and threw this whole scenario at him as a ""hypothetical"". It was so complex he had to make some calls to lawyers to figure out what such a thing would be considered. He told me the minimum punishment someone would get for such a thing would be sexual assault. After 2 months of her ignoring me, she replied to a text I sent her when I brought up that she had raped me.

She's threatening to say I'm harassing her if I try to press charges, in this process, implied that it wasn't the first time she's done such a thing to me. Now, I have proof of her confessing to it when it happened back in January through text records, and a few current texts saved. A good lawyer and I think I have a good case against her. 

The issue now, and fairly intolerant of such progressive things like a guy pressing rape/sexual assault charges against a girl. They're the only thing standing in my way of getting my justice. What should I do?

TL;DR: Ex forced my hand to finger her while I was essentially paralyzed and my parents are intolerant and regressive so I'm afraid to press charges.

I recently spent some time in a hospital without access to razor.  But now that I'm out, which means irritation and ingrowns when I shave/wax my armpits and pubic hair, and slightly translucent, which means you can see the roots of shaved hair under my skin (and a sort of blue marbling of veins... but that's another story).

So it's convenient for me, if the majority of men are disgusted by female body hair, I think it'll be difficult to keep on rolling down the 'feelin' sexy' highway.

Anyway, so that will mean a trip to the doc. If your doc tells you that you need circumcision, don't believe him. Although a frenuloplasty may help. Anyway, get the BMD ointment (ointment works better than cream) and put that on a few times a week. Put on a healthy amount, I usually use about a teaspoon at least. 

I found that the BMD only helped so much though and I needed to stretch that phimotic ring out. I've tried a lot of things. There are commercial products out there to help with this problem (haven't tried those). I don't think you need that. All you really need is something to apply gentle outward pressure on the phimotic ring for a couple of hours per week. After a few weeks it'll be even less than that.

You can do this with your fingers but I found it to be a real hassle and wanted something better. So

[Here's a set of pics that show how.](http://imgur.com/a/88wgg#0) All you really need is some ""friendly plastic""

I think the pics are pretty self explanatory. Once you get the stretcher made (final pic)

-I was no where near the top of her list of priorities, is that I realise I really wasn't high on her list of priorities. Which for some, I'm sure is fine. But it wa sthe lack of balance was the problem. For me, my priorities tend to go Family &gt; Partner &gt; Friends &gt; Work &gt; Anything else. From my perspective, looking back, her priorities seemed to be Work &gt; Cat &gt; Family &gt; Friends &gt; More Work &gt; Me.

-A feeling she felt that money = time/energy spent together. So whilst I am studying, I began to realise I wanted her time and attention far more than her money - a frank answer is that I didn't want another mother.
