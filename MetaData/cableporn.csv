The small dishes are 18GHz or 23GHz 1' size short distance point to point links.  Each one is aimed at a mobile phone tower located within the metro area that is logically/physically downstream of the central location.  

The bigger 2' size dishes are the same radios

The largest dishes are 6 GHz or 11 GHz 256QAM modulated point to point links.

This is a central tower for a mobile phone company in Afghanistan.  This is how you build a star/hub-and-spoke topology network when landlines and terrestrial fiber doesn't exist.

Apologies for submitting non-porn

I recently ordered a couple 1000ft spools of [cat6 500MHz cable](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?p_id=8102) from monoprice.  After spending a couple days doing an extremely pornographic job lacing it all throughout the datacenter, but still isn't up to spec.  People without access to a Fluke DTX wouldn't have the ability to run a [real test](http://imgur.com/a/efOOf) and probably wouldn't be aware of this.

The cable I was shipped was in the original box that the manufacturer in china used to ship it to monoprice.  The box was marked as carton #153



**Update 4/18:**

Monoprice shipped me a new spool of cable

Several people have asked how I'm terminating the cables.  I've used tried a variety of methods, which looks fine to me.  Perhaps the brown pair isn't twisted much, but that's the natural twist of the cable...

Finally, they could be bad, but one would assume if my tester or the adapters weren't working correctly, then other non-monoprice cables would fail as well, which is not the case.",,False,t5_2s9v2,True

1353252268.0,13ef4c,Practicality,coned88,89,22,43,"90% of the cabling jobs shown in this subreddit are not practically good. They may be aesthetically appealing but from a practical point they are horrific  I can't really see the desire for such so maybe it could be explained how aesthetics are more important than practical access on service systems?

Most pictures I see show cabling jobs that are very tight.  They are almost always never labeled on one or both ends.  Though people here gaze in awe like their tightly bound cable bundles are a form of perfection.  The goal for any such job.

It makes me wonder if most people here actually deal with cabling?  Those tightly bound bundles of cables are a nightmare when you need to trace a cable.  The people who do cabling like this usually make it so tight that the hours to days they spent creating their masterpiece has to be undone to trace one unlabeled cable. It doesn't have to be completely undone but it will never be as good looking again.  That then forces the next guy to have to deal with it.  It sucks.  There's nothing worse then having to fight with these tight bundles to find one cable.  You don't want to undo everything but you have to.  It's so tight that there's no way to tug a cable.  

As somebody who actually has to deal with cabling like this from time to time let me suggest that you label everything and the bundles don't have to be so tight.  There's a happy medium where cables are accessible but also to the side and clean.  The cabling jobs don't need to be so extreme.",self,t5_2s9v2,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/comments/13ef4c/practicality/

Unless you can have saturation cabling, most of these examples are a ticket to rats nests.",radix2,85,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/comments/oubq1/dear_cableporn_fans_unless_you_can_have/, this obsession with neatness is a hindrence - not a virtue.  Sure

Backgound: I have over 30 years experience with networks - WANs and LANs. Starting with SNA over type 1A STP and ""progressing"" through various serial and other types before moving onto Token Ring and Ethernet cable plant such as Cat 4, 6 and 6A

Although shit happens less frequently than before (due to the advent of smart switches supplanting dumb hubs)

Discipline is good

1. When repatching - require that both ends be disconnected and then rerouted (not just one end). Bundling interfers with this.
2. Require your staff to document patch outlet number and corresponding switch/port assignment.

Neither are enjoyable for the person who is just trying a quick fix
