We the moderators have decided to blackout the /r/pitbulls subreddit to protest a U.S. congressional move to pass a law known as CISPA.

For those of you that remember SOPA and how the internet collectively rose up against big media's attempt to pass it

Beginning at 0600 GMT (1:00 am Eastern Standard Time) we will shut down the subreddit for 24 hours.  We do this for two reasons: 

1) We believe the issue is important enough to warrant what is effectively a moment of silence; and 

2) We are hoping that some of you might use your free time exercising your rights as Americans fomenting dissent in the following ways (all others can voice their opinion [HERE](https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=9137)).


Step One: Educate yourself;  Unbiased sources are tough to find as literally everyone has an angle they are pursuing.   You can start here: [Learn about CISPA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=CISPA&amp;hl=en&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0IV0UajWE9KC0QHn9IHIAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4QqAI&amp;bav=on.2

Step Two:  [Sign this petition](http://www.avaaz.org/en/stop_cispa/?tta). Make sure to Share on Twitter and Facebook. 

Step Three: [Contact your representative](https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=9048)

Hi /pitbulls. I rescued my buddy Damien,000 in surgery bills in his first year of life) I managed to keep him alive and he has been healthy and happy since. He's the epitome of love, and a posterchild for the breed. When my mom's dog died of old age two years ago, he didn't want to leave when we visited due to her sadness. Long story short, I haven't had the heart to take him back. He saved her heart.

But now he is dying. A few weeks ago, he has had issues with three different neighbors, one involving him shooting someone's house with a BB gun). We think he poisoned my dog :-(

After spending several hundred bucks in treatments and vet bills

If anyone can donate anything, you can upvote for visibility and that is just as appreciated.

[Pictures of Damien](http://imgur.com/a/BedBF)

**EDIT** We did an ultrasound at a non-profit today, he says this would either be from Damien being poisoned or eating tons of bark (which has never happened nor is there bark in the yard for him to eat). Sadly, it is too late for toxicology tests to prove anything or carbon to absorb any toxins. They are out of his system and this is the bi-product.

The vet says he will be dead within a week on the liquid diet and massive diarrhea. We went and got more prescription meds

Thank you to everyone who has spread the message or donated a few bucks. We would not have had the treatment today (which was over $300 total with the prescriptions) if it was not for the kindness to others. It makes the many hateful remarks and PM's worth it!

**EDIT 2** Surgery tomorrow. He has part of his intestine dead due to the above mentioned happenings,False,self,t5_2qjof,1363906129.0,,,t3_1aic9k

To begin celebrating this milestone we would love to hear your bulliest stories.   They can be about your current doggie, endearing and personal stories that might be considered uniquely bully.  To give you guys an idea I'll start:

My Axl and Segan are special because they always have time for me.  They are never ""too busy.""  From the time I come home, they act as if accompanying me is the greatest privilege in the world.  They never grow bored or disinterested with things I introduce them to (fearless and boundless enthusiasm, almost to a fault:).   In retrospect the hardest part of adopting pit bulls has been managing others' fears but  . . . I've learned that there are some people you simply cannot reach and it doesn't make sense to overly dwell on other's prejudices.  This is a life lesson I have been able to apply elsewhere in my life and it has made me happier.

This is my story.  Maybe yours is longer or shorter

A big thank you is owed to all of you for making this community such an incredibly positive place for those that contribute here.
