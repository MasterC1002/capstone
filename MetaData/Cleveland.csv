From there we checked out Euclid and ended up walking down the alley with Pickwick &amp; Frolic - their breads and spreads appetizer was awesome. We explored a little bit more until we decided to call it a night. 

Cleveland is home to the nicest people in the world. We asked for directions and suggestions a few times and everyone was more than happy to help us. We couldn't believe it. We often visit Columbus

I posted about a week ago saying that my girlfriend and I were planning on visiting earlier this week
You redditors really came through and gave us many options

Firstly, Mama Santa's in Little Italy, and another place for dessert (the name escapes me). All three were some of the best food I have ever had.  We also hit the Great Lakes Brewing Company and West Side Market... brought back far too much Ohio beer and cheese.

Secondly, and it wasn't nearly enough time.

Lastly, we had some predispositions of the people we would encounter.. but we had no problems, and interacted with some of the nicest, most helpful people we've met. I really felt like they were going out of their way to make our time in Cleveland the best experience possible.    
 
Anyway, and hope to be back soon!

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was perfect for a music obsessed 13 year old, and just the cool architecture in the city.  Most beautiful public library I've ever seen (yes, the geek boy is into stuff like that).  Really liked the Rain Forest at the zoo. Oh, and we went to Big Fun, and had, well, big fun.

""Dear Beachlanders… 

We want to make a plea to you about buying tickets early… Much like the big Bon Jovi show that just got cancelled at the stadium, please go on line or click through on this newsletter; call us at the office 216-383-1124 Monday-Friday 11-6 and order tickets; or go to one our outlets around the region (Music Saves, Square Records, Heights Guitar, Stebal Drums, Loop and Visible Voice). This will give us and the booking agents a better idea of Cleveland’s energy for a specific artist and actually help us relax a little as we sit here counting tickets and worrying about whether we are going to be able to cover a high guarantee. Advance ticket sales also help us with planning staffing and room set up. We know you can rarely be sure in the concert business. But Cleveland is a challenging market at all levels of this business and it is only ticket sales and music product sales that will show the national music community that we are still a strong music town.

Thanks Cindy and Mark""",self,t5_2qkh0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/1gsi7u/the_owners_of_the_beachland_ballroom_and_tavern/

We are trying to organize a ""resistance"" in response to this. Help.",Craptacular_Idea,81,10,33,"We have just over 24 hours to organize our efforts to support the Parmertor family as they face a protest by the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) at their son, tarps or sheets or anything to block protesters out, and we simply do not have enough time for that. Some pieces of this information was taken from those event pages to save time.

Goal:

To PEACEFULLY assemble at St. Mary's

HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT: 1. PEACEFULLY. This is NOT a protest. This is an assembly. We are not here to show our dislike for the Westboro Baptist Church. We are not here to assault the Westboro Baptist Church. We are not here to voice our opinions on members of the Westboro Baptist Church. We are here to do everything we legally can to help the Parmertor family grieve properly

2. LEGALLY. I can guarantee you that some form of law enforcement will be at this funeral. You will be playing into the Westboro Baptist Church's desires if you assault any member of this organization. A lawsuit is their wet dream.

3. In a perfect world, if they do appear, I want us to surround the front of Saint Mary's Church. We link arms, and DO NOT LET THEM PASS.

4. We will be distributing a lyric sheet to as many as we can, and ""This Little Light of Mine"". Along with the human chain, this will be our form of protest. The goal is to render their hate pointless because it is being drowned out by these simple yet strong songs.

5. When family and friends are entering and exiting the church, sheets whatever we can elevate to block their sight. The combination of our song and these ""curtains"", the family will be able to focus exclusively on laying their son to rest.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT: 1. Rain. Bring an umbrella. 2. Expect to be called a homosexual slur over 1

*****IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE STAY AT LEAST 300 FEET AWAY FROM THE CHURCH AND DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INTERACT WITH THE FAMILY. THIS IS STATE LAW AND WILL BE ENFORCED.******


EDIT: The address of the church is St Mary's Catholic School Chardon



EDIT x2: Mainly the idea of WBC picketing this funeral is that our public schools are teaching violence and sin to our children, so their presence is to be expected. Ideally, they don't show, but we are preparing just in the event they do.


Edit 3: rumors confirmed..WBC contacted the of Chardon to get a permit for that day",self,t5_2qkh0,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/qelxv/there_have_been_rumors_and_tweets_by_the_westboro/

Everyone knows the problems in this city are tremendous

Conversely, line, and sinker. I'm sorry, but that bullshit line that it contributes to the area economy is nonsense. If that were true, this city would have millions of people in the city proper. We have 3 beautiful (again, fully funded by taxpayers) stadiums, and nothing to show for it in terms of population movement.

I guarantee you that NO ONE has moved to this city because of the Browns stadium, people come for Tremont"". Doesn't happen. At least, not in a sustainable way that will dig Cleveland out of this mess.

When I think of moving out of this city, in any part of town and not come across the same 10 stores. It's disgusting to me.

So here's my question to you

While at visiting Edgewater park last week, what impression are these people getting of our city? If I were them and I saw how disgusting that park was, I'd turn around and never come back. For the first time, I was embarrassed for Cleveland.

#### Let's clean it up #####

I'm proposing that we band together to help clean up the city we call home and show Cleveland what we can do - starting with Edgewater. I realize that whomever runs Edgewater will have the place cleaned up in due time

#### How we'll do it #####

Simply put: power in numbers. The more people we have show up to help, a few people bring gloves, that's all the supplies we'll need. If we get 20-30 people there, we could sweep over the entire shoreline in an hour. 

What do you think r/Cleveland?

---------------------------------

**Edit:** The tentative plans will be:

Sunday April 15th @ 11am. Garbage cleanup followed by BBQ, whatever. I'll create a Facebook event soon and post the link. Nearly a month out will get us around Easter, into warmer weather, and plenty of time to spread the word.

What we need to coordinate:

* Who can bring trash bags?
* Who can bring gloves?
* Who can bring hand sanitizer?
* Where can we dump the trash bags after we fill them up?
* Who wants to bring food? i.e. Hot dogs, chips, pop, water, etc.

---------------------------------

**Edit 2:** I'm currently working on coordinating the event with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Once I've got everything worked out with them, please comment or message me. More information to come, stay tuned!

When we got to the door they were handing out little laminated slips

The aquarium itself was very cool. There is a very nice mix of modern looking tanks along with the historic power house structure. Honestly I was not expecting it to be as big or diverse as it was. The lighting in there is very, the sharks were definitely not shy! There was also a pretty cool petting tank that was staffed by 4-5 kids in wet suits. The crowd was mostly mature adults and young children, but there was still a good amount of teenagers and young adults checking it out too. All in all I think it was a great experience and well worth the $22 ticket!

For you out of towners: Make sure you check your map before you get lost driving around in the Flats. The aquarium is in the Power House, be prepared to have to burn some time. Some suggestions in walking distance: McCarthy's Downtown, Harbor Inn Cafe, Shooters on the Water, Flat Iron Cafe (if they ever open the Center Street bridge again...), Carney's Top of the Flats...

TL/DR:
Look at a map so you don't get lost driving around the Flats. Buy your tickets online to skip the line. Be prepared to hang out in the Flats for an hour or two if you come during peak hours.

In case you're not familiar

This time

####The Tentative Details####

When: Sunday

Where: Edgewater Park

What you should bring: Friends and gloves. I'll bring trash bags.

We'll cookout afterwards again. I'll create a Facebook and Google+ event after the date is confirmed. Does anyone see any issues with this date? 

####Spread the Word####

Lots of people ask me how they can get involved with Cleanup Cleveland and I welcome all the help that I can get. The answer is: I need help spreading the word. Plannning it is easy, co-workers, tweet it (#CleanupCLE), Facebook it, Google+ it, write it on the bathroom walls at XYZ, get as many people involved as you can.

If you'd like to get more involved or have ideas for spreading the word

My fiance has been busy designing and developing the [Cleanup Cleveland website](http://cleanupcleveland.org) and we didn't want to release the information without the site available for RSVP. So here we go:

-------------------------------------

**When:** Sunday

**Where:** Edgewater Park in Cleveland

**What:** Garbage cleanup followed by a BBQ

**We Need:** Trash bags, food to grill (hamburgers, hotdogs, buns, etc.), chips, drinks, and napkins. If you can't bring anything

**RSVP:**	By April 12 using the form on the website. Just so we'll know how much supplies to get.

------------------------------------

I'm hoping that we can get a lot of poeple down to Edgewater on the 15th

A little bit about the event: First of all, MCSound DJ. The business will be donating gloves, trash bags, drinks, burgers, hot dogs, water, please contact me. I setup the website so non-redditors can get the information as easily as possible. Most importantly

Lastly, and spread the word via any means possible. Feedback is appreciated, I hope you guys are excited as I am.

I was walking to the home opener from Tremont, asked him if maybe I had left it there. He responded in the negative. I was considering trying to cancel the cards I had information for, but decided to wait until after I got home because of a) terrible reception in the stadium, and b) it could have been at home, still.

Just about midway through the game, logged into my mobile accounts, lo and behold, not a dime had been spent, and when I got home, all cards were present and accounted for. I wouldn't even have been mad if you had taken one of my cards to the gas station and threw some gas in your car, or bought a snack or something. It would be well worth the headache of cancelling cards and having to go get a new driver's license.

I started a new account for this post for privacy reasons. For several months I have been looking around the area for depression/anxiety/mood disorder support groups that cater toward young people but have yet to find anything that seems to do so. I am a 25 year old male in Cleveland Heights who was diagnosed with depression at 18 and chronic anxiety earlier last year. Both my therapist and psychiatrist don't know of any specific groups for young people either and most of the places I've researched are usually for older people, be it at a park, coffee shop, someone's backyard, you get the idea. The environment would be loose and relaxed. I am really excited to see what kind of response this generates, if any. Feel free to message me if you don't want to post in the comments. I hope to hear from you!

P.P.S. Forgive me if this sounds pathetic. It's my first time posting in this subreddit.

Edit: Much better responses than I was gonna get! Apparently ""people who like to have fun"" is a bigger group than I thought it was. I'll be doing some PMing in the next few days.

Edit Edit: Maybe we should have a meetup or something? Is that already a thing?

Edit Edit Edit: The amount of edits in this post is a lot! Seriously, next month or so. This month is a bit rough for me due to unforeseen circumstances. Also, I should probably meet people before opening my apartment up to them, or at least so say my roommates. Again, I did not expect this sort of response. I'm also gotten a ton of PM's which I will attempt to get back to soon. In the meantime, something you all should consider which doesn't involve alcohol is this event: http://www.facebook.com/events/132583556910899/?notif_t=plan_user_invited - you may have to copy and paste as I've had a few and don't care to look up how to properly do that. Or even if it will show up to other people. Otherwise, I will get back to everybody soon. I think that there is also a Facebook group for Cleveland Redditors. Also, I'm bad with paragraphs) my name is Daniel Stemple

Hello my fellow NE Ohioans! Thanks for the enthusiastic response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/1g0khz/can_we_organize_a_protest_in_cleveland/) thread that I posted yesterday. By now I think it is clear we can organize a sizeable rally. If anyone is not up to speed please read these: [r/restorethefourth's intro](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fxm1h/introduction_please_read_this_first/)

What I have heard most is that we need a clear plan and a clear message. First, and it is our essential point. The [fourth amendment](http://imgur.com/fNjIafj) protects us from exactly what the NSA is doing. We have to demand, politely, an end to unreasonable surveillance of Americans' personal effects. I have heard alot of arguments saying that this is somehow not an issue:

* because it has been going on for years (most of us were not adequately informed)
* because if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't be afraid
* because it keeps us safe(it doesn't)
* because it is legal (it shouldn't be)
* or because they say they aren't doing anything with the information. (This doesn't matter at all! If they aren't using the information

We should discuss appropriate responses to all of these. We cannot come off as fringe conspiracy nuts. **Violence, just make sure we stay on point. This is not a legalize pot, 2nd amendment, or anarchist rally.


Now for the plan. The general consensus so far has been that Edgewater Park on the Fourth of July is our best bet. I agree. The area is packed with people and everyone is at their most partriotic. Now, please let me know if you can help in any way.

* Supplies: sign materials, flyers, buttons, stickers, coffee, etc (jakprints will make 2500 4x6 gloss double-sided flyers for 75 bucks).
* Facebook/Twitter pages
* A graphic designer(I am working on this right now)
* People willing to go out and hand out flyers to local businesses(book/record stores
* Speakers(humans not audio equipment)
* Media outreach. I will be emailing Rover(who has already brought up this issue at least 3 times), I know...but he is very LOUD). I honestly don't know where else to go because I don't watch local news. If you have more ideas, say so or just go ahead and do it!
* protest permit

If you are out of town or too busy to help consider donating to the [Restore the Fourth indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/full-page-ad-for-restore-the-fourth) or the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org).

If you have friends or family in politics talk to them.
Here is a petition: [Pardon for the whistleblower](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/pardon-edward-snowden/Dp03vGYD). 
&gt; In such a world, to stop a war, to establish justice, it may be necessary to break the law, to commit acts of civil disobedience, as Southern black did, as antiwar protesters did.

I am certain I forgot a good many important things. Please reply if you notice anything I left out

People come and go but the purpose is to maintain a continued public presence for the community to organize around. 

**What you will find:**

*Anyone who is hungry being fed for free

*Members of the community dropping off food

*Live music

*People meeting each other and sharing interests

*Confused passers-by learning about the camp

*Children writing with sidewalk chalk

*Political discussion that spans the spectrum

*Mutual respect that is quite amazing considering the number of opinions represented. People disagree

*People of all ages


**What you will not find:**

*Police constantly corralling the group 

*Leaders acting without consent from the group

*People hating America (if they did

*People that make you participate in something you disagree with


In sum, and community](http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/210024/45/Cleveland-Public-Square-Occupy-Cleveland-goes-on). 

**Occupy Cleveland is unique in that the city and police are sympathetic because we do not disturb the peace and we clean up after ourselves. We need more people who want to help us keep it that way.** 

The camp is proud of the support they have received from the city and police and believe that maintaining a clean

**What you can do:**

*Donate food. Fruit

*Donate water. 

*Help collect trash. I am helping to collect trash every night

*Campers are always welcome who want to help the camp keep clean and safe.

*Come talk to folks and decide for yourself. Public demonstration isn't for everyone but there are many other ways you can participate.

I constantly hear native Clevelanders complain about the state of their city. They yearn for downtown's glory days and complain about the ""brain drain

Why then

I get it. You've been through some shit. Tough titties. This town is actually really cool, that I want to check out. Most of you don't realize what you have here.

Coming from a walking city

There needs to be some kind of trolley that offers connectivity to all the different hot spots in Cleveland. Have two or three constantly shuttling people between Tremont, East 4th, maybe even Coventry.

The biggest issue is people drive in, more people would be willing to live downtown. It's about the comfort of having other people around you doing the same things you're doing.

Fill one (or all) of them out! You can use any of the templates I've provided or you can create your own... print it out, make it in Photoshop.

This is your subjective view of Cleveland. It can be anything. It could be a map of your favorite bars, or first date locations, or it can even be places you'd never go because you don't want to die. Be creative! They don't have to be perfect or anything; they can just be generalized locations. If you're feeling really ambitious, you can make multiple maps for different topics.

Edit: Okay I feel like it will be easiest just to turn this into a reddit meetup post -- Anyone familiar with the Barking Spider? I love that place, but permissible to bring in. I usually get pizza or something and bring it with me when I go there. Address: 11310 Juniper Rd  Cleveland, OH 44106 


And finally, your advances will not be welcome at this particular event :-)

EDIT: So unfortunately I have had an emergency come up at work and will sadly not be able to attend my own event -- yes, OP has not delivered etc etc

BUT: I think everyone should still go, I would like to reschedule this for my own benefit next Thursday if anyone is interested? I will be there anyway. If anyone shows that'd be awesome haha.

I'm hoping that somewhere in the great subreddit of Cleveland there are some council members, lawyers, urban planners, and generally sound consultants that can help me work this idea into something feasible.  

Conversely feel free to shoot it down and explain why it won't work

I call my idea

In order to increase the popularity of the RTA Rapid Transit Lines and to increase and encourage development of culturally significant areas along green, and safe transportation, and to increase the popularity of said RTA Lines while setting the long term goal of increased city revenues the citizens of Reddit propose the following:

1- Any business (gallery, store, theater, video arcade, laser tag, putt putt course, bowling alley, screen printing shop

2- In the event that an already established company opens a satellite location (IE Great Lakes Brewing Company decides to open a cafe in West Park) the main center benefits from a 1 year abatement in addition to the new business initiatives presented above.

3- In addition by working with local lending institutions (I'm looking at you Fifth Third and US Bank) we will endeavor to offer low interest loans to qualified candidates who present the required small business documentation and support.  These loans will be specially structured and encouraged to support the investments of the young, etc) who have ambition, credentials, drive, but not necessarily sufficient capital to revitalize our great city

4- The city council of Cleveland and appropriate suburbs will work together to simplify, studio space, or bowling alleys.

5- After the property tax abatements expire tax revenues generated by the business opened under the GCRRRI will be used exclusively and wholly for the development, Beachland Ballroom area, Coventry, etc)


This is a basic outline of what I'm thinking.  Feel free to go nuts on it.  Please don't steal it and submit it and become famous for saving Cleveland without me.  Also sorry for the length of this.

TL;DR - If you're too lazy to read it you probably won't be of any help.

* Curb lane will be bus only lane during rush hour
* 10-minute frequency for busses during rush hour
* New 60' buses similar to healthline
* New traffic lights to give buses priority
* Many new bus stops in both Lakewood and Cleveland
* Cleveland side is being repaved!
* Cleveland side will have a new median with landscaping in the middle
* Cleveland side's road will be widened by two feet.
* Cleveland side's lights will be replaced with metal poles with mast arms.
* Two lanes of traffic on both sides (not a problem

I think this has the potential to be very pretty and improve the area a lot. I have a few concerns:

* Light timing. They botched the light timing for cars on Euclid.
* Parking in Lakewood. Like the Cleveland side
* No room for a park and ride in Lakewood. People living on the south side of Lakewood won't be able to take as good advantage of this. I would love to drive from Madison to a parking lot on Clifton and take the bus from there. Right now

If they can nail the light timing, and downtown. I know many people that don't take the bus to work because during rush hour it's way too crowded and it also doesn't run extremely late for sports games. I'm guessing it will run more often at night as well.

Then two phenomenal citizens helped me push my car to a pump. I tried to buy both of them 6 packs as a thank you. Both tried to say no. One of them was pumping gas so I basically forced it on him. The second one however was across the street near the chipotle parking lot and ran off when I could only give him a handshake. Who is this real-life dark night?!?!?!?! He was driving a white car (too far away to tell make or model)

1346470626.0,z65w3,Portlander settling in to Cleveland - Thoughts so far,Awesomus_Prime,25,7,32,"I moved here recently and I have a few things I would like to say.

First off

The weather is very similar to the NW with the exception of a slight lake smell (After a few weeks i quit smelling it) and humidity. Also

The food is large and for the most part tasty. Being in beer and wine country has spoiled me

I have noticed that drivers here are a little selfish. It is almost like they dare you to hit them. Where I'm from

The streets in many places are shit

Cleveland is VERY car friendly though. A traffic jam here is nothing compared to Portland. This leads me to my next point.... Public Transportation appears to suck ass here. 

Homeless people seem not to exist here

Employment rocks here. Since I have arrived

Weed

Overall
