1356810116.0,15mwsb,"Hello /r/socialengineering, I posted this originally in /r/confession, but they felt it would fit in better here. WARNING: Wall of text, but worth the read!",tweakofnature,104, I stole my very first DVD which was ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time

* Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager.
3:30pm
* During this time, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted.
* Once completed I would do a ""fake transaction"" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card.
* After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my ""bag"" at a later time.

This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it.

At the store I worked in, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. 

Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared ""Cash or credit"", the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause.

My General Manager only checked the cash totals, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. 

So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34

You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall.

Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything

A loaded question is a question  which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. 

Example:

The question ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, then the question is loaded.

Since this example is a yes/no question
	1. ""Yes
	2. ""No
	
The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say ""I have never beaten my wife."" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, let me explain how this came to an end for me.

October 19, and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect

At the end of the night, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said ""No."" But it wasn't a suspicious ""no."" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work.

**The distraction principle:** While you are distracted by what retains your interest

**The social compliance principle:** Most civilized culture trains people to adhere to perceived societal rules. Social Engineers know how to use social pressures and our desire to fit in against out better judgement. 

**The herd principle:** Even suspicious marks will let their guard down when everyone next to them appears to share the same risks. Safety in numbers? Not if they’re all conspiring against you. 

**The dishonesty principle:** Anything illegal you do will be used against you by the fraudster

**The deception principle:** Things and people are not what they seem. Hustlers know how to manipulate you to make you believe that they are.

**The need and greed principle:** Your needs and desires make you vulnerable. Once hustlers know what you really want

The method I'm about to outline is **NOT** the only one, and with some creativity, can be applied even to people you've known a long time.

I'm talking about **F.O.R.M.**

**F**amily
**O**ccupation
**R**ecreation
**M**essage

When meeting someone new, here are some areas we all have common ground.

**FAMILY**

Whether we have a family, or share a family, we all have an opinion on it. Families can be motivators, they can be stressors, they can be a great many types of stimuli on a person. Talking about your family can be a great ice-breaker, and timed with a great question, can get your new friend talking for hours. 

**OCCUPATION**

This covers school as well, everyone wants to talk about how awful, or, occasionally, how awesome work was. Listen to their motivators, their ""why""s and empathize with them on the subject of work. If they enjoy their career, get interested, find ways to hate it together

**RECREATION**

Build them back up, and if you're knowledgeable on the subject, DON'T INTERJECT. Its their time shine, this is about them. They get to be the star of their own show, and you are the faithful audience, gripped with anticipation the whole time. 

**MESSAGE**

This is your message. This is where you tie everything you've learned so far into what you want from them. If your goal is to get them to buy your product

""Its so awesome you've taken your health seriously. Your family will thank you for the extra time they'll get to spend with you. Listen

Note that this is a random as hell example, ""Buy this,"" or ""Let me in free,"" or ""Give me all your money."" Its a chance to use the information you've gathered about them to get them interested in you, and willing to learn more. Sometimes, you may want an informant or a friend, or you may just be trying to build rapport.

""I totally agree, you should let me add you on Facebook, do you want my email or can I get yours, so I can find you?""

In sales, that way success or failure is your hands, not theirs. This is a great way to get an informant's number or their facebook, in this day and age. And with your new rapport, its possible you'll have a future customer, new friend, or source of dirty secrets in no time at all.

1.) I carry dog treats with me. To avoid looking like I'm trying too hard for the tip

2.) On my way to the door

Some examples: 
Sports Team paraphernalia -- flags, etc. to talk about, root for, or suggest. I've gotten great tips during the final four tournament doing this. 

College Paraphernalia -- same stuff^ but different topics. Can approach them about sports; I have claimed that their school is where I am attending (which has been true the times I have used it). 

3.) I compliment them on their property. Sometimes this opens them up for a little small talk and I can schmooze them for a friendlier relationship before they tip.

4.) Ask about the car in their driveway, etc. This is just an opportunity to get friendly and for them to warm up.

5.) I always ask about their pets. Usually I am greeted by a dog and its owner. I tell them it's a pretty dog. What kind is it? What's his/her name? He looks like a good dog. He's just jealous of the food. No

6.) Sometimes children try to greet or talk to me. I show interest in what they are saying while the transaction is happening; don't ignore them. Sometimes parents appreciate that.

7.) ALWAYS be polite. Yes

The way I see it, I wasn't born with ""charm"", but I think I was born with an attitude to be socially stringent, to listen more so rather than to speak in a conversation. USUALLY people like that kind of attitude, and through out my life, I believe that listening to other people will generally make you more likeable, but still not ""charming"".

Charm can be summed up as a low level mind control technique. Sure you don't have to be charming to have people LIKE you, what does it takes to be charming EXACTLY? Is it a quality or a technique WITHIN a quality? 

I can first tell you that charm is not directly linked with ""good looks"" body-feature wise. Perhaps charm is linked more so being clean and well kept

The next part of charm that I have noticed is your smile! There is no doubt that this is a major role in being charming. Having a genuine smile

When not in person, without heaps of misspellings and being grammatically correct, but to the point where your language is so rigid that you sound like a robot. Using and playing with the English language as a tool, rather than just a communication device will net you admiration. Devise your own style of speech pattern, but don't deviate too much from the norm. Throw in some quarks, but don't let it be tacky or white-knighty. Picture a pimply faced fedora wearing teenager that speaks in that awful ""medieval"" speech pattern to their damsels who apparently are in distress. That is exactly the opposite of charm. In fact; that is a perfect example of trying too hard. If communicating electronically, it's been said before, but it still works between friendships. Just be sure to know when you're flirting and when you're being friendly.

:)  :&gt;  :V are some favorites of mine. They work very well. ;)

Body language is just as important too. Use your hands to accentuate what you are trying to say. Make it very subtle if you are speaking to someone normally, instead, exaggerate your arms and eyes to tell the story, stand up if you have to! Facial emotion counts just as much!

And I don't believe you can be charming without a teeny tiny little bit of cockiness. Not in the vein as being an arrogant asshole


Okay, just some bits and pieces that I have in my head at the time, but I'm curious... What do you guys think charm is and means? Please share your stories of how it got you an upper hand, and your techniques. Did you learn how to be charming or did it come natural?

Now

* First, **his email**: mhonan@gmail.com
* Then, they knew his address was **mhonan@me.com**, and they had to gain control of his Apple Account. **Honan fail:** Two factor auth should be turned on.


* So they targeted his Amazon account instead! They grabbed **his address** from the whois info of emptypage.com, this was they key to everything else.
* Then, billing address, and last 4 digits of *any* card number associated with the account. **Amazon fail:** they should require the card to have been ""validated"" by a successful payment/delivery. If they had done so, the card would have needed to be valid, and an unknown purchase made by a card you don't own is a big red flag.

* Now they have access to the Amazon account. From it

* Finally, last four digits of credit card. Done. **Apple fail:** a credit card number is pretty much public information. Even more so the last four digits. (Fun fact: on credit card payment receipts, the masking of the CC number is inconsistent, sometimes the middle, sometimes the ends, so you can basically reconstruct it from various receipts left in, for instance

From there, and wipe all devices associated with the AppleID.

Con-men got their name from confidence. Not for the confidence they carried themselves with

The social engineer requires the same tools. To get someone to believe in you, how they live etc. is right. Doubt, you see, is what we rely on as humans to keep us alive. Was that a rustle in the bushes? Could it be a predator? Best check to be sure. Most times this reaction will result in nothing, but when it is correct, it is our saving grace. The mark, therefore, must have such confidence in his belief

""Excuse me, ""could you help me get to King st.?"" The question of whether or not this man is serious never enters your mind, you can help him. You're confidant of that. This is the [Ben Franklin Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect). Once you've helped a person, you become more confidant in your ability to help them again, and the question of their motives never cross your mind.

This is the first step of any social engineering

**TRUST**

A man walks into an office building carrying a box. Long strides, everything about him says he has a purpose. People trust it. A man who is trusted is a man allowed. To gain trust, you must establish a non-malicious purpose. A motive which easily explains your story. A man with flowers in an office building? A clipboard outside of a house? An orange vest on the side of the road? Each tells a trustworthy story. 

Words are the riskiest way to get trust. People often say what they mean

**WORD PLAY**

Even when trust is garnered

Most people wouldn't give such odd speech a second thought, 90% of people are not our competitors. They are too entwined in their own games, their own lives, to even consider the insignificant nature of our own goals. The moral is to speak as little as possible, but that's not the subject of our final lesson.

**PARANOIA**

Knowing these three steps leads

Just kidding. If you read that and were mildly annoyed by my grammatical errors, you likely saw me as a bit less intelligent from the get go. In this post, I'm going to run down a few styles I've noticed and how they can be applied to present yourself differently by only altering your text. This obviously requires no facial expression, body language, etc., because it is an incredibly restricted medium. I won't really be going over word choice or sentence fluency as much as I will be going over deliberately breaking these rules, and how the patterns created affect the reader.

Perfect spelling, simple, and default to most people. While some use it while communicating with friends, it seems a bit formal to me. This type of language is best used whenever you can spare casuality - use it when talking to any higher ups in the office, any family members, and basically anyone you would want to impress.

but now if i talk without capitalization amongst a few other missing pieces of punctuation, or basically less intelligent this way, but if you present yourself well with a nice vocabulary, no blatantly bad spelling errors, and no horrible sounding sentences, the juxtaposition can have an opposite effect and will make you sound more intelligent. it frames the conversation differently. i am no longer a textbook reciting facts, i am now a guy speaking intelligently over the internet. did you notice the fact that i used a comma when i couldve used a semicolon up there? sometimes you can ignore question marks as well. see what i mean. this style should not use any exclamation marks though. you seem calm this way. you're not worried about appearing intelligent

NEVER USE ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE SHOUTING. THIS DOES NOT ADD EMPHASIS AS MUCH AS IT MAKES YOU LOOK LOUD.

Frequent use of elipses... makes you seem foolish I guess... can make you seem indecisive... it just sounds like you're trailing off... this should be avoided as well.


Punctuation overall has a massive effect on the reader. Ending a sentence with a period in perfect grammar is standard. Ending a period in lowercase mode emphasizes the point a bit more. Ending an all caps sentence adds a lot of emphasis but you are still coming off as confrontational because of the Internet shouting. Question marks don't always have to be used with questions. They can sow a lack of confidence or confusion. ""I'm already in that menu?"" when asking about tech support. ""You're already signed in though?"" when somebody posts about how they're having login issues. Similarly

Who the hell cares.

or

who the hell cares.

Seem a bit different. The second one sounds a lot more laidback.

Exclamation mark! These can be used for excitement! Do not combine with lowercase style unless you know what you're doing.

""yay!"" can come off as juvenile, ""yay!"" It sounds more laidback than, ""Yay!"" for reasons we've already discussed. Simply saying ""Yay."" has an adverse effect. It makes you sound sarcastic. That applies to periods used in almost all normally happy sounding phrases. Hooray. Woohoo. Fun.

Now, there's [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12siib/my_most_aggravating_grammatical_pet_peeve_is_when/) on askreddit right now. A few examples:

1. Talking Like This Is Really Quite Obnoxious Because The Reader Has To Wonder Why You're Capitalizing The First Letter Of Every Word. This Takes Effort. Laziness Would Be Understandable, The Voice In Your Head Adds An Upward Inflection At Every Word. Gah! Annoying!

2. ThIs Is JuSt BlAtAnTlY aNnOyInG aNd MaKeS yOu LoOk LiKe YoU'rE tWeLvE. pLuS

3. mispell evryday wurds cn be anoying, it gets ovious.

4. Choppy sentences. Makes you hesitate. I picture an Asian guy. Chop. Chop.

5. Run on sentences can be particularly annoying

6. LOL! OMG! Capitalizing Internet speak abbreviations

Now, the reader will be annoyed at you as well. The right combination of spelling mistakes, missing commas, and other abbreviations can add to a personal style that many people have. For example, many teenage girls talk like this:

""i mean idk hes just cute ig

Took your advice yesterday and had great success.,FulminatedMercury,93,15,22,"So I read a while back here that certain personality traits have their weaknesses. One that stuck out with me was that people who are insecure are susceptible to flattery. The guy that is always talking about how great he is at everything can be given a few compliments and instantly he's social engineered into doing something. Well I am amazed. Not only did it work but it exceeded my expectations. 


So I was wondering

**Edit: Only took a bit more surfing to find what I was looking for. Wikipedia has a great page on psychological manipulation.** - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation

**Common vulnerabilities**


**Naïveté** - victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning


**Over-conscientiousness** - victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their side of things in which they blame the victim


**Low self-confidence** - victim is self-doubting


**Over-intellectualization** - victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some understandable reason to be hurtful.


**Emotional dependency** - victim has a submissive or dependent personality. The more emotionally dependent the victim is


**Too trusting** - people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials


**Too altruistic** - the opposite of psychopathic; too honest


**Too impressionable** - overly seduced by charmers. For example


**Too naïve** - cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world or if there were they would not be allowed to operate.


**Too masochistic** - lack of self-respect and unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt.


**Too insecure** – those with oversized egos are overly susceptible to flattery


**Too narcissistic** – these types suffer from the constant pain of nobody else paying them enough attention. A simple “I was thinking of you when…” can work wonders. Narcissists are also prone to falling for unmerited flattery.


**Too greedy** - the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way.


**Too immature** - has impaired judgment and believes the exaggerated advertising claims.


**Too materialistic** - easy prey for loan sharks or get-rich-quick schemes


**Too dependent** - dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no.


**Too lonely** - lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price.


**Too impulsive** - make snap decisions about


**Too frugal** - cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason why it is so cheap


**The elderly** - the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone with a hard-luck story. 

**The ""disease to please""**

**Addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others**

**Emotophobia** (fear of negative emotion)

**Lack of assertiveness and ability to say no**

**Blurry sense of identity** (with soft personal boundaries)

**Low self-reliance**

**External locus of control**

Anyway, without anything. I also got a £20 ticket to the Olympics closing ceremony and got into the seats that were exclusively for the big time sponsors - to give you an idea, I sat next to the UK McDonalds heads, and I took the photo of a Samsung head for him. The seats had a value of £2.5k each. I also used the same tactics for getting very nice (often front row) Olympic seats.


Firstly

I'm gonna warn you now

For the festival, I wanted to get backstage, so I simply got in roughly the middle of the group of 6 (far enough from both ends to get the security at hopefully their minimum observation level), maintained a look and posture of confidence, but not so much as to draw attention. When it was my turn, I flashed my wrist briefly enough for them to see vaguely the right colour wristband, but not to be able to inspect too closely. I can't remember what I did with my eyes. Writing this, or look at somewhere other than the wrist. I think probably a combination

Olympics again, to my legit seat, to scout the area and level of security a little. Then, I went downstairs, and used the toilet (I knew it would be my last chance for a few hours) then filled a bottle of water to the brim. I removed the cap, and put it in my pocket. Oh, darn! Looks like with a phone in one hand and a full, I couldn't reach my ticket without spilling water everywhere.

There were two sets of security, used the fake call function on my phone so it'd ring, then pretended to talk on it, until the security were distracted with someone who was confused. I just acted like I was supposed to be in there, walked to the left of the confused people (but not fully in) and stood on the left side of some people that were getting their tickets checked, one step ahead of them, to give the impression that I'd already had my ticket checked. I stopped fairly deliberately, acting like there was a particularly interesting part of my call. As they started to go

The second was easier. The stadium was circular, wait until they're about to have their ticket inspected, sneak up the side, take a seat. After that point, all was fine, I was in, so no need to worry anymore. I got chatting with the execs and was totally open about it. 1 person asked if they could switch seats so they could be next to their wife

If anyone wants to ask anything

Proof: (Festival, I didn't take any pictures on the stage - however you can see the lanyards &amp; blue wristbands, as well as someone getting interviewed for the BBC on one of the benches) http://i.imgur.com/3nmIQKe.jpg

To start, meaning it'll work at college bars, but higher-end bars usually won't let me in. 

Anyway, I would have to drive home that night, and there was just no real incentive. Everyone else with me (6 or 7 people) was 21.

We get to the bar, obviously. Anyway, I'm drinking water and everyone else is having some mixed drink. I'm feeling lame and childish. We were seated in the back of the bar, out of eyesight from the bouncer. I assumed that the bouncer hadn't told our waitress I wasn't 21, why would he? There were others at the bar who weren't 21, and he has other things to do. So, I try to order a drink

""Yes I am""

"" The guy at the front said you weren't""

At this point I'm thinking 'shit, I have my ID right here"", I show her my ID. She accepts it and apologizes. 

5 minutes later and my supervisor points to our waitress, and I'll be humiliated'. Of course, it's too late to turn back now.

The bouncer comes up to me. I'm laughing and pretend I'm enjoying myself. He taps me on the shoulder and says, and say ""I'm not sure what you're talking about, I have my ID right here."" I pull out my wallet, not breaking eye contact. I'm smiling slightly, to come off as confident. He takes my ID and looks at it, looks back at me (I'm holding his gaze), he asks why I said I wasn't 21 earlier, I don't know what you're talking about, looks at the ID, a few people from other tables are watching. He gives me back my ID

Next thing I know the waitress comes around and gives me a drink on the house ""I'm sorry again sir!"". 

Moral of the story: Even if you're freaking out internally (my heart was pounding out of my chest), you lose all credibility), maintain eye contact (it comes off as confrontational, and 9/10 the person on the receiving end of your eye contact won't want any confrontation), and put the other party on the defensive, make them make a decision.",,,,

1353655920.0,13nqi5,Con Games in Virtual Space. A brief look into the EVE Online scamming scene,LetMeExplain,73,12,7,"EVE Online is a unique game in that not only do scams occur regularly, many players living in the safe confines of high security space spend their time blissfully ignorant of the myriad of different cons out in the game universe. Players run missions for factions for in game money, guilds

1. When you lose a ship in eve online
2. The game is notoriously complex
3. Everyone wants more of something, better npcs to shoot at and make money off of, better opportunities for pvp on a large and organized scale, and better modules to fit on their ships. Basically, there are dozens of ways you can hook people into a con. 

With that

**The Recruitment scam:**

This is the scam I have the most experience with by far. The hook is that you find a player looking for a new corporation to join, exactly what it is that your corp does is right in line with what they do, but you have access to premium resources which will make them more money than they could imagine. During this process you aquire the players full api key, a gadget that gives you a complete look at the players assets, wallet, mails, transactions, and all other aspects of their in game character. The sinker is that you either 

a. require a security deposit to hold as collateral in case they are a spy (one part of the meta game aiding another) or awoxer (a player who joins for the soul purpose of killing fellow unsuspecting corp members)
 
b. you could forego the security deposit and instead offer them free shipping of their assets to your sovereign space, and no two are the same from eachother, nor should they be. The meat of this con is in the line, building the illusion that you live in paradise, and they could too if they do what you say. Again, there are many aspects to the scam, ive even incorporated other scams within this one such as the Boxing scam or the Glim dropper at one point or another. [Here] (http://themittani.com/news/alod-gullible-aeon) is an example of a scam I pulled recently that was somewhat newsworthy. 


**The Pile of Items/ Misrepresentation scam**

This scam is similar to the money making machine scam. The hook is to make a post on the market forums for the game, including the cheapest versions of popular rare ship modules to give the list legitimacy. The point is to amass such a large amount of crap, making it difficult for people to gauge the value of the items. After that it is a matter of being contacted by prospective marks, giving false time constraints, and giving them as little time as possible for them to review the contract and decide. 

**The isk doubling scam**

This is probably the most commonly seen scam in the game, name dropping inactive players to give the scam legitimacy. 

**The contract scam**

Also a widely popular scam, without selling the ship itself. There is no line, simply throwing out bait and hope to catch a gullible sucker to hit accept on your bogus offer. The brilliant part of this scam is that it requires little effort, and bogus offers are mixed in with legitimate offers in local chat, being a trade hub and all. 

All in all, founder of the largest soverign alliance in the game, owns over 3 regions of space, and allows members to scam; with the caveat that they do not use their Dreddit character for recruitment scams, this is easily circumvented by making a new character and placing them in a Player alt corp within the alliance (a collection of corporations under the same banner). Outside of recruitment scams, Dreddit members are allowed to do any other kind of scam they can think of as long as you are not scamming someone within the alliance or an ally. So if any of you young and enterprising social engineers want to refine your skills, please feel free to join in on the fun

This is not meant to be a definitive list of cons for EVE online, the older the trick the easier it is to pull.

I want to talk about legal moneymaking - although not necessarily ethical - businesses that have a fair amount of potential.

To start off, like any good scam, the odds are heavily balanced towards whoever's running the business.

The basic premise of these as it's sold to the customers is that you can get valuable items like an iPad, say, $500, and every bid drives the price down. The price it ends at is the price it sells for. So if the new iPad starts at $500 but the winning bid is just $23, that's the selling price. As you can imagine, this shit is very addictive.

The genius of these for the individual(s) behind them is that you charge for each bid. Let's say each bid costs $2 and drives the price of the item down by $1 to keep things simple for our example. So that iPad that went down from $500 to $23 actually made $954 for the seller. Assuming $500 is the true retail value

Then of course you have the payday loan companies that charge you 2

Put different amounts of money, so you have better negotiating leverage.  

Pockets should contain: $3, $20.... and then ""hide"" the rest somewhere else.

So now you come upon an object you like. If the price $12 but you want to pay $10, get money from the $10 pocket and the $5 pocket.... etc.

Once that transaction is done

You can also ""plant"" additional money on your friend/spouse in the same way.

Pro version: If you're buying several things, and proceed with the technique above...  ""Will you take $20 for all of it?""

It turns out[*] that he failed to install a fire alarm amongst other lesser issues

Some internet sluething suggests that I must show that I must have already given the landlord written notice (by letter

I want to present him with a written demand

I would very much appreciate your suggestions.

 I thought of discussing it verbally with him

I am aware of the difficulities, and is almost a caricature of Mr. Krabbs from Spongebob Squarepants! I am hoping that it would not be too difficult to persuade him that he can get away with doing nothing if I choose my approach carefully. 

**EDIT:** Some ideas I just had:

* It did occur to me that I could phrase the letter as an inquiry (please sir, it will hold up as evidence that I gave the landlord written notice that it is missing, even if I don't explicitly demand that he fix it. It would definititely give the him the impression that he could ride roughshod over me, essentially acting weak to get him to lower his guard. 

* In line with the above theme, it may also contribute an impression that the letter isn't serious. 

* I could also push it through his lettterbox instead of posting it?

* Feign ignorance of the law by including something such as ""I'm not sure what the rules for this are..""?

I'm looking foward to your ideas!

""I call it 'Expanding into the power vacuum'"" Demara explained. ""It works this way.

Get there fast, and be polite. Give them helpful tips about where you work if you can. That's all. You can't coax people into giving you a better trip by being friendly if you're a delivery guy. Also consider that the more time you spend chatting, the later you'll be for the next delivery, the fewer tips you'll get. The only exception is if they initiate it chatting or flirting.
I don't get why people in this reddit keep suggesting being overly friendly and chatty in places where it's generally (though of course with exceptions) inappropriate or unwelcome. It takes people outside their comfort zones or annoys them

How do you make the men/women in your life think and feel beautiful?

Apart from the on-the-job related aspects of SE
Coming from a male perspective - mine - When at a party, but FEEL beautiful. Women spend alot of time on their appearance and I would argue many men do as well. How do we show them we appreciate it?

The trick is tailoring your approach in a manner relative to your relationship with that person

Eye contact
A very important action to remember when dealing with anyone! It shows not only that you see them, sincerity. Its no secret that prolonged eye contact between two people, especially between men and women (and especially in an appropriate scenario) can signal interest, usually towards romance.

Eye contact was an easy one (and I didn't write enough about it to really flesh out its true power in social interactions) but we all know it is the basic tool that needs to be used to get the full effect of any other tip.

Now I'm in the middle of reading [Hadnagy's very interesting book](http://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineering-Art-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539).  So

Despite not knowing what social engineering was until a few days ago, and other interesting books in the past, and I recently read [Instant Influence](http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Influence-How-Anyone-Anything--Fast/dp/0316083348/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325221148&amp;sr=1-1), which I'd like to discuss, despite its corny promise that you can get anyone to do anything in 7 minutes...that's bullshit.  Essentially, the book says when you're trying to get someone to do something you should make sure they know that it's up to them to do ""x"", and then you ask them a series of questions to determine how likely it is they will do ""x"".  For example, ""On a scale of 1 to 10 how likely are you to do 'x'?""  Then the follow-up question is

Okay, I kept the 1 - 10 scale, but I prefaced it with, ""sorry, I know this is cheesy"").  I think the honesty worked, and overall it was successful.  He has since made positive changes in the way I wanted him to change; he's more ethically conscious in a general sense; he's less selfish and self-directed; and he now gets along with his father (my uncle).  

My qualms with the book is that it's written like a motivational speaking event

I'm not sure if I did this ""field report"" properly, I will give them (unless they're too personal).  Anyway, I thought I'd get the ball rolling, and I hope others will do field reports.  Anecdotal evidence is always fun.  :)

 * Make conversation with 5 strangers
 * Make eye contact with each stranger and try to remember their eye color.
 * If you forget someone's eye color
 * Take notes and save them for later.
 
Once you complete this set of tasks, don't do your basic hygiene (shower, shave, deodorant, etc) Post the results of both of these activities.

Some protips:
 
 * If you are a shy person, deli counter clerks, etc. No kidnapping!) If you are going to be doing this, try to interact a bit more with the person, ask them a question unrelated to what they are doing for you. Compliment them on something, ask if it's been busy, $sports_team's success/failure
 * Try to be pleasant with strangers. People generally are friendly unless you are acting strangely
 * Know when to leave a conversation
 * Have fun! If you aren't having fun doing this
 
If you are feeling bold or you are experienced

 * Find out each person's name and profession. 
 * Find out a hobby that this person has.
 * Gather information I haven't mentioned, whatever. This is a hard one, basically get as much info as you can out of the person without appearing weird.
 * Include all these in your reply.

[What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro](http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344819660&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+every+body+is+saying)


I read Liespotting a few months back, I got it wrong.  After that, I have been able to guess the lie except for one other time.  I've done this game about twenty times, so I'd say my accuracy is actually higher than what most deception detection results reveal.  I think this is because the game I made up is a lot easier than detecting deception in the real world.  Nevertheless, Liespotting helped me view things from a better perspective.  You don't really have to read the later chapters in the book unless you are in business.  Chapters 1-4 will teach you what you need to know.



What Every Body is Saying showed up in a thread here in which pentestscribble, but WEBiS is a better book.  Even while I was reading it, I started trying out the techniques and found they worked.  



For example, I could tell she was uncomfortable and a little bit happy to be talking to this person.  They were close in the past, and she knew I was watching, so it wasn't surprising that she was giving mixed body language signals.  



Another example is that I was speaking to a new acquaintance (x) about one of her friends, when another person (y) entered into the conversation and started critiquing x, x started using placating techniques (petting her legs) and one hand was clenched into a fist (indicating anger) for a good portion of y's critique of x.  It was fascinating.  



For anyone who wants to detect deception, WEBiS is better about demonstrating why deception is hard to detect, and it uses better visual aids to demonstrate ideas than Liespotting.  



Liespotting cites more examples to scientific studies, I am skeptical of certain portions of WEBiS because some parts (particularly with tells of the hands) don't have any science behind them.

Considering that i was also in the STEM program, i had decided to ""help out"" with some of the tours today, discreetly. As my second period class ended, and the lunch/free period began, i rushed out to my car and drove to the kmart near the school. There, i bought a clipboard, a pair of glasses, the glasses were an extra touch, there was a whole new group of kids here for the orientation which made my job that much easier. Instead of having to work my way into the list of the current tour guides

I ran into the office dedicated to the program's department with a small slip of blank paper functioning as my ""hallway pass"", all ready for next year's freshmen. I didn't have the time to drive home to get mine so i grabbed a large sized polo and tossed it into an empty box. I was already wearing khaki pants so my uniform was complete. I walked out of the office carrying the empty box containing my polo (pretending it was heavy) and thanked the secretary at the front desk. I ran back to my car, changed, put on my glasses, and my landyard, with, once again, but not enough for someone to see the whole thing. I walked into school with the clipboard in hand, this prevented me from sticking out like a sore thumb as i made my way to the auditorium lobby where the rest of the tour guides stood, i said that the head of the program asked me to fill in for someone for the second half of the day because they would be short of tour guides. Nobody asked for credentials or even my last name (luckily)

We got our groups assigned and i did about 6-7 tours around the building. Being in the program myself, a pair of glasses, and a landyard. 
(Don't worry ill return the shirt)

I'd like to thank this subreddit for teaching me how to look the part and bullshit my way through serious situations to get what i want.

The other day I posed something regarding some social behavior that I had experienced and that I fond weird](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/zbz4q/why_do_people_get_angry_at_math/).  No need to check the original post

What was interesting to me
In short

Which blew me away.  The study highlighted and confirmed what I had observed: people would vocally defend their wrong position

Wait

*We also document several instances of a “backfire effect” in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.*

Of course I see this though my own lens
I grew up introvert and shy, I was also insecure; actually I believe that shy if a form of being insecure; so I should say that I grew up introvert and insecure.  I am still introvert, but not that shy anymore, and not that insecure either, probably because I know a lot, and... I don't talk about stuff that I don't know.

And that's what puzzles me about the incident that I observed, and very loudly defending their (wrong) position.

I have seen it happen a lot in business, and promotion by arrogant people who talk the talk, very loudly so, and not much more.

And I have seen these very same people who are introvert and shy and *in the know* working really hard for not much pay, would be.... out of work.

And because of the work I do, become entrepreneurs and despite themselves, striking it reach on the shoulders of shy and introvert people.

So

And if we were to take someone like this, is this what constitute the majority of successful entrepreneurs who strike it rich in spite of themselves?

* Ask for examples. If they have to give the thought to provide an example

Someone in my life and home is in an unfortunate position of being able to ruin my life and possibly make me homeless.  Tonite I came home and found myself locked out of access to my possessions in a shared part of the abode that I live in.  Parked nearby the house was a rent-a-truck that was the PERFECT size for carrying away my stuff.  (Yes I am completely up on my rent agreement).  

I immediately wrote down all the information that was on the truck, etc. - then called the cops.

The moment it was obvious to the perpetrator that the cops were coming, called someone, and the truck zoomed off.

The suspicious person gave the cops plausible deniability (claimed they were storing valuable stuff for someone else and wanted to lock that room for a day).  The perp left no notice letting me know that.   The  cop did a good job of calming both the scary person down (for now) and explaining that he thought was just a civil case.  The only shred of proof otherwise would be that magically disappearing truck.  Yes, it was waaaaay too much of a coincidence.

Since I have the license place, for all I know it was rented with a stolen credit card or whatever, but I need a place to start.

If any social-engineering genius could either explain how to call the truck company and get the identity of the real renter out of the truck-rental company

My next step after this would be to somehow be able to flee the perpetrator and the unhealthy living situation

For example

I looked up 'reverse engineer' but this means something different. Would a generic term like 'systems hacking' be a good one?

Social engineering is systems hacking but pertains to the human element instead of inanimate things. 

Also

-All systems are finite and therefore have a finite capacity. Once this capacity is reached within a system then it no longer can function properly and is prone to errors. This causes vulnerabilities in the system that can be exploited.

-All systems are human constructs and are models that exist only in the human mind. The human mind is limited in its perception of all the nuances of a given system. In fact

-All systems are dependent on its smaller parts so much so that an error in one miniscule aspect of the system can crash the system. Put another way

This is great, because you have your bigger problems under control.

A simple application of this is self-deprecating jokes. But they are too obvious and are seen right through. They are like facebook selfies of a girl who spent the time to put on makeup, to finally post and say, ""OMG, I'm so ugly"" to garner sympathy. What I am saying is not say self-deprecating lines, but BE almost self-defeating, conflicted, and self-deprecating.

i.e. You just received a new promotion. Say you got a new promotion, and you hate managing people. But how can you refuse a $30,000 increase to your salary?? Gain sympathy. Brag more. Rinse, Repeat. The bottom line is, you are overtaking those who earn less than you, but you do not want to be hated.

Another example: You just got into an ivy league college. Show negative aspects of it: ""Fucking rich ass people in ivy leagues

This solves many problems: those who resent you will feel better about themselves

This also lends itself to usage of the Benjamin Franklin effect. Want to get closer to a new buddy? Take him out to lunch and vent your problems. Ask for his advice on how to handle ""managing people""; you've never done it before

But more importantly

Be humble, you don't actually believe yourself you are less than others; but you convince others that you are.

This is not lying. Nobody can prove how you truly feel about your new job or promotion

This allows you to slip through the cracks and be on top without people stomping on you.

Or the fact that my professor recently re-opened my midterm online for me because I missed the deadline.

So my question is: is it possible for social engineering to rub off? Am I doing it unintentionally? Am I even social engineering?

The first pointer is obvious: Your lies are very dependent on your audience.

Paired with the second pointer: Lying is very dependent on your improvisational skills or readiness. It is always best to prepare for any question that could arise from your lies. Since I am mediocre with improvising

However, and they are going to want answers. The most effective way is to be prepared.

However, it is not about selling that you actually did something. Lying is about distracting your audience from the holes in your story. 

I find the most effective way to distract your audience

Your best back-up brush off move is to feign discomfort discussing the topic. When your lie is negative

There is offensive lying (being prepared for questions posed by a positive lie) and defensive lying (always having an evasive maneuver prepared).

I am more honed in defensive lying

The best technique is to use body language, and do your job of distracting the conversation for you. If not, feigning discomfort atleast allows for time to formulate a response to their inquiries.

As a liar

Which brings me to my next point: Memory

Memory is the single most important factor to lying. If you cannot remember your lies

Dependent on the severity of the lie, ready to emerge when that one person decides to bring it up.

Insignificant lies can be trashed after a month. If anyone brings it up, after offensively questioning the integrity of *their* memory, feign defeat.

**Never don't know.** 

Not knowing is a signal that you are unsure of your claims

In absence of not knowing, remember to back it up with plausible confirmation. Allow your audience to make up your own fake story, and faintly remember something along the lines of that.

When you claim that you don't remember

Another defensive mechanism is to prove your integrity. Intentionally lead on that you are lying

The last pointer is: Lie to yourself. The best way to execute lying is to appear as if you are as comfortable with the lie as the truth. Lie to yourself on the outside

Have fun lying everyone. People are easy to manipulate for your benefit

Bribing your way into a restaurant, and this should be a *challenge*. I personally have gotten into several exclusive restaurants with these handicaps, so I know its possible.

The paper will be based on a social experiment I'm running. It's basically about trusted relationships and how social engineers manipulate them. Specifically in social media.

I put together this website.

www.theinternetistrue.com

The premise is basically that I've found we're more likely to trust unknown content coming from social media than we are from email. We're trained to not open suspicious documents and such in email because we know they might be viruses. We're quick

If this link was tied to a status update like:

""IRON MAN 4 PREVIEW LEAKED!"" - I'm sure someone would click on it - in this case it's safe but a bad guy could redirect you to something bad. Get it? 

We're more likely to just randomly click stuff based on the trust we have for social media because we apparently know the people posting. What if my account got hacked and the bad guy was posting AS me... there's no way for you to tell.

I'm trying to find a few companies / users who would spread this link on their Facebook pages as part of the experiment - you'd be mentioned in the talk and put on some kind of 'supporters' page if your company can contact me after posting - I'd love to get a screen grab of the post itself...",,t5_2qlud,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/1eed5j/social_media_a_little_birdie_told_me/

* I am almost incapable of looking someone in the eyes while talking to them. I can do it for brief periods (1-5 seconds), and I forget what I'm saying mid sentence.

* I can barely understand some people's speech. If someone has a heavy accent, usually), I'll suddenly understand what they said. Media is no exception to this.

Here are some of the things I found

To obtain a kindle, however amazon will sometimes send them to a replacement team (On suspicions), then ban the account.
Amazon caught on to this when they released the new Kindles, according a developer at one of these social engineering forums.

They would shipping claim companies and claim the item never came, as they often times never put a investigation unless it's a very high amount.

Heres what these people tend to abuse
-Cross Shipping (They would ship a empty box, they would already get the product)
-Advanced Replacement/Rma (Oftentimes, then abandon it, the company would not be able to get any money. Sometimes companies offer advanced replacements without even asking for a CC)
-Boxing (This is a standard rma/replacement, but they would use items such as dry ice, or ice, so the box would lose its weight, as if it got ""stolen"" in transit, and they would social engineer the company for a replacement) This is commonly used with apple. 
-Simple Complaining (This is done with Food, tell them you got sick etc. This one isn't really damaging)

Notable Attacks
-Amazon Kindles
-Sony TV's. Sony must've have a LOT of money for these, and a generated serial (Apparently they didn't even check the serials), and sony would ship replacements. Their was plenty of services on the forums for these, and it would be 50$ for 500$ tv's, or even tv's worth several thousand dollars. Was patched, I bet sony's insurance company was not happy.
-Logitech is generally being defrauded, which is exploited, as they generally do AR's without any CC. Sometimes they do not even ask for it back. Still done.
-Microsoft Xbox's took a big hit before, it was all over, it became very widespread and many people got a lot of xboxes. It eventually became patched by Microsoft.

*I have suggested negotiation training for the sales team.  In our experience, they quickly go back to business as usual.
*To counter that, we can strategize how to handle customer price objections.  And be able to come up with other areas that we could make concessions that don't have to do with price.
*There are also a few instances where we need to re-examine our price for certain products.

Any other ideas that we could try?

* Social engineering (political science)

* Social engineering (security)

* Trial Lawyers (http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/zf9lo/are_the_best_trial_lawyers_actually_great_social/)

* The Games People Play

He's betting that you will trust him because he's a redditor and reddit is full of good people. He's hoping that redditors will install his exploit extension without question.

1366853744.0,1d1wwf,Ever wondered what makes certain people tick?,Justryingtofocus,21,12,16,"Ok so this is my first time posting

Also this is going to be a ~~little~~ really fucking long

So recently I discovered the Myers Briggs personality typing system. Long story short, because this one goes a bit deeper.

The base of the system was created by Carl Jung. He said look niggas. There's only a couple different ways that humans perceive and process information. 8 different ways to be exact. You either perceive information by (S)ensing or i(N)tuition. And you judge that information by either (T)hinking or (F)eeling. That's only four? Well each function (that's what they're called) is either (i)ntroverted or (e)xtroverted. And to assure that most of this is based on hard science

Sorry about the random parentheses

Fast forward a couple of years. Meyers and Briggs put it all together and made personality profiles about it. 16 different ones. Basically, when you are most relaxed you will probably be using your dominant function). 

Functional Stack:
So each type has four functions that they use regularly, one intuitive function, and one thinking function. But don't forget the i's and e's. The order either goes ieie or eiei (if the first function is extroverted, the second is introverted, yadda yadda yadda).

Ok

I vs E

Introverted vs Extroverted. This is commonly mistaken as gaining energy from being around people (extroverted) vs gaining energy from being alone (introverted). While true as a very general rule

S vs N

Does the type prefer to perceive their information by Sensing or by iNtuition? Now above I said that each type has both. But one is preferred

T vs F

Thinking vs feeling

P vs J

Perceiving vs Judging, a perceiver will be more likely to be late to a meeting and a judger will be more likely to plan ahead and get there on time. If your type has an extroverted judging function (the dominant or ""higher up"" one) then you are a judger, and if your type has an introverted judging function then you are a perceiver.

Now let's look at the functions in a little more depth. And before we get started down the rabbit hole

Sensing: External sensors (Se) take the world in via their natural senses, and they also tend to get stuck in their ways as they get older. When you dig down and attempt to access how exactly you felt in a certain situation a long time ago, you are probably using Si.

Intuition: If sensing is being finely in tune with what exactly your body is feeding your brain then intuition is having your unconscious mind get first look- and then feeding you back select information based on that. So that's how it works, Ne (extroverted intuition) sees *what could be*. Ne dominant personalities see what things could be, and how to get them that way. An Ne abuser would look at a flawed system and immediately be generating ways to improve it. It is very broad, has little depth, and is quick. If someone you know is a very quick thinker, they might be an Ne user. Now Ni is a little bit different. Where Ne looks at something and expands upon it to find something better, Ni looks deeper, internalize the stick

Remember that Sensing and Intuition are both perceiving functions

Thinking: Te is all about organizing the external world in a way that makes logical ""sense"". It expands upon the horizon creating possibilities (if I do this, right answer is found. If two people wanted to go for ice cream, a Te user wouldn't give a shit where as long as ice cream was acquired, and a Ti user would determine exactly which type of ice cream was desired before setting out.

Feeling: Fe is an awesome function. It allows you to be naturally in tune with the emotions of others, although to varying degrees, hence the hyper emotional people and the cool-heads).

Now just for fun

I want to try again however. I know that the first person I talk to will say the thing that they did before (and there would be no use in arguing with him/her)

How should I 1) maneuver around the low-level employee and 2) get the higher-level employee to help me out? I can imagine different strategies for a man or a woman.

I think that this skill could help out a whole lot more that just convincing my university to consolidate my money.

My username is NexusXtremeOne

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas

I have no idea if this 'feature' is to be included in the full version.

The email could claim to be required for 'linking their ID to their new gmail account'. Doing this under the guise of additional security would only help your cause. Request a return email, in a specified format, that contains their name, ID number, and maybe some useless information to make everything ok. An assurance at the bottom of the page that 'this is an automated system and no individual will see this information' would seal the deal.

I have emailed the university about this weakness. We'll see if they take any action. 

Knowing someone's name is the first step in gaining more information. Another variation would be to email them a spoofed facebook page offering integration of the two services. Or if you're not so interested in account information

I don't know why, but I also didn't urge them to go faster, because that would have been rude, I *did* offer them some water though, and offered to carry their bags (yeah, I'm like that).

After that the girl told me I was such an opportunist and so horrible. She probably thought that I wanted to be the teachers pet. Maybe this is because most people in my grade aren't as mature to regard the teachers as an equal human being but rather as ""people who tell you to do stuff""

(1) Excellent public speaking skills. My voice sounds great on a microphone and boy can I gave an impassioned speech. I am regularly asked to speak on behalf of just about any organization that I am involved with, in front of the state capital next to the governor, some lady came up to me and told me something along the lines of ""You have probably been told this before, but you have the ability to connect with people on a deep emotional basis"". I didn't know what the fuck she meant by that so I just smiled and thanked her.... 

(2) Good at interviews. My god can I bullshit during an interview. One lady literally started weeping after I was done speaking about how passionate I was about her organization.....I really just wanted their lavish stipend lol

(3) Good at writing. I am a good academic writer. Not brilliant, but being a black male and a little intelligent seems to make me seem x10 more intelligent to some people. This is especially true for 50+ liberals. 

And that's about all. Any suggestions? Especially for possible careers lol.

Source video [here](http://youtu.be/NcspFO7o7Js).

This con is great, and don't want to pay for it. He promises no passwords, no surveys, no downloads and gives simple step by step instructions.

The lie is simple and believable, why wouldn't they? It seems so simple. 

What he asks them to do is to start a new account with the link he gives you, you gain ADMIN status and full access to yadda yadda yadda. 

The brilliance is mind blowing. You click the link, once you get to level 10, nothing happens. 

As long as you get to level 5 (both are relatively easy to do) he will be happy. You see, you get XP boosts (or something, I don't play League of Legends often.)

That's what makes this so great. He probably put 15 minutes of work into this

This shows the importance (for pen-testers in this sub) in CHOOSING YOUR TARGET. This guy has it figured out. Hell, to be honest. But its a great example of Social engineering, and nobody comes out harmed (no money lost, no physical harm, but some time wasted).

It also shows use of several of the [7 basic cons, it could be better.

For example, and not full of past marks). He really ought to have used the Time Principle and created a sense of urgency, something along the lines of the link is only good for a week, and just delete and repost the video or something. This is just speculation on my part, but I am sure that he'd have thousands instead of hundreds and honestly, since he's put this much work into it at this point, why not put in the extra effort? Also, but if he doesn't have targeted ads on these pages
