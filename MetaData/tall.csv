I'm at work, they start talking shit about some tall chick they know, which devolves into talking shit about tall women in general.. how they are 'goofy looking' their feet are too big, its not normal, etc etc. They go on for about 4 or 5 minutes, during which i'm slowly inching closer and closer to them until i'm looming directly over their heads.
The embarassment in their eyes when they noticed me was priceless. But it didn't end there... i followed them from the bagel line, to the elevator. Silently looming the entire time.

Wait

In disbelief I asked her again how much it would cost and received the same answer... this is how the conversation progressed from then on...

Me: That isn't what you have advertised in your leaflets here on reception

Receptionist: Yes

Me: My legs are only a few inches longer than my friend who comes here and she pays the normal price.

Receptionist: I'm sorry but we have to charge extra because you're very tall.

I was getting very angry at this point.

Me: Oh so that woman who was just here didn't use ANY extra wax or strips than the normal person?!

Receptionist: We don't discriminate people based on their weight.

WHAT. THE. FUCK.  I left that store right there and then. I was livid.

We're tall

I've been unemployed for 2 months now (first time in 14 years, I'm constantly berated and told I'm worthless for not having work, even though I'm actively seeking employment daily, I don't drink nor do I partake in drugs (that includes you, /r/trees). 

Two years ago I lost everything I owned. I made some poor decisions and I blame no one else. Unfortunately

Anyway, resume drop-offs etc, I was growing incredibly discouraged. And we're not talking picky here, we're talking fucking Dishwasing jobs, General Labor, Office Admin, Customer Service, Technical Support

Finally, the interviewer had said to come in tomorrow (which is today) and they would have docs drawn to offer me the position. I was extremely happy.

She ended the conversation by saying

Why you might ask? As previously stated

Not to be deterred, but I couldn't find anyone with shoes, nor could I afford them (I wear a size 18, cheapest I could find is $80 at Nordstroms Rack). 

So I polish my cleanest black sneakers

So, not sure what to expect. I walk in the door, a rather short man, dapper as fuck, inquires if I'm so-and-so, etc. We verify, and shake hands. He leads me to the office to sign

He takes one look at my shoes, and through correspondence here I can see this was relayed to you. ""

I nod.

He continues

Before I was even able to explain how difficult it is to find clothing at a price that's affordable while still attempting to eat

Needless to say

I expect nothing

Thank you reddit.

In 2001 I was touring the Dingle ring and had stopped for lunch and a beer.  When I came out of the pub there was a tour bus full of Japanese tourists walking through the town with an Irish tour guide. They saw me and stared for a little bit. Just as I was wondering what was going on the tour guide came up and asked me if I wanted to make some money.  It turns out that the tour group wanted pictures with ""a real Irish giant"" and would pay me to be in a slew of pictures with all of them.  I  explained I was American but he just laughed...  ""They don't know that! Just smile a lot and we'll have some fun.""  

So for the next 40 minutes I had my picture taken with my arms around little Japanese women, and a few other poses. They also paid me 40 pounds for my time.  So somewhere in Japan is an entire group of people who were thrilled that they met a ""real Irish giant"" and in all the pictures it's my grinning face staring out at them.

TL;DR - Was paid to take pictures with a Japanese tour group in Ireland for being a ""real Irish giant"".

Edit:  So my wife just made me feel old.  I reminded her of this and she said ""Wait... didn't that happen back in 2001?  Honey that was over a decade ago.  You're old now.""

Let me post everything I know up to this point for anyone that is in the same predicament and I'd really appreciate your hidden gems that you've come across. 

Let me add that finding cool clothes has taken a LOT of time and iterations. I have often wondered what would happen if my closet went up in flames and I suddenly had to rebuy all of these things that took me so long to acquire. Finding tall clothes is riddled with letdowns

The key is to find a brand you like (Ralph Lauren for me) and then just stick with it. The sizes/fits will be more consistent.

I wear a Large Tall shirt/jacket

After standing up and looking around I didn't see any frantic looking woman racing through the crowd so I knelt back down and asked James if he needed some help.  He promptly jumped forward and latched himself around my neck.  I was a little startled but stood up slowly with him clinging like a limpet.  I told him that the best part of being tall was being a lot like being a giraffe

In the meantime my wife came out of the store and gave me the ""what's going on?"" look.  I introduced her to James and told her that we were going to stay here in front of the store while she went to the nearest security kiosk and asked for help finding James's mom.  I told her ""We'll be fine... I'll just stay here being a giraffe for James."" which made James laugh a little.  About 10 minutes later this woman with a security guard in tow came barrelling through the crowd and James leapt onto her when she got within about a foot of us.  Much crying ensued and I got many cheek kisses and hugs from grateful Mom.  

Merry Christmas James... I'm glad you found your Mom and I hope she doesn't carry through on her threat to physically tie you to her for the next 1000 yea",,t5_2qv8g,1355423483.0,,blue,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/14r0vb/christmas_in_the_mall_how_i_became_a_lost_little/

The feeling of being Huge!  I know I am a healthy weight for my height and proportionate, but am thin and yet I wear atleast a size 10 which in our culture to many is considered plus-sized.  It's hard to keep a good perspective when many young tall woman don't have anyone else to feel ""normal"" around.  I'm sure there are also many women who can see through all the bull-shit and realize that they are beautiful and don't get bogged down by super-models, peers and the media who try to define the perfect woman.  I was not one of those woman when I was younger and am still recovering from it.  

When I grew to my current height in High School and had no idea what to do with it.  No boys would date me

Luckily when I got out of High School I realized that plenty of people loved my height and that those who didn't weren't that great themselves.  I slowly eased up on myself and didn't try to control everything that goes in my mouth.  Now I just try to be healthy and that makes me feel good about myself.  Once and awhile still I stand next to someone half my size and I get my old anxieties and inscurities and wish I could shrink down.  The funny part is that I look at other people and I see beauty in everyone


I guess I wrote all of this
