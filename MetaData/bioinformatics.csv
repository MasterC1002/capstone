We present a pairwise local aligner

algorithm identiﬁes homologous subsequences by considering all evolutionary histories. It has higher maximum sensitivity than Viterbi
extensions,
describing strongly similar and weakly similar regions of homologous DNA. Training parameters using two sub-models produces
superior alignments
with our new parameter set achieves sensitivity 0.59 on synthetic tests. In contrast
0.35 with the same false positive rate. Using the weak sub-model as parameters for LASTZ increases its sensitivity to 0.59 with high

I'll try to keep it short

I'm a 30 yr old developer (not sure if age is relevant for this), TT, ...
The fact that I got a MSc in Computer Science allowed me to get a job offer at one of the main institutions around for genome

Now, my current employers are offering a 23% pay rise, which makes the difference in salaries a bit significant.

I'm not sure what my actual job would be other than creating scripts that would serve as pipeline for processing the raw data from sequencing.

I have a natural inclination for biology  and the purpose of this role seems great
will I feel frustrated dealing with code where my experience will not be relevant at all?

I’ve been lucky enough to score two jobs upon graduating from my MSc in bioinformatics. I’m working both concurrently on a part-time basis as a research assistant.

I would certainly learn more biology with job A and pick up some wet lab techniques, master of none’. I don’t overly enjoy the wet lab work, but I do really like the variety and being able to break my day up from coding/staring at a screen. Job B on the other hand involves work on some very exciting and top tier purely computational work. The project I’m working on for job B has more interesting biological questions, but I enjoy both projects.

Generally, but permanent research positions are very hard to get so I need a fall-back. Job A has some nice perks, better pay and a nicer/more social environment which can be pretty important for day-to-day sanity and balance.

In theirs scripts they used newbler to convert the sff files to FASTA (one file of reads for each individual). They then aligned the reads to a reference file using BLAST and basically constructed their own alignment file using straight perl. I need to start doing some analysis on this file (coverage

The test data is for [GSE8607 out of the GEO database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8607) it has been normalized to be properly accepted by the GALGO and PAMR libraries but other than that it's unaltered.


================================ GALGO ================================


All results here are for 3000 chromosomes (variables) with 5 genes each and the fitness goal is of .9


========================= 


This first image: http://i.imgur.com/hMsFQ.png depicts the summary of the characteristics of the chromosome population in the course of one evolutionary event. 


The first graph (Gene Frequency) hast a ""Gene Index"" in X (I'm unsure of what that means) and the Frequency in which the genes appeared in Y. It depicts the 7 most frequent genes with their respective names on top of the bar. 


The second graph (Gene Rank Stability) has Rank + Frequency in Y (I'm unsure what ""Rank"" is) and Genes on X. From there we can see the most stable genes which are the darkest ones (left side).


The third graph (Last Generation) is a complete mystery to me to be honest.


========================= 


The second image: http://i.imgur.com/M68CB.png depicts the population summary for that number of test (in this case the test 3000).


The first graph (Population) is a mystery except that I've managed to learn that the tiny blue x you can see close to where the overlapping of results occur means that that's a fit candidate.


The second graph (Fitness History) gives us 2 dotted lines, however since it's not the desired fitness we would require to either add more variables OR reduce the fitness goal (which isn't something desirable).


The third graph (Max-Chromosomes) has in X Genes and in Y the Generation but other than that I'm at a loss.


========================= 


The third image http://i.imgur.com/jvTdO.png depicts the overall fitness of the test the blue line is the mean of all the chromosomes and we can see that on the 12th generation the 90% fitness level was achieved while this seems contradictive with the past graph that's because the past graph was focusing on the latest test and this is the average.


========================= 


The fourth image http://i.imgur.com/W0qgq.png shows the confusion matrix in which we can see that the sensitivity (probability of obtaining a negative result when it's not present) is of .72 for Etapa 1 (E1) and .71 for Etapa 4 (E4) the specificity (probability of obtaining a positive when it's not there) os the opposite for both. Now in HERE we can see that the fitness level of .9 is not achieved and this may be a result of the fact that the fitness takes a training set and then cross-validates while this test uses all of the available data possibly skewing the results. Other than that


=========================


The next image http://i.imgur.com/fJ8x3.png shows the same confusion matrix but filtered with the solutions only which is why it dropped 4 models. Since there's really not much variation we can safely assume these aren't relevant for the results.


=========================


The next one http://i.imgur.com/j6Q2B.png shows again the confusion matrix filtered by solutions but picking only the best chromosome which gives us a much better separation between E4 and E1.


=========================


This one http://i.imgur.com/K0t3i.png is a heatmap built with the best chromosomes of the set


=========================


In here: http://i.imgur.com/YGICE.png we can see a heatmap built with the list of genes from the forward selection model (the image is further in this thread) and we can still see the uniformity of color specially differentiating a red color from the top-left to the down-right corners.


=========================


These: http://i.imgur.com/kINpG.png are the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) of the best 2 genes according to the forward selection model as far as I can tell


=========================


In this image: http://i.imgur.com/gdKvJ.png we see the forward selection model


================================ PAMR ================================


After doing the training and cross-validating of the data with the PAMR library this is the plot of the cross-validation http://i.imgur.com/PlBZd.png in here we can see in the first graph that the misclassification error is always close to .4 but other than that I'm not sure what information I can gather from that graph.


The second graph though shows the difference in the misclassification error between E1 and E4 and it increases dramatically for E4 when we start using less and less genes while it decreases for E1. Since this technique uses the [Shrunken Centroid Classification](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/Rdist/howwork.html) method I think it's best to get an impartial threshold value (I might be wrong) and thus 1.7 was selected.


Because 1.7 was selected the following graph: http://i.imgur.com/DKeAJ.png (which happens to be the confusion matrix) shows that E4 has more variation when using the shrunken centroid but I don't know what else I can take from there.


Following these are 2 results the first is the Error rate http://i.imgur.com/vvtND.png and then the Cross-validation of the gene probabilities: http://i.imgur.com/7otgM.png I can't figure these graphs out.

I am a 36 year old mother of three. I have a B.S. in biology from a good school.  I have been working for the past 13 years as a software developer/sharepoint administrator/SQL administrator and developer/IT Jane of all trades.  
  
My first love remains biology, Biology. I don't think I'm interested in a PhD. This is all complicated by the fact that I have three small children, and a husband whose business can't relocate from our small resort town in Colorado.  

My questions are:  
* Are the MS degrees available in Bioinformatics that offer online learning?  
* Are there good Bioinformatics MS programs in Colorado?  
* Are there career options in bioinformatics without an advanced degree?  
* If so
* Any advice for someone in my situation who has been out of school for a long time?      

Any comments or responses are greatly appreciated.

We're a small lab out of the University of Victoria on Vancouver Island in Canada. Our interests mostly lie in viral bioinformatics, is written in Java to allow easy cross-platform use, and so that it always remains up-to-date. The core program is a few years old, but we're in the process of adding new analytical features to it and striving to make it better. It's absolutely free to use (you just have to register on our site) and if there are any suggestions of neat things to make it more awesome, we'd love to hear them! 

Base-by-Base (BBB) allows you to directly edit your alignment by manually altering misaligned gaps, ORFS, and reading frames. The program can be used with both protein and nucleotide sequences, and accepts a wide range of input files.

The program can be accessed [here](http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/virology-ca-tools/base-by-base/). Feel free to check out some of the [other tools we've been working on](http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/virology-ca-tools/) too!

2.  What are the options of instruments?  My understanding is they come in two flavors - HPLC-MS and shotgun style.  The former passes the sample through a column first to achieve some separation to make a better prediction about the lipid's size whereas the latter does not do this because ultimately we can predict the size from the machine's output anyway?

I am taking an intro to bioinformatics and noticed the redundancies in the codons that map to an amino acid.  For instance, UCG, and UCC all map to Serine.  The pattern of the first two base pairs being the same for an amino acid seems to hold for many amino acids.  Is there some sort of biological reason why there are these redundancies?  Is the transcription or translation process more likely to ""corrupt"" the last base pair?

I keep thinking about hamming distances (maybe that is not the best approach to this, a biological process) and how the way these are mapped would not be the most practical for providing the best error correction.  Though this is assuming that each of the base pairs are equally likely to be corrupted, which my intuition is telling me is wrong.  The fact that DNA has evolved to have some sort of error correction is quite amazing in my eyes.

I'm a Canadian student living in Ottawa (hopefully someone here is from Ottawa). I have a bachelor's in Biology and Computer Science and I am planning on applying to a graduate program. I am not sure whether I should do a master's in computer science alone or computer science with a specialization in bioinformatics. 

I just wanted to ask you guys if there is a demand for bioinformatitians. The main reason I would like to do computer science alone is that there is a high demand for it in Canada and it is constantly growing. However

My other concern is salary. I know that it's not all about the money but if I can make more working as a software engineer for example I would rather go that route. I'm sorry if this seems rude but what are the average salaries for a bioinformatitians?

My question is:

If I don't get accepted into MSTP, but I (perhaps strangely) would rather be considered for secondary admission to regular graduate school. As I said above, my primary interest is research, but with a MD I could be more involved in seeing that research turn into clinical results.

My questions:

1. Should I even be considering MSTP? I know they're very competitive.
2. Do I still take the GRE?

I'm currently implementing an algorithm for calculating the likelihood of a
given phylogenetic tree. I'm reading chapter 16 in Joseph Felsenstein's
*Inferring Phylogenies* which explains this rather nicely
one thing and would like to hear if you can help me.

Given the following tree

             x|
              /\
             /  \
            /    \

        /\      t3/  \
     t1/  \t2    / t4/\t5
      /    \    /   /  \
     A      C  C   C    G

and an assumption that evolution in different lineages is independent

P(*A,C,G,x,y,z,w*|*T*) = P(x)×P(y|x,t1)×…×P(G|w

i.e. each probability is only dependent on what's above it and the branch
length. Ok

&gt; **The probability of *x* may be taken to be the probability that
&gt; point on an evolving lineage, G,* or
&gt; *T*).** If we are allowed to assume that evolution has been proceeding for a
&gt; very long time according to the particular model of base substitution that we
&gt; are using
&gt; of base *x* under that model. The other probabilities are derived from the
&gt; model of base substitution.

What I really don't understand is the text I highlighted in bold. (The rest was
included for context.) Why does he suddenly talk about “a random point on an
evolving lineage” when the text is talking about the tree shown above? Am I
simply reading to much into his formulation or have I missed anything?

TL;DR: Why does Felsenstein talk about *x* at a “random point”?

I am completing my MSc. Bioinformatics in northern Europe, I submitted a grant application to a national foundation.  The grant application was for the first full year of PhD work.  I got news recently that they had awarded me a grant for the first 6 months of work.  Professor A has since earned some group grant money and could continue paying me after the grant money period.  Woohoo!

However

My current line of thinking is that it would be good to take the 6 month national grant, while searching for PhD positions using a CV that now includes more publications and the fact that I have won a grant.

I have never been in this situation before or very long in academics at this level.  Would this be burning any bridges with Professor A?  Is it common that people actively look for better PhD positions while having an offer on the table at the university where they are currently pursuing the MSc?

My question comes from a thought raised by someone else on this subreddit as well as a friend. Living in the most isolated capital city in the world (Perth


**Bachelor of Science**

* University of Western Australia; no Bioinformatics course; two majors required (thus Computer Science and Genetics)
* Just down the road from where I live; still see friends etc.; no moving/living costs; UWA (from memory) is very good with genetics research
* Not specific; UWA's Computer Science is apparently 'questionable'; WA certainly not a bioinformatics 'hotspot' (apparently Melbourne is)


**Bioinformatics**

* University of New South Wales (other side of Australia)
* Specific course; UNSW has the National Computer Science School; closer to potential employers
* Have to move


I'm sure that was suitably vague. The issue others have raised is whether or not doing the Bioinformatics course is too specific. So would I be better to not (entirely) specialise and save myself a bunch of troubles (moving etc.) doing Computer Science + Genetics at UWA or specialise early near the jobs and so on at UNSW?

I am trying to identify the conserved portions of a protein degredation domain which is covalently attached to proteins via tmRNA. The tag is encoded by normal RNA-&gt;AA rules in the tmRNA and I have been able to identify the tag sequence in most of the 65 sequenced genomes of the phylum of interest.

My main difficulty is how to interpret this data to conclude which positions in the protein tag are the most highly conserved. My first inclination would be to simply find the distibution of amino acids at each position in the tag with reference to the stop codon at the end of the tag. I see two major faults in this method though.

1. It does not account for insertions/deletions which can shift sequences which still would remain conserved but would not be identified as such with the above method.

2. It is biased towards the motifs of organisms which have had multiple different strains sequenced.

So my question is how to identify conserved elements within a motif? Is the a standard method or program which is used?

My only current thought of an improvement is to address point 2 by weighting the sequences by how phylogenetically dissimiliar they are to the others.

**EDIT:** The sequences are hypervariable immunoglobluin sequences. I am looking at the complementary determining region and seeing if there is a preference for a nucleotide bias during an infection. A paper has shown that these neutralizing Igs bind to the virus with greater affinity after some time the patient has been infected with said virus.

What my lab is trying to prove is that it is the change in nucleotide sequence towards a certain bias mimics the mutation bias of the virus. According to the mutation data I have

4.  Purchase a MacPro and use it as a dedicated computer for alignment and analysis.
5.  Purchase an IBM x-series server and use it for the same purpose (using a Linux distro).
6.  Construct a small in-lab cluster.
Most of our current computers are Apple, especially since most of the analysis we do is based on Python scripts.

I'm just a humble biology postdoc, but find myself doing all my own bioinformatics these days and wouldn't have in any other way.  What I need to do is to be able to manipulate data files such as FASTA genome sequences (and maybe FASTQs as well), VCF reports, etc.  Ideally I'd love to be able to write a little program that could, the 200 basepairs flanking the SNP

R is usually my go-to program for data manipulation and I do most of my scripting just in UNIX, and some C (but just the basics).  I know what loops are and if/else structures, etc., but I really don't have much experience.  In other words, I am basically naive but primed to learn quickly.

Any advice on what scripting language to learn to do all this?  Can is just be done in R?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

So I started looking for bioinformatics jobs and pretty much everything I saw required a PhD. So now I'm thinking of going back to grad school and get a Master's in bioinformatics (I don't want to commit to 5-6 years of a PhD

My question is what program exactly am I supposed to look for in grad school? I'm looking mainly at Canadian universities, that would be appreciated too.

The proteins need to be anchored to the inside of the cell membrane, then with t19 and the second domain

Here's where things start to get weird: using the [TMHMM Server](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) utility, there is also a small bump around amino acid 80, but it is very low in probability. The strange thing is that when looking at the complete sequence of my protein this bump is now close to 100% probability. Even weirder, If I take the complete sequence and chop off progressively larger chunks from the C terminus until I eventually get back to t19 only, I can see the height of this peak drop smoothly until it is back at its original value. So it seems like, according to the algorithm at least, the rest of the protein is somehow making the area around amino acid 80 more likely to be a transmembrane region.

i just started my PhD thesis and was wondering if anybody here had some advice for me.
I'm a computer scientist. My Master thesis project was to create a framework to align NGS data, so that people with no CS background can use it. I was able to do this quite well, it concluded in a software i'm still maintaining that is used in at least 2 laboratories. I touched every step of the NGS diagnostics process.  Raw data filtering, Raw data statistics generation, Alignment, Variant detection, Coverage analysis, integration with online resources like ensembl etc etc. I'm no expert in any domain

Now for my PhD. The general idea is to bring the NGS analysis software to the cloud or distribute to workload on a grid.
My problem is, it seems like there is nothing new i can add there. Same thing goes for GPU aided alignment. It has been done, and it seems to work. Simply adapting one of those solutions and making it very userfriendly so that it intergrates into what i have already done is not enough for a PhD.

But I've realized that I don't particularly enjoy this too much, and that got me thinking about what I do like. I remember that in university I enjoyed some of my bio courses, I enjoyed some CS courses, but all the Bioinformatics courses were always the most interesting and fun to me. Which made me realize that maybe I should follow that route instead of the pure CS route.
So I started looking for bioinformatics jobs and pretty much everything I saw required a PhD. So now I'm thinking of going back to grad school and get a Master's in bioinformatics (I don't want to commit to 5-6 years of a PhD

Creating a gene list ranked by signal-to-noise ratio with the ""GSEA.GeneRanking"" function was simple enough

* input the ranked list (presumably the one created from the GeneRanking function?) into the EnrichmentScore (ES) function in the correct format.
*  input my gene sets into the ES function (i.e. how to create an object that defines a gene set)

I'm sure these are relatively simple questions
