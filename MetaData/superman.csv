1371807306.0,1gsb4n,Aquaman was there in Man of Steel,le_me,244,31,101,"So here is something that I have been thinking about. This can set up a perfect tie-in with Aquaman.

Aquaman was there in Man of Steel and there are some pretty good instances that actually point to it:



**Why did the oil rig blow up?**

This has been mentioned before - **The name of the drilling company was Merrevale Oil

It was Aquaman who sabotaged that rig. I like to think that Aquaman has had it with the continued pollution of the oceans and has started taking a stand.

The sequel movie could show some naval intelligence picked up by a Wayne Tech Satellite that describes an incredibly fast moving and compact ""bogey"" under water.




**The Whales?**

Why were whales hanging around the blown up oil rig? They were doing whale calls (signalling to Aquaman?).

Superman was floating in the water and the whales were at a distance... the scene cuts after that and Superman is shown stealing clothes.

I say the whales made sure that Superman was alright and ""washed up ashore"" before gaining consciousness and hence not interfere with Aquaman's plans.




**After defeating the world engine**

The world engine lands in the Indian Ocean (practically Aquaman's backyard). After it has been destroyed... Superman is again found conveniently lying on a beach and soaking in that sweet sweet solar juice.

I think that he was carried there by Aquaman or some of his dolphins.


I know .. it feels like I am grasping at straws.. but it makes too much sense. What do you guys think?",self,t5_2qrwe,1371811342.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gsb4n/aquaman_was_there_in_man_of_steel/

1372724811.0,1hgp83,The Superman Movie We Needed (or Why I Loved MoS),WilliamMcCarty,151,19,83,"I'm 36 years old.  I've been a Superman fan as long as I can remember.  This is lengthy and not for everybody so feel free to quit reading now or at any point hereafter.  

I had issues with nearly every aspect of the movie before
 it was released.  The suit
 it).  Everything.  But every concern I had was wiped away soon as I
 saw it.

 Krypton was cold and calculating
 which I loved
 humankind that it wasn’t an ideal for Superman to strive toward
 as a warning of something to avoid.  Jor El says that Superman can
 serve as an example to the people of Earth but I don’t believe its in
 the way that people think
 genetically perfect being but rather
 Kent raised him.  Someone who does the right thing because it’s the
 right thing to do.  Not for glory or justice or honor or vengeance.
 But just because he can and therefore should.  There’s a line
 somewhere
 he can fly.  He’s Superman because a good couple from Kansas loved
 their son.”  HE could just as easily have been a bad man and a
 conqueror of worlds with all his power but he’s a good man because he
 was raised to be good.  It’s the opposite of what Krypton is.  You can
 only be what they decide you’re to be.  What if a child dreamt of
 something more?

 The cast.  I wouldn’t have picked a single one of these people to be
 in this movie.  And that’s all right.  They were perfect.  Henry
 Cavill? Sure, Superman.
 He looked the part.  He was tall,  he looked like
 freaking Superman!  And he played the part just right.  Strong and
 forceful with just a hint of uncertainty
 would be like.  He had it down perfectly.  Much the way Christian Bale
 I never would have imagined as Batman/Bruce Wayne he was the perfect
 person for the role.  Henry Cavill embodied the character of Superman
 and Clark Kent perfectly.  He is Superman for me now
 every other person to ever wear the cape.

 As does Amy Adams for Lois.  Tough as nails
 get what she wants Lois.  The Lois from the books.  Red hair?  I
 didn’t see it.  But honestly
 better?  Make her a redhead!  Again
 it was perfect.  She inserted herself into situations and dangerous
 elements
 character is in the books.  I always think of a line from the books
 where she says one of her main attractions to Superman is that she
 finally found a man who could keep up with her.  This is the Lois we
 need and expect

 Other cast—Laurence Fishburne as Perry White.  I was annoyed
  Yes
 appeared on screen.  He was more polished than the Perry White I’m
 used to or expected.  But that’s ok.  His attitude was Perry all the
 way.  Forceful, loud behemoth of a man who respects
 his reporters but puts them in their place.  That’s Perry.  He owned
 it.  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane? Again
 they were perfect in those roles.   Replacing Jimmy Olsen with Jenny?
 If they ever tried something like this in the books I’d be livid but
 in a movie?  The character is barely more than a glorified extra.  It
 wasn’t all that big a deal.  Besides
 and Perry …could you really see that working with a frecklefaced
 redheaded little dude?  Nah

 Zack Snyder.  The man can’t coax a performance out of an actor to save
 his life.  He’s not a great director that way.  He is great at making
 things look awesome.  And he did.  The movie looked brilliant.  And
 his heavyhanded directing style was severely toned down for this
 movie
 a cast of real actors who know they craft and didn’t need a director
 to hold their hand and walk them through every scene.  He sat behind
 the camera
 perfect.

 The suit.  I was horrified when I saw it.  How does Ma Kent make that
 thing?  Why does it look like scuba gear?  At least there’s no red
 undies.  It didn’t look good to me.  I liked elements of it but as a
 whole?  Ugh.  Then I saw it onscreen.  Watching it sitting in a glass
 case or in a still photo was one thing but seeing it on a living
 breathing
 the story for the suit was more than acceptable by me.  Kryptonian
 garb.  Ma Kent didn’t make it.  Ok

 The story itself.  What I wanted when they were making this movie was
 what I got with Batman Begins.  That movie was essentially the comics
 put on screen.  I wanted that so badly for Superman.  That was not
 what we got.  We got something different.  It was a really completely
 different origin story but had some many elements of the books that it
 both familiar and new at the same time.  The deviations in canon from
 the books were forgivable to me because they were still rooted in the
 comic lore and worked so well on screen.  For example
 Byrne’s Krypton was a sterile environment but this Krypton was a live
 and biological world.  Though
 grown in test tubes essentially
 droids Kelex and Kelor both appeared in the movie and books
 remarkable similar to their appearances in the books.  Later
 Kryptonain scout ship there’s images of Kryptonians that remarkably
 resemble the statues scene in the books in Superman’s Fortress of
 Solitude though they aren’t statues in the movie.  I recognized them
 immediately.

 One of my main problems with Zod or any other Kryptonian coming to
 earth as a full grown adult would be that they would be overwhelmed by
 their newfound senses
 happened in the movie.  It was a genius bit of writing and it made me
 feel the realistic
 taking.

 The pace bothered some but I thought it was broken up well.  We didn’t
 have to sit through a lengthy backstory and tedious growing pains to
 get to an adult Clark doing superhero stuff.  The growing pains and
 backstory comes in flashbacks that punctuate events in his adult life.
  Some people complained that the movie didn’t really have enough story
 but it clocked in at nearly two a half hours.  During which time we
 saw Krypton live and die
 meet Lois, visit an
 alien spacecraft and oh yeah
 going on in that movie.  There was plenty of story there.  If they
 crammed in more dialogue or other scenes there would have been
 complaints that it was too long and things could have been cut.  Far
 as I’m concerned the pacing was fine and the lack of story complaints
 are utter bull.

 People said it was too dark and there was no humor.  I don’t believe
 it was too dark.  When you think about it
 been a rather dark one.  Orphaned
 raised by a kind couple who do their best but he’s still an outsider
 who struggles with who and what he is
 length for his whole life. That’s kind of depressing when you think
 about it.  About time we actually saw that side of his character
 expressed.  But no humor?  I grinned a fair bit during that movie.

 “Well

 “I think he’s kinda hot.”

 Clark: “I’m the one they’re looking for.”  Priest:  gulp.

 Lois:  “They say it’s all downhill after the first kiss.”  Superman:
 “I think it only counts if you’re kissing a human.”

 Superman: “You’re trying to find where I hang my cape.  You won’t.”

 And some scenes by themselves.  Superman’s dramatic take to the skies
 supposes to be shooting up into the skies
 heavens and…he hops.  Then comes the flight and…no
 ass.  I thought that was kind of funny
 intended that way but it made me chuckle.

 People complain about the action.  Too much?  Too much action in a
 Superman movie?  Really?  What would you have in a Superman movie besides 
 action?  He’s Superman!  He’s supposed to be in action!  He flies for
 god’s sake!  He soars through space and battles alien invaders and
 saves the world.  He does that on a fairly routine basis on the books
 no reason he shouldn’t do it on screen
 the action was dizzying and maybe you’re right but I’d say “Not it a
 bad way.”  Explosions
 supervillian throwing down in the skies and streets
 stuff of the comics on screen
 amazing and breathtaking and made me want to jump out of my seat and
 throw punches at the screen when Superman landed hit after hit into
 Zod and sends him tumbling through the skies.  It was big
 adventurous
 something incredible happened onscreen.

 And the end.  People complain about the end.  What exactly would you
 have him do?  Let Zod carry on fighting
 Zod said it himself
 Zod proclaimed himself a warrior
 Krypton and his people and they are all gone.  He had nothing to live
 for anymore.  His only recourse was total annihilation of everything
 around him and he has the capability and the will to do it.  Superman
 was not reckless.  During the battle with Zod he takes every
 opportunity to take to the skies
 from buildings and people but it’s Zod who keeps bringing it back into
 the populated areas.  Even in the battle at Smallville Superman is
 aware that lives are at stake and urges people to get to safety.  The
 only time we see him act in any way reckless is when he first attacks
 Zod and ponds him mercilessly
 grain silo.  But if you think about it
 mother and who amongst us wouldn’t wail on someone attacking our
 mother?  And two
 out in anger.  He’s never hit anyone in his life until this moment.
 He did so in defense of his family.  Sudden aggression and the
 reckless behavior that can come with that is understandable.  But back
 in Metropolis
 well aware of what he’s doing with Zod and what’s happening around
 him.  He’s faced with an impossible choice.  In the books
 alien invasions and superpowered beings are the norm.  They have
 prisons to hold these people and ways to nullify their abilities.  Not
 so in the world of this Superman in the movie.  This is our world and
 no such methods to contain the likes of Zod exist.  Remember
 that in the books
 stood before him and exposed Zod to the radioactive rock and watched
 him grow weaker
 slow,
 excruciating death than what occurred onscreen.  Superman snapped
 Zod’s neck in a last ditch effort to save people.  To prevent death.
 In the books
 would have done so again.  Just like Zod in the movie
 unstoppable force of destruction and the only way to prevent it was to
 end him.  Simply because Superman killed does not make him a bad
 person.  Jor El killed people in this movie.  Lois killed people.
 They are not evil or cruel or heartless.  They killed in defense of
 their families or themselves.  Superman killed in order to save the world
 lives of seven billion people
 again
 should be forced to cross.  And he doesn’t do so without regret or
 remorse
 He suffers for what he had to do.

 I think we can all say there’s things we would have liked to seen or
 things we would have wanted differently.  But in the end
 comes down to “That’s not how I would have done it” and it’s simply
 not fair to judge the movie that way.  Did it entertain us?  Did it
 give us a good story with big action and Superman saving the world in
 the most grand
 Even I’ll admit it’s not the Superman movie I wanted.  But that is in
 no way whatsoever a bad thing.  As the song says
 what you want but sometimes you get what you need.  This was the
 Superman movie we needed.  A huge
 stake epic with heart and soul.  Finally
 what Superman could really be capable of
 how he really is.

 No matter what happens next—if the sequels suck or the Justice League
 butchers the character and the studio goes all to hell with it—we can
 take this movie

I made the mistake of reading many (spoiler-free) reviews. I read both good and I read bad. I thought beforehand that I appreciated the ""bad"" reviews because they lowered by expectations

I found that throughout the movie the negative reviews starting nagging at me. As an avid fan I don't know if I was able to enjoy the movie as much because I started to catch the things that the negative reviewers were saying.

At the end of the movie, rushed story, etc. Even though I enjoyed it, I felt like since I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have, that I was cheated.

On the drive home from the theater - I began to analyze it more fully. I came to my senses. I started to feel that the movie really was well paced. It told just enough story. It developed the important characters VERY well (Superman, Zod, Pa Kent, etc). The other characters that weren't so well developed (Perry White, Jenny ""Olsen"", etc) I found I didn't care for anyway. I realized with the flying scenes, the action, the heat vision

The more I thought about it - the more I thought those things that are currently getting this movie low scores are just trivial and pointless. Sure there may be some plot holes. I can't think of any specifically...but were they big enough to ruin the movie? Of course not!

Overall

To those of you who haven't seen it, take a little while and analyze the movie for what it is. Try to decide if those things that bugged you were really that important...and then maybe you'll come to the conclusion like I did and realize this movie really is incredible!

Reflects J. Michael Straczynski's take on Superman. You can't pierce his skin, in the entire movie you knew Superman would not get hurt just like in that scene. Instead, you worried about how Superman would react to situations where he's emotionally invested.

I only saw the movie once and plan to see it again. Overall I was impressed by the quality and action. It was very fast paced so I do hope there's a 3.5 hour director cut in the making to flesh out the supporting characters. 

Oddly enough Michael Shannon's performance disappointed me the most. Part of it was I was impressed with the ads featuring him. However, he had to play the part of the ultimate bully that Clark truly had to make his toughest decision.

PS: Fuck Rotten Tomatoes in this case.

It happens literally every time Superman gets into a fight with another superhuman. Zack Snyder was on the ball with the combat. It was lengthy, superhuman, and everything any comic fan would want it to be.

And it's not like Superman wanted all that destruction

I've heard a lot of options for overcoming this:

* Red Sun Radiation- Superman is struck by red sun radiation in the opening of the game. He loses his powers and gains more and more powers with every mission. 

* Superman is a rookie- Clark Kent is a powerful alien from another planet but has not truly learned to harness his powers. He will gain abilities as time goes by.

* Time limits- Everything is on a strict time limit. Superman must be faster than a speeding bullet or he fails the mission. 

* Regenerative Health Bar- Neck down Superman's powers so he can be injured or pit him against Super-Powered

Personally, in the same vein, this trick would lose its luster if used a second time. I'd have an elaborate combo system. 

Say there's a group of terrorists in a tense standoff with police. Superman flies in, you fly in and x-ray vision tells you that there's 5 armed thugs. (Just like the Batman games.) Sneak up on one (sneak could by flying an inch off the ground rather than crouching. More Superman's style), knock him out. Two other guys are patrolling wait until they're alone and use super breath, heat vision or combat to take care of them quietly. In the last room, use heat vision to blow up a fire extinguisher... fly in, grab the two guys and fly them out the window to the police. Have a system where there's not mindless combat all the time (like in Superman Returns). Have a mode where you can slow down time, but Superman moves at his regular pace. To the other characters it would be as if he's using Super-speed. Don't use heat vision to blast scores of enemies all the time. It should be a precision device to melt guns

Basically

Anyway

Anyone have any other ideas of how to make an awesome game?",self,t5_2qrwe,False,,supes,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/16vloe/we_need_a_superman_videogame/

How can you find the same exact arguments repeated in the same industry and not think that there is something a bit fishy going on? I literally saw no unique criticisms about the movie, too much action, etc). Those are personal faults that they found with the movie, not faults that you could actually **measure against known solutions**.

The real problems with the movie, the movie tells a beautiful story and brings the fucking action. People seem to want the best of both worlds, and argue for it. Yet, when they finally have it - they compare it against other movies, like the Avengers, Dark Knight, etc

Clark shows restraint, it helps answer a nagging question about the origin of Superman's morals; he learned them. The Republic is certainly a book that a smart kid looking for moral guidance would seek out. Second

Krypton is a corrupted version of the Ideal City. The Rulers have lost sight of the Good (they lack Moderation and destroy the planet by over-using the core)








Now, and Krypton is the Ideal City. Superman has the Ideal City inside himself; he is a perfectly just being. Plato writes that the City is a ""city of the mind,"" an ideal to strive for. Superman is described the same way, as an ideal to strive for. A person who has internalized the lessons of The Republic, who can see the Good perfectly, would look a lot like Superman.

The drama of Man of Steel revolves around Superman choosing between Krypton and Earth. And even though every cell in his body is of Krypton

But why does Superman choose Earth? 








Plato wrote about education, and pass them. Superman went through many trials, and he resolved them by sticking to ideals and virtues that he trusted. He will risk being exposed to save a bus full of kids, but not to save his father. Seems like strange logic, but Jonathan Kent made the choice to sacrifice himself, and Superman honored that choice. He goes through growing pains, but generally shows incredible self-restraint. Superman is the embodiment of the Ideal City on many levels. He is Wise

So on the one hand

On the other hand is the political philosophy of The Republic

In Man of Steel, ethical philosophy against political philosophy, soul against city.









Krypton, because he's idealistic and has a strong view of the Good. And because he's wise and discerning, he takes a safety net along (the key). But Zod acts on bad faith, and Superman destroys them.

He destroys them mostly because he sees the corruption. Krypton had bad policies and bad leaders

On a subtextual level, but to change our souls.

I'm not sure if it's an elitist agenda against Snyder as a film maker or just nostalgic cinema fans who can't let go of the ""charming boy scout"" that set precedent over 20 years ago in Donner's camp-filled classic... but whatever the reason- Man of Steel is undeserving of the lackluster critical response it's receiving.

Man of Steel IS the Superman movie we've been waiting for.  And it really is epic.

No
This is not golden or silver age Superman- THIS is for every kid that watched Bruce Tim's ""Adventures of Superman"" and ""Justice League"" or the DC animated films like ""Doomsday"" or ""Crisis on two earths"" and said ""why can't we see THIS Superman live action?!""
This is for anyone who watched Matrix and said ""now... why can't we have a Superman that does this?"" (no.. i'm not saying it's like the matrix- at all)

Now, doesn't quite fit in- yet has a heart for people... a true good Samaritan, who even in the face of mockers risks his own life (to his knowledge) to save them... protect them.. you empathize with him.

The critics have it wrong- Clark's not dour in this movie
He's patient and compassionate. It's not apathy he's displaying... it's a disciplined reserve. He's a man who's learned that his power and how he chooses to use it will define who he will become. The truth is

This is someone who's never been able to have a real relationship with anyone.(outside of his mom and dad) and throughout the course of the movie he learns to trust people- exemplified in one person that sees who he truly is

My SPOILER LIMITED review. I can include one with Spoilers or you can PM me for some.

This movie did it for me. I give it an 8.5/10 and the flaws that it did have seem like they will be addressed in the next film. Comparing this to the Nolan's Batman franchise it's better than Begins, this is a reboot and it had to deal with origins which were pretty awesome to see. I don't think any comic reboot can be as good as TDK because Batman was already established when it came out and that's why I'm looking forward  to a sequel for this film. My only problems or the ""flaws"" that I had with this film were lack of time to develop a deep relationship with Clark and Lois. They do have great chemistry but It was a lot  harder to develop that without them SPOILER spending lots time together that they normally get from working the Daily Planet. SPOILER DONE I don't mean screen time either just time in general in the film. But I believe this will be solved since SPOILER he's working at the Daily Planet at the end of the film. SPOILER DONE That relationship should flourish even more than it already did. Their chemistry was GREAT. The only other flaw I had was there was some pretty noticeable CGI. I would of preferred that I didn't notice it but I'm nit picky. The film was beautiful visually and the parts I did notice didn't remove me from the experience I was having. It's not like it's during the entire movie either it's just in a few spots. I loved the pacing, flashbacks, Cavill was great as every persona and had his accent down perfectly, I loved the deep emotional feelings, I love how Superman did have to make a choice and boy was it a big one but I agreed with it. It was a beautiful film and had quite a few SPOILER Lexcorp nods from the building, a shipping type truck

Tried using Spoiler tags and couldn't figure it out.",self,t5_2qrwe,1370446848.0,,supes,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1fnn2u/im_seeing_man_of_steel_tonight/

Also to all of you who thought he was careless, longer than necessary, with an up and down, left and right head movement. I am assuming he is checking for damages, or survivors. 

---

One more thing

---

And if Superman actually used his super speed to save everyone (already if he reaches anything close to the speed of light his surrounding should go nuclear and go boom) do you think the people would survive him even touching him?

Look at Faora punching those soldiers. If Supes does the same without slowing down *significantly* he will kill all those people

Also, and other atoms and molecules in his surrounding, to explode. 

---

Lastly

OK

It is like blaming Batman for not killing the Joker and making it Batmans' fault. Yeah it is a philosophical question and the controversial ending of Zod can be argued this way. A good controversy that we all need and can freely discuss. 

TL;DR: Humans make so many mistakes and fuck ups that, he cannot be everywhere at once. Man of Steel Superman cares about people.

This film was AMAZING. I stopped watching the trailers somewhere after the 3 minute ""you are not alone"" trailer was released.

I grew up with Superman, I Loved his weakness to humanity. With all his power, the inability to save everyone hurts him most... and we saw that.

We saw just what superman would do for the good of humanity... We saw how far he would go for us. He made the conscious decision to Break the neck of the only other remaining kryptonian on earth. That is what I wanted to see in superman.
I've always thought ""well what if Superman had NO choice?"" and I was always given ""there's always a choice"".
Well with Zod

Lois Lane wasn't carried by the plot. She wasn't a damsel in distress. She knew what to do and when to do it

The film stood on its own. It paid homage to its predecessors

Seeing Superman stand under the beam from the kryptonian ship

There were inconsistencies, they put a LOT of thought and a LOT of care into this film; I feel like the film was done with Love.


The Superman I saw today is the superman I've wanted to see since I was a child. Absolutely NO expectations broken

1371132087.0,1g9n7u,Opinion Piece on the Rottentomatoes ratings,UrbanGimli,55,11,78,"Here is my opinion of what is going on.  Critics are resenting the tonal shift that has happened to the story/character.  The Donner films

The movie was released in the late 70’s a time not too dissimilar from our own in that our country felt like it was on the brink. The industrial sector was in decline, even water was being touted as something we had to conserve (Not that we shouldn’t –but this was the start of the Earth day/save the planet talk) Political corruption (Watergate) was still fresh in the minds of everyone. The cynicism of the time was expressed during the exchange between Lois and Superman on their date when he said he was for “Truth, Justice and the American Way” and her response was “You’ll end up fighting every elected official in this country”   That caused laughter throughout every theater in the country.  

So anyways, smiling conviction. 

For nearly 20 years Superman the Movie was THE Superhero movie you had to beat. Burton went a different direction that hasn’t held up the way Superman did. Some might say it was style over substance.  Nolan gave us a batman stripped down to its barest essence, nuclear bombs, and robot knee braces that repair years of damage.  Marvel stuck to their comic philosophy- Being a hero is fun, these are humans under the costumes, sit back and enjoy the ride. They embraced the popcorn with their films.

So now

Remember in the 70’s movie Clarks transformation from overwhelmed farm boy to pleasantly self-assured crossing guard happened during a montage of space school

This movie’s version of Superman doesn’t get there so cleanly or effortlessly.  I think the Critics are having a hard time dealing with the loss of that amused Superman. They were perhaps wanting another chance at having a Superman of their generation who inspired with a smile rather than fisticuffs. I say we were long overdue for this version if only to show another side of the character. This Man of Steel might grow into the more relaxed and self-assured smiling  Father figure, and less forgiving than Marvels.   Again, this is just my opinion.

Lots of things have been offered up in response to that now-infamous scene.  Some have said that Superman could have put his hands over Zod's eyes (hurting himself

This is all true.  However

Think of the chance Superman would be taking in prolonging that fight.  What if Zod won?  He would kill Superman, killing every human he can.  Billions would die and human civilization would be utterly laid waste, because with Superman gone, no one could stop Zod.  How could he possibly take that chance?  Yes, Superman is good and a paragon of virtue, but only a fool would play around with Zod at that point.  Much, MUCH too dangerous.  He really didn't have a choice.

On the other hand, what if he gets loose someday and kills Superman? It's ""Goodbye, human race"" all over again.

This isn't the DCU--at least

What's more, but he did it.  This is why I don't understand how so many self-professed purist super-fans--including even Mark Waid, who definitely knows better--can claim to be so scandalized and betrayed by Superman killing Zod.  This is nothing new, and it's not an obscure event or an alternate interpretation.  This is DC gospel, chapter and verse.  It is NOT some undreamt and unheard-of violation.

Now, is not one of them.

Near my public housing (projects) is a neighborhood of aesthetic Jews. I was going to a dungeon and dragons thing down by the south side of Brooklyn. In this neighborhood kids walk and run freely

I heard a engine approaching and by the sounds of it it was going fast and I saw it when I turned. A small minivan burning rubber down the street. Before I knew it I had already left the sidewalk and in mid stride heading to the little girl. I grabbed her and right when I thought I got her out the way the car passed and I felt part of it wizz passed the back of my hoody. It did not stop and when I turned it was turning the corner

I tried to tell the little girl to go home but she didn't speak English and was kind of scared someone not from her culture grabbed her. I'm guessing what seemed like her older sister grabbed her and went into a house and I was left walking to my brothers friends house which was close to the DND event. I was a bit shaken up when the reality set in that I could have died and by the time I got to see my brother and his friend. Was sweating and shaking. I told him what happen and he started to laugh which is always scary for my brother to do lol jk. He told me to look at my shirt. I thought I was bleeding or something so I looked immediately scared until I saw what he was pointing at. I forgot I put on my favorite Superman shirt.

I started to tear up immediately and cry a Lil when my brother hugged me saying I always knew you'd be a hero to someone.

He's one of my favorite characters and arguably the most iconic character ever created. I didn't really believe anyone could do him justice in a movie. A lot of my friends who have only seen the movies and never read any of the comics all think he's a boring character and I didn't want my mental image of him spoiled. The Man of Steel trailers however looked so good that I decided I had to see that one in theaters. Being the person that I am

Superman: The Movie-Absolutely amazing. Reeves did a great job and Brando's performance as Jor-El blew me away. Krypton's crystalline tech looked sci-fi enough that it was believably futuristic. The effects weren't great but they didn't really get in the way of enjoying the movie.

Superman II-It was okay. I loved Zod's performance, not an elf! Despite the good performance of Reeves and Stamp, the final fight scenes between Superman and the others suffered from the poor special effects (and as mentioned in Family Guy, the weird cellophane logo that he throws at Non). It really didn't feel like a battle between beings with god-like powers, it wasn't fast or loud enough.

Superman III-It was funny, albeit very briefly.

Superman IV-A few redeeming qualities but the majority was just weird. When Lex decided to make a clone

Superman Returns-Great special effects and camera-work compared to the previous movies. I liked seeing him fly faster. The story was okay too

1358717154.0,16y62m,My treatment for an awesome Superman video game,skinsfan55,38,4,15,"Well

SETTING: The game is set in the present day with a heavy influence from Birthright. It's shortly after Superman arrives in Metropolis, maybe an upstate NY vibe) and Superman has the option to fast travel to the Fortress of Solitude (some puzzle solving with information/artifacts he gets from game missions) or he can fast travel to Smallville. Make a huge, Just Cause 2 style map. There's no invisible walls per se, when Superman flies to a boundary have a fast travel screen pop up. 

PLOT: The game opens with Lex Luthor announcing plans to launch a satellite network of some kind. The goal of this network is to better mankind in some way but it turns out a shadowy figure (who we know as Brainiac) is supplying Luthor with alien technology. This technology creates a barrier around Earth that filters out the yellow sun radiation that gives Superman his powers. Luthor (portrayed as a xenophobe) is distrustful of the alien and begins making his own preparations to destroy Brainiac once Superman is eliminated. 

In order to distract Superman from their plans regarding the satellite launch, releasing classic Superman villians as he goes to keep him busy. 

Doctor Hamilton helps invent a hand held device to send rogue Kryptonians back to the phantom zone. One by one the Man of Steel defeats them

Meanwhile, emerges victorious and the Lex Corp sattelites are destroyed. 

Luthor deftly manages to save face throughout the ordeal and manages to steal much of the credit for eliminating Brainiac and building further xenophobic sentiment among some people. Still

GAMEPLAY: The majority of enemies are Kryptonian, and does not need to throw his punches. As many of the Kryptonian army have minor exposure to yellow sunlight they are easier to defeat than others. Build the idea that as an infant Superman displayed some powers, but needed to work for years to develop them to their current levels. Some bad guys are overpowered because of concentrated doses of yellow sun radiation. 

The game would be an open world where missions come up to advance the story. Some are random events

The Fortress of Solitude acts as a trophy room/area to consult Jor-El about the events of the game/analyze clues. This could be sort of like the Manor in AC3 or the Villa in AC2. 

Smallville is an area of importance as well. Say Kryptonains are drawn here due to the technology that exists from the crash. Superman must work with his parents

Have missions come up like GTA where you need to finish certain ones to unlock another mission strand. 

Environments need to be destructible

CONCLUSION: Surely, smooth gameplay, but I believe this works out the issues with Superman's invulnerability... the powers would be slightly less than they are now... (upgrades could even allow more health. One such upgrade may be his cells changing to derive more energy from the sun.) and he'd have a super powered army to fight. 

---

If such a game were made, John Shea as Luthor, etc. It'd be an original story, like the Arkham games which frees it from the limitations of any particular DC establishment. 

So... if a game like this existed,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,supes,t3_16y62m

Spoilers.",oaktownraider13,51,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1ge8ra/man_of_steel_was_flawed_and_failed_to_realize_its/, but there were two big flaws that it couldn't shake off

My first issue with the film was that they simply had to do too much (not tried, the charm and wit of The Avengers, and most importantly the quality of The Dark Knight. It had to accomplish this while staying true to the characters and the comics. 

It had to wash the bad taste that Superman Returns left in people mouths.

It had to satisfy its core audience

It had to become the next big franchise for Warner's after the end of the Dark Knight trilogy and Harry Potter.

A movie half as good would have been an impressive accomplishment considering the pressure that this movie was under. Had it not had so many things to satisfy

The flashbacks were handled poorly. I completely understand why they were done and why they were included and I had goosebumps watching them, and that hurts the overall cohesiveness of the final product. I think an additional 5 minutes of runtime where they transition from place to place would have benefited the pacing a little more.  The last half of the movie takes places over the course of a day and the first half could be days, could be months. At ties it kind of felt like we weren't watching Clark become Superman so much as a montage of his life. It's a problem that may be bigger for some people than others and while it didn't take away too much from my enjoyment, it was definitely noticeable. 

Now

First and the most important was Henry Cavill. Seriously, from growing up an outcast, to the bullies, to the vagabond life, to his inability to not help people, to his reaction to learning of his origins, down to his demeanor in the fights, but with Lois he is a completely at her mercy. Just an excellent performance.

The action: Some people complained that there was too much action; I feel like this was compensating for Returns

Amy Adams: She did an awesome job. I can see a lot of actresses taking on the role of Lois Lane. I can't see anyone else taking it on in this universe now that I've seen Adams. She had somewhat limited screentime but it was probably the finest example of ""more-is-less"" that I've seen in some time. Every scene she was in was just enough for the story. We didn't need to see every word of every conversation when she was tracking down Clark after the incident in the ship. We don't need a convoluted love story. Again

The Clark/Lois Relationship: While reading some of the reviews that said she was no more than a damsel in distress, one of his good deeds comes back to find him, and it's just his luck she's an ambitious journalist. So what does she do? The exact opposite of what any journalist ever would have done. And for the first time, Clark has an ironclad reason to give people as a whole a chance to accept him. I cannot overstate the effect this must have had on him. For as much a beacon of hope that he would eventually become, that was what Lois became for him first. You can see it in every interaction they have the rest of the movie. For Lois, Clark will always be this guy who A) saved her life and B) spent his whole life anonymously saving other people. Even if they never crossed paths again, their brief initial interaction would have permanently altered both their lives. The last bit about her character

Jor-El

Zod: Michael Shannon more than holds his own. Within the context of the story he's a very tragic character. The story arc between Superman and Zod is very well done. Clark doesn't see himself as belonging to Earth until Zod shows up and shows him that he is most definely not a true Kryptonian either. Of course it builds to the controversial climax which is what I most want to talk about.

That ending: Superman isn't Superman yet, meeting Jor-El as an adult, and meeting Lois. When Zod arrives, Clark is momentarily enticed by the prospect of rebuilding Krypton. For the first time in his life he sees an opportunity to not ""be alone."" When he realizes what this will cost ( the lives and civilizations of Earth) it removes any doubt as to where his loyalties lie and where home is. So by the final showdown, both Superman and Zod are at their physical and emotional limit: Superman for watching Zod destroy half the city and threaten then entire planet; Zod for Superman's perceived betrayal to his people and abandonment of his heritage by banishing the rest of the Kryptonian survivors. So when Superman has Zod in the headlock, and sees Zod so determined to destroy what he holds dear that Zod tries to murder a family in front of him, it is Superman that emotionally breaks first. This, was the best and most important part of the whole movie. We see superman at his lowest. We see him sacrifice his only link to his kin to save someone he doesn't know. We see him completely break down afterwards. Superman is on his knees you can just feel him giving up

Anyway, please feel free to let me know what you think.",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,1371295520.0,,

Clark Kent no longer works at the Daily Planet after standing up against the new direction of the paper. Still a journalist

In a brief interaction with Cat he makes another joke about the infotainment site (named clarkcatropolis.com) before realizing something: Cat's coffee cup is empty (just a prop) and her shampoo is of a lower quality than she usually uses. He begins to understand that Cat has put everything she has into this website

Cat is a nuisance, but she's a good person, and even Superman lost sight of that. I loved how they had him notice the little things before straightening up. It was a small scene, but it was poignant to me because even Superman forgot to notice the little things. He forgot to treat someone with the respect they deserve and was instantly sorry.

Looking at the mainstream on screen superman mythos (Donner films, smallville, [i.e. not comics]) There's always been such a difference between superman and Clark as if they are separate beings.  Clark, representing the best of humanity: humble, kind, caring, non-confrontational, lois and clark, strong


With Reeve + Routh


In Lois and Clark


In Smallville, and we almost wanted to see him become the Reeve's superman.  As the viewer, I found myself wanting him to be superman, and no longer Clark. ""When's he gonna fly? When's he going to put on the suit and *be* superman"" etc.


Man of Steel stands alone and does what it needs to as a re-imagining of the character for a broader, Clark was almost nervous to become superman thinking he 'couldn't be that good', or he'll make mistakes and people will suffer. Smallville's Jor-el kept saying ""your not ready"" for like 5 seasons.  Basically saying, your not experienced enough, your not ready for this new level of awesomeness, you will remain grounded till I find you worthy and let you fly. 


Man of Steel is different.  Both father's encourage Clark to embrace who he ALREADY is.  Yes Jonathan wants Clark to wait to reveal himself to the world, which we see all the time in the mythos.  Jor-El was amazing and was upfront with Clark immediately about who he was.  He didn't have to work for it, or level up.  Clark IS superman.  He is one in the same. A man of two different worlds.  There is no leveling up, he is already superman and his abilities developed (all of them) as he grew up.  The way Cavill portrays both was great.  I loved the way he interacted with Martha and Lois, I love how he talked to the army, and I loved the final scene of the movie.  


[SPOILER] I am very excited for the next DC film, super-ultra humble Clark? or the Clark we saw with Martha, on ships and oil rigs, making friends of old enemies (like the IHOP kid helping him up).  I absolutely love the WB animated films and STAS where Clark is a strong, confident reporter who even occasionally saves people as Clark still representing the best in humanity but not so distinctly different like Reeve/Routh.


TL;DR  I'm curious to where they go with the Clark/Superman dynamic but really enjoyed what they did with it and how Cavill portrayed Clark/Superman in MoS. Clark = Superman

For some reason I've never been able to connect with Superman the way I do with Batman. I've just always viewed him as a kind of giant rock that can't be hurt (unless someone has a green rock) and it just was never very relatable. He is basically invincible and I never saw how there could ever be any stakes in a story told about him. 

This movie did three things that made me able to relate

1 - It played up the sci-fi which is just a personal love (nothing I'm expecting anyone else to care for) and an angle on Superman I was aware of but never really appreciated till now. The scenes on Krypton left me wanting way way more of that

2 - It showed Superman as having a real choice to make and gave him a real hard decision to make. When the Zod fight started I was just like great here we go

3 - No hero worship. People are in awe of Superman without worshiping him. They act like real humans would, and hate. Not everyone but a lot, and that is where people like Lex will have their inroad to gain power. 

All in all I loved the movie and this proves once again that DC is the super hero's for grownups.

And there is that scene with only music and you see Pa Kent working on the car and Clark is over playing by himself acting like a superhero with a cape. When he puts his fists on his side and the music turned to the main theme I got goosebumps. You know right then and there that Pa Kent knew exactly the kind of greatness Clark was headed for. I just thought it was perfectly done to show that Pa Kent never doubted who Clark would become.  Another reason I'm completely obsessed with this movie and don't understand critics.

* **CADMUS is built from the ruins** - The government, they are a government branch, but we all know the sinister underbelly to CADMUS. (If you don't, watch ""Justice League Unlimited."")

Caution...this review WILL contain *MASSIVE SPOILERS*...Read at your own risk!



I know I'm late to this party. I'm sorry, I would jump at the chance.



On Sunday, and off we went to a showing of Man of Steel, in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, in 2D.



You couldn't imagine my inner turmoil at this point; have I been excited in vain? Will I be crushed and disappointed? Will I lose hope in a new, so I was just hoping and praying that they were wrong, that they were too critical, that they didn't ""get it"" like they should have. With popcorn and drinks in one hand, and my girlfriend holding the other hand, we walked into the cramped theatre and sat down in the middle row to finally pass judgement on this summer juggernaut. What's my verdict?



Like I said, $18: 2 tickets) Imagine my surprise to find that I could definitively state that critics were completely and unabashedly wrong on this one.



I never say this about a film, 300, and Watchmen, I know that Snyder makes movies that HE, as a fan, wants to see: he makes them from our perspective, and puts our wishes on the screen, for not cashing out and doing what critics want to see. At the end of the day, I can't say I blame critics for disliking Snyder, lives to be saved



While we're on the subject of tough decisions, he said so himself before he and Kal took their fight to the skies. ""This will end one of two ways Kal, either you die, or I do."" Zod would have incinerated that innocent family had Kal not stopped him by killing him. There was no other way to stop Zod, because now that he was gaining power from the yellow sun, he was just as strong as Kal, perhaps even stronger, and when he shed the suit, like he did when he let his father die, he was a murderer
Man of Steel was a thrill ride, that's not to say that if you share a critic's opinion that you're wrong. That's not what I'm saying; after all, you're entitled to your opinion. I'm merely saying that personally, I really enjoyed this film. Snyder did a miraculous job modernizing Superman and making him relatable to us as a whole. I mean, xenophobia is a current and pressing issue, so why not explore it in the easiest way possible?



Plus, and Snyder and Nolan's names were switched on the marquee, this movie would have had MUCH more critical acclaim than it presently has now. Names have a tendency to do that, unfortunately. And I can quite easily list another example if I needed to.



9/10 for me. It's as simple as that! It was a successful movie choice,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,bizzaro,t3_1ivo41

Past movies have looked at the Superman ethos and said ""Well, and throws in stuff like a forced romance sub-plot, a kid to attract younger audiences, etc.

To make a good Superman movie


**The Origin:**

This part is usually oversimplified in favor of moving the plot along

Krypton is a technologically advanced planet, yet their undoing is caused by not heeding Jor-El's cry for restraint for a new form of energy, and Kal-El is sent to earth, as we all know.

The situation on Krypton should echo our current struggle for environmental preservation- but can't be too preachy- because that's annoying and is really secondary to the main theme.


**Earth:**

Earth should be a direct contrast to Krypton, with either war or corporate ambition being rampant across the entire planet.

Kal-El's adopted parents should be very warm and emotional. They raise Kal-El as Clark Kent and teach him morality


**Powers:**

Clark's powers aren't simply a cool superhero gimmick

The stronger Clark gets, above the earth) and figuratively (his power separates him from those around him, isolate him).


**The Antagonist:**

The antagonist in the film is not just someone for Superman to fight- he should be a foil to superman to represent his inner turmoil. That being said: Brainiac.

Brainiac is a relic of Superman's home planet. He should come to Clark at the height of his alienation from the people of earth. Braniac doesn't come to Clark as an enemy

The conflict comes when Brainiac wants to extend the re-introduction of Krypton to the entire earth

Lex Luthor would not be THE antagonist of film


**Conclusion:**

The entire film is an analogy for Superman's inner-battle between his birth planet and adopted planet. The antagonists' motivations in the film should be similar to the motivations of the Kryptonian people. Brainiac

Lois Lane would be in the picture, most of the earth would be. Clark would be in love with Lois' humanity and even a little jealous of it. She should be able to empathize with others in a way that he is not really capable of.

I recall when The Dark Knight Rises first started gaining media momentum, I felt like I had spoiled so much for myself through absorbing everything the marketing team had thrown out there. I thought the whole intro, the football stadium explosion, or even the big police/prisoners fight scene were moments that would have been better left for viewers to have discovered at first viewing.  

Anyway, it seems like so much could be riding on this movie as Superman has not been done justice in the past by movies (The Christopher Reeves movies have their merit, but that's a different argument). So far, the only thing of Man of Steel that I have watched was the first teaser trailer shown at the beginning of TDKR. And it has been a struggle since I am a HUGE Supes fan, but I have to admit - it's really nice knowing nothing about the new movie. I haven't seen any new trailers, very few promotional photos that I couldn't avoid, nor have I read anything about it.

1. The latter half of the film gets excessive with the action. I tend to agree with this criticism. The *scale* of the action/destruction fit Superman well

2. The second criticism I saw many reviewers complaining about which I *majorly* disagree with is the idea that the film was too serious and lacked humor. 

I saw one review that claimed the film didn't crack a smile until the Army officer ""thought he was kind of hot"" at the very end. On the contrary, the timid priest, just to name a few. Yes, there wasn't A TON of humor, but I think many critics had their experience of The Avengers stuck in the back of their head, which to be honest, is a film that rarely goes two minutes without a moment of comic relief.

Man of Steel is a serious movie for the most part

I stopped them and asked if they were going to Man of Steel.  They said no I asked if they wanted to because I had two free tickets.  The father said he wasn't feeling good (called out of work ill) but his wife who was in the rest room might be interested.  I gave them the tickets and said see if she is interested and if not please pass them to someone else.

Well I thought they might have skipped using them (sometimes I don't find out if people do).  After the movie they came up to me and thanked me

Highlights


* Jor El recounting Kryptons History - Soooo much story potential. Yeah

* During Jor Els recounting of history the icon representing Clarks rocket looks like the 70's rocket (spikey)

* The picture of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane behind Clark in the Church as he weighs his decision to turn himself into Zod.

* It was clear to me that Zod wanted to die and forced Clark to kill him as his parting punishment. Death by Superman.

* Krypton loves tentacles.

* I want Faora to come back.

* I thought the single camera shooting worked well in some parts and poorly in others. 

* Having the Kryptonian's knocked around by our military weapons was very cool. 

* Extreme use of their heat vision seemed to hurt them or make them dizzy

* The colors of Clarks suit seemed to change in saturation levels scene to scene.

* ""Welcome to the planet"" ..great line. It hits clark on so many different levels. Earth is his home now

*  ""this man

*  The casual destruction of the tracking satellite was a bit much

* ""General

*  I felt like the same 3 musical cues (Flight

By moving extremely fast, the girl seems to disappear and walk through walls. Clark learns that Emily's father has been cloning her, with the help of green meteor rock. The flaw with the Emily clone is that she has no sense of morality, which eventually puts Lana in danger. Meanwhile, Lex prepares for his wedding with Helen.

1374263951.0,1inift,What do you think could have been improved in Man of Steel?,,26,9,94,"We've all seen the film




- Although the fight scene between Zod and Superman at the end of the film was a visual spectacle







- I was a bit disappointed that Superman didn't (directly) save many people in the final act. It was awesome when he destroyed the world engine




  


- I think that they should have shown Martha and Pa Kent before they found Clark's ship. I don't think that Martha was developed at all during the film and it was difficult to sympathise with her. In the comics (If I'm not mistaken) Martha badly wants to have children


  


- I think Clark was a bit too reckless in this film. His actions during the fight in Smallville could have led to many people dying. During these scenes, sociopathic alien) into an ""i-hop"" in which several people were present.    




  

- In my opinion

In any fictional story if one character has a gun and the other characters don't

Three ways to get around this are:

- Give the gunman a challenge he CAN'T overcome with just his gun (maybe his loved ones are in danger and he doesn't even know straight away). Give him a challenge that requires his intelligence and a strict adherence to HOW and WHY he's using that gun. 

- Find a reason for why the gun doesn't work (Kryptonite, etc). 

- Introduce a character with a BIGGER gun. 

The first option is how the best Superman stories are told. The second is how many Superman stories are told. The third is how most Superman stories are told. Superman is not too powerful. He has simply been too privy to a lack of imagination from bad writers and lazy readers.

* Is Superman too GOOD?

Any character whose nobility is greater than others could be perceived as 'too good'. Interesting stories are found when Superman's world is much like our own (dark
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* What is 'Man of Steel' about? Is it going to be really dark like the Batman movies?

Man of Steel is about an alien raised as a human being who discovers that he has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men and how he tries to find a way to use those abilities to help all of mankind. It's the origin of the Man of Steel for a new audience. 

Writer David Goyer and star Henry Cavill have REPEATEDLY stressed that it is not a 'dark' film by any means - merely a more realistic take on the character, simply that he has more difficult, humanising decisions to make as a result of his environment. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* I didn't like Superman Returns. Should I bother going to see 'Man of Steel'?

Yes. Superman Returns had nothing to do with this new film and the new film looks like it's going to be everything fans wished Superman Returns had been. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* What are some great Superman stories I should read to get to know the character?

Some of the most accessible Superman stories basically just retell his origin. Unlike Spider-Man or Batman

GREAT ORIGIN STORIES:

- Superman: BIRTHRIGHT

Birthright is the best Superman origin story ever, but overall I think it's a terrific Superman story and many friends of mine who aren't into comics found it superb. 

- Superman: Man of Steel:

Man of Steel was the 1986 miniseries that revamped Superman and streamlined his origin for modern comics. It's fairly dated now, his relationship with Lois and making his powers a bit more palatable (they 'depowered' him a bit, so while he's still phenomenally strong, he can't move planets etc). A very good book.

- Superman: Secret Origin

Secret Origin has some very good characterisation



BAD ORIGIN STORIES:

Superman Earth One

- I thought Earth One was quite awful. It excessively darkened Superman and made him mopey and unlikable. I sincerely disliked it. 


OTHER GREAT STORIES:

- All-Star Superman:

I don't really need to give this any introduction. A mammoth superhero epic written with wonder, but see through the first few issues and you're bound to love it. 

- Kingdom Come: 

Think 'The Dark Knight Returns' but for Superman

- Red Son:

What if Superman landed in Russia? An excellent effort by Mark Millar. 

- Superman Adventures

Also written with care and affection by Mark Millar (a lot of them, go no further than these stories. Absolutely outstanding books that I would show to aliens who'd never heard of Superman.
____________________________________________________________________________________________



* Isn't glasses a bit unrealistic as a disguise? Could that work in the new film?

Read Superman: Birthright. In that story, nerdy clothes and a less prominent posture, Clark is able to convincingly make himself appear like an entirely different person. 

Grant Morrison went even further with this in 'All-Star Superman' by explaining that Superman can actually contract his spine to physically make himself appear shorter as Clark - he also relaxes his muscles to appear flabbier as Kent and taut/ripped as Superman. When Clark's glasses are knocked off in one issue

Either of these approaches could work excellently in a new film. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________





* What are some great Superman TV shows?

Superman the Animated Series is quite good


Smallville is the story of Clark as a young man and while it started off promisingly enough

____________________________________________________________________________________________


Lois &amp; Clark is a great, buying a new apartment, falling in love with a co-worker (Lois Lane), etc. However, he's also the most powerful man in the world and he has to find a way to consolidate his life as Superman with his life as a mild-mannered news reporter. It's a very good series - cheesy at times (it was the 90s, after all), but very much worth a watch

____________________________________________________________________________________________


The Adventures of Superman is the classic black and white Superman show that became colour in its third season. Starring George Reeves (no relation to Christopher Reeve)

____________________________________________________________________________________________


'Superboy' is an oft-forgotten 80s/90s live-action series that has Clark become a superhero in his late teens while attending Shuster University. It's quite different from any version of the comics
