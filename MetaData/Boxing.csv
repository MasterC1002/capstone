1366142498.0,1chdpt,The sorry state that is women's boxing,youhavethenerve,596,82,155,"5 months ago, well... why not?

The co-main event was a fight between two female boxers. Jaime Ward vs. Alisah McPhee. 

While I never watched her previously

Ward had *some* hype behind her. She was a bona fide human specimen as she entered the ring. [This is a picture of her the previous day at weigh-in](http://i.imgur.com/Qenub5s.jpg).

Alisah McPhee was clearly there to be an opponent. As she made her way to the ring, it looked like McPhee weighed nowhere close to Ward.

As McPhee made her ring walk, ""Do you mind if I sit here and watch?""

""Go ahead

As the ring announcer was being prepped

My ears perked up. ""How do you feel about her making her pro debut tonight?""

""Scared

I had to ask her a question that was burning through my mind.

""Is she really 135lbs?"" I asked

""Oh God no

""What's she doing fighting a lightweight then?""

McPhee's girlfriend tilted her head as though it should all be obvious. ""Well

I nearly fell out of my chair. I was sure this was going to be a massacre. How dare the promoters put this poor girl in with the beast that is Jaime Ward!

The fight started. Over the course of the fight, and outboxed Ward. Using superior speed and footwork, McPhee made Ward look foolish. 

The judges gave a split decision to McPhee

***
Fast forward four months later. Once again

On the co-main event

Both Trupich and McPhee were taking on opponents who had soft records. But who won against their soft opponent that night? McPhee. Trupich got KOed by Johnson. Who was the fighter who dazzled with skill? It was McPhee.

***
Now I'll tell you something else that's interesting about McPhee. Despite not being a lightweight and having only fought as a pro twice

Shockingly

In the featherweight division

If McPhee cut weight

For comparison's sake, and 1589 men who compete as lightweights.

***
The reason I mention all this is because women's boxing has a very small talent pool. It's essentially what allows girls like McPhee to be the #48 lightweight in the world despite being a featherweight (who doesn't cut weight) and only fighting twice as a pro.

This small talent pool means the talent gap is wide. For instance

Simply put

***
Sadly

Yesica Bopp, she has not fought #2 Esmeralda Moreno or #3 Jessica Sanchez. The highest ranked opponent Bopp has fought is current #6 Ibeth Zamora Silva.

Bopp has never challenged herself

If women's boxing is to be taken seriously

***
Which brings us to the best possible fight in women's boxing. 

The two best female boxers in the world are Holly Holm and Cecilia Braekhus. Holm is a light welterweight while Braekhus is a welterweight. There's no question each woman is incredibly talented.

If either woman was to fight each other

But that fight is not happening.

Only 77 women fight in the light welterweight division

There's only one answer: a complete unwillingness to step up

***
Before I end this

Jackie Nava and Ana Maria Torres challenged each other — twice! —and fought two of the best fights I've ever seen!

Ava Knight stepped up and defeated the highly regarded Mariana Juarez. The lady is a class act and conducts herself with dignity inside and outside of the ring too.

His thinking was that since Trout had an argument for a win

Rather than giving him the exhaustive answer through PM, a boxing tradition.

**If you want the TL;DR:** it's yes and no :P

When people refer to championships in boxing

* Lineal championship - the oldest ""type"" of championship
* Alphabet organization championship - mandated by sanctioning bodies like the WBC, etc.
* Undisputed championship - the champion who holds all the titles of the ""major"" sanctioning organizations


## A Short History

The first lineal boxing champion on record is James Figg who became so in 1719. Until 1910

That means that some of the greatest champions in boxing history did not receive their championship by a sanctioning organization but by public acclamation. 

Daniel Mendoza

In 1910

In the 1920s

The NBA became the WBA in 1962.

In 1963

NYSAC ceased recognition of world champions in the 1970s to focus solely on sanctioning fights in New York State.

There was a leadership dispute inside the WBA

Hence the four ""major"" sanctioning bodies are:

* WBC
* WBA
* IBF
* WBO


The most major of the ""minor"" sanctioning bodies is the IBO which remains the only sanctioning body to institute computerized rankings.

In the 1970s, WBA, and IBF belts. In the late 2000s, the WBO was considered a ""major"" organization as well — so now you have to hold the WBC, WBA, IBF, and WBO belts to be the undisputed champion. 

Naturally

## The Lineal Championship

Traditionally, and you had to do so clearly. Just who was The Man? The Man was the man who beat the man who beat the man.

What would happen in the event The Man retired before he got beat? The lineal championship would be up for grabs when the universally recognized #1 fought the universally recognized #2. 

Now before we go trying to apply this tradition to modern boxing and modern MMA

Traditionally

This is why when we look at fights from the Jack Johnson era

Once they put a limit on the amount of rounds that could be fought

Obviously, so efforts were underway to create some sort of scoring system that was judged by observers outside the ring. 

At first, the referee no longer has the responsibilities of judging. That's placed in the hands of three judges placed at ringside.

The most commonly used scoring system right now is the 10-Point Must system - named as such because judges must award one fighter 10 points (before deductions for fouls).

I mention the evolution of boxing's rules because even though to gain the lineal championship

Current lineal champions have to adhere to current rules

For the record

* Akira Yaegashi (Flyweight)
* Guillermo Rigondeaux (Super Bantamweight)
* Sergio Martinez (Middleweight)
* Andre Ward (Super middleweight)
* Chad Dawson (Light Heavyweight)


All these lineal champions became so convincingly — so even if the old tradition does not apply

## Alphabet organization championship

The alphabet organizations are the ones who award belts — and frankly

The only requirement for being recognized as a champion by an alphabet organization is that they recognize you as such. In fact

The other side of the coin

Under the system of the alphabet organizations

## Undisputed championship

In the 80s

Of course

Yet another problem was that the alphabet organizations could remove their recognition of a champion for any reason whatsoever. In fact

Instead of paying him

Further casting doubts upon the ""undisputed championship"" legitimacy was something that happened during Lennox Lewis' undisputed championship reign. Don King paid Lennox Lewis $1 million to vacate his IBF title. Lewis accepted the money

***Round 11:*** Guerrero trying to make this ugly, and as a result he eats shot after shot from Mayweather. I give Guerrero credit, though. He keeps coming forward. 

*10-9 Mayweather

***Round 12:*** Well Guerrero has to go for broke because I have Mayweather winning this. Mayweather just getting on his bike now. He's potshotting, this may not be a blowout for Mayweather. Okay, near the corner Mayweather gets in some hooks. He's now throwing some rights. That's more like it.

What is Heredia's connection to Usain Bolt

&gt;“When people ask me about Bolt, if you don’t question that in a sport that has the reputation it has right now, you’re a fool. Period.”

Here's my other evidence which is not exactly 100% backed up.. but kind of implicates all of the Jamaican sprinting team. 

[Raymond Stewart was caught and banished for obtaining and distributing performance-enhancing drugs to his athletes.](http://www.examiner.com/article/olympian-and-track-coach-raymond-stewart-banned-for-life-for-drug-trafficking) Raymond Stewart and Usain Bolt [were both coached](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Mills) by Glen Mills. In 2009

What does Marquez think of testing? 

&gt; “I think that you can say anything that you want


On March 30

&gt;“What is your response to fans insisting Marquez was doped up vs. Pacquiao in the 4th fight?” I asked Heredia last week via Twitter.

&gt;“No dope. (Marquez) is a drug-free athlete

&gt;Heredia maintained that their camp had no issues regarding blood and urine testing against Pacquiao in fights 3 and 4

&gt;“We asked Pacquiao for test (blood/urine) then before 3, please do. It will give him credibility,” he wrote then added, “Manny Paquiao has a history of denying blood sample testing, so what you (sic) say about that? Have you ask (sic) him why denying then?”

He raises a good point. If Pacquiao's camp was adamant and suspicious of the involvement

Now

&gt;Pacquiao didn’t think much of Heredia’s involvement with Marquez

Was it Pacquiao's fault he lost? Yes

&gt;“I believe if Pacquiao wouldn't (sic) skipped Ariza's training

Fair enough... but what about Marquez. Could he have won without Memo?

&gt; “No. Juan developed speed &amp; power with my training. My training methods made a tremendous difference - that difference was the KO.”

Heredia is caught in more lies than Victor Ortiz. 

&gt;Heredia has been caught in numerous lies over the past six months. I personally asked him


&gt;They were seen together weeks ago and both denied that they were working together. In other words, said, “Honestly, who gives a (crap) if I didn’t tell nobody?”

&gt;Brandon Rios told BoxingScene.com

What about his involvement with Guillermo Rigondeaux?

&gt;Here he is quoted as [saying he is](https://twitter.com/Ortiz_BoxingNBA/status/280479938635784193) (dated 16 Dec 12) per Team Rigondeaux [he's not](http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/02/25/13/team-rigondeaux-denies-working-memo) 

What is Memo's contribution to designer drugs and what is his opinion on doping in sports?

&gt;“Designer drugs are composed of several different chemicals that trigger the desired reaction. At the end of the chain

&gt;“Track and field, either. Soccer? Soccer players come to me and say they have to be able to run up and down the touchline without becoming tired, and they have to play every three days. Basketball players take fat burners like amphetamines, ephedrine. Baseball? Ha ha. Steroids in preseason, amphetamines during the games. Even archers take downers so that their arm remains steady. Everyone dopes.”

**What effect or benefit does working with Memo grant you? Said another way

On July 18th, 2008 he bests that with a 9.76s. That kind of elevation in performance in sprinting is suspect. One year later he set the world record with a 9.58s in Berlin. 

On November 11, 2012 Pacquiao was out for the count and is still sound asleep in the MGM Grand. 

Okay now

Bradley is quoted by boxingscene.com as saying:

&gt;""If anyone was worried on either side

Excellent! Finally

Marquez [speaks out](http://www.boxingscene.com/marquez-bradley-battle-over-rehydration-clause-testing--66837) (again via boxingscene): 

&gt;""Bradley he wants to do the anti-doping test. I'm ready for that. But this is not a rule for the fight. I want after the weigh in

Why? At 5'6 Bradley is damn near exactly the same size as Marquez with only 2 fights at 147 (and Bradley nearly lost both by stoppage.) Let's compare their size.

Bradley is quoted as saying:

&gt;If he wins, NO FIGHT. The fight is over. That's what I said right now. He gotta get tested.** 

Are you saying Marquez is on PEDs (he's asked. 

&gt;**""No, he's gotta do USADA and VADA. It's both companies in my contract. I don't give a shit what Bob say.**

I'm curious if all of the people who are saying that the scores were bullshit and that 116-112 from one judge is unreasonable actually scored the fight.  I'm betting you didn't.

I scored this 114-114 with **six** rounds marked as basically even rounds that could have gone either way.  Looking at my scorecard that means I could easily have scored the fight anywhere from 9-3 Marquez to 9-3 Pacquiao and not thought twice about it.  

That means on my scorecard if I happened to call all of the razor thin rounds one way or the other I could **easily** scored this 117-111 to **either guy** and not been upset with it.  

Seeing a score of 116-112 means that one of the judges

Can you seriously watch that fight and tell me that there were no rounds you thought were basically even?  Can you tell me there was a decisive winner to the first round for instance?

At the end of the day this fight was amazingly close and the scores reflected that.

But the significance of this event has ramifications beyond one individual’s potential to be a superstar. To explain these ramifications

Different cultures like England, China also has such a tradition. 

About 2, this book disappeared from print. Nevertheless, traditional Chinese martial arts such as Xingyiquan, Choi Lai Fat, and Wing Chun — while implementing techniques *beyond* boxing — place special emphasis on fist techniques. 

When Westerners came to China, and the sport grew rapidly.

In the 1920s

Then after World War II

Unfortunately

Then in 1979, Ali was seen hugging Deng. After this visit, Deng exclaimed, “If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals”.

Boxing in China was reborn in 1987 when the ban was lifted. Chinese boxers began training again. Lacking the proper equipment, once again China competed in boxing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 

Then in 2004, it would be significant. But he was just getting started.

In 2005 and 2007

Then 2008 Beijing Olympics came. Shiming met Serdamba in the finals. Millions of Chinese tuned to watch these rivals compete. In the course of the fight

China would win another boxing gold medal in the 2008 Olympics. Zhang Xiaoping would win one at light heavyweight. These two medals marked China's arrival as a power in amateur boxing.

But there was no doubt that Shiming was Chinese boxing’s biggest star. After the 2008 Olympics

At 31-years-old, he won his second Olympic gold medal.

Which now brings us to this moment in time. Zou Shiming

China already has a championship fighter in Ziong Zhao Zhong who holds the WBC title at minimumweight. They also have several exciting prospects in the pro ranks — one of whom is Rex Tso who’s promoted by Ricky Hatton.

But just as Zou Shiming marked China as a great power in amateur boxing

What will the future hold? Brian Viloria

1375515830.0,1jm877,So I lost,fred_carver,78,9,40,"Hi guys

I definitely out boxed him and was fitter than him but the guy punches so so fucking hard it isn't true. Also from the first time he hit me my plan went out the window and we brawled. Also I kept letting him have straight rights down the pipe into my face: I have bad head movement anyway and after the first one I stopped boxing smart - also I thought I could wear it and come back with an overhand right and I did do this quite impressively a few times - but dukeing it out with someone who has about two stone on you is a pretty stupid move

Won the first round and some people think if it had gone on for thirty seconds longer I would have had him out of there. I think that is a very very generous assessment.

Second round he hit me the way a train hits you - blood everywhere

Third round we were both very gunshy - him because he was knackered and me because I was still seriously hurting from the second round. So we stalked each other for a while and then when we finally closed it all got very messy but he definitely got the better of it with his power and with my total inability to get my face out of harm's way. Judges gave it to him 29-28 which is totally fair.

Anyway:

* Thanks for all your advice
* I've always had a lot of respect for anyone who steps into the ring - especially the pros - even if they are not very good. That respect has just gone up to a whole other level. Jesus guys how do you wear those kind of shots for 12 rounds? You are supermen.
* I don't feel at all bad about losing. I gave it my all and I'm not going to die wondering.

[SPOILER]",youhavethenerve,83,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/16xw7c/on_last_nights_offtv_undercard_a_no_hope_italian/

Now to talk about what happened. Coming into the fight

He was at a height disadvantage: Ferrante is 5'11"" compared to Akberbayev who is 6'3"". Ferrante also had a reach disadvantage: 73"" compared to Akberbayev's 75 1/2"". Finally

Ferrante was also coming off two straight losses in a row: to Dhafir Smith (25-22-7) and Omar Sheika (31-11-0). His record of 12(7)-4 wasn't as pretty as Akberbayev's 10(7)-0. 

Watching both men enter the ring

In R1

Akberbayev knew afterwards that he had impose his will on Ferrante. In R2, it looked like things were going to script.

R3-5 were all Akberbayev. He was punishing Ferrante for R1's insolence. How dare Ferrante come to fight! Yet

But things changed in R6. A right hook by Ferrante opened a large gash over Akberbayev's eye. The sight of his own blood seemed to incite terror in Akberbayev — sapping all his aggression. 

Ferrante seized the moment. From that moment on, you could visibly see the bone. The tide had turned!

In R9

Right before the final round came, ""but the judges won't let you! You got to knock him out!""

Watching this fight

Was Ferrante going to heed his corner's advice or was he just going to survive? At the start of R10

At 1:19 of R10 (the final round)

Akberbayev collapsed to the canvas face first — cold! The sight was both chilling and sensational. For several minutes

1321327643.0,mcm92,The Beginner's Guide to Watching Good Boxing Fights,youhavethenerve,78,6,26,"*I've noticed we're getting quite a few new boxing fans in this subreddit. As a service to these new fans

""Every time I attempt to get into boxing, along with, ""Do the good fights ever happen?""

Be assured that they do happen, here's a handy guide on how to separate the wheat from the chaff.

But first

**Why am I not watching the good fights?**

If you're from North America

Ross Greenburg has never been a boxing fan, and gave boxers who didn't deserve it high paydays -- even though they didn't bring in high ratings.

Thankfully, despite having a significantly lower budget than HBO. This means better fights are on the horizon.

Unfortunately

**Where can I find the good fights now?**

For American viewers, it is *near* top tier -- and offers more entertainment value than the heavily hyped fights on HBO.

But if you're unconcerned about top level talent, Fox Deportes, and TeleFutura are all American Spanish TV networks that regularly match up-and-comers with grizzled vets. The result is often KOs, upsets, and assorted fireworks.

If you are more adventurous, Main Event in Australia, TV Azteca in Mexico, and RTL in Germany.

**Do talented fighters make good fights?**

Not necessarily. Good fights are about good styles match-ups, the result will be a snoozer. What you need to find are two fighters with opposing styles that complement each other.

Understanding styles may take time

**How often do good fights happen?**

Literally every week. Nearly a hundred fights happen each week

The reason why these fights don't necessarily get a whole lot of love is because boxing is a sport with international appeal, every high profile international fight is a click a way, and is often available on YouTube within 24 hours.

**What's the profile of a good fight?**

Before tuning in to a fight, if there's a lot on the line, and a win promises bigger and better things -- chances are there will be fireworks.

Another factor (as previously alluded) is styles. If you match to counterpunchers together, if you match a boxer-puncher against a counterpuncher, as in Pacquiao-Marquez, the result will be fireworks. Brawlers are almost always crowdpleasers, even against themselves -- as was the case with the Gatti-Ward trilogy.

Finally, and Ricky Burns, he always pushes his opponents to bring out their best.

**If a fight is a Pay Per view

No. Pay-per-views are based on the names on the main event, not names. This is why certain high profile PPVs, such as Pacquiao-Clottey, ended up as disappointments. 

In contrast, that become legendary. A good example of this would be Wolak-Rodriguez I, which was broadcast on ESPN2 for free. This was a classic styles match-up between an out-boxer and swarmer.

So am I saying that it's never worth it to buy a PPV? Not at all. Look for main events that are sequels

**What about potential legendary superfights?**

Sadly

That said

The key

**How do I get started?**

Keep informed. The best way to start is by gauging what boxing *fans* think of a fight

A Statistical Breakdown of the Heavyweight Division,youhavethenerve,70,6,43,"I decided to do an analytical breakdown of where the heavyweight division is now and where it is going. Why? Because the heavyweight division remains boxing’s glamour division. It is the division with the most casual appeal. 

The best means of assessing boxing’s health is to therefore assess the heavyweight division.

As you’ll see next

This simply is not true. In fact

I will now present an overall analysis of the world heavyweight scene

First, IBF, WBO). The reason is that much of what you see there is quite political, and much of their rankings are contingent upon geography. For instance, why is Kyotaro Fujimoto ranked 25th by the WBC when he has a 5-1 record? It's because he recently challenged for an OPBF belt — a regional title that counts for little in today’s heavyweight scene.

In order to assess who is the highest quality heavyweights, RING Magazine). 

As well, and they’ll probably remain so until they retire.

As you can see here

Now a few interesting facts pop out at me:

*	Apart from Robert Helenius, or a communist/post-communist state. In Odlanier Solis’ case, he’s from Cuba yet resides in the USA.
*	In the top 25, Manuel Charr, Jean Marc Mormeck.
*	Even as the media mourns the death of American heavyweights
*	It is easy to surmise that almost half of today’s heavyweights wouldn’t be able to compete if there was still an iron curtain.
*	A prominent number of heavyweights who originate in (post-)communist countries now reside in the USA. Examples: Tomasz Adamek
*	While there are many elite heavyweights that reside in Germany

This is all well and good

	1.	David Haye - UK
	2.	Tyson Fury - UK
	3.	Robert Helenius - Germany / Finland
	4.	Johnathan Banks - USA
	5.	Tony Thompson - USA

	23.	 Malik Scott - USA

	25.	 Maurice Harris - USA

As you can see above, 13 originate in the USA. The only other country with large representation is the UK: 3 are in the top 10 and 5 are in the top 25. Curiously, Edmund Gerber is the only one who both resides in Germany and originates in Germany. 
Thus, they’re doing pretty well for themselves.

This is all interesting as a snapshot for *now*

*	Must be undefeated
*	Must be 30-years-old or younger

According to Boxrec

	1.	Tyson Fury - UK
	2.	Robert Helenius - Finland / Germany
	3.	Vyacheslav Glazkov - Ukraine / USA
	4.	David Price - UK
	5.	Francesco Pianeta - Italy / Germany

	22.	 Richard Carmack - USA
	23.	 Bogdan Dinu - Romania
	24.	 Tomasz Hutkowski - Poland
	25.	 Newfel Ouata - France

The IBO shows a similar picture. Please note that because the IBO only ranks 100 fighters per division on their website

	1.	Robert Helenius - Finland / USA
	2.	Tyson Fury - UK
	3.	Vyacheslav Glazkov - Ukraine / USA
	4.	Francesco Pianeta - Italy / Germany
	5.	David Price - UK
	6.	Bryant Jennings - USA
	7.	Andrzej Wawrzyk - Poland
	8.	Deontay Wilder - USA
	9.	Denis Boytsov - Russia / Germany
	10.	 Artur Szpilka - Poland
	11.	 Erkan Teper - Germany
	12.	 Andriy Rudenko - Ukraine / USA
	13.	 Joe Hanks - USA
	14.	 Andy Ruiz Jr - Mexico / USA

Boxrec shows 7 Americans that originate in the USA are far as the top 25 prospects are concerned. The IBO shows 3 fighters who originate in the USA as country of origin. 

Yet what’s also interesting here is that

As it turns out

All across the eastern seaboard of the US, Artur Szpilka an emerging star, and Vyacheslav Glazkov a soon-to-be star. 

The split between the USA and Eastern European scene is soon going to blur.

But just for shits and giggles

	1.	Tyson Fury - UK
	2.	Robert Helenius - Finland / Germany
	3.	David Price - UK
	4.	Francesco Pianeta - Italy / Germany
	5.	Bryant Jennings - USA
	6.	Deontay Wilder - USA
	7.	 Andy Ruiz Jr. - Mexico / USA
	8.	 Joe Hanks - USA
	9.	 Erkan Teper - Germany
	10.	 Alexander Flores - USA
	11.	 Oscar Rivas - Colombia / Canada
	12.	 Vincent Thompson - USA
	13.	 Matteo Modugno - Italy
	14.	 Arnold Gjergjaj - Switzerland
	15.	 Fred Allen - USA
	16.	 Richard Carmack - USA
	17.	 Newfel Ouata - France
	18.	 Gary Cornish - UK
	19.	 Michael Wallisch - Germany

	21.	 Justin Jones - USA
	22.	 Dillian Whyte - UK
	23.	 Aaron Green - USA
	24.	 Didier Bence - Canada
	25.	 Jordan Shimmell - USA

Removing (post-)communist countries from the equation

	*	11 Americans
	*	4 British
	*	2 Italians
	*	2 Germans
	*	1 Mexican
	*	1 Colombian
	*	1 Finn
	*	1 Canadian
	*	1 French
	*	1 Swiss

The continental breakdown is as follows:

	*	13 North Americans
	*	11 Europeans
	*	1 South American

What’s the point of all this? Simply this: Americans are probably doing just as good as they did before. However

Even as Eastern Europeans now compete professionally

These are interesting times for the heavyweight division.",,t5_2qj0l,1360098306.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/17wc58/prepare_to_have_some_myths_shattered_a/

They were fetching the luggage (Miss Jackson included) from the carousel and his huge body guy was with him against the wall. I politely ask the body guy if I can take a pic. He said no

I'm smirking away from them. I just got the Mayweather mouth barking at me!  Haha how bizarre? But wait...what's even more bizarre is his reversal of mood at the mention of Guerrero. Shit did I mix up oponents? It's early and before I went to his body guy I had to remind myself Guerrero, pissed at Guerrero, pissed that I'd wish him luck or is it off with Guerrero?

Call me crazy, I was in his presence for like five seconds. Something with Guerrero has to be up.

It's likely none of the above. We'll see. Regardless

**edit**: I wrote this draft this morning

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/floyd-mayweather-robert-guerrero-bout-just-rumor-004200679--box.html

I totally struck a nerve this morning. Fucking crazy! 

FWIW

&gt;All we know is that Mayweather felt the need to make his statement directly to the public while Schaefer apparently felt the need to go directly to the media in response. Of course

Did I necessitate this statement? Ha--again how bizarre.

In this post, and rankings.

### So how is it that there's a lineage of champions stretching down from 18th century England?

Simple. The ""championship"" is decided when the two best acknowledged fighters step in the ring. This is called the [lineal championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_championship).

### Who are the acknowledged lineal champions today?
The acknowledged lineal championship list is quite short. The lineal champions today are:

* Wladimir Klitschko — Heavyweight
* Chad Dawson — Light heavyweight 
* Andre Ward — Super middleweight
* Sergio Martinez — Middleweight
* Nonito Donaire — Super bantamweight
* Toshiyuki Igarashi — Flyweight

### So is the lineal champion the best in his division?
No. For example

Igarashi won it in a close split decision win against Sonny Boy Jaro — a journeyman fighter who himself won the lineal championship by beating Pongsaklek Wonjongkam just as Pongsaklek got old.

The best flyweight, Omar Nino Romero, Giovani Segura, and Julio Cesar Miranda.

### What's the deal with sanctioning body titles?
Think of titles simply as a trophy that some organizations (of variable prestige) award fighters. The best comparison I can make is to tennis.

In tennis, until you reach the final. Whoever wins the final wins the Wimbledon.

Boxing works generally the same way. The IBF

Mind you

### But what's more important: the championship or a title?
Becoming a recognized lineal champion is much more prestigious than holding a title. The lineal championship happens because ""the man beat the man"". However

A title, it has an organization that gives a fighter recognition. To a fighter, holding a title is the difference between getting attention and not getting attention — so it's still damn important.

### What about rankings?
Each sanctioning body has their own rankings. However

Traditionally, RING Magazine's quality has slipped.

Recently, Boxrec is generally less biased than the sanctioning bodies and promoters.

### Why isn't there a boxing league like there is with football or basketball?
Actually

However, is still competitive and has given us some of the most memorable fights in combat sports.

Seriously guys watch it again (with the volume muted if you must) and you'll see that its a much different fight. Marquez never got to dominate Pacquiao. Manny dictated the pace and actually out boxed Marquez and countered Marquez's counters.

We got so used to Manny throwing hundreds of punches and steam rolling his opponents but in this fight he decided to box. Manny is a victim of his own success.

I'm not excited about Sergio Martinez vs. Andre Ward, so there's just no good reason to discuss them.

Boxing is much more interesting when you tune in to the fights that *are* happening. Donaire is going to fight Nishioka. Brandon Rios is going to fight Mike Alvarado. Brian Viloria is going to fight Hernan Marquez.

## Julian Williams vs. Dashon Johnson
***Round 1:*** Julian Williams pumping the jab, countered with a right by Johnson. Johnson tries with a few hooks, but Williams has answers for them. Williams keeping his distance and launching hard jabs whenever Johnson gets into the killzone.

*10-9 Williams*

***Round 2:*** Williams and Johnson both exchanging at the center of the ring. Williams looks to be hurting Johnson with his hard combos. Things getting slightly scrappy here as both fight on the inside. Johnson gets a few shots in

*10-9 Williams

***Round 3:*** Johnson hurts Williams causing Williams to do a jig at the center of the ring. Now both these men are going toe-to-toe, for his part, is tiring but still able to get in his shots. Wild shot by Williams gets in! Johnson falls into the ropes! Williams pounces! The ref stops the fight!

**Official Results:** Williams TKO3 Johnson.

## Omar Figueroa vs. Abner Cotto
***Round 1:*** Figueroa going for the kill early. He pounces on Cotto and doesn't let up. Left hook brings down Cotto. Once Cotto gets to his feat and beats the count

**Official Results:** Figueroa KO1 Cotto.

## Jermall Charlo vs. Orlando Lora
***Round 1:*** Charlo pumping the jab, Charlo nails him. Charlo keeps pumping the jab, dinging Lora over and over again. Lora to the body. Now Charlo comes at Lora with a chopping right. Lora keeps coming forward, not adjusting, and Charlo is more than happy to hurt him as he comes in.

*10-9 Charlo*

***Round 2:*** Lora's face is already busted up. I can't imagine this going for very long either. Lora is trying to be more careful, is able to mix things up, but Charlo is replying with his own shots. Charlo is now doubling down with the hooks, and Lora's not reacting well to them.

*10-9 Charlo

***Round 3:*** Charlo's jabs are setting him up nicely for the left hook. Lora keeps getting dinged as he comes forward. You got to wonder how many of these jabs and hooks Lora's going to eat. Points for Lors for toughness since he just keeps coming forward and closing the distance. 

*10-9 Charlo

***Round 4:*** Lora keeps coming forward, Charlo's defense makes it hard for him to connect cleanly. As the round goes on, Lora's eye looks more and more messed up.

*10-9 Charlo

**Official Results:** Ref takes a look at Lora's eye and stops the fight. Charlo TKO4 Lora.

## Austin Trout vs. Canelo Alvarez
***Round 1:*** Trout moves first, gets a few off. Trout now with a hook gets in cleanly. Canelo tries to get his own in, lunges, and Trout makes him pay. Then Canelo swarms Trout, tries for the body, but doesn't hit Trout cleanly.

*10-9 Trout*

***Round 2:*** Trout keeps pumping the jab at the center of the ring. Canelo gets one to the body, but Trout takes it well. Canelo doing a better job of measuring the distance. Trout continues with the jab, but Canelo is beginning to time Trout.

*10-9 Canelo

***Round 3:*** Trout continues with the jab. Canelo is now trying with his own jab, and he follows that up with a straight. Trout now unloads with jabs, and straights to the body. They're beginning to mix it up. Trouts jabs keeping Canelo honest, as he's not able to get inside. But he does get in one body shot. The exchange at the bell.

*10-9 Trout

***Round 4:*** Canelo stalking Trout. With a stiff jab, getting his shots in, punctuated  with the uppercut. Trout successfully potshotting, but Canelo's jabs are really hurting Trout now! Trout comes back with a straight, but these Canelo jabs have something on them!

In contrast

But let's face it. Russell-Gusev was nowhere near the best fight of the week. Hell

The best fights last week that I saw were the following:

* [Javier Garcia Roche vs Ivan Sanchez](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8wLW_Q1WzI)
* [Carlos Cuadras vs. Victor Zaleta](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxx4ve_2013-03-02-carlos-cuadras-vs-victor-zaleta_sport#.UTVRues4WjE)
* [Donnie Nietes vs. Moises Fuentes](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxyd3o_2013-03-02-donnie-nietes-vs-moises-fuentes-abs-cbn_sport#.UTVSqus4WjE)

I love all three of these fights for differing reasons. 

Roche-Sanchez featured Sanchez getting knocked down twice in R2 only to work his ass off for a TKO5 victory. The fight was recorded at ringside with a handycam. It was a war between two Spanish domestics who'll be lucky if they'll ever reach continental title contention.

Cuadras-Zaleta was a showcase for Cuadras, Cuadras was very much fighting a live dog who came to fight. Zaleta was knocked down — hard! — by Cuadras and was saved from obliteration by a merciful ref.

As for Nietes-Fuentes? It was a war. Not a brawl

If I compare these three fights to Russell-Gusev

So... what's going on here? Two things:

1. **In America

2. **The best fights almost never have hype.** Pacquiao-Marquez IV was an oddity. It was a fight that actually lived up to the hype and perhaps surpassed it. The majority of great fights, and often out of sight of most fight fans. To amend the words of Chuck D, it's not just that you *shouldn't* believe the hype, it's that you *should* believe the un-hype.

So how

    Good records + Comparable ratings = Great fights

This isn't always true but it's often more true than not. 

""It sure looks like you have to do a lot of research to know what good fights are coming up

You are correct. But I have good news for you. You don't have to do any research because I've done it all for you. Every week, but I often find that a *little* research allows me to unlock a world where fights are excellent every single week.

My past experience with Mayweather and Pacquiao fights has shown me what to expect from this subreddit. So for those of you who haven't been subscribed to /r/Boxing during superfight weeks

Lots of casual and even non-fans of boxing are going to make their way to this subreddit because a Mayweather fight is boxing's equivalent to a Superbowl event. Even for those who don't care about the fight itself

Without any adieu...

## Ground Rules

They're not much different from the way our rules typically are

* Keep spoilers out of the titles of submissions for at least 24 hours after an event airs.
* When a submission is going to contain spoiler filled discussion inside please have some form of spoiler warning in the submission title. Exceptions are made for Official Fight Threads.
* Threads comparing boxing to MMA will immediately be removed.
* Do not request streams of fights.

As well

* Discuss whatever you want. Trash talk but keep it civil.
* Please adhere to [Reddiquette](http://en.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)
* Have fun

Remember the Golden Rule

## If you're new to /r/Boxing
There's lots that happens here on a weekly basis that you might want to check out.

For instance, and live round-by-round coverage. The comment threads are fairly active. It's a regular party.

Beyond that, and often assist those who are new to the sport of boxing.

I'd like to think that

## If you're a longtime /r/Boxing subscriber

Remember that Mayweather/Pacquiao fight weeks are *always* different from other weeks here. As such

There will be many people who are unaware of how boxing works. Many visitors here may not know how to score a fight

As well

Take it all in stride. If someone goes a little too far

## Finally

I love superfight weeks. It's not because I love superfights, I believe boxing offers action that cannot be found elsewhere.

1361916981.0,19ab0g,Puerto Rico vs Mexico; A Boxing Rivalry (Part 1) ,Ianian58,43,3,18,"**History**

The atmosphere is something special as two fighters walk into the ring followed by the support of their people

The two fighters trade blows, and then, suddenly half crowd begins to chant;

*Mexico

The Mexican lands powerful blows against his opponents, sending blow after blow.

Now the chanting crowd goes silent as the other half suddenly takes control of the arena as the chants of *Puerto Rico

The Puerto Rican-Mexican Rivalry is an incredible rivalry

It was 1960, 32-0, and it was set to be quite a match. 

But Torres was surprisingly outclassed by his Puerto Rican opponent before being knocked out in the tenth round. It was the first major bout between a Puerto Rican and Mexican Fighter. 


**Wilfredo Gomez and Salvador Sanchez**

The rivalry would officially begin to take shape more than a decade after that bout when another Puerto Rican Fighter simply was blowing away a the 122 division. 

In his prime he would be 32-0-1, by knockout. The man was named Wilfredo Gomez, and he was the perfect fighter at 122. He had cleaned up the division, his victims included Mexican Fighters Tirado, Lopez and Medel. 

And for one of his notable bouts

Zarate was easily sent to the canvas four times as he was defeated in the fifth round by his opponent. Though many had expected it

But Gomez's win streak. Enter another Mexican Legend

Gomez moved up in weight to face the Mexican Sanchez who interestingly enough was on a win streak against Puerto Ricans

Mexicans tuned in to the fight, already a popular fighter in Puerto Rico drew thousands of Puerto Ricans to watch in the fight. 

The two Latin Americans rushed to the middle of the ring for the first

And after eight

The defeat of Gomez, and epic rivalry that would soon heat up once more with the arrival of a an All-Time-Great.

Julio Cesar Chavez. 


**Top Five Mexicans and Puerto Rican Fighters of All Time**


**#5 Mexican Fighter**

Juan Manuel Marquez - A modern All Time Great who needs no introduction in today's boxing world. Winning seven World Titles in four different divisions. Having a record of 55-6, Orlando Salido, and of course his epic rivalry and victory over Manny Pacquiao. His six losses come against tough opposition, including his pro debut, and later in his career which includes Floyd Mayweather, Chris John, Freddie Norwood and Manny Pacquiao. A master of the counter-punching technique; many actually consider Marquez the greatest Mexican Fighter of All Time.


**#5 Puerto Rican Fighter of All Time**


Juan Laporte- Mentioned in the first part of the history segment, yet with grit and courage Laporte racked up enough wins to challenge Salvador Sanchez. Sanchez had 40 wins, while Laporte had only 15 wins, and one loss. Sanchez though was surprised, as the two fighters fought it out for 15 rounds, making the Mexican Legend work and won a handful of rounds though he ultimately lost.

He beat Rocky Lockridge and lost once more at his second World Title Shot
After racking up more wins he fought for a vacant title against Mario Miranda

He kept fighting, in a very close decision Chavez triumphed over Laporte, and many believed that Laporte actually deserved the decision. 

In 1989 his son died, Gomez, Sanchez or all the other greats he came so close to beating.

1371995023.0,1gwoyw,Thoughts on Broner-Malignaggi,artistformerlyknown,39,1,82,"I'm going to check in as a huge Malignaggi fan born in NJ
A few thoughts on last night’s fight:

1.)	Work rate and ring generalship are subtly different things. Malignaggi won rounds by workrate, while Broner was limiting his real estate to do so. It wasn't a black and white accomplishment, but what helped him foil Malignaggi's ideal plan and win the fight.

2.)	Yes

3.)	Malignaggi may have indeed presented a (I’m sure there are other ways) blueprint to beating Broner.  If he had more power, have a good chin, and get off fast.

4.)	Broner is asking the fans to choose who he fights next.
Let’s face the fact that Paulie’s true home is 140.  He got bigger over the course of his career
Some might say – but wait a minute!  Broner skipped a weight class to win this fight.  Yes.  And he was still the bigger man in the ring.  I have no idea how he was managing to make weight before.  Boggles my mind.  In all fairness

5.)	Malignaggi says he’s financially OK without having to fight again.  Did this fight leave too much of a bad taste in the mouth to retire now?  He hurt his hand yet again, but as one dimensional as that makes him, I love watching his style knowing that he is risking his life behind a punch most fighters use to establish distance and timing.  But who’s next if anyone?  Or has he become too bitter...

I, so I decided to do a statistical breakdown to see if I’m able to predict any star-making trends. To do this, I decided to take a look at three major sources: Nielsen Ratings, Google Trends, and social media. I attempted to be as exhaustive as possible while not neglecting the bird’s eye view.

I’d like to offer one additional caveat. Futurists have a saying: “He who looks through crystal ball shall later eat glass.” So though these statistics show a broader trend

### Nielsen Ratings

Let’s now look at the strongest metric for star-making: Nielsen Ratings. For this study

	1. Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.-Marco Antonio Rubio, 1.9 million
	2. Bernard Hopkins-Chad Dawson, 1.6 million
	3. Chavez Jr.-Andy Lee, 1.4 million
	4. Adrien Broner-Vicente Escobedo, 1.4 million
	5. Miguel Cotto-Austin Trout, 1.4 million
	6. Nonito Donaire-Jorge Arce, 1.3 million
	7. Andre Ward-Chad Dawson, 1.3 million
	8. Floyd Mayweather-Cotto PPV replay, 1.3 million
	9. Manny Pacquiao-Juan Manuel Marquez PPV replay, 1.3 million
	10. Danny Garcia-Amir Khan, 1.3 million
	11. Erik Morales-Garcia I, 1.2 million
	12. Robert Guerrero-Andre Berto, 1.1 million
	13. Marcos Maidana-Devon Alexander, 1.1 million
	14. Broner-Antonio Demarco, 1.1 million
	15. Sergio Martinez-Matthew Macklin, 1.1 million
	16. Canelo Alvarez-Josesito Lopez, 1.0 million

We can safely surmise that Hopkins, Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. are already stars. 

Moreover

* Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. - faced a loss to Sergio Martinez. It is doubtful whether his career momentum can be sustained.
* Danny Garcia - faced a fighter (Amir Khan) with greater name value than himself. It would be better to assess a fight in which he is the definitive A-side.
* Marcos Maidana - he’s got a cult following

I have therefore distilled these fighters as ones who are “the future” while also attracting more than 1 million viewers:

1. Adrien Broner
2. Nonito Donaire
3. Andre Ward
4. Robert Guerrero
5. Canelo Alvarez

Some important notes to consider:

*	On this list
*	Nonito Donaire was on HBO four times
*	Ward-Dawson was Andre Ward’s first fight on HBO as an A-lister — having spent the bulk of his career on Showtime
*	Alvarez-Lopez was shown during the exact same night as the Chavez-Martinez PPV

So that settles it

### Google Trends

Next

| Name | Average Volume |
|:-----------|------------:|
| Canelo Alvarez | 10 |
| Nonito Donaire | 5 |
| Andre Ward | 3 |
| Adrien Broner | 3 |
| Robert Guerrero | 2 |

Now for peak volume:

| Name | Peak Volume | Date |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| Canelo Alvarez | 100 | September 2012 |
| Nonito Donaire | 56 | December 2012 |
| Andre Ward | 39 | September 2012 | 
| Adrien Broner | 29 | July 2012 |
| Robert Guerrero | 16 | July 2012 |

To summarize Google Trends, his closest competitor. Ward and Broner have identical volumes, but Ward’s volume is due to a larger peak date than Broner’s. As for Guerrero, why did July find more volume than November?

To answer this question

## Canelo Alvarez - Regional Interest

	1.	Mexico - 100
	2.	United States - 30
	3.	Argentina - 11
	4.	Spain - 4
	5.	United Kingsom - 3

As we can see here

## Nonito Donaire - Regional Interest

	1.	Philippines - 100
	2.	Mexico - 19
	3.	Saudi Arabia - 6
	4.	Spain - 5
	5.	United States - 5

Popularity in the Philippines is expected. After all

The other surprising point of interest here is that Mexico has far more interest in Donaire than the United States. I suspect that this has to do with Donaire’s wins over Fernando Montiel and Jorge Arce — both fighters who are hugely popular in Mexico. In addition

## Andre Ward - Regional Interest

	1.	United Kingdom - 100
	2.	Romania - 97
	3.	United States - 77
	4.	Canada - 48

Amusingly

For the United Kingdom

As for interest in Romania and Canada, but this hope was dashed after his decimation by Froch.

Ward did not have much appeal in the United States

## Adrien Broner - Regional Interest

	1.	United States - 100
	2.	United Kingdom - 75
	3.	Canada - 35

Surprisingly

But why the interest in the United Kingdom? The answer is that there’s been much hype of an eventual showdown against Scotsman Ricky Burns who’s often considered Broner’s equal in the lightweight division.

## Robert Guerrero - Regional Interest

	1.	Turkey - 100
	2.	Mexico - 55
	3.	United States - 54
	4.	United Kingdom - 34

The reason for Turkey’s high interest is simple. In July 2012

As for Mexico

### Social Media

I’m now going to cast my eye towards three social media sources: Twitter

Twitter is particularly useful because much of the data is public


| Name | Follower Count |
|:-----------|------------:|
| Guerrero | 162
| Canelo | 161
| Ward | 152
| Donaire | 84
| Broner | 67

Right here, it is easy to monkey around with Twitter follower counts. If you have the money, you can buy them. 

Follower count should therefore be balanced with keyword comparison as well as mentions count. Here’s the drilldown of each fighter by keyword and mentions during the past few weeks.

| Keyword | Hits |
|:-----------|------------:|
| “nonito donaire” | 33% (1
| “adrien broner” | 25.2% (1
| “robert guerrero” | 23.6% (1
| “canelo alvarez” | 12.3% (618) |
| “andre ward” | 5.9% (294) |


| Twitter Handle | Mentions |
|:-----------|------------:|
| @filipinoflash | 33.3% (2
| @adrienbroner | 25.5% (1
| @canelooficial | 18.1% (1
| @ghostboxing | 12.1% (764) |
| @andreward | 11% (691) |

(If you’re curious why I only have data for the past few weeks

What’s interesting here is that though Donaire and Broner have far less followers than Guerrero, they have far more keyword and mentions counts. In fact, for both Donaire and Broner, the numbers are consistent: 33% and 25% of keyword hits and Twitter handle mentions.

The next thing to look at is Facebook Page likes. I like to compare Facebook to Twitter due to the userbase of Facebook being more casual than Twitter’s. Fans on Facebook are different from fans on Twitter.

| Name | Facebook Likes |
|:-----------|------------:|
| Canelo | 310
| Donaire | 154
| Ward | 24
| Broner | 5
| Guerrero | 4

As you can see, and Guerrero’s likes are far lower than their Twitter follower count.

It’s easy to see why Broner has a lower follower count on Facebook. He’s more active on Twitter, is a ghost town.

Finally, one of the most visual social media sites should therefore be assessed.

| YouTube Keyword | # of Results | View Count of Most Popular Video | 
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| “nonito donaire” | 6,025 |
| “andre ward” | 4
| “canelo alvarez” | 4
| “adrien broner” | 2
| “robert guerrero” | 1

Nonito Donaire not only has the most videos uploaded of him, but his most popular video only has 210,744 views — which has the smallest view count. 

Canelo, is in 3rd place by number of results.

### Bird’s Eye View of Trends

What should we make of all of this? It’s clear that though Adrien Broner has brought in the highest ratings during 2012

It’s also my personal belief that Canelo has more casual appeal while Donaire has more hardcore appeal. I deduce Canelo’s casual appeal by Twitter follower and Facebook likes count

So what to make of Broner? There is no doubt that he has appeal amongst Americans. As well,,False,,t5_2qj0l,1360880690.0,,True

However promoting a huge fight in Macau is definitely the way to go. 

I'm reading a lot of comments on how bad Macau is

I must disagree and say all these statements are in accurate and based off of some older stereotypes. A simple google search will reveal that Macau in 2008 or so started generating as much revenue as Vegas. And fast forward to 2012 Macau now generates 5 times the revenue as Las Vegas. All the wealthiest people in China go to Macau.

If Las Vegas is Sin City. Macau is the Devil's playground for the rich and elite. You can do things there that you would never get away with in Singapore (wanna orgy in a hot tub with 100 hookers from all over the world? Go to Macau). You see many of the wealthy (who are connected to the government which also happen to be the biggest spenders) choose to go Macau because they simply can't be caught splurging their money overseas.

[TL;DR](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-casinos-in-macau-make-las-vegas-look-like-a-dump-2012-7?op=1) 

Edit: If you're not into gambling then Macau is kinda lame. I'd rather go to Vegas and enjoy the nightlife/shows. Macau is purely made for gambling/prostitutes and honestly not much else. Hong Kong is only a boat ride away though.

1365993001.0,1cd4rz,On Purists and Blood-thirsty Ghouls,youhavethenerve,42,7,32,"Donaire-Rigondeaux has generated a lot of discussion here on /r/boxing. 

In fact

There seems to be two factions regarding the ""goodness"" of Donaire-Rigondeaux: purists and blood-thirsty ghouls. To the purist, and execution. To the blood-thirsty ghoul, boxing is about the action, the viciousness, the wars.

Purists think blood-thirsty ghouls don't know what they're seeing. Blood-thirsty ghouls think purists are full of elitist crap.

Frankly

### The Sweet Science: The Purist's Perspective

""Boxing is like jazz. The better it is

And if good boxing is like jazz

It's not just about punches — it's about what happens between punches. The purist looks for ring generalship, and precision. 

Purists love watching fighters like Floyd Mayweather Jr., to the purist, it is artful violence. 

### The Cruelest Sport: The Blood-Thirsty Ghoul's Perspective

""Boxing is just show business with blood."" ~Frank Bruno

Supposedly

Boxing is about so much more than technique. It is a metaphor for life: both men entering the ring, missed punches — and Hail Mary haymakers capable of snuffing out consciousness.

The blood-thirsty ghoul loves the war because it tests each fighter's character. He is thirsty for blood not because of morbid curiosity

### The Irony

The irony

Two weeks ago, it barely made a dent in the media.

Contrast this with Donaire-Rigondeaux. Radio City Music Hall was sold out — filled to capacity. The fight was a top trend on Twitter. As much as journalists — and some posters here — complained about the fight being ""boring""

The further irony is that as much ""purists"" seem to be the only ones interested in seeing a ""pure"" boxing match, but when an all out war is about to happen, it seems they're the only ones excited enough to buy tickets.

The purists aren't so elite. The blood-thirsty ghouls seem to be the only ones who know what they're seeing.",,t5_2qj0l,1365994168.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1cd4rz/on_purists_and_bloodthirsty_ghouls/

To answer this question

Picture the sport of boxing to be a high school in a Middle American suburb with each major sanctioning body as somebody notable on campus. 

* WBC — The celebrated quarterback who drives around in a yellow convertible Camaro blasting Pitball songs. He often hooks up with members of the cheerleader squad while all the while having a not-so-secret penchant for hot Latinas.
* WBA — The college boy hanging around at all the hot parties who everybody thinks is cool but is really just there to bang as many semi-attractive high school chicks as possible — and keeps lowering his standards.
* IBF — The hipster who rides around on a fixie, they will escape to New York City together.
* WBO — The new kid who just immigrated from Puerto Rico. He just wants to be liked by *any* somewhat attractive girl

Mayweather is the buxom lead cheerleader who is “officially” an item with the WBC but who everyone knows has fooled around with the WBA. That’s all cool with the WBC

However

What Mayweather may not know is that the IBF is *totally* not up for it.

The IBF wants someone he can share mix CDs with. The IBF wants someone he can twirl around in the rain at midnight with. The IBF wants someone who can help him understand what it’s truly like to be *in the moment*.

The IBF wants... Kell Brook.

Complicating all of this is that the IBF is currently going out with the gawky

Unbeknown to the IBF

We will use these rankings as a starting point.  In the future, although official decisions may or may not be left up entirely to group vote.  

Without further ado:

**r/Boxing's Heavyweight Division:**

**CHAMPION: Wladimir Klitschko 58 - 3 (51 KO's)**: Our champion, every possible challenger willing to step up has been either devastatingly or embarassingly turned away.  Having notched his 15th defense without breaking a sweat, Little Brother Klitschko is walking down the same path as Joe Louis and Larry Holmes.

1. **Vitali Klitschko 44 - 2 (40 KO's)**: If lineal championships were as fractured as the sanctioning bodies would like you to believe, as the elder Klitschko settles for 1st runner-up.  That's not as bad as it sounds.  The Klitschko's thirst for belt dominance has been quenched, and as Vitali nears retirement, he'll have quite a healthy career to look back on.  With one of the highest KO percentages in heavyweight boxing, Vitali's resume is supplemented by the fact that his only two losses were freak results that shortened fights he was winning.  That's something our #2 man would like to change...

2. **David Haye 26 - 2 (24 KO's)**: For once, one has to give Haye a bit of credit as a ""live underdog"" in that potential bout.

3. **Alexander Povetkin 24 - 0 (16 KO's)**: As a heavyweight beltholder with Olympic Gold pedigree, Povetkin nabbed an ""interim"" title beneath our Champion and has avoided Wladimir ever since. But, while his skills don't necessarily negate his stature when compared to a Klitschko, Povetkin does the next best thing.  He beats almost everyone else.

4. **Tomasz Adamek 46 - 2 (28 KO's)**:  The former champion will probably never make it to the top of these rankings, Tomasz Adamek uses his relative hand speed, (mostly) granite chin, and respectable power to keep himself in perennial contention.  His performance was a bit flat against Chambers, but despite Chambers' injury, Adamek did his job in securing another victory and another step towards a title shot.

5. **Yoan Pablo Hernandez 26 - 1 (13 KO's)**:  If you don't recognize this name, earning some belts along the way. But his reign might be short lived, as his follow-up defense comes against the skilled ex-Contender Winner, Troy Ross.

6. **Marco Huck 34 - 2 (25 KO's)**:  He talks a lot of trash, seemed destined for the B-tier until he stepped up to the plate against Alexander Povetkin.  In a gutsy, dogged performance, Huck controversially lost to the favored Povetkin.  Since then, he's talked a lot about his desire to fight Vitali, but his sights might be better aimed at a smaller, less potent opponent

7. **Cristobal Arreola 35 - 2 (30 KO's)**: Let's get this out of the way.  Arreola is fat. He's always going to be fat. But he's also always going to be entertaining.  He fights like light heavyweight, as his KO percentage suggests.  

8. **Denis Lebedev 24 - 1 (18 KO's)**: After a strong showing in his split-decision loss to Marco Huck, he knocked out Roy Jones, Jr. and outworked James Toney.  But that doesn't mean he's not worth watching.  He likes to fight, and he packs enough of a punch to make things interesting.

9. **Robert Helenius 17 - 0 (11 KO's)**: While many fighters could be here in the place of Helenius, Lamon Brewster, and Sergei Liakhovich make for decent scalps on this growing prospect's resume.

10. **Eddie Chambers 36 -3 (18 KO's)**: Eddie Chambers is highly skilled but low-powered.  He wins fights with speed and footwork. Despite his physique, in his last fight, he injured his left arm, losing his jab, and fought competitively against Adamek for 12 rounds using only 1 arm.  Guts.   **NOTE**: Eddie Chambers and Krzysztof Wlodarczyk received the same amount of points, but Eddie Chambers received more votes, thus narrowly earning the position.

1374069042.0,1ihh5g,"Poor Rigondeaux... (Casual ""fans""...)",paperball86,42,5,31,"Alright so with the recent(ish) news of him being dropped from HBO

For instance, Delvin Rodriguez, Austin Trout, Abner Mares, Leo Santa Cruz, Nonito Donaire... ect. Shit who knows who Andre Ward is or GGG. Who knows who Juan Manuel Marquez is (maybe people know him as the guy Pacquiao always fights), but do they appreciate his skill?

Now with that out of the way

My point is this, it's boxing fans... In my opinion, its the PROMOTERS job to PROMOTE their fighters. Will every boxer be a star like Mayweather, Pacquiao or Canelo (If you have red hair and box maybe), no, not likely but there is NO reason Rigondeaux doesn't deserve air play... the guy just SHITTED on Donaire. Straight befuddled his ass. Mind you I'm a huge Donaire fan, I was PISSED watching that fight as a Donaire fan.

1. Donaire is better than that performance (Me and my Girlfriend were yelling at our computer monitor...)

2. Yes Rigo danced a lot and didn't initiate action but he's a counter puncher/boxer.. STYLES make fights. Donaire respected him too much to take a risk and catch him... thats not Rigo's fault. You have a elite boxing technician counterpuncher versus and elite boxing technician counterpuncher (who adapted his style to make KO's). But he's fighting a world class A+++ technical guru sooooo that adaptation may not work aaaaaand as we saw


3. Rigo turned up the heat later on


4. This is Rigo's first ""co-headliner"" I say this because Nonito was the main attraction. Ward has shitty ratings and he's just as classy of a boxer. 


Moral of the story is I think it's bullshit. He wasn't given another fight to adjust his style to ""enterain"" the ""casual"" fans. The dude left his family behind in Cuba to seek out his dream of being a professional figther... won a billion gold medals

It's like Andre Ward, P4P #2 only under Mayweather (WHICH you could argue however Mayweather has more ""Stripes"" than him). Why the fuck isn't he more popular. Majority of America is Christian, he's a devout Christian... all around good person. You know how many children don't have fathers and could be influenced by Andre Ward...? The dude could be a beacon of hope and inspiration... Shit's rediculous, he grew up in OAKLAND, not a pretty city and is now the 2nd best fighter in the world... No story there.. nah. People LOVE Pacquiao, he's a sweet heart in the public's image, despite the adultery, and gambling...


Anyway fuck this bullshit

Pros: This stance almost leaves no room for the straight right to hit you. And almost all jabs and uppercuts are useless because they can be easily dodged. The stance also allows for the fighter to easily lean back to avoid a flurry. 

Cons: Only VERY FAST fighters can use it properly. A power puncher almost has no chance using it. The stance opens a possibility of hitting the body/kidney of the side facing the boxer.

***
As Canelo-Trout gets closer

Some fans believe a fight should be judged by what happens inside the ring

***
I like Austin Trout. He's one of the few elite boxers who knows where he comes from. He appreciates the fans. On Twitter

Though he's fighting in front of a crowd of 38, it's back to fighting in front of smokey community halls of a few hundred people. In boxing, you're only as good as your last win. Even though he has a 26(14)-0 record, if he were to lose on Saturday, everything he's fought for could evaporate. 

In this, he was supposed to be the opponent, but Trout pulled out the win — often in front of hostile crowds.

Trout still struggles for attention. 

Being a slick African-American from New Mexico who refuses to talk trash

Hence

***
As I said, in Panama against Nilson Julio Tapia. 16,000 fans were packed into the Roberto Duran Arena. 

Who was in Tapia's corner? Roberto Duran.

""He's an American

But Trout was no bitch. Dispensing with his usual slick counterpunching style, he had difficulty answering Trout's aggression.

The weird thing about that fight was that it was only for 11 rounds

***
A year and a half later

And why wouldn't he? Trout was inactive for 15 months. Alvarez, Trout should have been beatable too.

But Trout put on a boxing clinic. At first he used his jab to keep Alvarez off balance, Trout nailed Alvarez with left-right combos to Alvarez' head and body.

The crowd was stunned. Trout won the fight. Sitting in the audience was Rigoberto's brother and Austin's future opponent: Canelo Alvarez.

***
Last December, this was supposed to be an easy win.

Trout turned the tables on the largely Puerto Rican crowd that night. As Cotto tried to stalk Trout, Trout would outmuscle and outhustle him. The result was a unanimous decision win for Trout.

The win was so definitive, Cotto left the ring without giving reporters an interview.

***
Meanwhile, Alvarez drew well over 60 million Mexican TV viewers. He looked like the future of Mexican boxing — and indeed he still does.

But it wasn't until his KO of Carlos Baldomir that Canelo began receiving notice in the USA. At that point, they sat up and took notice.

The Baldomir fight, this is unfair to Canelo since he's only 22-years-old, but facing the likes of Kermit Cintron and Shane Mosley didn't do him any favours either.

Nonetheless

***
A large part of Canelo's appeal wrests on his good looks and wholesome personality. He has the same appeal in Mexico as Oscar De La Hoya has in America — but with a style that appeals to Mexicans. This wholesome persona began to crumble with an alleged altercation outside the ring.

It was October 2011, IBF light flyweight titlist Jorge Solis was going for a run when he claimed to have encountered Canelo. Canelo, angry with Solis' involvement with one of his ex-girlfriends, punched Solis — hard! Solis broke his jaw, lost a few teeth, and had to get surgery.

Because of this, lost out on a lot of potential opportunities.

Solis filed charges against Canelo. Canelo, Canelo pressed on with his career, and it was thought that Solis was never going to get justice.

***
It's a known fact that Canelo was pressing for a Cotto fight. Canelo-Cotto would have generated big money

As it happened

Golden Boy therefore looked to set Canelo up with Alfredo Angulo. Angulo, Angulo would have been cannon fodder for Canelo. 

But Canelo didn't want to fight Angulo. He wanted to fight Trout. While Schaefer wanted to ""explore more options""

Why did he insist so emphatically? Revenge.

Canelo could not forget Trout's fight against Rigoberto — a fight that derailed Rigoberto's career.

Many people question the revenge angle. They think it's a product of marketing. However

Why? Because if Canelo's the kind of person to break Solis' jaw due to baby momma drama

But that all implies that Canelo's a completely rational human being — which I don't think he is.

***
Yesterday

It is now two days before the fight and you got to wonder if the prospect of jail time is weighing heavy on Canelo. 

Canelo has yet to comment on his impending arrest

“On Saturday, ""I will raise my hand and my belt and will be thinking of my brother.  That belt is his.""

One wonders if Canelo is also thinking of his *other* brother. Juan Alvarez

***
Canelo-Trout isn't a fight that exists in a vacuum. It's as much interesting for the stories that have happened outside the ring for what may potentially happen inside of it.

Canelo better be ready to fight Trout. If he's not ready

Because Trout is the kind of man who finds a way to win even when he shouldn't.",,t5_2qj0l,1366337523.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1cn9on/canelotrout_penicillin_out_of_moldy_bread/

1347123144.0,zk7ks,"A Big Day for Boxing:  September 8th, 2012",spacetits,37,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/zk7ks/a_big_day_for_boxing_september_8th_2012/, **keep spoilers out of the titles of submissions for the first 48 hours after after an event airs**.  There will be threads dedicated (with ""Spoiler"" tags) to the discussion and thoughts on all the fights for today

Here's a list of the fights and card start times for today:

*  Vitali Klitschko vs. Manuel Charr (2:30pm EST and on HBO at 9:45 EST)
*  Tony Bellew vs. Edison Miranda (3:30pm EST)
*  Lucas Matthysse vs Ajose Olusegun (9:00pm EST on Showtime)
*  Antonio DeMarco vs. John Molina (on the undercard of Ward/Dawson)
*  Andre Ward vs. Chad Dawson (9:45pm EST on HBO)


There are five high-level

**Klitschko/Charr**
While this fight will probably not be competitive as Vitali looks to be in great shape and has barely lost a round in almost 10 years, and I see him getting stopped in about 5-6 rounds. The pick:  Vitali Klitschko TKO6 Manuel Charr.

**Bellew/Miranda**
This fight may not be high-profile, so the pick here is Tony Bellew UD10 Edison Miranda.

**Matthysse/Olusegun**
This fight became the headliner for this Showtime date after Randall Bailey pulled out of his fight with Devon Alexander, and if Olusegun can weather an early storm, he might be able to last into the middle rounds.  Olusegun doesn't have the power to keep Matthysse at bay, and I don't see this fight going the distance.  The pick here is Lucan Matthysse KO 7 Ajose Olusegun.

**DeMarco/Molina**
If you need any indication of DeMarco's ability to turn a fight around, got frustrated, or made dumb mistakes, but he took his time and wore his man down.  Every time I think of that fight, my mind immediately goes to Linares bending over with rivers of blood streaming from his face.  It was a sight.  DeMarco is a very good southpaw boxer-puncher.  His only stoppage loss was to Edwin Valero and who can blame him for that?  Molina is no slouch either.  He's got the power to end a fight and the skill-set to use that power efficiently.  This is a very good lightweight match-up.  Expect fireworks.  Also expect DeMarco to get a couple of tough spots early on in the fight to eventually win a close decision.  The pick is Antonio DeMarco UD12 John Molina.

**Ward/Dawson**
This is the fight of the weekend.  This is a huge fight.  It is not often that two lineal belt holders from two different weight division get in the ring together and go at it.  The last time this happened was when Ricky Hatton (140lbs) stepped up to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. (147lbs).  That was 4 years and 9 months ago (thanks Boxingscene).  This type of thing does not happen often, it's a big deal.  Ward is fresh off winning the Showtime Super Six Tournament and Dawson just captured the lineal Light Heavyweight title from Bernard Hopkins this past April in dominating fashion.  Dawson challenged Ward to this fight in the post-fight interview and the fight was made very quickly.  If Dawson comes forward behind his jab using combinations, Ward will have a very, very tough night.  But if Dawson plays it like the first 10 rounds in his fight with Jean Pascal, Ward is going to be able to jump in and out with ease while tagging Dawson with 1 and 2 punch combinations.  Neither fighter has shown the ability to produce knockouts at this level, so it very safe to assume that we are in for a 47-minute affair with these two.  The smart money (and mine) is on Andre Ward with a decision tonight, but it's hard to say that when you see Chad Dawson throw these 3,5-punch combinations so fluidly.  I think that Ward takes the first 3-4 rounds, and the Dawson Slam.  The pick here is Andre Ward UD12 Chad Dawson.

*Arreola vs Mitchell* - After Seth Mitchell avenged his only loss in a long

*Chavez Jr vs Vera* - Coming off a decision loss to Middleweight King Martinez, those wins include Dzinziruik and Sergio Mora. Chavez Jr always has entertaining fight, Vera will make it entertaining.

**September 14**

*Mayweather - Canelo* - I do not believe a bigger fight has been made since De La Hoya - Mayweather, the young, undefeated fighter touted as the next P4P King, and Floyd Mayweather, the P4P King, a fight of the crossroads. Sure, there may not be fireworks or knockdowns, one so massive I doubt we'll see anything like it until the next few years.

*Mathysse - Garcia* - The top dogs of the dangerous 140 division. Expect fireworks

**September 28**

*Fury - Haye* - Many observing the heavyweight division pointed towards English prospects David Price and Tyson Fury, arguably one of the best heavyweights in the world, third only to the Klitschkos. This is a massive step-up for Fury, but it should be an entertaining fight.

**October 5**

*Klitschko - Povetkin* - Speaking of heavyweights, any opponent hoping to beat either Klitschkos, especially Wladimir Klitschko, would have to pull off the boxing upset of the year. And then enters Povetkin, the number one contender, many give the rugged Russian Olympian a solid chance to defeat Wladimir, if anybody can hope to dethrone the Klitschko rein as of now

*Cotto - Rodriguez* - Continuing the action that very day, the winner here will have a solid title shot once more, Cotto always an exciting fighter, and Rodriguez, hoping to take the opportunity Cotto has given to many will hope to upset the Puerto Rican star.

**October 12**

*Bradley - Marquez* - Marquez is coming off one of the most stunning knockouts in boxing history. Finally settling the score with rival Pacquiao, he came off an exciting win over Prodovnik in a Fight of the Year Contender.

**October 19**

*Prodovnik - Alvarado* - Fireworks

**October 26**

*Hopkins - Murat* - Hopkins continues to flip off Father Time as he breaks his own record for being the oldest champion in boxing history

*Kell Brook - Vyacheslav Senchenko* - Kell Brook has been a solid welterweight contender for a while now, and it has the potential to be explosive.

**November 23**

*Froch - Groves* - When Andre Ward ~~abused~~ decisively defeated Carl Froch, Ward was left out in the dark. Froch stubbornly refused a rematch even though Ward gave into every demand, and for some reason decided to fight Groves. And while Ward is annoyingly left in the dark, Groves get a shot of a life time, he impressed me in his last outing and he has the potential to upset Froch, fireworks will go off. But not just in England.

*Manny Pacquiao - Brandon Rios* - When Pacquiao was suddenly knocked out cold by rival Marquez, Pacquiao prepares for a final run against the always tough and strong Brandon Rios. Fireworks will definitely go off here, a fitting way to end November and all the epic boxing fights September, October and November will have.

Muhammad Ali was six foot three

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmaHGY7BEog
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56dQ5Lm298

Muhammad Ali's weight is often over his back foot, the stance puts his hip behind his cross, his low hands tempt an opponent to throw shots at his seemingly exposed head, even when not quite in range. Offensively, he throws plenty of straight punches from a distance, and his chief knockout punch is the right straight- often thrown while moving backwards. Defensively, he emphasized footwork and distance primarily
His body is built for this: keeping someone at the end of a long straight punch as he dances out of their way on his long legs.

Mike Tyson, and regularly fought people half a foot taller than him. Here's some video, watch it as you read:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgS3kCv79I

Mike Tyson's weight is often over his front foot, the stance puts his hip behind his left hook, his hands provide a shield against an opponent's jab. Offensively, he was at his best when he overwhelmed his opponent with short, compact hooks and uppercuts from the inside. Defensively, he emphasized head movement primarily- often slipping to the side of an opponent's shot and using it as an opening to get him into close range- and a tight guard secondarily.

1349030351.0,10pxzu,5 Most Overrated Fighters in Boxing,youhavethenerve,45,13,41,"After writing the [5 Most Underrated Fighters in Boxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/10k15o/5_most_underrated_fighters_in_boxing/), I thought this would be an interesting challenge because there clearly are fighters more highly regarded than they deserve to be.

One thing before I start: I'm not putting Mayweather or Pacquiao on this list. In both cases

Without further ado

5. **Nathan Cleverly**. *The* worst champion in boxing today. This is in a division that includes Beibut Shumenov as a fellow champion. Why does he have a fanbase? Because he's a) Welsh and b) compared to Joe Calzaghe. Yet

4. **Alexander Povetkin**. Yeah, how is it that Povetkin goes life and death with a Marco Huck? It was Huck's first ever heavyweight fight. He came in at 209lbs to Povetkin's 230lbs. Yet, Povetkin won only because something was fishy with the scorecards. Okay — maybe this was an anomaly. Yet, last night, Povetkin fought a barely mobile Hasim Rahman and managed to get hit. How do you get hit by a man who has trouble getting down the stairs?

3. **Andre Dirrell**. If you listen to some fans, Dirrell has some talent, but his last win was against a guy currently rated 102 on Boxrec. I don't care how talented you are. If you haven't fought elite competition in 2 1/2 years, there's no way you're beating Andre Ward.

2. **Adrien Broner**. People are already trumpeting Broner as the next Floyd Mayweather, he completely blew off making weight — rendering the results of the fight suspect. The only time he's fought a top 5 man in his division was against Daniel Ponce de Leon, a fight in which not only was he thoroughly outboxed, but was gifted a decision. (Sidenote: if you want to know how to beat the Philly Shell, watch Broner's fight against Ponce de Leon). So why is Broner not #1 on this list? Because he's fighting Antonio DeMarco in November. If he wins that fight, my hat goes off to him.

1. **Canelo Alvarez**. Alvarez is the WBC titlist for 154lbs. Yet, his last fight was against a guy who is a natural *Jr. Welterweight*. If he's primarily fighting Welterweights, why is he being ranked so highly as a Jr. Middleweight? I don't know. What I do know is, there's only two semi-elite Jr. Middleweight's he's beaten legitimately: old and faded Kermit Cintron, and old and faded Ryan Rhodes. Of the two, Rhodes truly was Alvarez' best win. Is that win good enough to justify Canelo's hype? I don't think so. But maybe it will be if Canelo ever has the cojones to fight Erislandy Lara, Carlos Molina, Cornelius Bundrage

**History: Julio Cesar Chavez and the Puerto Ricans of His Era**

Standing at not-threatening 1.71 meter, and knocking it down. 

A very capable fighter to say the least. 

Julio Cesar Chavez, he faced many mediocre opponents. 

The first Puerto Rican Fighter Julio Cesar Chavez

Many of these early fights of the Mexican Warrior usually ended by knockout, he would simply absorb all his opponent's punches and simply increase the pressure. 

Out boxing him wasn't easy either, as he slowed you down with his painful body shots that simply weren't human. 

Julio Cesar Chavez at 43-0 was an underdog against 33-1-2 Mario Martinez, some expected the untested Chavez to be outclassed by the Martinez, but these doubters and critics of Chavez's record were proven wrong as he defeated Martinez by technical decision in the eighth round, proving he was a truly skilled fighter.

Chavez was improving every fight he went through and to top it off

Ironically

A fighter holding a record of 53-0 against one which was...27-6. The fighter at 27-6 was the same fighter whose first title shot was against Wilfredo Gomez

Juan Laporte was not expected win. 

The Puerto Rican Fighter, still young still hadn't reached his prime, his toughest bout. 

It was an all-out war between a Mexican Fighter and Puerto Rican Fighter

Chavez as the bout continued would slow down Laporte with his monstrous body shots, and somehow Laporte refused to fall down as he continued his attempt to break the perfect record of 53-0. 

In the end of the bout, Chavez more confident and energetic as he had taken the last few rounds, Laporte looking battered yet still seemed confident. 

It's a bout that seemed at the time it could head both-ways

But in the end

Chavez would later move up to Lightweight were he encounter another Puerto Rican Fighter who stood at a near-dominant position in the Lightweight Division.  

Enter Edwin Rosario, a fighter that somehow stayed increasingly competitive in all his bouts. Even when past his best, he somehow nearly defeated Hector Camacho, practically ruining the flashy Puerto Rican with a single power punch that made Camacho change his whole style. 

Chavez was coming up his date

Though Chavez was considered a favorite questions lingered. How would Chavez, a fan-favorite along with Hector Camacho to defeat and avenge the controversial loss of Juan Laporte, and people all around Mexico similarly tuned-in to see the rising Mexican Star who had gained the support of his people.

It was supposed to be an exciting and competitive bout between the two Latinos

Julio Cesar Chavez entered his prime in his 57th bout. Rosario

Not just Mexico

Chavez later gained another title at the division as he continued to win and defeat contenders at Lightweight

But there were more challenges at Light Welterweight, with the referee stopping the fight, in a fight that would later earn Fight of the Decade Honor, Julio Cesar Chavez gained the respect of the Boxing World. Or their ire at the controversial stoppage of Meldrick Taylor.

Ire or respect

Nor did the view of the flamboyant Hector Camacho.

Hector Camacho had defeated Mexican Rafael Limons and Mexican Jose Luis Ramirez with his blazing speed and movement. His wild acts outside and inside the ring captured many people's attention. 

And he had not lost to a Mexican like Chavez had not lost to a Puerto Rican. 

It is to be noted, with a small record of 39-1, were not in their primes when they fought. Though Chavez had clearly aged better than most fighters, still good enough to be considered one of the best in the world, Camacho had not. 

In his win over Puerto Rican Rival Rosario, on the contrary to his offensive style which he would make his opponents fold due to the pressure of his speed.

This would one of the first few Mexican-Puerto Rican Fights labeled as a...well

In the build-up to the fight, Chavez in response due to superstition, hired another witch and countered Camacho's curse by wearing a red bandanna to the fight. The trash-talking Camacho quickly got on the nerves of Chavez, both almost attacking each other in the press conference. Chavez, angered, promise over, and over, swearing he would knockout Camacho.

And with shades of Rosario-Chavez, and even held back by Camacho's own defensive style which he had now adopted. 

And in the end

Yet Camacho raised his hands in victory

Because Chavez didn't knock him out

In the end, in which many believed Whitaker should have won. He would also lose a decision against Frankie Randall.

Yet in the end

And in the end he was never defeated by a Puerto Rican Fighter.

The era of the late 80's and early 90's slowly began to fade

New fighters began to rise.

Enter Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya.

**The Fourth Best Mexican Fighter of All Time**

**Salvador Sanchez**- This will definitely have one or two eyebrows raised. Salvador Sanchez was 23 when he died in a tragic accident. Yet his record does not need words to describe. Wins over Juan Laporte, 47-1 Ruben Castillo, 43-1 Roberto Castanon, Azumah Nelson and many others. With a record of 44-1, 32 of those wins by way of knockout, his relentless pressure and incredible chin could have possibly led this 23 year old to be the greatest Featherweight Fighter of All Time.

**The Fourth Best Puerto Rican Fighter of All Time**

This will not go without controversy.



**Felix Trinidad**

Felix Trinidad Jr debuted at 17 and having an incredible career, well, godly, he knocked people who've never been knocked down with no problems. He would face people known to have chins as hard as granite, yet with a few punches he knock them down to the point where they had nothing left. 

He has wins over Hector Camacho, Oba Carr, Pernell Whitaker, William Joppy, Ricardo Mayorga, a trademark win over Fernando Vargas, and a controversial victory over Oscar De La Hoya.

**When is it?** Nov 12

**Where is it?** MGM Grand - Las Vegas

**What's the big deal?** This is the third fight in what will probably be seen as the defining boxing trilogy of our generation. In the first fight

This fight is supposed to be the one that ""settles questions""

**What about the undercard?** Because most people who are tuning in are casual fans who just want to see Manny, and serves as a comeback of sorts (though he's undefeated with a 27-0 record). 

If Bradley wins with flying colors

**Predictions** While Marquez has unquestionably figured out Pacquiao's style, he'll be fighting at Welterweight. The last time he fought at this division -- when he fought Mayweather -- he looked sluggish and slow. On top of this, Marquez is 38-years-old and is nearing the end of this career. Pacquiao will probably win by late round TKO.

Regarding Bradley-Casamayor

**Should I buy this fight?** Buying Pacquiao-Marquez III is pretty much like watching Return of the Jedi. If you don't watch the previous episodes

When did you start boxing?

When I was 10 or 11. When my mom divorced my dad, where I lived with Juan Keller, a greengrocer who wanted to host boxers. He treated me like his son. It was in that house where I also met Marcos Maidana.

How (did you meet him/did this happen)?

- We helped Keller with his greengrocery shop. We used to go get vegetables in the truck, then we would fight in the sports clubs (of the towns). By that time, I had already fought professionally in Rafaela, but with another name, because I was a minor (less than 16 years old), and they wouldn't give me a license. My name was José Acebal. It was crazy, cuz I had a tattoo on my chest that said ""Lucas"". That year, I packed my bag without looking back and traveled to Buenos Aires.

What did you pack everytime you left?

The very little things I had. A picture of my family, as a present. Those are unforgettable memories. 

How was life at the Cenard (the national team barracks)?

It was complicated, hiding unnoticed. She was the mom for everyone there, everyone would tell her how they felt. The team would ask for extra rations so that we could give them to my mom, and little by little, we filled her plate. 

Do you still have that close relationship with your mom?

Yeah, I sleep next to her. She's my mom, and I love her: I thank her that she's always with me. 

How was it living with Marcos Maidana?

Very quiet, since we were kids, and we respect each other. When people say that they want to see us in the ring, I say that I don't have a problem, that if we have to fight, we'll fight. But there are so many others to fight, why do they have to bust my balls with trying to make us fight? We fought in the amateurs. He beat me 3 times, I know how hard he hits

Is he the one that hit you the hardest (ever)?

No. It was Humberto ""La Zorrita"" Soto the one who made me feel his hand the most. But I think I have a good chin

Have you ever thought about leaving boxing?

Yeah, same thing. But my daughter, Priscilla told me: ""Dad, keep going, because you fight well"". And I kept going because she requested it.

If you hadn't done that

Probably a carpenter. When I was a kid, though. I learned how to make them when I was in the national team. If you ever look at Maidana's first tattoo, it's in his back, and I made it for him. 

What happens if you beat Danny Garcia ...?

(Interrupts) i WILL beat him.

Ok

I'm still going to be the same. Maybe it'll get tougher in my everyday life. My career will change, the champion"" I don't go there anymore. Or if I go to the store, and they tell me ""Just take it free of charge, champ"", I feel bad. I work, just like everybody. I like paying for myself, I don't like gifts. I like it when people call me Lucas, but on the ground

How are you at home? What do you do at home?

I'm quiet, I watch many documentaries of animals or aliens. I like war movies, but horror movies scare me a little bit, haha. If there are things on tv that don't impress me, I just change the channel. 

Ha!

Hahaha, because my daughter's future my family's and my team's is in jeopardy. But when I come down, I'm like a puppy.

Carlos Monzon used to say that his opponents were thieves that came to steal his sons' bread and that's why he hated them so much.

When they tell me to go in that ring, I watch the videos of what I do in the fight, and when I look at what I do in the ring, I get scared of myself. I get scared of how forward I am and how I hit.

Talking about fear

His face changed. More than one person that night came to see me lose. And Garcia was one of them. Before the fight, and he looked as pale as a ghost. If I was in his place, my ass would be full of questions and doubt. Because if I go see a future rival, and he knocks someone out like I did it, I'd be as worried as he looked.

The new scoring system is a 10 point must system.

*There are 5 judges sitting around the ring.  3 judges are randomly chosen to go ""live"" and their cards score the bout.  The judges won't know if they are live.

*10-9 (close round)  *10-8 (clear winner in the round)  *10-7 (the boxer is outclassed)  *10-6 (this should never happen)

*The judges must chose a winner.  There are no ties.  In the event of a tie b/c of points off, generalship, etc.

## Devon Alexander vs. Lee Purdy
***Round 1:*** Alexander strikes first with body shots. Purdy is biding his time, Purdy comes close and rips his own body shots. Compared to Alexander's body shots, though, they're insignificant. Finally, Purdy taps Alexander's chin. They both exchange. Looks like a fight might actually break out. Alexander then bangs Purdy with the uppercut right at the bell!

*10-9 Alexander*

***Round 2:*** Alexander continues to pick his shots well. Great body shots. Purdy keeps moving forward

*10-9 Alexander

***Round 3:*** Alexander is just banging him up. I don't think Alexander will KO Purdy, but Alexander replies with his own. Looks like some swelling under Alexander's eye. Maybe that will make this fight more interesting.

*10-9 Alexander

***Round 4:*** Purdy gets in one uppercut. But though he got in an uppercut, Purdy looks to me like a walking meat rack.

*10-9 Alexander

***Round 5:*** Purdy got in some nice, but not enough to win it.

*10-9 Alexander

***Round 6:*** You know, it seems, of being KOed. He just keeps on moving forward even though Alexander is throwing the kitchen sink at him. Note: Alexander's left hand *may* be injured.

*10-9 Alexander

***Round 7:*** Yep

*10-9 Alexander

**Official Results** Alexander RTD7 Purdy. Purdy's corner stops the fight.

## Lamont Peterson vs. Lucas Martin Matthysse 
***Round 1:*** Peterson actually staying on the outside. Matthysse, trying to make Matthysse miss. Two solid punches by Matthysse get in near the bell, with a solid headshot landing *at* the bell!

*10-9 Matthysse*

***Round 2:*** Matthysse trying to bring in pressure

*10-8 Matthysse

***Round 3:*** Matthysse swings for the fences

-When you throw a combo like a basic 1-2

-Learn to slip at the same time as you punch on occasion. If you can throw a double jab while slipping during the second

-If you fight someone whose stance is opposite yours

-RUN ON DAYS OFF. 'Nuff said.

-Think of your opponent as having crosshairs on his head or body. As my trainer says ""think like a sniper."" If he moves left, or you'll open yourself up to attack, and will never get off powerful punches.

-Something not enough fighters do, move right, move out, just move somewhere! Sometimes, even if you can throw a combo, move out (instead of slipping or bob and weave), then come right back in and throw another punch or combo

-SHADOW BOX. Just like any other sport, you're doing yourself a huge disservice. I've even started rolling back and forth while I'm alone at my desk to practice movement, It's helped a lot.

1323413946.0,n5zt2,PREVIEW: Amir Khan vs. Lamont Peterson,youhavethenerve,29,0,20,"**When is it?** Dec 10

**Where is it?** Convention Center - Washington

**TV Network/Show** HBO - World Championship Boxing

**What's the big deal?** I'll be blunt: I'm a *huge* Khan fan. He's got the complete package of skill, and heart. Everything that is great in a fighter can be found in Khan.

But what makes me a fan is he's got a flaw -- Amir Khan is *vulnerable*. As shown in his 2008 fight against Breidis Prescott

Since 2008, apart from a few rounds last year, Khan's been unstoppable.

Khan has stopped a parade of notable names since 2008: Marco Antonio Barrera, Marcos Maidana, Zab Judah. He is now arguably the best Jr. Welterweight in the world -- and on the cusp of worldwide superstardom (he already *is* a superstar in Great Britain).

Which brings us to Lamont Peterson. He's no slouch himself, and gave Willy Blain his first defeat. In fact, Peterson's only defeat was against Timothy Bradley -- there is no shame in that.

Still

* Khan does his best work on the outside. However

* Khan has been able to use his height advantage to dominate his opposition. Peterson only gives up 1"" in height.

* Khan wins fights due to high volume punches and speed. Peterson

Peterson doesn't need to be convincing to win, doesn't mean judges won't gift those belts to Peterson.

The only way Khan is going to leave D.C. with his belts is if he either knocks Peterson out

**What about the undercard?** I'm actually more excited about the undercard than the main event. It's a heavyweight bout. Seth Mitchell is battling Timur Ibragimov. 

We haven't had an exciting American heavyweight in years -- but we *might* have one in Seth Mitchell. The only way we'll know for certain

Mitchell has compiled an undefeated 23-0-1 record -- with eight of his last fights ending by KO. He's fast, he's the kind of heavyweight people like to watch.

Ibragimov, Tony Thompson, and Calvin Brock. If you're not an elite boxer, you're probably going to lose against Ibragimov. This is why he's such a good test against Mitchell.

So is Mitchell the real deal? I sure *hope* so. If Mitchell's not

**Predictions** Khan will need to close the deal. From the moment the bell rings, perhaps attempting to tag Khan's chin.

The difference maker though will be speed. Khan has that *much* more speed than Peterson -- this will result is a late stoppage for Khan. **TKO10 Khan**

As for Mitchell-Ibragimov, Mitchell weighs 20lbs more than Ibragimov. Unlike most heavyweights, Mitchell's mass is due to muscle -- not fat. 

Because of Mitchell's size and chiseled physique

**Rating** B. Khan should win. Mitchell should win. The only thing that is questionable is whether Peterson could make this close -- enough for him to steal Khan's belts via hometown robbery.",,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/n5zt2/preview_amir_khan_vs_lamont_peterson/

He has a LOT of weight to loose to even get close to the 165 catchweight he's contracted for by 9/7/13.

*And* he's no longer going to have Freddie in his corner?  I wonder if he'll be w/Nacho Beristain or if he's going to have some cat he can tell what to do and end up coming in way under-trained.

A phrase similarly uttered and heard countless times by boxing fans both diehard and casual. But what does this soundbyte **really** mean? Ask the average 18-25 year old male, they want blood.

Or, or my boxing coach who went ten rounds with Floyd Mayweather. Do this and you'll hear that boxing isn't what it used to be. ""There's no fire"" they'll say, ""they aren't hungry anymore"".

And while I don't think boxing is dying, not in ppv sales or gate numbers, but instead in what the two men represented.

                                                     Old vs New

You all know the score; Malignaggi came up hard against real champions like a 140lb Miguel Cotto. Plagued by hand injuries and a serious lack of power made him far from a betting favourite, Paulie has never shown anything but support for his fellow Brooklynites, and the local boxing scene. All in all, it's safe to say that he's a stand up guy.

His opponent across the ring last night represented the other side of the coin. Broner has everything a young fighter could dream of. Hand speed, a great team, three belts, and Golden Boy in his corner. In the ring he is a pleasure to watch, unfortunately Adrien doesn't live in Barclay's arena.  He gets in trouble with the law, he acts like a fool on t.v, and he makes the trash-talk too personal. He didn't have to fight the kind of opposition Paulie did, but his fans don't know that. 

I could be overreacting, the flagrant fouls in the ring, the shout outs to Worldstarhiphop. I don't want this to be way boxing is, I don't want up and coming fighter's to act like Adrien Broner. I want to go back to the old way.

But the old way didn't prevail last night, that way is here to stay as well. People don't take dangerous fights anymore, Manny and Floyd showed us that. Going life and death is a thing of the past, like the 15 rounder, or the American Heavyweight. This is the way things are done now, kids don’t want to grow up to be like Paulie, they want to be like Broner.  “You never got me down ray” words spoken by the great Jake LaMotta. A harkening to a day when it was more about how much you could take, it doesn't get you laid

Seth Mitchell was on the verge of being knocked out every time Banks let his hands go, but perhaps we aren't so far removed form the days of Sonny Liston after all, where back room deals and shady happenings decide the future of a fighter who wants nothing more than to fight. Sure we have more commissions now, but just like Commissioner Gordon said: ""we get body armor, they get armor piercing rounds"". More and more fighters sign with Golden Boy and Al Haymon everyday, you can't win a decision against an Al Haymon fighter, and a loss in boxing can ruin a career. So why not sign with him

I have a feeling the tectonics is boxing shifted visibly last night. I’ve been called a romantic, and Al Haymon, are the future, and I’m sad for it.

1369204363.0,1etjj9,How my first time watching a boxing fight was live at Boardwalk Hall - Lamont Peterson vs. Lucas Matthysse . One word: Amazing.,goosefrings,32,3,21,"Hi everyone! a while ago I posted about what kind of things you guys recommend me to do at my first boxing fight watching it live. Needless to say, not too far not too close. It would have been a nicer if we were closer though. 

Then, for some reason I felt so fucking sad for Medellin because he got KO'ed in the first rounds within the first 50 seconds or so. I just felt so sad for him I started cheering for him to get up and stuff, I have no idea why, I have no connection to the fighter and he wasn't my favorite, I just felt bad for the dude. I also felt disgusted and enraged at Haroon Khan for picking on such a little guy, but yeah I understand they're both the same weight and he's a prospect so he needed this fight, whatever. Anyway, my dad said he liked how Porter move, who knows.

By now, I could have given a less of a shit about Alexander, all I was waiting for was for the entry of my fellow countryman, Lucas the Machine Matthysse. 

So it's about that time of the main event, and my mom goes like: That's Lucas!!! so I go with my argentinean flag and say Lucas, you'll KO him (Peterson) in 10 let's go baby!!!(all in Spanish) and he points his glove at me and his trainer gives me a thumbs up. I felt like dying. It was awesome. So he makes his way in, and the Showtime cameras are all on me because I have this Argentinean flag and I am suddenly on TV! i was on showtime right after they announce ""Lucas La Maquina Argentina Matthysse"". so that was really cool. After Lucas TKO's LP, I go right to the ringside i'm like 10 steps away from this dude, and Lucas comes to the cheering Argentinean crowd and I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM!!! I got to touch Matthysse's back and I was like: Man you did a great job! Let's get Garcia next! and he goes like: Yeah, hopefully if they make it happen. Then, as she was wearing this argentinean jersey. 

Then I did something pretty stupid, I yell: YO, GARCIA. And I swear to god, he looks back at me and I go like: YOU'RE NEXT and I point at Lucas while doing the ""you're dead"" hand sign (thumb cutting my neck). Garcia gave me a super frightening look and then he mumbled something to his dad, and now both Angel and Danny were looking at me with some black guy next to them. I became completely horrified cuz I thought they were going to whoop my ass and just stab me right there and then I dont' know why I thought that.But my dad later pointed out that i should have chilled out and just not say that at all, to which I agreed. 

Last, and I went like: Yo Peter! Broner's next baby, trust me on this one! to which he started laughing. He seemed like a nice guy, I like him. I also like Paulie better than Broner, but I doubt he'll beat him.

## Keith Thurman vs. Jan Zaveck
***Round 1:*** Both fighters are feeling each other out. Thurman's purposely hitting the guard to see if it holds — it does. Zaveck hits Thurman with an overhand
Zaveck gets in. Thurman then catches Zaveck when he tries a right hook. This is a close round

10-9 Thurman

***Round 2:*** Thurman pumping the jab effectively. Then Zaveck rushes Thurman

10-9 Thurman

***Round 3:*** Thurman's clearly found that Zaveck doesn't like the outside. So he's hitting him with jabs and crosses. Zaveck is biding his time

10-9 Thurman

***Round 4:*** Thurman continues to target the body. Zaveck's got a whole lot of heart. But Zaveck every so often crowds Thurman and tries to bully him by the ropes. Now Thurman is loading up with combos that first go to the body

10-9 Thurman

***Round 5:*** Man

10-9 Thurman

***Round 6:*** Good counter left by Zaveck momentarily knocks Thurman off-balance. This seems to encourage him with some tremendous left hooks. Well, both trade.

10-9 Zaveck

***Round 7:*** Hard right hook by connects cleanly on Thurman! Thurman seems unhurt and continues to throw at Zaveck. Thurman then rocks Zaveck with a left! He follows this up with a body shot and uppercut! Zaveck not letting up

10-9 Zaveck

***Round 8:*** Looks like both men are tired. Thurman has less pepper in his shots, and I don't want to make it seems like he doesn't have an argument, but I like how Zaveck continues his aggression.

10-9 Zaveck

***Round 9:*** Thurman's now having to box like he's never boxed before. Zaveck might last the distance. As it is

10-9 Thurman

***Round 10:*** Zaveck's now going to the body. He's also continuing to find success with the overhand right. Thurman's now countering him with left body shots. Thurman's hooks now causing Zaveck to stumble! His left eye is opening up! Thurman tries again with the hook

10-9 Thurman

***Round 11:*** Zaveck is really tentative this round. He's neither bullying Thurman, Zaveck goes to the body, but there's no pepper on them. Uppercut by Thurman looks falshy, but they were glancing. Thurman won this on the jab.

10-9 Thurman

***Round 12:*** Zaveck now back to pressuring, but Thurman responds with the right. Zaveck showing heart. He's not letting Zaveck off the hook. Overhand right lands on Thurman cleanly, but I still give this to Thurman.

10-9 Thurman

**Official Results** Scores: 120-108

## Bernard Hopkins vs. Tavoris Cloud

***Round 1:*** Doesn't look like Cloud plans to overpower Dawson. Dawson' so far, and is able to sneak in some punches. Let's see if Hopkins is able to repeat this with the next rounds.

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 2:*** Love Hopkins defense. He knows just the distance for where to walk in. Cloud tries to punch, and then makes Cloud pay. Closer round, but still Hopkins for me.

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 3:*** Hopkins now attempting to make this an inside fight, but Hopkins just sophicates them, then follows with a hook to the head. Good exchange at the bell.

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 4:*** Cloud tries with a right to the head

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 5:*** Cloud tried to corner Hopkins, but Hopkins is disrupting his timing.

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 6:*** Hopkins maneuvers Cloud to the ropes

10-9 Hopkins

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 8:*** So far

10-9 Cloud

***Round 9:*** A right by Cloud just connects with Hopkins. But Hopkins responds with two to the body. A hook by Hopkins gets in. Cloud tries to counter

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 10:*** Left-right catches Cloud at the center of the ring. Hopkins follows this again with a combo to the head! Love how Hopkins just makes himself unpredictable. Cloud's trying again with the jab

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 11:*** Hopkins just knows how to pop the jab in an unpredictable manner. Cloud then tries to corner Hopkins at the ropes

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 12:*** Left-right by Hopkins thuds at the center of the ring! Cloud tries to go to the body

10-9 Hopkins

###Andre Berto 28(22)-2 vs Jesus Soto Karass 27(17)-8-3
### Pre-fight rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
### vacant NABF welterweight title
### 12 Rounds

This fight is as much about Virgil Hunter as it is about Andre Berto. If Berto wins here and does so in a way that has us forget about his directionless fighting in the past few years we could be hailing Virgil Hunter as a real fight whisperer. And that’s not because he whispers in the corner. This is Berto’s first fight with new trainer Virgil Hunter. Hunter, he came out using the half-guard defense against Robert Guerrero who mauled him and bulldozed his way right through it. The result was Berto dropped twice in the first 2 rounds and losing a decision. Once again, Berto was left in the dark while the victor went on to a career payday against Floyd Mayweather Jr. 

Berto at one point was being promoted as a tiny Tyson. He has one of the most vicious uppercuts in boxing right now. When he lands that punch, but rather because of the ferocity behind it. Berto, like Gamboa, also carries a lot of bulk muscle to the ring which may be cause of his poor stamina. 

Jesus Soto Karass has the distinction of being one of the best pound-for-pound fighters out there with an ugly record. Karass, it could be argued that it was called a little too early. His last fight out was against Selcuk Aydin, 23-1 at the time. That was on the undercard of Matthysse-Dallas Jr card this past January.. Karass is an adaptable fighter who’s style varies from fight to fight. He’s not the most technical, but he does what he needs to win. He’s got losses to Maidana, Gabriel Rosado (Karass moved up to 154 for the fight), Mike Jones twice, Alfonso Gomez
Expect to see a slugfest. Both fighters have been in highly competitive and entertaining brawls. Berto with both Ortiz and Guerrero and Karass with Maidana. 

Here’s an interesting statistic that I got from @shostats: Berto’s recent opponents landed 42% of power punches, and once against Cosme Rivera. Karass has been stopped twice by Maidana and Rosado. In my research, Maidana is the only one on record to have dropped him. I don’t expect a knockout here. It’s certainly possible given their records, but unlikely their hearts we’ve seen in the past.

The welterweight division is stacked. Here are the notable welterweights: Floyd Mayweather Jr, Timothy Bradley*, Devon Alexander, Adrien Broner, Robert Guerrero, Amir Khan, Kell Brook, Luis Carlos Abregu*, Josesito Lopez

*Top Rank fighters

*My prediction: Berto TKO9*

***

### Keith Thurman 20(18)-0 vs Diego Gabriel Chaves 22(18)-0
### Pre-fight rating: ★ ★ ★ 
### interim WBA World welterweight title
### 12 Rounds

Keith “One Time” Thurman is the reigning prospect of the year. In March he fought Jan Zaveck who previously was stopped by Andre Berto due to swelling. He won a 12 round decision where all three judges scorecards ruled it 12 rounds to none. In the fight

On the other side however, Argentina. These Argentines are rugged and recently on a roll with Sergio Martinez, Lucas Matthysse, Marcos Maidana, and Luis Carlos Abregu leading the way. His career as an amateur was not particularly outstanding. He was shut out in one fight against Demetrius Andrade 22-0. It appears that his style has adjusted well since turning pro. This is going to be his second fight outside of Argentina and only the first time outside his homeland since 2010. He has not gone 12 rounds since 2011, with every fight since then ending in an early stoppage in his favor. He’s been dropped twice in his career. The first time was in his 10th fight. He was knocked down in the second fight and went on to win a unanimous decision.  In 2011 he was also dropped and went on to win a unanimous decision as well. 

Thurman should be favored in this fight. You gotta think Golden Boy wouldn’t put the prospect of the year in with a fighter they know could derail everything… but Chaves has a similar record with the same amount of KO’s. Thurman has steadily been improving with each fight and possess raw power we’ve seen

*My prediction: Thurman UD*

1316696688.0,knuva,Just wanted to share some (9)experiences/things I've learned from my latest sparring match. ,mybrotherwasrad,32,4,31,"Well

Well in no particular order

1) Cardio. Mother fucking never get enough of it cardio. Don't just do sprints, Non-ox Glycosis, Ox Glycosis.) I took some real body shots today, by (arguably) the strongest hitter in my gym. The road under my feet was plenty this time around, and I was able to get my wind back.

2) Head movement motherfuckers, and then BAM, I got rocked. My slip bag helped A LOT though. 

3) Distance and timing. After reviewing a lot of great fighters, and tonight I was a completely different fighter. My footwork has always been great, but today, I turned into a beast. 

4) My gas mask training doesn't simulate HAT. The science has proved that for a while. But anyone try Tabata's in mask, and could recover. Your mentality, your heart, needs training just like your body. 

5) Tabata's are KILLER, recover, and burst like a beast. 

6) Weights are great. Look up (not to endorse) but Ross Enamait, or Convict Conditioning. Hell CrossFit wouldn't hurt either. Pick your poison and integrate it as your General Physical Preparation. 

7) Recovery and diet is very important too. Just like any physical activity, look into foam rolling. It's made a huge difference in my performance. Diet wise, I've learned a lot studying for my personal training classes, but the tl;dr version is eat healthy and maintain your calories and nutrients. 

8) Don't practice stupid fucking things you see on t.v. or in movies. My opponent tried a bolo today

9) Cardio. Learn to love it, work more than just your legs. Figure out how to breathe, and break through the wall. 

Anyway

1316439368.0,kkgf1,Mayweather - Ortiz: Aftermath,ricardotown,41,16,71,"	
	“Worst Fight Ever.”  “Boxing is dead.”  “I’ll never buy a PPV again.”

But our subreddit
Love him or hate him, and dollars in the bank.	

On Sept. 17th, for intentional headbutting, Victor Ortiz walked from his neutral corner at Cortez’s request, and began to initiate a conversation with Mayweather.  With a gestured huddle, and gently touched gloves, Ortiz began to apologize to Mayweather.  Playing along, Mayweather held out both hands in an amicable gesture, once again solidifying the Hall-of-Fame merits of the often critiqued third man.  Cortez turned around just in time to see Mayweather unload his laser-like right hand directly into Ortiz’s confused, which Ortiz was unable to answer.

Since then, there’s a lot to discuss.

So, and in his slurred speech and feeble hand gestures, he insinuated the the fighters might want to begin fighting again, if they feel so inclined, with a quiet “Let’s go,” and a gentle wave of his hands.  It is at this point, when the fighters are removed from the neutral corners and instructed to fight again, it is almost impossible to argue the legality of Mayweather’s finishing blows.  What is not impossible to argue against is the nature with which Cortez commanded the fight.  In a relatively cut-and-dry scenario in boxing

Outside of legitimacy, does not deserve the scorn with which it’s been met by many boxing fans (or ex-fans, if message board comments are to be believed).  

While we always like a competitive fight, and overall heart, but we sometimes forget the crucial significance of mental sharpness and toughness.  I love the quote by Jack Dempsey, “All the time he was thinking, I was hitting him,” but it belies the degree to which mentality shapes a fight’s outcome and a fighter’s success.  In the ring, Mayweather is as sharp and tough as they come.  And if there was one thing we were concerned about with Victor Ortiz ever since his surrender to Maidana

Ortiz' greatest weakness as a fighter was his callow, Oliver McCall began to have a mental breakdown in the ring, often dropping his hands, turning away, and openly crying, but Lennox Lewis did not stop throwing punches.  And this didn’t surprise anyone!  It was the middle of a championship boxing match!  Why should he hold back?

Think about it this way: if Mayweather hadn't knocked out Ortiz

How do I know this? Because it's exactly what happened to Mosley when he fought Mayweather. The ref broke up a clinch, giving Mayweather all the time he needed to stuff a right hand in Mosley’s face.

Did he do this because he's a jerk? Yeah, relies on its barbarism and brutality just as much as its finesse and skill. The name of the game is ""hit and not get hit."" It's ""get off first."" And, unfortunately for Ortiz, it's ""Protect yourself at all times, and come out fighting.""  

It was inexperience that felled Ortiz as much as it was Mayweather’s right hand.

As for the future health of boxing, many writers and experts commented on how Floyd Mayweather’s “bad boy” persona is working against him, limiting him from being the true, breakout star that his skills would enable him to be.  If only they could see him now. (They can.)

Mayweather, having regularly sold to millions of households since his appearance against the unanimaously loved Oscar De la Hoya.  Since then, he’s been brash, arrogant, and downright rude in all pre-fight buildup, and it has always delivered.  This time it was no different.

So when casual sports fans and boxing fans alike declare their hatred for Mayweather, continue to act as a constant in a formula that has been consistently working in Mayweather’s favor.  They hate him.  Their families probably hate him, too.  And they’ll all be there, whether they like it or not, to see the next guy attempt to knock him off his tower.

Looking at the Victor Ortiz, he showed that he can look at a loss as just that, a loss.  Not the end of a career.  His smile, tinged with disappointment after the fight, showed us his spirits were still high after such a high profile loss, a far cry from the behavior he displayed after the Maidana debacle.  In the end he can at least hold his head high knowing that he was outsmarted, but not outfought.  

Ortiz will likely hold a title again in the near future.  Would anyone be stupid enough to say no to Berto-Ortiz II for Berto’s new belt? 

With regards to the decrees of “Worst Fight Ever, for the first time in years, the a fight’s outcome as set ablaze the sports community.  Hearkening back to Tyson-Holyfield II, the infamous “Bite Fight,” everyone remotely interested in boxing are discussing the seemingly controversial nature of the fight’s conclusion.  And with more people talking, there will be more people hating Mayweather.  And with more people hating Mayweather, there will be that many more people tuning in to see the fight that we thought couldn’t possibly get any bigger.  


Let’s hope Pacquiao protects himself.

12 Rounds

Marcos Rene Maidana 33(30)-3 vs. Josesito Lopez 30(18)-5-1

There isn't much to be said about these guys other than the fact that they leave it all in the ring. They aren't savvy ring generals like Erislandy Lara who will fight before them. They are guys that go to the center and will out a victory using grit and heart. They have both been down in fights. Lopez has 1 loss out of his 5 that was by way of TKO. Maidana has lost 3 times in his career. His loss to Devon Alexander can be argued as the only legitimate loss on his record. Kotelnik was a fight in German that was a split decison. Khan managed to get by with the help of Joe Cortez and al dente legs. Maidana has recently begun taking boxing lessons and flaunted them early in the Soto Kartass fight. That fight was also on pace to have the lowest score total in a 12 round fight ever, these are some dirty fucking fighters.""

All in all

My prediction: Maidana TKO 9



**Prefight Rating:** 3 STARS
interim WBA World light middleweight title
12 Rounds

Erislandy Lara 17(11)-1-2 vs. Alfredo Angulo 22(18)-2

Erislandy should very well be an undefeated fighter. He's got pure talent that seems to be in the water of Guantanamo, and Al Bennett are still at large and yet to be detained. 

That doesn't explain Lara's 2 draws so I'll attempt to do that. Lara is a defense first fighter who fights off the back foot and would rather be a ring general than take a risk. Thus, but he clearly lost) and to James ""Houdini"" Kirkland. The first round against Kirkland was an absolute heart-pounding thriller and I predict we won't be seeing that tonight. Not with Virgil Hunter in Angulo's corner. 

My prediction: Lara UD

Expect both fighters to fight a disciplined boxing match.

My prediction: Charlo by UD.

It opened at
WILL GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **+165**
WON'T GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **-210**


I thought this was freaking crazy


Checked yesterday and the current lines are
WILL GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **-350**
WON'T GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **+250**


It completely flipped big time.  Now this is either due to a huge error on MGM Grand's part


So I put $75 on WON'T Go 10 Full rounds.  This will allow me to win $90 no matter the outcome(except for DQ/NC then I get all my money back).


I anticipate the sports book is going to lose a lotttt of money on this since they created the greatest Arbitrage and I am sure some professional gamblers caught it when it was +165


I've never seen this happen.  I just wish I put more money on the +165

But having a UFC in boxing is worthless since that organization is a regional (yet popular) sanctioning organization. 

Boxing is an international sport with deep international talent. World champions are produced from Brooklyn, to [Bukom, Ghana](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21180321). It is one of the most followed international sports on the globe. Surely, there is *another* way to accommodate its global talent *and* its global fanbase while addressing global matters of controversy.

This post will address ideas I have regarding controversy. But first

* **There is disagreement on the results.** Example: every Pacquiao-Marquez fight except IV.
* **The officials displayed gross incompetence.** Example: Mares-Agbeko I. In this fight
* **There’s clear organized corruption.** Example: Williams-Botha. In this fight

**Disagreement on Results**

Regarding disagreement of results, sometimes it looks like a fighter has won by a wide margin, but when you leave the results in the hands of judges, anything can happen. 

So why don’t we scrap the current judging system? Believe me

Due to Roy Jones Jr.‘s infamous loss in the 1988 Olympics

Even worse, [AIBA is now switching to the 10-point scoring system used in the pros](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120809/oly-box-aiba-scoring-system/).

Clearly

Retired referee Joe Cortez has a simple solution: [elevate the judges from ringside allowing them a clearer view of what’s happening during the fight](http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/175657-from-the-pages-of-the-ring-magazine-a-new-perspective). According to Cortez, and bright lights, will no longer be a hindrance for judging. 

Could this work? Absolutely. I don’t think most judges who score a fight do so with the intent to rob a fighter’s good efforts.

**The officials displayed gross incompetence.** 

This occurs most often with officials who have little practical experience. The solution therefore is simple: don’t give fights carrying worldwide significance to refs that haven’t built their resume.

But in the case of Russell Mora

Simple. Every point deduction or disqualification should be reviewed by video replay. If it works in football, *then* deduct a point.

**There’s clear organized corruption.**

This can’t easily be helped because if there’s clear organization corruption

The good news for boxing is that there isn’t one singular organization that runs the sport. There are sanctioning bodies and commissions that are clearly corrupt — but there’s also ones that have integrity. 

The problem, he has no problem of moving the fight to a corrupt jurisdiction. Here, matters of PEDs and hometown decisions are swept under the rug. A good example of this is Texas — a state that has become infamous for controversy.

I therefore propose three solutions to this problem:

1. Scrap all regional / state commissions, drug testing, rankings under the scope of one national organization that governs the sport. Make this body one that is backed up by the US government.
2. To kill charges of bias, elite boxers are often titlists with the IBO before they’re titlists with the “major” sanctioning bodies.
3. I personally don’t like this proposal, the APB). This will allow professional boxers to perform under the jurisdiction of an organization that has international sway, while maintaining their Olympic eligibility. 

Regarding Proposal 3, most “prestigious” sanctioning bodies — any better? I think not.

One advantage the APB has that current alphabet organizations don’t have is that it has support from a countries wherein fighters who don’t often go pro can *easily* go pro. For instance

* British boxing has always been exciting to watch and today will be no different.  Kell Brook (Ring rated #4 welterweight) squares off against Carson Jones (six months younger than me...making me feel worthless).  Jones has 8 stoppages in his last 8 fights but has not been able to make it into the upper echelon of fighters.  Kell Brook seems to be a special talent coming out of the UK

* In British Heavyweight boxing, since Maddalone is still probably reeling from the extended beating he recieved from Tomasz Adamek in 2010.  Look for Fury to stop Maddalone in similar fashion.  Fury TKO5 Maddalone.

* Also across the way, IBF, WBO, WBA Heavyweight Champion of the World"" Wladimir Klitschko puts his titles on the line"" against  Tony ""The Tiger"" Thompson.  W. Klit beat Thompson in 2008 via TKO in the 11th, but Thompson didn't make it easy for Klitschko.  Thompson has come back with 5 stoppages against C+/B- level opposition since the loss.  Klitschko has a habit of doing better in rematches, so the pick here is Klitschko KO7 Thompson.

* Finally, quick boxers, and luckily for him, Rosinsky is *not* that.  Don't get me wrong Rosinsky had solid skills, and he's seemed to come into the fight in better shape than Pavlik, but Pavlik should have enough in his arsenal to overcome ""Power"".  I think Rosinsky will last the distance with Pavlik and Pavlik will walk away with a close decision win.  Pavlik UD10 Rosinsky.  

* On that same card, and with a 5.5 inch height advantage, he will be the tallest opponent Donaire has faced.  Donaire is believed by many to be top 5 P4P and should be too much for Mathebula to handle.  I see it being a tougher fight for Donaire with Donaire walking away with a close split decision win.

What do you guys think?  The action starts at 3pmEST with Kell Brook/Carson Jones so be sure to tune in to your favorite streams for a great day of fights.",,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/w6lw8/today_is_going_to_be_pretty_awesome_for_boxing/

We are back with another Throwback Thursday. In my absence I have traveled coast to coast in the United States on a business trip. Typically not exciting; however, one thing was a common theme and that is excitement about the upcoming Olympics. I have to confess I knew very little about the Olympic team but there is excitement brewing. So I promise to do some digging and maybe come up with a Reddit Cheat sheet for the upcoming games. In the interim, I decided to educate myself a little more on Olympic boxing, and in my search I discovered a real interesting character who never entered the professional scene, Teofilo Stevenson  

The olympic boxing world is largely different then the world of the prizefighting pugilist, and some that do excel at this level never make it through the riggers of the professional circuit, and some simply decided never to join. Perhaps the most skilled and amazing of those fighters the cuban Teofilo Stevens. Teofilo Stevens is perhaps the most skilled Cuban to have ever entered the olympics, which is an accomplishment considering the small island is second only to the United states in number of Gold Medals and total medals. Only three fighters in the world have managed to capture the gold three times one from Hungary, and the other Felix Savon, another Cuban. Teofilo Stevenson never got a chance to compete for his fourth, but if he had

Stevenson is perhaps most famous for one thing, a million dollars to face Ali for the belt. 

Stevenson did not take the money or the offer, so the only way for stevenson to take the deal would be for him to leave the country. I don’t think this was in anyway an attempt to get out of the fight either. Ali was 35 at the time and soon to lose to Leon Spinks. 

It wasn’t a case Stevenson being brainwashed or held against his will, and that they were fantastic friends. 

However, one can only imagine what he could have done as a professional. He moved like a Welterweight but he was built not like the heavyweights of his era but more like the human monsters that make up the elite of this era. 

Stevenson vs John Tate was sensational and the commentary by Foreman is really a testament to what could have been(4:25 if you want to see someone out on their feet): 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW7MkLz6vxs

Here is the full Olympic fight between Tyrell Biggs and Stevenson
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTiqc8TaTnk

You can see just how amazing he looks for a big man, and powerful. Tyrell Biggs was a very accomplished fighter with 108-6-4 record in the amateurs including two wins over Francesco Damiani, Damiani would later get his revenge in the professional circuit: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYJgMxWuduM

Biggs was a very talented fighter who struggled with drug and alcohol but he managed to have a win over lennox Lewis and he won a gold in the olympics
Here is Biggs vs Lewis great Olympic quarter final: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjUC6xys_QA

When you think about the timing of around Stevenson Career if he had been a professional he would have certainly faced Ali who would have had an amazing fight. He would have faced Larry Holmes, I can see him winning any of these fights, but certainly not all Olympic fighters do well at the professional level.  

Watching video’s of him, with a helmet on, then victorious he raises his opponent in the air out of respect. Sensational: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULqfYxzxcd4&amp;feature=related

When Tyson broke down in an interview it was when he was asked what he missed about boxing, no matter how much I try to sympathize, even by today’s standard I can’t imagine turning down a million, out of national pride, but that is exactly what Stevenson did, and that is what makes him an amazing human. Stevenson was given the honor of being the country's national Amateur coach by Fidel Castro who also gave him a place to live.

##Roman Martinez vs. Juan Carlos Burgos
***Round 1:*** Both guys already getting busy. Martinez to the body

10-9 Burgos

***Round 2:*** Burgos showing supreme ring generalship. He's moving Martinez to where he wants and engaging in range. Martinez then manages to corner Burgos and send shots to the body. Combos to the head and body at the one minute mark by Burgos. Good engagement by Martinez at the end nearly steals him this round. Nearly.

10-9 Burgos

***Round 3:*** Damn. Burgos hooks to the body are just beautiful — this will be a great investment for the later rounds. These body shots are just vicious. Martinez finally gets close and send some shots on the inside. That's the kind of work he needs to do if he wants success.

10-9 Burgos

***Round 4:*** It seems to me as though Burgos body shots are successfully slowing Martinez down Martinez pushes Burgos to the ropes. He's just unleashing everything he can — but Burgos is replying well. Burgos Looks to me that if Martinez is to win this

10-9 Burgos

***Round 5:*** Same story for this round. As long as Burgos is away from the ropes

10-9 Burgos

***Round 6:*** Burgos amps up the activity. He's now beating the crap out of Martinez — and these shots are landing just a little too cleanly. Martinez is attempting to get Burgos to the ropes

10-9 Burgos

***Round 7:*** Martinez to he ropes, this would have been a Martinez round if he didn't get caught!

10-9 Burgos

***Round 8:*** Martinez launches himself trying to overcome Burgos

10-9 Martinez

***Round 9:*** Martinez realizes he's losing so immediately sends Burgos to the ropes where he unleashes his power shots. Burgos waiting till Martinez tires before replying with his own body shots. Burgos now dancing away from Martinez wide looping shots. Better shots by Burgos

10-9 Burgos

***Round 10:*** Burgos now treating Martinez body like a pinball machine. Martinez do all he can

10-9 Burgos

***Round 11:*** Even though Martinez is way down on my scorecards, Burgos replies to the body. Martinez amps up his activity. He's getting more meaningful shots this round. 

10-9 Martinez

***Round 12:*** Both guys giving it them all. Burgos is trying to close the show

10-9 Burgos

**Official Result** Scores: 117-111 for Burgos

## Gennady Golovkin vs. Gabriel Rosado
***Round 1:*** Well

10-9 Golovkin

***Round 2:*** Good body shot by Rosado gets through — but Golovkin is dictating the pace. Golovkin just beginning to turn up the punch volume. Right hand tags Rosado hard! There's an ugly cut opening on Rosado's left eye! I just can't imagine this lasting long. Rosado being more active

10-9 Golovkin

***Round 3:*** Right hand by Rosado actually hurts Golovkin! Well

10-9 Golovkin

***Round 4:*** SMH. Nothing but admiration for Rosado. Admiration. Golovkin still patient

10-9 Golovkin

***Round 5:*** Good right hand by Rosado hurts Golovkin — with Golovkin nodding his head. Rosado now coming forward pressuring Golovking now! Golovkin now retreating. Golovkin amping it up with a left hook to the body! Both trade now. Not entirely sure if I should

10-9 Rosado

***Round 6:*** Round begins but Smoger pauses the fight so the doctor can look at Rosado's eye.  They deem him good. Action starts. Righ hook rocks back Rosado! He's not looking good in there! Somehow

10-9 Golovkin

***Round 7:*** The doctor looks at Rosado's eye again. Somehow

**Official Results** Golovkin TKO7 Rosado

## Orlando Salido vs. Mikey Garcia
***Round 1:*** Good styles match-up so far. Salido coming forward while Garcia calculating his distance. OH GOD! SALIDO GOES DOWN! Did not see that coming! Salido is hurt! Garcia patiently not forcing anything — knowing there may be more to Salido. Salid moves inside

10-7 Garcia

***Round 2:*** Good combo by Garcia stuns Salido. Salido, though. 

10-9 Garcia

***Round 3:*** Salido attempting to get inside. Garcia is using his legs and his jab to keep him at bay. RIGHT UPPERCUT TO THE CHIN FORCES SALIDO DOWN! Somehow he gets up! Still

10-8 Garcia

***Round 4:*** STRAIGHT RIGHT TAGS SALIDO'S CHIN AND HE'S DOWN FOR A FOURTH TIME! This is as dominant a debut title fight from anyone I've seen! Garcia is like a Bible of boxing! Salido now marches forward! He gets inside and manages some body shots! Garcia still patient waiting for Salido to just get into distance. Looping right hand by Salido gets in followed by combos. Garcia ties him up. For a guy who's been knocked down four times

10-8 Garcia

***Round 5:*** Right hand rocks Salido! Salido still patient! Garcia sends a jab followed by a right that rocks Salido again! Garcia just does a dominant job of taking Salido apart again and again. Salido's eye is getting swollen.

10-9 Garcia

***Round 6:*** Salido manages to get a looping shot in

10-9 Garcia

***Round 7:*** Salido with a few looping right hands manages to catch Garcia! Garcia now countering with his own vicious shots! Salido attempting to pressure Garcia! Uppercut by Garcia! Salido still lively here — and actually has more punches this round. In last 10 seconds

10-9 Garcia

***Round 8:*** Big right hand shakes up Salido! Garcia with a wide hook tags Salido hard! Salido may be losing

10-9 Garcia

**Official Result** Doctor is stopping the fight due to the ""accidental"" headbutt causing Garcia's broken nose. This therefore goes to the score cards. Scores: 79-70,,False,,t5_2qj0l,1358659392.0,,True

1375098897.0,1j9rw8,A begging email - making my white collar debut for charity on Friday,fred_carver,32,7,6,"Hi

So

So I'm making my white collar boxing debut on Friday. I'm 6'1"" and around 88kg and I'm fighting a guy who is 6'2"" and was 106kg when he started training - he's a bit lighter now but he's still a good deal heavier than me. But our relative experience should cancel out that advantage. When he started training 10 weeks ago he'd never been in a boxing gym before whereas I've been doing a bit of sparring (nothing serious) and been in and out of boxing gyms on and off for about 5 years - not to mention that I did the full 10 weeks training for a white collar show in March only to have my fight cancelled at the last minute.

So it should be a good fair fight

(Also if any of you are in London [this is the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/426171674156804/) and it should be a cracker. My tickets are all sold out but if you're quick you might be able to get some off the organisers).

**Anyway** the reason I'm taking up your time with this is because I'm doing it for charity too. Mine is the [Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice](http://www.srilankacampaign.org/welcome.htm) and in the interests of full disclosure I should point out I work for them. But they really are an incredible organisation, have already. The Sri Lanka Campaign are an absolutely tiny organisation, but one which has real clout. I love them to bits and by making them the charity I'm fighting for I like to think I'm joining the long line of pacifist boxers with Ali in the middle of it.

**So if you are feeling generous [please send me a couple of quid

I really appreciate it,False,,t5_2qj0l,1375099108.0,,,t3_1j9rw8

Yet, ""What would have happened if Ali fought Teófilo Stevenson?""

Ali fought Liston, Norton. Yet, the one notable name he did not fight was perhaps one of the *other* all time greats: Teófilo Stevenson. Who was Stevenson?

Quite simply

By no means am I saying either Ali or Stevenson were *less* great because they did not fight each other — but the fight came agonizingly close to happening. In 1976

***

I highlight the above story to explain why *I* think Donaire-Rigondeaux is a big deal. 

Rigondeaux is one of the greatest amateur boxers of all time, and is fighting *the* best boxer below 140lbs in Nonito Donaire. Should he win against Donaire, we should consider whether Rigondeaux is, in fact, one of the greatest fighters of all time — *regardless* of amateur or professional status.

What of Donaire then? What if he does what he's expected to do — and wins by spectacular KO?

Even as Donaire is considered a top 5 P4P boxer, Sydorenko, Montiel, and Nishioka — but as good as these fighters are, none of them should be considered *great*. In 20 years, nobody will look in the history books and be comparing *those* guys to the likes of Flash Elorde, Carlos Zarate

But they will talk about Rigondeaux — even as Rigondeaux has yet to make a definitive mark in pro boxing. 

***
In the future

Greatness is defined by the ability to meet big challenges head on, each anxious to prove he is the better man, willing to test the limits of his own self-belief.

**CHAMPION: Sergio Martinez 50 - 2 - 2 (28 KO’s)**

It’s great to have a middleweight champion.  Aside from the heavyweights, Leonard, and Robinson, the Middleweight crown is one of the most prized possessions in our sport.  And we’re lucky to have such a proud owner.  Since earning his seat on the throne with a decisively bloody victory over Kelly Pavlik, Martinez has done nearly everything in his power to do his 160 lb forefathers proud.  Not only has he grown into the weight once thought too large for the natural Jr. Middleweight, but Martinez has also managed to grow a punch as well, having dispatched nearly all contenders in violent fashion.  On top of that, Jr. that almost crumbled in the dramatic 12th round.  At 38

1.    **Daniel Geale 29 - 1 (15 KO’s)**  - In an almost textbook case of prospect-to-contender-to-titlist progression, Geale is a unified titlist who can be credited with ending the lengthy, uneventful reigns of two of Germany’s most protected titlists, Sturm and Sylvester.  Now that he’s got two belts in his possession, it will be exciting to see who will finally challenge the meteoric rise of this contender.

2.   **Gennady Golovkin 25 - 0 (22 KO’s)** - We’ve heard the hype and-more importantly-we’ve heard the punches.  Golovkin arrived in the states not with a literal bang as his brick-like hands thudded into the poor flesh of a game Proksa.  And with the beating of the prospect came the beating of the war drums.  Everyone wants to see Golovkin fight, make him a promoter’s dream.  If only he wasn’t every other promoter’s nightmare.

3.   **Austin Trout 26 - 0 (14 KO’s)** - After seeing his boring but clear victory over Delvin Rodriguez, Austin Trout’s gained the appreciation of most boxing fans.  And that appreciation has helped bolster his case for a long awaited and lucrative match-up against everyone’s favorite Opie, Saul Alvarez.  It’s a fight that was impossible 2 years ago, highly unlikely years ago, and all but certain today.  And he’s got more than a fighting chance.

4.   **Saul Alvarez 41 - 0 - 1 (30 KO’s)** - The Ginger Goose that lays Golden Boy Eggs has gradually fought his way into the approval of his peers.  What once many deemed a young, and one could argue he still isn’t in his prime.  And with 42 fights already under his belt, he might have the veteran experience already waiting for his body to catch up.  Regardless of whether he wins or loses in his pick’em bout with Austin Trout, Alvarez has near limitless potential.

5.   **Floyd Mayweather, indicating the polarity with which fight fans approach Floyd’s resume.  While half of the boxing community at large praises Floyd’s accomplishments and recognizes him as the #1 contender of this division after his victory over Cotto, the other half of the community expectedly and understandably believes his ventures and status as a Middleweight to be momentary and over-blown.  While the work he’s done at the weight is scarce, it is definitive, as he is effectively now a two-time 154 lb titlist.  His next fight will take place at welterweight, but if everyone’s wish comes true, we’ll likely see him return to this weight in September.

6.   **Peter Quillin 28 - 0 (20 KO’s)** - With a nickname like Kid Chocolate, and fellow prospects, Quillin finally lived up to his hype in an exciting and impressive performance against N’Jikam.  In a fight that had him pitted against an athletic, elusive, and undefeated opponent, Quillin’s poise and power saved the day as he dropped his man six times to pick up his middleweight title.  Now that he has a belt, though, or whether he’ll get complacent behind easy defenses and a name.

7.   **Julio Cesar Chavez, they hated his padded record, and they hated the snotty way he believed he’d live up to his name.  But then he gave Marco Antonio Rubio a drubbing, and he absolutely ran through Andy Lee, and then we started respecting.  And as we smugly sat back, watching our champion pick and hack at Chavez, Jr’s face for 11 and half rounds, we saw not only glimpses of Chavez, Jr. found himself belt-less and suspended.  Luckily

8.   **Carlos Molina 21 - 5 - 2 (6 KO’s)** - Even with an ugly style and and uglier record, Molina compiled a decent run of victories that was capped with a victory over Kermit Cintron and other prospects.  But when you have a record like his and a burgeoning well of talent, it gets hard to find fights.  Luckily, after losing via contested DQ to Kirkland, Molina bounced back with a victory over Cory Spinks to get his name back up there.  

9.   **Dmitry Pirog  20 - 0 (15 KO’s)** - What began with a breakout performance over the highly touted Danny Jacobs ended in a troubling series of uninspired performances and injuries.  After pulling out of too many high profile bouts

10. **Ishe Smith     25 - 5 (11 KO’s)** - Like Carlos Molina above, unlike Carlos Molina, Ishe Smith’s road to the top has netted him a major title.  Will the new belt and new promoter help him keep his “elite” pants up?  We can only wait and see.

14. Voting Etiquette
________________________________________
1. You should vote on comments from users based on:
•	The value of the question: Questions should be original and on topic. They aren’t required to be
•	Civility and Politeness: users are free to (and encouraged to) ask tough questions. But this should be done in a respectful and polite way. There’s no need to use harsh language
•	Asking for Proof: having legitimate posts is vital to maintain the integrity of /r/iama
•	You should downvote insults and rude behavior (“F__k you because X”). This is not to say that you shouldn’t ask tough questions. But do it in a civil, and they shouldn’t be harassed for doing so.
•	You should downvote non-questions and other “substanceless” comments that don’t make an interesting point or ask a good question (Ex: “I love you!”, remarks on their answers, etc. are all encouraged, but jokes and puns should not be. 
•	You should downvote joke questions that aren’t intended to get a real answer
•	You should downvote attempts to back the OP into a corner; asking tough questions is fine
________________________________________
2. You should vote on an OP’s comments based on:
•	A response that addresses the question(s) being asked: The OP’s answer is pretty much always relevant to the discussion (it is their topic
•	A thorough and detailed answer: If the OP is just using one-word answers or giving flippant responses
•	Good humor and playing along with friendly banter
•	If you disagree with the OP’s opinion, which just hides the comment from being seen by anyone and makes the AMA harder to navigate.
________________________________________
3. Voting on IAmAs
•	Whether the OP has interesting information or experiences, or not put effort into answering questions. Rather than downvoting, which just hides the comment from being seen by anyone, offer a reply with your reasoned thoughts. This way, you can open a dialogue with op and potentially debate the differing points of view.
•	Upvote for providing proof in the post. If there is no proof, then report it to the mods. 
•	Once it has started

* Anthony Mundine
* Felix Sturm
* Sebastian Sylvester
* Osumanu Adama
* Roman Karmazin

But I'm not writing this post to pump up Geale but to note something interesting about HBO's schedule. With Geale added to the line-up, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., and Daniel Geale. Peter Quillin — who I regard to be better than Chavez — is a Showtime fighter.

**Should I be worried about getting hurt?**

""No.  In our first year, the match is stopped immediately so that bleeding does not continue and the blood can be dealt with in a medically appropriate manner.  Boxing club members train and spar under the direct supervision of Mr. Bickford, who is trained in first aid.  Students are not allowed to spar without the appropriate protective equipment (mouth guard, headgear, gloves, and athletic supporter).  Students have the option of stopping a match at any time they feel unable to continue.  As an additional precaution, students are required to have a sport physical and the appropriate insurance paperwork filled out prior to the season to insure that they are fit to participate.""

It's not about how often you win or lose

Case in point: last week

Not only did Rodriguez win last week

This anecdote aside, or they didn't have a manager who brought them up carefully. 

Think of this list, recent titlists, or serious contenders. 

**1. Orlando Salido - 39(27)-12-2**

The recent WBO titlist who KOed Juan Manuel Lopez in one of the most stunning upsets in recent memory. One year later

**2. Sam Soliman - 43(17)-11**

On an 8 fight win streak

**3. Gamaliel Diaz - 37(17)-9-2**

Current WBC super featherweight titlist who recently shocked the world by defeating Takahiro Ao. Also the only man to have defeated Robert Guerrero.

**4. Mario Rodriguez - 15(11)-6-4**

Current IBF minimumweight titlist

**5. Sonny Boy Jaro - 34(24)-11-5**

Former lineal flyweight champion who KOed the legendary Pongsaklek Wonjongkam. He then lost his WBC title to Toshiyuki Igarashi by SD — some would say controversially.

**6. Jesus Soto Karass - 27(17)-8-3**

Gave Mike Jones all he could handle

**7. Rolly Matsushita - 31(19)-8**

Current OPBF titlist who's on a 6 fight win streak

**8. Carson Jones - 34(24)-9-3**

The dude responsible for wrecking Said Ouali and Ricardo Williams Jr.'s careers. He almost did the same to Kell Brook when he lost be close MD in an IBF eliminator.

**9. Michael Domingo - 45(24)-16-2**

This guy hasn't had a clear loss since 2006. His losses to Drian Francisco and Vusi Malinga were to close for comfort. Constantly hovering near title contention.

## Jermell Charlo vs. Harry Joe Yorgey
***Round 1:*** Thus far

10-9 Charlo

***Round 2:*** Charlo with more great jabs. And then Yorgey goes down! Only for the second time in his career! Yorgey gets up

10-8 Charlo

***Round 3:*** Yorgey now getting more cautious. He's barely moving beyond his high guard. But impressively

10-9 Charlo

***Round 4:*** Yorgey is amping up his aggressiveness with some lateral movement. Bad idea. Charlo's stiff jabs get through and stagger him to the corner. Charlo is getting aggressive now — much more aggressive than in previous fights. I think he can close the show.

10-9 Charlo

***Round 5:*** Got to agree with Bernstein. Charlo is getting a little too patient here — to his detriment. In fact, Charlo's still win this on workrate and accuracy.

10-9 Charlo

***Round 6:*** Great right hands to start the round by Charlo. Yorgey ain't reacting well to it. But to his credit

10-9 Charlo

***Round 7:*** What can I say? Another great round by Charlo. If I were to criticize Charlo it would be that he seems to lack a killer instinct. He doesn't seem all that eager to end the fight.

10-9 Charlo

***Round 8:*** Looks like Charlo's patience payed off. He sent a few jabs, hopes to collect his senses, rises just at the count of eight, but it's clear his head isn't clear. Bayless stops the fight.

**Official Result** Charlo KO8 Yorgey

## Selcuk Aydin vs Jesus Soto Karass
***Round 1:*** Both fighters are doing excellent work. For Karass to win this, so he has no hope but to go inside. Shouldn't be a problem with Karass, though. I'm liking Karass' body work here. Giving this round to him.

10-9 Karass

***Round 2:*** Karass with the first meaningful punch — a hard right that connects with Aydin's head. Aydin's jab being unexistent. Looks like he's always loading up on the right. Karass having much more of an arsenal here with jabs and good work to the body.

10-9 Karass

***Round 3:*** Aydin doing better work this round. He's begun to find his range, he could actually start winning this fight. As it is, though, Karass is still coming forward and being more busy.

10-9 Karass

***Round 4:*** I think I got to disagree with the SHO announcers. I think Aydin's doing the better work this time. He's got a great hook that's connecting to Karass

10-9 Aydin

***Round 5:*** Both are doing what they're supposed to do. But since Karass has an enormous physical advantage

10-9 Karass

***Round 6:*** Karass with the greater arsenal here. I'm not going to say what has already been said in other rounds.

10-9 Karass

***Round 7:*** Malignaggi makes a good point about Aydin. Usually, Aydin for some reason is trying to fight at the distance — despite being the shorter fighter with the shorter reach.

10-9 Karass

***Round 8:*** This is clearly Aydin's best round. He got some hard combos on Karass' head. Not once

10-9 Aydin

***Round 9:*** Great round for both! Yet

10-9 Aydin

***Round 10:*** Call me a coward, and some tremendous footwork causes Karass to work. To make it harder to score, both had some money shots right at the end. I'm scoring it for both.

10-10

**Official Results** Scores: 95-95

## Lucas Matthysse vs. Mike Dallas Jr.
***Round 1:*** Dallas Jr starting off the round tactfully. Using his jab, holds. Just as it seems as though Dallas Jr. looks to survive the round — BAM! — a short counter right by Matthysse connects. Lights out for Dallas Jr. WOW! What a statement!

## Wladimir Klitschko vs. Mariusz Wach

***Round 1:*** Klitschko's not monkeying around today. He's already throwing the right at Wach

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 2:*** Wach gets in a few lucky shots here and there

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 3:*** I'm impressed Wach finished the round. Klitschko's sending out more jabs to soften Wach up for the right. He's also got in some decent left hooks too. Wach isn't able to touch Klitschko with the jab

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 4:*** This is just target practice for Klitschko. Not that Wach isn't trying

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 5:*** Wach does his best impression of a human punching bag when — WHOA! WACH TAGS KLITSCHKO! GOOD GOD! HE WAS SAVED BY THE BELL!

10-9 Wach

***Round 6:*** Wow. This fight has gotten more dramatic. Wach has quite a chin

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 7:*** You can tell that Wach feels his chin holds up to Klitschko's power. He's waking right into Klitschko's punches to counterpunch with his own right. When he connects

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 8:*** This is like Rocky — and Wach is like Rocky. He's finished the round while Klitschko throws everything at him. Wach isn't thowing enough

10-8 Klitscho

***Round 9:*** Well

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 10:*** Klitschko's changing his tactics. He's now on the back foot

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 11:*** Well, jabs, rights, and the occasional hook. Boxing beautifully.

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 12:*** Klitschko resigns to Wach not being KOed. He's boxing, trying to fight back — but let's be honest. Klitschko wins this.

10-9 Klitschko

I normally watch fights either in a nearby sports bar or by ordering with a few friends at someone's house. This time I decided to go to watch it at a movie theater when I saw Dan Rafael of ESPN write about it.

Bought the ticket online a few days in advance to make sure I could get in. Ticket cost $18 plus some processing/tax BS, so the theater itself was relatively full (I'd say 90% of the seats were taken) with lots of Mayweather fans. Showed up just after 9pm, start of the 2nd round of the Latimore-Quintana fight, and were able to find some decent seats though the place was already filling up.

The whole experience was pretty awesome, and a comfortable chair to sit in. Lots of knowledgeable boxing folks around (since most casual fans probably just go to a bar, the theater crowd seemed like more dedicated boxing enthusiasts), so the place was full even for the undercards.

The only thing that sucked a little bit about it is food wasn't as easily available and there's no alcohol served, this might not be for you (or you'll have to find a place that serves alcohol too).

**TV Network/Show** HBO - Boxing After Dark

**What's the big deal?** What if Mike Tyson had a son who became a professional boxer? Picture this son having a prestigious WBC world title belt, and was not afraid to take a few shots in order to dish out his own. Would you watch his next fight?

Well

Here's the dirty secret about JCC Jr., protected from fighters who might expose his weaknesses -- with Top Rank milking his family name for all its worth in the hope that they can get an enormous payout of it.

Normally, they might have made a terrible mistake.

Peter Manfredo Jr. is what I like to call a ""lunch pail"" fighter. He holds a day job as a labourer, but (almost) always coming up short. His most famous try was in 2007 against Joe Calzaghe.

Manfredo has been in the ring with some great fighters -- and he knows JCC Jr. isn't one of them. He believes he can beat JCC Jr.

This is probably Manfredo's last chance at a title. It also may be the last time he gets a payday like this. If he fails against JCC Jr.

**What about the undercard?** Won't lie

One decent thing about this fight is that Green gives his all every time and tries to make it a fight. Good luck trying to do that against Clottey

**Predictions** Let's face it, it's probably a win for JCC Jr.

With a KO rate of 47%, this is unlikely.

As for Clottey-Green

is GGG signed with top rank? What if GGG fights Martinez, Number Two's battle versus Number One to become the One, one more time."" 

Martinez retires after the loss to GGG. GGG is middleweight king, Andre Ward beats JCC Jr for the second time.

Golden Gennady Golovkin versus the Golden Goose of Golden Boy happens. GGG KO's Canelo in the later rounds. 

GGG in a gentleman-like fashion tells the world, strong boy, ehhh he's good boy, but today I great strong man, (laughs). No I joke but he's great fighter, good champion, Andre Ward motha fucka we finna fight in Oakland.""

GGG vs Andre Ward, One, and we'll find out which One is the ONE. GGG KO's Ward in round one, Virgil Hunter says he threw a thumb at him. Matthysse is in the crowd and secretly moved up to 160 LBs ( He has already ended Khans and Garcia's Careers, twice); maintaining his strength, speed, and conditioning. He walks into the ring and looks GGG in the eyes

The Machine versus The Glorious Golden Gennady Golovkin. It is virtually even fight

They Challenge Zeus and Ares. They both land hooks that crush Zeus' and Ares' rib cages

Anyone else think that this is going to happen?

For now

Mitchell's first love is actually not boxing, his dreams of being a pro football player were quashed in 2005 due to damaged cartilage in his knee.

It looked like Mitchell's athletic career was over, have success in his boxing debut. Sensing that he too could have success as a boxer, in 2006, he stepped in the boxing ring for the first time as an amateur — eventually compiling a record of 9(9)-1. 

In 2008, he signed with Golden Boy Promotions. The next two years were spent testing his mettle against veteran journeymen Andrew Greeley, Jermell Barnes, and Zack Page — and continuing his undefeated record.

Then in 2010

Mitchell followed this up in 2011 with KO wins against Evans Quinn

In his last fight against Chazz Witherspoon

After recovering, the ref was eventually forced to stop the fight when it was apparent that Witherspoon was defenseless.

Having fought through adversity

We will find out when Mitchell faces off against Johnathan Banks (28(18)-1) this Saturday on the undercard of HBO's Broner-DeMarco main event. Mitchell is facing off against a former IBO cruiserweight with a formidable ring IQ — a boxing intellect appreciated by Wladimir Klitschko who hired Banks to man his corner during his last fight. Banks does not lose easily — his only loss being to Tomasz Adamek (right now rated as the #3 heavyweight by RING Magazine). 

As stated, with 12 of his 13 last fights ending by stoppage. If he can match ring wits with Johnathan Banks, he probably has a tremendous future in boxing.

Fonfara is a local Chicago favourite who's holding the IBO title. Here he's hoping to gain some credibility against the very capable Campillo who's performed well against the likes of Tavoris Cloud and Beibut Shumenov. Problem is

But the real reason to tune into ESPN2 is for Szpilka-Mollo II. [The first fight was a humdinger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhoMtkOa8s). If it is only half as good as the first fight

# **Network:** HBO / Sky Sports (UK) @ 9:45 pm EDT 
# **Match:** Daniel Geale vs Darren Barker

The middleweight with the best resume after Sergio Martinez is *not* Gennady Golovkin

So now he's making his American debut on HBO. Perhaps he's lined up for an eventual showdown against Martinez or Gennady Golovkin. 

But first
