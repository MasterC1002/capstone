--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is normally common knowledge that Alpha builds of games, a majority of the posts I see on this sub currently(aside from screenshots) are: ""Why things so obviously unbalanced for class X"" ""Don't exploit, that's cheating."" ""Wollay, why you not think of this OBVIOUS simple game design change"".


In an alpha
Our job as Alpha TESTERS (Even though we bought into it


Most importantly though, repeating them, finding more, all the while making a list of these issues to pass along to the dev. Examples of this are the known crossbow exploit, retreat climbing/gliding, the ability to equip a two hand and one hand weapon and get stats from both, etc etc.


When these things are pointed out they are met with disdain and a holier than though attitude. ""I cannot believe you would exploit that. You shouldn't exploit things


If you want to play the game straight, I will be exploiting the hell out of everything I can find.


In terms of class balance: Wollay has said that there will be more classes and races so balance will probably not be coming along until late alpha or early beta after he adds more content. This is pretty standard for ANY game.


In regards to oversights: This happens in all things. The best thing you can do about it is not be so incredulous when you point out one of these oversights or exploits. This is an early open alpha


The moral: stop pooping on the parades of people who Don't play the game like you do. This goes both ways.

 I figured I'd share my experience with each of the classes

- [Ranger](http://i.imgur.com/CMkjM6A.jpg): This is where the bias comes into effect (figured I'd get this out the way first), to getting up close and personal with a boomerang (which is what I did on this second ranger) to flying around via Super Jump (Retreat bug) and then using the glider. Granted the rogue can level at a much faster rate, but if you're clearing quests, ranger is undoubtedly the fastest, due to using the glider bug to get between key locations you can reduce your run times by about 5 - 20 minutes per inn reset. Also the boomerang gives you some prowess and a reason to get close to enemies, and not try engage them from massive ranges, as the closer you are to them, and then bring it back to you, so (in the very low amount of cases) where I wanted to go and play with friends

- [Rogue](http://i.imgur.com/TYwtes0.jpg): By far the strongest, and are decent and using the dodge feature) you can easily engage, fight, and kill red difficulty enemies as well as whites. You're boundless, and this killing power only goes to ramp up incredibly as you get more and more gear. I most definitely enjoy using two daggers over the other choices, it just made it feel more authentic in my opinion (though too my knowledge fist weapons are *apparently** better.) If you're just starting out or wanting a second class, definitely worth taking a look at Rogues. Preferred specialization: Ninja

- [Mage](http://i.imgur.com/9F5IKg6.jpg): I've got a love hate relationship with this class. They can sometimes do an incredible amount of damage, and sometimes just die before defending yourself is an option. While water mages have no need for food, as they are capable of using healing stream to heal themselves, rather than relying on potions. And the 3 different weapon types allow you to fit roles amongst friends, you can use the ***staff*** and use the AoE to heal your group up do some moderate damage, the ***wand*** if you want to deal a fair amount of damage and do some moderate healing, and ***2 bracelets*** if you want to churn out damage, to anyone out there who can play fire successfully I tip my hat to you.

- [Warrior](http://i.imgur.com/v3SkIzf.jpg):
While being one of the more resilient classes in the game, this was incredibly so in the case of **my** warrior. I found I was getting my ass handed too me by white/blues in the majority of encounters. This resulted in me having to spend more time collecting materials for potions than I did leveling up. But this doesn't go to say that I don't find them incredibly fun after level 15 or so. While feeling significantly weaker compared to it's counter parts. Nothing beats the feeling of charging head first into a pack unsuspecting travelers, using smash to knock them all over, and follow it up with cyclone to live them all pretty much dead before they can ever get up. Preferred specialization: Guardian, offers a *LOT* more survivability over berserker, at the cost of a very low amount of damage.

Well that's all I have to say, seriously I only just realized how much there actually is.

TL;DR - *God Dammit Loch Ness Monster

Edit; Grammar. 

Edit 2; I didn't think this would be so well received, and sorry to the Warrior fans I probably did butcher the image of the class, but It's just how I felt about the class, but this is not to say that I don't like the class, I do love the class, and enjoy it thoroughly",,self,Blue-Head,

1376763132.0,1kk6x7,"Wollay is a great programmer, but a REALLY BAD businessman, communicator and doesn't really care for his fans/players (UPDATE)",SadlyTheTruth,451,356, but I think it is important to highlight some crucial points since there are a huge number of new cubeworld fans that might not have been here for long.

What is becoming pretty obvious during this cubeworld alpha launch and the past few weeks is that despite how amazing cubeworld looks and how strong it is for an initial alpha

Unfortunately no matter how good a programmer Wollay is, his fans and how he operates cubeworld from a business point of view. Development of the game has been horrendously slow over the past few years and now that the alpha version is out I am fearful that we are going to have to wait months and months for any meaningful update or new content/features to be added to the game. I certainly have no desire to play the current alpha for more than a few hours... I just have no direction in the game and nothing to do!

Not a lot of people know this, or even communications (on websites or twitter). Quite often he would go awol during very crucial moments in the development of cubeworld and we were simply left dumbfounded as to what was going on for months at a time. As someone who has been watching and waiting for cubeworld for over 2 years, it pains me to see new cubeworld fans/players coming to terms with how wollay develops cubeworld and also how he communicates with the community (never!). I completely understand the frustration of newer people around here who see this way of developing a game and interacting with your players/fans as rude and uncaring.

Let's take a closer look at some of the really bad mistakes that have been made recently:

* Releasing a closed alpha to very privileged youtubers and famous people - completely stomping on any fans or players who has been waiting patiently for the game for the past 2 years. Some of the people who Wollay gave early access to hadn't even heard of cubeworld until this moment.

* Deciding to develop his own website infrastructure with account registration and shop and also his own game downloader and updater that was pretty obviously never going to be up to the high demand of the players yet rather than use a solid solution or other platform that is know to be capable of handling this load

* Refusing to accept any help from the big players or support from people who do digital distribution all the time, and instead was happy to have the constant downtime, unavailable service.

* Lack of communication or visibility of what is going on. (We haven't heard anything from wollay for **over a month!**)


I love cubeworld and the game looks wonderful and really is the game I want to play and to be developed into a full and complete game, his lack of communications/updates and the general slowness of his development process makes me believe I wont be enjoying cubeworld for a VERY VERY long time. Maybe I will come back to cubeworld in 2015 and see where things are then.

**TL;DR: Basically wollay is a great programmer and cubeworld is good so far, development times are slow and he constantly refuses help from anyone, even high profile people who could help him solve many of the operation problems of cubeworld**

1372896071.0,1hlomi,"An academic discussion and criticism of the alpha launch (or ""no, these bumps probably aren't a sign of the future, and here's why"")",lendrick,278,73

I'm a software developer.  I do web development as a career (some of that time was spent working on a very large and heavily trafficked site where scale issues were at the forefront)

The reason I'm posting this is to provide a counterpoint (other than ""stop being a whiny little baby"") to the [current top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hla9q/picroma_poor_launch_choices_a_sign_of_the_future/)

The short answer is this:  Launches are difficult, according to his twitter, already making progress on this front.  Once the scaling issues are fixed, it seems unlikely to me that they'll ever come back in a major way.  Even if sales do eventually increase past launch levels later on, the improvements made right now should carry it through just fine.  At the very least, there will be some amount of warning of impending scaling problems, because things will most likely slow down for a while before they crash.

That being said

From the developer side, it's more important that things *work*.  It is of course entirely possible to be *too* gung-ho about reusing code.  Many developers have had a boss push a codebase on them that's unsuited to a particular task, and it's *actually faster* to write something from scratch than mucking around in the horrible innards of some badly written library or framework trying to hack in a necessary feature that it simply can't provide.

In the case of e-commerce applications, and can be adapted to handle most situations with a little bit of custom glue code.  It is *possible* that Wollay ran into something that existing free e-commerce frameworks can't provide, but in all honesty it seems pretty unlikely.

If I were supervising a brilliant, I would require them to provide me with a solid justification for doing so.  I don't know the internals of Wollay's reasoning for rolling it himself (more critique on communication later), but what I state with certainty is that there are other perfectly viable options than ""build it all from the ground up in C++"" and ""pay someone else 30% of my profits to use their distribution platform"".  I can't really conceive of a hypothetical situation that would render existing e-commerce code useless -- if anyone can think of any possibilities, I'd love to discuss them.  Feel free to post them in a reply.

As a brief disclaimer, I don't know how much experience he's had with coding, and I don't know what reasoning he might have had for choosing to roll his own e-commerce code.  I'm just guessing based on what I've seen here and what I've seen other developers (myself included) do in the past.  If he ever writes up a postmortem of the launch, I would love to read it.

From the standpoint of a fan, Wollay is just one guy, so a daily blogging schedule might not be reasonable, but if you page back far enough in this subreddit, you'll find long stretches of time with no posts whatsoever, broken up with the occasional ""what happened to Wollay?"" post.  One or two tweets a week would have been sufficient to show people that the project was still moving.

Given the intensity of the hype surrounding the launch, no progress, ETA unknown"".  

At any rate, periodically (and *reliably*) throwing people a bone in the form of a progress update does a lot to alleviate it while maintaining pre-release hype that sells games.

So, for whatever reason(s), suffering from poor execution.  It's natural, particularly given the relatively infrequent communication during these issues, for people who are excited about the launch (and potentially frustrated that they missed their window to get the game earlier than everyone else), to speculate about the causes of the delay.

For Wollay's part, at this point he needs to deal with them as quickly and as well as he can, because it's too late now to go back and start making massive structural changes to his code.

In conclusion:  Yeah, there's really nothing to be angry at Wollay about.  He's just one guy, and you can bet that right now he's working his ass off to get the game released as soon as possible.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hlomi/an_academic_discussion_and_criticism_of_the_alpha/

1373530143.0,1i2hf0,A few things I have to say about Cube World...,LJJ1991,219,37,133,"Before you upvote, understand this: I am LOVING Cube World. So

1.) THIS GAME IS HARD. No, this game is hard. Thank goodness there's no (evident) penalties to death because I've died a lot. But this isn't a bad thing, I enjoy a challenge. It forced me to get better at the game fast and now I'm doing pretty well. I will say, the difficulty of the enemies can be a tad on the hilarious side. I took out a squad of heavily armed Goblins no sweat but heaven forbid I encounter a SQUIRREL. *shudders at the thought*

2.) Wow, but nothing to this extent. That lamp you carry around is a freakin' lifesaver. It doesn't matter if your deep in a cave or outside in the deep of night, the area around is pitch black and you never know what's beyond your tiny circle of light. I was literally getting creeped out as a slowly moved through a pitch black canyon, lest I encounter an enemy that causes me to jump out of my skin. I haven't felt that kind of anxiety in an exploration game since delving deep into my first deep mine in Minecraft. 

3.) The graphics are beautiful. I'm a huge fan of pixel art and I loved Minecraft's graphics, the vibrant canvas created simply by looking out into the distance... wonderful.

4.) The game doesn't feel like an alpha. I'm not sure how everyone else has faired, controls, and combat have felt incredibly fluid and responsive. All of the objects in the environment have functioned correctly, and I haven't gotten stuck or anything. At this point, it just seems like Picroma wants to add features. The fact that it feels so polished is incredible. Well done, Picroma.

EDIT: When I was talking about the game not feeling like an alpha, which will come in the future.

Cube World is filling an RPG void that I've been trying to fill for a very long time! =D

1373317943.0,1hw1qo,Open list of known bugs and suggestions for the future.,Magician_Hisoka,187,21,196,"So it seems to me that having a single source of known bugs and suggestions might be very convenient for Wollay

----------------------------------

Bugs:

1.Fish reset bug, when you're directly above them, and when they get caught in a small trench.

2.Ranger glider glitch

3.Dual wield bug

4.Scout's 3 skill crashes the multiplayer server.

5.Ranger starts with a Wand +1 in the inventory

6.Shops don't seem to sell crossbows

7.I once had a mission inside a city (something about killing attacking Gnobolds)

8.Adaption cost for items has a calculation error and as a result is waaaay to high. As of now

9.Pets do not level up properly on multiplayer servers and will ""reset"" to their initial state at random intervals and/or when you equip or unequip them.

10.Hitting a menu button (tab

11.Bombs

12.Generation clipping (most common is resurrection stone

13.Pets lose levels when renamed / swapped when dead

14.Ranged AI never misses with channeled casts if you move (Mage staff

15.Some classes can spam Right Click and deal more damage than attacking with left click

16.Some enemy hitboxes are very unintuitive (good example are the troll mission bosses)

17-19.There's a bug with the Ninja's unique class ability. Dodging attacks normally restores some of your mana and gives you a crit buff, when it's only supposed to give the auto-crits to your next special attack.

20.It is possible to warp through building walls from the outside if there is a chair or bed along the inside wall; just hit R and you will teleport through the wall onto the bed or chair.

21.When you craft an item

22.If your pet dies whilst riding it you will continue riding an invisible mount at mounted speed.

23.You can jump or retreat while eating.

24.Changing your name to longer than 16 character crashes client

25.When sitting down, however still consumes one from the inventory. This also effects all consumable used directly from your inventory.

26.Occasionally running down hills my character flashes as if he is taking damage

27.You can use the item in the quick item slot while dead

28.Occasionally when taming a pet it gets tamed

29.Holding alt will cause game to freeze. Longer it is held

30.Bats spawn in underwater caves.

31.Riding a peacock in water causes the peacock's neck to retract

32.Pets can be stunned while riding

33.When killed while poisoned

34.Using any consumable while sitting consumes the item without gaining any HP.

35.The night time crickets keep chirping when I switch from night to day at the INN.

36.Sometimes when you die you'll respawn in a location that is impossible to get out of without bombs

37.When crafting, in which case, the crafting completes without an item being consumed.

38.When crafting, but the item is still crafted.

39.Client locks up when no server is immediately found to join.

40.Joining a map immediately puts you in the map whilst loading

41.Losing connection to a server immediately resets monsters on the map.

42.Inn Keeper's time reset notification is incredibly loud.

43.Cannot sleep while weapon is drawn (though this may be to keep from sleeping during battle)

44.If you stand near a window and use a dash ability of some sort, etc. you can jump through, bypassing the bulk of most dungeons.



------------------------------------------

Suggestions

1.Lava lands and oceans need more ambiance, most notably at night. Perhaps occasional glowing seaweed or something like that along the bottoms. Oceans could also use slightly more murkiness during the day, but that's not a big deal.

2.Also in ocean biomes, point at a fish, hold left click, and kill them through just auto attacks often before I even see their names or health. This gives around 10xp a pop, making leveling in the early game far easier if you can find an ocean than anywhere else.

3.Ocean biomes, but it might be better to make people in boats unattackable by fish mobs.

4.The berserker's 3 feels rather underwhelming, because as it is their playstyle is more based around hit and run instead of tanking if they are fighting enemies that probably won't die in a single whirlwind.

5.Fire mage's 1 also feels rather underwhelming, but fire mages probably need another more heavily offensive spell. Although perhaps not the wizard/witch lasers, unless those get nerfed.

6.Perhaps nerf the witches/wizards, mostly cause they burst people down in 1-2 seconds.

7.Liches and cyclopses need a buff. My warrior has found and tanked down two liches so far, but not nearly as bad.

8.And while I think about it

9.This'll probably get added in as more skills do, clone of player, weak clone of self) charge attack, or spin attack. They probably need some more skills, although admittedly most of the left over player skills could lead to frustration rather than enjoyment(heals, scout 3 ability and kiting the player, more of the nearly instant leap attacks

10.Humanoid outdoor bosses have ungodly large healthbars. I'm all for hard fights, resetting progress.

11.Berserker spec feels incredibly lackluster. I think the warrior in general as well as the assassin spec could use a little love.

12.The game could use a few money sinks. I'm sitting on heaps of gold with nothing to spend them on.

13.Shops are next to useless. Besides the glass bottles and the occasional low-level item

14.While we're at shops

15.Hire-able mercenaries.

16.More variance in crafting recipes

17.A reason to visit specific biomes. Crafting ingredients would be good here

18.A way to locate teleport stones easier. Perhaps the mage in town could sense the general direction so you have a starting point.

19.A way to fast travel between towns like airships etc. And possibly something like a town portal spell.

20.Map markers for the world map. Left click to drop marker

21.Toggle map markers on/off

22.A system for inviting players to your party and kicking them in game. People do not auto join a party

23.Multiple item stacks of same item in inventory

24.More light is required in large towns.

25.Lava lands need to be a bit lighter they are too dark to see anything even with a lamp on.

26.Mark the place of your last death.

27.Give the rogue assassin a different #2 ability. Right now it only makes you invisible to when the mobs haven't seen you and moving in is really hard to actually want to use it. As soon as you get the #3 for the assassin the #2 becomes useless

28.I think he should add some items that give various bonuses like for example : boots that give +10 run speed and +5 jump.

29.Moving statics, waves, etc, as well as splashes along the sides of boats.

30.Add music for when using a vehicle or mount.

31.Include server browser with past addresses (and possibly server status)

32.Show player heads on map at all time

33.Make equipped potion redundant between game sessions.

34.Make different animals have different attributes while riding

35-39. More crafting options, more placable cubes for named weapons, maybe 48 or 64 cubes. And ""reforging"" weapons, that names them and possibly gives them a small stat boost or upgrades their rarity, adapts them and adds the customization bonus for being named.

40.For the world map. It would be nice if the names of the lands would show on the world map in the most zoomed out view

41.It would also be nice for each land to be color coded according to type on the map.

42.Missions need to be biome specific


That's it for now

You've been developing your game by yourself for years. Initial reports are favorable and then you get notch to tweet about the game. Basically the holy grail for an indie title like this. Then you get an Alpha version running that immediately get's picked up by the Yogscast and countless other youtubers and it's a giant love fest with literally not a single negative comment about the game despite some glaringly obvious bugs. 

It's obvious - this game will have a good launch. So being a person of at least minimum intelligence you understand that launch crashes hurt more than anything else because launching a game is like shifting into second gear - you MUST have some momentum for it to work or you are going to stall and you MUST keep that momentum or you will stall.

So knowing all of this you decide to... roll your own distribution and payment service and host it yourself? Wut da fuk? In the age of AWS you decide to risk the launch of your hugely anticipated game??!! Amazon will give you a freaking field of servers and bandwidth on the fly - the only problem you would have is keeping up with the demand.

In nearly every thread about Martyn's livestream there is some pretty severe criticism of his playing and an awful lot of whining about 'big names' getting to play the game early. I have to say

I recognize that Martyn's not at fault for getting access to the game; what he does is play video games and have people watch. That wollay chose him to play is no problem of his. In fact, it's probably good that he's not amazing at the game because a VAST majority of the people playing the game will not be great.

As for wollay's distribution style: I might not agree with his choice

**Tips:**

1. Create two worlds:
    - One world where your character is in a town for access to crafting and other town related activities.
    - One world where you're at your farming location.
    - Swap between these to be efficient and replace old gear quickly.

2. Find a boss and farm around it.
    - I farmed for quite awhile (probably level 3 or 4 to level 6) before fighting the first boss
    - Boss areas have a high but manageable amount/density of enemies.

3. When you enter an area with a boss and get the quest pop-up for it

4. (I will test this to make sure. -Binsou) Another tip for those who dont want to endure the long darkness of the night: Create a separate character and place him by the inn. Play your main character. If its too dark : logout the main, log in the main and you see the light again.  -Riverstomp


These are just the big things that I (Level 8 Rogue) found as I was playing.  If anyone has stuff to add

1372983662.0,1hnx5u,Leveled a water mage and a berserker warrior to level 5 my thoughts/ideas/bugs/opinions so far...,Evetss,148,30,161,"First off I want to say this game is very fun and I can't wait for future updates. Also the game is in alpha so I think it's a good idea to have a good discussion on things that can be improved

**Games I have played** - *Just a list of relevant mmos/rpgs so you can get an idea were I'm coming from*.

* **Rift** since launch quit mid hammerknell in a top 20 raiding guild and just came back after they went f2p.(They did f2p very nicely)

* **WoW** since late BC quit many times and recently quit in patch 5.2 probably will go back at some point. *They all come back*.

* **SWOTOR** since launch quit after my guild beat the first raid tier. All of the end-game was extremely buggy and lack luster.

* **TERA** for about a week. I really just didn't like this game.

* **Runescape** probably what brought me into mmos like a lot of people. Can't really remember when I started or stopped this game.

* **Diablo 2** Didn't play that much

* **Diablo 3** Played it for like a week because I got it free with the wow pass thing.

* **Torchlight** I beat it. That's all I remember.

* **Torchlight II** See *Torchlight*. Also much better than Diablo 3 imo. Might be because I really enjoy the art style of this series.

* **Pokemon** This is most people's first RPG. I think I've beat the elite four in all the generations. Never played yellow version. Fuck yellow version.

* **Zelda** I have played a lot of them

* **Minecraft** Has anyone not played this?

*That's all I can think of*.

**Tips** - *Few friendly tips for those just starting out.*

* If you aren't a water mage

* Kill range mobs first. If you come across a group of not-so-nice adventures always go for the ranged guys first. This is partly because range will never miss you

* I wouldn't recomend adventuring at night at a low level. Go talk to an in-keeper and he will make it 7 am for you. If you do find yourself in a dark situation press 'F'.

* Don't buy a hang-glider or boat until you have spec'd into it. They require a level 4 min. and then at level 4 you must put all your points into the corresponding spec.

* Pets are always good you can find pet items you pick up in the pet tab. These items are then put in your pet slot of your equipment. Then while near an animal that likes that item you will see the animal get a heart above it's head then you will be the proud owner of a pet. ([Link to pets and what stuff the like](http://cubeworldforum.org/topic/3781-list-of-foods-each-pet-eats-in-cube-world-guide-spoilers/))

*I might write some kind of full guide at some point in time.*

**Bugs** - *These are things that are straight broken with the game.*

**Edit:** *Added a bug. The community should really keep up with these and submit them properly when there is a way.*

* Holding O restores mana to full extremely fast.

* Pressing left-alt at will freeze the game.

* Aggro distance for rare mobs. (a turtle chased me over three mountains)

* Going from in-game to the start menu the sounds of nature persist.

* I have a pet hornet and he makes foot-step sounds.

* Sometimes the foot-step sounds align at some magical frequency and it sounds bad.

* Groups of 2 or more witches/wizards will one shot you even though their name is blue. (This doesn't happen against any other groups)

* Drop Rates for single player suck (I was at level 3 on my warrior and had 12 class specific drops and none were for me)

* The ability to Alt-Tab seems broken for me.*It some how is fixed when I switched it from windowed

* Equip a 2-handed weapon

**Bad Things** - *These are things that 'I feel' are broken with the game.*

* Level 1-3 is a pretty garbage experience if you are a warrior. The game-play consists of hit things, drink potion, repeat.(class balance discussed later.)

* Can't use a spirit cube with power 17 on a weapon power 14. Remove a bit of the restrictions at least at the lower levels. There is no worst feeling than working your ass off to kill a rare mob only to find out you don't have the exact right power level.

* The distance at which a mobs level can be determined. If I see a hornet in the distance shouldn't I be able to determine if it will destroy my anus

* Aggro distance I mentioned this earlier but I think retreating should be a viable option at least at the lower levels.

* The cost of the hang-glider/boat needs to be increased I acquired 10 silver pretty fast only to find out it was useless until I spec into it.

* Not being able to determine if the area your in is too ""far out"". Though I could see this taking away from the immersion.

* Mobs are a bit too sparse feels like to much walking. This could also be fixed by lowering the xp needed to level for the first few levels.

* Iron is too damn rare. I could craft my mage a full set of gear 8 times and only craft my warrior 2 weapons and 1 piece of gear. This could be fixed by lowering the cost of iron to make gear or make smelting produce more than 1 per on a regular basis.

**Class Balance** - *Mage vs Warrior (Water Mage is OP and more)*

Class balance in any rpg is kind of a big deal and I know it will never be perfect

The water mage is OP. Everyone has probably heard this by-now and many are already screaming nerf. I don't think a nerf is the way to handle it really. I think the real problem is that the other classes are possibly under-tuned and need a buff. In my opinion I really enjoyed playing the water mage and thought by itself it made for a great single-player experience. 

**Edit:** *Got to level 10 on the Water Mage my thoughts on how the nerf should be handled are below.*

I believe I recall wollay saying something about advanced specs were going to be added to the game. If this happens it will probably change pretty much everything

*General*

* Reduce all numbers for the Water Mage by 10%.

* From what I can tell tempo is kinda like haste from WoW and you gain haste per hit combo so by hit combo #20 you are insta-casting everything. I think that it's a great mechanic for probably every other class

*Healing Stream*

* Reduce the mana cost of the Healing Stream from 75 mana to 25 mana.

* Reduce the healing done Healing Stream from about 75% of the mages hp to about 25%.

* Increase the base casting time by just a second maybe less.

* Casting healing stream requires you to be stationary.

* Increase the time of stream part of Healing Stream.

* While Healing Stream is streaming you must be stationary.

* The stationary aspect to the nerf will allow for some 'skill'. When in combat you would have to recognize a knockdown proc from your 2nd ability

*Mana Shield*

* Make Mana Shield cost mana

* Allow Mana Shield to be put on friendly targets.

* Give Mana Shield a bigger graphic. Like a more solid blue sphere.

*Teleport*

* As it currently stands your mage will slow down while casting teleport then after the teleport he is still walking slow. This negates about half the teleport with 1 point into teleport and I imagine when you have 5 points in teleport it is good. Still fix the second slow.

* Maybe increase the cast time at max points. I don't really know about this one I haven't got a chance to play around with it at max.

**Edit:** *Reached level 10 on the warrior. General thoughts on the experience and how a buff could be handled.*

First off, as well as how I used them.

* **Smash** - I believe this is intended to be a charge

* **Cyclone** - I doubted this one at first

* **War Frenzy** - Still not really sure about this one. Doesn't really seem to flow with the combat as nicely as the other 2. It essentially allows you to use up your rage at a faster rate. I'd rather see something like an aoe rend. Really I just use this when the other 2 abilities are on cool down.

* My strategy for using these abilities usually goes Cyclone&gt;Smash&gt;War Frenzy. There 2 reasons for pulling with cyclone 1.) It has a longer cd

* I also got a chance to attempt a dungeon. It was catacombs style. I started at level 8 with about 80 potions (50 made 30ish unmade) and I ended at about half way through level 9 with no potions. The mobs were blue +1. (not sure what the +1 on a blue name means). I did not finish the dungeon the trash respond on me about 3 times

* I think there probably needs to be some kind of buff to melee classes. My Idea was giving melee classes a chance to parry attacks randomly. I think this would increase survive-ability a bit.

* The game as melee right now is borderline frustrating challenging with a few buffs it could become more excitingly challenging.

**Ideas** - *Most of this stuff might not be good ideas just thoughts really.*

*Some convenience things I think almost need to be in game.*

* **KEY BINDS** (This is really a must most any respectable pc game these days has key binds)

* Make 'num-lock' key auto walk and maybe auto craft somehow.

* The ability to use scroll-wheel for scrolling in the crafting/store windows

* Make 'esc' key close all the windows that you may have open like crafting/store/inventory/weapon customize.

* A Tutorial. I know many people don't want the casualized walk in the park rpg

* A guaranteed pet in the first town in the pet district that you could buy for like 1 silver. This would be in-case the RNG gods screw you over with pet drops. I had a pet at level 1 on my mage but didn't get a pet till level 3 on my warrior.

*The following are bigger ideas just more stuff I think that could add content to the world.*

* Specs for pets. There could be determined types of pets like tanking, hybrid and support and they should get maybe a single spec tree.

* The ability to dismantle items for more blocks. Might be kinda hard to tune this so that isn't the only way people obtain blocks.

* Crafting specializations. I like in cube world you can do all the crafting you want

* The ability to hire a mercenary in single player. Something like

* Factions of some kind. No one really seems to care that i'm a frogman or an orc in a village that is entirely made up of humans. Something as basic as a NPC mentioning my race could really add to the immersion. Or you could take factions to a higher level like the ability to steal from shops and if your caught then your rep is lowered. When quests are added doing a quest for a town might raise your rep. Then have rewards for having higher reputation with a town.

* Events like invasions

I'm really having a fun time with the game and would like to hear others thoughts on the issues I brought up.

**Edit 1:** *Reached level 10 on the water mage. Added a bug and commented on one. Added/changed some stuff under class balance

**Edit 2:** *Reached level 10 on the warrior. Added comments about the warrior class level 5-10 experience under the Class Balance section. Also I'll probably make another thread more about comparing warrior and mage.*",self,t5_2t4bs,1373021014.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hnx5u/leveled_a_water_mage_and_a_berserker_warrior_to/

If we translate the code into a human readable format

    experience = 50 + 1000 * ( 1 - 1/((level - 1)*0.05 + 1) )

Or simplified:

    experience = (1050 * level - 50)/(level + 19)

The truncated result of that formula at the decimal point (ignore everything after the decimal point)

We can use this function to make the following graphs for the levels 1 to 200:

[Experience needed to level up

[Total experience needed to reach a certain level](http://i.imgur.com/crWp8Lf.png)

Using the power of calculus

    total_experience = 50 (21 * (level - 1) + 400 * log(20) - 400 * log(19 + level))

Sadly enough

[Discrete total experience vs. continuous total experience](http://i.imgur.com/WgR1wbL.png)

We see that our function slightly overestimates the total experience needed. However

    experience_from_a_to_b = 50 * (21 * (level_b - level_a) + 400 * log(19 + level_a) - 400 * log(19 + level_b))

I'm going to hunt for the formula that /u/loboleal posted for the power level now. If you have any questions

Let's hope this doesn't get downvoted to oblivion for having ""Cheat Engine"" in the title :/

You can add in letter or any of the keywords you see there: SPACE, etc.

Be Gentle, leave the buttons in the order you see them. That's the order theyre assigned in).

One final note

**Edit: PS3 Controller Support**
If you want to use a PS3 controller

Basically, then run the ScpDriver.exe file (inside the main folder, then inside the 'bin' folder) (I 'ran as administrator' via right-click). Follow the link to the forum above for info about how the bluetooth works, but if you want it to run dirt simple just uncheck the Bluetooth option before you hit install. You'll have to play with the controller wired, but my program should work just fine with the PS3 controller after that.


**Original Post**

I saw a couple days ago that some people were looking for a way to use their 360 controllers with CubeWorld

Since Xpadder is not free (and because I was looking for a programming project)

Without further ado

**Some notes:**

Custom button bindings aren't in yet, so there shouldnt be any issues running in on your machine. It certainly shouldnt break anything (but if It does, I'm not responsible. Use at your own risk! Although, in reality the worst that should happen is that maybe a key gets 'stuck' in the OS, meaning you have to click it a few times on the actual keyboard or mouse to undo it, although I think I ironed out all of those scenarios).

You can also just use this as a dirt simple way to get an Xbox Controller working with Windows

I'm currently running Windows 8 x64, basic stuff, so I *think* this should work on 7 for sure, maybe even Vista and XP.

**Setup/Run**

Make sure your Xbox controller driver is installed before running. I just plugged in my wireless receiver and Windows 8 picked it up automatically

Other than that, then just run my program. It will ask you to hit Enter when you're sure your controller is connected, then you should be good to go!

**Controls:**

Left stick = WASD

*The left trigger is used for alternate button/key bindings

A: jump
LB/RB : left/right mouse buttons respectively 

X: 1 ability
LS: 2 ability (see below for why i chose this)
Y: 3 ability
B: Dodge 


I did this because most of the #2 abilities are self-buffs

RS: Pick stuff up

DPAD:
(This may be a little confusing
UP: Glider/boat
...LT+UP: Zoom in
LEFT: map
...LT+LEFT: R (ride pet, revive)
RIGHT: Quick Item
...LT+RIGHT: T (pet toggle)
DOWN: Lantern

Start: Item bag

1373459121.0,1i04d1,Just got my Water Mage to level 100 playing solo. Here is my strategy for the Water Mage and some general tips.,Evetss,126,21,112,"First I'd like to state that i'm aware that this is alpha and everything I say will possibly be irrelevant in the future.

The way I got to level 100 was not by grinding dungeons or cheat engine. Also I don't have a problem with people using dungeons or cheat engine to get to a high level

**Terms**

* Aggro - Attention/Threat
* AoE - Area of Effect
* LoS - Line of Sight
* Tank - Getting hit
* DPS - Damage Per Second
* Crit - Critical hit

**General Tips/Strategies**

* *Second Seed* - I did use a second seed (world) to re-spec and obtain flasks in the early game. This might be viewed as not playing completely legit

* *Resurrecting Pets* - If you click your pet out of the equipment slot then re-equip it

* *Turtle is the Best* - These guys are tamed with cinnamon rolls and they are complete bad-asses. The more I try different pets

* *Visiting a Town* - When visiting a town I get 50 flasks and 50 water filled flasks and make sure I've used all my Heartflowers to craft as many health potions as possible. This allows me to craft the maximum number of health potions without returning. Also check stores for lanterns

* *Crafting* - This should be done at every town visit while leveling at lower levels. Crafting at lower levels offered me many gear upgrades. Also I would recommend not using wood/gold for customizing at the lower levels because you won't have the same weapon for very long and often times you will be able to craft a better weapon.

* *Traveling* - I see a lot of people spend their skill points on hang gliding and riding before they have access to all their combat abilities. 
This is a horrible idea at low levels. I really didn't get any method of faster travel until around level 25 and even at that point I didn't put points into hang gliding AND riding. I would recommend putting skill points into riding first before hang gliding because you will get more combat efficiency putting points into your pets health than climbing. Climbing is pretty useless to put points into as a mage

**Water Mage Abilities**

* *Torrent* - When you hit your enemy consecutively it builds a combo. The higher your combo the faster your cast time is

* *Puddle Mechanic* - When using bracelets or wands you will see a blue circle appear at the feet of your enemy and if your standing inside the circle you will receive some minor heals. (The Effect is the same with staffs just no visuals)

* *Mouse 1* - If you have a staff it's *Water Swirl*

* *Mouse 2* - If you have a staff it's *Water Vortex*, have a cast time and have a chance to stun you enemy. The chance of stun seems to be about every 3 hits. That chance decreases if you enemy has a orange name or higher.

* *Healing Stream* - This ability is unlocked by spending points in the *Healing Stream* box in your skill tree. Spending more points in this ability decreases the amount of mp used when it casts. With one point in the skill the base cost is 93.18 mp and it heals for about 70% of your total health.(When you cast it for it's full mana cost.) You don't have to have the full mana cost to cast it. It will just heal for as much mana as you spend.

* *Mana Shield* - This ability is unlocked by spending points in the *Mana Shield* box in your skill tree and requires at least 5 points in the *Healing Stream* box. Spending more points in this ability decreases the cooldown. With one point in the skill the base cooldown is 19.09 seconds. It absorbs damage

* *Teleport* - This ability is unlocked by spending points in the *Teleport* box in your skill tree and requires at least 5 points in the *Healing Stream* box and 5 points in the *Mana Shield* box. Spending more points in this ability decreases the cooldown. With one point in the skill the base cooldown is 15.09 seconds. *Teleport* will send you in the direction of your reticle a good distance and it can be used in a horizontal or vertical fashion.

**Water Mage Spec**

[Here](http://imgur.com/GAGsNQm) is my current spec. The reason for no swimming or boating is because I don't care for Ocean biomes so when I run into them I just turn the other way. Spec is only really important in the early game

* Focus on combat skills in a manner of *Mana Shied* &gt; *Healing Stream* &gt; *Pet Health*.
* I dumped a huge amount of points into *Mana Shield* in early levels because it seems to be the better combat ability.
* Don't feel the need to get *Teleport* early on because it won't really help your combat abilities all that much.
* Like I said above wait a while before you spec into anything travel related because it will hinder your combat efficiency in the early game.
* I recommend *Riding* over *Hang Gliding* because *Pet Health* &gt; *Climbing*.

**Water Mage Combat Strategy**

* *Puddle Effect* - Make full use of the puddle mechanic the self heals might seem small

* *Pre-Shield* - When approaching a difficult mob or group of mobs I will cast *Mana Sheild* and then wait for the cooldown to come up before engaging. This allows me to use another *Mana Shield* as soon as that first one falls off. Also whenever you are in combat you should always use *Mana Shield* when it comes off cool down

* *Son-of-a-Witch* - My strategy for taking down witches/wizards (and most difficult encounters) is to use a Pre-Shield

* *+4 Melee Bosses* - Some Melee bosses tend to just crit you for three times your health. The way I deal with this is to never let the boss hit me. This is done by kiting the boss in a linear fashion by teleporting past the boss, then run for a bit, then turn 180 and use teleport. Use all your mana for *Mouse 2* for the stun. (This will buy you extra DPS time.) I'd recommend just using health potions rather than using mana from *Healing Stream*, if you do manage to get hit and not one shot.

* *+4 Range Bosses* - For difficulty boss fights that involve a heavy hitting range mob I tend to use Athene's PvP Strat. For those not familiar basically just find a column of some kind and continuously LoS. Spam *Mouse 2* then go back to LoS'ing until you get back to full mana. Also use Pre-Shielding and Heal if you get knocked down or hurt some how.

**Conclusion**

I feel like the game kinda plays backwards in that the level 1-20 is the hardest. Now at level 100 I nearly one shot everything and leveling is going much faster. The only challenge now is +4 dungeons.

Thanks for reading let me know strategies you use and why. Don't reply ""LOL that's stupid I spent 40 points in hang gliding before I even got a pet."". Let me know why you did that. Did having a hang glider enable you to kite better? Do you feel like having a pet just got in the way? Be constructive please.

##What is the ""Grid"" and what is generated on it?
***

The Grid is, **Dungeons**, **Portals**, and **Overworld Missions** (all of which will be simplified collectively as ""Locations"") are created. When these lines intersect, a location is generated. Without any context, take a look at **[this](http://i.imgur.com/ywy64fch.jpg)** to see what the grid looks like. After reading this post, it will hopefully make sense!

**The Grid is a guideline for you to travel along if you are hoping to discover more locations and can be useful when attempting to find portals in already-explored regions that you are no longer near.**

***
##Limitations of this post
***

Ultimately I can not do much about bringing in more data on my own. It takes time to explore, even between the grid spaces.

Also

If you would like to contribute to this project, the data is only valuable if the data was NOT marked as a mission location. Missions convert dungeons to the player's level rather than the generated level.

Source of the 90% explored region: [link](http://imgur.com/BrcK80m)

***
##Creating a Grid Guideline
***

The Grid is generated along cardinal directions (North, &amp; West). Each location is generated either within a chunk on in a merged section of chunks. Chunks are the squares you see on your map in the game.

The trick is to identify the spacing between each mark on the grid. So

Also

Now that we have the first intersection and guidelines

(Not 100% to scale on chunks as you'll see in a bit

Each intersection is a potential dungeon. If you do not find a dungeon

This [album](http://imgur.com/a/PEg9a) can be helpful for people who want a bit more on generating the grid with the commentary of learning about it as I traveled it.

**Traveling the grid is as easy as following a cardinal direction from a location until you reach a new location.**

***
##What is plvl?
***

plvl, check out the **[wiki](http://wiki.cubeworldforum.org/index.php?title=Level)**.

(This is partly speculation) If your character is plvl 55

Locations typically spawn with enemies at a set plvl, 30-40, 90-100... etc) but there are still a few very niche ones that fill in for about 5 plvls (most common in later is 96-100, but I've seen a 77-82).

In addition to plvl

* +1 = Green quality

* +2 = Blue quality

* +3 = Purple quality

* +4 = Yellow quality

Elite enemies only spawn in Dungeon locations generated along the grid

Overworld Missions are set to a specific level. For example

***
##How to find a location relative to your level
***

Unfortunately I do not yet have a definitive method to do this. I can

* Low level dungeons will ALWAYS spawn near the town. Some may also spawn out further

* Overworld mission locations favor spawning on the outskirts of a region and can be in large patches near each other. Occasionally they will spawn within the first extended radius of a town (see Seed 43110 in link below)

* Portals tend to favor spawning on the outer rim of a region (but not always. see Seed 101010 in the link below)

The first page on **[this workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqEJC1GHyz7ddEtjaFhPWktJallRZW5UNGNUcWNkZVE&amp;usp=sharing)** shows examples of how a location can be branched out. The individual seed sheets show location generation on the grid along with plvl information.

***
##How to find portals

Portals spawn along the grid just like everything else

I'll defer you to an earlier album I put together found **[here](http://imgur.com/a/TasGB)**

The most important thing to remember: Portals do not show up on the map unless you zoom in enough to see them. You can view them from any angle/tilt of the map so long as you are zoomed in enough

I plan to add more to it in the future as I have time to explore. Now that my warrior can handle it

##Predictions
***

I'll preface this with the disclaimer that I have no idea what will/will not be ultimately added to the game. This is mostly just informed guessing based on what exists and what has been mentioned by Wollay.

* **Portal generation will be adjusted in the future.** In their current form

* **Overworld missions will begin to scale in level.** The current format is fine for plvl 1 - 50

* **Boss health and AI will be finely tuned in future updates.** After killing every boss in every dungeon I've gone through, but a Human Rogue plvl 88 took about 6 minutes. And this isn't just as a result of having to kite / heal / dodge more or not -- My smash crits for about 2200 on both. On the plvl 94 Orc, it did about 6% of its HP in damage. On the plvl 88 Human it did about 2%. And I'm just hopeful the AI is developed to make combat more interesting than stun-and-run.

* **CPU usage and Blue Fog will be optimized in the future.** This is a given

* **The grid will remain in all future updates.** For an infinitely expanding world to work, you'll see that there always seems to be a higher level dungeon directly connected to a town that can leave players with a bad taste in their mouth.

* **Random packs of enemies/creatures off the grid will scale in level, but I'm not sure what the design intent is there. I am pretty sure the design intent is to put tougher mobs further out from the city, though.

* **Ocean and Lava regions will be revisited in the future and have different/new/updated Dungeons added.** Wollay has already gone on the record to say he plans to add underwater content in the future (looking at you, castles and stuff that have the potential to look awesome there.

* **Level scaling will stay relatively the same, there's still going to be 1-1 dungeons. Same goes to my earlier prediction about random packs receiving some scaling. Skull Bulls will still always be above plvl 70 (clvl 46). Sheep will always be below plvl 20 (clvl 6).

I've seen a lot of new people just learning about the game now joining the subreddit

Most of the information in this post came straight from the website.  Much of it is direct quotes or paraphrasing.  This is a *zero speculation* post.  If you see any errors in the content or spelling (this was all typed manually)

------------------------------------------------

**CUBE WORLD**

**Pricing**
&gt;* The Alpha Version will be available at a lower price than the Beta version and the Final version.
* Updates will be released regularly.
* Updates are free.

**System Requirements**
&gt;* **OS**: Windows XP SP2, and 8
* **CPU**: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz
* **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce 7800
* **RAM**: 2GB
* An Internet Connection is required for Updates and Online Multiplayer

**The World**
&gt;* Landscapes are generated procedurally using math and random numbers.
* The World Map is a zoomable
* Seeds can be used to make the same exact world again.
* Worlds are generated during gameplay.  This means no long precomputations or large save files when the world is initially created.
* There are no artificial borders.
* There are multiple climates and themes including: Greenlands, Jungles, Lava Lands, and Oceans.
* Common areas are now called ""Lands of ..."" ^[[Source]](https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/264674626536366080)
* Special quest areas of names like ""X Mountains"" ^[[Source]](https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/264674626536366080)
* Some special land names also depend on climate. ^[[Source]](https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/264675227647213568)

**Adventure**
&gt;* Five major adventuring skills include: Climbing, Hang Gliding, and Sailing.
* There are Dungeons integrated seamlessly into the world. These are full of rare loot
* Different types of Dungeons include: Castles, Pyramids, and Catacombs.
* There are also Overworld Dungeons
* Portals can be found in the world
* Everyday in Cube World
* Because new missions are made available everyday
* Mission rewards include: Weapons
* Platinum Coins are used to upgrade Weapons and Armor.

**Classes**
&gt;* There are four main classes: Warriors, and Rogues.
* **Warriors** use charged attacks (building up MP with normal attacks to charge up powerful special attacks).  They are heavily armored melee fighters, and shields.  [[Click here for even more details on the Warrior class]](https://picroma.com/blog/post/2)
* **Rangers** similarly to Warriors use charged attacks, and boomerangs.
* **Mages** cast spells that have varying cast times.  Normal attacks are faster, and bracelets that can attack enemies, heal allies, and protect themselves.
* **Rogues** are more fast paced and the special attacks are instant.  They are agile melee fighters that focus on stealth and evasion.  They wield daggers

**Class Specializations**
&gt;* Each major class has two specializations that change playstyle and the abilities of that class.
* Specialization can be changed at the class trainer.
* **Warriors** can specialize into:
* *Berserker*: Attack speed increases with each hit.  Attacks charge more quickly.
* *Guardian*: Can block attacks with all weapons.  Has increased health.  Can become immune against stun attacks.
* **Rangers** can specialize into:
* *Sniper*: Has camoflauge and aim abilities.  Attack speed increases with each hit.
* *Scout*: Special attacks have a chance to become instantly chargeable.  Can sprint.
* **Mages** can specialize into:
* *Fire*: Special attacks have a chance to become instantly chargeable.  Can cast fire explosions.
* *Water*: Attack speed is increased with each hit.  Has healing spells.
* **Rogues** can specialize into:
* *Assassin*: Special attacks increase stealth.  Has improved stealth abilities.
* *Ninja*: Dodges during special attacks.  Can throw shurikens.

**Skills and Progression**
&gt;* With each gained level
* There are both class specific skills (attacks / spells) and common skills (adventure skills).
* Your character's progression is infinite.  You can level up infinitely and put infinitely many skill points into skill trees.
* This does not mean you become infinitely powerful.
* The power of players, and skills don't scale linearly or exponentially, but rather tangentially.
* So while levels can be between one and infinity
* In lower levels
* For each world
* The advantages to this are: no level cap

**Combat**
&gt;* Based on player skill
* Skilled players can beat high level monsters
* **Manual Aiming** means enemies must be targeted manually with the crosshair.  There is no target locking in melee or ranged combat.
* **Active Dodging** means that most attacks can be dodged with good reaction and proper timing.  Dodging will cost stamina and makes you immune to damage for a short amount of time.  Skilled players can avoid damage regardless of the strength of the opponent.
* All creatures have armor (decreases physical damage) and resistance (decreases magic damage).
* **Combos** mean that every successive time you hit an opponent
* Special attacks have a chance to stun opponents.  Stunned enemies are easy to hit

**Races**
&gt;* There are currently eight playable races including: Elves, Lizardmen, Dwarves, Orcs, Frogmen, and Undeads.
* There are separate models for males and females.
* They have different voices.
* There are no class-race restrictions.
* Characters are customizable during character creation by choosing a combination of face
* Lizardmen have scales rather than hair and Frogmen have different eyes.

**Pets**
&gt;* Players can have a pet accompany them on their journeys and assist in combat.
* Players can have as many pets as they want
* Remaining pets are stored in a special pet bag in the inventory.
* Most animals and some monsters can be tamed.
* In order to tame a pet
* There are five major pet categories: Melee, Healer, and Mount.
* **Melee Pets** are the most common and attack from close range.
* **Ranged Pets** shoot bullets from a distance.
* **Tank Pets** deal less damage but have high endurance and generate more aggro.
* **Healer Pets** have healing abilities that can heal the player and friends.
* **Mount Pets** are ridable and enable fast traveling.

**Monsters**
&gt;* Common monsters include: Slimes, Skeletons, Vampires, Werewolves, and many more.
* Boss monsters are the strongest creatures in the game.
* Defeating a boss monster requires lots of skill and experience.  Players need to study their attacks and react properly.
* Defeating a boss monster gives valuable rewards including: rare weapons
* Some bosses are: Trolls, Cyclops, Saurian, Mammoth, Lich, Golem, Ember Golem, and Hell Demon.

**Items and Crafting**
&gt;* Items can be obtained from: enemies, and vendors.
* Items can be crafted from: Weapon crafting, Cooking, and Alchemy.  Many crafts require recipes and ingredients.
* **Weapon Crafting**: Each class can craft weapons available to that class.
* **Armor Crafting**: Each class can craft armor available to that class.
* **Jewel Crafting**: All classes can craft rings and amulets.  These have secondary stats that are useful for all classes.
* **Cooking**: Players can craft food for cheap out-of-combat healing or buffs.
* **Alchemy**: Players can craft healing potions and other useful potions.

**Weapon Customization**
&gt;* Weapons can be upgraded and customized on a per-voxel basis.
* As an example
* **Spirit Cubes** are rare magic cubes that are obtained by defeating bosses.  They are more powerful than normal cubes and have additional effects when placed on a weapon.
* Spirit Cubes have four potential effects: Fire, and Unholy.
* **Fire** spirit deals additional fire damage.
* **Wind** spirit increases attack and movement speed of the player.
* **Ice** spirit slows attack and movement speed of the target.
* **Unholy** spirit deals damage to the target and heals the player.

**Multiplayer**
&gt;* Multiplayer is optional and the game can be played completely offline.
* A separate server application will be released that can be used to host multiplayer games.
* It can run on dedicated servers or private computers (requires port forwarding).
* It enables online and LAN multiplayer for up to **four** players.
* Multiplayer game difficulty is still being experimented with.
* The max player limit is still being experimented with.",self,t5_2t4bs,1371069708.0,,OldMan,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1g0yvn/everything_you_need_to_know_about_cube_world/

——————————

So, so lets get down to... *SEAR*-ious business!    
- **You're Not Doing Yourself Any Favors**: Unfortunately, while yours is an annoyance. That said, I find fire to be *INFINITELY* more fun to play, which trumps any min/maxing.     
    
- **Ding! Oven's Pre-Heated (Fire Spark)**: Fire Mages unique passive, since any additional procs are wasted while it's up. It's also useful as a quick stun that can be fired between dodges (I.E. dodge -&gt; fire -&gt; dodge).  
    
- **(Don't) Let Me Stand Next To Your FIRRRRE (Explosion)**: Hendrix FTW. Along with Fire Spark, making it usable to chain stun enemies. This can be cast while running/jumping and should be used anytime you need to get someone away from you. It can also be used offensively by pushing a group into a wall, bunching them up for easy AE melting.   
    
- **Don't Stand In The Fire!! (Mobility)**: Standing still is for those fat, teleporting, and mana shielding whenever you can to avoid taking damage. Combine this with explosion, or insta-cast M2s, and you'll be dropping groups without breaking a sweat. For best results, combine this technique with...    
        
- **Too Hot To Handle (Using Line of Sight)**: Ranger/Mages got you down? Go hide behind a wall. If they can't see you
    
- **Bringing The Heat! (Gear/Pet Choices)**: For gear, especially if you wanna use staff. As for weapons, check out the breakdowns below. I personally recommend carrying bracelets or wands for soloing and staff for grouping. 
-----*Bracelets*: Single-shot M1 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; M2. This is my personal preference for soloing. The pros lie in their mobility. Each attack fires super quick and is easy to weave in between dodges. The DPS is probably the lowest, these are just fun, for me at least. One major drawback for bracelets though is the fact that they are dual wielded, meaning you need two of them to drop to be useful. Makes upgrading to better damage a pain in the ass.      
-----*Wands*: Single-shot M1, not as powerful as staves. All-in-all a decent choice, especially if you tend to lag, since M2 can be moved while being fired, so much so that you can hit/stun targets that are far apart by swinging the mouse after first shot is fired. Another note, each shot can crit independently and even hit a target that dodges (they try to dodge first shot and end up getting hit by the last shot). That said I found two drawbacks; you have to lead targets with M2 if they are moving perpendicular to you and I have yet to find a wand that doesn't look down-right stupid...    
-----*Staves*: Ground-targeted Tornado M1 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; M2. Staves are a skill-check weapon, or you drop a proc'd M2 on top of a M1. To add to this damage, staves are very good at quickly building combo streaks, which makes it a great choice for fights that would take longer (bosses, high HP targets, etc.). It's not all love, though. Spells are slow to cast and dodging will cancel M2 even after it's been fully cast. Add to this the fact that since tornados are ground targeted, since you gotta aim for where your enemy will be
  
As for pets, and can stun. If you want a ranged, Spitter is best, Snout Beetle is okay. Pet won't make a huge difference, so you are free to roll with whatever, but min/maxers want dat turtle.    

- **Sparkin' It Up (Early Levels)**: When leveling
---*L1-3:* Points go into Explosion to unlock Mana Shield. Mana Shield is an amazing survival skill and is definitely your first priority. Points in Explosion also benefit survivability through better CC options. 
---*L4-6:* Points go into either Pet HP for Riding skill or Climbing for Hang Gliding. This is down to personal preference
---*L7-9:* Points go into Mana Shield to unlock Teleport. Teleport is another survival skill
---*L10+:* I'd say pump up Mana Shield, since by now, you're probably hiking a ways to get to next dungeons. The higher level you get, the less useful points are, so at this point you can't go wrong, do what ya want. If you want a boat, go nuts!    
        
- **Playing With Fire (Last Tip)**: This is, its a new game, and even though we might be ""gimped"" in comparison to water mages, at the end of the day it comes down to what you like doing. I found Water Mages to be painfully boring, YMMV. With advanced skill trees coming, we'll probably be seeing a lot of changes, so for now

1)  Download the Crossover trial (Or full version if you have it) from here: [linky](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/)  
2)  Download the .tie file from here:  [linky](http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=11886)  
3)  Double click the .tie file / open it in crossover
4)  In crossover go to ""Programs &gt; Run Command"" and type ""regedit"" and launch that  
5)  Navigate to ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; software &gt; Wine"" and right click &gt; new ""key""
6)  Close out regedit

If I've missed anything please let me know

I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do

**Rogues**

I've noticed a neat little trick with the rogue's Ninja specialization. Namely

This gives you a nice height boost, you will regenerate stamina, increasing overall glide time significantly.

As well as this, you can get a hit on them from afar, and continue gliding, allowing you to gather experience without ever touching ground and ever losing any speed.  

I've currently only tested this with my brand new rogue (Edit: 25 in 3rd ability, primarily due to the restored stamina. 

I'll note that the rogue's second ability can also be used to restore stamina, due to rapid dropping in use. However, if done quickly, it seems to give a slight bit more than used, and will give you a bit of extra distance due to the rapid forward dash.

**Mage**

Only a quick note here, (and assuming it does not hit any blocks in its range), will teleport you to the closest block below you at the end of the abilities range. What does this mean? It means that if you're a million miles up in the air, about to fall to your death, you can teleport and appear safely on the ground with no fall damage! 

**General**

Just a quick explanation of the more common methods of longer gliding.

*Ranger Retreat Gliding*

Face away from the place you wish to go, and you'll fly extremely fast. Note that this is a momentum effect, and turning/changing direction will be extremely awkward. Also of note is that while using this bug, you will actually *rise* when holding space, rather than just maintaining altitude.

*Infinite Flight*

Mid-glide, though you will be unable to control your movement, and after a short time, your glider will start to waver, turn, stop, or otherwise move oddly. Press enter again to end this glitch

*TO THE MOON!*

The combination of the above two. You will rise forever. 

*Bomb Flight*

Using any bomb (preferably one of a lower level, stand in front of it, and start gliding just as it explodes.

*Prat Fall (Or

If you fall off a cliff, though, as it never seems to work for me when doing this from a glide.

**First download this:**

[MSI Afterbruner.](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm)

Afterburner has an FPS limiter and also some other tools like temp/fps/v-memory etc. It should work for Nvidia and AMD cards

**Limiting the FPS:**


1. Once you install the program

2. Click on the tray icon to open this screen

3. After you open the settings menu there will be some tabs at the top


**Some NVIDIA Tips:** If you are going to enable v-sync and find yourself with bad input lag I found that enabling triple-buffering and v-sync in NVIDIA Control Panel aswell as limiting the FPS to 59 instead of 60 (if your monitor is 60hz

• This game isn't difficult. Don't get me wrong, either I go to attack something and I don't make it, in which case I either die and respawn five secounds away, or I manage to murder him and move on.
  
EDIT: To clarify, there's no punishment for not killing them, and there's not real point in killing them. ( Usually, the reward of killing a really difficult guy is not very different from the way easier. )
  
• The graphics are beautiful
&amp;nbsp;
  
And here are my own thoughts on the game;
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
• For an alpha
  
• Weapon customization is very well done and enjoyable. I've spent a lot of time working on a few great weapons to make them look better
  
• The most annoying part of the game is the menus. The inventory, ETC. These all have quite a few flaws, you can't walk with the menus up, for example.  
  
• Infinite leveling is not a good idea ***in my opinion***, but you slowly stop gaining power for it, which is annoying.    
  
• This game is very ""grind-ish"", and yet it makes you only see the good and exciting moments.    
  
• There's a lot of travelling. Of the time I've been playing, meaning that it's not strictly boring to fly around. Just not very enjoyable either.    
  
• Riding/Swimming/Sailing seem like pretty bad skills to me. Riding is pretty much crap when compared to hang gliding
  
• Different biomes are brilliant. It mostly doesn't really change anything at all

My friends were not having this problem. We were all connected to my server

After several attempts to fix the problem using everything I found on here and other forums

What I did was use a program called Defraggler and did a check on the Cube World folder. (right click folder and select defraggler, but that was on the ocean traveling at 200% speed. the loading screen only lasted maybe 1-3 seconds, rather than 10+ seconds.

This helped my game so I do not know if it will work for others.

I think you might be wondering why I brought up the full price and I felt like Minecraft was a first of its kind and not comparing Cube World to Minecraft but saying as a lot of people had no clue what Minecraft was till down the road. Where Cube World would not benefit as much if it went cheaper now and expensive down the road since I think most of us are locked into buying it at full price no matter what.

* **Hang Gliding:** 50 points -&gt; 400% speed

* **Swimming:** 40 points -&gt; 90% speed

* **Sailing:** 50 points -&gt; 350% speed 

**TOTAL:** 239 points -&gt; Level 120

Once you reach these levels, I'd suggest climbing.

For a rogue (ninja):

* **Intercept:** 50 points -&gt; 10 second cooldown

* **Sneak:** 40 points -&gt; 32% speed

* **Shuriken:** 25 points -&gt; 10 second cooldown

**TOTAL:** 120 -&gt; Level 60

If you drop 50 points into Shuriken

A level 180 rogue (ninja) Will have all skills at a very high level and a Power level of 91. Anything past this point is largely unnecessary. The claim of infinite leveling in this game is genuine but only technically. Once you reach these levels

I'm not really a fan of the anti-exponential formulae used to make this game ""infinite"". I think there are probably better ways to go about it. I guess we'll have to wait and see what else Wollay adds~

I figured a lot of us are probably playing on this seed

I've started a simple map of what I've found so far: http://imgur.com/8yzhtyY

Other points of interest:

* The Thaldar Mountains are by far the most rich in ore mountains ive come across. I maxed out on iron in about 5 minutes. And there was easily at least 10 emerald deposits

* To the west of Spawn Point is the desert area. Its not the map because I haven't actually gone there yet. Someone else using the seed told me about it.


Hope you all can add more cool things to find!

As mentioned, a backup worlds tab, a task scheduler, and plugin support (plugins will be coded in C# or VB using a small dll).

Our website is built off a lobby system where you can communicate with those that you have accepted to join your party.
We have built an awesome notification system to keep you up to date with all group related actions. Everyone also gets a profile which keeps track of
each users connection history and reputation. This allows for group leaders to keep tabs on those making incoming group requests. With all the features currently
complete and all those to come
but all these awesome addons wouldn't be possible without it!

We are just releasing this so there may not be any listings but we hope that it will catch on and provide an awesome location to find people to play with!
It is bound to have bugs so please bare with us while we continue to improve it.  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

• [Entertainment] I do understand all of you are unhappy with the amount of updates wollay &amp; pixxie are putting out every now and then. I myself do tend to get a little bored when playing cube world cause, more classes, more races, etc.

• [Bugs] Yes of course their is bugs. This game is labeled (Alpha) for a reason. Alpha is the start of a game. When you create something

• [Cheaters] There is many many many cheaters. That's okay cause all that does it help wollay and pixxie block off the exploits to change code with Cheat Engine
There is going to be quite a few for a while. Its like wollay and pixxie are building a castle and the cheaters just so happen to find a way to get into it without being caught.

• [Waste of Money?] Nobody told you to buy this game right now, I am sure that at full game release this games price will go up. You won't regret that will you, but you regret buying it now. No it's not a waste you actually save money. Minecraft was fun althrough its stages. You really would have started playing it last year? Gees. 

• [Communication] I also agree with all of you saying you wish for more communication. I also wish for the same thing. Wollay &amp; Pixxie both have twitters. @Wol_lay @Pix_xie. Follow them for latest news updates. I do believe it is a sign of greed (somewhat) that they refuse to have anybody else work on their team. As of right now they need all of the support they can get

I have been leveling various classes
Bottom line is that I feel spirit cubes are ""Practically"" being too weak
that you need 100+ hit combos to properly trigger a noticable effect.

I've tried it with +97 spirit cubes (16) on a Staff. That being said
a +50 hit combo to make myself heal for about 20 per right-click (about 2 per tick)
and a mind-whopping 1000 hit combo on a single dummy for it to tick for 20 per hit. So

Undead spirits for instance should be allowed to crit-heal, so that the damage is noticeable. 

Also, not a linear build-up. Much like the power-level you could say, gain a lot at the start, then let it flatten out at the end.

It is a free-time activity after all and that is what it should stay like. For that very reason applicants are not chosen by the time they have available

For this Subreddit I follow a policy to provide an open and neutral discussion platform for everything related to Cube World. That is the reason, even though it might be another thread about a topic discussed several times already.

As all current Moderators, but executed by a single Mod. If something goes wrong, I will fix it so that it fits to the policy explained above. That is part of the learning process and will not result in a demotion.

The only thing I expect from my Moderators is to check reported posts and posts which are stuck in the spam filter. Everything else is optional.

_

In order to apply as a Moderator respond to this thread with an informal application. There are no guidelines or a minimum of text required. Every reply

Deadline is in a week on the 16. of July. I will check the applications on the 17. though

That is all, I hope to find 4 People, but if I won't receive approval by the Mod team for 4 applicants then it will be less.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hxxql/rcubeworld_is_looking_for_up_to_4_new_moderators/

Been playing with my girl and I gotta say

I honestly wouldn't have been turned onto the game at first

So we gave it a shot together. I've never played the game solo

We're pretty busy with all the crap going on in our lives so we've only been able to play a few hours so far

For her it has:

* Cute Art Style
* Taming Pets
* Fun Exploring
* Engaging

For me it has:

* Challenging Enemies (I'm always biting off more than I can chew lol)
* MMO style skill Trees and gear customization
* 3rd person Shooter type action with Mage
* Healing role with mage - can I keep myself and my woman alive even when we fight stronger enemies?

Completely worth the purchase price of this alpha - especially knowing that I'm locked in for future updates

(there's a super cool pokemon mod out now

Anyways. Thats all I wanted to say I guess.

I'm back with more Cheat Engine shenanigans! Instead of talking about power like I promised last post

Anyways, or in general other mobs/bosses, are also not included in this formula. This only applies to your character with empty equipment slots.

Without further ado

    base_health = scaling_factor * class_coefficient * 2^(3 * (level - 1)/(level + 19) + 1)

Where scaling factor is always 100.0 and class_coefficient one of the following:

    class_coefficient = 1.00 for mages
    class_coefficient = 1.10 for rangers
    class_coefficient = 1.20 for rogues
    class_coefficient = 1.30 for warriors

Keep in mind that guardians get an extra 25% health!

*Full disclosure: this expression is already simplified

Now to the fun part: plots! If we plot the above function for all the classes

[Health in function of the level

The topmost curve is the health of a warrior character with the guardian bonus, a ranger and a mage character.

If you want to change your health without touching your level

Next stop: the power, regeneration and critical stats. And the stats of the class skills of course!

Again

* **Skills drop** - Not a typo, IE crypt bosses have a higher chance of dropping 'Raise dead' which would allow you to resurrect any ally that dies before he disintegrates entirely (with so much health depending on the power level of skill).


* **Olympus Temples** - As the title suggests

* **[More] Classes** - Coming from a background of things like Dark Souls / Elder Scrolls / Dragons Dogma / Monster Hunter. Would like to see some hybrid or unique classes. He [Wollay] has on picroma that more classes / races were a planned feature. So might as well throw my hat into the arena. **Necros** A Personal favorite, with the ability to raise any of the major role pets (Healer, Tank, Range) depending on the situation. On their *Death* side they would be more or less a 'true' melee mage (or a more dps version or the Mystic Knight from Dragons Dogma). **Magic Archer** This come directly from Dragons Dogma (my current favorite game), you are able to target multiple enemies with magic arrows, though they don't do as much damage as normal arrows, they can AOE better than a standard archer. **Paladin** suggested over and over

* **Map Markers** - Simple, text flags cost 20 copper each.

* **Road Vendors** - Simple (again)

* **Flares** After watching hours of footage

* **Utility Scrolls** These would be 1 time use 'spells' sold by vendors for massive amount of money, no one ever spend any real amounts of money. Having a money sink would be nice, the scrolls themselves would provide things like *rewind* which makes the sun rise again but not reset the time (for running towards a distant objective). *Portal* (again ripped from Dragons Dogma) where you can buy a portal stone (for &gt;20s) which can be put anywhere, but using a portal scroll burns the scroll. You can relocate the portal stone, that way you can put a stone outside a dungeon (inside would have a buffer zone), run back to town for supplies than burn a scroll and return to the stone.

* **Hunts** Another way to burn money

I am fairly new to reddit (posting anyway) so i'm sure most of these have been brought up. But i'm burning  time between @wol_lay refreshes. Sorry for any crappy formatting

Updating: Without a demo release all my idle thoughts while working turn to CubeWorld, forgive my formatting.

* **Town Hero [Gabe_b]** &gt; Becoming a **Town Hero**. Once you've done enough quests for a town they make a statue of you in the town square (effectively just your character model at the time you trigger the metaquest with all colors shifted to grey) and you get discounts at the shops. Also

* **Abyss Dungeons** - Pure dark dungeons, the defining feature would be the fact the boss would roam the halls at random, he would be invincible until you reached his chambers and broke his 'spirit link' where he would become vulnerable. Upon his death the maze would become lit, allowing you to see if you managed to avoid any potential pitfalls and the like *Andro30 gave me the inspiration*

* **Boat and Glider Customization [innadril &amp; Vanto]** - Pretty straightforward

* **Ships** - This could be handled in a lot of different ways **Player owned** Simply put a massive ship which, but would allow you have a 'home' of sorts, especially if oceans become larger or breathing apparatuses become a thing. Such as able to store 'tanks' on the ship if your spelunking underwater, you'll need a home base if there is no land in site to refuel. **NPC Owned** If you ever played FFXI this should be familiar, you pay to board a ship, which has a given port it travels too, while it's in transport, during which you can fish or chill

* **Destroyed towns** - A dynamic or random event, hell-portal, etc) and the surrounding area of the village is now higher level. This would let previously low level areas to now be interesting to re-visit.  Could be themed, like crypt theme makes it night time in the surrounding area and all the trees are dead. Hell themed would make surrounding area into lava lands, however the difference is that your seeing the transformation, trees+town are burning. etc etc  

* **Aesthetic rare items** Inspired by **Zantrix** and other games. But either legendary weapons in the vain of GuildWars 2, this one is straight forward, but with CW's ability to add cube by cube, you could color each cube, which would allow crazy amount of customization, especially to creative people. Dyes would only be drops, and once 'consumed' are endless (pretty much ripped from GW2).   Hyper-rare dyes would add 'auras' around you, glow, Lizardmen would drop forest green)",t5_2t4bs

Q: Is it still possible to play Cube World with an Xbox controller?

A: Yes

Q: Huh? Why dungeons? What the problem with that?

A: 10 players

Q: You say the higher cap servers will be for PVP like CTF or DM. How then there is no higher cap for pve? Limited pvp maps?

1373466433.0,1i0bjb,Autorun [AutoHotkey script],ThirdSeason337,33,6,22,"Posted this on cubeworldforum.org but thought I'd post it here as well.

It's an AutoHotkey script that toggles autorun using the forward mouse button:
http://pastebin.com/0Q7bWZd8

Note: I didn't fully write this script. I pieced it together from parts that I googled and then changed a few things.

Things it does:

- Toggles on/off autorun using the foward mouse button.

- ""w"" key turns off autorun like it would in many other games and acts like normal.

- ""s"" key also turns off autorun and acts like normal.

- If you enter chat mode

- ""Pause"" key suspends the hotkeys if needed for whatever reason. You can remove this if you want.

- The script only works while Cube.exe is the active window.
  


If you want the toggle to be something else

The backtick/tilde key may be a good choice
You would just need to change ""XButton2::"" to ""`::"" as such: http://pastebin.com/s82cnV7R

You can't start the autorun if you are holding down the ""w"" key. Not sure how to get around that but I may look into it later.

 
Also

That being said

 
If you don't have AutoHokey and/or don't know how to use it:

1. Downlaod it here: http://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Install it.
3. Copy/paste the script from the pastebin above into a new notepad document.
4. Save the document with "".ahk"" as the extension
5. Go to wherever you saved the script and then double-click it.

If anyone has a better autorun script or knows how to get this one to work while the ""w"" key is held down and then released

EDIT: Changed the ""~w::"" part of the script. It was causing the toggle key not to work on the next press if you accidentally pressed it while holding the ""w"" key before. It wasn't doing this when using ""XButton2"" as the toggle

(09 July 2013)

Original post:

I had suggested the other day that we should run an omnibus Mac support thread to reduce the likelihood of duplicate ""Does X solution work?"" and ""how well does it work on Y?"" threads. Not seeing any in the New stream, I receive no sweet, sweet karma for this, so I'd encourage upvotes for visibility). If this ends up being a duplicate by the time I'm done, let me know and I'll delete it.

I propose formatting comments for minimum clutter: just indicate demo or alpha, Bootcamp, Crossover, Parallels, VMWare, etc), what Windows version you're using (XP/Vista/7/8) and results (doesn't work/works + framerate or performance).

For example:

* CubeWorld Demo
* Retina MacBook Pro (mid-2012)
* CrossOver
* WinXP and Vista
* Does not work: Error: ""Unable to initialize XAudio2"".


**UPDATE: 08 July 2013**
So this thread has calmed down since the release

As a number of other people have noted (and I can confirm), or Crossover - they seem to fail at updating and don't allow me to fully install the game, and I never get to a title screen. I've also tried copying over my install from my PC to run in a folder, with no success.

Some folks are reporting mixed success with Parallels

I saw an older post where people complained of input lag, etc. A lot of these people, and I, have great rigs, that run without issue on maximum settings, which led to my investigation as to what was plaguing me with the inability to do anything unless I was standing still for long periods.

Anyways, though it was only about 5-15 seconds usually. One time while I was waiting for my chat to open, I popped up the steam overlay to send a message to my friend I was playing with because hey, it would be faster to say what I needed to that way. But when I opened the overlay, the message box filled with w's and whatnot from my in game movement, leading me to conclude the keyboard was spamming the game and it bugged out the menus and whatnot. So here's what I did:

Go  into your keyboard settings and lower the key repeat rates, but some people might want to give that a go if they want literally zero key repeats on their computer. Anyways, if the speed to repeat keys (like if you want to hold down a to say aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh) is set really high, it will spam the game with these key inputs and lag out your menus and chat. Lowering these to a more basic level should more than likely fix your issues. It did for me, anyways, and I hope it works for you.",,self,,

1373298998.0,1hvbq2,Idea to make Cubeworld the most expansive RPG ever.,kleep,45,17,28,"(Xpost from /r/Games)

2 people made Cubeworld.

2 human beings. 2 created this entire game.

I got high earlier and as I was playing the game.. this simple idea made my stoned mind quiver.

My problem with minecraft (which I've posted [about](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/ko41a/what_minecraft_could_be_if_notch_truly_embraced/) and changed my mind about haha

Cubeworld is beautiful

So what we have with Cubeworld is a beautiful engine, and currently they have some plans to add a few more things.

My suggestion is for the makers to create a steam workshop-like system in the game

Another difference with the workshop (and more like TF2's community patch system) is that once a mod/gets popular or the creators of the game like it enough

What this system enables the game to become is something immaculate. 1000's of mobs? New worlds? Tons of spells? Custom castles? Towns? Quests?

The makers of the game could continue forward for years

The only thing would be compensation or lack thereof, that'd be great to.

Ideas? Thoughts?

I have a NVIDIA video card built in to my laptop, with an average around 70).

I don't think every control panel is the same, go to manage 3d settings, on program settings click add then navigate to where you found cube.exe, and on the drop down chose the nvidia processor. After you apply the change(s), you'll notice a great performance increase in your game. This also worked with minecraft and tekkit, by finding Java.exe, and giving that the ability to run on the video card. 

http://imgur.com/a/s3RZw These pictures go with the paragraph there

If you're not sure where your cube.exe is though, right click cube.exe (it has to be running for it to show up of course) and do ""open file location"". You can either remember the path yourself, or I'm sure you can copy it to your clipboard.

This is a beginner's guide for forwarding ports.

-----

So I bought Cube World a few days ago, it's pretty easy. I thought I'd make a simple guide for everyone to help you get one set up too!

-----

**1.** Open up your command prompt. Enter *ipconfig* into the prompt and you will receive [a list of information regarding your IP address](http://i.imgur.com/jphxoro.png). What you're looking for is your **Default Gateway**

**2.** Open up your browser and put that IP into your address bar. This will take you to your router settings. You will probably get prompted to enter a name and password. Unless it's been changed manually

**3.** You'll need to click **Add**. This is where you'll open the port on your computer to allow people to connect to your server. Name your port option and enter **PORT 12345. AGAIN, which in the picture is *192.168.1.2*. Save your new port and exit your router settings. 

**4.** Now you need to start your server up. First

**5.** Now we need to make sure that your port was forwarded correctly. Go to http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ and enter **12345** into the Port box and click *Check* If it's open

**6.** Now you can have your friends connect and play! If you're all on a LAN, will use this IP to connect to the server. If you have a friend online wanting to connect, you would use the IP found on http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ and send it to them.

-----

I hope this helps everyone! Happy hunting!

-----

/u/Rivius says:
&gt;You can also use your external IP to connect to rather than the internal (LAN) IP.

&gt;If you have several devices that use the router

Seed: 43110

If you want to contribute to this

**THE THEORY:** Dungeons spawn in a cardinal direction

**THE EXTRA:** The other point of this project is to determine how plvl and +value are done for each landscape. Understanding this will help players have a better idea how to find an area to grind for better gear appropriate to their level.

And

My computer can't handle my quick traveling through the world so I can't do this in a timely fashion on my own. Hopefully if a couple of people split up the directions I can complete this project a bit faster. To get the plvl

A note on the portals: I haven't found any in this seed yet (have barely started working on it) but on the seeds I have played

**edit: UPDATE ON PORTALS** (from another seed)

For starters

There seems to be no correlation between the grid position in relation to each other. They do not connect via a straight line either through cardinal directions or diagonals cut through. It is interesting to note

**UPDATE 2**

I've debunked my theory that roads/rivers affect the spawning of dungeons. Originally I anticipated that these spaces would be reserved for Overworld bosses (trolls, etc), but I've found more than a few dungeons that cross through a road. One in a buggy sort of way (palace cuts through road), one in a nice mesh (road travels through canyon). I'm learning instead that Overworld bosses simply get reserved spawn points and they just happen to be more common around rivers/roads. An updated album will be available in a bit.

**UPDATE 3**

Okay, higher levels are generally further away, but not consistently. Portal and Overworld locations don't seem to have much rhyme or rythm to them aside from Overworld locations favoring the outskirts of a map.

**UPDATE 4**

I have no idea what happened but all my progress on the map has been lost. I have not been modifying / hacking / cheating / playing online

Oh well. I might resume the project on a new seed and just make a spiral around town to see if I can get a better understanding of how levels are assigned.

**UPDATE 5**

Haven't had much time to resume working on this. I think I'm going to just use the google docs thing in the future and upload screenshots completely unmarked. Makes more tangible sense that way. Also

So, world_server, etc files were updating quite frequently. Around 5 seconds frequently. 0_o. So, I assumed that that was the culprit and I defragmented my 7200rpm, secondary drive that I was running the game from. That did nothing.


So

1. Downloaded and installed the free version of [AMD Radeon™ RAMDisk](http://www.radeonmemory.com/software_4.0.php)

2. Created a 300MB RAMDisk.

3. Copied the whole Cube World install folder to the new virtual disk.

4. Ran the game from the RAMdisk.

5. Played for a few hours without any stutters in single player or on a server.

6. From time to time


It's not the perfect solution for everyone who's experiencing this problem

------

TL;DR: Run the game from a RAMDisk. Just be mindful and backup the save folder or the whole disk to another drive from time to time.

During the Explorer's video


---
**Fire Explosion**: You cast a powerful explosion that burns close enemies and knocks them back. Has a chance to stun enemies. 

*Lvl 2*: The cooldown lasts 6.67 seconds and the knock back is increased by 16.67%.

*Next level*: The cooldown lasts 6.15 seconds and the knock back is increased by 23.08%

---
**Mana Shield**: You are protected by a magic shield which absorbs damage for 30 seconds.

*Next level*: The cooldown lasts 19.09 seconds and you absorb 9.09% more damage

---
**Healing Stream**: You cast a stream of magic water to heal the selected ally or yourself.

*Lvl 2*: The mana costs amount to 87.5(?) MP.

*Next level*: The mana costs amount to 82.69(?) MP.

---
**Hang Gliding**: Allows the use of hang gliders

*Next level*: Your flying speed amounts to 177.27%

---
**Riding**: Enables pet riding for fast traveling

*Next level*: Your riding speed amounts to 109.09%.

---
**Pet Master**: Enables taming of pets that assist you in battle.

*Next level*: Taming is 9.09% more effective and the health of your pet is increased by 4.55%.

---
**Teleport**: You teleport to the selected location.

*Next level*: The cooldown lasts 15.09 seconds.


---

The Water Mage tree also has a passive (he mouses over the water icon when he switches trees), so I'm not sure what the passive is.

There is a skill before Hang Gliding which he doesn't mouse over, but they look to be Swimming and Sailing given their icons.

**Skill Trees**

FIRE

Fire Explosion &gt; Mana Shield &gt; Teleport

Pet Master &gt; Riding

Rock Climbing &gt; Hang Gliding

Swimming &gt; Sailing



WATER

Healing Stream &gt; Mana Shield &gt; Teleport

Pet Master &gt; Riding

Rock Climbing &gt; Hang Gliding

Swimming &gt; Sailing

-----------------------
**Notes**

It appears that the only thing changing from the two trees is Fire Explosion and Healing Stream. Also, but that can be changed in the future. 

I'm not sure what it means by taming being more ""effective"" upon leveling it.

You can click on each one to go into its detail screen and find additional information like whether the pet is mountable, you can find filtering options. You can filter the list to e.g. only show wanted/not acquired pets, or only mountable ones.


There are also sorting options to sort alphabetically by pet name or by food.


More features are on the way


So as I said


An iOS version is being made


If you have any suggestions/bugs


-Edit-

Version 1.6 has been published to the store. It'll be up shortly! Changes:

--- Version 1.6 ---

- Added checkbox for when you have food for a pet in the pet's detail screen
- Added filter options for showing pets you have/don't have the food for
- Added category dividers to the filtering options

--- Version 1.5c ---

- Added non-tamable pet Koala
- Data is now more efficient
- Biomes are now sorted alphabetically

The new moderators are:

/u/Syberz

I felt like taking 4 new Moderators in total

Anyway, but not telling me why they want to moderate. Another problem has been that I had people showing off how many moderation experience they have as if it was some kind of Job they apply to. Often the sentence ""I would love to help the Community/become a mod"" fell, but everything listed in the application could have been done without being a mod. Being friendly is also not a requirement to become a mod.

Generally it showed me really well, so I can see if they fit.

To disallow any edit after ninja-edit also allowed me to discard 2 applications right away. It was generally a training for the mod section

**1. A Problem With Surplus Money**

I dunno about you guys, so the prices should be increased, and there should also be more buyable items.

**2. The Ocean is Fucking Boring**

In my first world, and Snowies have ice flowers which you have to melt. But the oceans have little heart flowers, but they are very scarce, and can only be found on islands. Sure, this adds difficulty, but I think it'd be better if you could harvest seaweed or coral and use that to make a potion. Furthermore, it'd also be great if you could use seaweed to strengthen or craft armor. For instance, you could craft (or enhance it to) *Immaculate Iron Armor of the Sea*. Anyway

**3. Automatic Boat/Glider Switching**

Most experience Cube World players (or Cubenauts as I call them, and then having to stop, press **I**, and switch from boat to glider so you can escape his pursuit. This is frustrating, as you probably know first-hand. So, I propose that the switching between them be automatic. If you're in air or on land, the glider will be equipped when you press **G**, and keeps you from dying. I think this would be a great and useful addition.

**4. Something Fucking Special**

*... With all due respect....* Seriously, just to find out that every single thing has the exact same description of *There's nothing special.* I understand that this is probably a planned feature, but I just wish that Wollay/Pixxie hadn't implemented the ability to examine things if there's never something special about the objects you can examine. I personally think they should have waited.

**5. Bats in Underwater Caves?**

Yes, even under water. I may be wrong about that, though. I'd personally rather there be no mobs in marine caves than bats. But as for the suggestion, there should be something scary like an octopus or something in marine caves. Maybe floating spike ball things (I forget what they're called, but they are marine creatures with spines and spikes like porcupines) in caves that you have to evade?

**6. Brighter lanterns for Marine Caves**

As I said before, as well. Also, I feel like in ocean cities there should be a place to customize the sail of your ship; this way, people can't create crazy models for ships, but instead just edit the sail. I mean, you payed 10 freaking silver for the ship, so make it your own

**7. Better World Map**

When you zoom out on the world map as far as you can, the map should show the names of the lands because that's what we'd care about knowing from that distance away form the map. The text of the names of dungeons and whatnot change according to difficulty, but why don't the colors of the lands' names? How are you supposed to know where in your world is best suited for your level? Also, the colors of the lands themselves should change according to biome. All of this improves the maps clarity, and I don't see why it wouldn't be implemented in the future.

**8. Lagging Hotkeys**

Sometimes, but it's not just me. I've heard about it happening to other people (including my brother).

**9. Pet Call Key**

**Edit: The T key already does this

Has anyone here ever played Red Dead Redemption? In that game when you press one of the D-Pad directions (I forget which one), I don't expect something so mainstream. So far, pets are slow when compared to us on our gliders, and fairly glitchy, too. Some times, in the middle of combat, your pet isn't with you, and un-equip the pet

**10. Those Repulsive Rocks**

Okay, and while my eyes scan it, [I come across something that truly bugs me.](http://imgur.com/RHcdgIX) Seriously, though; imagine the mountains and hills without those protruding, unrealistically shaped boulders. It'd look a lot better. I like the rocks, but I just wish they were more naturally broken and random looking. 



Anyway, but I also love the idea of constructive criticism. So what does /r/CubeWorld think the game needs? What do you want it to have? What did you think of my ideas? I kept my ideas pretty close to the Cube World basics, but feel free to think and comment abstractly, and think outside the box! :D

I've been experiencing cubeworld quite excessively and what I've been finding out is that crafting materials for the most part is only good if you drag someone lower level than you into having better equipment. I'd love to use it for my own good

I would rather use my found diamonds/rubies/sapphires/emeralds/gold/etc. for enhancing my current armor/weapons with special spheres/elements that you can put on your weapon

For instance, which makes the weapon stronger. Things like that would really make me as an end-game character want to farm loads of minerals to enhance my gear.

1373681433.0,1i71ss,Using Cube World to Cope,ISleepTheDayAway,63,42,19,"So first I'd like to start off and say this is from the perspective of a long time FPS/Twitch Shooter gamer. I'd say I started off Gaming on PC with TF2 and then my PC became outdated and I moved onto Xbox and played games such as Halo and Call of Duty. I remember torrenting Minecraft and playing it for two weeks and had a lot of fun and bought it the on Halloween night (The night the Nether was implemented) very much enjoyed the game but I never really stuck with it
           

Anyways, but were fixing up the house as we've been overpaying on it for years) So after taking a standard basement used for storage we laid drywall, carpet, painted the walls, etc. And basically re-painting and re-doing carpet and several other rooms we just finished the Kitchen and were mostly finished with the house.


 We sent the pictures over to our landlord, but it's all my parents would allow when we got the first one and the second was a rescue. And I love them.) It was definitely a downgrade but I didn't mind as it was short notice, everything was basically set in place until they ran my parents license plate after meeting them for the second time and we haven't heard back since. We were hoping to move in the 14 days, but that's not looking like it's going to happen.


So in summary of all of that, and how I've loved it. I'm an Undead Warrior and don't quite understand how mechanics such as blocking work and the secondary mouse attack. But my companion Collie (Named Ally after my Ex) who's always been at my side and I are learning. I never quite understood the addiction or that feeling to play more of games like Minecraft or World of Warcraft and as a guy who plays FPS's and Twitch Shooters competitively I didn't expect to like a game like this. Sadly the servers were down so I had to torrent it, but planned on buying when I had the money. But I fear I'll lose my character and my dear Collie if I do. I still play CS:GO usually daily, but whenever I get stressed out or need to just get away from the world I either boot up and play with my buddy Austin on his server or by myself. And I don't think I've felt this piece of mind in a long time.

I haven't been monitoring Wollay or Pixxie

First, Climbing, and Swimming skills are just thrown together in one page. 
For this, and ""Dexterity"", or more likely closer to ""Courage"", ""Wisdom"", and ""Guile"" to avoid the usual fantasy tropes. Things that increase physical damage/the effectiveness of Strength related attacks or reduce the amount of Stamina used on your dodging, climbing, etc would go under Strength/Courage because endurance is generally related to Strength. Things that reduce the mana cost of abilities or say...increase the duration of crowd control effects go under Wisdom. As for Guile
Of course

Which is where the larger ideas come into play. Total overhaul of how characters work. Stay with 4 classes and unrestrict weapons. To make sure that a Mage doesn't kick your ass with knuckles, along with a few of the ones in play already like Tempo and Armor.

The important part is that a Mage with certain skills or stat changes could cast a (not super strong) Fireball

They could even make different modes of the game. One would be a simple version, so it isn't the best answer, but it's an idea.

House building should be a relevant, and decorate it with unique things that you can use for your adventures. If they are going to go with premade rooms that snap on, a decent number of types of materials/shapes/styles should be available. 
You could go with the idea of making a few pieces of furniture the focus of where your house is. The bed would be the prime respawn point within a certain radius of your home at a reduced or no cost


Quests are on their way, but lose reputation IF someone got away and there was a decent distance from any peaceful travelers.
No rep grinds. We did too much of that

This is all I have for now

 Thanks for reading and thanks to [Wollay](https://twitter.com/wol_lay) and [Pixxie](https://twitter.com/pix_xie) for making something with so much potential!

**Here are some things I have come up with:**

* Better gliders and boats for a premium price.

* Shop sells an expensive teleport tablet

* Conversion rate for platinum coins. (buy platinum coins for a large sum of money).

* (not really an idea
a large money sink.
