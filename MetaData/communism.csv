1371771136.0,1gremb,Brazil's protests have become fascist,starmeleon,278,88,163,"Hello comrades.  

I am here to give you information about what is currently going on in Brazil. I am brazilian

The first thing I will tell you is that you should not pay attention to what the rest of reddit is telling you about the protests

The protests which are currently going on are severely dynamic

The context of the protest is as follows:  

The initial wave of protests were organized by the MPL, based primarily in public universities. [Their main goal is and always was free, public funded transportation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_public_transport). The protests were organized in response to (left-wing, social democrat/liberal PT Worker's Party) mayor Fernando Haddad's and (right-wing, conservative, social democrat in name only PSDB governor) Geraldo Alckimin's hikes in bus and metro fares.  

The protests were instantly joined by communist parties PSTU, denounced party participation. This will become important later on.  

The media, accusing it of vandalism, and of being made-up by extreme leftists. [This is a prime example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=luLzhtSYWC4). They justified the actions of the armed Military Police of Brazil (which is a Gendarme), which was, at the time, shooting rubber bullets at people's faces (which is lethal), beating up primarily women, as well as several intimidation tactics

The media realized that despite all of their efforts, and noticing that their most reactionary viewers were ready to take the street, switched strategies.  

[As I predicted in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1ggzfy/stand_up_with_the_proletarians_of_brazil_spread/cakfwgv), and started to tell his viewers that the protests were about the long running list of anti-leftist complaints that were traditionally presented by the media against the left leaning worker's party and used electorally by the right-wing PSDB. The rest of the media did exactly the same thing. They even set up the narrative on the [international level, using this video that became the means through which reddit became aware of the protests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=AIBYEXLGdSg). This would later serve to legitimize the fascist coup in the eyes of the international audience.  

Now here is the tricky part. As I said in a [previous post about that particular video](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1ggzfy/stand_up_with_the_proletarians_of_brazil_spread/cak6y5g) you will notice that there is nothing intrinsically socialist about the video. Socialists, wasteful spending and the degradation of public services. HOWEVER, this has to be looked at in the context that the media has built over the years that the semi-leftist PT government has been in the presidency of the country.  

Maybe one example most socialists here will be more familiar with is the [Venezuelan media and it's participation in the attempted 2002 coup against Hugo Chavez

In fact, which is owned by the billionaire heirs of Roberto Marinho, who had a personal fortune of 60 billion dollars, had previously attempted in 2007 to spark an [artificial ""popular"" march against the PT government led by several celebrities on its payroll](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimento_C%C3%ADvico_pelo_Direito_dos_Brasileiros).  

[**I SHOULD ALSO STRONGLY REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE 1964 MILITARY COUP WAS PRECEDED BY A MILLION STRONG REACTIONARY MARCH ON THE STATE OF GUANABARA ASKING FOR FASCISM AGAINST THE REFORMIST SOC-DEM JOÃO GOULART**](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcha_da_Fam%C3%ADlia_com_Deus_pela_Liberdade). So to those who are simply enamoured by any public protest thinking its impossible that the right can muster popular support

Now, watching how giddy the media is with the whole thing. You are probably not aware that the agenda against ""corruption"" was [suggested by the military chief of police when negotiating with MPL](http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/brasil/sp/2013-06-17/comandante-geral-da-pm-sugere-politizacao-de-protestos-em-sao-paulo.html) You are also probably not aware that the large majority of the opposition to the Worker's Party does not come from the radical left, as I wish it did, as MPL does, but it comes from PSDB and half of their electors are nostalgic of our fascist dictatorship. So they are going out there and [asking for a new one](http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/q71/s720x720/972005_274587252681267_195263270_n.jpg).  

The sign says ""military intervention now. For the *democratic* government of civilians and military"" which is

As I write this

Many leftists are only now waking up to this fact

Context: The toucan is the mascot for the right wing party. The other comic shows how the protest's agenda was hijacked by right wing demands.  

Now, much like the 1964 military dictatorship proceeded to do. MPL and the anarchists are failing to react to this and are fueling the right wing rhetoric.  

There are also sections of the left which are too isolated in their group of friends and comrades to realize that the majority of people participating in the marches are not their friends. The majority of people joined in after the calls of reactionary media pundits. In many cities which the protests were not started by the left the protests are solely about the right wing protesting against left-politics. Do not be naive

Meanwhile, its this one) is [supporting the protests](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTydPLKxUbw). The brazilian Pedro Carmona sharpens his fangs.  

So I find it extremely upsetting that clueless redditors

So when the judiciary, does some kind of maneuver to oust the left-leaning Dilma Roussef in favor of elections or whatever that bring back the neo-liberal PSDB to power, the international community will be ready to validate the coup. I should remind you all that this is the [textbook tactic of 21st century fascism, as taught to us by Honduras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_constitutional_crisis).  

Brazil is in danger of going fascist

Reddit disgusts me.

The workers were stirring - the time was at hand!  
The councils were meeting
The masses were ready -uprise now or never.  
The people were angry and prepared to fight
Cries of ""Revolution!"" rang into the night.  


And all of my comrades from Council 19
Both Party and movement and all inbetween
Took to the streets and rose up in a clatter
Bourgeois illusions were thoroughly shatterred.  
We marched down Bay Street with our fists in the air
Then a cadre behind me set off a flare.  


We knew by the light that it was time to go
So we donned our face masks
We shouldered our weapons- some rifles
Disorganised comrades began throwing bricks.  
""The state's not a window""; this lesson we knew
Pigs fell back ahead


I thought back to our meeting some hours before
Where a communist comrade had taken the floor.  
""To Marx! To Hoxha! To Mao and to Lenin!  
To Engels! To Luxemburg! To Che and to Stalin!""  
we cheered all their names and pledged to create
A communist world by smashing the state.  


But now in the moment the pig lines had reformed
Bolstered by army; we'd been misinformed!  
I thought that the soldiers had all deserted
As into their ranks
But before me I saw
Some soldiers had stayed and had entered the fray.  


I drew my last breath
Political power; it grows from a gun.  
Without an army the people have nothing;  
Could it have been that the Party was bluffing?  
But to my delight
It was only the pigs who started to shout.  


As the confusion and piggies began to die down
From the army ahead we could hear a sound.  
Songs as red as the blood that the workers had shed
Were carried up-street and entered our heads.  
The song they were singing we knew right away
The Internationale had carried the day.  


And Council 19
The soldiers
The battle was won
Against the state and the bosses we clearly were winning.  
Main Street had been cleared
In the distance I saw a rising red sun.  


But if this night sounds too good to be true
I'll pause and I'll say: It could happen to you!  
Nothing written above should seem like fiction
If anything it should be viewed as prediction  
The masses of workers are angry and waiting
The people just need some more agitating.  
And so I propose: get off your tush

A few months ago, I could hardly keep track of them all. So I decided I would ""publish"" a one page communist newsletter that would hopefully shed light on the truth about communism. 

The first newsletter was about capitalism. It just layed out all of the problems with capitalism and all of the harm it causes to the workers and the environment (for the ""green"" kids that were reading.) Apparently

My second newsletter was about the fundamentals of communism and debunking its misconceptions. Since those two papers have been released

http://www.psmag.com/magazines/pacific-standard-cover-story/joe-henrich-weird-ultimatum-game-shaking-up-psychology-economics-53135/

It tells the story of a group of three academic colleagues, some background.

For anyone who has argued with vulgar liberals on political issues, by nature, *all* human beings are selfish and so seek the maximum benefit from whatever thing they are doing.  This idealized notion of the 'thing they are doing' usually means economic activity, and so for westerners this means the capitalist system is the greatest because it allows people to compete with each other under equal auspices of the law thus allowing for maximum personal development and individualism and so on until *Atlas Shrugged* itself has been vomited from the mouth of the liberal you've decided to converse with.

Marxism has taught that human behavior is not something innate to human beings (i.e. ""human nature"") but rather something wrought from human social interactions and interactions with the environment itself

&gt;The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought

The argument for a ""human nature"" polemic against socialism is the exact thing that Engels said we shouldn't be doing, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice...""  At best, such an argument comes from a vulgar, pseudo-materialist perspective that looks solely to the basis of social interaction in which the person making the argument comes from, that being the west, which has a social structure that is very well built on selfishness and exploitation.  It is of no surprise then that in the academic west social scientists have sought to prove through their research efforts that everyone the world over acts as westerners do, because, you know

It is in this context that makes the above linked article so interesting.  Why?  Because the evidence the studies have gathered point to exactly what Marx and Engels had been saying as being correct.  Let us take interest in some quotes:

&gt;He [the anthropologist] knew that a vast amount of scholarly literature in the social sciences—particularly in economics and psychology—relied on the ultimatum game and similar experiments. At the heart of most of that research was the implicit assumption that the results revealed evolved psychological traits common to all humans
...  
Economists and psychologists, it was agreed, so human hardwiring for much behavior, perception, and cognition should be similarly universal. No need, in that case, to look beyond the convenient population of undergraduates for test subjects. A 2008 survey of the top six psychology journals dramatically shows how common that assumption was: more than 96 percent of the subjects tested in psychological studies from 2003 to 2007 were Westerners—with nearly 70 percent from the United States alone. Put another way: 96 percent of human subjects in these studies came from countries that represent only 12 percent of the world’s population.  
...  
As Heine, they began to find research suggesting wide cultural differences almost everywhere they looked: in spatial reasoning, the way we infer the motivations of others, categorization, moral reasoning, the boundaries between the self and others, and other arenas. These differences, were not genetic. The distinct ways Americans and Machiguengans played the ultimatum game, without fully realizing it, or a bad Yelp review) when they feel cheated. Because Machiguengan culture had a different history

(emphasis mine)

If Marx were alive he would have just shat his pants and in a bearded rage shouted

Furthermore, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic* or, WEIRD).  

Neither the paper nor the article says anything about the means and methods by which people have become WEIRD

The bottom line is that culture is shaped by the world we live in (a social construct) based fundamentally on the given mode of economic production.  The next time some liberal tries to talk to you about ""human nature"" tell them to stop being a fucking WEIRDo and to see human society as it exists in its complex wholeness. ☭☭☭",,t5_2qolz,1366845978.0,,redstar,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1d1l5y/against_human_nature_or_shit_just_got_weird/

Their subterfuge is pretending that left-wing protesters are naive, and interviewing one of their living descendants and claimants to the throne (yes this exists and yes, it is absurd), who wrote books advocating the restoration of monarchy and supporting the traditional agricultural land owning class, and other stuff such as calling environmentalists mentally ill and writing global warming denialist books.

**To the the male audience

(1) Not everyone is a ""bro"", ""guy"", ""dude"", etc. Please don't assume gender unless you are certain. Instead, use [gender-neutral pronouns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun). When addressing a general crowd, we are **comrades** and not ""guys"".

(2) ""Mens rights"" are counter-revolutionary. Men are not oppressed in any regards due to their gender. You cannot be a ""mens rights activist"" and a communist simultaneously.

(3) Pornography is exploitation and oppression against women

(4) Prostitution is not liberating but cruel exploitation of women and a social ill which needs to be terminated.

No communist movement can be successful without the participation of women. In the on-going people's wars

In Bangladesh during the liberation war

In Nepal, adulterers, and so forth.

In Peru, slit the throats of men who cried or were cowards. See ""[Shining Path Women: So Many and So Ferocious""](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/world/lima-journal-shining-path-women-so-many-and-so-ferocious.html) from NY Times.

By way of introduction, where students from a multitude of different locales (Quebec City, Rimouski, Toronto, Guelph, and New York just to name a few) and revolutionary organisations will come together. What we're trying to do is build a student and youth movement that is actually combative and capable of fighting back against the Canadian ruling class' reactionary offensive, in a way that the current social-democratic student organisations haven't been able to.

So here's where r/communism comes in:

We're hoping to have participants from an even wider variety of cities, and you think the development of a revolutionary student movement is important, **please get in contact with me**. Or, if you aren't a student but know revolutionary students and youth who you think would be interested in this, **please have them get in contact with me**. I'll hopefully be travelling throughout Ontario in mid-April to try and promote the conference, so the more people I can speak to along the way the better.

Here's more information for people that want it:

My favourite class was AP macroeconomics and after the class economics became a bit of a hobby of mine, a bit of an anarchist. Soon I became interested in Marx' *Capital* wanting to understand the deeper analysis of capitalism.

As many of you must have seen

I also would like to recommend this text by a radical trans feminist which express some good points and I generally agree with everything she said (as I myself subscribe to a non-exclusionary radical feminism): http://radtransfem.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/sex-educations-gendering-and-regendering-women/    

There were a recent debate in a local blog between such sects, this also contradicts the main stance of radical feminism which I'll explain below. On the other side, some trans people where saying that they aren't oppressed by patriarchy but by cis women specifically, also they claim cis women aren't ""that oppressed"" which is also unfortunate and untrue.    

To make it easier for us to handle such debate when it appears

**These are okay:**    


Radical feminism   
* gender is a social construct
* there are specific issues of being socialized as a girl/woman that need to be addressed.  
* Patriarchy oppresses female bodied individuals and promotes hate against female bodies.  
* in the current society
* denouncing LGBT movements that exclude lesbians and bisexual women.   
* rejecting so called ""sex positive"" trends in feminist movements and adopting anti-pornography line.    


Trans activists    
* trans women are actual women and they belong in the women liberation movements.    
* acknowledgment and visibility of trans(*) identities.    
* one can have physical incongruence with their genitals and other characteristics used by patriarchy to assign sex to individuals
* there are specific issues of not identifying with your gender assigned at birth and these need to be addressed.
* denouncing LGBT movements that exclude transgenders.

I think all those points are correct and they aren't mutually exclusive in any way.    

**These aren't okay:**   
 

Radical feminism    
* identity politics. (in this case
* ""transwomen are men trying to hijack feminism"".      
* gender essentialism: one need to to have XX sexual chromosomes and to be female bodied in order to be considered a woman. (those who support this are not only completely wrong
* ""apolitical"" alignment
            

Trans activists    
* identity politics.      
* ""born this way""
* oppression olympics (saying that ciswomen are SO MUCH more privileged is really absurd, but it's not a competition of who has it worse, women or people of colour.)     
* misogyny disguised as identity statements. (example: I remember a person in SRSgaming saying their queer friends would make ""vaginophobic"" jokes in their world of warcraft party


Both sides lack of a proper structural approach.    
Here are some quotes from the article that I thought useful and pretty much express my opinion on this subject:   

&gt; Radical feminism understands gender as an ideology of male supremacy

I wholeheartedly agree with this. It's necessary to abolish gender, but how the patriarchal ideology is real and present on our lives. Patriarchy is a systematically oppressive reality that puts women in a submissive role.     

&gt; Cisgendered violence isn’t necessarily ‘more’ or ‘less’ violent than gendered violence – I would like to reject these terms as absolute properties of violence, in which transsexual and cissexual women can compete to decide who had the most unhappy childhoods. Cissexism and sexism are not comparable, are both tragedies, and cannot be traded off against one another.     
 
This is very important. It's not wise to reject the experience of cis-women as women and victims of the patriarchy

&gt; Who owns the term ‘woman’? I’m not interested in defining it biologically. As a feminist

This also applies to race. The ""black race"" is a political category
Despite that

&gt; In writing this essay, in that many of our oppressions are identical or similar and we are both exposed to, and absorb, sex role education about what we – women – should be and do.      
&gt; Gender ideology is sufficiently potent that it is able to bring both cissexual women and transsexual women to some extent under the influence of the female sex role. This is done using a variety of tactics, i.e. to place us in a position of submission to patriarchy so that male power can be upheld.     

In short

As I said

First of all, sexuality, race, etc, one has those cast upon them from early age, still children can interact in different manners with the social stimuli from this early age and are able to perceive and describe themselves according these stimuli.     

As a communist, it's moral values and its mechanisms of reproduction.

&gt;Communists do not fight for personal military power (they must in no circumstances do that, for military power for the people. As a national war of resistance is going on, we must also fight for military power for the nation. Where there is naivety on the question of military power, nothing whatsoever can be achieved. It is very difficult for the labouring people, who have been deceived and intimidated by the reactionary ruling classes for thousands of years, to awaken to the importance of having guns in their own hands. Now that Japanese imperialist oppression and the nation-wide resistance to it have pushed our labouring people into the arena of war, Communists should prove themselves the most politically conscious leaders in this war. Every Communist must grasp the truth, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party. Yet, create schools, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good

1352082931.0,12n975,A critique of liberal feminism.,atlol2,57,19,13,"There are several important demands for a society where equality is sought after in the objective relations of people

There is something that bothers me about the majority of blogs that I read about the subject (which I must confess, which is the excessive liberal discourse. Such blogs make several important complaints and demands, but they hardly ever offer solutions, or will leave the solutions to the field of philosophical speculation or fighting in the bourgeois judicial system, under its own terms. This kind of feminism also tries to pretend to be apolitical, as if the conflict between left wing and right wing could never solve the question of women's oppression. Yes, there are several men in the left which are sexist, or the right wing that calls itself the left, ignores that historically the left has always been for women's rights (even in victorian times, and were political militants against oppression and inequality

Of course, including in capitalist countries. I advance the view that many rights were granted in western countries not just because of civil rights movements, such as those that took place in America in the 1960's, but also because the great disparity between capitalism and socialism would become very evident otherwise. In the case of civil rights, we can just look at propaganda from socialist countries, which praised the joint efforts of all races in building a socialist nation, we look at their anti-racist laws, after the disappearance of actually existing socialist nations, which use faulty methodology and statistical research

Going back to my original criticism of post-modern liberal feminism

1) The demand for more ""women CEOs""

I see many blogs complaining that the majority of CEOs are men and that women should have more high hierarchy jobs.One of the authors that mentions this is Naomi Wolf in her book ""The Beauty Myth"". Demanding for more women CEOs ignores the negative aspect of the existance of CEOs. I do not want to be a CEO, I want the capitalist class to be destroyed. Why would any women act differently from men if she became a capitalist? We do not believe in gender essentialism, that there are innate biological characteristics that grants any gender a propensity for goodness or extra dilligence. Historical materialism teaches us that society produces the consciousness of the individual. Margaret Thatcher is not going to be good for anyone. What difference should we make from Thatcher or Reagan? In the latest hollywood produced propaganda, the Iron Lady, the historical context of Thatcher and Britain is abstracted so that only her own personal history becomes relevant, and thus they can attempt to turn her into a feminist icon who faced and dealt with the sexism of the men around her (I don't deny that this happened). This is the distortion of liberalism and liberal feminism, that fails to mention that Thatcher was the oppressor of millions of british women who lost access to several guarantees to essential items for their livelihood, not counting the labor of other third world women which for centuries and to this day is used to prop up british capitalism. We should not wish for women to reach equal status as oppressors within the capitalist system.    

2) Extreme anti-violence posture.  

Some feminists (a very vocal example is Anita Sarkesheen of the Feminist Frequency blog, while stoic and violent solutions are seen as masculine, and due to the fact that society is patriarchal, these masculine attitudes are more often than not seen as the positive ones. The conclusion of some people, mainly those who aim to be critics of popular culture, is that if a woman is stoic or uses violence to solve a conflict, she is adhering to masculine values, liberals (both in general

We should question the assumption that women who solve conflicts violently are adhering to masculine traits or values. Does that mean that all the women who were soviet war heroes, because they are inadequate examples due to their violence and thus undeserving of our admiration?     

It is evident to me that this kind of liberalism that claims to be apolitical fails to account for real life examples in which women have fought and won battles towards their liberation. In fact

Why is that? Obviously, he uses a mix of rabid nationalism, religion and old Soviet ideology, which sometimes takes rather disgusting forms, as with pop stalinism.

What exactly is pop stalinism? This is a 'rehabilitaion' of Stalin, but as an 'effective manager' (literally!), 'great state leader' and a 'moderniser' (who modernised the economy). Comparison with Putin is obvious: 'Putin is Stalin today!'

Generally we have this explained by weekly reposts of that John Steinbeck quote in /r/socialism. I would like to discuss this.  

First of all

We know that liberalism is the dominant ideology in most of the world today

There is of course, for better or worse, the US representing the international bourgeoisie and the USSR representing the international proletariat. Undoubtedly curtailing the expansion of the USSR was in the interests of the international bourgeoisie in a way that curtailing fascism never was (the international bourgeoisie was great with Pinochet, Franco, Salazar, Saddam, the Apartheid, according to their convenience), the attempt to guide class struggle towards or away from revolution everywhere.   

So in the context of the cold-war, in every news channel, in cultural production, in grassroots political organizing, and so on, in a manner that wasn't so thorough in other countries. That is one possibility. We would have to ask ourselves why this was particularly stronger in the US. Was it due to its status as the leader in the fight against the eastern bloc, and as such

There is also the theory of labor-aristocracy. The US, other imperialist nations are very nearly the same in this regard, arguably with small differences (slightly higher or lower wages, the presence welfare states, different consumption habits).  

Perhaps the way that US society is organized, in general, generate more individualism than densely populated areas. Perhaps it is the US's ""unique"" historical background that prevents it from considering leftist ideas in the same way, with the liberal founding fathers and their cult of personality being more emphasized? Perhaps it is nationalism?  

I suppose I am just looking at all these variables and trying to look at the hypothesis that the US is special in it's anti-leftism. There are several of these that seem to have some validity to them

Indifference is the burden of history. Indifference operates with great power on history. It operates passively, happens because most of humanity renounces its own will, allows laws to be passed that only revolt can nullify, and leaves men that only mutiny can overthrow to achieve power. Thanks to indifference, few hands weave the fabric of collective life unsurveilled, and the masses ignore it because they are careless; then it seems like it is fate that runs over everything and everyone, it looks as if history is but an enormous natural phenomenon, an earthquake of which everyone is a victim, others curse obscenely, if I had tried to impose my will

This too is why I hate the indifferent: Their wailing as if eternally innocent is a nuisance to me. I hold every person liable to how they fulfilled the task life has given them and continues to give them every day, not to squander my compassion, of not having to share my tears with them.

I am a partisan, the social chain does not rest on a few, nothing that happens in it is a matter of luck, nor the product of fate, but the intelligent work of citizens. In it, nobody is looking out their window while the few sacrifice and drain themselves. I live, I am a partisan. That is why I hate those who don’t take sides

I personally view any sort of animal rights struggle as coming far behind human class struggle in importance. It only really seems to exist in the most privileged sectors of the first world and in my mind detracts from a focus on combating capitalism. That said

I think at this point the decision to eat meat or not is a personal choice often dictated by class

Obama is right-wing. He has extended the Bush tax cuts under his administration. He has filled his cabinet with conservative advisers, and vowed to cut $4 Trillion more in his next term. Him and Romney both agree on this. It may also interest some comrades to know that 600,000 public sector jobs have vanished under Obama. Even under Bush, 800,000 public sector jobs were created.

As for ""allies of the working class, a city and state notorious for its anti-labor actions in an attempt to make it a more lucrative spot for business. Obama is also a close friend of Ralph Emanuel, the mayor who opposed the Chicago teachers' strike. Even Romney sided with Emanuel on the issue of the teachers' strike. Some big difference between the parties, alright. Not only that, but Obama's ""Race to the Top"" legislation is more of the same ""educational reform"" bullshit that demands merit pay and teacher evaluation based on testing.

Now to civil rights,000 per missile, if I'm not mistaken.

As for Obama's supposed success at revitalizing the failing capitalist economy, because corporate profits have reached record-breaking highs under the watchful eyes of the Democrats while wages and jobs continue to plummet.

None of this information is secret. Comrades who have been following the US election closely will know most of this. I only hope that I've given those undecided comrades something to consider.

It almost makes me wonder if it was truly him who's written it. The biography I'm reading is in French, so let me attempt to translate the letter in English:

1370377866.0,1fob2i,The Social Function of Job Interviews (a Marxist-Feminist critique in plain language),boleroinferno,39,10,4,"I tried today to give a female friend advice about interviewing for a job. My advice went along the lines of 'act confident', and moreover in retrospect it seems that all the advice I'd ever heard was directed at an audience which was assumed to be male.
Naturally I wondered: what are the expectations of women in job interviews? Moreover

""According to a study by Frank Bernieri, within the first 10 seconds of meeting your interviewer--otherwise known as the meet-and-greet--that person has decided whether or not you're right for the job.""

So if a job interview lasts 10 minutes when the hiring decision was made in 10 seconds, is it necessarily an accurate decision and to what standard? The author of the article seems to think it's meaningful as she further asserts that,

""Those who come across as polished and pulled together are quite simply more likely to be hired than those who are seen as putting in less effort.""

Let's think about this for a moment. How many of us have 'failed' a job interview in favor of someone comparably well-dressed and prepared? What does “pulled together” even refer to? The key phrase 'who are seen as' of course descends the whole prescription into subjectivity. This is quite important to note since a person with money certainly can make arbitrary judgments about who to hire (anti-discrimination laws are never sufficient to eliminate discrimination). In order

The second half of the article is an extended discussion of what to wear to an interview with such suggestions that women 'dress conservatively' with 'absolutely no cleavage' while decrying 'casual ensembles' as sloppy-looking. The crisis of women who don't know what to wear is apparently so great that it has spawned a separate industry whose job it is to (arduously) look past the shallowest surface of a prospective employee:

""Zoller, and they had great résumés, but they weren't getting jobs because they didn't know how to dress.""""

My god, industrious, or competent? This is not only a pathetic admission because it shows how important dressing to company norms and dressing 'to one's gender' is. It is also a statement about business-as-usual in an economy with a perpetual army of unemployed workers. The employer-employee power relationship allows the employer to often make arbitrary decisions about hiring or firing based on personal bias or irrelevant factors such as political views or minor differences in fashion sense.

""Multiple accessories and bright colors should be reserved for an evening out with friends. The idea is to give the interviewer the impression that you are already part of their company.""

Besides giving the not-entirely-untruthful image of corporations as gray warehouses packed with thousands of uniformly-dressed employees chasing tiny slices of cheese on hamster wheels
It is obvious that a company looking to hire on this basis is not looking for hirees with any sort of creative perspectives or non-standard processes. Companies sometimes advertise for 'self-directed' workers

This will surely be my last opportunity to address you. The Air Force has bombed the antennas of Radio Magallanes. My words have neither bitterness but disappointment. They should stand as a moral castigation of those who have been traitors to their oaths: Chilean soldiers, who has designated himself commander of the Navy, even more señor Mendoza, the cringing general who only yesterday manifested his fidelity and loyalty to the Government, and who also has named himself Director General of the Carabineros. In the face of these deeds it only falls to me to say to the workers: I shall not resign!

Standing at a historic point, they can make us their vassals, but not stop the social processes, neither by crime nor by force. History is ours and is made by the people.

Workers of my Nation: I want to thank you for the loyalty you have always had, and who did so. In this final moment, the last in which I will be able to address myself to you, I want you to take advantage of the lesson: foreign capital, imperialism, united with reaction, created the climate for the Armed Forces to break their tradition, victims of the same social sector that today will be be expecting with an alien hand to reconquer the power to continue defending their profits and their privileges.

I address myself to you, the mother who knew of our concern for the children. I address myself to the professionals of the Nation, to the patriotic professionals who continued working against the sedition overseen by their professional academies, classist academies that also defended the advantages of a capitalist society.

I address myself to the youth, to the campesino, to the intellectual, to those who will be percecuted, because in our country fascism has now been present for several hours; in the terrorist assassinations, blowing up the bridges, cutting the railways, in the face of the silence of those who had the obligation to behave.

They are in jeopardy. History will judge them.

Radio Magallanes will surely be silenced and the tranquil metal of my voice will no longer reach you. It is not important. You will continue to hear it. I will always be together with you. At least my memory will be that of an upright man who was loyal to the Nation.

The people ought to defend themselves

Workers of my Nation, we will reopen the great promenades down which free men pass, to construct a better society.

 Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!

These are my last words and I have certainty that my sacrifice will not be in vain, I will be a moral lesson to castigate felony, cowardice, and treason.

I know that posting US specific news in this subreddit is frowned upon

This is no surprise. But what is interesting to me is that traditionally liberal subreddits like /r/politics, etc are absolutely enraged by these new findings. The sentiment has turned overwhelming against not just the government in general but the Democrats who have pushed forward this domestic spying. Top comments have literally been calling for revolt against this unjust system that is fucking everyone over. These subreddits, populated mainly by middle class white Americans, are calling for the end to the current US government. In my opinion, that's a pretty big deal.

I wound up writing like 12 pages double spaced in Word about the subject, comments

----------------------------------------------------------------

First realize that Stalin and Mao very very different people, and different cultures. Its a vast over simplification to say ""communism"" where in reality both are dealing with their adopted form of communism for their particular state. Maoism and Stalinist (a morph of Marxist-Leninist).


Additionally before we begin I would like to make a personal note. The capitalist west has long tried to hold onto the moral high ground. Where this sense of superiority comes from I have no idea. The capitalist west is largely built on slave labor, and your way of life is fed by the blood and suffering of millions of people worldwide. The true difference I see in most peoples interpretation of the moral question, is that in the SU you died without a choice, while in the USA you choose to die, or that the dying takes place somewhere else by someone else. In the case of the SU the perception in the west was that power was completely invested in one person, so all the guilt must fall to that one person, where as in the USA and other western countries we elected our leaders and thus our guilt is distributed. The argument for Stalin and Mao is as much a practical one about proving some degree of innocence (or at least not total guilt) as it is an ideological one on educating the audience enough for them to get past the preconceived notion of absolute power in one person


Lastly, and the historical (and that includes pre-communist rule) context of actions gives me enough proof to be mitigating factors in my judgement of Stalin and Mao. Maybe what I show you after wont be enough for you, but do consider your own judgments and where they come from and why. I dont believe that looking away from things changes them, but I think that the closer you look the more things start to differ from the ""approved"" version.

I guess my point is that ideas cannot die

In fact it is not communism that suffers from inevitable failure but Capitalism. Capitalism by its nature is ultimately unsustainable. The West only continues to trudge along the way it is because of the large scale exploitation of developing nations.

1340678487.0,vlwwc,The beginning of a new idea concerning an analysis of North Korea.,bradleyvlr,42,9,15,"As a Marxist, I

It is important when concerning a matter dialectically to begin with where a society is coming from. Korea is historically a nation (or two or three) that has ranged from regional empire to victim of imperialism to several centuries of isolation. One would think foreign rulers might be talking about modern North Korea

After World War II

Kim Il-Sung became a popular figure in North Korea especially due to the idea of self-reliance, uniting and hopeful. Due to objective factors such as 1950's Moscow style bureaucracy providing the blueprint for political development, and the ever-present existential threat posed by the nearby imperialist nations requiring the massive expansion of the state and military, the North Korean bureaucracy (largely with the support of the population) grew quite large. Over the next few decades, with imports of resources and technology from the USSR and China, the planned economy was able to industrialize North Korea very quickly. It wasn't until the seventies when the South began to receive imports of capital from imperialist nations that it was able to match the North in industrial capacity. It was also around this time that North Korea was having trouble managing its economy with a centrally governed authority, so its development plateaued

In the early nineties, leaving the North in a crisis of leadership. As happens in every country faced with a deep economic crisis with a state apparatus in crisis, either there is a revolution or the state consolidates even more power. So Kim Jong-Il came to power on top of the now massive state apparatus and decimated third-world economy. An interesting side note here, is that the rates of starvation and malnutrition at the worst point in North Korea were still not as bad as decent years in India and some other capitalist nations.

As much as I personally hate quoting Zizek

Now this is nothing new, North Korea had three resources, those being a rather large population/workforce, land that is somewhat fertile, and an immense, well-armed military and state apparatus. The important thing for both the survival of the state and the people was to end the famine and begin production of food on any scale; desperation was a key factor.

Now other areas of the world where unworked land was settled and no technological advancement had begun, most notably the colonies in the southern part of what is now the United States. The southern part of North America was, similar to North Korea, where the three main resources were guns, laborers and land. The development of resources relied on vast amounts of compulsory labor with the minimum advancement of capital. The class system in these instances developed differently, however. It is important to note that there is no slave owning class in North Korea, so the fact that it developed without private property does make it qualitatively different from these past slave societies. I will assert, that the modes of production, feudalist

The most obvious incarnation of the slave class is in the prison camps, criminals, and people disliked by the regime are sent to labor under horrid conditions for no pay under physical compulsion, that is slave labor. These slaves are watched over by government officials, or people without power themselves, carrying out the interests of those above them. These people and their class interests mirror those of the paid overseers in other slave societies.

Now, case is that of those in the DPRK incarnations of the iron rice bowl. Under Mao, the iron rice bowl would be a fairly self-contained society, where people would farm and be provided for on the basis of each collective. That is, people would get health care, food, shelter and other necessities through the collective and even be provided for in retirement. In the instance in the DPRK

Now, was the development of a class freed from the draining requirements of mundane labor. In the past, this led to an explosion in art, literature, philosophy, and science, due to leisure time given to those in positions of privilege. In the case of North Korea, military professionals,"" the fact that many of the missiles used by Iran

Unlike Rome, the DPRK is under an ever-present existential threat. Consolidation of political power was far less important in other slave societies (especially because the slave owning class had all of the political and economic power already). This is why these classes are manufactured and controlled by the state apparatus. This removes the typical manifestation of class contradictions and renders the oppression due to the bonapartist regime (bonapartist because it is defending the interests of the privileged class, which, without the state wouldn't even be conscious enough of their privilege to maintain it over those in the communes and prison camps). 

Thus

This idea occurred recently while reading about North Korea in an attempt to understand what is going on in that odd country. Clearly this is not a well developed theory, or hopefully, at the very least, I can serve as a catalyst to generate discussion on the path of the new hermit kingdom.",,False,,False,t3_vlwwc

I've recently taken the time to read through it and whilst doing so I found Sayers' discussion on the Hegelian tendency for existence to be looked upon in terms of the ideal quite interesting. I apologize for the lengthy quote:

&gt;The existing order is regarded as the imperfect and partial embodiment of the Notion or Ideal which is its real essence, and the world is judged and criticized in the light of how it ought to be.

&gt;I will illustrate these points with some recent examples; for the
Young Hegelian approach has not been confined to Hegel’s disciples
of the 1840s. It has had an enduring influence
unexpected places. For example
amongst the hardest of hard-liners
thought that they had much in common with the early Marx
alone with Hegel! It is particularly evident in the discussion of what
used to be called ‘actually existing socialist societies’
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (Bahro 1978). Often it is said
that these societies were not ‘genuinely’ socialist
‘true’ workers states. Of course
Hegelian terms
to have been
ideal—of socialism: they lacked ‘actuality’ and ‘rationality’. Some
people now say that since these societies had nothing to do with
‘true’ socialism

&gt;The manifestly non-ideal character of ‘actually existing’ socialist
states was
socialist thought. An all too common response on the left has been
to try to evade this problem by discounting these societies as
‘exceptions’ in the ways described. But this is clearly not a satisfactory
response. It involves abandoning altogether the scientific approach
to history and adopting instead a purely moral one. There can
course
composed of them they cease to be exceptions and become the stuff
and actuality of history. The ideal is then revealed as unreal
and subjective.

&gt;Not that this style of thought is any monopoly of the left. One of
the stranger products of the American far right is a writer called Ayn
Rand
individualism. Among her works is a book with the arresting
title
not simply to capture attention; it accurately reflects the theme of
the book. The ideal of capitalism is ‘unknown’
it has not yet been tried! The essence and the ideal of capitalism is
the free market. Capitalism
‘actually existing’ capitalism—has never realized this ideal. Laissezfaire
and the free market have always been restricted and
compromised
influence of muddled and weak humanitarian do-gooders
destructive features of capitalism—the exploitation, oppression and misery associated with it—are all the mere
aberrant and monstrous products of the mixed economy. Pure
capitalism

&gt;To write history in this way is,
however
reject actually existing socialist societies as ‘exceptions’
in thinking of socialism as an ‘unknown ideal’.

&gt;It is not the job of history or of the social sciences to criticize or
condemn societies according to ideal standards: rather
seek to understand and explain the real world as it has in fact
developed. The social sciences
to the world
of thought’ (Carr 1964:96). Socialists
the real world of socialism and come to terms with it
dismiss it as an aberration. In saying this
suggesting that they should abandon all criticism
everything that has gone under the name of socialism.

Cults of Personality, are frequently used by liberals to demonise socialism, communism and even Marxism, placing them alongside the abhorrent and anti-People ideologies of Nazism and Fascism in the dubious political category of 'totalitarianism'.  

The reasoning behind these personality cults from liberals (and this includes anarchists who make use of liberal, I think our analysis should be considerably more developed and rigorous. 

Thus, they should be combatted, whether they are in keeping with Marxism and the historic struggle towards Communism, whether they are necessary or desirable in the Developed World or a phenomena belonging to the Developing World; where the remnants of feudal culture and social relations are stronger than in America, Britain etc. and the effect it has on the formation of the Dictatorship of Proletariat are also interesting issue to discuss.

1331933718.0,qzyte,Educational Post: What is Capitalism?,,32,5,25,"Hello comrades!

This is a mod-approved *educational self-post.* It is intended to be a platform for discussion about a particular topic of Marxian theory. I do not pretend to be an expert in this arena, please see Marx's completed works and all Marxist theoretics generated since he stopped doing it himself.

One of the things I've noticed about discussions of Capitalism on leftist reddits is that the definition is often vulgarized and reduced to a single condition. The most common of these single conditions in my experience is the ""ownership of the means of production, some of which work in concert, and some of which are in opposition. The phrase for this aggregation is ""mode of production,"" a fancy term for the way a society makes things and reproduces itself.

The Capitalist mode of production is a system where relations between people are based on the production and exchange of commodities. A commodity is a useful thing that is produced for the purpose of exchange. The point of the exchange is to realize the value created in process of making the useful thing. That value is not realized and collected by the majority of the people who made the useful thing. Instead

The people who sell their labor power are called, as a group, the bourgeoisie or capitalists. Labor power is traded on a market like a commodity. Labor power is applied to the means of production (sometimes called fixed capital) and the stuff that is made is alienated from the people who exerted the labor to make it. That alienated labor is then, in part, sold by the capitalists back to the workers from whom it is alienated.

As the workers labor on the means of production, Capitalism is as system where the amount of value is *expanding*. It needs to grow or it ceases to work.

Again, the transitional mode of production between capitalism and communism, can look like. ",,False,,t5_2qolz,,http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/qzyte/educational_post_what_is_capitalism/

You have to invest in your future career by paying thousands of dollars for college level education just to end up being worked over by the bourgeoisie. All that happens is someone is investing in their career to pay back their student loan which leads to a load of high paid workers only working for money and not working towards the betterment of the citizens. In many socialist societies, working to pay off their loan and not working to better the community. It's no surprise that some socialist countries have the best doctors and workers because they are doing it to better themselves and the community instead of hoping to earn enough to one day pay off the debt they've accumulated. It's no surprise that there is such a gap in the class levels when the citizens are forced to invest in an education.

[This poster is obviously completely clueless about how anything works, the fact that it is part of a huge private corporation, the several websites that sell voting manipulation products and other services to help advertise on reddit, the utter refusal of the admins to handle the pedophilia, racist, misogynist forums and their open defense of them as free speech, you don't get to pretend none of it happened, and try to spin it like you do. Reddit is a cesspit and you're defending the cesspit. At least you were honest enough to do it while openly out of character

[So I don't know what a reactionary is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/147fx8/i_took_this_spy_photo_over_in_rcommunism_pinko/c7apny2) You should look at yourself in the mirror. Reactionaries are those that advocate a return to a prior mode of production

[You can't tell if I'm being facetious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/147fx8/i_took_this_spy_photo_over_in_rcommunism_pinko/c7akcns) Well guess what, a place for leftist politics, a place for dissent. And you won't have any dissent will you?  


You could never be so sophisticated enough to notice the irony of what you are doing.

The above is a table and two graphs

Hello, we can each come to terms with each others differences, and unite to combat capitalism. **Please Read the Personal Plea at the bottom.**

Here are my findings.

**Procedure:** 

* I used Metareddit to find as many Leftist subreddits as I could.

* Here

* Once I had my subreddits, as well as the size of the subreddit (in subscribers).

* I used 29 days instead of one month because when a post is labeled ""one month old"" on reddit

* In my report I have eight fields: Name, Size, Posts in the last month, Comments in the last month, Comment to post ratio, and Activity Index.

* Name: The name of the subreddit.

* Subreddit Rules/Sidebar: The official rules or statement.

* Personal Commentary: My own interpretation or observation of the subreddit. Note that many of these I am a complete foreigner to, or missing entirely.

* Size: The size of the subscriber base.

* Posts in the last month: Posts made in the last 29 days.

* Comments in the last month: Comments made in the last 29 days. This data will be slightly off

* Comment to Post Ratio: The Comments divided by the Posts in the last month. the Specific formula is Comments/(Posts + 1). One was added to posts to prevent a Divide by Zero error. It did not impact the data enough to justify its removal.

* Activity index: This is a ranking of the most active subreddits. Each was given a number based on the activity of submitting and discussion. The specific formula is (Posts/29)+(Comments/29)

**Findings:**

**/r/communism**

* Size: 3129

* Posts in Last Month: 261

* Comments in Last Month: 2020

* Comment to Post Ratio: 7.11

* Activity Index: 78.66

I am proud to call /r/communism my home subreddit. It is the one I check eagerly everyday. Even though I am not the most perfect communist

**Fun Facts**

* Total Subreddits analyzed: 87

* Highest Activity Index: /r/Anarchism

* Lowest Activity Index: Too many tied for this position. Many Subreddits have just stopped.

* Highest Comment to Post Ratio: /r/Pyongyang. I experienced some weirdness when investigating this one. I reviewed all the subreddits multiple times, each post having over 200 comments.

* Second Highest Comment to Post Ratio: /r/DebateaCommunist. One of my Favorite subreddits

* Lowest Comment to Post Ratio: Again

* Largest Subreddit: /r/Anarchism 

* Second Largest Subreddit: /r/FirstWorldAnarchists

* Third Largest Subreddit: /r/socialism 

* Smallest Subreddit: /r/SRSAnarchism

* Weirdest Subreddit: /r/PonyAnarchism. It was a tie between this and /r/Capitalist_Communism

I believe that we can revitalize some of these smaller and more inactive subreddits. To this end....

**Some Smaller

Just as a note

* /r/Agitation: Here, Communism, or Anarchism.

* /r/alltheleft: Trying to unite all the left!

* /r/Debateacommunist: Another beloved subreddit

* /r/Anarchy101: Like /r/Debateacommunist

* /r/askacommunist: Very small

* /r/CPUSA: In the United States? New to Communism in the states? CPUSA is here to welcome you!

* /r/Hoxhaism: Could use more content and users.

* /r/IWW: The international Workers of the World! A great organization

* /r/Leninism: Same as Hoxhaism.

* /r/marx

* /r/Marxism: I feel that we should take better effort to improve the quality of this subreddit.

* /r/PrisonReform. Seriously

* /r/redstatereds: I know your out there. I'm stuck in the South

* /r/RuralLeft: Same as /r/redstatereds

* /r/RiseoftheSovietUnion: I haven't checked this place out too much other than preliminary research

* /r/ShittyDebateCommunism

* /r/smallrevolutions: Revolution in the palm of your hand! With more activity and users

* /r/Socialism: we could use some more representation here.

* /r/SPUSA: This place is dead

* /r/anarchocommunism: This one has a brand new mod. Get in there and support him. Even though we are Marxist Communist

* and many more!

**Personal Plea**

I know that those of us who favor /r/communism do not have the best reputation. I seek to change that. The only way to Revolution is if we go together. Live together or die alone. That is the hope behind this report. A hope that the left can unite.

If you have seen my thread on /r/Socialism, that actually has had good moderation. I have never been banned for disagreeing with the group. I don't think that I have even seem this happen.
We should go out there to places like /r/Marxism, and /r/Communismforall and others and show that /r/Communism is not only dedicated to Marxist discussion, but it is also for *everyone* to come and learn from that discussion. It is our duty, as members of /r/communism to cooperate and organize with other communists, even if we disagree on things. Solidarity is our most powerful weapon, and we need to arm ourselves.
I realize that most of the people who are turned off from /r/communism are turned off because they disagree with the rules. We must continue to educate them, for surely they are in great need of education. To that end, I suggest we relax. Just to be clear, I am not suggesting a relaxation in the moderation policy. The mods have been firm, and that is why we are a success. Look into my report, and look at the activity indexes of most Anarchist subreddit. It is clear that the mods have done an excellent job. I feel that we need to in crease our efforts to treat visitors with respect, to keep it clean, we must do it with good character. We must be kind and courteous
Well
I am sorry

Ultimately

I am sorry if I offended anyone

&gt;The opponents of communism have always described it as a process of sharing things out equally. They declared that the communists wanted to confiscate everything and to divide everything up; to parcel out the land, such a general division is impossible. We could share out land, horses and cattle, money, but could not share out railways, machinery, steamboats, such a division, the same old cycle would be reproduced.

&gt;Proletarian communism (or proletarian socialism) is a huge cooperative commonwealth. It is a sequence of the whole development of capitalist society and of the condition of the proletariat in that society. It must be carefully distinguished from the four following things [I've omitted the other three]

&gt;1. Lumpenproletarian socialism (anarchism). The anarchists reproach the communists on the ground that communism (so they contend) will maintain the State authority in the future society. As we have seen, not of a huge cooperative commonwealth, but of a great number of 'free', small, self-governing communes. It need hardly be said that such a social system would fail to liberate mankind from nature's yoke, for in it the forces of production would not be developed even to the degree to which they have been developed under capitalism. Anarchism would not increase production, but would disintegrate it. It is natural that, the anarchists should advocate the dividing up of articles of consumption and should oppose the organization of large-scale production. They do not, but who are quite incapable of independent creative work.

I thought that was very thought-provoking. What are your thoughts?

The kind that thinks that we are ""suppressing dissent"" in this forum. What the fuck do these people think dissent is? If it is deviating from the norm, with their brave ""socially accepted opinions"" (which is usually sexist, racist shit, or just capitalistic ramblings), and forming big invading mobs to shout us down.  

Yes, and the others silenced. That it is just an excuse to parade reactionary opinions on this forum.  

Nevermind that our latest invaders hide behind the pretense of being a parody filled with reactionary, imperialistic terrorist state of America be made fun of (the whole point of their usual parody) - their prevalent real world islamophobia - someone runs in and reminds them that their serious, reactionary mccarthyist agenda is incompatible with that. We are dealing with more traditional cold warriors here who, when it comes down to it, are very serious about some kind of juvenile conservative, nationalistic internet activism.  

And what of the reddit admins? I'm sure their own policies against downvote brigades and this kind of practice that completely disrupts day to day activity in a political forum doesn't matter to them because they are a bunch of reactionary shits, racist and other awful communities that their fascist audience breeds and upholds. I wonder if /r/murica invaded those awful subreddits all of the reddit reactionaries would take it in stride. Well I know they wouldn't, we saw how they defended these communities up until the last second as free speech.  

So we get it reddit. You have made it clear that when you mean free speech you mean reactionary, and nothing else. Any dissent from this is going to be reviled by the wider community and, as we saw in this latest forum invasion, effectively censored.  

And some of you in this forum will still try to score points with reactionaries in other boards when they complain about any moderation whatsoever. Do you think these fuckers would ever have anything positive to say about our community otherwise? The only compliments they would give us would be whenever we decided to drop any semblance of a communist ideology and accept their shitty uninformed arguments. For those comrades who rather than be principled and stand along with your comrades

What all the efforts of these reactionaries reveal is that they are legitimately bothered, and this is by far the best aspect of it. And this is the most satisfying of all. They may hide behind their appearance of humor and parody, but they are just bitter, angry and frustrated (as it is often revealed after they are banned and they keep harassing us in private, and as is revealed by the threads in their forums, and by the politics in their posts).

As per the recommendations in the recent [this-is-a-feminist-forum post](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/129qew/rcommunism_is_a_feminist_subreddit/) (yay us!) I checked out Dworkin's ""I Want a Twenty-Four-Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape"" and I also stumbled upon Frantz Fanon's *The Wretched of the Earth*. This has come after weeks of reading Harvey, Rose, Smith, Thrift, Pred, and a whole bunch of other social theorist geographers of many flavors (not just Marxist, although many are). But nothing prepared me for the soul shakedown I got from the Dworkin-Fanon one-two punch.

Something in Sartre's preface to Fanon struck a nerve:
&gt;Fanon reveals to his comrades—above all to some of them who are rather too Westernized—the solidarity of the people of the mother country and of their representatives in the colonies. Have the courage to read this book, as Marx said, is a revolutionary sentiment.

The shame I felt was overwhelming, even expressing that sentiment was met with bewilderment and incredulity, and so I thought that that was enough, to say that Yes, I'm A Feminist—Ask Me About It like I was a member of some weird cult wearing a sandwich board on a corner downtown.

But that's not enough, that has only brought me to action. Shame is a revolutionary sentiment because it causes a person to act (and what is the revolution without action, praxis?). Even though this first action is small—a self-post thread on a medium-small subreddit—it's something, and that's definitely more than the nothing I was doing before. (Well okay, not nothing. I do try to heap all kinds of revolutionary thought upon the freshmen that I teach in hopes of getting them to think more critically about the world and challenge the narratives presented to them [including mine.])

Fanon, I haven't read that much of it yet (just the conclusion, Sartre's preface, and the first few pages of chapter 1), but it has already helped address some issues I've had in the past. As I became socially conscious in college, increasingly aware of the myriad social inequalities around me and in my experience, I was strictly tied to the nonviolent revolution. Disclaimer: I've long since abandoned that vow but I've had long talks with my comrade who is a major part of his university's RSU about violence and what violence does and the nature of violence and the place of violence and everything wrapped up in it. My own research has even touched on some of these themes. What Fanon did for me though was to literally *wake me the fuck up*. 

When the revolution comes, rise against/up, destroy, banish, oppressors, seize, struggle, reproach, symbols, the revolution will be so utterly and transformatively *violent* in its realization that no stone of our society will be left atop another.

I'm 15 and in the 9th grade.  Years ago, which I was interested in at the time.  Then there was the super tall friend who was literally the most intelligent person I've ever met.  It's a close call between him and the Talented Asshole (in case he's reading this, I mean that in the nicest possible way).

Anyway, and he was the first one to really make me question my beliefs.  Tall Kid and I would talk about our religion, and our lives, and our futures late at night before going to bed, and those are the times I remember most.  Often, Talented Asshole would join in as well.

Eventually

Flash forward to September 2011.  September 8th.  I've just suffered a break-up with my first girlfriend.  My faith in God is crumbling and has been for months.  My faith in everything else is starting to crumble as well.  A man enters my engineering classroom.

After the years of friendship, the companionship, the ultimate separation, had all culminated in this moment.

My Tall Friend was dead.  He had shot himself that morning between 7 and 8 A.M.

I broke.  The entire world changed from a bit on the cranky side to a full on douchebag

I began to realize God was not showing up for me.  The Talented Asshole and I were back on friendly terms, doesn't really work"" response, to which he replied that communism as it was intended hasn't really been put into practice yet.  At first I was tentative in my acceptance of socialism, but I came to accept it eventually.  Communism, to be honest, isn't something I'm ready to accept yet, but I may be based on what I learn in the future.

My newfound disdain for religion and hope in socialism caused me to see the people around me with new eyes.  I had changed, all sense of belonging, and nearly all hope.  But the Talented Asshole and I remained friends.

Today

""He was a communist

I looked at him.  I was realizing that My Talented Asshole Friend hadn't started communism in my city.  It went farther than that.  The people that were rejecting him and me, but that I now did.

He was a communist

Anger welled up inside me

They killed him.  They're damn close to doing the same to me.  But they won't.  The sacred war is going.  I'm not letting them win.

I would like to bring attention to two excellent, and [London's Burning: The Revolt of the Youth](http://www.revcom.us/a/242/AWTWNS_london_burning-en.html) by A World to Win News Service. 

The World People's Resistance Movement on France 2005:

&gt; It serves no purpose and is beside the point to dwell on the ‘imperfections’ of their rebellion. This is a spontaneous revolt of those at the very bottom who have taken the stage of history even though they have not yet had the opportunity to fully develop their political understanding, that they do not intend to abide by the rules nor allow their voices to be silenced.

Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committee) on the ""wrong targets"" of revolt in France:

&gt; Some “leftist” activists claimed that the rebels should not be supported because they hit “wrong targets”, I’m looking for a school training programme. I went to see a guidance counsellor. She suggested that I become a maid. I’m 17 and she tells me to become a maid – that’s ridiculous!” In fact, even a union bureaucrat realised that “these actions are symbolic. A lot of trust is put in the school system, which is supposed to be a social elevator. To burn it down means that it doesn’t work. [Youth] turn against it because it deceived them.”

A World to Win on international influences in 2011 revolt:

&gt; But at the heart of this welter of contradictions, that they might have to drop out of college due to the recent massive hike in education fees, and that they considered themselves ""revolutionaries."" One question in the air: how much were the youth influenced by the rebellions in the Middle East and North Africa?

On the contradictions and solidarity which emerges through common struggle:

&gt; The masses taking part in this revolt or out on its fringes are full of the contradictions that come from being part of capitalist society, and was especially upset at the looting of local shops, but when her son and his mates showed up with a bag of new clothes for her, she was delighted: I'm on benefits, we've got nothing, she explained. Mothers struggled with their young sons and daughters not to go out, but shouted with glee when they saw projectiles strike home on a police van. A middle aged Iraqi political refugee clutched to his chest his valuable personal documents that he’d salvaged, but was torn by sympathy for the youth

**If you say Stalin or stalinists aren't communist
This counts for Lenin, Left-Communists too, but 80% of the time it's Stalin. So this is where we draw the line to separate us from the other leftist forums on reddit. Now when we ban sectarians we're just linking here and pointing to how instructions in the sidebar weren't followed, so it's their own fault.  
Help us fight rampant sectarianism that hinders discussion comrades!  
Let us criticize history and attempts to build socialism without resorting to cheap debating tactics, and actually apply our critical thinking and knowledge.  
So people don't get to call whatever they don't like stalinism
**I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR**  
**ಠ_ಠ**  

Edit: **CRITICAL
What we want to avoid is people who triumphantly declare something that they disagree with ""This is Stalinism!""  
Or ""Ha! This is as shitty as Pol-Pot!""  
""Lol @ North Korea!""  
""Mao killed half of the living things in China!""
""Trotskyists never did anything!""  
""Leninists are authoritarian and thus we should reject them!""  
We DO NOT want to stifle discussion. We actually want people to discuss things, Communist Party of Japan or whatever.  
  
Edit 2: To make this clear  
**R/COMMUNISM DOES NOT SUPPORT STALINISM OR ANY OTHER LINE**
we merely want discussions to escape the common place shitslinging that goes on in other forums and turn every conversation into something a little richer by forcing arguments to be more sophisticated.  
so **WE ARE NOT SUPPRESSING DISSENT**, and even complain about the people he killed, without merely pointing out ""Stalin killed a lot of people! If that isn't enough for you to not support him you're insane!"" and other assorted arguments about any other line that is also not stalinist that you disagree with. You can say ""Well, stalinism probably went more overboard with the killing, I don't know if that ended up being more important than whatever good the regime did over it's lifetime and ultimately stalinism was hurtful for the cause, but I understand that one can still rescue theoretical principles present within it"" or w/e.

But N Korea is often associated with Communism(as that is what they officially have) and so I think we should have an opinion on it.

My opinion on matters of the world are to be 3rd party viewership. To be babylonian. An eye for an eye. Right and wrong.

I personally believe and have seen that Americans really do not know the actual story of Korea.

Let's go back in time. In the 50's

What happened at the 38th parallel wasn't fair to the N Koreans. They liberated themselves from the Japanese and now they won't be able to get their country back? The term 'puppet' army has been used a lot during that time and in the films today. That term would best be applied to the S. Koreans at the time. Who were at the mercy of the dictator and U.S forces to fuel a proxy war that was ultimately wrongful imperialism.

So let's go into IF's right now. IF the PRC took the ROC and the DPRK took the ROK. The number of tensions would not be here right now. Right now the ROK and ROC and SOJ are pro U.S. But if that wasn't the case

Here's why. The Soviets and the Chinese more or less dropped support of N Korea after its failed war. It was too expensive. The Western powers would then go on to embargo DPRK and not give it oil. A needed substance that their industrialization needed.
This all happened because the war was not won. If the war was to happen without U.S intervention

With an unified country, such anxiety would not have happened.

Those are my thoughts on N. Korea. Where Western Imperialism and hipocrocies in dealing with DPRK caused the current mess. Millions of soldiers and citizens would not have had to perished and the current situation with DPRK may not even happen as the DPRK would have more bargaining rights before the west illegally embargoed it.
---

Just today

A unbiased view where you look at the issue as a 3rd party and not an American. 

They are mearley trying to get more bargaining power

But in Western Media views

The Government has done some questionable things

All to often, and War isn't about who is right but who is left. But when we get to a present debate, they read directly from the media, they call the government crazy, and that they are evil bastards.

The problem isn't actually with biased media. It's with media that doesn't care to give the facts of the other side. The info that is reported IS true. But it is so clean of info that it leaves the readers thoughts on that country to take over their senses.

This is something enviromentalists do. For example they can talk about millions of gallons of water used in fracking. The average reader would perceive this as being so much water being wasted and bad. They will thus rise up. But the actuality of it is

But anyway

&gt; In 1951

""Interesting!"", I kept reading about this, jumping to the page about the [CPGB's programme itself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain%27s_Road_to_Socialism). There I found that, apparently:

&gt; The first edition of the document received the personal approval of Joseph Stalin prior to publication.

Considering the document called for things like:

&gt; Britain's Road to Socialism proposes that socialism can be achieved in Britain by the working class leading the other classes in a popular democratic anti-monopoly alliance against monopoly capital, such as Trades Unions, Trades Union Councils and tenant's associations.

it seemed odd for Stalin to support such clear case of Western revisionism. So I kept reading, Stalin advices Pollitt:

&gt; The draft of the programme correctly puts forward the task of utilising the traditional English institutions (Parliament) in the struggle for socialism. It is well known that the English Communists are being accused that they will establish Soviet Power in England. Hence it is imperative that in the draft of the programme it should be very clearly and definitely stated that the English Communists are not going to delegitimise Parliament
that would be guided by peoples’ power and not by capitalists; peoples’ power representing a coalition of working class as the leading force of the coalition

This seems pretty damning, with Stalin endorsing other practices such as voting for Labor in districts where the Communists could not present their own candidates, etc). So what do you think? Is this another case of people falling for ""Western exceptionalism""? Was Stalin just doing a bit of realpolitik, pushing for un-Marxist policies because they would benefit the USSR in the short term? Is there more to this that I'm missing?

I was taken aback, but suggested that we dedicate a meeting to studying the civil war, focusing on Lenin's, Trotsky's, just an introduction that wouldn't take longer than 30 - 60 minutes (our meetings are an hour.)

In this era of imperialism and drastic exploitation of the third-world

* Are first world workers exploiting third world workers? How may they do it consciously?
* How should first-world workers be classified? Are they proletarians or labor aristocrats?

These are some basic and maybe not very good questions. I do not know much about Third-worldism but would like to see some discussion and learn more.

The central committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan announces with immense and profound sadness and sorrow the death of Comrade Hafiz, Maoist parties and organizations of the world, and the entire international communist movement. 

Comrade Hafiz was a veteran of the new democratic movement in Afghanistan. He started his political and revolutionary activities in the ranks of the Sholajawid movement in the 1960s while he was a high school student. He remained committed to the line and objectives of the movement even after the movement’s collapse. When the Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) led the reprehensible April coup in 1978

In 1984, along with several other comrades, formed the Committee for MLM Propaganda and Agitation that published the journal Shola. This journal played a significant role in the propagation of the Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. In the late 1980s, when the Committee for the Consolidation and Unity of the Communist Movement of Afghanistan was formed by joint efforts of the Communist Revolutionary Cell of Afghanistan and the Committee for MLM Propaganda and Agitation, comrade Hafiz participated as the representative of the group under his leadership. The Committee for Consolidation and Unity expanded with the participation of the Marxist-Leninist Alliance--Mao Zedong thought faction and the Organization to Struggle for the Liberation of Afghanistan. 

In 1991, Comrade Hafiz led an émigré committee of the supporters of the Communist Party of Afghanistan. In 1993 he was a member of the delegation of the Communist Party of Afghanistan in the second Expanded Meeting of RIM that ratified and issued the document Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism; in that meeting our comrade played a distinguished revolutionary role.

Comrade Hafiz was a representative of the Communist Party of Afghanistan in the 2004 Unity Congress of the Communist (MLM) movement in which he was elected as a member of the central committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan. While leading an émigré unit of party supporters, RIM’s journal and also RIM’s internal publications into Farsi-Dari.

The central committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan expresses its solemn condolences over the immense loss of this veteran comrade to members and supporters of the party

The problem is that everyone seems to share their books through file-upload services like MegaUpload, Fileget, and so on. These links expire quickly, and they're not very effective for easily sharing large libraries between people.

Large libraries can be shared easily through torrents on sites like OneBigTorrent

In the past, because I too have a list of books I've been looking for and have been totally unable to find, like Fraser &amp; Wilde's ""Marx Dictionary."" I've also gotten into the habit of re-formatting PDFs and e-textbooks in ways more suitable for use on e-readers and mobile devices, which I'm sure there's demand for.

The best system I've found so far is a **Calibre library** served over the web. That option produces a neat little website [like this](http://i.imgur.com/uZS09tZ.png), Kindle, HTML, plaintext) with a displayed cover and description. That's a great feature, because it means users don't need to have a book in mind -- they can see what's available and research what seems striking. They could email their own ebooks to the person running the library to expand it. The disadvantage here is that it's centralised and openly on display, pretty easy for copyright holders to simply order it shut down. 

My other idea was to cross-post a monthly thread in /r/communism, /r/radicalchristianity, /r/criticaltheory, /r/srssocialism, /r/communism101, /r/anarchy101 (and so on) in which users can ask for books they've been after, recommend non-obvious books, or by forwarding them all to someone who posts them as one big convenient reliable torrent). There have been individual book-sharing threads here, and the links die off -- it needs to be a monthly thing

In actually existing socialism of the 20th century, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in consolidating the status of the proletariat as the ruling class.

Despite that, and the main reason there is a so-called ""transition stage"" between capitalism and communism.

I would like to discuss this here. Is the Cultural Revolution and the different struggles therein the answer that is applicable everywhere? No one wishes to argue that there weren't massive successes, be ascribed to the material conditions of that time? 

In addition, and we must work hard to combat the shroud of mystification it brings with it. This cannot be done if communists everywhere arm themselves more and more with contemporary developments in economics, such as the TSSI. In the end, if we don't study these things, who will?

**The June Revolution
The Course of the Paris Uprising**

by Frederick Engels

Translated: by the Marx-Engels Institute;
First published: in Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 32
Transcribed: by director@marx.org

Gradually we gain a more comprehensive view of the June Revolution; fuller reports arrive, the more is one astonished by the vast magnitude of the uprising, the heroic courage, the rapidly improvised organization and the unanimity of the insurgents.

The workers' plan of action, is said to have drawn up, was as follows:

The insurgents

The first column, advance southwards from the gates of Poissonniere, Rochechouart, St. Denis and La Villette, occupy the Boulevards and approach the town hall through the streets Montorgueil, St. Denis and St. Martin.

The second column, advance towards the same centre through the streets du Temple and St. Antoine and along the quais of the northern bank of the Seine as well as through all other streets running in the same direction in this part of the city.

The third column based on the Faubourg St. Marceau move towards the Ile de la Cite through the Rue St. Victor and the quais of the southern bank of the Seine.

The fourth column, cross to the right bank of the Seine and envelop the town hall from the rear and flank.

Thus the plan, which surrounds the entire eastern half of Paris, widening out towards the east. First of all the eastern part of Paris was to be cleared of enemies, and then it was intended to move along both banks of the Seine towards the west and its centres, the Tuileries and the National Assembly.

These columns were to be supported by numerous flying squads which, occupy the smaller streets and be responsible for maintaining communication.

The operational bases were strongly fortified and skillfully transformed into formidable fortresses, the Faubourg and Quartier St. Antoine and the Faubourg St. Jacques, in case it should become necessary to retreat.

If there was any flaw in this plan it was that in the beginning of the operations the western part of Paris was completely overlooked. There are several districts eminently suitable for armed action on both sides of the Rue St. Honore near the market halls and the Palais National, thus cutting off the town hall and at the same time holding up a considerable number of troops at this projecting strongpoint. The success of the uprising depended on the insurgents reaching the centre of Paris as quickly as possible and seizing the town hall. We cannot know what prevented Kersausic from organizing insurgent action in this part. But it is a fact that no uprising was ever successful which did not at the outset succeed in seizing the centre of Paris adjoining the Tuileries. Suffice to mention the uprising [The uprising took place in Paris on June 5-6, 1832. -- Ed.]"" which took place during General Lamarque's funeral when the insurgents got as far as the Rue Montorgueil and were then driven back.

The insurgents advanced in accordance with their plan. They immediately began to separate their territory, by two main fortifications -- the barricades at the Porte Saint Denis and those of the Cite. They were dislodged from the former, but were able to hold the latter. June 23, the first day, was merely a prelude. The plan of the insurgents already began to emerge clearly (and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung grasped it correctly at the outset, see No. 26, special supplement), which crosses the line of operation of the first column, ended with a victory for the forces of ""order"".

The approaches to the Cite were blocked on the right by a flying squad

The plan of the forces of ""order"" stood out even more clearly than that of the insurgents. To begin with

But the government believed it was dealing with an uncouth gang of common rioters acting without any plan. After clearing the main streets by the evening

The insurgents made excellent use of this negligence by launching the great battle which followed the skirmishes of June 23. It is simply amazing how quickly the workers mastered the plan of campaign

On the morning of the 24th they had not only completely regained the ground they had lost, thus cutting off the first column from the centre, but on the other hand the second column pushed forward from the Quartier St. Antoine until it almost surrounded the town hall. It established its headquarters in the church of St. Gervais, within 300 paces of the town hall. It captured the St. Merri monastery and the adjoining streets and advanced far beyond the town hall so that together with the columns in the Cite it almost completely encircled the town hall. Only one way of approach, the quais of the right bank, remained open. In the south the Faubourg St. Jacques was completely reoccupied, communication with the Cite' was restored, and preparations were made for crossing to the right bank.

There was no time to be lost. The town hall

&gt; They're mostly from former Soviet Republics in Central Asia. Uzbeks, but not allowed to work. That's why their engagements are almost exclusively in the shadow market, their employers hide them away in underground bunkers and working conditions resemble slave labour. However, those guys are still comparatively happy about it as they can earn more there than in their home countries and send money to their families at home.

The nightmarish logic of free market capitalism in Russia:

&gt; Another thing to note. Factory owners routinely enslave these illegal migrants. They lock them inside big buildings and have them work on garments and instruments for years on end. Most of these migrants are comprised of poor Asian and Indian women / children who migrated there for a better world only to get locked up. The people who control these operations rarely get busted due to strong political ties. This is why Moscow allows illegal migration to go on; it's just like slavery with all the benefits and none of the losses. Google it and you will see heartbreaking videos.

1355663524.0,14xv4o,Rosa Luxemburg's critique of Bernstein (revisionism): Reform or Revolution? (chapter one),JasonMacker,37,15,1,"A little backstory...

Prior to World War One

On one side was Eduard Bernstein, the working class will gradually gain class consciousness simply by arguing for better wages, working conditions, etc. As far as he was concerned, there was no tipping point. Things will just keep getting better and better for workers, indefinitely:

""The final aim of socialism

That is what he said.

And looking back at history, have become failures or ghosts of their former selves. Every single time.

Why does this happen?

The answer is that the Big Picture is lost. When you zoom in on a small skirmish

When the big picture, until we reach the point where either the working class has more collective capital than the bourgeoisie, or until they refuse to raise wages any higher, at which case revolution is necessary."" That broader perspective is lost when the simple-minded mantra of ""must only care about raising my wages"" is pumped and promoted without any context.

We see this not just on the class (proletarian vs bourgeoisie) front, race, etc.) as well. 

Rosa Luxemburg addresses this in the very first paragraph of her pamphlet *[Reform or Revolution](http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/intro.htm)* (1900):

&gt;&gt;At first view the title of this work may be found surprising. Can the Social-Democracy be against reforms? Can we contrapose the social revolution, to social reforms? Certainly not. The daily struggle for reforms, for the amelioration of the condition of the workers within the framework of the existing social order, and for democratic institutions, offers to the Social-Democracy an indissoluble tie. The struggle for reforms is its means; the social revolution, its aim.

And it's with this theme that Rosa Luxemburg writes the rest of this pamphlet: While reform is important

In Chapter One she talks about opportunism and how Bernstein is rejecting scientific socialism:

&gt;&gt;The scientific basis of socialism rests, on the growing anarchy of capitalist economy, leading inevitably to its ruin. Second, on the progressive socialisation of the process of production, which creates the germs of the future social order. And third, on the increased organisation and consciousness of the proletarian class, which constitutes the active factor in the coming revolution.

&gt;&gt;Bernstein pulls away from the first of the three fundamental supports of scientific socialism. He says that capitalist development does not lead to a general economic collapse.

&gt;&gt;He does not merely reject a certain form of the collapse. He rejects the very possibility of collapse. He says textually: “One could claim that by collapse of the present society is meant something else than a general commercial crisis, because capitalist development increases on the one hand the capacity of adaptation and, on the other – that is at the same time, the differentiation of industry.” (Neue Zeit, 1897-98, vol.18, pg.555)

We know today, or the most recent economic crises. But it doesn't take a dedicated intellectual to simply review major events in history. Luxemburg's argument for the inevitability of economic collapse was *before* any of the events of the 20th century took place. How did she know in advance? The answer is that she knew because of using historical materialist analysis, as Marx and Engels argued and did themselves.

Revisionism is self-refuting and is ultimately not *socialist*

&gt;&gt;Revisionist theory thus places itself in a dilemma. Either the socialist transformation is, and with the growth of capitalism will develop its inner contradictions, resulting inevitably, at some point, in its collapse, (in that case the “means of adaptation” are ineffective and the theory of collapse is correct); or the “means of adaptation” will really stop the collapse of the capitalist system and thereby enable capitalism to maintain itself by suppressing its own contradictions. In that case socialism ceases to be an historic necessity. It then becomes anything you want to call it, but it is no longer the result of the material development of society.

Again

And that's why you can look at all the ""Leftist"" parties and see that they've drifted all the way entirely from class struggle. Bernstein himself would probably be flabbergasted by all the neo-liberal and Third-Wayist and other such bullshit that **self-proclaimed ""Labor"" parties and ""Social democrat"" parties** of modern times promote! If he was brought back to life today I wouldn't be surprised if the first thing that comes to his mind is an apology to Luxemburg and an admission of being incorrect. Or maybe I'm being too generous of him?

Share your thoughts on that or on any part of this in general. Thanks.

So today the people of Greece went to the polls and a bare plurality voted to empower a group of bourgeois fucks that literally want to sell the nation to Chinese corporations in order to pay off German bankers for loans they took out to finance stupid Greek businessmens' decisions from five years ago. Unfortunately for the Greek people and the German bankers the Chinese corporations have no interest in buying Greece at the price they have been offered.

The competition to the option of ""selling the country to Chinese rich people to pay off German rich people who lent too much money to Greek rich people"" was the mislabeled ""coalition of the radical left, and a salting of so called Maoists and Communists. The NYT called it occupy + Ralph Nader which I gotta say really sounds about right. While it's leader claims that Hugo Chavez is his hero, I've rarely seen a slimy pol run right faster than this clown did. SYRIZA basically offered the Greek people the option of paying off the German rich people but at a better rate and without selling the country to Chinese rich people. Alas, the Greek people didn't believe them, probably because the Greek masses are smart enought to know how badly they are fucked. When the left offers a shit sandwich with sugar on top the masses are likely going to say ""no thanks, the shit sandwich without sugar seems more nutritious"". 

Of course there is an actual honest to god communist party in Greece, who function as a threat. And then there are the Anarchists, who have no solutions, but who have the saving grace of throwing a fuckin burning molotov at all the right people.

Elections don't work in situations like this. Period. The only answer is organizing outside of and against the system that was able to transform SYRIZA from a marginally anti-Euro party into Pasok in a few weeks. Here in the US we just had a famous recall election in WI. The target of that recall

The lesson to be learned is that elections are the enemy's turf. Don't participate. Don't play that game. And make sure you cast a skeptical eye on *anyone* on the left who does at this historical moment.

This is generally an ultra-leftist sentiment, and they're now useless in the face of modern capitalism.

How do comrades feel about this? I personally find it to be a ridiculous fantasy. Systems such as Leninism, they're revolutionary strategies for defeating capitalism and then establishing socialism. To throw them out the window while awaiting some far-off revolution would be to commit intellectual suicide, to lose decades of experience, and it would pretty much condemn us to starting all over with our theories.

In addition, and so we may as well not lift a finger until the time comes. These are the same people who condemned the Bolsheviks for taking action against Tsarism because it ""wasn't the right time."" Almost always the people advocating waiting until the situation ""becomes revolutionary enough"" have an incredibly subjective idea of what constitutes a revolutionary situation, or no idea at all.

These are my thoughts. What do you guys think? And if I've misrepresented my opponents' viewpoint

EDIT: While I'm on the subject,"" is usually their cry. I believe these comrades are missing the point. It is highly important to analyze the history of the Soviet Union for two reasons:

1) The bourgeoisie will lie about it. They constantly use the USSR is an example of how socialism cannot work

2) It is relevant to the question of tactics. If it was Lenin's theories such as the vanguard party that resulted in the Soviet Union collapsing, then Lenin's theories are fine for rallying the proletariat, but we must be sure to have democracy once we're victorious.

It's part of the current five year plan. They draft the plan every five years but of course they also predict longer term trends. This has to do with even development

1 - increased productivity in agricultural production allows for a smaller rural population to create a bigger agricultural surplus to supply the cities

2 - the increased productivity in agricultural production is proportional to the direct investment made in agricultural industrialization

3 - more labor is needed do propel industrial production in the cities further

I can make a few conclusions based on those points:

1 - for better or worse

2 - industrial production seems to be the locus of social tensions in china at the moment and it tends to increase at least for another decade

3 - the growing service sector also means the growth of a labor aristocracy within china

4 - as for a longer term trend

What we can expect China to do in the next five year plans to come is to react both to the social tensions industrial production is generating and to the growing cost of industrial production due to the decreasing marginal rates of resource intensive production. So they will attempt to emphasize the financialization of the economy, as well as base resources for industrial production. The growth of the service sector and the financialization of the economy is capitalism's solution to the unbearable social tension created by the labor conditions of a country that underwent the process of industrialization, and also the response to the growing scarcity of resources.

Rosa Luxemburg, she looked ahead to the inevitable triumph of socialism. Her brief final statement ends with a defiant and powerful salvo at the German authorities:

I find this completely repulsing. Is it incorrect? No. 

But what it is doing is the following example:

Jaws comes out and scares millions into being scared of sharks.
And then

That is basically what I see. It isn't wrong

Media will often add background info on some 'intersting things' in the article. But what I see less of is background info on the 'other side of things'. For example

It is just something I am getting sick of. Background info that uses words that are known to get people riled up and is also part of a 'enemy-ally' system that was used heavily in ___ nation years ago. 

I wish to read articles on China where over half of them don't feel the need to mention that the article was from 'state media' or what the actions of 'state officials' are to the issue and how it is run under the 'Communist party of China'.

Do I see articles that mention the U.K go into background history on how their Queen is granted the power to rule by the power of God and how their officials in Africa that are sent as represenatives(theoretically) of the Queen are thus workers of God?

See how that idea above makes you go ಠ_ರೃ as in it doesn't make any sense? Yeah. That's how I feel. Useless hateful info that just incites comments about jobs for America

This event had been ridiculed by rightists who only dwell on shortcomings as adventurist due to having been influenced too much by Charu Mazumdar's ""annihilation of class enemies"" line. 

This event was later considered one of the cornerstones in the Nepali Communist Movement by the CPN(Maoist) for having broken with decades long revisionism and actually launching armed struggle.

&gt;  In 1967, then, that the influence of this movement would quickly spread into the adjoining areas of Nepal itself. In 1971, in the Jhapa district of eastern Nepal, a local section of the NCP split off and began a Naxalbari-type armed struggle. Although the movement had great historical significance, it could not develop into a people's war. The leadership of the NCP denounced the movement as ""ultra-left"", despite its importance. Under the blows of the enemy, later rejoining the main revisionist party.

A World To Win

&gt; The armed struggle of 1972-73 in Jhapa, it was however an important far-reaching rebellion against the autocratic feudal rule of the king and against the rightist reformist tendencies that had become deeply entrenched in the Nepalese communist movement. In the armed struggle to pursue the new democratic revolution the martyrs of the Jhapa rebellion will remain in the forefront.

&gt;  After the 1960 Royal (Rana) Coup, reinstallation of the dissolved parliament and participation in elections, etc. The Great Debate, led by the CPC and the GPCR had enormous impact on the communist movement in Nepal. As the youth supported the CPC and Mao’s Thought, the old revisionist leadership, pushed their reactionary ideas using the cloak of Mao Thought. While they managed to confuse some cadres, other revolutionary youth of Jhapa, declared armed struggle based on the line of ""annihilation of class enemies"".

The biggest criticism of Marxism-Leninism from other tendencies is that the political philosophy is simply irrelevant now. So I'm wondering what appeals to you all about Marxism-Leninism

For a lot of people it seems that Marxism-Leninism is synonymous with Soviet hegemony. So many arguments aren't about the political philosophy itself, its economy, the personal lives of its leaders. But for me, and the reason I was drawn to it initially, Marxism-Leninism has always been the analytical methods of Marxism combined with the revolutionary strategies of Leninism, I simply see the early Soviet Union as the most correct application of these theories.

Furthermore, ""Well, too bad Trotsky wasn't in charge, now let's just pretend that Stalin incident never happened and go back to real Marxism.""

However

Another reason I'm drawn to Marxism-Leninism is, we have sites like MLM Mayhem, Espresso Stalinist, the APL blogs, and more. These people have their differences but most of what they say is usually dead-on. I want to be on their side when the revolution comes.

But it would be un-Marxist to blame everything on anonymous insults without trying to analyze WHY people resent Marxism-Leninism. I mean, that it really is outdated? Are we truly stuck in the 20th century? Are we just going to be sitting on the internet waging these historical arguments, or are we ever going to connect theory with practice? Can Marxism-Leninism be revitalized, or has capitalism changed so much that we're just going to continue to be pushed to the side?

Or has Revleft skewered my vision? I'm still hearing about organizations like the American Party of Labor

&gt; A World to Win was the unofficial journal of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM)

&gt; Until 1993, such as the PCP in Peru, it adopted Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Some parties, notably CPN(Masal) from Nepal, struggled against this line, which revealed some deep-seated differences. International organizations which adhere to ""Mao Tse-tung Thought"" can be found in ICMLPO and ICOR.

Of course this is not exactly a secret

&gt; Every thinking and honest worker and poor peasant, will admit, that we cannot immediately rid ourselves of the evil legacy of capitalism, and that we can liberate the Soviet Republic from the duty of paying an annual “tribute” of fifty million or one hundred million rubles (a tribute for our own-backwardness in organising country-wide accounting and control from below ) only by organising ourselves, by tightening up discipline in our own ranks, by purging our ranks of all those who are “preserving the legacy of capitalism”, who “follow the traditions of capitalism”, of idlers

(...)

&gt; The corrupting influence of high salaries—both upon the Soviet authorities (especially since the revolution occurred so rapidly that it was impossible to prevent a certain number of adventurers and rogues from getting into positions of authority, would not be averse to becoming “star” embezzlers of state funds) and upon the mass of the workers—is indisputable.

(...)

&gt; Another condition for raising the productivity of labour is, a fact which those who are blinded by bourgeois routine are unable to see; they are unable to understand what an urge towards enlightenment and initiative is now developing among the “lower ranks” of the people thanks to the Soviet form of organisation.

(...)

&gt; No profound and mighty popular movement has ever occurred in history without dirty scum rising to the top, without absurd muddle and fuss, without individual “leaders” trying to deal with twenty matters at once and not finishing any of them. Let the lap-dogs of bourgeois society, from Belorussov to Martov, squeal and yelp about every extra chip that is sent flying in cutting down the big, old wood. What else are lap-dogs for if not to yelp at the proletarian elephant? Let them yelp. We shall go our way and try as carefully and as patiently as possible to test and discover real organisers, people with sober and practical minds

(...)

&gt; The “administrative” elements provide a host of saboteurs and bribe-takers; the best part of the proletarian elements fight for discipline; but among both elements there are, bribery, personal gain obtained by spoiling the whole apparatus, upon the proper working of which the victory over famine and unemployment depends.

(...)

&gt; The fight against the bureaucratic distortion of the Soviet form of organisation is assured by the firmness of the connection between the Soviets and the “people”, the poor never regard the bourgeois parliament as “their” institution. But the Soviets are “theirs” and not alien institutions to the mass of workers and peasants.

1328891479.0,pjici,About Our Moderating Policy,,22,5,4,"Greetings r/communism subscribers and comrades. As new mods, the IRC channel, all intended to make this space something truly positive for the online communist community.

Towards that goal, and progressive. What are the main tasks of your moderators while carrying out this policy? First, to combat hostile sectarianism. Second, to combat reactionary and oppressive behavior. 

Too often, sometimes conversations about differing opinions devolve into name calling and irresponsible labeling. We as mods will step in to let users know when we feel the conversation is no longer positive or helpful and we would encourage you to do the same when you see it. Comrades, we dream of a world where Maoists and council communists, Trotskyists and Stalinists, can hold hands and sing songs of love and class warfare! Join us.

Another unfortunate feature of internet discussion forums is the prevalence of bigoted speech. The use of patriarchal, ableist, and white supremacist language is sometimes used with the full purpose of being hateful, but is, I feel, more often used innocently and with no intent to harm. Still, these elements, reinforce the worst aspects of the superstructure, so that they can explore marxism and what it means for them freely. As such we will also be reminding people not to engage in such negative

Repeated refusal to follow these guidelines, and we are no different. An official warning or reminder from a mod, or a few words advising that one is not striving in the manner set forth in this preliminary guideline from another user, should be looked at as a chance to reflect on what you have done wrong, self criticize so as to show others the proper way forward, and learn from it. Doing so will make us and our community a better place!

There  are also incorrect ways to react: to become belligerent, dishonesty over the criticism means that you cannot be trusted, and feeling shame means that you’ve misunderstood the reasons these guidelines exist and why you’ve been spoken to. The first may result in a ban at once, the second may result in a ban if you continue to behave incorrectly in the future, and the third simply means that something unfortunate has happened. We all make mistakes; the mistakes of the past, properly handled, should never be held against a person in the future.

Allende, Pinochet called for elections: vote “yes” to keep him in power, vote “no” to make him step down. “No” won, and 20 years of democratically elected “leftist” governments governed Chile until 2010. These governments were called “Concertación”, it was the group of left and center parties that won the “No” elections. The problem is that this coalition of “leftists” only perpetuated the neoliberal system created by Pinochet and did nothing to change it. In fact the Concertación keep privatizing resources and state-controlled means of productions…

In 2010 the right won the elections, leftists and innocents that gave their lives for the socialist movement during Allende. In these three years we have had protest after protest, we just haven't stopped protesting. But nothing has changed and nobody is hearing.

Now, 2. the previous president of Chile, a lady form the Concertación that calls her “left” but did nothing “leftist” (and the Communist Party of Chile is supporting her in a sort of leninist strategy); then some other people, and finally some guy that appears as a really interesting choice… his discourse is openly socialist and defiant of the current system, he is really close to the people and embodies most of the reforms that people is claiming. He makes his discourses in the streets and is currently supported by almost all the leftist students that is the majority of students). I and thousands of communist and socialist will support him.


So, tot he buses, to the metro, etc. And we are going to do some supporting this last dude I mentioned, but some others will be openly marxist. **I need some ideas…**

I want to make a sticker about the opening paragraph of the *Manifesto:*
&gt;A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar
I'm thinking of the government palace in the night with some sort of literal spectre over it


And also I like very much the closing paragraph of the *Manifesto:*
&gt; Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.
How can I represent this graphically?

Also, being them openly marxist or not.

&gt;Bourgeois government recognises the ""independence"" and occupation of Kosovo

&gt;The New Communist Party of Yugoslavia harshly condemns the bourgeois government of Serbia for the shameful reaching of agreement in Brussels with the representatives of marionette and puppet regime in Pristina. 

&gt;In this way the bourgeois pro-imperialist regime in Belgrade has recognised the ""independence"" of Kosovo and Metohija

&gt;The claims of the representatives of the pro-imperialist bourgeois regime in Belgrade that its propositions in the agreement will protect the interests of the Serbian and other non-albaniam peoples in Kosovo are meaningless and absurd. The creation of the so-called ""community of serbian municipalities"" will guarantee any freedoms and rights to the citizens living on this territory because it will be subordinated to the traitorous and puppet government in Pristina that follow unquestioningly all the orders from he western imperialist occupiers. The the Serbs in Kosovo will have the right to suggest names of the regional police commandants and in the north of the province the so-called Kosovar Army also is no guarantee for the Serbian people and other citizens who are completely at the mercy of the occupier and their servants.

&gt;NCPY declares the the current condition should be called by its real name, NCPY completely rejects the imperialist occupation of Kosovo and Metohija. The Albanian and Serbian people as well as all other peoples that live on this territory cannot be free as long as Kosovo is under the occupation of western imperialism and it's puppets in Pristina.  The Serbian and Albanian people should follow the shining example of the brotherhood and unity and revolt against the occupiers in the WWII provided by the Partizan heroes Boro and Ramiz. Only after the occupier troops of NATO leave the territory of Kosovo and Metohija can there be conditions for the free and happy life of all its citizens while remaining a part of Serbia. In the case that the bourgeois pro-imperialist Government of Serbia confirms the ""agreement"" from Brussels which stands in opposition to all the regulations of the Constitution that regime invokes, the NCPY holds that this will be a reason more for its immediate resignation.

&gt;Down with the anti-people Brussels agreement!

&gt;Stop the occupation of Kosovo and Metohija!

&gt;NATO get out of Serbia!
