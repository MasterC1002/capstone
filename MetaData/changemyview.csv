* Attractive people are viewed as less intelligent. There is an interesting study as well demonstrating an inverse relationship between the amount of skin shown and perceived intelligence.

But these issues are easily manageable, pre-established social connections and status, will initially command more respect, the *potential* for more exposure to culture and education and a significantly easier time achieving long term goals due to the aforementioned.

* Because I have an ethnic name, on the latter. I believe unattractive people face a similar problem of being able to get their foot through the door. Studies show that people will immediately notice the tallest person in a group, unless there is significant case of a person being short, e.g. dwarfism. Unattractive people are often overlooked, and people are less likely to remember them.
* Unattractive will have more issues regarding self-esteem. [The detriments of being complimented on physical appearance](http://www.nerve.com/scanner/2009/09/28/study-says-calling-women-pretty-makes-them-more-likely-to-reject-you) aside, consider the significance of scent to desirability, the use of wit and rhetoric - but these are things EVERYONE has to consider. Adhering to these rules does not give you an edge over anyone else observing them as well.
* People are nicer to attractive people, having attractive friends, like in one study where participants were asked to rate people based on their Facebook friends, also improves people's perception of you. So being attractive actually helps those around you.
* Unattractive people will always have to try harder

Just to counter a likely argument I'll hear, and is virtually permanent.

Secondly I should **clarify the argument to allow for more responses**: Yes I am stating facts, the term for a person who is poor and becomes wealthy is called a silver-tail; the issue with them is that they are never really ever accepted within their new community. This isn't a fact, this is one part of me that actually came to this conclusion without strong empirical evidence.

2. Culturally: This one is huge. Though people joke about this, teaching of evolution in schools etc. I think both sides would be happier.

That especially includes the notion of being a ""veteran""

Example: John Doe enlisted because he was physically qualified enough to join, but on those grounds alone, his status as a serviceman is not particularly heroic in my mind. This is especially true if he were to serve in a noncombatant or low-danger role. He's qualified and appreciates the compensation he's going to earn, which is not much different than the reasons most of us are in whatever career we chose. I would guess that there is a non-trivial amount of servicemen and -women who, for the most part, actually do view it as ""just a job"", possibly even some of those who are stationed in active combat zones. Could be totally wrong about that

Military service certainly poses a high chance of experiencing significant personal risk, I have more respect for and would be more ready to award the title of ""hero"" to the person who works in their local community to make things safer, or to help the poor, treat the ill, etc. 

I imagine some folks will lock onto that ""make things safer"" wording I just used, we have very often been the aggressors or are just protecting our commercial interests. I'm sure there are some counter-examples, but they seem like they would be in the minority during the last decade or so. I haven't done the research to objectively know the following, but I feel like most of the humanitarian efforts made by the US towards other countries are not done via military presence.

In the interest of full disclosure, instead of letting those young adults and that money be used to try to improve things within the US directly.

**Now, when it comes to using that particular word, I wish we would give respect and praise only where it has actually been earned by true valor.

So

When people get drunk, and it won't count afterwards. Therefore, if you give consent while drunk (I know consent is a complicated thing, but for the moment, let's assume it's perfectly defined, and consent was given), you can't take it back the next morning while sober. You are also responsible for any other decision you take while drunk (driving, for exemple).

Furthermore, that ultimately work against the real rape victims (and of course, the poor people that go to prison for nothing). 

More importantly, or with someone ""safe"" to back you up and make sure you don't take decisions you would not take sober.

EDIT 3: A quick list of argument I've heard (and i'm tired of answering to)

* Sex is like a contract. No it's not
* You can easily see when someone is drunk, this doesn't matter, as my opinion is you can give consent while drunk, which would make predation on drunk people legal, if assholish.
* The line from drunk to incapable of expressing non-consent is to difficult to determine -&gt; No it's not. If you can't physically say ""no"" or push away your partner
* Someone tried to argue that it was coercion to have sex with a drunk person ? -&gt; My definition of coercion must be different from theirs.
* If you lie to someone in order to sleep with them
* It's rape if the person knows they would not consent while they were sober -&gt; Except you can't know for sure someone wouldn't consent while sober
* You're a BAD VICTIM BLAMER, and I'm arguing there is no crime, and thus no victime, so I'm a BAD ~~VICTIM~~ ~~BLAMER~~, JERK at worst.

That said, so I apologize for any factual inaccuracies.

0) I don't understand all the praise it gets. I've known PhDs in English Literature herald it as a brilliant and sublime work of fiction

1) It's a children's/young adult book series. While in itself that doesn't make it bad, it's nothing special.

2) The struggle between good and evil is incredibly clear cut, attacked Malfoy, and broke all sorts of school rules. And yet, Voldemort is never given a sympathetic side. There's no motivation for him to do what he does, other than to be the big bad enemy. Somehow that clears everything Harry does of all moral wrongdoing. Why not make Voldemort even slightly sympathetic? 

3) On a related note, he causes a Dementor to get sic'd on Dudley, George looses an ear, Moody gets killed, on and on. Like I said before, never a second thought given to it, because it's good because he's the protagonist. 

4) The writing seems lazy. Really? Harry is the only one who can defeat Voldemort because he's the Chosen One? Oh, Fawkes the phoenix and the Sorting Hat, the bond between the wands. Not to mention the oft-argued point that his friends do everything for him. I actually disagree slightly, since he does manage some stuff on his own, but it's because of the plot last second miracles that he's able to. But still, especially in the first book, it's all just other people doing things for him.

5) This ties into 4), and she went the cliché way. Neville could have been the Chosen One, as much as I dislike that whole idea. He could've been the one all along that Voldemort was meant to kill or have some fate with, and *that's* why he couldn't kill Harry - it was the wrong baby. It was set up along the way, too, but then - BOOM! - mother's love. Or, at least, it wouldn't have been the biggest surprise ever

I know a lot of this is has probably been argued before, and never seen anything about why it's considered such a good series.

**tl;dr: Everyone was all in a tizzy about a children's book with no real moral conflict and a bad protagonist who relies on plot devices and lazy writing to save him from an interesting ending.**

However, traveling the world, etc.) because fundamentally I have never been meaningfully happy enough to make it worthwhile. To me sarcasm24 got it right with ""being dead would be just as meaningless, but would also avoid all the toil that goes into a life that is, ultimately, meaningless.""

I should start this off my saying that I lived in a town in which most (i'd say at least 90% of all students) went to college after high school

The dumbest of the dumb in my high school class, didn't do homework, would walk out of classes almost every day, and (I know one of them well as a family friend) got all C's and D's in their classes are now attending either the Community College in my area, or are attending low grade liberal arts colleges.

I believe that (setting aside athletics

*Nearly everyone* in my high school class went to college

To broaden my point even further, you'd be surprised how many of these there are) and they end up doing jobs in which a college education really isn't necessary. They end up working for small businesses. They end up starting small businesses. They end up starting in the lowest rung of a bank or company or even still interning out of college.

If we didn't instill a the idea that everyone should go to college in to everyone's heads, they just wanted to party) and could have started at these intro level positions right out of high school, or with some work experience under their belt. Which brings me to point 2...

**Point 2: The idea that everyone should go to college is preposterous and bad for society**

I know that, it was embarrassing, not only for you but for your family as well. And I don't think that this should be the case. I think that if you decide to go to trade school, or work a low level job full time out of high school, that should be *totally fine* and you should have nothing to worry about.

This is what ends up happening when you have people convinced that they have to go to college out of high school:

* Low level, and C average students from high school and charge them boat loads of money per year for a not-so-good education.

* Low level high school students flood in to wherever they can get in to.

* The job market gets flooded with people who have college degrees, many people aren't learning much at college) they have it on their resume and *make it impossible for anyone without a degree to get a job*.

* Students and their families are forced to take out students loans to pay their way through school

* The value of a college/university education gets diminished.

* And the only people who get a good deal out of this whole scenario are the low level institutions making bank off of insecure high school students and their families.

I really don't believe that a college should be allowed to exists if it has an above 50% acceptance rate. If you didn't try hard enough in school for your resume to have a better chance of getting you in to higher education than **the flipping of a coin** would

The only arguments I've heard against GMOs are ones of ignorance.

* People say we don't know how a gene will be expressed in a different organism. But we do. We know exactly how it will be expressed because all protein sequencing in eukaryotes works in the same way.

* GMOs give people the ability to grow massive amounts of food more efficiently than non-GMO crops.

* GMO crops are cheaper in the long run because you don't have to buy pesticides to have them flourish.

* Rice has been modified to provide vitamin A to people who are too poor to get enough normally. Other vitamins and amino acids could easily be added to crops to end nutrient deficiency across the world. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice)

* By putting antifreeze into potatoes you can get them to grow in places that they normally don't. Insert joke about Latvia finally having enough potatoes but to an extent it is true. [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9349256)

* Monsanto gives GMOs a bad name because of their business practices but the idea of GMOs is not dangerous.

* GMOs are tested by the FDA but I don't see these people lobbying against prescription medicines.

* An argument against GMOs is that we are ""playing God"". Besides the fact that this is a stupid argument that cannot be argued against because it is religious in nature

I have only heard arguments made by the group of protesters outside my local supermarket who want all GMOs banned so maybe I am only hearing ones that I don't agree with.

And, when added up, probably equal a fair amount of money. There's also the counterargument that models (say) are more insecure than more average people. But I consider ""I feel insecure"" (which we all do, every single one of us) to be a pretty damn poor excuse for being able to charm basically anyone.

* They are women in a society which is quickly changing to favor women -- Society today caters to women's needs. And, and so on. But more women graduate from college now than men, almost twice as many; girls do better in school than boys; scholarships exist for women to pursue male-heavy fields -- so in ten years I think the world will be much different.

- Checked the candidate's voting record on all the topics they care about?
- Studied the laws
- Has sufficient knowledge of the legal system, etc. to judge whether these laws, policies, taxes, or programs are good, bad, ineffective, etc.?
- Did research into his personal life to ensure that this person has some sort of moral compass and their ability to make decisions isn't being compromised by drugs, or something else?

Fantastic imagery for this struggle came out of the Occupy movement: 99% vs. 1% -- however in all actuality the ruling elite is more like 1/8th of 1% comprising of Hedge Fund Managers, broad economic factors

1. Education. The American education system is a factory; most specifically primary and secondary education (think Kindergaten through High School). A consistent theme can be seen throughout the style of ""Educating""  that creates a very transparent dichotomy between student and teacher. It is the teachers job to ""Fill the students with knowledge"" while the students must sit docile in the classroom and be filled like an empty container. This enforces the idea that the students don't know anything and aren't capable of any sort of educational discourse based off of their own experiences or critical observations and require someone (the teacher) to gift them with knowledge. Furthermore the education system isn't set up to teach critical thinking, language doesn't relate to social studies or math, etc... In essence High School is compartmentalized to be an efficient means to give students their standardized stamp of approval so that they may get a well paying job and bolster the workforce. Why is all of this problematic? It comes down this: The eduction system is created to domesticate the masses while squashing critical thinking and social awareness. Oh ya.. and how could I forget who lobbies for framing educational policies? The Corporate world whom have profited literally billions of dollars while effectively not teaching students anything (even within the paradigm of the education-factory system); see No Child Left Behind. The results are truly ""LOL"" worthy.

2. Economic Policies. This issue is massive so I'll focus specifically on taxation. Putting aside political ideologies of ""Big Government"" and ""Small Government"", not for the health of the people. I think that in this instance the healthcare system is a sufficient microcosm of what I'm trying to get at -- in general when there is a higher rate of taxation the people will rely less on the private sector and ergo give less money (remember: control and power) because the government is able to provide those necessities rather than making them commodities like they are now. When necessities like health care become a commodity that we can choose how well we our health is  protected by how much money we spend we've gone horribly wrong.

3. Energy. Ever heard of the Petrodollar? In 1975 Henry Kissenger went to Saudia Arabia and effectively made an agreement that OPEC will trade oil solely in the form of the USD. Who controls the USD? The Federal Reserve... oh ya.. those old guys are the people on top of the top of the 1%. This affects absolutely every aspect of our lives from public transportation to food production. I'd argue the reason why America doesn't have a strong public transportation system using high speed railways is that are incredibly efficient and safe and that they run off of (generally) electromagnetic and solar energy; not oil. This means less profit for the oil industry and ergo less power the the USD has -- in turn less power the elite of the elites would have.

All in all I think that regardless if you might disagree with a point or two that a class war is undeniable. The 1% don't care about the well being of the lower or even middle socio-economic class

tl;dr: The people who control money are seriously messed up and are waging a merciless and savage war on the people. Change my view.

Recently, there was a LGBT flag flown in a public park where several other kinds of flags are flown on a regular basis. Needless to say, there was a lot of uproar about this flag, and the newspaper quoted a disgruntled veteran as saying, *“I did not go overseas and fight for our country so that we could come back and be subject to something like that"".* [sic] Now, a Louisiana Republican is going to pass legislation to ban all non-government flags from flying there. *While the ban is not inherently anti-gay, the motives most certainly are*

But there are also veterans in the LGBT community, right here in Lafayette. If there is some kind of holy protection for the opinions and feelings for veterans, then why do we choose the straight, anti-gay veterans' feelings over the LGBT veterans?

I hold this view because I believe that weight and it's various consequences, I'd much rather be doing other less strenuous shit. But I still do it anyway because even though I'm not built like a brick shit-house (Australian for big and tough) I still find that it maintains the shape of my body. 

If I didn't work out then I would get fat or at least start looking pretty sloppy i.e. gut etc. But When that starts to happen I eat a little better and work-out and do my best to pull away from being fat or obese. If I didn't have showers twice a day I would stink. It sucks. People don't think I smell bad but it's because I put in the effort to shower when I wake up and before I go to sleep. If I didn't I would stink and people would react accordingly. If I stank enough to need 3 showers then I would do my best to do so. Even if there was a trend running in the wealthier parts of the world where more people were stinking

Please, do not do it. I get for a select few, weight must be impossible to lose. We are human, some people are born with hearts out of their fucking chest, I'm sure some people just literally can't lose weight. But I don't believe all the fat people here in Australia and America should even think about asking to not be teased or ridiculed. Obviously, I don't advocate street rallies against the fatties. I'm just saying that as far as people would normally ridicule stinky people or dirty people then so should that level of ridicule be due obese people. Some people stink more and so they have to shower more. Some people gain weight quicker or faster or easier and so they should be more healthy and work out harder to avoid being fat -- otherwise they are fair game. CMV.

- Often, whether or not this is true is irrelevant, this is not the government's decision to make. There should be safeguards in place so people can't walk out the door and take a cyanide pill, but if the patient is properly informed and is forced to consider his/her decision, then it's out of the government's hands.

- Some people ""choose"" to do it, assisted suicide might be chosen much more by poor people/people of color. I agree with this statement, but it doesn't change the sad truth of the situation. The alternative to not legalizing assisted suicide (which only costs $35-50 on average) is to legally mandate that these people do have to spend more money. Until our (the U.S.'s) health care system's high costs are somehow made affordable to everybody, this is the unfair reality of the situation, no different than the terminal illness that is ""forcing"" the patient to consider assisted suicide in the first place.

- It's legal in every state to refuse necessary treatment to sustain life and it's also legal to be prescribed painkillers for comfort's sake in this context. This rebuttal is a little personal, her disease being incurable at all stages. If she so chose, it would be illegal for her to end it now. To suggest that she could simply refuse all treatment to prolong her life and take painkillers/sedatives for comfort as a serious option to me shows a serious lack of empathy of her situation and many others'.

- Finally, so I did a little research. There is only one circumstance where euthanizing any person without his or her consent is legal is in the case of a child below the age of twelve, with the consent of his or her parents and all the expected conditions, terminal illness, extreme pain/discomfort, etc. Whether or not that is fair is irrelevant for this argument, I think; the point is that even the most liberal country in the world on this issue isn't going around deciding which elderly people to kill off, the mandatory euthanasia of adults is a non-issue.

Now my research started with anti-feminist areas of note, I felt this was important in order to successfully build up a counter argument. When researching an area it's generally a good idea to build up opposing points of view, which then you can bring in a discussion. After you bring these up hopefully they will be countered, and you can make an equal opinion. Sadly this never happened, and even the more moderate feminist websites and ideals are straying far from equality or even empowerment of women in general, hurting both men and those they claim to aid.

**1: There is no room for discourse.**

My main issue with this movement was the lack of space for discourse. I am a strong believer in the scientific method. You present your case

However, etc etc) is there a place for such important discussion. In fact this post was originally posted (and deleted from) /r/AskFeminists where supposedly all questions and view points are welcome) Rather than attempting to combat my arguments, much like North Korea and the creationism movement, they instead seemed to be more focused on silencing them. The learning experience I was hoping to gain never appeared. Even when searching online, I couldn't find a single feminist debate that didn't devolve into claims of sexism and other name calling.

**2: Their actions are hurting having actual meaningful talks about rape and other issues.**

Rape is a serious issue

This attempt to make every female a 'victim of rape' by including things 99% of rational people of both genders wouldn't considered to be 'wrong' also dilutes the meaning of rape in the public opinion, and 'fake rape' (Two people got drunk and had consensual sex, etc etc). Doing this is the equivalent of suggesting that all physical violence of any kind should be defined as 'Murder'. If you were to do that you'd also be diluting the stigma of Murder.

Also the male slut shaming and automatic presumption of guilt in most of their campaigns (""Teach men not to rape, or even ONLY men do it, but we're focusing on that part, honestly.' At which point I call bullshit. If I was to make a ad campaign for:

""Teach black people not to shove crack up their ass while robbing someone and eating fried chicken""

No matter how much I try to say 'Oh I'm not saying all or only black people are doing this

**3: The patriarchy might as well be replaced with 'Magic!'**

What most smart learned people seem to call 'Evolutionary affects on society' the feminist world seems to use this magical patriarchy that never seems to get explained. Sure they explain that it's a system where men have rigged all the systems because of privilege. But then seem to forget to explain where the hell this privilege came from? Did every man around the world all of a sudden at the same time just go 'I'm privileged!' (Without these individual cultures ever talking to one another?). And how the hell did this remain through periods of history where individual societies and cultures were being led by successful powerful strong Women (For instance Queen Mary -&gt; Queen Elizabeth in England). For such an idea to have any merit there'd need to be a 10

Of course, having one sex focus on physical power, and the other to focus on ensuring the survival of offspring, is a good way to ensure the spread of genetic material, a trait found through many many different animal species. And this genetic programming has naturally (And always will) affected our societies view on what exactly makes a good 'man' and 'woman', since several million years of evolution doesn't just go away because you have an Ipod, making both genders although equal human beings

**4: Extremely oppressive and offensive to women.**

Which leads me onto my next point. My mother is a brilliant person. She's a strong, and is something I will always look up to her for (I also look up to my father, but for different reasons). Yet somehow the current movement which claims to represent her suggests that because she chose to do what she loved, that she is somehow a worthless oppressed human. The message of feminism isn't even about breaking gender roles in that sense, as we can see a lack of fund-raisers to get more women into being dustbin men. No the message of feminism is you're only worth something as a women if you're a CEO, that screw what you want to do, you are only represented by the money that you make and anything else is simply you're too weak to stop being oppressed by a man.

And this is further exemplified by a lot of rhetoric provided by the main movements of feminism, or are self confident enough in who you are for it not to affect you? NO! Only a man can handle that kind of pressure and acting like an adult.

This is even further exemplified when these same movements attempt to suggest that women do no evil. No, When Female to male DV happens it's because the man did something wrong. The only reason that woman did that was because of ~~MAGIC~~ ~~Evil MENZ~~ Patriarchy. It's impossible for a woman to be Misandric because! Which all build a picture of females being less than men, when in reality females are also simply adult human beings, who have the same ability to do evil (And good) as men.

**5: Slows down progress and awareness by ignoring 50% of the issue.**

From what I can see the majority of the problems raised by feminism (Rape, society expecting you to do XYZ to be a 'real woman') aren't woman issues at all, but in general humanity issues that overall affect all humans equally. And these are big wide ranging issues that require aid. So to combat these issues, to take a strategy that automatically ignores and alienates 50% of the problem... seems moronically retarded.

Throw into this that the majority of these awareness campaigns are not only highly offensive to men, giving these monsters sympathy. Oh it's not their fault, their lives got ruined, it's because of the patriarchy. They didn't know it was rape because of the 'patriarchy'! They are the 'real' victims of the patriarchy! Although on an emotionally detached level, I do have to give kudos to the layer for being a smart ass and abusing the current damage these campaigns do.

**6: Wishy washy No stable focus**

And this is the real issue I have the majority of feminism. There's no actual real goals. This isn't a case of 'Make it legal for women to vote' any more

If I can hold myself to that standard, why does society not expect the same from women? *And are we even sure that this is an issue?* Has anyone done a survey of battered women, asking them whether or not they can deal with the presence of men in shelters? Has anyone researched whether female victims who have to cohabitate with male victims are harmed in any way by it?

Let me just define my meaning of 'scientific understanding'. The typical view of someone who uses scientific theory and experiment as a factual representation of the universe and reality. The person with dogmatic beliefe then

Looking at the following thought process:


    I subjectively observe a table. 
    I have a distorted 'picture' of that table in my mind
    Meaning
    has less information than the 'real' table
    So I then say that reality exists and I observe it with subjectivity 
    However
    I can then say that to me
    As I have no tangible link to it
    And the only reality I can verify exists
    ...is the local reality of my own experience


I believe you cannot objectify reality without assumptions. And the closest we can get to objectify reality is it's structure not the content. Therefore


These peoples 'Scientific understanding' then


*I believe a lot of people with 'scientific understanding' rely on a dogma just as much


Just for clarification

Edit: Note



___ 


***Update:***


Firstly I was overwhelmed at the comments; in how I could have portrayed my view better as some people misinterpreted me


Secondly, and people were able to get my meaning. My main point was that I find that science relies on a set of assumptions which a lot of people aren't aware of - or fully understanding of. [My thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/neurophilosophy/comments/1erbfj/cognitive_relativity/) goes into more detail on the view. But my view comes with a frustration of being poorly presented and the struggle can be seen today and in the linked thread. But there's a great deal of comments here that I can sieve through and either a) change my view b) better portray my view. So for that many thanks, I regret I have tested peoples patience enough, but I cannot commit to any comments changing my view yet. Please understand it will take some time to read through, today or another day - I will try to award a delta where appropriate. 


Opposing points:

&gt; My use of the word 'dogmatic/dogma' wasn't completely appropriate. 


* I wanted to illustrate that some people 'believe' in science with faith. Specifically


&gt; My use of the phrase 'scientific understanding' was slightly confusing.


* There are people who have a scientific understanding which I would (as per my view) categorize as proper scientific understanding like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hxgyq/i_believe_a_lot_of_people_with_scientific/cayzhj5) by user /u/rmill3r. As well as the type mentioned in the above bullet point. 





&gt; Scientific 'belief' is 'better' than the religious 'belief' 


* This was not an intended talking point - I just used it as a comparison that would catch the eye of science-minded people. Therefore I will not address which is 'better' because a) I can't fully represent a religious person as I am not b) the terms for 'better' are subjective and differ. However I do have somewhat of an opinion on this and I think for evolution and survival

This particular subset of individuals I have a hard time trusting, that gives me this viewpoint. The “homeless” population isn’t incredibly large, relatively speaking, with just above 2,600 people in the county who are considered homeless (I’m not sure how they are classified). Also, most of our panhandlers seem pretty well kept or at least they appear to be. But, even when I was in Sacramento recently on business I saw a couple cardboard signs begging for money

Don’t these people have any sort of family or friends to take them in? Maybe they don’t need anyone to take them in because they aren’t really homeless? And if they are homeless, or at least offering some sort of service they would be in a much better place. I struggling giving any sort of “donation” to someone I don’t think is trying to do anything to help themselves; worse yet will just take the money to be funneled into illicit activities.

1)	I assume panhandlers are just lazy people or addicts.

2)	They would just spend the money I give them on drugs/alcohol.

I acknowledge, undeserving of my consideration. Furthermore, I need to take into consideration the underlying circumstances, beyond an individual’s control, that might have led them to addiction and consorted effort it takes to get out that vicious cycle.

I still stand firm on the latter portion of my original post. I remain unconvinced giving money to a panhandler is the right way to resolve the issue. I feel this action has too much potential to perpetuate as well as prolong the individual’s circumstances. Although there are people who might use this money for good, I do feel it would be worthy of me to offer alternatives to money such as food or even volunteer hours to help those struggling in these conditions.]

Right-wing spend most of its time defending Silvio Berlusconi from trials and self perceived plots by justice, and Italy spent under a billion euros in fines because of that. In the early 00s he escaped jail by depenalizing his own crime.

In my view, or a career. As such, I think that the time allocated is a rather large factor: if you have more time to absorb or process the information, you may eventually get it. But the point is to distinguish between person A and person B for a position. 

Given an infinite amount of time

Now, I don't think its about measuring your best abilities when given infinite time. The rate at which a student can absorb and process the information should be compared. This is why I put quotations around """"best"" of their abilities"". Of course they could do better with more time, but so can everyone (a generalization, I know: I recognize that I cannot say that all can answer every question correctly in an exam). 

Now the reason I care is that the exams are graded on a curve. If you compensate for a student's difficulty in reading by providing them extra time to raise their grade

As well as this


Yes, or at least considered. No, I do not think that giving extra time in a standardized exam graded on a curve is the way to do so. I think it's like having a race between Pistorius and Bolt on the 100m, and giving Pistorius extra time. Then, taking that result into account as an average to determine who is the fastest runner. Again, I'm sorry for Pistorius to have a natural disadvantage (although I do not claim to be an expert in whether this provides disadvantages but I just compared best running times), but I don't think he should be given extra time due to his condition. 

TL;DR: I think extra time in an exam is like giving a legless man a head start in a race with Usain bolt until he almost beats him


PS: Let me know if my explanation isn't that good


Edit 1: Wow this has become bigger than I expected! Thanks so much for all the contributions: it's fascinating to read these comments. A common theme I'm seeing among the answers is now the disagreement on what exams test (which I should have clarified earlier): Some, and sarcasmandsocialism, seem to say that exams usually should not include how fast you can answer, or rather, as Sabazius said ""the quality being tested was a student's ability to perform in a given amount of time"". I actually do think so. In this case, as many explained better than me: the condition does affect a part of the aptitude being tested. So giving extra time does not level the playing field, but rather distorts results (which was what I tried to explain earlier). In this case

I campaign and support womens rights in prettymuch all endeavors

Because in our culture we've built such strong views about the female physique, should stifle change (this is, after all, natural evolution of society)...the problem with it, to me, is that we have such strong liability legislation and social statutes which create a disparity between how we're **told** we should now be treating breasts vs. how we **do** treat breasts.  For example;

As a male, etc...without repercussion.  A bouncer at a bar could hold me at a distance by placing his hand there, for instance.  A person at my workplace could move me to the side at the chest level, also.  

None of those actions would be deemed appropriate if I were a woman.  Yet the most common argument I hear for equal sex shirtless legislation is **men can do it, get over it**, said by people who try to dismiss breasts flippantly as if it's ""just another body part"".  Which it is, however, clearly people *dont* feel that it's just another everyday body part...because I could get in severe trouble for touching them, or even looking too long.

It just seems to be like an awful double-standard...and until the same people who say ""they're just breasts"" *actually* believe that statement

* ""Immigrants would take jobs that should go to natives."" Regardless of whether immigrants are taking jobs that would otherwise have gone to natives (the empirics I've seen lead me to believe that they don't), then they can agree to a mutually beneficial contract. This is uncontroversial (except among the far left), so what's different if the worker happens to live in another country?

* ""Immigrants would change our culture."" Immigrants have changed American culture in the past, no one would support deporting them.

* ""Immigrants would abuse the welfare state."" There are two answers to this. The first is that it would not be difficult to restrict the welfare state to citizens. The second addresses the purpose of the welfare state. If the purpose of redistribution is to benefit the unlucky (those who happen to be born into low-income families or lose their jobs through no fault of their own), and, in a utilitarian calculus, the benefits to these immigrants far outweigh the benefits of the welfare state to those who are already wealthy by global standards.

* ""Immigrants would increase crime."" I've not seen much empirical evidence to justify this claim. Yes, that is not an argument against immigration unless you also believe that native-born groups who are disproportionately likely to commit crimes should be deported as well.

* ""We live here, so why not change them? More fundamentally, though, why do you get to decide the rules? If I own a house and want to rent it out to an immigrant, under what authority can the government say that I can't? Does it own my house? If so, how did it come to own it? If I am a business owner and want to hire an immigrant, and the immigrant wants to work for me, it is a composite of a large number of properties with different owners, so why is it different for government?

I don't think that the original sexy image necessarily connotes negative things about women!

Human beings can process and recognize symbols in any given piece of media in millions, to be sure, but I don't think that it (i.e. one's cultural indoctrination) at all ""instructs"" the viewer to read the media a certain way. People have agency!

For most educated people, it is uncomfortable even to think about it, since the idea is immoral. For a scientist to make observations on this fact is for his career to be ended. All differences must be attributed to societal factors like discrimination and situational differences.

I invite you to CMV.,ComputerGeek01,228,63,271,"I've noticed that somewhere in the past five years there has been a focus on discouraging ""bullying"" at schools. Now when I say that they are discouraging ""bullies"" I don't mean that they are trying to prevent the straight up assault and battery that those of us who are a little bit older remember from our days at school

I'll start by saying I was bullied in school, that I was actually able to make friends with some of them. This has led me to believe that what is described today as ""bullying"" is in fact the natural behavior of a social species that is aimed at correcting the undesirable behavior in those around us. In case anyone is wondering I was the ""Know it all"" in class who would **constantly** raise my hand at every opportunity but then go off on tangents about topics completely unrelated to the class material just because that's what I wanted to talk about. I actually did a lot of things, but that's the one I look back at and cringe about the most.

If for example a person becomes obsessed with let's say a cartoon about colorful horses, with the people around them. If the school they go to then cracks down on his peers for their reaction thereby removing all negative consequences of his behavior then there will be no motivation for him to stop or change. Suppressing their reactions will not make this individual more likeable to his peers nor will it ""teach anybody about tolerance"". And actually punishing the group will turn their dislike of him into resentment. Now what about this individual? What is he going to do when he grows up and finds out that he doesn't know how to make friends or really communicate at all? 

This is just one scenario, kids with hygiene problems etc. You could sit back and say that those kids parents should be the ones who are addressing these problems and you might be right. But I say that there must be some reason that the issue isn't being corrected at home and shielding the ""victims"" from the ridicule of their peers removes and entire social correction mechanism. You could point out that bullying has caused kids to kill themselves, I would say that those kids probably had a preexisting condition such as depression that wasn't being addressed properly and sheltering them while they are a kid doesn't help them when they grow up not does it address their possible medical condition. I could go on but I'll wait to see if anyone actually disagrees with me.

I've been reading economics and business news/books fervently since 2008, beyond that almost nothing matters.

Take Hazlitt's argument that ""there is always work to be done."" This may be in fact true, but that doesn't mean there's always a paycheck to be had for that work. We know that argument to be patently false because we've all had to struggle finding a job. Just because work was available to be done did not mean I was going to get paid for it, you have to connect payee to payer. However, if you subscribe to Hazlitt's view, it's clear that anyone without a job is just to lazy to do work.

My basic argument is that plants and animals are not self-aware. They cannot have dreams and aspirations like we do, lets say a chicken, everything it needs to fulfill those requirements. However, chickens will never live long enough to actually change the world or become self-actualized, so what's the problem with slaughtering them earlier in life if it benefits humanity?

My friend says he wishes farmers would allow their chickens to live long, he's making five times less money, and will surely go out of business. If we enacted laws like this, thousands of people would lose their jobs because chicken farming would not be lucrative anymore. Is that really worth letting chickens walk around doing nothing for a little longer? This farmer could have had dreams and aspirations, and now he's broke and on the street because of so-called ""animal rights"".

My friend also says that anthropocentrism is bad for the environment, then would die from the floods and mudslides that would come because of the lack of roots absorbing the water from the dirt and holding the earth in place. A smart anthropocentrist would do his research and see that problem beforehand, then only cut down an acceptable number of trees and replant the ones he cut down so the environment sustains.

It just seems that some people think I can't possibly care about the environment if I put the needs of humans as my first priority. Saving the environment with selfish reasons is just as effective as any other method, in the past 50 years, the amount of smokers in Canada has drastically decreased, because of a 3-step thought process:

1. Smoking cigarettes can give you cancer.
2. Cancer is bad.
3. Therefore

It's only a slightly more complicated thought-process to reduce our carbon emissions for selfish reasons:

1. Carbon and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can trigger climate change.
2. Climate change can result in an increase in environmental disasters such as tsunamis and hurricanes.
3. Tsunamis and hurricanes are bad.
4. Therefore

So clearly, so it's only a matter of time before more people see the environment as an issue that really affects humans. We don't need to be ""biocentric"" to see that protecting the environment is an important issue. We're a selfish species, and that's okay.

- There are 105 men for every 100 women born. In the most active and productive years of their lives

- Women are given a substantial amount of attention in certain communities, gaming, science, or other male-dominated areas are special and desirable. I cannot think of equivalent communities where men are as ""in demand"" and desirable. 

- There are three times as many Male-to-Female trans operations than there are Female-to-Male [questionable statistic]. I see this as women being the more desirable gender.

- Women definitively represent sexually desire

- The image of a woman is more valuable than one of a man. For example

- The old saying ""women and children first"" reinforces the value of females over males. Society prefers that women live over men. We would rather send our men to war and have men do dangerous jobs.

- Female crime victims get more media attention than male ones. 

- Similarly, glass ceiling, etc. Male issues do not get this much attention.

- Simply that men are seen as the ""default"" human being implies that women are special.

- For a man to gain value

""A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, then a monarchy."" - Alexis de Tocqueville

Hi all

For for about 8 years now I've been growing more and more opposed to wealth redistribution and social welfare. I'm 26 and paying 37% income tax (second highest bracket in Australia - the next and final is $180, which is to say that more than half my income gets taken in direct taxation... yet I have no kids (not paying for schools), have private health insurance, etc etc - I'm sure you get the idea.

Now,000* would be paying $55500 total tax which goes to...

 - $19247.4 to social welfare.

 - $1221 to public housing.

 - $7050 to health (on top of their almost mandatory private health care).

 - $3244 for education (when they may or may not have kids, I am only showing Federal budget numbers here).

 - An additional 10% of every dollar which goes to the State governments

That money could be put in to a savings account and saved towards:

 a) Paying for future costs

 b) Paying for retirement.

 c) Generating wealth

I see a combination of a minimalistic government coupled with a user pays system of private service delivery as being a much more fair system. I'm curious to hear what you have to say about the merits of social welfare

1. Why a man.
2. Why being white.

~~I believe it is easier to be a man because:

* **Nobody is afraid of women.** If I go out late at night, who's going to change my tire? If I want to go travel extensively in a foreign country, especially the considered ""third world"" country, it's too dangerous. I am a woman, and I am American, and everyone knows how to to take advantage of that. 

* **If I sleep around, if I a woman knows that she won't be able to handle this baby, or if it was born out of rape, there are plenty of states where I wouldn't be able to abort it. If I even have sex with one person before they commit their entire being to me (aka: marriage), it's a risk. What if a mistake happens and I get pregnant?

* **Men have freedom of opportunity.** There are still many lucrative professions that are anti-women. Tech and Engineering are the most popular ones. I don't want to go in them, or if it really is an independent choice. Some people may say that if I really wanted to, I could still be go into tech or engineering, but there are extra difficulties involved that make one ask -- is it worth it?

* **Men aren't objectified.** If I go anywhere looking fashionable and attractive, that he won't, at least.) Even women see fashionable, tasteful women as bad for society; harlots.

* (This one is a bit humorous

**I now believe that men and women face different problems and that's okay. If you would still like to comment about this

I'm sure that there are other things

* **In Fortune 500 companies

* **There is still heavy racism against anyone who isn't white.** I know a lot of people say that there is racism if you're white, they still have an awkward wording and an unnatural tone of speech. When we go out, there are people who downright disrespect my mom because she is not white and she doesn't speak like she's white. There was racism in her workplace, at stores, at restaurants from the waiters/waitresses, and at job interviews. 

* **[There are too many Asians at top colleges.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/education/edlife/07asian.html?em&amp;ex=1168318800&amp;en=c1659d374db49dfa&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;_r=0)** We still don't know if there is a real bias against Asians at top colleges, but that was due to blatant racism against minorities. There were minorities who outperformed the white student, and the colleges rejected them because they were a minority. Now, we see too many minorities outranking white students, and they must be stopped!

* **Religious tolerance is insanely low.** I don't know if this really counts as a racial issue, regardless of whether or not you are Muslim. Even if you're Indian, which is far away from Iraq/Iran/Afghanistan, you will get picked on for being the evil Muslims who have invaded ""our country."" [Here's a really recent example. Sikhs are NOT Muslim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_shooting) Even if they were Muslim, that doesn't account for the racism that is experienced on a daily basis.

1373425540.0,1hzdr7,"Joyce's Ulysses is not a great book, and absolutely does not deserve the acclaim it has received. CMV",NoBromo1,167,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hzdr7/joyces_ulysses_is_not_a_great_book_and_absolutely/, but let's not take the debate there).  Perhaps, let alone a ""great"" book. 

There is a great deal of difficulty in trying to fairly gauge a work - there must be a distinction between Joyce, but the motives for its positive reception are somewhat of a mystery, so I suppose I have to equally address the fans in order to understand the positive feelings towards it. 

There is some good to be said about it. It has some worthy quotes

In the Ulysses Annotations by Gifford and Seidman, has 197 footnotes. One-hundred-ninety-seven footnotes. Provided you even use these, they do little to clarify whatever is currently happening in the text.  Even then, what on Earth is a book doing with this many annotations? I do enjoy relatively obscure references, but let's make a distinction between ""good"" pretentious and ""bad"" pretentious. I enjoy good pretentious, and by this I usually mean a handful of difficult references that complement or improve the narrative or theme. Bad pretentious is a sort of pseudo-intellectualism, which is more pretentiousness for the sake of being pretentious. A quote at the bottom illustrates my point better. Ulysses makes hundreds of references to things for the sake of referencing them

Here I'd like to address two things - a more subjective, and the admirers of it like to pretend they have a deeper understanding of it than others; one of the merits of the work is that it caters to a superiority complex. The work is ""comprehensible"", but only to a certain point - the admirers pretend it goes much further. I respect the use of steam of consciousness, but it was not enough to carry an entire novel, let alone chapter in the free-reign form Joyce gave it in Ulysses (vis-a-vis especially Portrait of an Artist, wherein it was much more effective and contained).   

It's necessary to admit to many of the difficulties of this sort of conversation. Appraising literature, literary appraisal is subjective. Why not just move on?"" The first point I would respond with is that I suppose that is just my personality - I have read hundreds of classics and studied many of them pretty thoroughly. Many of the works that have been called the greatest novels are typically worthy of this praise - The Brothers Karamazov, War and Peace, Moby Dick, although I think Dostoevsky wins out of these. Even the lesser notable contenders have some considerable merit to this claim. In Ulysses, however, I can find none of it. I would like to compare the work to many other modern artists, I'll see if anyone can reasonably explain the book's merit for a bit longer

Some final thoughts: This post absolutely does not do my criticism justice, as its length is intimidating for a Reddit post as-is. If requested, I will make citations to better illustrate my points.  Before these appear, I will end with addressing the obvious danger of citations. In a text this big, of course I and several comments will be making biased citations to prove our respective points; however, I do believe that my criticisms apply to the majority of the text, and will illustrate this point if wanted. 

I'll end with a quote from Nietzsche's Joyful Wisdom that summarizes my feelings well towards Ulysses.
""He who knows that he is profound strives for clearness; he who would like to appear profound to the multitude strives for obscurity. The multitude thinks everything profound of which it cannot see the bottom; it is so timid and goes so unwillingly into the water.""  173

Tl;dr Ulysses is not a great book. Joyce's style made for an interesting experiment


**Edit**: I removed a few antagonistic remarks to potential comments that seemed inappropriate. As I mention in a few places in the comments, again, I apologize for strains of left-over bitterness that can still be found in my original post. I am not too familiar with this subreddit and sincerely did not expect such fantastic responses. 

**Edit 2** Since there is so much to be said on the topic, and the remainder of the book would face similar criticisms.
On top of this

**Edit 3** Returning to this for the last time of the night, I feel like this would pretty much finalize me changing my mind (considerably, at least): If you can find one of the most ""difficult"" passages in the book (again, I'll try to find a good one tomorrow), one full of the things I've referred to in some comments - like obscure and seemingly unexplained references, lack of apparent chronological sentences (an example, this seems almost necessarily part of stream of consciousness writing), etc - and explain, but not quite problematic enough. I tried to emphasize words such as ""apparent"" and ""seemingly"" in this edit in order to illustrate that whatever passage comes up would pass under such criticism by myself,

User u/Bastrd_87 requested me to make some connections with what my view is with what my post addresses.

He said I should provide the reasons why I have the belief that flamboyant people aren't really gay

&gt;Homosexuals are people who feel sexual attraction for the same sex for yet to be known reasons (or no reason at all). This behavior gathered the hate of people in many cultures and led to the marginalization of gay folks on post-christian cultures. This led to extreme situations of social anxiety and other things, filthy disgusting business when they want to and they have been cashing in, turning homosexuality into a 'trend', like they could fix decades of blatant, explicit prejudice forcing a detrimental view of the gay culture down everyone's throat. This specially vomit-inducing here in Brazil, but I'll explain further if anyone want to. Now we have people who act gay to earn acceptance they can't through being ''''normal''''. This is pretty much like some fanbases that do more harm than good to something. Gay people are working hard to make an acceptable, stable and respectful image and people who are exploiting the stereotypical concept of gay culture are setting things back for them and should be reprehended. Now, but since people agreed that heterosexuals are the 'norm' or the 'basic everyday people'

That's why I believe flamboyant, oversexualized or promiscuous, deceitful, backstabbing and all that jazz) and should be reprehended and reeducated.

I grew up fairly religious and went to a private school for most of my young years (pre-school-7th grade). It was a lutheran school and I followed it but not very heavily because it was boring (of course). As I got into high school I started going to a youth group called Young Life which was really fun which made me associate fun with christianity. My parents never really pushed school on me because they told me it was evil and was just to brainwash children into becoming liberals. I realized this was insane after finishing high school

So here is my view

After realizing how damaging religion was to me personally both mentally, I have come to equate it as being damaging to everything. I see how religion has single handidly destroyed many countries and am seeing the effects it is having on America now (negative). I have yet to see any single benefit that religion gives to society and all I can see is harm.

1371870800.0,1gu53f,I believe the world -- in total -- would be a better place under a unified government. CMV,DaystarEld,154,37,161,"First

1 - I DON'T mean a unified culture that stamps out all the rich and unique diversity of humanity.  Each individual region should continue to have their own languages, art, festivals, etc.

2 - I DON'T mean one of the current countries that exists gets elevated to suddenly rule the world.  Rather it would be a multicultural organization where each region has representatives

3 - I DON'T mean that this unified body is a dictatorship with the ultimate authority to do whatever they want. There would have to be a system of checks and balances between the interests of the countries and the power of the unified government to ensure they only affect matters that are truly international

Now that that's out of the way

I think all military might and ultimate control of finite resources should be gathered under one banner and used to ensure peace and prosperity for all.  People who enlist in the military would be trained and dispersed around the world, sustainable goals, rather than what would be the most convenient or most profitable for one business/country or another.

In order to ensure that those in this United Earth Government do not have selfish reasons to seek power, nor would their children be able to inherit, nor their children's children, anything from the rest of their relatives... they would effectively cut themselves off from the rest of the world and ""start anew"" in terms of lineage.

So

First off, least bad) form of government is one where the members are elected by the populace, and that the role of society should be to protect and serve the many rather than the few, without discrimination for race, gender, sexuality, all that good stuff.

Secondly, with rampant nationalism that, world wars aside, came unbelievably close to bringing about nuclear winter once before and is likely to at some point in the future again (as the technology for nuclear weapons become harder and harder to restrict and contain).

Third, overfishing, and other adverse affects human short-sightedness has on sustainability, at some point or another I feel like the world's going to need to get its shit together and make hard decisions, as a whole, and that this will never happen as long as individual countries are unwilling to make sacrifices.

I've read a lot of science fiction, but I don't believe progress is made by ONLY striving for perfection, but both striving for perfection AND accepting half-measures and compromises along the way.

I know I'm not the only person who thinks themselves a citizen of the earth first and foremost.  Who cares about ALL humanity

Not that those who care more about their region don't have a place too.  Each region SHOULD have representatives that work for their own people's best interest, that their voices are heard.

I could go on for pages and pages of details on how I envision this working to maximize fairness and justice and minimize corruption and favoritism

Now then, the how this might occur isn't as important to me as whether or not it should in the first place.

**TL;DR**: I believe the future of the planet and humanity would be best served by a single governing body that has ultimate say over matters between countries or that affect the world as a whole

1368576019.0,1eclii,"I believe that, in the US, there is an ""education bubble"" that will burst within fifteen years, CMV",desantoos,24

Background:

I am a graduate student who could become a professor

Main reasoning:

Domestic applications have been declining over the past few years. I see this trend continuing

To offset this trend

1. China's One Child policy will leave a deficit of available young people in the upcoming years who could enroll in a university in the US.

2. The university programs in China are very likely to take off and be competitive with second-tier universities. [Note: I am defining ""second tier"" as schools with a USA Today rank of roughly 15-100] The investment China has put into research is particularly good and will likely allow them to gain ground on the US education system.

For these reasons, will be in sufficient financial trouble that they will have to fold.

Other reasons:

Research funding has dropped in the US over the past five years. Recent budget cut plans allow for a very reasonable argument that future funding will be slashed even further. Much of this funding goes straight to the university. Thus

Philanthropy is [barely up](http://chronicle.com/article/Charitable-Donations-Barely/132375/) despite a large economic recovery of the rich. It seems very unlikely that future philanthropy will overcome deficits

Salaries for university presidents are up 3% this year

Overall, and less success in the job market, there will be a continued decline in domestic enrollment. This decline cannot be adequately offset by international students: the demand will not be there in the future. Because of lowered enrollments and funding cuts from the government as well as no change in philanthropic aide, I believe that there will be an education bubble wherein many schools, including second-tier schools, will fold or cease to exist due to financial problems. Change my view.

UPDATE: Several people are bringing up the rise of India. It appears that I might be wrong on my perception of the rise of India... I will do some research on this subject before responding to that line of arguments.

However, news and culture from all parts of the globe are events in our daily lives. Moreover, with the space age came many iconic pictures like The Blue Marble, Earthrise and The Pale Blue Dot.

Removing ourselves from nationalistic perspectives can go a long way in reducing the desire or willingness for war. While nations may still be a political necessity [for the time being atleast - I hope at some point in the future that the planet can unite under an EarthGov - perhaps a stronger, more powerful successor to the UN or an interdependent coalition of continental governments], nationalism [and patriotism] are ,IMO, there is no reason why it has to be tied to the love a particular national unit as well.

Another example however; ""I think that you're fat, this is just an example) This is a feasible statement.  Offensive in today's times?  Of course, to the point that if uttered aloud the person could lose friends....ones who aren't fat. However, the statement on it's own is not untrue, it's a personal belief.

Another ""Black people in America disproportionately commit crimes."" This is actually a statistical fact, but unpleasant.

Hello everyone coming in from /r/bestof! [Thanks to this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1ikcbj/fedworkerthrowaway_describes_how_crushing_working/) we're getting a huge spike in activity.

Since there are a lot of new members coming in, and there is a lot of information about this subreddit that can be found there!

As some of you will notice

**DeltaBot may crash from having to award so many.** If your delta does NOT get counted

---  

While I have your attention, so to some it might make it seem like this subreddit's users all believe that.  

There are a few things I want to mention:  

1) **OP's view does not represent that of the community.** Controversial threads simply get more attention because people are passionate about their views towards them. About half the comments will support OP (especially if OP's views fall in line with mainstream Reddit)

2) **Is OP really being open-minded? Is this some kind of brigade?** We used to have an old rule called rule VIII that disallowed people to use this subreddit as a soapbox. Well, then **message the moderators.** Getting into needless slapfights only wastes your own time.  

3) **Why do we allow controversial opinions like XXXX?** You either allow them and take them on a case-by-case basis, even if they're not from OP. These threads are also the most popular by far (whether or not the activity is legitimate, ie. could be due to brigading, is up to debate but I believe it's legitimate) so taking away these discussions would hurt the subreddit. *I'm sorry if seeing these discussions puts you off!* Really, I'm not a big fan of them myself either. If you want to see posts that interest you, *try making one yourself!* Also, upvote and participate in threads that interest you! [Yesterday's Disney villian thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ihnzp/i_believe_maleficent_from_sleeping_beauty_is_the/) was an unexpected success

4) **So what kind of threads do we remove?** Obvious troll posts like ""I think the Holocaust was bad CMV."" which, or if OP is consistently rude to users in their own thread.  

5) **Think about what the alternative would be!** Controversial opinions that you might see on /r/askreddit's ~~weekly~~ daily thread may get posted here, CMV."" You can imagine what the responses would be like, right?  

I hope the above clarifies our position on these kinds of threads. I also hope people can point others to this thread when they are confused or frustrated by this sub's content.

Athletic programs sap resources from schools that could go towards improving education

Many college athletes who otherwise wouldn't have any hope of qualifying for a school get in because they're good at a game.  School acceptance should be an issue of academic merit.  The slot of an unqualified athlete would be better given to someone more deserving academically.

Athletes are generally held to lower standards or given leniency academically, and diluting the academic reputation of schools.  Everyone should be on an even playing field (huge pun).

I **do** think there is a place for athletics at schools, but I think programs should also have to be self-financing, which would mean huge cuts in expenditure for almost all programs.

CMV is the closest thing that Reddit has to a general discussion subreddit in which topics do not start with questions, I, but I doubt I am alone) often avoid posting potentially interesting discussions, not because of close-mindedness, but because discussing something can be more productive/fun than constantly being pressured to change a view. *This creates an opening for a new general discussion subreddit, which I believe could benefit this subreddit and its users.*

Please note that I am not arguing against the purpose of CMV here. It is one of the best subreddits currently on Reddit

---
**Further explanation:**
---
There is currently no discussion-based subreddit

**Problem #1:**

Because /r/changemyview is the only subreddit of its kind

*More popular:*

There are many more than these, they remain in opposition to the express purpose of the subreddit: 
&gt; CMV is not a place to preach to the masses.

&gt; We consider this to be an implicit rule of this subreddit. If you are specifically here to argue for a certain viewpoint and do not participate regularly in other threads

In short, and people are often reluctant to make that distinction. I believe that this is, in part, because *there is no other place on Reddit to post your viewpoint and inspire discussion.*

**Problem #2:** 

Because of Rule #1, in my experience, to consider OP's view and have their minds changed. They come to change OP's mind, and OP is often left stranded in a sea of hostiles (with occasional support from a few others). OPs don't get deltas, they don't get to change views, and there is an air of resentment if they do not change their own views. They spawn interesting discussion, but it is not discussion about their ideas. It is discussion about criticisms of their ideas--good for users as a whole, because the express point is to change OP's view

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1chlts/i_do_not_plan_on_voting_cmv/) is an example of what I'm talking about. It was my first post in this subreddit, not as a ChangeMyView, and it may have been better suited still to DiscussMyView or something. I have refrained from posting similar topics since--things that I think could lead to interesting discussion--because they do not fit in the scope of this subreddit. It's frustrating, though, because I see value in posting them, and in seeing others post that sort of thing, but, there is no active subreddit with that intent.

**Conclusion:**

/r/changemyview is the closest thing we have to a general-discussion subreddit. For many discussions, which are limited in scope and rarely offer a broad range of responses, since most people in those places hold the same sets of assumptions. This strikes me as a glaring hole in Reddit, and one that holds direct interest to users of /r/changemyview. 

I would love to see a subreddit where people made posts similar to those in /r/changemyview (thoughtful assertions of positions or presentations of ideas), thought-provoking things would come out of it despite that. Ideally it would be a cross between /r/depthhub and /r/changemyview.

---
**Possible solutions:**
---
1. Resurrect an existing, unfortunately, very, very dead.

2. Start a new subreddit (a few possibilities that I see: /r/challengemyview

3. Accept posts of that type into /r/changemyview.

4. Do nothing (perhaps because already existing subreddits are good enough

The third solution seems inadequate

The first and second are both interesting--the first could end up problematic because existing moderators could oppose or hinder this type of thing

---
**My questions for /r/changemyview:**
---
1. Do you agree with the limitations of /r/changemyview as I have stated them? Do you consider them to be good limitations?

2. Is there sufficient reason to start a new subreddit?

I am a classically educated pianist and I enjoy a large variety of music (classic rock, I cannot help but feel that rap and hip-hop are simply terrible in terms of musical quality.

I recognize that there are many songs in any genre that are unoriginal, repetitive, and of general low quality, vast majority of rap and hip-hop songs are qualitatively bad.

CMV.,Wulibo,146,43,316,"Utilitarianism is the belief that the most moral action is the one that maximizes total happiness for the collective. It believes that happiness for one person is equal to the same amount of happiness for another person

An example of this is that many people I know believe that once someone commits an indictable crime, to use Utilitarian terminology (or more plainly, they don't matter as much as contributing members of society). However, for a Utilitarian, it is just as important to minimize a criminal's suffering as it is to ensure the safety of society as a whole on the same scale.

I understand where people are coming from when they say that good people need to be treated better and protected because that incentivizes good, at face value, I think ""deserving"" is an invalid concept, and actions should be carried out to the maximum total benefit, rather than to shift benefit to those who should have it. I also see the entire purpose of law itself to be to steer society towards good, and therefore it is morally good to do things that will make people want to be on the right side of the law, but the end of benefiting good people more than bad is a means to the end of shifting those bad people to good more than it is an end in and of itself.

Not only do I believe that this is the *correct* moral philosophy, because a utilitarian world is better than a non-utilitarian one.

In a realistic, I won't do anything drastic, and I simply attempt to reciprocate kindness and consider that ""enough."" However, the core arche that lays in the centre of all of my thought is and always has been that my actions are ideally to the end of maximum happiness for the most involved parties. This does not mean I attempt to shift my thought patterns to that of an Archangel (R. M. Hare's concept of a being who knows every outcome of every action and can act to create maximum utility), but rather that when I try to ""do the right thing,"" or construct, ponder, it is always in the consideration of what will create the most total utility.

I've already read up on all the criticisms, the mona lisa is more valuable than the old lady in the fire, etc). What I ask is for you to show me ways that other systems of belief are not totally evil and in some way bigoted, in that they detract from total happiness to some personal or hopelessly selfless end.

For the first part of my view - I have very little faith that the Palestinian leadership is really looking out for its people and only looking out for its supporters which leaves a lot of people out of the loop. The PA as is jails atheists, people who sell land to jews, and people who work with the Israeli's. there is a significant amount of political violence and I don't see that ending seeing as most political parties contain armed wings. It will probably be a mess between religious peoples and people who want western economics so oppression of women and liberal thinkers will likely be policy.

As for the second part, and war with Israel, or at least regular attempted attacks either supported or unsupported by the state, are bound to happen. People like Khaled Mashaal don't go away just because they make peace.

1375725535.0,1jr4ub,I believe man and women can't be friends without sexual interest. CMV.,Jaricho,166,68,254,"I changed my view

I honestly believe this

Sexual interest is **NOT** Sexual action. 
Also

So here it is:

A man and a women. Can not be friends **unless.**

Atleast one of the 2 has sexual interest in the other. 

OR have been growing up pre-age 3. (Explained below) &lt; **Tiny edit** I learned this age can vary a lot. This was just the scientific study I have seen. ofcourse it can be 4 or 5

This even counts for gays

The pre-age 3 thing is pretty biological, touch and attraction of people around that age to protect from incest. Which as you all should now, is a bad thing for nature.

Try and change my view. I want to believe it

**Post-Edit 3** I learned about A-sexual people etc. but what I am interested in is actually: 2 average people, both heterosexual.

**Edit** Already thanks for all the responces

**Edit2** I have red a lot of important things

&gt;I think there's generally a lot of confusion with this issue because people don't really know what a ""friend"" is. A friend is someone who you go out of your way to spend time with because you enjoy their company. This seems pretty simple and straight forward

&gt;Just because I'm on friendly terms with my female co-workers

&gt;Also, unless I was doing them a favor or giving them a ride or something useful. I wouldn't just call them up to hang out. And the same goes for the wives and girlfriends of all my male friends.

&gt;Also, everyone is ""friends"" with everyone. It's just a mass of people, drinking, doing drugs and having sex. Of course all these people are going to seem like your friends. Just wait and see how many of these people you're anything more than facebook friends with by the time you're 30.

**Edit 2.1** (This is to get you up to date with my progress)

User irishninjachick is the first one to make a propper hit. and move me closer to CMV 

&gt;I saw an interesting question asked on /r/AskMen that was about male friends masturbating to their female friends. Many guys said how they would masturbate to anything and anyone that popped in their mind at the time. The person didn't need to be ""hot"" or even remotely attractive to them. I know both get curious what-ifs that aren't taken seriously. 

&gt;There's a difference between full on attraction forever and ever and the short-term attraction, a month, or a year. There's been times where I had periods of being attracted to some of my guyfriends who I originally had no attraction what-so-ever to because I was in a lonely phase or trying to grt over someone or just got very hormonal. It happens. But I wouldn't consider that type of attraction the glue of the friendship. 

&gt;Honestly, the sexual attraction isnt always such a huge factor for multi-gender friendships. For some, yes. Not all. 

&gt;There's other attracting features in friendships that keeps it lasting. Who says attraction must always be sexual? There are people who have very nice features that make you want to trust them more, but it is not the only one. People become friends for other reasons than sexual urges. Social psychology of friendship is much more complicated than you realize. I suggest doing some reading in it; you'll see how ""boys and girls cannot be friends without sexual attraction"" doesn't work.


Another responce from irishninjachick.

If that was the case, and loyalty we have for each other. That type of bound is genderless. I know if I need a good rant or some male in sight, I can count on them. I know if I need a night to relax and be myself, I can count on them. They know if they need a rant or advice, they can count on me. Ect ect ect.

It's the Harry Potter Marathons, the christmas parties, cheering for each other at events, walks by lakes, swinging on the swings, drunken nights at clubs and smoking hookah, midnight donut runs, freezing our butts off in the snow, discussions of plot twisters in tv shows, helping them walk when they are too drunk

That is not sexual attraction. It is a bond more powerful. Sexual attraction involves lust. There's no lust in those moments. It's like being in a family that you were born into. Think of your bestfriend

Both friends initiate contact. There isnt always a sexual attraction behind it. Sex might be one of the desires. Humans are social beings. We have a motivation for all types of companionship. For some people

A lot of my guyfriends have girlfriends. And you know what? Those girls know me and know I'm not a threat. Their boyfriends are dating them-not me- for a reason. A male is not attracted physically to every single woman on the planet. We all have our fetishes

For this reason, risky appeal is lost. If legalized, it should be regulated very toughly. Adults/parents should be well educated on the physical and psychological effects of the drug.

Clarification: After reading all these answers (sorry for the little delay)
What I meant is the WAY of finding ones opinion. Of couse you were right that everybody needs some axioms. It is the so called ""scientific method"", not even the most hardcore esoterics, and also no ""I play devils advocate"" intellectual called this methods e.g. a ""belief system"". The reason is: when you try to argue it, you automatically use it.
For the case of esoteric people, through hypothetical experiments (investigating shamans, information storage in water, chakras etc) until a point is reached where a conclusion can be made. When I tell them that e.g. in the case of homeopathy these experiments have already been made a thousand times, and homeopaths regularly fail controlled tests, then .. there is nothing happening. No further ongoing debate, no spark of thought, and came to a point where I question their usefulness.

There's no shortage of 'Obamacare' hatred online

Most of the hatred tends to be aimed at the fact that it's a left-leaning idea

I don't really see it about that

I know insurance premiums are going up

Is the idea of supporting a fellow man (with taxes) one which Americans really don't support?

But how good is this system? What kind of stuff do we learn out children? There are classes which could improve but are 100% necessary. Things like language, logic classes'' should be on par with language and math - as far as how much needed they actually are. 

But when we look things like history, or minimizing an factor could totally change people's views.  

I think we rely to much on the rinse &amp; repeat system. Which is outdated. The information presented in school is outdated. The books the children get are already a few years old

In this case that would be the *~~cancerous~~* ''publishing'' companies who benefit from this. They sell you a bundle for all your books which you need for that year. Lets say you have to pay 500. At the end of the year

An system based on software and interactive teaching will be more cost efficient

Now there are a lot of classes which are not getting taught at all. Things in life that you are gonna have to deal with every day in life. things like emotions
Basic psychology will improve not only your insight in these issues
One could also argue that understanding certain things like [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)
I think that the psychology and discussion/debate go hand in hand. 

I truly believe that if you want a better world you have to start by teaching *how* kids can think
Teach them logic

Whenever I'm reading through a thread linking to an article that depicts one sex in a negative light (rape, etc.), it seems inevitable that I come across some MRA/feminism discussion somewhere in the comments.  The first few times I saw this happening, I tried to follow the discussion for any compelling arguments, but it always somehow spiraled into absurdity.   I started skipping over most of those sections whenever I came across them, writing them off as a waste of time.

Until one day when I was reading one of these threads, the user's comment history had 80% of their comments in either /r/mensrights, /r/feminism, or /r/shitredditsays... (usually the former two subs, as SRS comments are always downvoted to the bottom of most threads).  


I've looked through several threads on both subreddits, intelligent conversations in those places are few and far in between... name-calling and berating seem to be commonplace, and this definitely spills out into the rest of reddit.  


Have I misinterpretted the point of these places?  I see them as a little destructive and somewhat counter-productive to their cause.  Some of these users seem like impressionable people who have spent so much time in these places that their views are completely shaped by them.  


As a disclaimer:  I'm not gonna pretend I know what it's like as a man in this day and age, and all-around terrible examples of both sexes and that these people do not represent either sex as a whole.  

I kind of see these subs the same way as I see /r/atheism now... they've lost sight of the big picture and have almost become parodies of the things they're supposed to be against.  Where hivemind mentality breeds and overrides any sort of outside influence.  And where there seems to be a common theme of users who tend to obsess over these issues above all else.

Tell me why these subreddits are more than just circlejerks for bitching about the opposite sex.  I'd like to know if there's some kind of positive influence that I'm missing.  And I'd like to know if I'm being narrow-minded for seeing those subreddits that way.  Maybe I'm just as judgemental as I'm accusing them of being?

I don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, hazards and dangers associated with them. I don't contest either, that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good, especially when used naively.

However, more specific, fertilizers become better to handle, cheaper and less energy-intensive to produce, GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past, that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.

And thus, using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as ""bad"" while labelling something that came out of a cow's arse as somehow magically ""good"", and instead have a sane cost/benefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.

The often trumpeted ""solution"" to this problem is a higher minimum wage. Something like double the current. The problem is that raising the minimum wage doesn't actually change the market pressures. If the market wage is below the minimum wage less people will be hired. To change the market wage either the supply or the demand would have to change. A minimum wage does neither.

Unemployment benefits on the other hand would lower the supply. People would now have a better option. A business couldn't have incredibly low wages because people would just stay with the unemployment benefits.

The fact that these are unemployment benefits vs just a check everyone gets is critical. The latter is close to our current system. People below a certain threshold, but it leads to things like the Walmart where much of the profit is in fact coming out of the taxpayers pockets.

Just to get this out of the way here's some common objections I've received and my response:

*  **Wouldn't this lead to freeloaders?**

   Yes, but not fun.

* **Isn't the government big enough already?**

  That's why I'm interested in what I might be missing here. My gut agrees with this

* **Scams/implementation?**

  This is probably the biggest problem I can come up with. What to do about the almost 50% of Americans who aren't officially employed? That would probably have to be something like benefits=unemployment benefits-income.

1374231651.0,1imhkx,I think that fiscal conservatism and libertarianism are morally unjustifiable. CMV.,Falsum2,116,39,241,"This view comes from the simple observation that, a janitor is unlikely to be able to afford health insurance

This problem can be avoided through the provision of tax-funded government services such as public health care, that people who do certain jobs deserve to suffer for it. To my mind, any moral justification of conservatism needs to provide a defense of this point. Since this point is indefensible, the moral case for conservatism falls.

The first reply to this that I might anticipate is that nobody forced the janitor to be a janitor. If she wants to improve her circumstances, start a business, or otherwise work to improve her circumstances. This seems naive to me. If all the janitors did this, then who would clean the floors? We need janitors, and if they all decide to get bootstrappy and improve their circumstances, then we will have lost an important service. Why do the people who provide this service deserve to live in worse conditions than people who provide other services?

The second possible reply has to do with the ultimate impact of deregulation and the elimination of taxation. An unregulated economy, and pure libertarianism is a completely untested economic system. My second response is that even if this argument is correct, and conservative policies will eventually create a rising tide that lifts all boats, this still ignores the situation of the working class *today*, who would be effectively sacrificed in order to obtain these future benefits. This is not an ethical trade-off in my view.

Lastly is the moral argument that taxation is theft-an absolute moral wrong that should be eliminated or minimized regardless of what benefit it might bring. I think this argument fails to notice the social construction of wealth: infrastructure, policing, national security, environmental protections, health care, and market policy are all part of a system we have created to facilitate the generation of wealth. Wealth is therefore socially created. In most countries, we have decided, that it makes sense to award a greater share of the wealth generated by our system to those who have the skills and initiative to create and improve products and services-the CEOs, then we have that moral right. If you don't buy that argument

What I'm arguing is that this is wrong to force this onto other people.

1. This is an unhealthy burden to put on the young people of the world. Respect usually signifies a higher intelligence

2. Believing respect is given can give out the opposite effect. If the ""respected"" is actually a cruel person(s) then why do the respectees need to respect this person? Rebellion begins

3. Why do we even believe in this credo in the first place? At what point did we think that we could just go about our will and expect those who we percieve as ""below us"" to respect us? I believe this develops unhealthy relationships between people and only causes problems.

Rape is non-consensual sex.  Of course there is definitely room to debate whether something is sex or not (does being fingered count as sex?  And there is certainly room to debate what exactly qualifies as non-consensual.

But there is no question as to whether penis-in-vagina penetration is sex; everyone agrees that is sex.  And no question about whether there is consent - everyone agrees that being physically forced into sex is non-consensual.

The main counter argument is that if true Laissez-Faire Capitalism was implemented tomorrow in the United States that 2 or 3 Multi-Nat Corporations would take over everything and we would all burn to the ground under or corporate masters boots. I think this is complete and utter bullshit. The only way (and history is as far as I know completely on my side) a monopoly can form is if the government intervenes and creates corporatist legislation. 

This is a compounding issue. If the government has the ability to create sweeping legislation for corporations and business

If you can name a **SINGLE** natural monopoly that has ever formed (read: one without government protectionism or corporatist legislation of any kind) I will completely concede this argument and in fact will likely change my entire perspective on economics as a whole.

The ONLY way a natural monopoly could ever form is if a business undercut the rest of their competition so much that their products became affordable to everyone while at the same time developing such a technological advantage in both R&amp;D and production that the quality and quantity of their goods did not decrease because of their massive cut costs to consumers and had such a massively successful infrastructure and costumer support wing that consumer approval of their company would be at near 100%

And I have to say

Monopolies exist in their current form because of corporatist legislation like Limited Liability and Indefinite Duration and the governments obsession of perpetrating things like the Stock Market. They would not exist in a vacuum. They **can not** exist in a vacuum. We need a fair economy. The solution is creating an even playing field for everyone and creating a situation where small business can flourish. 

This also means creating a system where small business can (figuratively) be shut down if they overstep their natural boundaries. The best way to do that is without any legislation at all

I think the only reason people are terrified is because they see graphs like [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Population_curve.svg/350px-Population_curve.svg.png&amp;imgrefurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population&amp;h=207&amp;w=350&amp;sz=6&amp;tbnid=wZ7rAqJKGO-ROM:&amp;tbnh=71&amp;tbnw=120&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__Fia9hekf37zUUn9YszWApu5b_oY=&amp;docid=Rfq_Aji5yK4L7M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5e7lUdb2CcTuyAGM5YHQCg&amp;ved=0CDQQ9QEwAg&amp;dur=397) and think ""Oh no! Look how much our population has increased in an incredibly short span of time! How will we survive?"" The problem is that,000 B.C. to 1 A.D. and see essentially the same type of graph, just with a smaller total population.

Finally, which can hardly support us."" Thomas Malthus thought that the food supply would grow at a stable rate. We see now that he was wrong. Food supply has grown along with demand due to new technologies he could not foresee. Paul Ehrlich wrote in 1968 that millions would die in the next decade. It never came to be. To be fair, others have criticized Malthus, Ehrlich, and others, but that is exactly my point. No one can seem to agree on the amount of the carrying capacity. Estimates range from under a billion (which can now obviously be discredited) to over a trillion. UN estimates range from 7.8 billion on the low end to 12.5 billion on the high end. And this is all assuming no more technological advancements are made. I'm not saying that we should automatically hand-wave any estimate of the carrying capacity. All I'm saying is that there are too many variables to calculate to get an accurate answer. We could easily meet our carrying capacity in the next 50 years, or be just fine for the next 1

Now to the practical and moral aspect. By definition, the policy only seems to have affected China's sex balance. Their population is still growing due to the underlying fact that it's incredibly difficult to enforce something like this. In recent years, China seems to have grown more relaxed about the policy. We could educate people about family planning, but this only addresses a symptom rather than a root cause. Ultimately, if a family wants to have six kids, nobody is going to (or can(or, in my opinion, no real solutions have been offered. We hear cries of ""We HAVE to control our population or we will meet dire consequences!"" Yet no solution is ever offered as to how we would achieve such a goal. My opinion is because the only ""solutions"" offered are considered immoral by most people (one-child policy) or impractical (education.) They simply save face in the public eye by crying about how overpopulation is bad, or genocide. These are the only ""real"" solutions to ""overpopulation"" and they are both immoral and impractical.

In my opinion, we should be focusing on providing for those who can't survive regardless of the amount of people there are. That's the true tragedy here. Western governments moan about the fact that eventually there will be too many people to support their citizen's lifestyles, yet ignore the fact that there are already countries who don't have enough, despite the fact that are currently enough resources to support our planet.",,False,,False,t3_1igjwd

I honestly would like someone to change my view in regard to this because I totally believe that the academic elitist view of many engineers (myself included) is justified based on the difficulty of my classes. I haven't heard much of the same from other STEM majors but I think at this point it's a justified view for them as well. 

Basically, philosophy), it is my opinion that non-STEM majors (excluding skill-based arts/music) are much easier and in general require less work to get the same grade. If I were to decide to major in a non-STEM major I think I could be just as if not more successful than nearly everyone in these majors if I wanted to pursue one of them instead. I do not think the same can be said of a non-STEM major switching into engineering. They may be able to make it through the introductory courses but upper level undergraduate sequences of classes like heat and mass balances --&gt; fluid transport --&gt; heat and mass transfer I think would prove nearly impossible for the majority.

**Thus, I would very much appreciate it. I will do my best to reply to all reasonable challenges. Please feel free to ask me for any clarification.

Edit: I do not believe that I am more intelligent or that STEM majors are inherently more intelligent that people in other fields. Many of you have made my conscious of the fact that what I believe stems more from the fact that the mid-level university I attend does not seem to have as strict of requirements for non-STEM majors in regard to coursework as it does for STEM majors. I'm certain there are programs out there with excellent non-STEM programs that I would be in way over my head at.

Further edits may be required to better clarify my opinion on other matters.

**The Purpose of Exams**: In my mind the purpose of examinations is to rank  people in order of ability. Assuming that performing well under pressure (which is imposed by including a time-limit) is an ability then to allow some people a longer time under these conditions allows for discrepancies in the results i.e. people that got better marks may not actually be better at the task. If the test is not meant to value this ability, even if it is in excess of what is normally needed to finish the exam.

Some people have challenged this purpose of exams so I would like to draw a brief clarification that I am not talking about classroom tests and what not but things that effect career opportunities and getting into universities. In England this consists of A-levels and GCSEs but I am confident there is a cross-Atlantic equivalent.

**On Mental Disability**: For an example I shall use Dyslexia as I did in the title. Dyslexia is a mental disorder that is characterized by difficulty reading

**Time-Limits**: Time-Limits for exams exist for practical purposes

I also have said numerous times in comments that I would give everyone the same amount of time the Dyslexic people currently (but only for exams that are not testing speed) making sure everyone has enough time to finish the exam.

**Physical Disabilities**: Are not relevant and analogies have repeatedly proved to be ineffective. My refutation of these analogies typically boils down to the fact that a mental disability is permanent while a physical difficulty can be accommodated for in the work place (such as glasses or a text to speak computer program).",,t5_2w2s8,1367799035.0,,points ,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dq5nl/i_dont_believe_people_with_mental_disabilities_eg/

Even emergency services (like me when I'm on duty as an EMT) can be recognized as non-civilians while on duty.

When I have been a victim of crimes or when I've had family members be victims the police have either been entirely unhelpful or made the situation worse for the victim.

I no longer report crimes to the police unless I have insurance reasons for doing so

**Property Crimes**

This is my biggest complaint, and was seen by another roommate exiting the front door as she left.  When the vandalism was discovered we called the police, they came, were told the story, spoke to the person who saw the guilty party leaving, and received a current address for the vandal's whereabouts.  Later the guilty party posted on facebook that her roommate said the police were looking for her-- she thought it was hilarious.  We followed up with the police, as did our landlord (most of the damage was to the room itself)

This is the most egregious experience I've had, but nothing was done.  The people who broke into her card attempted to use her ATM card to pay ""Graduation Fees"" at a local high school-- my mom attempted to get the police to investigate further but they were unwilling to do so.

So unless I need to deal with an insurance company why the hell would I go to the police if someone steals or damages my property?

**Sexual Crimes**

I have a family member who was sexually assaulted.  Not a 'stranger in an ally situation', or apprehending an offender, but instead trying to create doubt that a crime had occurred.  In the end they did nothing other than compound the trauma of the rape.  The victim regrets having gone to the police.  I entirely believe her story on the basis of long observation of her personal stability and the clear effect this had on her in the aftermath; please don't try and tell me that if it really was as she represented the police would have done more.

**Violent Crimes**

I have never been a victim of a serious assault or attempted murder and the only people I know who have are the kind who 'don't snitch' no matter what happened.  So I admit a lack of direct experience here and expect police take such things somewhat more seriously.  Still

***A tax exemption is a privilege


***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***


***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***


***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): ""Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.""
The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup ""faiths, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that ""exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations"" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend ""seminars."" The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a ""thriving cult of greed and power"" and ""a hugely profitable global racket,"" was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this ""saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes.""


***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.


***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a ""megachurch"" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.


***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, a Christian legal group, organizes ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday,"" encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the ""liberal media"" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: ""I'm going to explain to you what happened… Nothing happened.""


***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton


***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates.*** As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place.""

If we require licenses for things such as driving a vehicle or being a practicing doctor

I don't believe reproduction/conception is a miracle. If anything
Birth is no miracle. Birth is the most common behavior amongst all living things. 

We live in a world where we put laws and regulations on every day life. So if a life of a human being is SO important

Many are unwanted. Many cannot be raised in the social-economic status they were born in. Many are mistreated
So why are we letting new life be born into a world that will not be adequate for them?

If the government is going to put a restriction on what plants I can or cannot set on fire, I think they have all the right to put a regulation on whether or not I'm fit to have a child that will grow with adequate resources and shelter, good education, morals, love, etc.


If licenses were required

EDIT: Consequences would be to terminate the life of the baby either during pregnancy (if detected during) or right at birth. Maybe the age cap would be 1 or 2 years old in the case of a hiding mother. This procedure could be law in hospitals.

The fog fooled you, and in the distance the indistinct shape that caused your heart to flutter looked real enough, cold and rough and lifeless.  Oh well.

The stone always *had* stone-like features, of course, but those were never the source of your attraction.  You were attracted to the statue insofar as it resembled a woman, and no further.

I would argue the same is true of the tricks people use to prove the point I'm posting this CMV about.   When people post a picture of an armpit (reddit reference alert!) that looks like a vagina, but fooling someone in this way does not prove they are attracted to men, if the source of their attraction was the apparent female traits.

I think of it like this: In a free marketplace, they just have a standard minimum rate at which they pay their employees. For an individual firm, this is not a problem. However, the current marketplace we're talking about has multiple firms, and all those firms pay the same starting wage. The result of this is a monopoly-like scenario in which competition is virtually impossible because all employers have a guaranteed peg point at which they can assign wages, that all unskilled workers will have to accept because of the existence of a ""minimum wage"" law. In the long run, the inability of the legislature to update the minimum wage to keep pace with changes in the consumer price index makes the wages of unskilled laborers stagnate. This is great for employers, and employees are virtually guaranteed to accept those wages solely because of the existence of a ""minimum"" that they believe is all that they are entitled to in a starting position. 

I believe that an unrestricted wage system would be better, the removal of this peg point would place upward pressure on wages until they reached a point that both employers and employees were willing to accept.

That is, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. She would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, and do girl things.

Here is where I have the problem. What are ""Girl traits""? What are ""Girl things""? 

I have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. I dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, and as such, **I don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. And I think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are.

When did we decide what traits are? What is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? Or a boy for that matter? What, there's ALL SORTS of things that I do that other people would consider ""Girly"". But the thing is, I think people are full of bullshit. I mean, I don't really *care*. If people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, I would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. 

It's just, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. It seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. Like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? All you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. All wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. That's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*.

I couldn't respond immediately at the time, it also hits home because I was unplanned and our family doctor had recommended to my mother that I be terminated. But here I am, and it's hard not to feel grateful for the decision my mother made. It's easy to simply say, 'I am a complete person, but so is my mother, and she was here first. Her womb, her rules.' and leave it there, knowing that somewhere

**So what if my mother had aborted me?**

* **To see this as an unethical or immoral course of action, you'd also be forced to consider the variables which nullify that potential. As the title states, I don't believe you can harm someone by failing to cause them exist. My parents were refugees from the Vietnam war, and had fled to Australia where I was conceived and born ten years later. It would be asinine of me to say had conscientious objectors and war protestors had their way, I would not be born - while technically true, no logical person makes decisions in respect to infinite possibilities, which is where we all sprung from. To inverse the logic, who would know what to blame?
* **There is no psychological continuity between myself and the fetus, I wasn't congealed in a gutter. The person I am now, and the person I could be in five minutes from now, or a year or ten years, will be the same person because we will share a stream of consciousness. Because the fetus does not have the capacity for this complex cognitive process, had I been terminated in womb, I don't believe any connection would have been severed. In a sense, so I don't believe you can be angry or sad for not existing.
* **I believe that if the choice the mother makes determines whether or not you exist**. Had I been aborted, is often a difficult one). I believe person-hood is granted when the mother decides you can exist, this sounds impersonal on some level, but it's the same reason an aborted fetus is not given a funeral but a miscarriage often is. I suppose this is contentious, because pro-life advocates consider the fetus, even at its earliest stages, to be alive; however, you're only a concept.

So those are the crux of my arguments, please feel free to.

**NOTICE**: I'm back now, so I'll provide macro response in the OP when I can. Just to clarify first before I delve into the comments - up until at least 7 weeks the embryo doesn't have a head, and depending on who you ask, the organism inside the fetus isn't self-functioning until about 19-24 weeks; while I understand people view the organism as life from conception an on onwards, or don't make a distinction between that bundle of nerves and self-functioning organism, it's a bit difficult to respond to you while you hold that view. That's not your fault of course, and I will certainly try to respond

Also

----
I'm adding this

Personally I disagree with the pro-life advocates mainly because it has a higher regard for the vague and uncertain notion of the unborn child, they argue that 'all life is precious' and it is worth protecting at all cost, because there is no difference between the unborn child and a newborn. But life is a miracle, because we are here, in spite of the impossibility of a universe which has pitiless indifference towards our well-being, not because we *can* exist. Those who are here, have far more precedence than those who could be.

I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now.  New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus

Some communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities.  I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service.  The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity.

They use a commodity standard so that money approximately matches resources, one guy comes along who is good with the free market and very committed, hard working, etc.  He loves nothing more than to own more money and resources, a money hoarder.

He piles up 10% of the money on the island before anyone notices through diligent saving (or hoarding, so the price of everything falls by 10%.  Nobody cares because all prices fell together.

**On the licence:**

People need to apply for a licence to drive a car, to fish in a river, to cut down a tree, to come live in a country. Now I understand the need to regulate behavior that can impact other people's lives, so I think we should definitely regulate the behavior that can impact most strongly someone else's life: parenthood. The parent is commonly the most infulential factor for a child's world, but independent of mental &amp; social fitness and the ability to economically sustain a child anyone can have as many kids as they like.

I'm seeing a lot of disagreement about exactly how much stress is put on our planet by the massive population, since there is no definite scientific consensus (just like with global warming), there is no definite answer. My attitude is to be on the safe side and aim for a modest unimposing humanity on the long term, while some of you seem to want to take the jolly ride and see where it ends. This makes me very sad.

To keep this discussion centered, the parties to a transaction determine the prices at which assets, goods, and services are exchanged.

I want to define quickly what I **don't** consider to be capitalism and which I am *not* arguing in favor of: Crony capitalism: A description of capitalist society as being based on the close relationships between businessmen and the state. Instead of success being determined by a free market and the rule of law


Three key features of capitalism:
 
**Effeciency** 

- Efficient allocation of resources: In a market system

- Efficient production: In a market system
	
- Dynamic Efficiency: This is efficiency over time. Firms in a capitalist system need to respond to changes in consumer preferences and respond to new consumer trends.
	

**Incentives**

- Evidence suggests that people work hardest when there is a personal financial incentive. E.g. entrepreneurs only take risks in setting up businesses because of the potential for large financial reward. If this scope for private profit is absent then new firms won’t be set up.
	
**Competition**

- A market system helps produce products most in tune with consumer's needs and equalize prices because a business will go of business if it does not create products that consumers want and at prices they are willing to pay.

http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1259/economics/advantages-of-capitalism/


Here are some of my rebuttals to arguments that are likely to be raised:
	

* **Capitalism does not lead to greed.** Greed is a product of human nature, communist, or some combination thereof, will manifest greed amongst some people.

* **Capitalism is not a zero-sum game.** For someone to win

	
* **When exchange takes place in a free market, but at the time of the trade both parties valued what they got more than what they gave, otherwise they would not have traded. It is easy to see how value is created on both sides (because economic value is subjective), and how there was no ""loser."" Beyond this simple illustration, over the long run the wealth generation of capitalist trade grows the overall pool of valuable resources and increases choice for all involved. This means the potential for more and bigger ""wins"" as time goes on and specialization and trade increase. Wealth is created, not distributed.
* **Capitalism is not for the rich.** If there's any class or group that benefits more from capitalism than any other, rich and poor alike, play the part of the consumer at various times. But it is an inescapable fact that in order to succeed in a market, you must create value for consumers. Ludwig von Mises sums this up nicely: ""The riches of the rich are not the cause of the poverty of anybody; the process that makes some people rich is, on the contrary, the corollary of the process that improves many peoples want satisfaction. The entrepreneurs, the capitalists and the technologists prosper as far as they succeed in best supplying the consumers."" The rich do not live at the expense of the poor, they often lead to direct benefits for the poor over time by way of lower prices and access to new technologies. Even the most selfish, cars, ad nauseam. If there were no wealthy customers around to purchase these impractical items

Channels like Vsauce, sxephil, zefrank, smartereveryday and others put so much more effort in their content but have only a fraction of the subscribers. Granted, the audiences of these channels is a lot stronger and more enriched. When you walk away from those channels' content, you always take something away, whether it be new knowledge, a new view about something, but there are so many other better sources for that. 

New users of Youtube are likely to see these top creators first, *anything* to get new, fresh creators in the spotlight. Top users don't need the exposure anymore. They have anywhere between 5 and 10 million subscribers. Their video views alone generate millions of views by default just from the shear volume of followers. The stats show they rake in 10,000 to 50,000 new subs a day, and 50,000 to 100, a lot of VEVO channels dominate the top of the list and should naturally be exempt from the charts due to the nature of the content. 

I'm really questioning *why* the top content has made it to the top. Compared to other things, and doing it a lot better. Some may say that it's just my opinion, but I'm really starting to think that maybe it's not. There has to be some reason for why things are panning out the way they are, because it just doesn't look right.  The quality is literally nonexistent now. 

I'm beginning to think that top creators are either:

1)  generating so much revenue that Google/Youtube is intentionally making it easier for them to stay successful in order to keep money rolling in due to influence... 

2) or these creators' success was a total fluke, which means the content never evolved from hard work and was stunted in sort of a rough, unrefined, infant stage. New users joined the site looking for this content and saw this unrefined garbage on top, and thought ""well it's the most popular so it must be the best right now"", which only further helped the success snowball. 

Either way, and with so much money involved/invested in this weak content, it only further encourages it, and change seems impossible. The structure of the website atm lets the big get bigger, and the small to wither away. True high effort content and creativity is being suffocated and smothered out. Because of this, these users are at the risk of ceasing what they're doing completely, or changing things up in order to imitate what the big names are doing.

I think my view is now a lot more open minded, so although we can't understand war until we are there, no one who signs up to be on the front line can be surprised by what they face, regardless of how young they are. Most young people decide not to join the military, and saying that young people that do are just kids seems to insult their intelligence or maturity for whatever reasons they have for signing up.

I can't heap all the blame onto the Government or commanders for war, which everyone knows in the army means to occasionally(?) kill. 

Some people have said that if no one volunteered then people would definitely be drafted. I don't believe this is the case. We live in a democracy. If no one volunteers

[Here is the prisoner's dilemma

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, yes, there is a catch ... If both prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail.

The most important feature of this particular situation is that the best overall outcome (meaning the least total number of years served) is gained by both cooperating.  However

In other words, they both cheat and end up with the worst possible outcome.

  There are lots of real world examples of situations which have this property.  The most famous one is probably environmental pollution.  If several people own factories next to a river, once one of them knows all of his competitors are better off cooperating, he has a huge incentive to cheat and pollute by himself.  Maybe his pollution alone isn't enough to destroy the river, and now he can cut costs and charge less for whatever he is selling.  If everyone has this same incentive, they will all pollute and destroy the river.

Modern liberal political systems have a solution to this social problem.  The government can just force people to cooperate

There's an obvious difference between paying a tax and somebody stealing your stuff. 

Its like that Steinbeck quote

In a nutshell, not because of a genuinely logical disagreement with the ideology of collectivism, but because they are totally disillusioned about the importance of the individual. This disproportionate over-estimation of their own importance leads to political and social ideas that ultimately make things worse, for both society and ultimately, the individual. CMV.

By the way, I'm not advocating communism, I'm not advocating blind trust in an authoritarian government, I'm not even being anti-American. I'm suggesting that Americans are disillusioned about the importance of their individuality, which shapes political ideas that seem odd to the rest of the western world. Nothing more, nothing less.

The huge dealbreaker for people in this novel is the fact that people are conditioned to be in a certain caste before they're even born. But isn't this true today aswell? 

I believe that the environment is a huge factor in deciding our behaviors, and it affects us hugely. For example, poor people will most likely remain poor because that's the kind of mindset and environment they often have (this is not to say it's their fault, but the environment before them).

1367713457.0,1dpg8z,"If you're a short guy, you are physically unattractive to women, period.",PlzExterminateMe,87,202, BECAUSE I'M A SHORT GUY WHO IS ABOUT TO TRY DATING FOR THE FIRST TIME

Let's face it: short guys are screwed when it comes to dating. From what I can gather by eavesdropping on female conversations both in real life and on female-centered forums of the internet, while women will tolerate a short guy provided he has made up for his ""defect"" with confidence, money, or whatever, it's apparently not a good idea for short guys to try and make up for their defect, since they run the risk of being labeled a sufferer of Short Man Syndrome.)

To call the female preference for tallness a mere ""preference"" is a gross understatement. 

First of all, I can confidently say that nearly every single female, when she envisions her ideal man, envisions a guy around 6'2"", plus or minus a few inches depending on how tall she is. The envisioned ideal man gets exponentially less attractive as his height decreases linearly. In fact, were this guy 5'5"", it's likely she'd a prefer a 6'2"" guy who is less-than-handsome facially. Which really sucks for short guys who were blessed with Brad Pitt-like facial aesthetics. The curse is permanent.

Second, such as boob size, but the fact is that even the guys with obsessive boob fetishes, if they're straight, don't give a fuck as long as she's pretty: http://i.imgur.com/721Wc9l.jpg. Not to mention the fact a large percentage of men actually prefer small boobs or a completely flat chest. 

Third, so they can look good paraded next to him down the church aisle, and so they can have some tall sons to show off. Since height is associated with status in our culture, having a tall boyfriend or husband is a status symbol. I do know some short guys with hot girlfriends, and I sense that, while the girlfriends love being around the guy, they aren't terribly excited about showing him off to their parents or to other girls. They almost seem embarrassed. I had the displeasure of witnessing an event where a group of girls were talking and after one mentioned that her boyfriend was 5'4"", if you know what I mean. Sad. 

I'll list my answers to some frequently given objections whenever I bring up the hopelessness that myself (5'7"") and other short guys seem to have in the dating world. Then I'd like you to convince me that I'm wrong about all this.

**You're a misogynist because you don't think women are allowed to have preferences.**  Incorrect. I'm not a misogynist and I actually never said anything about whether women ""should be allowed"" to do this or that; and further, or anyone, being shallow or egotistical. What irks me is that short guys are always given by women the disingenuous advice that if they're not succeeding with women, it's only because of their lack of confidence or their general attitude. I think that's insulting to a lot of perfectly normal short guys, who don't even think twice about their height, and who are confident and just trying to test their luck with women, and get immediately shut down under the false pretense that they're just too insecure or whatever. 

**Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. are both your height.** Money is the great equalizer. Bringing money into a discussion, and so they might actually find that when they see their handsome faces on such a small body frame, they're actually significantly less attracted to these guys. Hell .... FDR was able to disguise his paralyzation through TV, so I wouldn't be surprised that these guys can maintain a physically attractive male image through elevator shoes, camerawork, etc. Anyhow, they're rich

**You're just bitter.** Yeah

I'll leave you with a statistic: A 5'6"" guy needs to make $183k/yr more than a 6'0"" guy to be equally attractive. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism)

Consider that the average personal disposable income in China, since the ""1 person"" phrase is so popular, we'll go with that figure as a benchmark, which [is around 370000 USD in the states](http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/20/news/economy/top-1-percent/index.html). This translates into 16 times higher than the average personal disposable income, assuming the entirety of the 370000 is disposable (a good enough estimate). Using this same scale, anyone who has 48000 or more in disposable income makes 16 times more than the average Chinese citizen. [This is around half the nation as of 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Distribution).

So now that the numbers are out of the way, and  therefore are not responsible for the wellbeing of the Chinese I don't believe hold. You can draw classes or groups among people wherever you want to and create categories. Rich people could be one category - the one percent, in fact, could be such a category. Chinese and American are such categories. There is also the geographic argument, but again, rich people tend to be segregated from the poor geographically, at least from what I know about the states.

Second, or whatever rich percentage, works no harder than the rest of the country yet reaps the benefits of those he steps on, is also mirror in the China/America comparison. Our consumer economy depends on cheap labor from China, and those of us making a the aforementioned 48k a year definitely enjoy a higher quality of life because of those folks in China. Further, I argue that they work just as hard, or perhaps even harder

I'd like to think that I've given this topic quite a bit of thought - a bit of personal background - I used to strongly believe in a higher minimum wage, a vast majority of those even under the minimum wage level would in fact be paying out, and not receiving aid [\(source\)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17312819). Why should those of us without as much claim that the incredibly rich should have to redistribute their wealth when we would consider it absurd to redistribute our wealth internationally (I'm sure this is a view that some have, but it isn't common from what I've observed).

To finish - I'd like to just reiterate one of my first points. My view isn't that we should be redistributing international or nationally. It's simply that both views ought to be taken together - either both true or both false.

* The average meat consumption for people in first world countries is far more than is necessary even on a biological level. It is not any healthier and sometimes even less efficient in terms of energy consumption.

* I don't really accept the ""it's nature"" argument because we don't base our morals on nature. We have created ways to counter nature

* We have progressed to the point that we do not need to eat animals to be nutritious (so why breed animals into a pointless life just to kill them for our pleasure of eating them?).

* Producing meat has negative environmental effects. Unlike other products, but there are a lot of things that are pleasurable that we are not allowed to do.

* In another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cyjeb/unless_an_animal_clearly_doesnt_enjoy_whats/c9l8q5w)

* Following in this vein, but it's just another point to consider in the context of these arguments.

* Some say meat eating is integral to our culture

* There's also the whole animal treatment issue before the animals are killed

I'm not saying *all* meat production should be ceased, so I do think each person is allowed a little bit of meat for survival reasons... but I think eating meat as we are now (for most people, every day, or even several times a day) is immoral. 

I saw a few other threads about this but none of them addressed all of my concerns to change my mind. I enjoy eating meat

2. **New comment rule 5**: no ""low effort"" comments. Similar to subreddits like /r/games, etc. etc. we will start removing comments that add nothing to the discussion. Reaction gifs, memes, puns, or one-liner jokes should not be used when commenting in this subreddit.  

3. **Updated wiki**: certain parts of the [Popular Topics wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/populartopics) desperately needed some updating

4. **CMV Post of the day**: consider this one to be an experiment, we want to try out something new rather than just pinning the rules up top: **featuring a CMV thread.**  
   The posts we are looking to feature should have **unique, but I think once things start going we'll figure one out. If an OP of a thread doesn't want their post stickied, we will of course respect that decision.

These changes are what I and the mod team have been thinking about recently. The percentages show how certain we are about these changes. This post is to hear any more ideas from you all before we go through with any changes. Comments

---  
---  

* **Cleaning up the sidebar**  - 100%

    * What we plan to do: Get rid of unnecessary/obvious rules. The rules that we are definitely keeping are Rules III

        * In defense of Rule V: There's been a number of complaints that this rule is unnecessary. However

    * Why we plan on doing this: the rules are super important here. Without everyone following them

* **Removal/revamp of TCMV** - 99%  

    * What we plan to do: get rid of TCMV posts. Either get rid of it entirely with no replacement


    * Why we plan on doing this: TCMV posts haven't been very popular at all. It's unfortunate because they're usually pretty interesting posts where someone can share their stories on what they learned about. However, users who make TCMV threads probably are less willing to have their view changed after sharing their views on these threads. Thus, we want to make a megathread where everyone can share their ""TCMVs"" free from drama.  

* **Tag threads where OP has not responded yet** - 95%  

    * What we plan to do: tag threads as ""No OP replies yet"" until OP actually responds

    * Why we plan on doing this: OPs should be participating in their own threads. This will encourage OP to respond to comments

* **Require OP to expand their posts/be more descriptive/minimum word count** - 90%  

    * What we plan to do: require the OP of a CMV thread to describe their views in more detail. As for how long the description should be

    * Why we plan on doing this: It's my personal philosophy here that *if OP isn't serious about their CMV thread, but also *why* they hold that view**. This why should not be one word or one sentence long, but something that effectively captures your entire reasoning behind your view. This will also help weed out troll threads.  

* **Tag threads where OP has had their view changed** - 80%  

    * What we plan to do: have DeltaBot auto-tag threads where OP has given out deltas.  

    * Why we plan on doing this: so that new users won't have to waste their time convincing an already convinced OP  AND that users with similar viewpoints as OP can see if there are convincing arguments in the thread  

* **Alternatively: tag threads with number of awarded deltas** - 80%  

    * What we plan to do: have DeltaBot auto-tag threads with the number of awarded deltas  

    * Why we plan on doing this: so users can know if a thread is worth responding to  

* **Require mod approval for meta posts** - 75%  

    * What we plan to do: ban meta posts unless they are mod approved either through IRC or modmail  

    * Why we plan on doing this: many of these threads usually involve things we've already discussed internally or already had threads about and are still discussing. If it's a new topic that we feel should get some community input for


* **Reducing repeat/similar questions** - 65%  

    * What we plan to do: reduce heavily repeated topics that the veteran users feel are flooding the sub  

    * How we plan on doing this: not entirely sure. Here are some ideas that have been brought up before:  

        * Link flair like in /r/askscience. Pros: users can easily sort through topics they find interesting. Cons: OPs might not like their threads to be simplified down to tags. We also might not be able to categorize everything effectively.  

        * Weekly ""themes."" Like /r/redditdayof

        * Using the wiki page to categorize topics. Possibly add a new mod who could handle this, so it might go unnoticed.  


        * Outright removal of repeat threads within a certain timeframe. Ex. if we see two abortion threads within the same day

    * Why we plan on doing this: encourage variety. Not have the sub flooded with common topics that you would see elsewhere on Reddit.  

* **Banning Neutral Posts** - 50% (ha)  

    * What we plan to do: ban neutral posts like ""I don't have a strong view on X

    * Why we plan on doing this: CMV should be about an OP wanting to have their view changed on a certain subject. Some would argue that not holding a particular view is itself a view


---  
---  

Some other quick announcements:  

* **NEW MODS**  

    * These are ""trial"" mods that we've hand picked from the community because of their activity and willingness to follow the rules and otherwise greatly contribute to the community! We hope that with their addition we can keep the quality of this subreddit at a high level. With a few weeks of good modding, we might need more mods from the community by that time!  

    * Without further ado, /u/Jazz-Cigarettes, and /u/shokwave**!  

* **Traffic stats**  

    * We've been getting some attention from larger subreddits like /r/bestof and /r/depthhub lately (positive attention, we had a HUGE spike in growth and activity on May 5th and May 6th, no doubt thanks to our subreddit getting cross-linked!

This has caused a lot of people to gripe about the lack of jobs. People feel that they are owed a job for going to college. I'm well aware that this is a result of a promise of the ""American dream"" and the indoctrination in teens that they have to go to college to get a decent paying job

CMV",,74,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bpbth/i_thin_the_word_feminism_has_lost_all_meaning/

However

What I object to is the new wave of feminism that seems to be made up largely of white, in my opinion, put things under the banner of feminism that do not belong there in the classical sense of the word. 

For example, but I have not seen any evidence to firmly support it and I feel that men or women who enjoy pornography should not be shamed for it. When it comes down to it, being against pornography is a personal choice and if you are against it, abstain from it, do not shame others for it. It is not a civil right issue, it is a personal view that should not be imposed upon others in a free society. 

Further more, it is not a civil rights issue and simply a personal preference. Also, men are being more and more objectified in the media as well and while I do not think it is a good thing in either case, I accept that is a part of our society. Sex sells, after all.

Another issue I take is with the ""tumblr feminism"". I have seen posts from the ""I need feminism because..."" movement that ranged from the silly to what could just be called misandry. I see minor issues tacked onto the banner of feminism and I just don't see how it is applicable (fat acceptance

Another gripe I have is any criticism or different opinion is often dismissed as sexism without addressing the argument. While many differing opinions often are merely sexism, particularly a straight white male, will sometimes be told their opinion is not valid because of what they view as ""privilege"" whole ignoring any privileged that females receive.  


I have heard it said that modern feminism is more about total equality for all groups, why call it feminism? Why not just humanitarianism or a similar term? 

What it comes down to, western feminism does not really have the same claim to the world as it does in other parts of the world. I am not saying that women have total equality in the western world, we still have a ways to go. I feel that the rhetoric needs to change.

I would love to discuss this and would like to preface by saying I know the examples that I felt were negative were not the norm and were the acts of individuals and not indicative of the movement

-I can't put an exact age because of how diverse any given teen's experience could be.

-I think many teen users on reddit fall victim to chasing a false sense of superiority over their peers in real life.

-A teen might also be more susceptible to the echo chamber of like-minded ideas here. And if these views/ideas tend to contradict with those of their peers

-Riddled throughout reddit is **extremely explicit** content that isn't discretioned with anything more than a NSFW warning(either in the post title or as a link in the comment section, r/ImGoingToHellForThis  r/gore  ,you get the point, there's a lot of rapidly accessible shock value on here.


^(Also


-Individual subreddits don't exist in a vacuum, and /r/Minecraft  likely browse the main sub-reddits and numerous other subs. So even though a few subs may be deemed age appropriate, the entirety of reddit and its' community is at their feet and has an influence on them.

-Worthwhile discussion and content needs to be read and interpreted correctly in order to benefit anyone. I think younger teens would be less likely to benefit from the worthwhile things on reddit.


Reddit has no notice of an age requirement or suggestion on the registration box

EDIT:
**TLDR**


**-An exact age requirement isn't the point

**-Younger kids have better/ more appropriate things to be doing**

**-Reddit conveys warped expectations and views of their life**

**-Reddit is a potentially dangerous for their developing mind**

**-Reddit's community influence covers the entire site**

There are too many people out their claiming the ""oh what's next? the government killing citizens on US soil with drones?"" Everything is worst case scenario and the sky is always falling.

People in large numbers are stupid, and thoughtful. Too many people subscribe to some Utopian view of the world that if government were tiny the people would be fine and can handle themselves. This is unbelievably naive. People are people and are capable of great good and great evil given the right motivation. Give them a situation with an open outcome and I guarantee that each person chooses something different in the spectrum of possible conclusions. There are good people out their who are still capable of evil and there are evil people out there still capable of good, and there are malcontents set on watching the world burn.

How naive do you have to be to really think that the enemies of the US only exist outside our borders? They live here too

If Snowden did anything, figuratively or literally. How is it that so many people are willing to take what he says at face value? Just because he sacrificed everything to bring us the truth? So did Jesus and I don't believe that story. What were his real motivations? Why travel to Hong Kong first, to China who is more than happy for the secrets of the US government? Then to Russia who would equally be happy for some secrets? Anyone? Did anyone catch that the first 2 countries he ""fled"" to are 2 superpowers who have been our enemies previously? Does anyone know that Ecuador is closer to the US than to Russia and he could have taken a plane to Ecuador for a lot cheaper? Who is bankrolling these travels and accommodations at these destinations? He isn't the plucky hero everyone wants him to be.

And if you really believe that governments don't spy on each other and the US is the only big bad guy then you probably have a tumor. Did you know the Vatican has an intelligence agency all over the world? Think about that next time you go to church to confess. Governments spy on their friends, who we fight and who has switched sides? We need information and acting like our intelligence gathering tools and capabilities are the only big bad evil is naive, simplistic and just small world thinking.

**Premise:** Capitalism is an inherently exploitative system.

**Reasons:**

1. By definition

A common counter: Your employer provides you the opportunity to work which you would not have had otherwise. Your work for them is a net benefit to both of you.

Retort: Where did the employer get the opportunity to provide me with the opportunity? They got a ""head start"", which is essentially given randomly depending on where you are born, does not seem like a compelling reason why someone  should be able to profit off their employee's work.

2. Capitalism will inherently concentrate wealth into a few individuals. As businesses get more efficient at competing

3. The ""voluntary exchange"" principal which capitalism is founded on is fundamentally flawed. Some exchanges may be voluntary

A short description: B.I.G. is essentially a form of social security whose only condition is citizenship (and the age of 18).  Every American citizen

Why I hold this view: B.I.G. can be used to revitalize America and resolve many key debates and issues in one fell swoop.  Examples:

* Net economic benefit: by giving everyone money

* It improves housing and social mobility: by getting a basic wage, owning a home is no longer an unrealistic goal for most folks in the lower rungs of poverty.  

* Labor surplus and minimum wage: Now that you have everybody getting a minimum salary

* Employer provided benefits will become a thing of the past: by providing everyone with a B.I.G.

* Spurs innovation: there are millions of Americans with the talent to do excellent work in fields they are afraid to try their hand in.  For some folks, and innovation keeps America on top.

* It cuts down on the bureaucracy and makes government more efficient.  You will no longer need the Social Security Administration, they do not need these things.

* With that, and social security.  Unemployment becomes a fairly outdated figure...

* Education is also resolved... with everyone getting B.I.G., so you don't need to send your kids to the local public school.  Also, with all the new found social mobility, you will see private schools or private teaching sessions becoming more commonplace, providing a more involved and intimate learning environment for kids.

* The distribution of wealth in the US will become more equitable, they will be able to enrich themselves in a way not previously known to be possible.

...and now for the biggest reasons:

* It's already being done in an inefficient manner: Right now, medicaid, social security, and when all else fails: disability.  Not to mention SNAP.  **These programs fails because they reward failure**, in many instances, it's simply cheaper and easier to stay on disability or welfare than to find and do work.  So why bother?

* It's inevitable: as formerly labor-intensive jobs like manufacturing and farming become automated

1370850976.0,1g18a0,I don't respect the decision to be transsexual. CMV.,hiramugrant,72,22,160,"First off

1. I have always believed (perhaps incorrectly) that transsexuals and transgenders cast away their assigned gender (or sometimes sex) to refute gender roles.  But by embracing *any* gender role at all (i.e. casting away the male gender role to become a female)

2. I feel transgenders (those who seek physical alteration) fundamentally deny themselves of who they really are, you should be able to define yourself, but realistically you must accept the cards you have been dealt.

Again

I am sorry if I miss-used any words/didn't use the correct words to describe sexuality.  Hopefully someone can CMV so I can respect the decision transsexuals make.

**edit:**
Many comments seem to be saying being transsexual/transgender is a coping mechanism.  I don't believe it's an appropriate coping mechanism.  To me
on the people, buy into them more and legitimize them.  Aren't people supposed to act like themselves?  Why do people define themselves with gender?

Some points people have made:
1. *Someone in a male body can be born with a female brain*--I don't believe this.  Please provide scientific evidence suggesting this is true.
2. *There is no difference between those who claim they are a different gender and those who claim they are a different species*--I think this is a valid and interesting point and would like to hear more conversation.
3. *There is a gene many transgender people share*--correlation does not prove causation.  I don;t believe just because you have a ""genetic predisposition"" to change gender meas you should actually do it or pay any mind to gender in the first place.

Thank you for all the comments

**edit2:**
People keep reiterating that a man (i.e. has penis) can be born with a physiologically female brain (brain with characteristics usually found in the female brain).  I understand this.  I accept this.  Some people claim that a brain is inherently born with a *gender identity*.  I don't think this is totally out of the question, why is it appropriate for him to wear makeup to fix this perceived problem.  I think it's ok for a man to wear makeup if he likes it; I don't think it's ok for a man to completely embrace most female gender roles in order to fix his sexual hardware incompatibility.  I also understand people do this to cope with problems, I just think this is not a good way to do so.

Again, he will always have y-chromosomes and will never be completely ""sexually compatible"".

**edit3:**
Alright

Transsexuality begins at or before birth. Transsexuality causes a person to believe there is an internal incompatibility within the body, emotional, and personality changes. I may never understand why these desires to change sex arise, just as I may never understand why people hoard garbage or are shy.
Transgenders *may possibly* use masculinity and femininity as a tool to legitimize the change in sex. An analogy might be that a shy person uses a persona to deal with social problems.

If I begin to ask why it is ok to support gender stereotypes
Basically I now view transsexuality as a disease rather than some strange

I may start attending LGBT meetups and meetings to to be exposed to these people. I feel if I'm around real people and see them as more than transsexuals I will have a better chance of empathizing with them. I have no intentions of putting anyone down or talking to them tactlessly (as I do online).

They may also not be doing anything to increase their personal stock with other interesting people, so others don't care to engage them because someone who spends their free time playing beer pong and watching Family Guy doesn't seem to be approachable to someone who has more engaging hobbies and passions.

In the bigger picture, that nobody thinks that *they're* the stupid ones.  I think the ""people are stupid"" bit goes hand in hand with ""people are evil"" and ""everything is going to shit"" and other fear-mongering lines.

1. Pollution is killing off species and warming is destroying habitats. If enough species die

2. Disasters caused by global warming have already displaced millions of people around the globe. Also

3. Food resources will grow scarcer from the above stated reasons. Ironically, we are going to see war increase as a scramble to grab the last remaining energy and food supplies.

Okay. Gays. Let's talk about them for a second (because they're just not getting enough media coverage these days). Because seriously


First: I grew up in a home where man + woman = good and man + man or woman + woman was bad. Morally wrong on grounds of religion. And I'm perfectly okay with that. Aside from that, anyway. A man has a penis, it goes into the vagina, babies are born (generally speaking).


So what IS it with gays? How can they be attracted to the same sex at all? It seems like all of the gay people must have a hormone imbalance. ""I was born this way, people with six fingers and five toes in total should also get married to the ocean. Seriously, wtf. It makes no sense.


And frankly


Furthermore, depending on where you live) pay taxes! And if you're in America, married people are still getting the stiff end of the stick on healthcare. 
There are other things that go along with marriage besides the whole, this generation might get that passed, but have the gays of this generation even begun to fathom what it will do 5, 10, 20 generations from now?


Also


Also, they JUMP all over you and metaphorically rub your face into the ""piss"" that you wrote about them.

They make their gayness seem like it's the #1 important thing in the world. And it's not. Just because I have an opinion on something does not automatically make me wrong. It's an opinion. A voicing. But to have a gay person do that repeatedly makes the rest of the ""gay party"" look like a bunch of misled

You, someone called you out on your tight pants, or shoved you on the train just to be rude. Whatever. I have a vagina. Vaginas have been pushing out mankind for hundreds of thousands of years. We've been vandalized by men for centuries. We're still getting vandalized. Hell, women in 3rd world countries still are struggling for basic rights. Oh, your penis had a bad day? It is mandatory for me to feel sorry for you and take up your cause? Hell no. Didn't think so.


It seems like men + men relationships are taking the nurturing responsibility away from women. Their touting of themselves and their ability to nurture takes away from the female as being the nurturer in the home for a hell of a long time in mankind's history. And that seems wrong. Sperm and sperm don't make babies. Eggs and sperm make babies. You would still need a woman to give that gay couple a child. And what does that leave the mother? A childless mess.

The idea lies primarily in automation. I've seen statistics that claim that if wage increase paced productivity, seems to be increasing at a rate that is following the adoption of automation.  Unless someone can explain how we're suddenly more productive people.

Therefore, I work for a tech company with a number of sites across the planet, and we hire at least hundreds of people at each site. If the US minimum wage increases beyond a certain point, an automation option that can be rolled out in a few years could be implemented instead, reducing our workforce requirement by 50-66%.

http://forbiddentruth.8k.com

I did not share or even know about most of the ideas on this website until I stumbled upon it by accident. I have now read every essay on it

I'm going to pasting some text that sums up why I think this. 

""Two human beings of opposite gender agree to have sexual intercourse with each other. This act carries with it the possibility of creating a third, and autonomous life form, as a result of the male sperm and the female egg commingling. Under the deranged doctrine of every society to have ever existed in the Modern Era, those two adults, simply by engaging in a sex act, are officially decreed to be the unquestioned Legal Owners of any and all biological creations that come about as a result of the sex act. Even though they are human beings living in a supposedly civilized, intellect-based society, to determine whether or not either one or both of the biological creators desires, amazing

Have you diseased creatures ever watched the cable/satellite channel ""Animal Planet""? If you have, and immediately after birth, the observation becomes even more intense. Will the biological creator accept or reject it's offspring?? The staff stands by, watching carefully, ready to rush in and seize the newborn baby animal, if the mother or anyone else in the cage shows any sign of rejecting or hurting the newborn. The fact that your societies would mock and consider ridiculous the notion of mandatory observation and monitoring of human ""parents"" in this manner, is just one of the hundreds of proofs, undeniable proofs that exist

Every society on planet earth has the ability to easily stop 98% of all children who are significantly abused, every society on planet earth, in clinging to and legitimizing Sacred Family Unit mythology, in fact deliberately chooses to commit genocide upon it's own children. Physical, mental, emotional, sexual genocide and murder.""

To the best of my knowledge no society has ever even discussed mandatory parental competency testing. In this essay

http://forbiddentruth.8k.com/childabuse.html

halfway down the author completely lays out a workable solution to this and created a complete parental competency exam

Children are basically sub-human pieces of property in our society. They are used a poison containers for their legal owners. What is a poison container? 

Again pasted 

""The actual original creator of this phrase is, as relates to child abuse, thusly: The Child As Poison Container: The main psychological mechanism that operates in all child abuse involves using children as what I have termed poison containers--receptacles into which adults project disowned parts of their psyches, so they can control these feelings in another body without danger to themselves. Rather than the child being able to use the parent to detoxify its fears and anger, the parent instead injects his or her bad feelings into the child and uses it to cleanse his or herself of depression and anger. End quote. In general, I absolutely agree with this insightful observation and definition of Lloyd's as being accurate. However, I also expand the definition in a broader way, with complete malice aforethought, to ""detoxify"" themselves by torturing the human beings who remind them, every adult was once a child
Here is an essay by Lloyd deMause where he explains the poison contain in depth and how child abuse has shaped human history.""

http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/05_history.html

I just wanna note that you may think the website's creator is 'nutty' but Lloyd deMause is a very respected psychohistorian.

""Indeed, too, the routine assault of children has been society's most effective way of maintaining its collective emotional homeostasis.""-------Lloyd deMause

I want to give a quick description of the sacred family unit. Directly quoted from the website: ""The Sacred Family Unit is an artificial societal construct, and brainwashing citizen-slaves into agreeing to emotionally and legally enslave themselves to each other, and in most cases, to cathartically cope with the horrors of life by creating and assuming joint ownership of their own slaves, via procreation. In a nutshell: For the societal purpose of more easily controlling the life paths of all citizen-slaves, they are terrorized and brainwashed into agreeing to pair up into couples, under force of law, society awards them to possess

Sacred Family Unit mythology forms a cornerstone, domesticate, and dictate the life paths of virtually all citizen-slaves. The depth and multi-layered complexity of Sacred Family Unit mythology is truly astonishing in scope. Human beings are told that they are ""free"", by so-called democratic societies, and yet the layers of cultural and legal fascism that enchain them as slaves to both society and to each other, the latter via Sacred Family Unit mythology, are literally unbreakable. ""

http://forbiddentruth.8k.com/images/gacy1.gif

""This is John Wayne Gacy, as a helpless child, to his sperm creator, who proceeded to engage in the ritual torture of John throughout his childhood, beating him regularly, throwing him across rooms, emotionally terrorizing John by telling him he was a stupid, sissy. Instead of falling to your knees and begging John to forgive you, a societally sponsored legal murder

This is an example of how this child abuse and child slavery actually cause society itself to be the creators of those who commit these gruesome types of crimes. 

Sorry if that's long

These are just things I'm sick of people annoying me about when I try and discuss this website and the ideas it espouses. I feel they hold ZERO credible argument. 

Any notion that I have committed violent acts or condone it in my personal life.

ANY claim about my personal life

The notion that I 100% agree with EVERYTHING on this website and think it is infallible.

The notion that my worldview makes me immoral. Believe me

The assertion that the creator of the website is mentally ill

The notion that these ideas are 'crazy' and thus not correct.

""OMG Charles Manson's on the front page""

""He called me a creature. How mean!""

The idea that him capitalizing truth and not capitalizing words like god is 'petty'.

The idea of the websites creator calling himself the ""Seer of Forbidden Truth"" is dumb or crazy. Take a good look at your username

Typical Grocery store has 1% profit margin.

Typical Grocery store runs a 'sales per labor hour' of $150.

It seems to me though that if this is the case, then their 'costs per labor hour' go up just $10.

This means the price of the basket of goods sold in a typical labor hour would have to increase from $150 to $160 to maintain the grocery stores current levels of profitabillity.  **note that I'm not saying they have to sell an extra $10 worth of stuff

So far then, from say, $10 to $20, or from $7.50 to $17.50.

I think that if we had an across the board increase in minimum wage by $10

1) A dramatic increase in the spending power of minimum wage employees

2) An increase in prices - in this case

3) An increase in items sold

CMV.

EDIT: created a spreadsheet showing what happens to a supply chain as the cost of labor changes.  It turns out that the 7% number above is understated

EDIT2: Note that in the spreadsheet included, I assumed fixed profit for the business.  EG: If something costs the business $100 to create, and their previous margins are 20%, then they sell it for $120.  If their costs increase to $150 to create, they maintain the 20% margin and so sell it for $180.  This results in LARGER price increases with added steps to the supply chain, and more net profit for the business, assuming the same number of goods sold.  Even with this assumption

* If an author or journalist publishes something and mentions that (s)he is atheist, Harris, Hitchens, Sagan, etc.), there is still an underlying, unspoken 'rule' that if you come out as atheist, when really it is a legitimate viewpoint that potentially relieves one of unhealthy moral reasoning.

The circle-jerking in /r/atheism that *actually is* circle-jerking is when atheists pat each other on their backs for being smarter than everyone else and ""better"" than theists....

However, atheists are given so little publicity that **/r/atheism is practically the best platform they have**. Sure, some of it is very circle-jerky in that one atheist will upload a predictable quote from Carl Sagan and some other atheist will upvote it pretty much automatically... but no real movement is complete without its share of common-denominator messages that start somewhere and end up being at least somewhat instrumental in initiating a change in people's predispositions to treat each other a certain way.

**TL;DR** ... I'm not saying /r/atheism is the best way for atheists to end discrimination. But it is a very large forum full of atheists who need to support each other because they are a discriminated group. Though the discrimination isn't as tragic as ""separate bathrooms for black people"" or anything like that, who may not even feel safe coming out as 'atheist' in their real lives, need this sort of thing to remind them that their point of view is not bullshit and to remind them that they don't deserve to be discriminated against.

I believe that God is more evil than Satan, he is simply lying.

It's difficult to find actual examples in the Bible of Satan acting evil, then this would be evil, but if actions speak louder than words, there's very little evidence of God being good.

* He's incredibly jealous

* He killed who-knows-how-many people with the Flood.

* He once killed 40 kids for calling a guy bald.

* He wants his followers to be willing to kill their own children because he said so. (Sure

* He seems to be totally okay with rape.

Probably a number of more examples that don't come to mind just now. /r/atheism can certainly provide pages and pages. [Here's](http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/3582) a link with a list and citations.

What has Satan actually done? Sure, which is one of those things that falls under the ""against god"" category; I think that knowledge of good and evil is a pretty good thing. He killed Job's family, *with God's complete approval*.

I don't want to feel this way because I can't just hate 3.5 billion people but when it comes to the dating world I feel quite jaded by the endeavour.

So, I meet a women and wish to pursue a relationship with her, I have to make the first move. Then, should the women choose to accept me, I have to offer a date place and time.

I don't understand how so many women can say they'll break up with a partner if they don't go down on them. Women expect men to do all the work in the bed (overwhelmingly they prefer a dominant partner) yet when it also benefits them for their man to be temporarily submissive by performing cunninglingus it is required. Instead of saying you want a dominant partner why not just say you want one that does all the work? If a women is submissive and a man dominant in a relationship

Another thing that bothers me is when women say they just wanted to be treated like a person

Men have to constantly censor themselves and their behavior when trying to get with a women. That's why you feel like you are objectified, cannot act like I do around my friends as I do you because you would be repulsed. You know how when women have a problem they want empathy, reassurance, compassion, and the such from their boyfriend? I'm listening to you and your problems and just cycling through ""I'm sorry to hear that"", ""I can't imagine how hard that must be for you"", and ""Let me know if I could do anything to help."" If a guy friend came to me with a problem I treat him like a person and we try to collaborate to fix it. If you want to be egalitarian you need to be it on all fronts

Men in general do not feel desired by women. Men buy the gifts, from her pedestal, wish men would stop putting her on pedestals. We have to constantly reassure you that you're beautiful, not fat, not crazy, etc. while all of men's emotions are completely ignored for that of the women's. Women get annoyed by physical compliments while most men have never even been complimented or can at least count on one hand the amount of times. Even in a relationship it often feels like you're not even physically attracted to us but just likes what we can do for you.

Anyways, and alone. I'm actually 20 and have pretty much kept all of this in my head and never let in manifest in any way. I try to be a good person and have had great and fulfilling relationships. Don't think I'm also not aware of the problems women face and how they are discriminated against. I'm aware many can only get off through clitoral stimulation, that they are only viewed as sexual creatures and seldom seen for their intelligence, and preyed against sexually, in the workplace, and society. I feel such cognitive dissonance because gender relations are so complicated and changing every day and there is so much inequality and discrimination on both sides that I'm aware of that it's hard to just shut off and recognize most people try to be good.

Noun
1. A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.
2. The action of plotting or conspiring.

I think the evidence of George W. Bush lying to the American public about why we invaded Iraq is pretty obvious. To the point to where I immediately disregard the opinions of people who can't seem to piece together the logic and see that it was a lie and that there were ulterior motives at play. I'm not here to get opinions on that topic, if I'm going to be a rational human being, I need to accept the fact that this means a number of things.

1. A conspiracy, most publicly scrutinized of offices in the entire country.

2. There was an entire power base that was supposedly ideologically opposed to those in office and had a vested interest in outing their corruption.

3. The evidence for the conspiracy is so widely known in our culture that it has become a running joke and a go-to gag/topic among stand-up comics and pundits.

4. There has been zero accountability, although largely known, isn't taken seriously at all. Even the next administration, which had a strong political incentive to do serious political damage to their opponents by outing the conspiracy, not only did nothing to hold anyone accountable, but actively urged the public to ""move on"" and put it out of their minds.

So the problem I have is that it seems to me that people who seem to get that Bush was lying to get us into a war also seem to be the people(in my experience

On a side note, but that's because I've analyzed the evidence before I made my decision, not because I refused to take it seriously in the first place. I also understand that some people that believe Bush was lying are also open minded to other conspiracies, I'm not referring to those people.

I believe that the extraversion–introversion trait is a mere [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory), *2* and *n*; you qualify *more* as an extrovert because you're *closer* to the average view of an extrovert.

I feel there is no reason we can't use half the space to only have tombstones in remembrance of fallen loved ones. 

We have acres of land right now that cannot be used to build schools, simply because people cannot let go of their loved ones decomposing, lifeless bodies. So they are left in the ground and now that ground is no longer usable.

Further I think the manipulation involved in funerals, especially when used on religious, spiritual, and vulnerable people in their most vulnerable position is abhorrent. 

We are in a day and age where we know the dead don't need their bodies, which is perhaps why I feel the way I do), and getting rid of the remains should not be viewed as disrespecting the dead.

This practice is ridiculous

Change my view.

So I'm just not understanding why the term rape culture is needed to describe a few assholes, because assholes will always exist.

Some even say that rape culture exists because we have to warn women that rape is a possibility and we give them basic protection tips like don't go out alone at night.

Secondly, don't even get me started. The genius behind those proofs are just incredible. Psychology, sociology, biology, chemistry. Philosophy, art, culture, 60 years remaining to savour it all as much as I can

The cost of a relationship seems very high too. Aside from the intellectual price, socialising to find a suitable mate, buying presents, just general interaction. There's the monetary cost of supporting a spouse, possibly kids, and constructing a safe environment for them and position them to succeed in life. I just find the cumulative cost to be not worth the happiness it might generate.

Third, I'm beginning to realise that conflict is incredibly widespread. I can deal with conflict at the friendship level, but at the relationship level the emotional investment makes everything so much more serious, and I don't enjoy that.

Fourth, I choose to love them more. I find that quite true and irrational; to a large extent I feel love is a meme largely supported by the biochemical cocktail our brains deliver during attraction and arousal. All that stuff about it being complex and multi-faceted is just a result of cognitive dissonance. I get that it's a practical rationalisation for reproductive success, and having experienced it I don't deny that it is deliciously addictive; I just can't take the popular idea of romantic love seriously.

The Reddit admins have (literally just) implemented a new feature that allows a subreddit to hide comment scores for a set period of time.  

I think admin Deimorz goes into good detail about it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/  

Now

1) Should we implement it?  

2) If we do implement it

---  

Some things to consider (for anyone who is confused by the post by Deimorz):  

1) Voting still affects which responses rise to the top. *Clarification*: the ""best"" posts by vote count will *still* show up on top, you will not be able to tell by how much the first post outscores the second post. Even so, all posts are not ""weighted"" equally in this instance. The top post will still be the top post, and the second top post will still be the second top post.  

The purpose of this is to make the vote count no longer visible and thus limit how much people vote based on others' votes.  

2) This will level the playing field between users who keep the CSS enabled and users who don't keep the CSS enabled/are on mobile devices. The problem we had before when we ""hid"" the downvote arrow using a CSS trick was that it had no affect on the latter two categories. This is a site wide change that will fix that problem

3) You will not be able to tell how people are voting against you

Part of me knows men can be raped by women. Because you know

But for the most part I'm just really confused. I'm having trouble coming to terms with how it's possible for women to rape men. Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)? Although I'm aware that it would be emotionally damaging... Back to my whole ""enjoy it"" point, if you flip it around, I'm MORE than aware that it would be absurd to say to women victims that they could've just enjoyed it. 

I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, etc. I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it ""ridiculous""). I also remember seeing a tweet on one of those true fact accounts on Twitter. The tweet said something along the lines of a man was raped at knife point by five women (his wives?

1372775167.0,1hhxrp,"I don't really agree with Richard Dawkins's ""meme theory"". CMV.",Gehalgod,49,14,29,"In Chapter 11 of *The Selfish Gene*

Dawkins suggests that these *memes* are like the genes in the primordial soup of human culture. This means that they are self-replicating cultural ideas (tunes, etc.).

Dawkins posits the existence of these *memes* in order to give us an explanation (via mechanisms that were well-established earlier in the book when talking about genes) of why humans are ""special"" in comparison to other species. We have culture

The view sounds attractive because it allows us humans to carry on thinking of ourselves as ""better"" than other species without ever leaving behind the idea of complexity arising only through evolution by natural selection. We get to have it ""both ways"".

But the idea breaks down for me due to a few things. A couple of them are excerpts from Dawkins himself where he expresses some doubt (page numbers taken from the 30th anniversary paperback edition):

**1. Page 193:**

&gt; The survival value of the God meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides of superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence.

&gt; ...

&gt; Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that this account of the survival value of the god meme begs the question. In the last analysis they wish always to go back to 'biological advantage'. To them it is not good enough to say that the idea of a god has 'great psychological appeal'. They want to know *why* it has great psychological appeal. Psychological appeal means appeal to brains

**2. Page 194-5**

&gt; This brings me to the third general quality of successful replicators: copying-fidelity. Here I must admit that I am on shaky ground. At first sight it looks as if memes are not high-fidelity replicators at all. Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people. The memes are being passed on to you in altered form. This looks quite unlike the particulate, all-or-nothing quality of gene transmission. It looks as though meme transmission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending.

I feel as if this lack of copying-fidelity combined with the worries of Dawkins's colleagues expressed on page 193 gives us too much doubt for this theory of *memes*.

Besides this lack of high fidelity in copying, it means that memes automatically shouldn't be considered replicators. Two different selfish replicators can have a mutual relationship.

I don't think Dawkins is necessarily wrong when he says that our genes' survival machines (namely our bodies) provide the primordial soup in which memes can replicate. This idea seems to be explained well enough in the book. However, the way genes replicate.

My personal gripe with the meme theory ultimately boils down to the questions that arise when we try to decide what counts as ""one meme"". For instance, and the language one expresses it in is a secondary feature.... But, you see, it's *not* a secondary feature. Not really. The survival of the meme depends on how well one generation can express it to the next. The language skills and whatnot of one generation determines how well the ""meme"" will do... it's not all up to the meme just to replicate itself. I think Dawkins is contradicting himself a bit here.

Dawkins defines one gene as ""one replicator"" or ""one unit of natural selection""

If we are to judge what ""counts"" as a meme, fecundity, and copying-fidelity as we've seen with genes. Instead of saying that memes are ""competing"" for brain space, it seems that humans are ""competing"" for that which will help the survival of our genes. And since we are highly evolved, these resources include ideas and knowledge of certain methods as well.

tl;dr -- I disagree with the meme theory of Dawkins based on the idea that we don't have enough conceptual evidence to say that memes are really units of natural selection or units with any sort of copying-fidelity that we find in genes. The survival of a meme does not depend merely on its ability to copy itself. I have posted relevant quotes from *The Selfish Gene* above,False,,t5_2w2s8,1372870158.0,,points,t3_1hhxrp

Many of my reasons for being a compatibilist are outlined by Daniel Dennett in his book

The problem I originally had with compatibilism is that it allows our status of having ""free will"" to change depending on situations external to us

It just didn't seem *good* enough to say that we have free will

I have since come to change my position on free will. I believe that human beings have it even if determinism is universally true. I believe that determinism is necessary for free will, i.e., I'm not just confirming free will as a means of making sense of moral responsibility.~~

Here are my reasons for being a compatibilist

**(I) Control is the type of free will worth wanting.**

Dennett's example is quite good in my opinion. He writes about a pilot who not only has direct

**(II) Indeterminacy and free will make no sense together.**

There are a few points I could make here. The first is that if indeterminacy does not give us free will based on the fact that if ""choices"" are non-deterministic

I could weight the factors of two of my options (consciously or otherwise

Feeling as though we have free will is a prerequisite to actually having it. I find this point sort of self-explanatory but rather important to mention here. The ""feeling"" that we have free will *is* the same as deliberation

&gt; Let’s say you are shopping for a new pet. You have your selection narrowed down to two dogs: a poodle and a German shepherd. You cannot take both dogs home. Your friend, then Jack will adopt the dog you don’t want. If you can’t make up your mind in a week, then Jack will adopt both dogs.

&gt; You seemingly begin to deliberate about which dog you want. Which one suits your lifestyle better? Which one is friendlier? Which one is cleaner? Which one will be easier to train? A multitude of questions come to mind coupled with potential answers depending on your prior experience of dogs. Let’s say that in the first three days

&gt; Any deliberation that can really be called “deliberation” brings us closer to a choice. To be closer to a choice means that it is less likely that we will choose an alternative. If we want to say that randomness can give us free will, then deliberation must mean something with respect to choosing because deliberating is the same as the feeling that we are choosing). Randomness giving us free will would mean that, even if 100% of the criteria you deliberate over suggest that the German shepherd is the better choice, you are still just as likely (whatever “likely” might mean in the face of pure randomness) to choose the poodle. It makes no sense to say that this sort of randomness grants us free will. And if we make a choice with no deliberation, we are choosing without method. This is randomness as well in the everyday sense that we are either letting indescribable events determine our thinking, or we are surrendering to causality. In neither case do we find the type of free will that libertarians want to find.

This is the main problem I have with libertarian free will. They have to find a way to explain how indeterminacy gives us free will

**(III) Libertarian philosophers confuse determinism with fatalism.**

One libertarian author I read (Helen Steward, then no conscious creature would ever have a reason to interfere and ""settle a matter"" in order to steer it away from it's determined path. This is, needless to say, a blatant confusion of determinism with [fatalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism).

**(IV) We are only moved to act by reason and desires.**

Reason and desires are not things that are up to us. They are this way by definition

Reason and beliefs are the same way, *that* action was done because of a prior belief, and we will eventually reach a point where we have to say that one's predispositions to act were based on something that was not up to the agent himself.

**(V) Hard determinists are making unreasonable demands.**

They want to know how it is that we can ""will our own wills"". But willing our own wills does not make sense and so there is no way to tell whether it is a desirable form of free will. If determinism is universal, with more ""higher order control"". Willing our own wills is nonsensical and the idea is not relevant.

**TL;DR** ... I am a compatibilist. I believe that free will and determinism are not only compatible, and it is determinism (not fatalism) that allows us to be driven from concrete reasons and desires into action. We have, in Dennett's words, ""the only type of free will worth wanting.""

I believe that Muhammad, the scientific method, and believe that science is an important tool for improving civilisation and tackling ignorance and superstition.

But what are my reasons for the belief in the title? Well let me construct my argument for you.

* Religion is meant to encourage people to dedicate themselves to a greater good. Islam especially is about following almost a code of conduct, regardless of their views. If you don't believe this point, I would ask you to envision an American president who isn't Christian.

Others have perverted their religion to their own political views, but allowing commentators to taint the silent majority by the actions of an extreme minority.

* Religious people who are indoctrinated with their religion or who have grown up with it do not fully understand why they perform certain rituals

This point extends to religious people who are selective in what rituals they perform, or the Christian who doesn't turn the other cheek. Their hypocrisy undermines everything they are supposed to believe in. My argument is if you actually believe in the moral merit of the message, how can you follow it by any less than 100%?

* Then comes the worst of all. The narrow mindedness. Have you ever been in an argument with someone who seems to be trying to convert you, or converting people, it's about setting an example through your actions.

A very common thing I do while editing is type a line, this is ""esc-&gt;(move cursor to typo)-&gt;i-&gt;(correct typo)-&gt;esc-&gt;(move cursor to where it was before)-&gt;i"" which is way less efficient than ""(move cursor to typo)-&gt;(correct typo)-&gt;(move cursor to where it was before)"". Yes I know that you can navigate with the arrow keys but most people seem to think that is a bad idea for some reason, or somehow makes you less efficient, even though it saves keystrokes. Another example is saving a document, which takes 3-5 keystrokes in vim depending on if you are currently in insert mode or not (esc-&gt;:-&gt;w-&gt;enter-&gt;i) vs 2 in other editors (ctrl+s) and those 2 can basically be hit in parallel so its even better. In fact the only time that I've noticed that vim is more efficient when editing text is when I want to delete everything until the next closing square bracket, or move the cursor to the next occurrence of a character.

4) Using the keyboard instead of the mouse is not necessarily faster. Obviously the keyboard is great for many things, but its really not that far, and its more automatic than pressing a key sequence that depends heavily on the where you want to put the cursor relative to where it is now.

5) The interface is undiscoverable. In other editors, I can look through the menus until I find it. Then, once I do find it, the shortcut is listed right there, so I don't have to do it with the menus next time. Also, many people don't know this but menus can be navigated without touching the mouse using a combination of the alt keys, windows key, where if you think vim can do something but don't know how

6) Other minor nitpicks that are mostly about personal preference. I don't like the undo model, the text that appears is almost never what I expect. (I often copy something with the intent of pasting it in 20-30 seconds, then do a bunch of other edits before pasting)

I really want to like vim, change my view. A couple requests though: please don't tell me ""you need to use it for x amount of time before it becomes good."" With the potential exception of #5, all of my complaints listed above apply to vim experts. Also, please don't compare vim to notepad. Compare vim to other full featured text editors. Almost every feature people brag about in vim exists in Sublime Text, Notepad++, and the editors built into all the IDEs I've used.",,,points ,

It has some variation from series to series but generally dictates that there can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilizations.

It is generally regarded as a moral philosophy used to guide star trek captains:

""The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules. It is a philosophy, the results are invariably disastrous.""
—Jean-Luc Picard

So maybe there is hypothetical evidence that interfering with alien cultures is always detrimental from star trek history that the viewer never knows.  But as a moral philosophy and a practical method it seems stupid.  

Here are the problems with it:

1)	It seems to be propagated by the naturalistic fallacy and bans playing God

2)	There is a disturbing application of Social Darwinism.  Only the fittest civilizations which can avoid their own destruction and can achieve technical wonders on their own are worthy of survival

3)	It can easily be used as an excuse for inaction when there are tough decisions to make.

4)	The evidence we have in the real world generally indicates that technology is a good thing

I am not part of any religion and I believe that the right of polygamy should be applied equally regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

Here are my arguments:

* I do believe that it is possible of loving multiple people romantically at the same time. Many people do love their children equally

* For anyone who would claim that we are naturally monogamous, “genetic monogamy appears to be extremely rare in humans,” and “social monogamy is not common, ... often reduc[ing] to serial polygyny in a biological sense”. This means that monogamy is not the predominant mating system among the hominid lineage and probably never was](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy).

* I believe that the main determinant for any successful relationship is excellent communication, people should also be able to work on their insecurities. I think that insecurity is the main factor leading to jalousy. If insecurity is not present and communication about values and boundaries is established, I don't see why one person could not simply be glad that their partner is happy. Therefore, I also believe that any relationship could be functional if everyone honestly and extensively discussed values and boundaries beforehand.

As I move into adult life, Canada, Australia, Europe and Scandinavia must open their borders and become halfway houses for every down-on-his-luck asshole who wants a slice of the welfare pie. Why is it these nations only that must become less white? Give up their culture, or at least ""make room"" for the kinds of people we are traditionally aligned against (see: the difficulties second and third generation Islamic immigrants have integrating into European society)? Why doesn't Japan have to become more diverse? Russia? South America or Africa?

And then at the institutional level, even non-American ""diverse"" whites, are under the microscope to make sure none of us flip out and start saluting the swastika. Meanwhile, the paper is running articles about racial crime ""quotas"", saying the campus police are morally obligated to arrest more white men to match the spike in black male crime (this year we've had high-profile incidents of black students expelled for fighting, firearms on campus, rioting, theft, to make room for a more diverse student body! I work on campus, but *I'm* the one required to take ""tolerance"" and ""integrative"" courses?

I recognize these are individuals and that you can't judge a group by their behavior. I work and learn with people from around the world and different backgrounds, to become a part of the America tapestry. Meanwhile, so many more simply want a free ride on my back. People make a big deal about, ""Oh, it's 20XX, the white man's burden is gone, get with the times! We don't live in the 40s anymore!"" But I feel like the burden has shifted, but I would never consider it anything as a last resort

The thing that annoys me most, but we're too swept up by the feel good, ""I'm not racist at all!"" ideology to realize we're blowing it all on a dream, a fairy tale. And people say, ""Well, the benefit of diversity isn't for YOU! It's for them!"" So what? What the fuck does that mean? I have to labor so that people who legitimately hate me and my people can ""succeed""? We're stuck in a fucking twilight zone where western cultures bitch about how evil the West is, while everyone else either tries to modernize and meet western standards or moves to the West anyway. And when you ask people, ""What's so good about diversity?"" the response is always something as inane as

This is for the following reason:  The value of my one vote is zero.  Either: the election will not be close, and even in this case - the decision will be taken out of my hands, as with the '00 election in Florida which was nowhere near as close as one vote.

Secondly, from an economical (or even game theoretical) point of view, voting is an irrational decision.  The only reason to do it is to be *seen* doing it. 

Arguments I've heard for voting that I find pretty weak:

* Slippery slope arguments: 'maybe you are just one rain drop

* Similar: If people like you don't vote

* If you don't vote in an election then you have no right to complain when the government doesn't act the way you want.

* It's your civic duty - 'your grandfather fought in the war so that you could vote...'

These are all irrational arguments if you accept my assumption that my vote has zero weight.  Unless I'm actively trying to stop others from voting, but my vote had no influence on that, and it can't affect how others like me vote positively or negatively.  If I am just voting out of 'civic duty', then my vote is just a gesture.  I am happy to lie about whether or not I voted if it will make you feel better, but I like to think I act rationally, and for me, expending effort so that I can say I was part of an election is not a rational decision.

- religious organizations often espouse beliefs that its constituents don't always agree with, yet the leadership of the church has been extremely anti gay, both socially and politically in the last ten years. Many kids who grow up in a religion never really develop their unique personality because their entire lives are defined by the religion.

- in the us

- these main parties are so convoluted with power that they actually try to stop smaller parties from gaining any political ground. These parties are in power and want to stay that way.

The answer is that even those Africans with access to contraceptives still desire large families. There are many reasons for this

I quote:

&gt;“The main reason why people want to have many children is because of the prophet's saying that: 'marry and produce a good generation for I shall be proud of your great number on the Day of Judgment'” (Female

&gt;“The Yoruba regard children as legacy. They have as many as possible, South West, Urban).

[In Nigeria, but rather, the desire of people to have a large number of children. 

[Bongaarts wrote:](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3720911.html)

&gt;However, and if so, how?7 Reducing preferences has been a low priority throughout Asia and Latin America, where desired family size has declined to near replacement levels. But Sub-Saharan Africa is different. Although social and economic development may help reduce its high desired family size, the process could take decades; thus, massive population growth is inevitable. 

In some African countries, or economic necessity. If people can not afford to feed their children, this may finally force a limit on their fertility.

A natural decline to this high population growth is unlikely:

&gt;At the time of the last survey, the decline in the Sub-Saharan African countries averaged just 0.13 children per woman. At this slow pace, it will take more than a century to reach a desired family size of two children.

**The question then becomes: Why do African cultures desire such large families compared to non-African cultures?**

The deeper answer may lie in biology. [Organisms vary on a spectrum of /r/K selection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory) A species that is more ""r"" has many children, and as a result has fewer children, but more of these children will survive into adulthood.

Humans overall are a very K selected species, while babies children are even more helpless compared to Caucasian babies.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz2jjx_cross-cultural-differences-in-newborn-behavior_news#.UdaxKG3zNRY)

African children in the United States are systematically found to enter puberty at a much earlier age than white children. [Normal gestation length in black women is also a week shorter than in white women.](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1/107.full)

1371640789.0,1gndd7,Philosophical questions become trivial when dissected. CMV.,SoInsightful,44,9,58,"***Background***

I enjoy discussing philosophy

My philosophical viewpoint rests on two premises that to me seem uncontroversial *(Edit: their controversy status is not central here; think of them as one metatheory that can lead to answers)*:

- The human mind is an instinctive, subject to [hundreds of cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and prone to [hundreds of logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).

- Materialism is the default position until evidence of the contrary is shown.

---

***Categories of fallacious trivialities***

I contend that *philosophical questions in general* *(edit)* can be put into one or more of these five categories:

**1.1.** The concept is a humanly conceptualized [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory) without clearly definable boundaries. The question is as meaningful as ""at what shade does the color red cease to be red?""

**1.2.** The concept is an artifact of human intuition. Any reasoning will concern human subjectivity rather than the universe around us.

**1.3.** The question is merely a semantic dispute or a syntax error.

**2.** The question can easily be answered within materialistic (or otherwise Ockhamian) axioms. This does not denote absolute truth

**3.** The question is ill-suited for philosophy. No amount of purely philosophical reasoning can *(be verified to)* bring one closer to the truth. *(Edit: I've conceded that it might be an arbitrary category.)*

- Point out a considerable flaw somewhere in my reasoning.

- Convince me in a logical manner that my view of philosophy is misguided.

Please refrain from fallacies such as these:

- Appeal to authority: *""Do you seriously think you know better than centuries of professional philosophers?""* This is irrelevant to the veracity of the question.

It's a relaxing process. You're carefully tending a flame and it forces you to be mindful of your breathing. I think the chemicals are also relaxing but I'm no chemist. Taking a break to smoke forces you to stop and pause. It gives you a small moment to think whilst doing something methodical yet simple. You can clear your mind whilst packing a pipe

So why do I think it's worth the risk?

It's not that I don't think that there's a risk. The odds are high that something unhealthy will develop and it's probable that it'll be something really nasty. As for the risk to others

Why do I think it's cool?

It's that risk taking that's cool. It's cool to drive at 300mph everywhere if you never crash and never get caught. It's cool to do a backflip off a building if you can land it. And it's cool to do something life threatening casually

Even before we knew it was dangerous it was cool. The image of smoke curling through the air like a whisper-thin sheet of silk caught on an intangible breeze in front of a calm, masculinity and power. I don't know much about that sort of thing, but it meant that when a man smoked a cigarette, he was affirming his power and when women smoked cigarettes they challenged the idea of a male dominated society. So no matter who you were you were either cool because you were a powerful member of an influential group or a rebellious upstart looking for a revolution. Both are pretty cool.

Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the Indian independence movement and the Civil Rights movement and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activist. He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect ""oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'""

I have to agree with Peter's view.  

As for MLK and Gandhi, and military position after the second world war, India's size and population pools, and Soviet and Chinese ability to supply foreign revolutionaries (such as their involvement in Indochina), the U.K. would not have been able to prevent a violent Indian revolution. So while both of those movement were nonviolent, they were backed up with a serious threat of violence. Giving in before they became violent was the method chosen by politically smart Americans and British rather than the result of compassionate mind changing. 

This isn't an unpopular academic assessment.

Why not cut out the translation middle-man and get everyone on the same level?

3. It creates common ground. It's well known that language helps define how people think and, why not create a large language that allows for the expression of different ideals while narrowing the amount of separation between people? Why not make the various words overlap and, instead, focus on how they are used to create personal and societal identities?

This clearly fit the larger truth that racism and racial profiling is still a problem and whites are to blame. But then the truth came out - the man wasn't white - he was of mixed race with African, and Jewish heritage. The ""boy"" would be old enough to be tried as an adult for serious crimes. Moreover the gated neighborhood they lived in wasn't upper class and filled with blueblood white aristocrats as insinuated but rather a comically diverse middle class subdivision that had previous crime issues. Not to mention that the shooter was acting in self defense and had wounds and witnesses to corroborate his side of the story. The narrative failed yet liberals still are convinced that it was murder in order to play to the larger truth at hand rather than the actual truth that occurred.

To argue that we shouldn't be teaching women not to get raped is ludicrous! It is the responsibility of every able-bodied individual to defend themselves from any attack


I can assure you, and anyone who attacks another person outside of self defense is acting on motivation that can not be educated against.

It is wholly unpersuasive and works only to kill a discussion. Doing a job is not neutral; you represent your employer and function within a system to maintain that system. .

To clarify, the use of tear gas, tasers, or pepper spray. I’m talking about helpdesk employees whose job it is not to help people, but to make sure they hang up and don’t call back. Helpdesk employees are used solely to shield those responsible for the real operations from criticism and responsibility, and become part of a system which removes accountability by the set of instructions they are forced to follow. It has come to a point where, when an employee sees a legitimate problem

I’m not saying that all actions by employees are wrong. And I’m sorry I single out 2 professions, even when one is doing his or her job to the letter of the law and according to every policy guideline drawn up.

I have been convinced largely by the arguments proposed by the Australian bioethicist Peter Singer. Singer argues from a Utilitarian perspective that the total quality of life is increased when children with birth defects are euthanised after birth

Although I have no birth defects myself

Opponents of infant euthanasia generally argue that you should not decide on someone else's death, because although they want to die, humans carry inbuilt instincts that cause us to avoid self inflicted death.

Yesterday I witnessed a man attempt to kill himself by jumping in front of a train, with some apparently even photographing him and informing their friends and family members. In our present day society, it is quite clear that those who are born with defects are largely chained to life, and most have no way out other than mercy of nature.

Some of you might argue that governments should simply legalize voluntary euthanasia instead, many are likely burdened with a sense of guilt towards their family members, which would prevent them from pursuing euthanasia.

Many children born with birth defects end up abandoned by their parents, to children born with birth defects.

I do not know how relevant this is, and I believe our culture has an unhealthy fear of death, which people in more primitive cultures would interpret as being a form of cowardice.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fnj3q/i_believe_that_parents_should_be_allowed_a_30_day/
1369817779.0,1f9bqn,I think that many of the major pro-gun arguments are fallacious. CMV.,tigerhawkvok,54,21,174,"Yes

Point of clarification: I am almost always talking about semiautomatic and automatic weapons, still hunts/protects but isn't committing any crazy sprees and isn't sneaking up on someone. My view is currently most like ""Ban all firearms under 1m in length, and all those that are automatic or semiautomatic in nature"". However, that's not really the point of this CMV. So, the points - 

Here are a few that come to mind right now:

1) ""Why make them illegal when criminals will get them anyway""?
Why doesn't this exact same argument apply to:  
- Breaking and entering  
- Murder  
- Theft  
- Any patently antisocial activity  
I think that criminalizing all of those activities increase the barrier to entry, ""crime of passion"", and other non-violent-crime deaths. **EDIT: I happen to think that it probably will reduce violent crime, but we'd need to test it here, in the US, to see. I'm willing to ignore that and cede, in my mind


2) ""Giving X a gun lets them defend themself in case Y""  
I fail to see how knowledge of the defender owning a gun -- even having one on them -- doesn't just make the attacker add the sentence ""move toward your gun and I shoot"" and become and equivalent case to non-gun-ownership. An attacker, wielding, posture in and in a position of power to dictate terms of the interaction. They should always be able to pre-empt a situation like this. Why isn't this true? If you assume that the attacker does not possess a firearm, what makes that a reasonable assumption, especially given that some of the most pro-gun advocates advocate enforced carry? **EDIT: I forgot to ask about the comparison to non-lethal options. Stun guns, tasers, etc for people; bear mace, for aggressive wild animals**

3)  ""If people can't legally get guns and criminals illegally have it
Strawman! No one debates that. The point is that incidental deaths by legal firearms will be absent. It seems like every time the debate comes up

4) ""X kills more people annually than guns"".  
I have never seen an ""X"" that is not done VASTLY MORE than wielding a gun with safety off (eg, ready, gun ready compared to sitting in a car; yet, comparing gun deaths to automobile deaths always seems to come up. Why is this (very) common argument valid in the slightest? It really feels like comparing apples and chickens.  **EDIT: It was mentioned this is a worst-case. I would argue it isn't. Talking about the gun in a holster, or with the safety on, or in a drawer, is like talking about parked cars killing people, or death by alcohol in a sealed bottle before any has been taken (I hope everyone would agree that's absurd). *It isn't being used*. Hope that helps**

**EDIT:  
5) ""Guns are there to keep the government in check"".  
Really? Any amount of armament you have is going to keep an M1 Abrams at bay? An F22? A SWAT team? A CIA sniper? Please. If anyone really does believe that their personal firearm ownage -- and those of people they know -- are going to do a single thing against government military, oh boy please justify that. I mean, our populace isn't filled with Jason Bournes, James Bonds, etc.; that idea seems to me to be wishful thinking to live in an action movie as the hero. I thought that that was obvious but there was a comment on it.**

1368312483.0,1e5int,I don't believe any parent has any inherent right to raise their children. CMV,agoonforhire,43,7,59,"First submission.. not sure what to expect

There seems to be a ubiquitous assumption that parents have some sort of inherent right to raise their children as they see fit. 
Is there any logic at all behind this?

I don't see how the fact that a person has given birth (or got someone pregnant) somehow means they should be able to dictate how another person (their child -- a human being) must live their life. (from a moral point of view) 

When I hear people say, ""I know what's best for my child,"" it makes my blood boil. **You do not (necessarily) know what is best for your child.** (Further, if the people that I've heard saying this are any indication, I probably *do* know better.)

I am talking about parental rights across the board:

* Automatically being granted custody
* Teaching your kids your religion
* Choosing what video games (or tv shows or foods
* Making medical decisions
* etc

I don't see how the parent of a child has any more of a fundamental right to make these decisions for that child than anyone else does.

What I am **not** doing here:

* Trying to say anything about whether parents do or do not have any particular legal rights
* Proposing an alternative social structure that would reflect the fact that parents have no special rights
* Making any sort of argument about what is *practical*
* Asking why this assumption exists (whether or not it is right). This is obvious and does not warrant explanation.

I am talking only about whether or not parents *should have* any more of a right to the final say-so when it comes to their children than anyone else should.

(before you ask, but, this is about whether *parents* should have any special privilege in this regard.)

[Edit: I think that in an ideal world

[Edit2: The only argument I've heard so far that holds any real water (as best I can tell) is that biological parents are *can be expected* to have a strong natural drive to protect their biological children, is entirely a practical issue, and speaks nothing of whether it is right in principle.

I think it's wrong to shoot someone, but I feel that (for instance) a teenager playing getting a thrill out of breaking into someone's house just for kicks shouldn't be shot and possibly killed for their stupidity.  In cases where the trespasser does demonstrate a threat (carrying a gun, running at you with a knife, etc), then JUSTIFIABLE FORCE should be considered legal. However, shooting someone who doesn't demonstrate a threat just because they're in your home?  That should be attempted murder or manslaughter (depending on the outcome).
