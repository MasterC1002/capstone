I started commuting in January to school (10 mi Round Trip) and since riding to school,500 miles since I picked up my bike in January/710 miles since I picked up an odometer in August) and I absolutely love it. 

I'm not going to lie, I can't imagine why I did. It's so awesome to have the wind blowing in my face, getting to school and knowing I have helped do my part in lowering gas prices for everyone else (my car is a 4.7L Jeep, last time I went to a gas station must have been in July), as well as helping free up parking for everyone else who HAS to commute by car. 

It really hit me today as my young, and to me, it is absolutely senseless to actually start up a car, drive the quarter mile to the grocery store to pick up something that could very easily be carried in a backpack. 

But to all of you, and the environment. Not to mention, there is some sort of camaraderie in commuting by bike that I have come to notice.

 For instance, but in this situation I stop, of course. As soon as I come to a stop, the driver will give me the wave. I appreciate the act of kindness, but it's really confusing if you're not looking at the driver and just waiting for them to go. The same thing happens at two way stops, where I have to stop and they don't. That's when it becomes frustrating, because I'm trying to figure out what the hell they're doing. Again, but it's confusing. 

Finally, maybe ten seconds. People will appear to go, but pull out into the intersection. Sometimes I'll give them the wave, since they have more than enough time, but usually they just keep waiting.

Well, I had to figure out how to get to and from work. Well, my landlord let me borrow his bike and when he doesn't drive me, I would ride to and fro work.

The transition was terrible. My work is about 3.5 miles away with alot of hills and the first day that I had to ride to work I stopped to walk so many times it was embarrassing. Yeah, I slowly noticed as my endurance went up and my legs strengthened and quit yelling at me to stop. It went from me stopping at random moments, to me stopping only at hills, then this week, me riding the whole way through in 20-25 minutes. I'm sure I can do it under that time but the lights, traffic, and sidewalks all seem to be conspiring against me. 

I'm just amazed at all you people riding 10+ miles commutes in record times and that's pure commitment in my eyes. Cycling is definitely a big deal and its so rewarding when you feel your body getting stronger throughout the weeks. When I get back to school, so I won't lose all my progress.

Its actually my moms bike that I procured this last weekend. I'm 6'3"" and 290 lbs so I am riding in to improve over all health. Saving a few dollars in gas will be nice as well.

I put some specialized road tires on it Friday night.  I did a test run on Saturday morning and it went pretty good.  I live 13 miles from the office and drove to the midway point and cycled in from there.  My calves were sore as well as my back but I ought to get used to that.

I did the same 6 mile ride in this morning only to pop a tire about 4 blocks short.  At least that is where I realized it was flat.  I plan to drive to the halfway point for a couple weeks while I get used to riding the bike in. There is a cool mini bike shop [BTC](http://bicycletransitcenter.com/) that I was headed to that has showers and lockers for $12 a month.  My office is only 2 blocks from the shop so its really convenient.

I have to head back over at lunch to fix my tire so it will be ready for the ride home.  I know the bike isn't much but I wanted to ride in for a while before I spend $$$ on a bike to make sure I will do it. The bike needs some work and a general tune up pretty bad but it manages until I can get that done.

EDIT:  Today (6/20) I did the whole ride in from my house to the office.  Per the strava app it ended up being 12.3 miles,,False,self,t5_2tbmq,1371743284.0,,True

I decided I would start looking into how to get rid of/sell my car. I paid my sister 5 years ago for her car. We never transferred the title

As I started asking my sister to help me transfer the title, and how I would ever be able to get to family events. After much back and forth and absolutely no understanding on her end, here is a snippet from a very long email that I now refer to as the ""Pontius pilate"" response:

""Long story short - I'm willing to transfer the title to you, and you have to suffer with the consequences.  Not me.  Absolutely 100% do not count on me when you can't reserve your ""car-ride share"" to get you somewhere that your bike can't.""

My mother also thinks that I'm doing this as a way to distance myself from the family. The thing is, I would never miss a birthday, anniversary, wedding, or reunion. I even got a Zip car membership so I can drive 45 minutes back home if I ever needed to, just to appease my family. I even did this before they began voicing their disapproval/concerns.

I feel like I've tried telling them everything and they still don't understand or approve. Does anyone have anything I could say that would make them understand?

I've changed dozens of mountain bike tires in my life so I didn't really think it would be any different than a road bike.  I kept making stupid mistakes though.

It happened about a mile away from work.  I could have walked the rest of the way in about the same time it took me to fix it and ride the rest of the way.  But I decided to go ahead and put my spare on.

When I bought my bike I knew nothing about road bikes.  So I just told the guy at the bike store my budget and had them set me up.  Fortunately he knew what he was doing and got me a spare tube, but I may get an air pump instead of replacing the cartridge.

My other tube might be fine

It took me about 20 minutes to do it.  Kept changing how I was trying to get the tire back on.  When I finally figured out the 'smart' way it only took 3 or so minutes to finish up.

I hear people ask rain gear questions all of the time and bike-specific gear is great at what it does

-Step 1: [2 plastic grocery bags and 2 velcro straps](http://i.imgur.com/g5XtxDh.jpg)


-Step 2: Put each foot in each bag. 

-Step 3: [Once feet are in the bags ""roll"" the top over your foot

-Step 4: [Hold a finger to the top of the bag on your foot and secure the velcro around your arch.  Done!](http://i.imgur.com/vUG9l6A.jpg)

If you have full cover fenders this works gloriously.  I currently run race-blade fenders which really don't protect the feet and have yet to have a soaked foot with this method in snow conditions.  In most rain conditions they have worked perfectly well

There you go.  Easy, but they do not tend to last many rides and when they do fail the whole thing comes apart (not fun in the middle of a ride).  The velcro is much more reliable.

Keep riding!

I'm hoping you can give me some wisdom and help here. 

I ride to work, its become harder for me to find a parking spot than a place to park my bike. 

There are no racks, but whatever). I had been parking my bike on a railing by a garden, I would lift my bike over the plants to avoid damaging them. This railing is on the side of a bank in the lot, I've made friends with their parking enforcer and she had been keeping an eye on my bike. Recently I noticed the sprinkler was gushing water out (at 4am when I arrive), so I reported it to the manager at the bank. Next thing I know the manager has informed the parking enforcer that I can no longer park my bike by the railing because I probably broke the sprinkler. So now, I have nowhere to park my bike. My manager keeps suggesting some dinky  trees, but I live in LA where several trees have been cut down to steal bikes. According to my manager the facilites manager cannot install a bike rack anywhere, this situation is escalating to ridiculous levels and I just want a damn pole to park my bike safely!

Are there any laws on my side? Do you have any suggestions? 

My current plan is to contact the facilities manager and kindly explain that I was the one that reported the sprinkler and I'm positive it was not me who broke it. ",self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/19qqoi/of_all_the_issues_that_arise_from_biking_to_work/

I was in the process of changing my stock Cross Check, anyone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/11b2fb/city_bikes_anyone/)"" thread popped up. Since then I've mostly finished the CC and have been using it on my daily commute. 


 

**Drive Train**

The biggest change was changing the drive train to an IGH 8 speed Shimano Alfine hub. I really like it--it's incredibly smooth. Those of you who have ridden a fixed gear or single speed would find this pretty similar

**Bar Setup**

The next major change in the bike was the handlebar setup. Switching to [Civia Dupont](http://www.civiacycles.com/components/dupont_handlebar/) bars took this from a cross/road bike to a real townie feel. So far I love the upright riding position and I don't feel slower on this bike for normal riding. I can't do an all-out sprint and get into the drops like I could before

**Grips and Shifter**

I wanted this bike to look good as well as be functional, but it's definitely worth it. 

*Note about the shifter:* Jtek only has black listed on their site

**Fenders and Rack**

[Velo Orange Steel Fenders](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/accessories/fenders/fender-sets/vo-45mm-stainless-fenders-700c.html) - $55 for steel fenders is very reasonable

[Dajia Steel Rack](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/dajia-stainless-steel-rear-expedition-rack.html) - Awesome rack and really good price for a good looking steel rack. I looked at Tubus and Nitto but couldn't justify their prices. 

**Misc**

I also put a [chain guard](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/accessories/chainguards-stay-protectors-kickstands/vo-alloy-chainguard.html) (also VO) on there partially for looks

I'm running [All City 612 Cranks](http://allcitycycles.com/products/612_track_cranks) with [Crank Brothers Mallet2 Pedals](http://www.crankbrothers.com/pedals_mallet2.php).

**Thoughts**

I love it! I'll probably put a front basket style rack on this bike pretty soon

Two blocks later a bus hit me while it was turning. Classic mistake.  Bus was making a right turn into me. 

It sends me off balance and in my panic I couldn't unclip! I fell over on the ground and the bus just continued to run over my bike.  I was still clipped in! It ran over the back of my bike and crushed my rear fender and rack. It never stopped. Just kept going. 

I'm not scared of riding or anything. Though it was scary.  I feel like i just need some advice about bike shoes and pedals.

That said

I had a road bike already but didn't want to lock it on the sidewalk and leave it all day, all that beginner stuff. I've had a couple flat tires that punched right through the tire, so over the months I've needed to buy new tires (finally invested in some Hard Cases, so hopefully that will stop). And of course, once I started biking I wanted better gear... I got an Osprey Momentum backpack for Christmas (which was great because that would've cost me quite a bit on my own) and bought fenders for the road bike.

Anyway, etc. **I would've spent $560 on public transportation passes** in that same time period. The thing is, though, that I still have to ride public transport sometimes, which I pay for per ride, so I'm probably just barely breaking even. I thought it was interesting and a little surprising to calculate what I've actually spent on this little hobby so far.

A couple caveats: As I said above, and sometimes if I'm bringing my wheel in to get a new tire, I'll just pay to have the bike shop guys install it rather than doing it myself. And a lot of the stuff I've bought - U-lock, fenders for the road bike, etc. - is a one-time purchase that I can hopefully use for years, so my future costs will hopefully go down.

I'm just curious what the experience of other bike commuters has been. Does biking to work save you money? Was that even your motivation in the first place?

**Edit: To clarify, not because I'm worried about it.**

I commute on a full suspension mountain bike with semi-slick tires.  I enjoy jumping over curbs and medians like a lunatic. When I ride trails on the weekends I switch the tires out for knobby ones (or just ride the slicks hah).

So here's my wishlist in order of importance:

-Waterproof top and bottom.  I liked the looks of the timbuk 2 swig but I do not believe the bottom is waterproof only the flap that goes over the top.

-Lightweight

-Good Ventilation

-No hip belt or at least removable / hide-able hip belt  Yes I'm sure they are amazingly useful but they really bother me.  Sometimes I wear a motocross chest protector when I ride and having that thing getting pushed up by a hip belt is a real pain.  Maybe I can just tie the hip straps up with wire ties or something.

[**Chain Lube**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015FI8AS/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Just spray it on while rotating gears backwards (or forwards if you have it upside or on a stand w/e).  This is the single most effective DIY maintenance product I have bought. I can't hear my bike at all when I ride. It's definitely worth it!


[**Silk Glove Liners**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5DB1E/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - When your gloves won't cut it

[**This is some heavy duty chain/lock**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTPO2M/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)  I don't use this often but it's a solid lock. 

[**Kickstand**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NDYOK/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - I got this since my bike didn't come with one. It was a little annoying to put on, that's all that I care about.

[**Blinking red-light thingy**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RYAKHC/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Batteries last long. I have it clipped to my backpack.

[**U-Lock and cable**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C94T84/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - A bit more expensive, they'll say U-Locks. They restrict leverage, and usually have an anti-drill mechanism built-in the keyhole.

[**Padded under-shorts**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QYXAVE/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Protect that grundle! Although

[**Rain boot covers**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171KGEG/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - For those summer days of 90 degrees and rain

[**Velcro Reflectors**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6D5XW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Be seen at night and keep pants from getting gear/chain crap on them.

I have zero brand loyalty and truth be told, just like professional swimmers shave their body hair for fractional gains, but would a fat guy like me even notice a difference between an $800 bike and a $4000 bike?

(X-post /r/bicycling),ZanzaraEE,19,4,7,"I'd would like to speak out against motorists wrongfully yielding right-of-way to cyclists when the cyclists are proceeding straight across a busy road. [IMAGE](http://i.imgur.com/HyiqE.jpg). This often leads to an ""annoying situation"" that I have described below. I also have described two ""dangerous situations"" that I have been a part of as a result of this wrongful yielding.

**Annoying situation**

Again

Anyway. Sometimes when the cyclist is waiting for a safe time to proceed

Why? As a cyclist, the motorist in lane 2 causes a long delay for themselves, the cars behind them, and the cars in lanes 3 and 4. It always seems like less of a delay would have occurred for everyone (on average) had no one wrongfully yielded to me.

**Dangerous situation 1**

Once I was in a situation as follows: a car stopped for me in lane 1. I saw a car coming from behind it in lane 2, but had I proceeded, I would be in danger of being hit. (Side note, it is heavily emphasized in drivers' ed courses to never pass a car stopped at a crosswalk until you know why they are stopped.)

**Dangerous situation 2**

A car in lane 2 wrongfully yielded; this car was going straight. Also, making the situation even more awkward). I started proceeding across the intersection. Along the way I had to stop as a bus was heading through the intersection in lane 4. I'm not sure if the bus driver saw me over top of the car in lane 3 (it was a pickup truck), so had I not stopped, I would have been in danger of being struck by that bus. I think the bus driver could see only that the person in lane 3 was turning left, not that they were (wrongly) yielding to a cyclist.

**In conclusion

* **My hints for cyclists:** Be very careful when a car wrongfully yields to you.

* **My hints for motorists:** Do not wrongfully yield to a cyclist to be polite

PS: To the motorists who do stop wrongfully: Thanks for watching out for cyclists and being polite

My commute 17 miles each way but completely on bike trails

I currently have two bikes: my dad's rather old Trek Mountain bike which I haven't ridden in close to 3 years- mostly because it weighs a ton and I have a better bike to ride. I also have a Trek Madone 2.1 road bike that I ride on weekends.

I know there are bike locks in the garage at work, reliable bike for commuting (and probably some grocery shopping too). I also want the bike to withstand rain and snow so I can bike in all-seasons. I once got caught on an unmelted snowy path on my road bike and it didn't end well.

As my commute is long, etc) I'm not sure the road bike would suffice (can you even fit a rack and fenders on a road bike?), and I have a feeling the mountain bike would be unbearable on a ride that long with the weight on the back-end. I once had a rack and panniers on my bike and it was borderline un-liftable.

Any suggestions on bikes? Should I try out the mountain or the road bike for a while? If so- what should I do to make them commutable? I don't want to spend $1, and I definitely want clipless pedals for the ride. 

I've never commuted to work before so I've basically got no idea what I'm doing- please help!

So you have to negotiate traffic on the current road that's going anywhere between 50-65mph and traffic coming off the freeway itself at the same speeds.  Actually the whole road seems ridiculously dangerous as you basically only have a few feet and a white line separating you and traffic rumbling along at near 70mph... but that's not the point of this post.

I'm most interested in:

-How long your commute is

-What the terrain's like

-What traffic conditions are like

-Any other uses you have for the bike in question



Your setup:

-Type of handle bars

-Type of pedals

-Kind of gearing 



The bicycling population on here seems pretty diverse in terms of their location throughout the US (and the world). I think it'd be interesting to see how this relates to the type of bike they ride.












EDIT: Thanks for the input guys

*Distance*

30 miles: 1

25 miles: 1

20 miles: 4

15 miles: 4

10 miles: 3

5 miles: 3


*Handlebar Position*

Dropped: 8

Upright: 9


Dropped handlebars are those that extend below the handle bar stem. Upright is everything at and above.

1. Are entitled to share the road with motor vehicles.
2. Have the same rights and responsibilities as vehicle and motorcycle drivers.
3. Shall ride as near to the right curb or edge of the roadway as practical– not on the sidewalk.
4. Are legally allowed to ride in the center of the lane when moving at the same speed as other traffic.

If I understand correctly we are entitled to be on the road with motor vehicles AND we have the same “rights and responsibilities as vehicles and motorcycle drivers.” By this I understand that I have the right to take my position in the lane and ride comfortably and safely. 

The second two are the ones that are confusing and contradicting to me. If I have to ride as close to the right curb or on the edge then I effectively lose my same “rights” as a vehicle. It does mention “as practical” but that seems to be a subjective perspective to me. Also the according to last law, or slower marked roads). 

So what is it? Are we legally allowed to take the lane or aren’t’ we? Do we have the same rights and responsibilities as a vehicle or don’t we?

--

Personally

I do my best to stay out of the way when riding on a very busy street. I take the far right lane and allow cars to pass me on the left lane. If I’m on a one-lane street and cars are behind me I try to move over and give them space to pass. As much as I expect them to share the road with me and make me feel safe

Anyway

Thanks!

I have a 2009 Novara that I use for daily commuting and all around riding. I put anywhere from 50-100 miles per week on it. I live in a large city (Dallas) and ride on the road majority of the time. I do have to ride through construction zones, and other things that can maul tubes but luckily I have had only 1 or 2 flats in the past year. I have been riding on Vittoria Randonneurs (30 tpi version, wire bead) since I got the bike a little over a year ago (bought used). Honestly, the tires themselves aren't bad in any way but I've heard nothing but glowing reviews of the Schwalbe and Continentals. I want something with a little more feel to it so a higher tpi is definitely a possibility. I also really like the reflective stripe on my sidewall. Basically, I'm looking for a decently long lasting tire that has some more feel to it while also being puncture resistant and having a reflective stripe on the sidewall. I'm currently on 700x32s and enjoy the cushiness so I want to stay with the same size. I'm stuck between getting another pair of the Randos or Rando Pros, Conti Touring Plus, Conti Contacts, feel free to list that as well.

**TL;DR** - Vittoria Randonneur, Continental Contacts, or Schwalbe Marathons for urban commuting in a 700x32 size? Reflective sidewall is a must.

Over that time I've replaced a number of components that have proven to suck (the adjustable stem that wouldn't stay adjusted, I heard a strange noise as I was cranking away and then the back wheel fell out of the frame. It turned out I'd sheared the axel. Crazy

I'm 6'5"", but I've only used it sparingly.

I've checked out a few LBS and while they are all happy to order something for me, raleigh, etc). I also have searched craigslist and ebay but have had the same problem with finding large enough frames. Bikesdirect has three options with 64cm frames that look appealing to me for various reasons, and I was hoping the knowledgable folk here might have good insights that I'm lacking. I was hoping to spend around $500, but that might not be possible (and all 3 options are $6-700).

1. Motobecane Cafe Noir: http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/cafe_noir.htm
It's got a steel frame and 105 components (which I understand are good). It also has an adjustable stem, but I'm somewhat curious what riding with a more agressive stance would be like. Can't find any reviews.


2. Motorbecane Fantom CX: http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/fantom_cross_cx3.htm
It's got an aluminum frame and steel fork. I think I might need to replace the tires for road riding? Seems to have decent reviews.


3. Windsor Tourist: http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/windsor/tourist.htm
It's steel


So are all of these viable options? Do they suck? Anything else I should consider?

I'm new to commuting and cycling (with any seriousness) in general.  Not too long ago, and a &gt;=20 miles ride on the weekend usually (longer each week as I've gotten more comfortable).

Through the past month or so, and I see myself getting involved with group rides and charity rides and what not moving forward.

I have my list of bikes narrowed down to about 3 (5 on the list, but there is a reason it's my third choice (price point with respect to components).  For the same price, my number 1 choice would have better components almost all around.  The difference in cost of those components purchased separately would be hundreds of dollars.  So I'd be sacrificing that upside for the sake of having rack mounts pretty much and no cost savings.

Being new to using a bike to commute, but I've just used a back pack for that so far.  It's not ideal, but it's worked out fine.

Is there anything I'm not thinking about?

My question is, or at least dampen some road vibration at good speeds.

I already owned SPD compatible shoes because I switched to shoes with a stiff sole of my 9.5 mile

This year I picked up [Shimano Click'R](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VQCYOK/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) pedals

My original strategy was to wait till the weekend and then go for a leisure ride while the wife was home so I could call her up if I found the pedals unmanageable or took a spill.   Once I managed to break the old pedals loose (what at PITA that was) I abandoned that plan and decided to give them a shot on my commute.  

Of course, which was the one place where I almost tipped over.  I hit a soft patch of grass and came to a near stop and while trying to balance, accidentally clipped back in as I started to topple.  I managed to pop out again before I overbalanced.

All in all

I also need to figure out a process for adjusting the position of the cleats.  My left foot needs to have the heel moved out a half inch and the right foot is too far forward a bit.  I've done the 'clip in, clip in' several times and it just seems like I keep missing the mark one way or another.  

TL;DR - installed clipless, need to figure out how to adjust the cleats.  Brats are good.  Free ones are better.

**Commute details:**
* 8.7 km (5.4 mi) with about 100 m (330 ft.) of climb
* No real heavy traffic.  The climb is up a bypass road that only has light traffic

I'm looking at one of these two:

* [Giant Defy 3](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-ca/bikes/model/defy.3/12294/58203/)

* [Specialized Secteur Compact](http://www.specialized.com/ca/en/bikes/road/secteur/secteurcompact)

The two bike shops in town (and within a 1500 km radius) carry:

* Giant

* Kona

* Specialized

* Rocky Mountain


I'd be open to an entry/intro road bike with rack mounts from any of those brands.  I know that the shops carry the Defy and the Secteur so I can get on them and try them out.  I'm kind of weird shaped, currently 210 lbs).  I don't know what that means, geometry wise, but I'm sure it will come into play somewhere in whole fitting process.

I've never ridden a road bike

I'm not sure what the difference is (if any) between those two bikes.  I might be willing to bump up one ""trim"" level (pardon my ignorance) to get the ""zerts"" in the specialized frame (and if its worth it, but honestly I don't know what they are.  Are there any glaring differences between the two?  One thing I noticed is that the Giant comes with brake levers on both the drop and the horizontal part of the handlebar, while the Specialized only has levers on the drop part of the bar.  I like the idea of levers on the horizontal part of the bar, as it offers another riding position.  

Internet reviews are good for both

Obviously I'm going to try them out as best I can before dropping $1

I've looked at pure commuters

tl;dr please give me some advice about entry level road bikes to be used as a commuter.

**EDIT**
Thanks for all the help!  I'm leaning towards the Giant but I want to ride both of them to see.  I may even be able to squirrel away enough money to go up one level in either (the Defy 2 or the Secteur Compact Sport) but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

Its worked well for me over the last month or so and I am getting stronger and faster.  My commute is about 12 miles each way and is in all practical purposes flat.

I never use the two smaller cogs upfront (total noob and unfamiliar with the lingo) and am interested in seeing what it would take ($) to get something with a higher gear ratio.

I know that I need to replace the whole crank set as only the granny gear is replaceable but don't know what to look for after that.  I have tried to google this but what I find is pretty low or high level

How do I figure out what gearing I have on my current chainring (?) so that I can swap it for a higher geared one.  Is it a matter of measuring circumference and going bigger or harder than that?

I would also love suggestions for this swap.  I want to keep price low since this is a pretty old bike as it is and am still considering  replacing it with a newer bike. I don't think that I'm interested in converting it to a single speed at this time but may consider going to a 2x or perhaps even a 1x setup.  I do use the other gears on the biggest chainring still.

I (along with a few others in my organization) have to regularly travel ~50km, and I've recently started cycling instead of driving. I'm trying to get a formal policy in place for compensation.

Since clocking hours for it would simply be too much, this generally just goes toward fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc. My proposal is that instead of that money going toward fossil fuel industries, it goes straight to the rider to compensate for their time (and the wear and tear). Meals can be compensated separately, and that is no problem.

This gives a flat incentive to each employee (why should the ED be paid more than me to cycle?) and also incentivizes general fitness. For example, that works out to about $8/hour. If I improve my fitness, I could likely soon do it in 4 hours, working out to $10/hour, and so on.

I was legally taking the lane on a busy street. This particular street connects to a major highway and it just so happens that you  have to turn right to get onto it. The far lane I was in is quite wide, so now I usually try to stay in the middle of the lane so that drivers don't have a chance to pass me on the right, because I find it particularly scary when they do that. Anyway one driver starts honking at me. I reach a red light by the onramp and stop. The driver proceeds to roll down his window and insult me loudly. My Latin/Italian/German mix kicks in and I slur some loud quite rude insults right back at him. He gives  up and continues his way onto the highway. The driver behind him pulls down his window and just shakes his head at me disapprovingly. I of course, all riled up insult him as well. 

As I drove away

I'm fairly new at biking and I know I'm going to encounter drivers like this a lot and I need to learn to handle it in a less stressful way for me. I don't want biking/commuting to become an absolutely unpleasant thing to do for me.

The end. 

UPDATE: 

So after much debate I decided to take a different route. I was uneasy about it at first because I'm new to town and I don't know my way around very well. So I had to take an extra 30 minutes to stop and go while checking directions. But it was so worth it! I've only taken the alternate route a couple of times but it is much more enjoyable.

I've recently been traveling to Berlin and have been blown away by the European biking culture. There is ample parking everywhere, which is just plain awesome and safer!

In relation to park biking. Is there something that can be done about this? I've thought about it and wondered why we don't see community supported bike parking. Fine

For example, the Bedford stop is litered with bikes, which take up the side walk and have a habit og being stolen. What if there was a bike storage place near by? Such that someone could key in, for security, and lock their bock to the wall. I see that some [companies](http://www.saris.com/commercial-parking/creating-your-space-/indoor-parking-planning.html) actually help with bike parking planning.

I'm not interested in going particularly fast. I've stayed on the 42T sprocket the entire time so far.

I was thinking of something like this: http://www.sram.com/sram/road/products/sram-apex-crankset#/path/term-id/254

So should I

* Stop being a wimp
* Lose some weight (the body fat kind
* Go to the LBS and look into getting a smaller crankset
* Look into clipless pedals

Will my bike support a change like this?
When I get in better shape will I be flying up this hill without breaking a sweat on my current gearing.
Am I speaking reasonable bike-speak yet or is my wording a little off?

Hello

I'm a casual commuter who just moved to Pittsburgh, so I never moved move my bike to the city with me. 

On Tuesday of last week, then realized that both my headlight and tail light had fallen/broken off during the journey to Pittsburgh. So Thursday after class, I bussed it to REI, purchased some new lights, dealt with a bunch of other unrelated BS before I got back to the place I was subletting. I got in, sat down for 20 minutes, changed, installed my new lights

As this was only my 4th or 5th time descending these steps, and when one wasn't there, I landed very strangely and rolled my ankle outwards. I tried to catch myself with my left leg and rolled that one, as well. I knew I heard a ""pop"" as I went down and was shaking with anticipation of feeling a bone sticking out. Thankfully, there was none. But, I felt that my right leg had dislocated forward off of my ankle. In that moment of fear/adrenaline/shock, I just squeezed and felt it move back into place. I felt somewhat relieved, I pushed up with my arms to try to scoot myself backwards up on to the steps. When I started lifting my leg

After many hours of sitting and waiting, Friday morning by this point, I was taken to the OR and had a plate and screws put in to stabilize the fracture and some work done to my tendons as well, apparently. I was out of it almost all the rest of Friday, spent all of Saturday and half of Sunday recovering at the hospital. 

All this over one step. *One. Single. Step.* Now, but it could have just as easily been that much worse.



***TLDR: Carrying my bike down unfamiliar steps

&gt;Hey cool customer service person reading this

&gt;can you find out for me if your company has any plans to ever release a bicycle commuter line of clothing? Or just to market to commuters? It's probably a silly idea (though Levi has done it as you know) but as someone who bikes and who prefers to dress for the destination rather than the ride it would be really meaningful to have a company like Gap Inc. recognizing the potential of this. As it stands now there's so much money to be made in the lycra and gortex trade that I can't believe for a second that you not thought about usurping these sport companies and try to put everyday riders in your jeans and khakis


&gt;Also


&gt;More people on bikes


&gt;Be the change

Alright, dressing for the destination is a real option and it'd be nice to have some companies more ""out there"" with their bike commuting love (and love is what it's all about) :) 

Let me know what you think

I need some advice on urban style (hybrid) bikes. The main two bikes I'm interested in are: Cannondale BadBoy 5 or 9 and Scott Sub 10 or 20. I name them for those of you that have ridden or own the bikes. 


My current bike is a CAAD10 that I bought last year and I absolutely love. However
The questions I have are:


1. Will I really notice the weight increase on a very flat 7mile commute (one-way)?


2. Other than road/paved trails what type of terrain can these bikes handle stock setup? For instance the GF and I love to camp, derailer issues, poor traction etc?


3. Lastly, Indy to BroadRipple area for those familiar.
