Essentially slacklining is balancing on a 1"" piece of nylon webbing that is tensioned between two points. Slacklines are generally a few feet off the ground between two trees but my favorite aspect of slacklining is highlining.

Highlining is just slacklining.... up high(not while high). Most highlines are above 50' I consider it a highline if you fall it's a sure death. However you are of course tied off to the line and highline rigs are very complicated and very safe if done right.

Another popular part of slacklining is tricklining which is the most common part of slacklining. The lines are low to the ground and generally much tighter to give you more bounce. The tricks vary greatly from balance yogaesque moves to aerial flips/tricks whatever you can think of really.


Here are some pictures of a few of the lines I've walked

1297259778.0,fi082,I need to shift some t-shirts and I'm offering them to Reddit at what ever price they feel they are worth.,albannach,32,7,17,"This is a cross post from r/favors but thought I'd stick it in here to as I guess it also counts as a shameless plug.

Basically

The shop is here: http://toughlove.bigcartel.com/

There are 4 t-shirt designs that come in black or white. They are currently priced at £12.99 (roughly $20) with free shipping. For reddit I am offering discount codes so that you decide what you'd like to pay. The codes are tiered and allow you up to 70% off (I can't offer them completely free

So

* REDDIT10 - 10% off
* REDDIT20 - 20% off
* REDDIT30 - 30% off
* REDDIT40 - 40% off
* ~~REDDIT50 - 50% off~~
* ~~REDDIT60 - 60% off~~
* ~~REDDIT70 - 70% off~~

EDIT: Thanks those that have bought t-shirts so far! Unfortunately too many have opted for the 70% off code and I can't afford to sell anymore at that price as it works out at a loss. 50% breaks me even :).

1295552998.0,f5zv7,I will do a digital painting for you for $25.,cabbages,31,4,9,"Yesterday I saw a post where EnglishTraitor was doing some wicked portraits of Redditors in charcoal and chalk for $25. I thought maybe I could get in on the action.

I propose something a little bit different. 

$25 gets you a digital painting with one subject and a simple background. The subject can be you, significant other, child, cat, dog, parakeet, favorite shoe, cliché bowl of fruit

If you want multiple subjects, then it will cost extra, but we can negotiate the price.

I will send you the .pdf (Photoshop file) and a .jpg (or any other format of your choice) at a resolution of 2500 x 3500. This should print nicely to most standard frame sizes. It's up to you what you want to do with it. Have it printed at your local CVS

Here's some (kind of unfinished) examples of what I do:

[Tegan and Sara](http://i.imgur.com/1AcX7.jpg)

[Casablanca](http://i.imgur.com/oeylC.jpg)

[Kitty cat](http://i.imgur.com/KNFFH.jpg)

If you're interested, I will send you a PayPal invoice. Once I finish, I'll send the file. If some shenanigans go down, and I happen to lose my right hand in a tragic woodchipper accident, you will get a refund.

I'm in a spot and need some cash

That was nearly 16 years ago to the day

Project Trace Japan is a documentary I'm developing that will take 2 years to film and will span over a hundred hours. It will be made and broadcast specifically for the internet

The videos will be around ten minutes in length each. They will be uploaded five days a week

In addition to simply walking around and recording sights I will also be delving into the day to day lives of citizens. One day I might be perusing the Tsukiji seafood market

I've spent over a year budgeting and planning for the trip, but I'm still way shy of the money I'll need. I setup a donation page which I've linked at the bottom of this post for anyone who has a few dollars they can part with. Including my savings and assets I'm only 1/7th of the way there, so it will be years before I can start filming without outside assistance.

Making this documentary is my dream, an upvote or a few words of encouragement will always be appreciated. Dreams don't just come true, they're something we make happen, and I intend to fight for my dream until it sees fruition. 

Project Trace Japan is what I want to say late in my life was the thing I gave to this world. With that said, and never give up on your dreams.

[Donations can be made here.](https://www.wepay.com/donations/internet-documentary-series-about-life-in-japan)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT 1/22/12**

ExplainingmyDownvote has given me the indication I should better elaborate the details of this project. Trace Japan is something I've been wanting to film for about 7 years now. It's not just an excuse to get out and see a new place, who wouldn't? Then again, only a handful of people ever went out on an expedition without wanting to see someplace new. No one's got a rifle to my head sending me to claim anything in the name of some queen. I'm doing this of my own free will, because I want to.

I'll admit making a documentary isn't the most original idea, this is heavy equipment I'll be lugging around. Right now the gear I'm currently set on weighs in the neighborhood of 80lbs. I'll be carrying it everywhere so that's about 12 hours a day I'll spend hauling it from place to place. I'll have the tripod setup when I'm shooting, but that's still a lot of damn work. I'm not just walking around Tokyo, my goal is to see every city and town in the entire country.

Editing and recording a narration will be a lot of fun too. On my ""days off"" I'll be running through five days worth of raw footage, and recording a narrative to package it all up with. I won't have a lot of free time to say the least, not if I want the level of quality I'm aiming for.

Also, shooting, editing, and of coarse getting it all published online. I'm not going to be riding in cars and jets, I'll be taking trains and walking over most of the country. With the budget I've drawn up I can only afford to maintain a small studio apartment and will rarely be able to justify a hotel room when I'm too far away to get home at night. Some days I'll be walking around until dawn getting ready for another day of shooting. It's not like I'll have a steady stream of revenue or the ability to request additional funds, what I have in pocket has to last 2 years in a place with a relatively high cost of living.

It's a lot more work than most people would want to believe, but it's a dream I've had since I was 18 so I'm willing to sacrifice my current stability and security to do it. Not enough people accomplish their dreams, there just isn't much time to set aside with the responsibilities of family and maintaining our own livelihood. I've got no one left to be responsible for except myself, so I have a rare opportunity most will never get. I intend to make the most of it, no matter how long it takes.

Trace Japan is going to be made in my lifetime, will help me bring it to life. Please give what you can, I am grateful for any help that is offered. Rest assured, this is something I will put my whole heart into making.",,False,self,True,t3_or0bq

If you're like me, you bookmark the page about it to check/buy/download it later.

You end up with thousands of bookmarks that you ultimately forget about.

Well now you can just create a list of those things to have them all in one page and perform quick actions on them.

Here are some examples:

* You read a thread on reddit about how Battle: Los Angeles is going to be awesome. Well, [tho.se](http://tho.se) finds the movie, and gives you customized buttons to watch the trailer on Youtube, buy it on Amazon, do whatever you want to do with it on Isohunt, and/or get the subtitles from OpenSubtitles. It also generates a random URL à-la tinyurl (shortlink) that [you can share with your friends](http://tho.se/.reddit).

* You are in a band. You do covers. Now you can add all the songs you cover to a list, read the tab on UltimateGuitar and so on, for each song. A random URL is created that you can share with the other members of the band. You can also add a password that you may share with your friends if you want them to be able to add songs to the list in the future.

* You want to make a wishlist for christmas. Just add your items to the list

Of course you may want to edit the list later. You just have to add a password that you'll have to type everytime you want to edit it. When you enter the right password

The last feature is a bit more meta, anything that starts with *http://*. If the address points to anything that [tho.se](http://tho.se) can read, it will display a small capture of the page. Still, if you're going to link a movie, book or music, you should look for the title instead.

[Here's the link to the book.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TPZ7XO/)

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:

So who am I and why should you care? I'll copy and paste a VERY brief summary which I used to enter the contest:

""I am proud to introduce you to my son, or eat, but he CAN smile and laugh. Most importantly, Isaac can love and he can feel when somebody loves him.

We are a family of 5 living on a single income with our oldest daughter leaving for college in the fall of 2012. Due to Isaac’s medical needs, it is becoming more and more obvious that it will not be long before we simply will not be able to get him in and out of a typical vehicle. Even today, I struggle to move him and position him in and out of our car. We are reaching a point where we either must find suitable transportation for Isaac or make him a prisoner in his own home. Staying at home simply is not an option for many reasons. First, his medical team is at AI Dupont Hospital in Wilmington, DE which is over 100 miles away and without these amazing people, I couldn't imagine where we would be today. Second, Isaac needs to have some level of normalcy in his life. He absolutely loves to get out of the house if only for a ride. He plays T-ball with a local Challengers Little League team for special needs children. He loves to watch his sisters with their activities. Being able to bring Isaac out into typical society greatly enhances his life and overall well being, without help

Thank you for reading our story. It barely even touches the tip of the iceberg

This week is the week

A Letter from Lorelei

I am writing this letter on behalf of Kelly Wasko

Kelly and I were once roommates, or even a stranger the shirt off her back. She participates every year in the Toys for Tots drive, actively encouraging all of her friends and acquaintances to give, even if it’s just a dollar.

Kelly has been through a great deal of trials and tribulations over the years. She is always one to pick herself up and keep going, in honor of her sister. Kelly has two small children, Dominick and Danica, and a beautiful 20yr old 'mini-me', Meghan. Dominick and Danica's father left when Danica was just 7 days old. Kelly has struggled to bring up her two small children in a loving and safe environment, always putting them first. She has never had any kind of support from their father, either financial or physical. Kelly is truly a fighter. Meghan lives in Colorado, her brother and sister and has a close and loving relationship with all three of them.

Finding a donor for a bone marrow transplant is difficult. The odds of finding a match are one in ten million. Kelly was fortunate enough that her seven year old son, citing it as an elective procedure. Kelly needs this transplant, not only to save her life, but to make certain she is there for her children. Kelly has no other family support and her children will have no where to go. It’s a dire situation that calls for your support. Kelly would give everything to someone in need and now she has finally learned that it is OK to ask for help. She is asking now, as are her friends and children. Please help to make her transplant possible
and give anything that you can. Her future and that of her children are depending on it.

Sincerely

The instruction set closely mimics Intel syntax x86 assembly.

So far the feature set is minimal, I've found that a well-coded program written for TVM can match a fully-optimized C program. Also in my tests, I've found that TVM programs aren't that much slower than x86 assembly running natively. So far, the performance of TVM has been no worse than 1/4 the speed of hand-coded x86 binaries.

TVM doesn't offer many of the high level language features of something like Python or Lua

When we floated the idea to other people and groups,” by Jessica Litwak. This is a play about the life and loves of Emma Goldman

Emma Goldman, plus an early feminist, labor activist and radical thinker in all ways. The play traces a short period in her life when she was on the run from the law, and fearing for her life. She was a Russian immigrant factory girl who became a labor activist/organizer and fiery orator on the speaker circuits in the early 1900's. She fought for free speech, women's right and free love long before those concepts were popular. We hope to bring her story to you and wider audiences through the medium of radio theater.

There are of course significant costs for making this happen, pay actors, etc. but we believe the end product will be outstanding, and will build strong support and acclaim for the station.

But this cannot all happen with the support of only a few of us. It will truly take a large majority of us shoulder to shoulder pushing forward to reach this goal. There is much you can do. First and foremost, plus further descriptions of the play, the actors, the playwright, and what we are trying to achieve.

I'm trying to break into the writing game

I wrote a dystopian sci-fi novel about a man who plots a false-flag operation against his own people because he's obsessed with control, worrying that man is little more than an animal and fearing that he may be nothing better himself.  There is a whole cast of characters, ranging from an alcoholic outlander ex-revolutionary to a man-child in a position of high power, and many more in between those two.

Anyway, so if you or anyone you know wants a free kindle book, [the link is here](http://www.amazon.com/The-Walls-of-Samwel-ebook/dp/B00AVMIZL8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359387225&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+walls+of+samwel).

I was hoping to use the power of the Internet and Reddit's kindness to overwhelm her with business cards from around the world. Do you think you could spare a stamp and a few minutes of your day to drop a few cards in the mail? They don't have to be yours. They could be a card from the restaurant down the street, a mechanic,  one of your colleagues... it doesn't matter. Just grab a few during your travels and anonymously drop them in the mail. Just a few cards from cool places will go a long way. Even if you can't send some cards, how about an upvote to get this in front of more people?

Yesterday the ability to see both the vote count and the profile photos of the people that voted has disappeared.

I did speak with the contest sponsor, or because the rules were not specific against cheating...they might let the contest run it's course and take this as an expensive lesson for next time.

And that right there is wrong...that someone can spend $20-$30 for a bunch of fake votes and get $5, and I'd be in the lead right now.

I did report a boatload of the fake profiles to Facebook

Before this happened, the majority of the people who entered the contest didn't follow the rules...which state you MUST have your photo taken in one of two stores...so they're disqualified for not following the rules.

They may end up terminating the contest early...but in the event the information has been removed because I reported the cheating...and they are continuing the contest under the 'expensive lesson' theory...I am asking for help.  Please vote for me.  

I'd like to win the furniture HONESTLY.  Which means REAL people voting...not spending $20 for a couple hundred votes.  It's not just about winning the furniture.  Yes

The site is essentially for reviews. I think we would all agree that there doesn't seem to be a one-stop-shop for reviews online

Snowglo is different. Snowglo is a community based review site

The site generates income by affiliate links to Amazon, earning the users badges on the site. These badges can be shown off on the user's profile.

The site links in perfectly with Facebook and Twitter

Personally I think it's a solid idea. The site has some decent features which will entice users to a repeat visit

He runs a two-man company by the name of [ZONOsanitech](http://zonosanitech.com), based out of Roswell, Georgia. 

Just a few days ago he told me that his company was being considered for a $250, much less if he won. So, what do you say Reddit? Could you help out an engineer in need?

If you've made it this far you might want to know about his company. Both my mom and dad got laid off around 2008 and my dad chose to follow his dream of bringing frozen bananas to everyone, Canada and the west coast. Right now we're meeting demand, a pretty solid demand, but can't yet exceed it. To grow the business we need a larger facility and to scale up; this grant would allow it. The 250 votes are a minimum to be considered, and don't guarantee he'll win, or cost you anything but time. For the size of reddit, 100 is nothing.

I'm not an Apple fanboy, nor do I hate Google, but it has become quite sad how little discussions can be had without devolving into an Apple vs. Google argument. Can't we all just buy products we like and get along?

The answer is usually no, one I've just started. I'd love for it to pick up and become an active subbredit, so that people who are annoyed by biased moderation like myself can find an equally informative source for technology news and can also hope to find meaningful discussion that doesn't devolve to Apple vs. Google or Microsoft vs. Linux or whatever.

&gt; It's too hard now, the firm that sells you Internet access would be required to track all of your Internet activity and save it for 18 months, along with your name, the address where you live, your bank account numbers, your credit card numbers, and IP addresses you've been assigned. 

&gt;Tracking the private daily behavior of everyone in order to help catch a small number of child criminals is itself the noxious practice of police states. Said an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation: ""The data retention mandate in this bill would treat every Internet user like a criminal and threaten the online privacy and free speech rights of every American."" Even more troubling is what the government would need to do in order to access this trove of private information: ask for it.

&gt;I kid you not -- that's it

What makes that even more dangerous is this little bit:

[Article in the Yale Daily News (Dan was an undergrad at Yale)](http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/nov/29/daniel-siegel-11-dies/)

From a personal perspective: Dan and I grew up and went to school together from the time we and my twin brother were in preschool until we graduated high school together, but Dan was the only boy in the whole group who was always nice to me and defended me.  He is pretty much the reason I survived middle school lol.  He was just the nicest person you could imagine, in addition to being brilliant.

The Knock

Did you hear that knock at your door?


I think you did. C'mon answer it.


Go ahead – it’s only me. You're not afraid of me

Look I have a package under my arm just for you. Everyone likes packages. You love deliveries. You know you want to see what it is and who it’s from. It's something special; I'll tell you that.


I wrapped it myself. Just for you. You know it’s your favorite paper and your favorite color.


Are you going to make me knock again? Please don't. I get awfully impatient. We can't have anybody see me now can we? So please hurry.


See my uniform? Doesn't that inspire trust? It should. I spent a long time making it. I think it looks pretty good. Good enough anyway. Everyone else trusted it. 


And my nametag. Can't you see I'm wearing a nametag? You can always trust a guy with a nametag


If you look really hard you can see my truck parked in the street. It looks real doesn't it? 


And I even put a phone number on the side. Would a bad guy put a phone number on his truck? And look at that smiley face. Everyone trusts a smiley face


They're only magnets. I'll pull them off as soon as we are done. I don't think you'll mind.


Please answer the door. I've waited a long time for this. I don't have much more time. Do you know how long I've been watching you; getting your schedule down?


I know you're home. I've looked at my notes. There's no one with you


I promise I won't be long. I've gotten faster. Now it takes me all of about 5 minutes to finish. That's fast right? I think it is. Maybe I can be faster today.


C'mon please hurry. There's not much time left.


I can see the light change in the peep hole. I know you are watching me. I'm just a delivery man. Look at my smile.


No


And I'll just need to step inside. I'll tell you I'll wait for you to go put my package down. But I won't. I'll just step inside and shut the door. I'll wait for you just inside the door as to not alarm you.


Ah

For 12 consecutive years

The past 3 to 4 years

Though other shows in the circuit have remained prosperous (namely Vibe, it is due to the fact that Fusion is placed toward the end of the dance season, where many of these teams have performed certain sets, and may not have choreographed anything new until the last show, Body Rock. 

Therefore, face the possibility of not graduating until all the seed money is at least paid back. At this point, my girlfriend has set aside $2000 to give to UCSD, as the show is happening in less than a week, and ticket sales are far from breaking even.

And so, enjoy those shows and want to see real and not-gimmicky choreography, please check out [the Fusion website here](http://www.fusionhiphop.org). 

If you are considering attending, or $26 at the door, I can get you presale tickets for $21, or if you end up bringing a crowd, I might be able to get my hands on a free ticket for you. 

Thank you for listening. Again
