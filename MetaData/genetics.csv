However, and books/documentaries that have no scientific citations on the issue are increasing in popularity and causing the issue to become blown out of proportion (in my opinion), often with a lack of respect for the science put into the safety and sustainablilty of GMOs. 

I was wondering what other geneticists though about this issue? I could not find anything on here yet that discussed/debated this issue.
I feel that there is mostly a consensus between geneticists that GMOs are not as harmful as the uninformed public thinks they are

1353625103.0,13n2s4,Big Bad Monsanto,JayK1,24,5,14,"I happened across an old article tonight about how evil and destructive Monsanto is. It reminded me about an argument I had a few years ago about GM. Some guy sitting next to me in college told me about how Monsanto sued a farmer in Canada called [Schmeiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser) because his field was accidently contaminated by a small amount of GM seed. I had to concede the point and admit that was terrible. I looked it up later and it turns out Schmeiser intentionally planted his field with Monsanto seed

So I started looking for other reasons Monsanto and GM are evil. A Reddit article calling Monsanto the most evil corporation in the world linked to [this article](http://endthelie.com/2011/07/10/the-worlds-largest-human-experiment-gmos-roundup-and-the-monsanto-monstrosity-part-one-2/) and about how toxic RoundUp herbicide is. Which I accept I suppose

People seem to be most irate at the idea Monsanto of suing farmers whose fields were accidently contaminated by their crops however. There's certainly ample Google results for it. The thing is

&gt;""74-year-old Mo Parr is a seed cleaner; he is hired by farmers to separate debris from the seed to be replanted. Monsanto sued him claiming he was ""aiding and abetting"" farmers

&gt;""There's no way that I could be held responsible

But that's not what the [court documents say](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10716318230859406779&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr) (check out the ""Finding of Fact"", despite receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Monsanto.

Apparently

So, although this was at least partly due to drought conditions. Still, maybe farmers should have been more adequately informed about the crop's increased susceptibility to drought, if that's the case. I know they made Agent Orange, which was a seriously harmful substance. They should absolutely face the consequences for that. As should [Dow Chemical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange#Vietnamese_victims_class_action_lawsuit_in_U.S._courts), who are equally responsible and don't seem to garner the same vitriol. On the topic of proportional anger, let's not forget [Union Carbide and Bhopal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster)

I'm not saying Monsanto are good or pleasant. I'm not agreeing with the overarching concept of corporatism. But all this hate directed at Monsanto seem to be the result of general dissatisfaction with negative capitalism combined with vague anti-GM sentiment and misinformation.

From the [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D4#48-base_pair_VNTR):

&gt; The 7R allele appears to have been selected for about 40,000 years ago had a higher frequency of 7R/long alleles. They also showed that nomadic populations had higher frequencies of 7R alleles than sedentary ones. More recently it was observed that the health status of nomadic Ariaal men was higher if they had 7R alleles. However in recently sedentary (non-nomadic) Ariaal those with 7R alleles seemed to have slightly deteriorated health.

Amazing!

I've recently been devouring books on evolutionary biology

My question is regarding the crossing-over process during meiosis. 

So you have your two chromosomes

So in the example I'm thinking about

Right so far?

Now, the chromosome splits in the MIDDLE of that section of code?  Say you have the mother allele for blue eyes and the father allele for green eyes (I know this probably is a very simple example, but for the sake of argument...).   If the allele splits in the middle of the relevant coding regions, after recombination you'll end up with half-blue, half-green allele on the same leg of new chromosome?  Would this section of DNA in general be viable?  Or would the manifested phenotype just be determined by the equivalent section of code on other chromosomes other leg (arm? what do you call the two bits of a chromosome?!)

So after years of mistakes and switching majors I think I've finally decided what I want to do. Went from a math major, to nursing and now I think I've finally found something I'm actually passionate about.  Realized it through a class about the technological singularity of all things, but it finally clicked and I'm almost positive this is what I want to do. It actually feels right unlike all the other majors I was doing just because I had to do something.

I started school at a public school in Illinois, and perhaps from a bit too much partying in college. ;)  My gpa was about a 2.4.  The new school I'm going to isn't really as good of a school as I would have liked, but it's another public university and it was one of the best schools within driving distance from my parents house, which I'm staying at right now to save money. It's still almost an hour away.  GPA doesn't transfer to the school, so it starts all over, but the old grades would still be on my transcript.  I'm assuming I'll probably have to go to grad school.  How much would these schools look at the former gpa?  

I know I need to get some lab experience, I don't really expect her have much information for me.  Most of my classes right now are trying to catch up on gen eds, since the curriculum at this school is different, so there isn't really a science teacher at the school I could ask yet. Would any chem or bio lab research be good? Or, should I definitely try to find something more related to what I want to do?  There's a few hospitals around here would those be a good place to ask?

Also the school I'm going to doesn't have an actual genetics major.  So I was thinking bio major with a chem minor?  Or is there something that would be better than that? Obviously I would try to take a lot of genetics related classes for electives.

So basically if someone can give me a bit of a roadmap of what the best way to go about this is it would be extremely appreciated.  No one I know has any experience with science or even medicine

TLDR;

1. As a transfer student how much do grad schools look at the previous schools GPA?
2. Where are good place to look for research jobs?
3. Is chem or bio research sufficient
4. Is a bio major with a chem minor an alright substitute if my school doesn't offer genetics?
5. How important is grad school to find a job? Is there a big difference in salary?",,t5_2qi3y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/11qj0l/i_think_i_want_to_become_a_genetic_engineer_help/

So, and Strain 2 has the other mutation, but with the wrong marker. So, to get a strain of yeast with all 4 mutations, I do as follows:

Find the plasmid with the marker I want Strain 2 to have. PCR this plasmid (it has loxP sites flanking the marker I want). Transform this PCR product into Strain 2 to get mutation 4 with the appropriate marker. PCR the knocked out gene just created in Strain 2

Why is this the chosen methodology? The best I could come up with is as follows:

1)PCR the plasmid because you want a different marker - this plasmid has the marker you need.

2)Transform this PCR product into the yeast strain that has *only* the mutation of interest

3) PCR the yeast strain you just placed a new marker into.

4) Take PCR product from (3) and transform it into the strain with many mutations. Because the 2 strains are the same background (barring any mutations), knocking out the gene in the strain you are transforming.

My sister has very dark brown/black hair with a single stripe of solid white (like rogue from the x-men

I have brown head hair, sideburns and neck are a calico mix of dark brown and ginger (in noticeable splotches). This coloring was also present as a teenager.

The authors developed a model for interpolating between the extremes of ""hard"" and ""soft"" selection. I don't recall all the details, fitness evaluated relative to the mean) and setting it equal to 0 corresponds to ""hard"" selection (i.e., fitness evaluated absolutely).

Any help finding this paper would be appreciated. I'm at a total loss,False,,t5_2qi3y,False,,,t3_18qyz8

Bone Marrow transplants are matched on 10 different proteins. Crazy enough one of the proteins that I have has never been recorded before internationally. This is considered a mutated gene and prevents me from finding a perfect 10 out of 10 match. However I did find a 9 out of 10 which okay but risky when it comes to the transplant and my body accepting the cells.

What I am asking is if there is anyone on reddit who is a geneticist or knows anything about genetics and could help point me in the right direction to more information on the protein and even how it looks (may sound cheesy but I was to get it tattooed after all this is done with). I will gladly share any information I have on the protein and try and get anymore which will help me find out how this protein looks or anything else I can learn and understand more about this.

This has been the craziest year of my life but it has also taught me so much and more than I could ever learn with a semester of college.

There seems to be some confusion about what the ""common drug"" is that was used to inhibit aging in the muscle.  The top comment says it's Tamoxifen but I don't think that's the case; Tamoxifen I think is just being used to activate Cre to delete Spry.  After reading through the whole paper I'm still a bit confused.  [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10k8ml/scientists_make_old_muscles_young_again_in/c6e8v45) says the drug used to inhibit Fgf is SU5402 which I think may be correct

&gt;Fgf2 is both good and bad for muscle cells.  It's good for making them proliferate but bad for maintaining stem cells.  Old cells have too much Fgf2 and therefore not enough stem cells.  I think they used the chemical SU5402 to inhibit Fgf2 signalling as pointed out in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10k8ml/scientists_make_old_muscles_young_again_in/c6e8v45).  But I don't think that is a common drug and I don't think that is what the press release is referring to.  I don't even know if that chemical is used as a drug at all

Is it safe to say that in order to get from one certain place on the tree of life, that it would sometimes be necessary to go back to a much simpler form to do so?

I know it is possible for genes to shut off

In truth I don't think I have ever heard this discussed.

To the best of my knowledge, and I mean that in the sense that once a simple form of life has evolved into something more complicated (single cell -&gt; multi-cell), it will not evolve into something similar to its old simpler form ( multi-cell -/-&gt; single cell), if this is true, does that mean that in some cases it is impossible to go from a particular place in gene-space to another?

There are five dragon phenotypes (green, bronze, blue). Females are either gold or green; gold dragons are the largest of all as well as the most rare dragons of either sex, while green dragons are the smallest of all and the most common.  Males are either bronze, brown, or blue.  Bronze dragons are the largest, followed by browns, the smallest types are the most common.
Only the gold queens are fertile, in approximately the following percentages: &lt;1% gold, 5% bronze, 15% brown, 30% blue, and 50% green.

To recap what I (think I) know:

Certain genes can ""remember"" whether they are of paternal or maternal origin

Ridley says (In chapter 15, but that imprinted genes somehow escape the DEmethylation, and this is what messes with cloning using somatic cell transfers.

Here's what I don't understand: he goes onto say that if you used a female body cell to clone, all the imprinted genes would be turned off. From there, he says ""A cloned mammal would be born with all its imprinted genes either on or off on both chromosomes, [...] causing development to fail.""

But here's where I'm confused - why would they all be (individually?) switched on or off on both chromosomes?  And what difference does it make whether the donor cell comes from a male or a female? Further

I feel like I'm missing something blindingly obvious here, can you help explain genomic imprinting to a silly little lighting designer?
