Here's what we know:

**Bargnani is owed $23m over the next two years**
Sure, the money argument shouldn't be an issue. We broke even and got back a MUCH better player than who we gave up.

**It's still a terrible contract**
Sure, Shumpert has a qualifying offer, not sure of Hardaway's rookie deal). In fact, Novak was the only guaranteed contact in 2015, and we got rid of it.

**Bargnani has proven to be a 20 ppg score**
Whether it's the Raptors or a D-league team, it will help this team more than what the combination of Novak and Camby would've been able to.

**We gave up a 1st round pick in 2016**
While anything can happen in 2016, similar to what the Heat did a few years back. If so, we're talking about losing a 20+ draft pick and a 2nd rounder. Whoever that player is in 2016, I find it very difficult to believe that that player will have more potential than Bargnani today. If the Knicks are a lottery team by 2016, then sure, this deal will come back to haunt them. But, I just don't see that happening considering we may have the most salary cap flexibility this team has ever seen. And, it won't be difficult to lure star athletes to NYC.

**Novak and Camby have zero value**
If we had a player who averaged 8.4 points, we managed to get a player in return who has has proven to have enough talent to be a starting NBA player.

**Bargnani doesn't play defense**
If Woody managed to get Melo and the crew to play defense

All of these arguments don't convince me that this deal is as terrible as some fans make it seem. I don't think it's a steal for either team. The Raptors wanted to get rid of Bargnani; the Knicks wanted to get rid of Camby and Novak. They both got what they wanted.

However

**Are the Knicks receiving a player better than Garnett and Pierce?**

**Is the player's name Rondo? If not

**Did we get an all star in return for nothing

**Can we start the season tomorrow with this squad?**

... I'm sure there are a few other arguments we can add to this list. I need help understanding why so many people hate this deal. I just don't see it.",self,t5_2rur5,False,,Knicks1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/1hf90p/help_me_understand_why_the_bargnani_trade_is/

Honestly, and we don't have to sit on these vibes for multiple days.

Our team is very good, the same confidence that led us to lose the last 2, and we have the feeling of desperation. I really do feel that this next game will be the closer. Watching the post-game interviews, it seems like they understand why they've been playing sub-par. It's not our defense, it's the offense. Woody is gonna have a field day with them at practice today, and I really do think they'll get it drilled in their heads that they have to move the ball and create good shots to win games.

1. The refs were pretty terrible all around. As Clyde mentioned in the telecast

2. The perimeter defense was pretty sloppy. The Nets, should not have gone 15/31 from beyond the arc. Lin was having trouble all night getting around off-ball screens for Deron. They tended to collapse towards the middle and get out of position thus leaving capable shooters open for 3.  Shumpert is an excellent perimeter defender who we will need when facing elite PGs who can create their own shot like Deron. Lin, for all his strengths, is still lacking defensively; especially coming off screens (off-ball and on-ball).

3. I know it's the product of the defensive system, and likely in, 9 times out of 10. I think Woodson should take a page from our opponents playbook and hedge hard on screen and rolls when playing an elite PG. Hopefully the perimeter D was more of an anomaly. 

4. Amar'e has to step it up all around. His patented 15-18 ft jump shot was consistently long all night. For the year, has only gone in at [34.1%](http://www.82games.com/1112/11NYK12.HTM) for the year. Last year, his jump shot percentage was pure [44%](http://www.82games.com/1011/10NYK19.HTM) of the time. Not to mention, I think Amar'e must the worst hands in the NBA. He's awkward whenever he dribbles (which usually consists of recklessly driving to the basket with his head down) he often bobbles passes, and gets ""would be"" rebounds snatched every now and then. I have faith in my boy though.

5. Carmelo was really put in a tough spot for tonight. He knew going into this game that the team was playing tremendous without him. That being said, the offense lost its flow and Melo seemed forgotten. Personally, I think the Knicks still need to get him the ball on the wing for isolation plays. I think I saw 2 maybe 3 instances where Melo initiated an isolation play. Let's not forget that he is an incredible isolation player that can get to the line (not with tonight's officiating crew) at ease.

1367862349.0,1dsys2,How does this sub feel about the lone writer who voted for Carmelo Anthony as the MVP,macdoogles,36,6,35,"There's [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ds1td/i_voted_carmelo_anthony_for_mvp_gary_washburn/) post on the frontpage of /r/nba. Gary Washburn was the only one who didn't vote for Lebron James and instead voted for Carmelo Anthony. Below is his argument. Do you agree?

&gt; _When I placed my NBA MVP vote a few weeks ago

&gt; _I voted for Carmelo Anthony based on his importance to the New York Knicks, have failed to be relevant._

&gt; _When the voting was announced Sunday afternoon, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, and perhaps even Kobe Bryant would snag a first-place vote or two._

&gt; _Firstly, I don’t walk around asking fellow sportswriters their answers to the US History quiz. I had no idea whom the writers were voting for, so this was no LeBron conspiracy._

&gt; _Secondly, and I think what Anthony accomplished this season was worthy of my vote. He led the Knicks to their first division title in 19 years._

&gt; _That’s a long time ago._

&gt; _Anthony led the league in scoring average and basically carried an old Knicks team to the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Amar’e Stoudemire missed most of the season with knee issues, leaving Anthony, J.R. Smith, and a bunch of lottery picks from the mid-1990s to win 54 games and beat the Miami Heat three times._

&gt; _LeBron can win the MVP award every year. He is that good. And it’s to the point where I put him on a Michael Jordan scale. Jordan won five MVP awards but could have earned 10. In the 1992-93 season, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals and shot 49.5 percent from the field._

&gt; _And the MVP award went to Charles Barkley._

&gt; _So my vote had more to do with Anthony and less to do with the dominance of LeBron. If you were to take Anthony off the Knicks, a defensive stalwart, and a fearless point guard. The Heat are loaded._

&gt; _If LeBron was taken away from the Heat, but I chose to reward a player who has lifted his team to new heights._

&gt; _The Knicks were slapped around last season by the Heat in the first round, an All-Star-caliber player when healthy, has been dealing with knee problems the past few years. Chandler is a defensive center, and Jason Kidd, Marcus Camby, and Rasheed Wallace are beyond aging. That leaves the scoring load to Anthony and the mercurial Smith._

&gt; _The perception that I knew the other 120 voters cast their first-place votes for LeBron and that I went against the grain as some kind of statement is inaccurate. I have covered the league for years, certain players just elevate their games. I thought Anthony was the most valuable player to his team this season, not the best player in the league._

&gt; _And the fact that Anthony is struggling in the playoffs

&gt; _LeBron had a marvelous season and should be the first player to win seven MVP awards

&gt; _I definitely understand those who believe LeBron should have won unanimously but it’s no easy task making the Knicks relevant again and I think Anthony deserved my kudos for this season._",self,t5_2rur5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/1dsys2/how_does_this_sub_feel_about_the_lone_writer_who/

Carmelo Anthony: Drafted third in 2003

Kenyon Martin: Played for Denver from 2004 to 2011 after leaving the Nets

Marcus Camby: Played there from 2002 to 2008 after the Knicks traded him in the ill-fated Antonio McDyess deal. Had his best years

J.R. Smith: Rarely got along with coach George Karl after the Nuggets traded for him in 2006

Raymond Felton: Was miserable in Denver after getting shipped in the Anthony trade and got demoted to the bench so Ty Lawson could start. He asked for a trade in the summer of 2011 and got one to Portland. So nondescript was his Nuggets career, he played there once, too.

A ton of storylines in this one. The Knicks lead the Eastern Conference and are as good as they've been since Patrick Ewing was in his prime. The Lakers are reeling

But all that said, but Kobe is still at the top of his game, Dwight is still as dominating a force as there is in the game, and Pau is still a top three power forward when he wants to be. On any given night they could explode, and this is as big a stage as any, so you have to believe they'll show up motivated.

These teams seem to match up really well, Melo vs. Wallace, Lopez vs. Chandler, and Morrow vs. Smith off the bench. The Knicks don't seem to be favored in many of those, but it's time for them to make a statement and win a tough game on the road on the second night of a back-to-back, something they've done just once in three tries this year.

1st unit (avging about 30-35 mins) and age: PG: Raymond Felton (28), PF: Stat (29), C: Chandler (30)

Ok, players like Kidd and Camby were considered valuable assets by teams as recent as this summer, but now that Knicks have got a hold of them  and the knicks got slapped with this old team stigma, there is a lot of negativity. Let us remmember not only that these players were starters this past season for other teams, but will be coming off the bench for us for limited minutes. Are we really saying Kidd and Camby cant still be productive coming off the bench for maybe 15 mins a game? Also, our 2nd unit still involves younger guys (Novak, Brewer, where to spot up,False,

He looks just as good as he did last year and has even been a threat on offense from long range.

Don't even get me started with Copeland not playing much. He's another scorer which can take pressure off JR and Melo. But Woodson just can't see it.

Adding another PG is a must do situation for the Knickerbockers. As Lin is the only true PG left (since Davis is gone for 12 months) adding Kidd would certainly be a smart move. The Mid-level Exception should be used on players like Ray Allen, allowing us to fill the SG position with an excellent player in the emergency case that Fields continues being mediocre and Shump suffers a sophomore slump.

Thus

**PG: Jeremy Lin / Jason Kidd**

**SG: Ray Allen / Landy Fields / Iman Shumpert**

What a difference. EVERYBODY moves!! There are so many screens

The key is that no one is the focal point of the SA system. It's about creating GOOD, scrambling, the entire floor opens up and you will have multiple options every possession. Melo can still get his shots, maybe just a few less, but they can be higher quality looks, making him even more dangerous. 

Even this season, but it seemed like as soon as they got in a tight game, all that went out the window. 

I don't know if Woodson can do it. If he's capable of designing a comprehensive offense and then keeping players like Melo and JR (if he's still around) accountable to sound team principles, he has to go. Problem is, I don't know if any coach can accomplish that as long as Melo refuses to allow things to change and fully commits himself to being a true team player at all times, ESPECIALLY in pressure situations.

1334540992.0,sbogy,What are you taking away from the Miami game?,barnun,20,1,29,"My impressions: 

1. Only 6 players bothered to show up. Essentially, Smith and Chandler. The fact that Miami has nothing after their Big 3 is their Achilles Heel, along with their lack of size, if an opponent can expose it. NY can and should get more out of their bench and role players than they got today. 

2. Fields is a big key and needs to get his head out of his ass. If he can get more aggressive and knock down even a couple more shots, or brick a shot? He's capable of playing better but right now he's a liability. 

3. This game was frustrating but encouraging. From a depth perspective, and maybe their size and depth turns this into a win. 

4. I'm excited about coach Woodson's investment in JR Smith. Looks like the support is paying dividends and Smith is quickly developing into a more reliable and complete player.

5. They need to run some plays for Novak. This guy is a tremendous shooter, and making a point of trying to get him open? even if he can't get free, you force the defense to shift or switch, creating opportunities elsewhere. 

6. Box the fuck out. NY got that memo when it was already too late. If they protect the defensive glass

Bottom line for me, and you shouldn't be able to stick 3 players with a bunch of scrubs and win it all. Dallas beating them with depth and solid team play was refreshing, and I pray it happens again, preferably by NY, but otherwise my favorite team is anyone playing the Heat. ",,False,t5_2rur5,True

Potential for 2nd round? ECF? Title?



Lin/Kidd


JR/Shump/James White


Melo/Novak


Stat/Melo/Jeffries (?)


Chandler/Camby




Ok, they are good pickups; Kidd still can pass as far as I can tell, and we only need him to play about 20-25 minutes as a backup to Lin. Camby is also old as hell but he is still effective; I think his rebounding efficiency was only second to Dwight (if I am not mistaken). We also don't need him to play heavy minutes as he will be backing Chandler. 

Defense has not been as much of an issue as our offense, and Tysons defense is superb. JR smith shoots too many dumbass shots, but he is a good player coming off the bench and is cheap (maybe starting till Shump returns). Novaks a knock down 3 point shooter, but hopefully works on moving off the ball better. Injuries plagued us last year, and hopefully it is not as much of an issue this year.  Hopefully Woodson can mesh this team well enough. Our players are apparently working hard. Carmelo apparently lost 12 pounds and Amare is apparently working hard as well, with a trainer going everywhere with him. 

The talent/potential is clearly there. 2nd round in playoffs is safest bet, I am biased as fuck but what do you expect) I can even see us contending for the chip. I know, I know, lets win 2 games first in the playoffs first, but shit I think the Knicks are sending a signal that they are trying to make a run. 

Also, I dont believe that shit, and was wondering where others were at within this debate.

Amare sucks.  That's right, he played like an MVP.  But since he's been injured, he's been absolutely TERRIBLE.  Amare has been whack for over a year and it has more to do with injuries than his actual play.

2. **Jeremy Lin**: He struggled for much of the game and finally got things going in the 4th. It was impressive how he showed resilience. Perhaps Lin's best quality is his fearlessness. Say what you want about his sometimes hapless defensive, but he never back down from a tough situation. He takes the ball to the rim strong every time, unless he changes it up with a well timed floater, and he's not afraid of contact in the slightest. I'm pretty sure he's already gotten 2 bloody noses since taking over as the Knicks floor general. And when it matters most, Jeremy Lin comes to play. In the last 12 minutes it seems that Jeremy Lin just simply makes plays. 

3. **Carmelo Anthony**: Yes, you cannot deny the defensive intensity he has displayed since Mr. Potato Head (term of endearment) has taken the clipboard. He did a great job defending; last night especially. He closed out on jump shots by getting his hand up in their grill consistently, and occasionally made well timed swipes at the ball when a player got careless. While this is great, I wonder why it has taken him this long to start putting in an A effort on defense. Literally every great, and I mean *great* NBA superstar, has been an excellent defender. Jordan, Kobe, Kareem

I'm excited for the Knicks going forward. They are absolutely stacked and the players seem to be buying into the whole team-first-defensive-minded-grind-it-out-at-any-cost mentality Woodson is instilling. Hopefully

-----------------------------------------------------------
**Tim Hardaway Jr. -  SG - 6'6'' - 199 lbs. - Michigan**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** Decent shooter

**Weaknesses:** Not a great defender period. Probably too small to defend most forwards. I personally think he is a little overrated

**Allen Crabbe - SG - 6'6'' - 200 lbs. - California**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** Good scorer, but he might not be as bad of a chucker.

**Weaknesses:** Limited ball handler

**Sergey Karasev -  SF - 6'7'' - 200 lbs. - Russia**

**Projection:** Mid to Late 1st round

**Strengths:** A lot of buzz around him lately

**Weaknesses:** Big surprise: defense. Not great at keeping guys in front of him. Do we really need another great shooter that can't play defense? Not a great athlete either (but not terrible

**Reggie Bullock -  SF - 6'7'' - 200 lbs. - [North Carolina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHnA94-hTC8)**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** He's what I'm looking for in a wing player. He's a reliable shooter that plays defense and can rebound too. All things we could use on the perimeter. Might not be starting quality out of the box

**Weaknesses:** Seems to be a common thread... but he's a little undersized for a wing player. He could stand to put on 20-30 pounds of muscle to help him guard larger players. Not a great ball handler and probably is never going to be a high volume scorer. Sometimes has trouble keeping opponents in front of him. Needs to develop some as a on-ball defender.

**Tony Mitchell - PF - 6'9'' - 235 lbs. - North Texas**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths:** Great athlete. Explosive jumper. Perhaps a young Amare/Kenyon Martin. He also can shoot. Would be great for pick and pops. Might be able to stretch the defense with some three's too (D'Antoni would love him). He definitely could be a dangerous player on the pick and roll. Talented shot blocker

**Weaknesses:** He's average height for PF (he might be closer to 6'8'' than 6'9'') but has a great wingspan (7'3''). He had a bad season last year and didn't respond well to a coaching change. His stock has dropped as a result (which might be a good thing

**Gorgui Dieng -  C - 6'11'' - 245 lbs. - Louisville**

**Projection:** Mid to Late 1st round (this would be my pick)

**Strengths:** Great size and length (7'4'' wingspan). A lot more polished that Withey (but might not be there when the Knicks pick). He reminds me a little of Serge Ibaka. Strong defender
 
**Weaknesses:** Needs to improve as a post player. Not extremely skilled and doesn't have many moves. He's not a high volume scorer either

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Jeff Withey - C - 7'0'' - 220 lbs. - Kansas**

**Projection:** Late 1st round

**Strengths**: Excellent defender and shot blocker. Protects the rim like a champ. Very athletic and a good pick and roll player. Reminds me a lot of Tyson

**Weaknesses:** Little offensive ability, like Chandler). Hustle isn't great at times. He's tall and has a good wingspan (7'3'') but weighs only 220lb. In perspective, LeBron (a forward, obviously) is listed at 250 and Tyson Chandler is 235 lbs. He needs to put on some muscle or he's going to get consistently out-muscled in the paint.

I'm a Celtics fan and wondering what you think of our match-up. I've seen a decent number of your games and think you're a better match-up for us than Indiana but that you're obviously the favorite with your recent play and home court advantage.

I think it's a good match-up for us because it's harder for you to create mismatches with Melo at PF because we can answer with Pierce and Green at the forward spots. If Chandler isn't fully healthy I think you'll have trouble stopping our offense (it will be low scoring because of pace but we should be possession efficient) but if he is then a lot will depend on if KG can draw him away from the hoop. If we had Rondo I'd be confident about the match-up but if he was we probably wouldn't be playing in the first round. I think you'll miss Ronnie Brewer because I'm not sure who can defend our second forward. I wish we had more consistent options to take advantage of your back-court.

Defensively we have the bodies to throw at Melo and Smith so, the Chandler/KG match-up will be the one to watch. If KG isn't mobile enough to recover on Chandler's roll to the hoop it will collapse our perimeter and open up way too many threes. Interestingly, you killed us from three in the one game we won against you but that's the big fear for us. Seeing Pierce or Lee trying to recover to the corner 20 times just because KG just can't play his normal stellar defense is basically my nightmare for the series. That and seeing Melo go 15-25 despite good defense against him.

It looks like both teams will be as healthy as we've been in a while (though very obviously not as healthy as we'd like to be) which is good to see. What are you watching out for in the series and how do you expect it to play out?",self,t5_2rur5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/1cd7jf/im_from_rbostonceltics_what_do_you_think_of_the/

Melo can keep playing if he wants because he's unstoppable, both of them for Indiana, and both plus Amare for Miami.

They had Melo, it really wasn't too awful. We'll have a chance to win, but I don't care at all if we lose.

Carmelo Anthony is the Knicks franchise player, if not the best, scorer in the NBA, and it’s easy to see why.  Melo has the ability to score, seemingly effortlessly, from anywhere on the court, and has one of the best pull up jumpers in the game.  His offensive ability helped to carry the Knicks to 54 wins and their first division title in 19 years, it is easy to question his offensive efficiency.  He shot only 45% from the field this season: the NBA’s 2nd best scorer Kevin Durant shot 51%.  On the defense end, health and age are something of a concern for Melo.  Late last spring he missed several games during the Knicks wildly unsuccessful West Coast road trip due to a bad knee.  Though he came back from those injuries playing great, and while he is the Knicks best scorer

Completely limited by the salary cap, moves was the trade he orchestrated with Toronto, which brought 2006 first overall pick Bargnani to the Knicks in exchange for Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, Quentin Richardson, a 2016 first round pick and 2 second round picks (2014, 2017).  While the departures of Novak, and Richardson were accepted, and that’s putting it lightly.  He played only 66 games over the last two seasons due to injuries, 41 points on 67% shooting

Only one year removed from winning Defense Player of the Year, was the backbone of a Knicks defense that turned many heads in November, and was in the top 10 of Field Goal percentage.  Unfortunately, Chandler’s season was derailed late in the season by a bulging disk, followed by the flu, which caused him to lose 10 pounds.  Offensively, Chandler’s only skills come from operating the pick-and-roll with Felton, if Chandler could develop any type of shot of his own, it’s tough to believe he actually will.  Chandler is one of the 4 players who will be coming off the books in 2015

Felton was one of the many casulties of the Carmelo Anthony trade back in 2010, Felton did a great job as the main man.  Though Melo is the most important piece of the Knicks offense, it all runs through Felton.  While he was injured last winter, the Knicks offense suffered, Chandler’s FG percentage in particular.  In addition to running the pick-and-roll, Felton has offensive strengths in his own right.  When Melo was not producing in game 4 of the Boston playoff series, with JR out, scoring 27 points in what eventually ended as an overtime loss to Boston.  How efficiently Felton plays next season will be key to how well the Knicks perform.

With the 24th pick in the draft, Hardaway was a steal at the 24th overall pick.  A good shooter with experience in a championship setting at Michigan, he can bolster an already deep backcourt.  Though he will have to earn his minutes playing behind Shumpert and Smith, this has the potential to be a good pick up for the Knicks.

3. Knicks need to get Copeland out there more

4. I feel like people will chuck this up to ""whining"" but the reffing was EXTREMELY atrocious last game. Worst I've seen in my life. Examples? Prigioni swats a ball out of bounds, gets called for a T. Kidd, defending Nate who was travelling, has to yell the appropriate call at the ref so that he'll call it. That's just off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. 

5. Chandler (though one of the most important players on the Knicks) clogs the lane and slows the offense a bit. Felton's shooting/lay-up woes are only amplified by the fact that Chandler camps in the paint with his defender. The paint was instantly opened up when Chandler/Noah left and Felton got to the rim and scored at will.

MAGIC
@Celtics

Assuming the Magic beat the Bobcats at home

The Knicks, Cavs and Bobcats have pretty much packed it in for the season so if the Knicks don't play down to the competition (which is completely possible that they do in one of these games) those should be wins.  I like the Clippers match up at home, especially if the Knicks are still in the hunt for the 6 seed by then.  The Hawks on the road is the toughest game in the final stretch IMO.

First off

I'm a mod over at /r/bostonceltics where we've built a tool to help fans play GM and try to map out their off-season decisions against the CBA rules. This tool is at an early stage right now because a lot of key data elements (like the 2013-14 cap figure and draft order) haven't been finalized yet but we're putting it out for some users right now for testing. Our goal is to post it onto /r/NBA right at the end of the season so we're trying to flush out any performance or math issues.

If you're interested in giving it a try

I'm posting this to a handful of teams so if you have questions about the tool

However, and that combined with consistent point guards is leading to great pass and find the open shot offense (well, not so much last night.  But, one game does not make a trend).

I think we'll begin to know if this is REAL  when we play back to back games against San Antonio and Memphis.

San Antonio's the other team that's playing TEAM basketball.  They're 5-1

I love the Memphis team (the players).  They play great defense.  Zach Randolph found his home in Memphis (and not here).  The guy has been a beast on the boards.  And let's not forget they were the start of our losing streak under D'Antoni last year.  And combining that with Gasol

So if we beat them

I'll want to see how we compare against Miami and L.A.

Would it be a roster change? Do you think they need to work on certain aspects of the game? Strength training? 

For Example: I think we should get rid of D'Antoni, for the D'Antoni system to work, but if we ran more of a half court offense who we have now would be fine. I think our defensive scheming is our biggest problem. We switch too much, and there are glaring mismatches that are never fixed throughout entire games. Also offesnively we have improved greatly since the beggining of the season, but there is still too much ball stoppage with Amare and Carmelo. I think these players need to get into their rhythms. Miami had some of the same problems, but their defense allowed them to overcome the lack of offense. I think on the offensive side of the ball they feature one of their all-stars a quarter or string of plays at a time, and whoever has a better defensive matchup usually ends up being the finisher, and he is great at drafting players,self,

1373158805.0,1hs10p,Where the minutes will go.,nicejerk,10,0,10,"As of today, Novak, Thomas

- Kidd (2043)
- Novak (1641)
- Copeland (862)
- Brewer (711)
- White (435)
- Thomas (392)

The rest were under 300 minutes (which is about 4 minutes per game), we can see that the two players who have the biggest shoes to fill are Kidd and Novak. I'm going to miss Copeland (he was one of my favorites) but, I think we'll manage replacing his 862 minutes (or, roughly 10.5 minutes per game).

###Kidds Minutes###
As of now, Kidd played along side Prigioni and Felton as the SG until (and after) Shumpert came back from his injury. With Shumpert starting the season fresh, I think we can safely assume that the production that Kidd gave us last season will not be as good as what we're expecting from Shumpert (given an extra 1000 minutes next season). 

###Novak's Minutes###
Novak was bad. In hindsight, even in his worst year was still better than what Novak gave us last year. The bad is that Bargnani played 80 games (09-10) was his only time playing 80 games. If he stays healthy, Bargnani will be a HUGE improvement over Novak with the potential to be a 15-18ppg deep-threat 7 footer.

###Remaining minutes (roughly 36 combined minutes per game)###
This is where our role players will have to come up big for us. Hardaway will have to play his best Chris-Copeland impression

So, Camby's and Thomas' production. I don't think any of these three expectations are too much to ask for, which is why I don't see a reason why this team can't perform at last year's level, or better.

1.  With JR starting Melo will have some pressure taken off him and hopefully we could see less iso ball
2. I believe K-mart will be able to help alleviate the defensive woes a STAT return to the second unit will necessitate
3. Look at our recent efficiency numbers

What do you guys think? Would Woodson keep JR coming off the bench to maintain Shump's defensive contribution to the starting unit? Would giving Novak's minutes to STAT be able to be a drawback in any way (or give melo a little extra rest)? This is also all barring us getting out of this round, 90, 90, 86) but the celtics picked up an extra 15 points lately from their blazing 3pt shooting.",,False,self,False,t3_1djigb
