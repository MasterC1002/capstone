1376664039.0,1khn9o,A fun script for Friday - make your friend's computer start talking to him/her,Sinisterly,38,2,8,"A co-worker of mine stumbled upon [this nifty blog article](http://pmckibbins.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/powershell-text-to-speech/) on how to make a text-to-speech call using PowerShell.

The article gives two examples:

* Call the SAPI.SPVoice COM object

* Load the reference to System.Speech

Where can this come in fun? Well, if you use the second method (or the pared down script below) you can make your victim's computer start talking to him or her. Here's how you do it:

1. Provide a distraction so that your victim leaves their computer unlocked

2. Enable PSRemoting on their workstation. A method for doing this would be using [PSExec](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx):

        psexec.exe /acceptEula \\(yourVictimsComputer) -d -h -s powershell.exe """"Enable-PSRemoting -Force""""""

3. Start a new PSSession connecting to their workstation:

        New-PSSession -ComputerName YourVictimsComputer

4. Load this function:

        function Say-Text {
            param ([Parameter(Mandatory=$true
            [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('System.Speech') | Out-Null   
            $object = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer 
            $object.Speak($Text) 
        }

5. Ensure that their volume is on. (For example

6. Start speaking to them by calling the function you just made:

        Say-Text ""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave""

Have fun

1373892626.0,1ic49m,How to (usefully) encrypt and store credentials.,meepstah,34,2,9,"I noted this in the other thread about credentials and figured more folks would see it here.  The problem

The solution is to provide your own key.  You can store it somewhere secure

So

So
    
    $key = (1,4,5,......,23,24)

Then

    Read-Host -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString -Key $key | Out-File .\adminpw.dat

And maybe put your key in a file too. 

    $key &gt; ./keyfile.dat

To use it

    $key = cat ./keyfile.dat
    $password = cat ./adminpw.dat | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key $key

Perfectly safe

Except securestrings suck. 

    $decrypted = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($password))


That's right

So

Speaking of which, I've got one application for this that really can't be duplicated.  

Suppose you wanted to run a script against a bunch of servers

So, for each box, I create a new cred: 

    $username = $computername + '\adminaccount'
    $cred = $cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential `
    -ArgumentList $username

Then call 

    invoke-command -credential $cred -computername $computername -scriptblock {get-process}

or whatever you want to run remotely

Obtaining the first three fields was easy as they are returned by the Get-Mailbox cmdlet. The last access time

    $mbx | foreach {Add-Member -InputObject $_ -Type noteproperty -Name LastLogonTime -Value (Get-MailboxStatistics $_.name).lastlogontime}
  
The second command loops through each mailbox and runs the command to retrieve the last time the mailbox was accessed. It then appends that information to the mailbox object as a property. Now that I have all my information in one object I can export the data easily:

* I break down some of the code for Run-Parallel in [this post](http://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/parallel-powershell-part-ii/)
* I list a number of references that discuss parallelization or performance in PowerShell [here](http://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/parallel-powershell/)
* [Script Repository link for Run-Parallel](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Run-Parallel-Parallel-377fd430)
* [Script Repository link for Foreach-Parallel](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Foreach-Parallel-Parallel-a8f3d22b)

These can be a big help.  I went from a domain wide query taking on the order of two days

There may be a better way to implement runtime tracking for timeouts.  Waiting to hear back from the pros : )

*Update*:

* For Invoke-Parallel (Run-Parallel):  Modified the way timeouts are tracked.  Instead of queueing up all runspaces in the pool immediately

* Boe [posted an idea](http://powershell.org/discuss/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=801) on using nested runspaces (i.e. create intermediary runspaces to track timeouts for actual runspaces).  This works

This is probably pretty elementary to this crowd- I'm new to powershell as a scripting language.  The other scripts I found for accomplishing this task were way too verbose IMHO.  

This script just takes the output of a DSQuery command and passes it to DSMOD and DSMOVE.  The items moved programmatically are labelled and time stamped.  A total of the newly disabled items and the duration of the task are calculated

1375653416.0,1jpaff,Using PowerShell to Monitor TCP/IP Socket Use.,jawapima,17,2,11,"I was asked to monitor the number of sockets a CRM installation was creating on a Windows 2008 R2 box. There were some custom applications on the machine not properly closing sockets that had been created. It seems the CRM machine was calling a local webservice to help sanitize leads that were being injected into the system


The event log was reporting the TCP/IP subsystem had run out of available sockets periodically.  After doing some research

I was interested in seeing exactly how many connections were being left open by this custom code. Using netsh gave me the answer; 


    PS C:\&gt; netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp
    Protocol tcp Dynamic Port Range
    Start Port      : 49152
    Number of Ports : 16384

    
So it appears this code is exhausting over 16


    HKEY\LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters 


But that seems sloppy at best. If the code is using up this many sockets, and then could take that to the development team, to have their code sanitized further to make sure all the connections that were being opened, were subsequently closed when no longer needed. 


I came up with this simple powershell script to run through a scheduled task every 10 minutes to check netstat -aonp ""TIME_WAIT""

1369109988.0,1eqtv1,Office 365 management tool! Just finished. What do you think?,jackmusick,14,2,9,"Hey everyone!

I've written and released an application called [NoCloud Office](www.nocloudleftbehind.com). Developed with Office 365 administrators in mind, variables, etc). 

I've been using this internally for months and have finally set it up for people to subscribe and create their own accounts to try it out and use. Here are some of the reasons why I think it's a good fit for a lot of people:

* Allows for quick access to clients and the ability to authenticate to their accounts and run scripts against their users. This eliminates the need for multiple scripts and allows you to create single scripts based on variables. One variable
* Has a suite of simple tools that are the bulk of what we as admins probably do for our clients. This includes password reset, etc. More to come!
* No worries about security and where your stuff is hosted. I run a database for authenticating to your account with NoCloud and it doesn't store any kind of sensivtive information like 365 credentials. I set out to create a tool
* Simple pricing. The whole per-client thing never made much sense to me. It's just $45.00 / month for an account and you can add as many clients

Does this sound like something anybody would be interested in? If so, too! Again, I've only been using this internally so I'm open to anyone's thoughts.

I'm going to finally do it starting with F5-pooled web servers and thought it would be a good idea to get some input from the community - in the event anyone has done this

The environment with the systems is all VMware VMs.  

Each group of servers is a group of 3 in a F5 pool.  At any time

Then, wait until the system is stable (low CPU utilization is the easiest indicator), then mark it back up in the pool... then wait for the F5 to ramp up connections to the system, then begin the process again with node 2 of 3.

I should be able to do all of that using the icontrol snapins (F5 tools) and MAYBE the powercli snapins (Vmware tools).. but i'm pretty sure I can do all of it with stock cmdlets and the icontrol tools.

The rough flow I see in pseudocode is:

1)  Read in in a list of pools and/or server names from  a file.

2)  for each line in the file

3)  After the mark-down

4)  When the connections are under a thresshold

5)  Watch the system stop responding to pings

6)  keep an eye on the CPU usage on the system.  when the average usage over 4 or 5 minutes is within a certain threshold

7)  Repeat for other systems in the 1st line.


I think that flow covers anything, that I don't do it (with reasons)... anything.  I want to make sure if I do this I'm doing it correctly.  It doesn't have to be fast, it just has to be stable.


Edit 1:  It's looking like while there are options to install patches via windows update (which would use WSUS if configured) on local machines easily

Edit 2: I determined that I have to use a less-than-ideal method to enable/disable machines from the pool.  There's a homebrewed ""make it easy to mark stuff up and down so nobody needs accounts to the F5"" method I'll have to use that has me toggling flag files instead of just marking up or down...  It's actually easier to implement but it's not as portable as it would be if i just use the icontrol cmdlets.

Also

Edit 3:  I finally got a chance to do some more playing and for actual windows patches

I haven't had a ton of time to dig into it yet but I've looked over 25% of the code and have had a successful test so far and these seem really well put together.

   I'm back with another hopefully interesting project.  I'd like to make a script that copies out all of the attachments from a user's Outlook Profile and stores them in a path I specify.  

   Here is the kicker

   Why?  We're migrating from Exchange 2003 to 2010 and are migrating all of the user's PST's to our central store

   So

   Ideally

    Inbox:
         Accounting Timesheets (has XLS documents)
         Time-off Approval PDFS  (full of PDF's)
         Fantasy Football Team    (Has more XLS)

   Such that the folder structure is similar to what they would've seen in Outlook.  

  This is what I've got so far:

    $outlook = new-object -com Outlook.Application 
    $inbox = $outlook.Session.GetDefaultFolder(6) 
    foreach ($group in $inbox.items |% {$_.attachments} | group     filename) { 
    trap { 
    Write-Host There was a problem saving $fName 
    Continue 
    } 
    $fName = ""C:\Powershell\Temp\$($group.Name)"" 
    $group.Group[0].saveasfile($fName) 
    if ($?) {Write-Host $fName was saved succesfuly.} 
    } 


EDIT: Hey guys

I've tested it and so far, but works.  Later I'll parameterize it.

Moving the machines from staged to the proper OU was a necessity for group policy processing to function correctly.

I decided to write a script that will place the machines in the proper OU, but found it too cumbersome. (I have many more machine names and locations to deal with than are listed here, and it ended up being over 50 lines of processing just for machines).

There's the link to the thread.  I'm a complete noob to powershell, but definitely not even close.


Here is where I am confused. I can open up a cmd and ssh into a linux server without a problem (using PuTTY, but when I try to do the same thing with powershell, failure ensues.  I know there's a difference between the two, where one is a scripting language and the other is....   just a console? 


I can run cmd from within a powershell instance and I can run powershell from within the prompt



I'm trying to make it so that I have just one interface where I can run all of my commands, or any unix shell like bash or what have you. 

Then there's Powershell ISE which I thought was perfect. Especially in Windows 8, just like my favorite text editors.

I'm tidying up a [PowerShell function](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Get-troubleshooting-c6b49d4a) that will query remote systems and return basic troubleshooting info.  This could be run by support or other IT folks when an issue with one or more systems is identified

Here's the info I'm collecting thus far:

* Basics: OS, Disk Space, etc.
* Current Users
* Events from Application
* File shares and open files
* [Netstat -ano results parsed and resolved](http://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/get-networkstatistics/)
* Installed Software
* Network adapter configuration(s)
* Processes
* Recent (user) profiles
* Recent reboots
* Services
* Services set to autostart and not running

Info I'm considering collecting:

* Autorun information
* hosts file
* Printers

Any tips on other basic troubleshooting information to collect or not to collect?  Do any of you have a similar query that can get troubleshooting off to a quick start?

This database also needs to be relational to their user account. Lucky for us, and Sharepoint. The one caveat of this attribute though, I am keeping the system of jpg &gt; byte &gt; jpg for continuity's sake; although theoretically you could convert the images mid-stream. 

Here is the main outline of how this process looks:

1. Crop image to a square layout

2. Resize/Compress image to be less than 100 KB

3. Convert the image to a byte form

4. Set the user’s thumbnailPhoto attribute to byte form of the image

5. Have a user GPO that executes a PowerShell script at logon

6. The PowerShell script retrieves the thumbnailPhoto attribute data and saves the data as an image file
   * Then the PowerShell script calls an executable where it passes the image in

7. User’s image is set

**Steps 1-3 should be processed by a script. I haven't written one for that though.**

**Step 4 as well should be handled by a script. The below can give you an idea where to start.**

    Import-Module ActiveDirectory
    $photo = [byte[]](gc \\path\to\edited\photos\user1.jpg -Encoding Byte)
    Set-ADUser user1 –Replace @{thumbnailPhoto=$photo}

**Step 5 you will want to create a new GPO. I setup one computer policy and one user preference to accomplish this.**

    Computer Configuration =&gt; Preferences =&gt; Windows Settings =&gt; Files =&gt; New File
    	Action: Replace
    Source File: \\domain.com\netlogon\domainLogo.bmp
    Destination File: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\User Account Pictures\user.bmp
    User Configuration =&gt; Policies =&gt; Windows Settings =&gt; Scripts =&gt; Logon =&gt; Add
    	Name: \\domain.com\netlogon\executeUserTile.ps1

**Step 6 below is the code to accomplish the actual picture creation and application.**

    # Executes PowerShell in STA (Single Threaded Apartment) Mode and then executes the actual script.
    powershell -sta \\domain.com\NETLOGON\userTile.ps1

1334277550.0,s74rf,Avoiding GUI lockup when running a command (e.g. a ping that fails),Plonqor,9,1,7,"So I've been writing a sort of dashboard GUI in PS

The basic concept is to create a background job, and if it is done, retrieve the result.

**Note:** I'm assuming you already have the code to create the GUI using Windows Forms

Step 1. Create the timer:

    $tmrPingResult = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Timer
    $tmrPingResult.Interval = 200 #Interval in milliseconds
    $tmrPingResult.add_Tick($tmrPingResult_Tick)

Step 2. The ping code (or anything else that causes the same lockup):

    Function PingComputer {
        #Start the ping job using -quiet to suppress output
        $j = Start-Job -InputObject $CurrentComputer {
                Test-Connection $input -Count 1 -Quiet
        }

        #The following allows the PingJob variable to be accessed by the whole script
        Set-Variable -Name PingJob -Scope script -Value $j 

        #Enable the timer to check for results
        $tmrPingResult.Enabled = $True
    }

Step 3. The timer code (runs on each tick):

**Note:** you could put this straight into *$tmrPingResult.add_Tick()* in step 1

    $tmrPingResult_Tick = {
        #Checks if job has completed
        IF ($PingJob.State -eq 'Completed') {
            $tmrPingResult.Enabled = $False #Disables the timer

            #Checks if ping was successful
            IF (Receive-Job -Job $PingJob) { #Ping successful
                ### PING SUCCESS CODE HERE ###
            }
            ELSE { #Ping failed
                ### PING FAILED CODE HERE ###
            }
            #Remove the job
            Remove-Job $PingJob
        }
    }

And that's it! Just running the function (in this case PingComputer) will start off the timer which will check for the result and run code based on it. This solution can of course be adopted for any other command that locks up the GUI

Hope this helps a fellow PoSHer!",,t5_2qo1o,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/s74rf/avoiding_gui_lockup_when_running_a_command_eg_a/

Any idea what could be going on there?  I can't imagine what the error is trying to tell me since that looks like the same type to me.  Am I just blind?

BTW

EDIT: Never mind... solved the problem.  (though I still have no idea what the underlying error is telling me)

EDIT2: Don't ya hate that?

I actually had 2 problems... the first was that originally tried using a much [more complicated chunk of code that didn't work quite right](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2007/02/28/calling-a-webservice-from-powershell/), and I should have started fresh in a new session)

The second was that I wasn't setting up a name space usefully.  Changing some of the lines to the following got rid of errors


    $service= New-WebServiceProxy -uri ""https://besnva.office.aol.com/enterprise/admin/ws?wsdl"" -Namespace BESAdmin
    $util= New-WebServiceProxy -uri ""https://besnva.office.aol.com/enterprise/admin/util/ws?wsdl"" -Namespace BESUtil

I was primarily interested in getting the failover history for cluster nodes. So I wrote a function that will use three parameters, the after day, in numbers, as in 14, if you wanted events after 14 days ago, and a before day, as in before 1 day ago. If no day parameters are entered it will assume 14 days for the after and 0 for the before. Additionally, since it can only pull the data from Server 2008 (if you have 2012 in your environment

I posted the [function](https://github.com/Polonius19/PoSH/blob/master/func_getfailoverhistory.ps1) to GitHub. It relies on another function

I added the fuction then wanted to get the mailbox count of 177 databases (all exchange 2010).  Using a foreach collection method takes about 20 mins to complete.  Here is what i have been using....

foreach ($database in $databases) {write-host $database (Get-Mailbox -database $database.name -ResultSize unlimited -WarningAction silentlycontinue).count}

after reading the foreach-paralell info and the help file

foreach-parallel -throttle 20 -inputobject $databases -scriptblock {{write-host $database (Get-Mailbox -database $database.name -ResultSize unlimited -WarningAction silentlycontinue).count}}

that line will run and complete in about 20 seconds but i get no output.  Being as i am new at this function and i'm not sure how it works any help would be great!!

1370701575.0,1fxdf1,fastest way to distribute a file(s) to thousands of Windows 7 boxes,titoonster,8,0,23,"Seeking advice. I'm looking for the fastest way to distribute file(s) or folders to approx 5000 windows 7 devices.  I'm essentially looking how to mimic the functionality of Windows Server DFS but for windows 7 devices. Tinkered with SCCM but it uses BITS and isn't fast enough.  So now i'm wondering if powershell is up to the task.  

So two parts: Anyone have any luck with not only a multithreaded file copy with jobs but also creating a single powershell script that is distributed amongst many servers that will partition the request and execute a task?

I'm thinking of a central powershell script that partitions the work writes to the slave servers that actually do the task with their subset of machines (avoiding double hop credential issues).  

Or would it just be easier to just use PS jobs and instantiate thousands of Robocopy instances?  

*EDIT
Thanks for your suggestions

I guess I should give some background

Your suggestions are solid with SCCM

I needed to know what event IDs were common on my server
line of a typical message might look like for each of these event IDs.

A typical Get-EventLog cmdlet
of the way there.  What it's missing is the first line of a message:

    PS C:\&gt; get-eventlog security | group InstanceId | ft -auto

    Count Name Group
    ----- ---- -----

     1940 4648 {System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntry
      484 4611 {System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntry

So what I ended up doing is breaking out the first entry of each group and 
displaying its first line.

    $logSource = 'Security'
    Get-EventLog $logSource | 
        group InstanceId | 
        % { 
            $count = $_.count

        } | 
        sort InstanceId | 
        ft -auto

(If you want to look at a log other than the security log
variable in the first line.)

I have a function that converts from integer to IP address. This works fine.

An example of this would be:

*First value received: -567235574

*Convert it to hex: de30ac0a

*segment it into four: de 30 ac 0a

*convert each segment to decimal: 222 48 172 10

*The last segment is the first segment of the ip address so swap it all around and add a few periods for readability: 10.172.48.222



I need to do the reverse of this which would be:

*Remove formatting and segment: 10 172 48 222

*convert to hex: 0a ac 30 de

*swap it back around: de 30 ac 0a

*press it into one: de30ac0a

*convert to decimal: -567235574


The function I have made for this does not seem to work

This is my function:

        function Compress-IPAddress
        {
        param([parameter(Position=0
            if(!$IPAddress.Contains('.')) {Write-error -Message ""Not a valid IP Address"" -RecommendedAction ""please use periods to denote each section of the ip address""; Return}

            $splitIP = @($IPAddress.Split('.'))
            for($i = 0; $i -lt 4; $i++)
            {$splitIP[$i] = ""{0:x2}"" -f $SplitIP[$i]}
            $IPHEX = ""$($SplitIP[3])$($SplitIP[2])$($SplitIP[1])$($SplitIP[0])""
            $CompIP = [int](""0x$IPHEX"")
    
            Return $CompIP
        }

At the moment I get an error of :
&gt;Cannot convert value ""0x2224817210"" to type ""System.Int32"". Error: ""Value was either too large or too small for a UInt32.""""

I can see this is because the numbers haven't been converted to hex though I am unsure why. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

        function Expand-IPAddress

There are three functions in this script

The main function Query-FileOnComp takes the dns name of a computer and a local path.  It will return an object containing name/path/fileexist properties.  If an optional parameter of -UNCtoCopy is populated it will copy that file to the computer.

This relys on a function Convert-LocaltoUNCPath

There is also a function Convert-UNCtoLocalPath which takes one parameter of a UNC and converts it to a local path.

Basically I've been tasked with automating the user archival process here at work. The process involves taking all users in the Awaiting Deletion OU in Active Directory

Currently this is the code I have:

     #gets the users from the Awaiting Deletion OU in Active Directory that are older than 60 days old. Lists the users account name
     $userlist = @(get-aduser -Filter 'whenchanged -lt $setdate' -searchbase ""OU=Awaiting Deletion,DC=org,DC=au"" | ft samaccountname)

At the moment it gets the correct list of users

I can pipe it into a file using out-file and it looks normal to me. But when I try to call it using $userlist[5] I can an error.

I am populating the box as such:

`foreach($ou in $DropDownArray )`
`{`
 `[void]$ouBox.Items.add($ou.Name)`
`}`

The Array is:

`$DropdownArray = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -LDAPFilter '(name=*)' -SearchBase 'OU=Sample' -SearchScope Subtree | select Name`

The function I am using that is trying to actually use the selected OU:

`Function Add-ADCN`
`{ `

`$path = $ouBox.SelectedItem`

`$cnpath = $filelocText.Text`

`Get-content $cnpath | foreach {`
`New-ADComputer -Name $_.ToUpper() -SamAccountName $_.ToUpper() -Path $path -passthru`
    `}`
`} `

The ComboBox is displaying the names as opposed to the OU structure. When I set the ""$path"" manually to the OU it works beautifully but I can't seem to get it to pull from the ComboBox properly.

Any insight?

EDIT: To clarify the ""$DropdownArray"" is pulling in a subset of OU's. I have them displaying in ""$ouBox"" as ""Name"" instead of ""DistinguishedName"" which would be the proper OU. So I need to pull the ""DistinguishedName"" into the $path variable but still want it to display as ""Name"" in the ComboBox......",,t5_2qo1o,1368109013.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1dzumt/pulling_data_from_a_combobox/

I'm not looking for somebody to write it

---------------

**The environment:**

* Multiple Server 2008
* Failover Clustering
* Many-person administration
* Running the script on a server that isn't one of the failover nodes
* 100 Resources spread out across 1 cluster
* About 50% of the resources are java.exe...

**The problem:**

My coding team doesn't have the time to fix a problem with their code. When failover manager fails over (or even gracefully turns off) the java.exe's they don't always turn off. Leaving us to find and kill erroneous javas.

**What I'd like to do:**

Get a list of the PIDs for all the JAVA.exe's on each node of the cluster. Then look on each node/server for any JAVA.exe's that aren't on that list and terminate the process.

It seems so simple. I don't know why I've been having so much trouble. I am generally just a script-kiddy, but our group and resource names are pretty dynamic and I'd hate to make something that breaks when somebody puts a space in a group name or something.

    $objServer | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -name Name -Value $Cluster.fqdn
    $objServer | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -name UniqueID -Value $Cluster.UniqueID
    $objServer | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -name SiteName -Value $Location.Name.""#text""

I then used **foreach** to loop through each network interface on the server. Sometimes theres only 1 network interface, or even more. Here is the code I was trying to use to store the information about each network interface. My original idea was to create a PSObject to represent each network connection and add NotePropertys to store the information. I then tried to create an object to represent the network interfaces as a group and add each individual interface as a PropertySet. My plan was then to add the object representing the group of interfaces as a PropertySet of the original server object. Here is the code I was using.

    $i = 1
    $objNetInterfaces = new-object PSObject
    foreach ($NetInterface in $Cluster.Machines.Machine.NetInterface){
    $objNetInterface = new-object PSObject -Property @{
    ClusterUniqueID = $Cluster.UniqueID.ToString()
    InterfaceNumber = $NetInterface.InterfaceNumber.ToString()
    InterfaceSide = $NetInterface.InterfaceSide.ToString()
    IPAddress = $NetInterface.IPAddress.ToString()
    }
    $objNetInterfaces | Add-Member -type PropertySet -Name Instance$i -Value $objNetInterface
    $i++
    }

I know this is a mess. My hope was to be able to store the information so that it could be represented and accessed like this.

$Server.NetInterfaces.Interface1.IPAddress

TL;DR: noob who wrote a script in an environment where UAC is autodisabled

It’s kinda long so here’s the link: http://pastebin.com/Q0e8Uktp
MAIN QUESTION:
I’m a PowerShell nooblet who’s trying to make my coworkers lives easier by automating our post image setup (name, and a few other things).  I was successful in achieving this but ran into a snag today when testing my script on a fresh installation of windows 7 where I forgot to disable UAC. UAC happens to be disabled per our GPO…don’t ask me why, I’m not sure if this is best practice or not. In any case the registry edits that are pretty crucial to the smooth functioning of the script get blocked when UAC is enabled and if I wanted to make my future scripts available to others who may have UAC enabled I feel like I should figure out how to fix this – even though it’s not an issue inside of my environment.

The management server does powershell commands to server ""A"" and the last step in the process is extracting data from our database server. Which works fine. But then it is supposed to export the data to Server B. Thats where it fails. If we perform this all from Server A instead of going from the management server it works. But as soon as we go from the management server we get denied from doing this on server B from management server to server A and forward to B.

There are no rights that needs to be solved as it works from Server A but not when it needs to invoke commands through another server from what I understand.

For example, of course). You can reverse the source and destination to have it save a folder full of .msg files back in the Inbox, too. Or the destination could be another mail folder in the profile, or even a .pst.

The script goes further when it outputs to the file system as .msgs. If you give it access to run LDAP queries, subject, body, attachment names and sizes, and certain dates).

It is heavily based around the Outlook COM object model

As far as I know, it started out as something simple to automate some trivial task, but it ballooned into this massive script spread across multiple modules totalling thousands of lines of code.

I'm sure there is much better ways to do what I'm trying to accomplish. So I would like to avoid scripts until I get a solid understanding of how commands work outside of a script before I start scripting. So the basic goal is to look at a domain

So far without making the command without a variable gives me:

    Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Server 'server.domain.org:3268' -SearchBase ""DC=childdomain

    Count    : 260
    Average :
    Sum      :
    Maximum:
    Minimum :
    Property :

So I figured if I only want the line that has the count

    PS C:\Users\gex&gt; $count= Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Server 'server.domain.org:3268' -SearchBase ""DC=childdomain

    PS C:\Users\gex&gt; $count | Select-String -Pattern ""count""

This returns a blank (nothing) to the screen.

But when I actually think about it

So I think what I need to figure out is how to get the results of the command into a variable. And then use:

    PS C:\Users\gex&gt; $count | Select-String -Pattern ""count""

to actually read the varible and display the line that says ""count"". Once I figure that out

I have successfully created other scheduled tasks on other servers in a similar manner so the fact that I can't figure this one out is extra frustrating.

The script that I have written uses the Cisco UCS Powertool module (CiscoUcsPS).

If I run the script manually myself it runs correctly.  If I run the script inside a session for the user the scheduled task runs as (using run as different user from the context menu) it runs successfully.

Running the scheduled tasks generates a System.Management.Automation.CommandNotFoundException from the calls to the cmdlets provided by the CiscoUcsPS module.

The script:

1374012166.0,1ifzb4,Why won't my logon script run from a Group Policy,spyingwind,5,0,22,"I couldn't find any resource(subreddit search

Domain operation Level: 2008 r2

Client: Windows 7 Pro

Problem: I created a group policy that should run one script at the user's logon. It doesn't run.

Diag so far: I have singed my script with a code signing cert from my CA. I have set execution level to allay any powershell script to run. I can run the script on the workstation just fine.

I have three methods of determining if the script ran. Two that tell me if it ran
Neither the popup pops up

If I run the script from the workstation

The GPO has the defaults plus Domain Users included in the Delegation and without

The script is ran like this from the GPO in the Scripts tab: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noexit &amp;'\\\server\NETLOGON\save-pcinfo.ps1'
I also tried running the script from the PowerShell Scripts tab
I can run my other .cmd script just fine

I have added other items in the GPO


The script is as follows:

    #variables for site
    $centLocation = ""\\server\share\login\hosts.info""
    
    #get needed info for AD
    $name = (get-wmiobject win32_OperatingSystem).__SERVER
    $serial = (Get-wmiobject win32_bios serialnumber).SerialNumber
    $model = (Get-wmiobject Win32_ComputerSystem Model).Model
    $user = (Get-ItemProperty 'hklm:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\' -Name LastLoggedOnSAMUser).LastLoggedOnSAMUser
    
    #save needed to centLocation
    Get-Content $centLocation | Where-Object {$_ -notmatch ""$serial""} | Out-File $centLocation
    $name + "","" + $model| Out-File -Append $centLocation
    
    #My Diag
    
    #make a popup
    $a = get-content env:username
    if ($a -eq ""spyingwind"")
    {
    $a = new-object -comobject wscript.shell
    $b = $a.popup(""spyingwind"",1)
    }
    
    #Make a log file
    $msg = ""$(Get-Date -format 'u'): save-pcinfo.ps1 Finished.""
    $msg | Out-File c:\temp\pcinfo.txt



Edit: updated with correct \\

Edit2: Moving the script to the Computer Config on Startup runs the script. I've tried adding Domain Users to the Policy

As a treat here is the other half of the script that runs on a schedule on a server.

    import-module ActiveDirectory
    $centLocation = ""\\server\share\login\hosts.info""
    $header = ""COMP"",""MODEL""
    $cont = (Get-Content $centLocation); $cont = $cont[0]
    
    $contH = Import-Csv $centLocation -Header $header
    Foreach ( $line in $contH ) {
    	$comp = $line.COMP
    	$serial = $line.SERI
        $user = $line.USER
        $model = $line.MODEL
        $desc = $serial + "" - "" + $user + "" - "" + $model
    	Set-ADComputer $comp -Description $desc
    }

Then I don't get any data in my csv file.  If I just do:

    get-casmailbox | export-csv activesync.csv -notype

Then my file contains a lot more columns than is just output with get-casmailbox (when output to the terminal).

So the problem

I quickly discovered that if I executed the following in command line

    C:\Program Files\application\unins000.exe /Silent

So I wrote a quick script in PS to attempt to perform this action

Here's the script:

    $servers = Get-Content serverlist.txt
    $command = &amp; ""C:\Program Files\app\unins000.exe"" /Silent
    
    foreach($server in $servers){
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {$command}}

That's pretty much the bulk of the issue at hand

I had a PS Shell open on my own workstation and this string worked perfectly for me:

    &amp; ""C:\Program Files\app\unins000.exe"" /Silent

But go and throw it in the above and nothing was working :-/

    powershell -noprofile -c ""&amp; %PSFILE%"" &gt;&gt; %location%\logs\%logFIle% 2&gt;&amp;1 

However

	$bindingFlags = [Reflection.BindingFlags] “Instance

	$bindingFlags = [Reflection.BindingFlags] “Instance

	$field = $consoleHost.GetType().GetField(“standardOutputWriter”
	$field.SetValue($consoleHost
	$field2 = $consoleHost.GetType().GetField(“standardErrorWriter”
	$field2.SetValue($consoleHost

Then I generally handle writing to a ""log"" by just letting stuff fall through the pipe to write-output

    ""$(Get-Date -f 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss') INFO | DOING SOMETHING""

I really like this because it handles any errors I might forget to grab in a `try/catch/fail`. 

**However**

Take the following example of code that would cause issues:

    $disksToUse = Foreach ($disk in $disks) {
	if ($archiveLocationsRoots -contains $disk.DeviceID)
	{
		$diskTotal += $disk.Freespace
		
		$percentageFreeSpace = ($disk.FreeSpace / $disk.Size)
		if ($percentageFreeSpace -le 0.95)
		{
			(Get-Date -f ""yyyMMdd-HHmmss"") + "" WARNING! The amount of free space in $($disk.DeviceID) is only $percentageFreeSpace - $($disk.FreeSpace/1024/1024/1024) GB free of $($disk.Size/1024/1024/1024) GB total.""
		} else {
			(Get-Date -f ""yyyMMdd-HHmmss"") + "" The amount of free space in $($disk.DeviceID) is $percentageFreeSpace - $($disk.FreeSpace/1024/1024/1024) GB free of $($disk.Size/1024/1024/1024) GB total.""
		}
		$disk | Select *
	}

The alternative would be to re-write the application logic to perform another query against the returned data *afterwards*.

**I realize** that common solutions are to use `Start-Transcript` or using a custom `Write-ToLogFile` that just uses `Set-Content -Append`. However

These executables seem to be poorly written in that

For example:

    .\symclone.exe -g $groupName -establish $sourceDevice sym ld $targetDevice -noprompt

Returns:

    symclone.exe :

    'Incremental Establish' operation successfully initiated for device 'SourceDevice' in group 'DeviceGroup' paired with target device 'TargetDevice'.

This is perfectly expected and running as normal.  Unfortunately the tool has been written to throw an error for this.  Even worse: this is not consistent. Another executable from the same set of tools will output the result to Standard Output.  

My dilemma is how to best handle this from PowerShell since I then need to parse the return string to check it's doing what I want.  

My current solution involves using *Start-Process* with *-RedirectStandardError* and *-RedirectStandardOutput* to output to a text file (these switches don't allow output to variables).  I then check both of the text files and do my RegEx on the contents to check what the executable has done.

I've given myself a project to help me learn but I'm stuck on the test-path command. What I want to do is check multiple locations to see if a file exists and return a true or false value. Ideally

The only real example I can give is what i've already got for testing whether computers are online

    $names = Get-Content ""C:\temp\testcomputers.txt""
    foreach ($name in $names) {
    if ( Test-Connection -ComputerName $name -Count 1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue ) {

1365172751.0,1bqgoi,ACL Audit Script Against DFS Too Hungry For Server and Still Runs For Days,tarsix,5,2,7,"Below is my script that I have been working on for auditing ACLs on our DFS shares

All servers are 08R2.  The server the script runs from is a VM with an allocated 16GB RAM and 4 X5680 Intel Xeon processors at 3.33 Ghz.  The script runs fine, piping the directories directly through a foreach-object loop, and a couple other simple things.  It also takes forever to run.  Most of the DFS shares we are auditing have roughly 50k folders and the script will run for days, keeping the server memory pegged the whole time.  In addition, and this is really tangential but worth mentioning, it does nothing to address the wonderful character limit for processing files / folders.  Anyway, I have been beating my head against a wall for a little while now, so I am appealing to this community for help.  Thanks in advance!

Sorry If I seem like one of those people who just needs someone to write some code for them really quick

Here is my problem. I have been given a spreadsheet .xlsx file with a list of over 600 user names and information. Column A has last names

Basically
A) searches for each user on file and imports logon name next to it
B) pulls a list of all account information from the users account and I just remove the columns that I do not need. 

I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/related/13sgwf/looking_for_some_help_in_getting_powershell_to/) thread that matches a little about what I want to do.

1356644853.0,15jel9,Question about working with objects,powerthrowaway1,6,2,7,"I am in the process of creating an initialization script I can use across multiple scripts.  The current idea for the config script is to have it craft a custom object containing important directories

I have the object setup like so:  

     $obj   #parent object
     $obj.config  #Child Configuration object
     $obj.config.dir #Containts all relavent directories 
     $obj.config.dir.function #Contains powershell function locations (ie.AD
     $obj.config.exe #Contains all external executable files (TODO: Paramaters?)
     $obj.config.dc.(parent
     $obj.config.email #contain distribtion lists

This works fine so far

     function add-Exe(){
     $exe = New-Object system.Object

     $exe | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name ""Psexec"" -Value ($obj.dir.programs + ""\sysinternals\psexec.exe"")

     return $exe
     }

     $config | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name ""exe"" -value $(add-exe) 

So my question:  Is there a way to enumerate my $config.exe object to return all subproperties and test their UNC values? 
I am currently trying variations of:
 
      #Test external executable paths
      $config.exe | %{$exe = $_ ;#Test for executables
      if((Test-Path $exe) -eq $false){$warningObj += ""Not Found: $exe .`n""}
      Clear-Variable exe
      }
 The idea is to send an email to a group letting them know if any parts of this initialization script fail.

I have a small script that I created which I intend to use with my Nagios monitoring system (in combination with NSClient++/check_nrpe) on a client PC end

Goals of the script:  

 * accept command line variable input for url, domain, search string, warning and crit times.
 * return some help text if any of the required variables are missing
 * load the given website
 * grab a timestamp before and after loading the webpage
 * look at the returned webpage for the given text string
 * provide Nagios friendly results (ie a short sentence about the status and an exit code of 0/1/2/3/4 for OK/Warning/Critical/Unknown status)

If I get it working properly and well enough


The Script...

    &lt;#
    .SYNOPSIS
    This Powershell script was created for use with nsclient++/check_nrpe/nagios in order to check the load time of a given website. It currently only uses NTLM authentication.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    The script accepts input parameters for URL, login domain, search string, crit and warn times. It uses .net's web client functionality in order to grab the given page.
    
    It grabs the system timestamp immediately before and after getting the page in order to calculate how long it took to execute that bit.  It then looks at the returned page and searches for the given text string.
    
    If it takes too long to load the page
    
    .EXAMPLE
    
    Script: 
    check_site.ps1 -url ""http://intranet.contoso.com"" -user ""tuser"" -pass ""Reset123"" -dom ""contoso"" -find ""hello"" -w 2 -c 6

The above piece of code works but this is where I get stuck. Now If I replace “-ge” with “-eq” it returns nothing. No matter how accurately I add the parameter for createTime it does not return a value if check for equality.

    gci -path H:\ -r -filter *exe | where-object{$_.CreationTime -eq ""07/18/2013 16:25:40""} - Returns nothing

Another very confusing  aspect is that it displays the date as dd/mm/yy when I call get-date or creationTime but only takes mm/dd/yy as input.
As you can see below although calling CreateTime (as seen inabove) returns 18/07/2013 4:25:40 p.m. it wants 07/18/2013 16:25:40 as input.

Recently ran across an issue where a certain application can chew up an entire core on a XenApp server.  Not something you want happening for a business critical application with thousands of users.  The real solution

Boe Prox provided a [helpful post](http://learn-powershell.net/2010/11/01/quick-hit-find-currently-logged-on-users/) on the topic covering the drawbacks of WMI, and if I could get away with dependencies I would have stuck with that.

So!  It looks like the best way to pull this data is query user.  Boe already provided code for parsing query session, let's split each line into strings!  This won't work either.  Certain fields will occasionally contain no data.  Fortunately, a combination of the two methods does the trick (according to my initial testing).  We parse by substrings if the line length is 82.  If the line length is greater than this, we parse by arrays.

The result is a quick query for the following info on one or more computers: ComputerName, Id, State, IdleTime, LogonTime

Please note that you may need to configure your environment for this to work.  You will need query.exe (you probably have this already), or wrap it up in a function for a module, profile, or script you run.

Side note:  Does anyone know what the format is for Idle Time?  . means less than a minute.  Most values are readable...

I keep my end users locked out of admin so they don't break things. One of our clients pushes update to our server that then has to update individual computers next time the program runs. This fails because the end users are not admin.

They give me &lt;4 hours notice every update (every other month).  So I don't feel bad about the client breaking their own system everytime they push an update and communicate poorly. But I am getting tired of manually making the program run as local admin after they push a surprise update. So I decided to throw together a quick command line to run it remotely with admin creds. While I was putting it together I thought

So I was thinking since I am complete novice to powershell

A: Is this a good way to use power shell.
B: Is this how someone else might approach it.


As far as getting it together I see it as 2 parts.

Get a csv of the computers I want to have this run against (and it is a mix of ~200 machines ~50% have the program and 50% don't)

Run powershell against that CSV doing a get WMIobject to find installed programs [link](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/11/13/use-powershell-to-quickly-find-installed-software.aspx)

Take the output of that and pass down computers that have specific installed program.

Launch program using credentials for local admin.

The program will then fire up on all machines listed in the CSV that met requirements.

Write results back to CSV.


The only other way I am thinking to get this working is maybe read directly from OU instead of bothering with a CSV.

Is this a good way to utilize PowerShell or would I be better off falling back on VBS or just going with a command line. 

Is there a better way to do what I am thinking about doing then how I outlined it?

Please also submit a printout of your file (format it in Excel so that the text in each column prints in full).""

**EDIT1** I figured out the answer to my question. For those wondering. it is a two part deal. part 1 is the creation of the oU which can be done using CSVDE. using the cmd csvde -i -f ""filename"" will inject the OU to the root domain.

* For each drive remaining I use robocopy to ""move"" the files to a scratch folder on the Z:\.
* Zip up the files and then delete the scratch folder.

\* the reason I say ""move"" is because that's exactly where I'm running into a problem.   The script runs and does pretty much everything I want except that it doesn't remove the original files from the share it just copies them and leaves the original in place.

1361320909.0,18ur2h,Runs in ISE no problem. Task scheduler will not insert a variable into Send-MailMessage body. Show me the error of my ways,SoundManCO,4,1,7,"As the title says. When I run the code below in ISE it inserts the variable into the email body. When I run the same script with the task scheduler (win2k8R2) everything works except the variable in the email body is omitted. 

In the task actions tab I specify powershell.exe in the program/script and put the fill path to this script in the Add arguments. I tried using -Noninteractive

I am really stumped as to why it works if I load it up in ISE but that variable will not insert into the email when run with the task scheduler.

One of my problems is that some of these VMs occasionally encounter a problem where the Stop-VM command hangs due to something going on within the VM -- I've had this happen on a Windows XP VM I've been testing with, so I can't rely on errors to tell me what's going on.

As such, here: I can use Start-Job, put my stop-vm command in a script block, and add a Wait-Job/Stop-Job, then evaluate whether or not the job was completed or if it was stopped prematurely. This works great -- in test cases.

Trouble is, theoretically) is not accessible by the job.

Here's the snippet of code I was trying :

    Start-Job -name stop -ScriptBlock {
        if(Stop-VM -Name $vmname) {
            Write-EventLog -LogName Scripts -Source VMBackup -EntryType Information -EventId 2201 -Message ""$vmName stopped successfully."";

        }
    }
    Wait-Job -name stop -Timeout 300; #if stopping the VM takes longer than five minutes
    Stop-Job -name stop;


What I want to do is then evaluate whether or not the command within the job was successful, skip the current VM and move to the next (a continue in my foreach). I can accomplish that easily enough, even without passing data back out of the job -- just check my most recent event log entry, or check $error[0], or something. No problem.

But since I can't pass variables into my job

    Start-Job -name stop -InputObject $vmname -ScriptBlock { whatever }

And I know that, not $vmname. But this results in $input being empty, it seems -- my event log gets this entry in it: "" failed to stop: ...""

I've also tried $($input) instead of just $input

Several months ago I wrote a script to connect to Exchange 2007 (SP1) and monitor my mailbox. It's been working perfectly until a couple of days ago. After spending the best part of 12 hours on it

The problem: Upon connection to Exchange
` Exception calling ""Bind"" with ""2"" argument(s): ""The request failed. The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.""

And this is what I have. WebServices.dll is version 14.3.67.1 (originally was 14.3.32.0). Remember that it worked fine for months

    Add-Type -Path ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange\Web Services\1.2\Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Dll"" -ErrorAction Stop

    $service.Url = New-Object Uri(""https://my-exchange-server/EWS/Exchange.asmx"")
    $inbox = [Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.Folder]::Bind($service


As soon as the Bind method is called I get the error. Much Googling led me to references to:

I have been using the following script to generate a report and mail it every Monday:

I need to include the Primary SMTP Address now. I have tried shoehorning in the PrimarySMTPAddress attribute right after the DisplayName attribute to have it display along side the mailbox name in the report

I can run a script that just says:

Can anybody help point out what I am leaving out here?

This is my first attempt at a Powershell script. It was an interview question (sort of like homework) and I have no idea what the 'grading scale' was. I already submitted my work to the manager but wanted to see how y'all thought I did. Here was the prompt:

Scenario:
There is a critical file that needs to be backed up throughout the day to protect against possible corruption.  Build a PowerShell script to copy a file from one folder to another and implement a required file retention policy.  The source file data will change over time.

Setup:
-	Create a folder c:\PowerShell
-	Create a folder c:\PowerShell\Source
-	Create a folder c:\PowerShell\Backup
-	Create a source text file with a few lines of random text within as c:\PowerShell\Source\Source.txt

Requirements:

-	The script will run on the same computer the source file and destination files are located on.
-	The script will be run manually from PowerShell.
-	Each time the script is run
-	Over time
-	The script should only create files If run between the hours of 6 AM and Midnight.
-	Implement a logging function to write your script’s activity to c:\PowerShell\Backup\Log.txt

Deliverables:

-	Phase 1:

o	Sketch out a flowchart showing the proposed logic of your script.  Use “pseudo code” to describe processes that occur (you don’t have to know syntax).
o	Create test cases to use for the following phases.
o	Review with me before continuing.

-	Phase 2:

o	Create the folders and files in the setup section.
o	Begin to code your script.  At this phase
o	Show me that this runs and meets your test cases created for this phase.

-	Phase 3:

o	Implement the time restrictions in your script (6AM to Midnight)
o	Implement the file overwrite logic in your script (do not overwrite if file is less than 23 hours old)

-	Phase 4:

o	Implement the logging function.
o	Log the following to c:\PowerShell\Backup\Log.txt
	The date and time the script starts
	The file it will attempt to generate
	If the file exists in the backup directory
	Whether or not the file will be overwritten
o	The log file should only maintain information for the current calendar day.

Examples (Phase 3 Complete):

-	Script is run at 1:48 PM
o	Script copies file as Source1345.txt
-	Script is run at 8:48 AM
o	Script overwrites file Source0845.txt with data currently in source.txt
-	Script is run at 11:32 AM
o	Script does not copy the file
-	Script is run at 4:15 AM
o	Script does not copy the file

Turns out that this only works if you are using Microsoft System Centre with the relevant add-ins (which we do not have). The other option is to use the following:

    $result = $VMManagementService.CreateVirtualSystemSnapshot($SourceVm) 

This doesn't work as the Virtualization namespace does not exist on the machine that I want to run the script from (and the CreateVirtualSystemSnapshot method also). It only exists on machines where HyperV is installed, if need be).

I'm having trouble beginning a powershell script. Here's my problem I'm trying to solve via the script:

I have an old piece of software with bad file association. If I click on a file

* Associate the file extension to the script
* Have the script pull the referenced file location
* Modify the registry with this new file location (for the software to open to)
* Open the original application

Would something like this work? I'm only trying to fix the file association here to actually open the file within the application and not have to manually complete this action.

Thanks for the help!

When joining a machine via GUI the machine joins correctly and is listed in AD as pcname123.site1.foo.bar.com.

When I use
    Add-Computer -domainname foo.bar.com -credentials foo\domainadmin

The machine initially appears correctly but once the machine reboots the DnsHostName record changes to pcname123.foo.bar.com.

This results in users not being able to login until the attribute is changed via gui or set-qadcomputer.

I am working on a few scripts and need to output to the screen

ex:

Function DoSomeStuff {  
 Try {  
        Do some stuff....

 Catch{

} #end of do some stuff
