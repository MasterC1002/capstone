This was at Blizzcon 2011.  Yeah I play WoW.

When I started the actual juicing diet I got myself down to about 370/380.  I am not good at documenting but here is a pic of june 15 2012

http://i.imgur.com/OctLcgT.jpg


Now juicing wasn't easy.  I was really really hungry after the first 5 days.  I decided to incorporate 1 cheat day per week.  But even then my stomach was so use to the juice i would puke my cheat day food so I had to take it easy even then.  Sometimes I would take an entire week and basically eat subway and think ITS OK THIS FOOTLONG IS LOW CALORIE

Best part about it was I felt GREAT and still feel amazing.  After those 45 days I started to just eat good foods.  Nuts, chicken, brown rice, everything whole wheat.  And before you know it I was down to about 290 pounds after 3-4months!

Well today I am at 267 and here are some nice after pics.

Now for juicing! My favorite combo has always been

2 kale leaves
2 celery sticks
2 apples
10 green grapes
1 swiss shard leaf
half inch of ginger
4 broccoli heads
2 bokchoy leaves

This gives me most energy and leaves me nice and full ALL THE TIME.  I could drink this every damn day.

And I also take Mega Man Vitamins! Big thanks to this juicing community who continues to provide awesome information for guys like me who are basically dumb when it comes to nutrition

Over the past five years

* 2006 - 1 day
* 2007 - 7 days
* 2009 - 100 days
* 2011 - 200 days
* 2012 - 1 year

Initially, the benefits were so favorable that I decided to extend the duration of each subsequent trial. Currently, I pretty much view myself a juicarian. When not juicing, I am a 100% raw vegan. I haven't made any firm commitments regarding juicing after 2012 concludes. If things go as great as they are going now, I may continue.

The positive benefits of long term juicing have been greater than I could have ever hoped...

* I am turning 40 this year but physically I feel like I did when I was 10.
* My immune system is rock solid. I am completely free of illness/disease.
* I am in the best shape of my life. I no longer drive a car and cover 7000-8000 miles by bicyle annually (for much of the year through rain
* I effortlessly maintain a very svelte and fit body.
* I consume as much juice as I desire and I never feel hungry or deprived.
* Blood pressure, resting heart rate and body fat are all at lifetime lows.
* The practice and self-discipline of juicing has massively strengthened my will power
* My mental clarity and creative abilities are astonishing.
* At this point into the year

I make sporadic updates on my Facebook page [which can be found here.](http://www.yearofjuice.com)

I also maintain a [Google Docs spreadsheet of my stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArN6FrogqLQvdExaUG9Tc0hmaVgwZDV5X1FwajBVT0E). I am sometimes a day to two behind on this before I transfer my handwritten notes to the online spreadsheet.

I decided to do a juice fast because when I watched ""Fat, the fat, unhappy guy that basically sits around for hours on end for work and not making any progress save that toward death.

So I decided that I was going to change much the same way he did. I was determined to do all the things that I've been saying I want to do for so long

I bought a Breville Juice Fountain

One issue I had when I started was the scale only went to 440 pounds and I erred it out

How'd I do? This morning I weighed in at 355

I haven't noticed any acid reflux since the second night or so. I'm sleeping better than ever and don't have crashes anymore.

Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/01byz) showing what my face looked like on day 0 and today, I just want to do it for myself really and when I get where I want to be, then I'll share it with everyone. I also have body shots but I have a few identifying tattoos and would prefer to not have my identity publicized until I get where I want to be. (Not that I'm known yet, but someday hopefully.)

Here's a [shot](http://imgur.com/2HUlU) of my weight chart and my intermediary goals

What now? I'm glad that I have juicing in my bag of tricks now and know that, reevaluate my relationship with food. I think I'm going to go towards a ketogenic diet for the foreseeable future, I had great success with it before, but never examined my relationship with food when I was younger so after I had reached my lowest adult weight, I reverted to terrible decisions and ended up at my highest adult weight.

So why did I start juicing and doing juice fasts? What are the actual observable benefits? Easy:

1. I am fat. I want to lose weight. Other attempts have failed.
2. I have a poor diet
3. I suffer from various conditions which may aggravated by weight and diet.
4. Vegetables *definitely do* help prevent serious diseases
5. Juicing is the fastest and easiest way to eat a ton of fresh fruits and veggies.
6. Calorie restriction (fasting) is proven to be effective at helping you live longer, improve memory, etc.
7. Modern medicine has extended our life span FAR more than poor diet can shorten it

1354568503.0,147xn5,Juicing as meal replacement.  It doesn't have to be all or nothing.,willtel76,30,2,8,"I have been juicing as a breakfast and lunch meal replacement 5 days a week since Father's day and I feel like it has been a success.  Before juicing I would skip breakfast and usually eat some type of fast food combo meal for lunch and then have a normal meat and potatoes home cooked dinner.  

Since about August I have been preparing 32oz. of juice and drinking it Monday through Friday and eating a normal dinner in the evenings and normally on the weekends.  In addition to juicing as a meal replacement I have cut out all snacking and I no longer drink soft drinks

My typical recipe includes the following:

* 3-4 kale leaves
* 4-5 stalks of celery
* two whole carrots
* two small granny smith apples
* a handful of flat leaf parsley
* a chunk of ginger
* one beet
* one peeled lemon
* one whole cucumber

It isn't the tastiest blend but I'm not doing this for pleasure.  I will say that the lemon is key

I typically drink a cup of coffee in the morning with sugar and half &amp; half then have 16ozs of juice around 11:30am.  (I've never been much on breakfast)  Around 3:30-4:00pm I will finish off the rest of the juice then I have a normal meal with my family at around 7:30-8:00pm.  This works well for me becuase I don't get hungry during the day and I still have a *real* meal to look forward to each day.  The first few weeks were difficult as I would be ravaged around 6:30pm but that has subsided.  I also now find it much easier to control my portions when eating solid food.  I used to be a two full plates at dinner type of guy but now I eat a more normal sized portion and feel satisfied.

[This is a graph of my weight since Aug. 17th.](http://i.imgur.com/jHTA6.jpg)  After returning from a vacation in late July I was at a peak 247lbs.  The two distinct peaks in the graph coincide with the week after my daughter's 1st birthday in late August and the week after Halloween.  Eating sweets and candy don't help this effort and it shows on the graph where I cheated.

I just wanted to toss this out there and let others know that you don't have to fast to lose weight and feel better with juicing.  You can do a partial diet change and see results while still eating foods you enjoy and spending meal time with your family.

Had the same attitude the last two days as I had after Day 7. I was ready for it to be over and to start the next chapter. Time to get serious about my diet. After soccer I went home and had a beer and contemplated what I would eat. My roommates were chowing down on some fast food Mexican and I really had no desire to partake. I was eying the big bowl of fruit on the table. It's amazing how my taste preference has changed. The beers left a bad taste in my mouth. I know that every once and a while I can indulge

I also want to get my running routine...well up and running. I'm curious to see if a vegetable heavy diet will provide the sustenance I need to run multiple miles per day. Once I get the juice/solid food ratio figured out I'll get back into the gym to do some lifting.

I want to take the time to thank the people who have posted reply messages. It really helped me to keep going on this short fast. 10 days doesn't sound like much but I have seen a lot of change in that short time. I encourage anyone who has been curious

- On Sept 10th, I broke my fast.  They say you are supposed to ease out of a cleanse by transitioning with salads/vegetables/lean meats, etc.  I didn't do that...I jumped right into the bad food, which was a mistake.  Here's what I had:

- A small personal flatbread pizza (didn't eat the whole thing)
- A couple bites of white cake
- 1 mozzarella stick
- 1 potato skin
- No alcohol; had about 4 glasses of water because I was so thirsty!

- I shouldn't have ate all that food without a transition.  The cake tasted awful

- Side effects: Headache, greasy film in mouth.  VERY puffy eyes the next day (probably because of all the sodium).  I want to go back to the juice...  I did get lots of compliments on how I looked.

###Day 11: Sept 11 (Sun.)

- ....10:30am - 20oz freshly juiced fresh organic orange juice.  :-)
- Juiced the whole day
- Dinner: Edamame

- My plan is to integrate healthy foods into the juicing.  Will probably continue to drink 2-3 juices a day.  I feel great!   ",self,t5_2s602,1357785781.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/16affz/a_little_over_a_year_ago_i_did_a_10_day_juice/

 When I first decided to do this I just wanted to drink the mean green the entire time
So I have granny smith apples, cucumbers, celery, carrots, kale, ginger root, grapefruit, grapes

One thing I've been concerned with is losing all the skin off of the food, or depressed that I cannot have food. But then my husband told me today, ""It's not that you cannot have food, you can have all the food you want, but you won't"" and that made me feel really happy, and very proud.

I told my husband if at the end of day 15 I want to keep going, he basically said for me that would not be healthy. I know that this is the right thing for me to do, happier life because of this.

So to start easy I made a breakfast juice of strawberries, celery, carrots as a base (common to both her and my juice). I love grapefruit and she doesn‚Äôt so I kept the grapefruit to the side until I completed her portion; mixed the juice thoroughly and separated her portion; then juiced my grapefruit into my remaining portion.

I also noticed that she liked her juices chilled for longer periods of time so I ended up grabbing the old blender and filling it half with ice and then pouring the portion of her juice in the blender; setting it to a low ‚Äòstir‚Äô and it crushed all the ice up making a super frosty juice (quite slushy-like).

Two things, I felt I guess foggy and unclear during them, but after that amazing. I guess I'm worried I've done something wrong. Fat Sick and Nearly Dead made me think the first few days were worse than death.

Next, so I juice a bit, then it's gone for hours and hours. Generally I try and drink 3 20oz bottles a day, but I found myself drinking my morning juice, sipping it between 9-11A, and not wanting to even think about eating again till 4 of 5.

Could I start throwing some whey powder into my juices for protein or is going the keto route after next week when my fast ends a better option now that more muscle sculpting is my next goal.

Then around 4:30pm, No thanks I bought mine at $111.54.

Update: sounds like it was Amazons fault. I basically let them off the hook. They gave me $25 off a j8003. It's later now

I'm writing this a little over halfway through the day but I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I feel really great. Now this could be a combination of a great day of work, but I will give juicing a little bit of the credit. All I want to do is go run! Unfortunately I don't think there will be time for the jog today but I hope to put this energy to good use tomorrow mid day.

I was beginning to lose sight of why I wanted to juice in the first place. I got a little distracted by the weight loss and I hovered around the 155 mark the last few days and got disappointed. What is most important is to cleanse and to retrain my palette for a mostly veg diet. I watched a pretty good documentary called Vegucated about 3 people going vegan for 6 weeks. Some of the numbers they were showing were a bit suspect but overall it was an interesting watch and and got me thinking about a vegetable based diet.

I haven't talked about it yet but I wanted to touch on my supplement regiment I also started during the fast. I've been taking an Omega-3, it was enough for me to start experimenting with it.

That all being said. Day 6 has been a success. I'm crossing my fingers that the whole week brings me high energy and clear thought. If you're in the first half of a 10 day fast (or longer) keep it up!

Juicing 101

No exercise necessary (thought it certainly helps)

SUPPLIES

Go out and buy THREE 1-gallon jugs. I went to the dollar store and got these pitcher things for $2.50/ea. Dollar store my ass.
My old roommate also bought 3 nalgenes because he brought the individual meal sizes to work; I just brought the whole gallon jug. You may want to grab one or two for times when juicing will be tougher/less convenient (AKA on the road). Believe me

Buy this juicer for $60: http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Mouth-Extractor-67650/dp/B000FHQJ6C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349186645&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hamilton+beach+big+mouth+juice+extractor

Buy a stiff bristle brush for cleaning your juicer. I just went to the kitchen soap aisle at target and got one for like

THE RECIPE (or

Note: you may have to adjust this. I buy kale in bags, this should cost somewhere around $22. Try and hit up the farmers market for some stuff. 

Also note: This is configured to my tastes. I love the taste of this recipe, experiment with other recipes. Look online. Also, you can mess with this. Don't like the tomato taste? Don't put em in! But replace it with, say, another cucumber. Or with bell peppers. Or with beets. Onion. Garlic. Etc.

2lbs Carrots

1 whole bunch celery

2 Large Cucumbers

5-6 Roma Tomatoes

1 large yellow squash

4 Large Oranges

3 Large Lemons

2 thumb size pieces of whole ginger root (fresh)

1 Bag Spinach

1 Bag Kale

THE PREPARATION

You do not need to wash or peel any of the veggies

Put a plastic grocery bag in the pulp hopper. This aids in clean up!
Thats it.

THE JUICING

Juice 1/2 of the Kale, juice the whole thing. This recipe follows standard sizes of items I can get at the market next to me), Celery, Tomatoes, and Ginger (IN THAT ORDER). Just put everything in whole. Have one of your gallon jugs by the juicer, as you'll need to empty the hopper into it periodically. Once you juice the ginger, you'll need to clean your juice-basket (since the ginger's so fibrous

Clean the juice basket filter thing with the brush you bought. Empty the pulp hopper. Put new grocery bag in hopper.

Juice the remaining ingredients. I juice the cucumbers last since they're so juicy they seem to rinse the juicer out - and bring the rest of the other juice with it.

Clean your juicer IMMEDIATELY afterwards. I just rinse it off of all pulp and crap. Once every couple weeks, so be careful.

DRINKING THAT SHIT

I drink two large (22oz) glasses for each meal
In the beginning if you start to feel weak

After my first couple weeks
Also, I would count out 10-15 almonds, put away the bag and eat those. The fats in the almonds took away hunger pains.

Coffee is fine as long as its black. I found that diet soda threw off my weight loss
DRINK TONS OF WATER. I used to drink a liter when i got in to work, and I tried to get one in before I left every day. It helps.

Odd notes about juicing: you'll fell a lot healthier. It was weird

Cost per meal is between $6-8. Buy in bulk when you can. Spinach

Juice will last about 3-4 days, so I guess its fine (But - KEEP REFRIGERATED)

1333548795.0,rsvze,It finally happened guys - my juicer died on the 70th day of its life. :(,israel_torres,16,2,17,When I first started my 60 day juice fast I picked up the [GE 800 Watt Fruit Juice Extractor $49.96](http://www.walmart.com/ip/GE-Juice-Extractor/12311470)... today is my 10th (hybrid) day after my successful 60 day juice fast (hence 70th day) and this morning while I was making my morning juice the motor started to sound very slow and then a puff of smoke came out of the bottom of the juicer and the motor seized! (I ran to open the windows and turn on the fan so that the smoke alarm wouldn't trigger) had about half a bowl of produce to juice but already made 8 cups - I had to put the other prepared produce in a plastic container. It was a sad moment though the motor started to sound weird last night making my evening juice - it must have been the death knell. I plan to get another one today - I'm also planning to get the same one as it served me quite well for my fast and I used it everyday just about 3 times a day. If it fails early I'll certainly consider to upgrade to something else; but it is hard to beat 50 bucks (if you calculate it that's less than a dollar a day for 70 days of its life). I'd really love to get a high end juicer but financially I don't think now is the time do invest hundreds of dollars (even with a multi-year warrant).,t5_2s602,True

So I'm female

I went to the doctor a few months ago for a yearly checkup.  I took a blood test and she told me that I was seriously deficient in almost every vitamin category and I was so low in iron

It just so happened I got my tax refund the next week and so I did some research and bought an Omega VERT350HD masticating juicer.  I picked that one as I have a tiny kitchen and this was seemingly the best of the upright juicers.  It does a great job juicing

I'm not really wanted to state my starting weight but my starting BMI was an ugly 40.7. 

The first few days were tough, I've ordered salad.  I also didn't give up coffee with my dollop of 2% milk in the morning.   I can only go so far so fast.. baby steps.    My doctor also recommend Vital Health Green Vibrant Powder until my vitamin levels are up.  It's expensive, alas, but I'm just making it a part of my food budget.  It tastes like... grass.. but has a shit ton of vitamins, pro-biotics  and a bunch of other stuff.. does it work? I don't know if it's hogwash or not, but if my doctor recommends it, it's probably not hurting.  I find it most easy to get down with my morning carrot/appple juice.  I have more vegetables in the evening and it just makes it taste even MORE vegetable like.  

After 2 weeks, actually.   

I will continue to post updates as they happen and I'm glad to have found this community of friendly and supportive folks.  Thank you to everyone who helps each other out here.  I've been following along and really like the supportive atmosphere.

1328376846.0,pascc,Day 10 :),israel_torres,15,1,12,"Here‚Äôs some interesting data and was wondering if this is unique to me or common among other juice fasters... 

I am on the morning of Day 10 [of 60] and skipped my evening feeding (aka dinner) for my afternoon feeding (aka lunch) I had consumed 4.0 cups of veggie-fruit mix and for the morning feeding (aka breakfast) I had 2.5 cups. (I also had one BM yesterday afternoon after the feeding). 

I figured I‚Äôd be hungry when I awoke this morning or low on energy but I‚Äôm still not feeling any affects of either being on a fast or skipping feeding times. As an experiment (for science) I am going to skip my morning feeding this morning (where I would normally have at least 2 cups [higher fruit than veggie ratio]). However I‚Äôll prepare a 4.0 cups for my afternoon feeding when I go out or to have immediately if I feel anything weird (like headache

Even though I am making sure that I am not consuming more than 10.5 cups each day. I‚Äôve noticed that it doesn‚Äôt appear that I need to be consuming more than half that each day. I am interested to find out the limit line for me as it would also save on money if I am currently overeating. I calculated both on wolfram alpha and manually that I started out consuming around 600 calories a day (to where before the fast I was consuming around 5000 calories per day!!!) [when I started the fast I was 272#

I certainly don‚Äôt recommend new folks attempt this but I am just recording this so that I know my own limits and can tailor this period of juice fasting for my specific unique body.

Here's my typical juice meal (2 - 3 times a day)

* 6 celery sticks

* 5 carrots

* 2 apples

* 1 orange

* 1 tomato

= 3.5 Cups (28oz) of juice! 

I also drink black coffee but don't seem to have any of the issues that others have. 

During these 6 days I haven't experienced any type of headaches or hunger pangs

What started this whole event was that a few cow-workers decided to weigh each other and then a few of us bet that we could lose a total percentage more than the rest. Only 3 serious players (including myself) decided to bet 100$. So far I've taken the elite lead. March 25th is the final weigh in and I see myself definitely ahead of the game and a lot healthier to boot. (win-win) The hilarious part is one of the vested players told me about this juicing fast to his chagrin. ;)

Hoping to inspire friends and family by being the proof of my endeavors. :D

Not sure why I didn‚Äôt learn about this sooner; or why the whole world isn‚Äôt doing this.

**tl;dr:**

* Made bet with co-workers on most percentage weight loss.

* Watched Fat Sick and Nearly Dead by Joe Cross on Netflix

* Bought a cheap GE juice extractor at Walmart

* Dropping weight like nobody‚Äôs business and getting healthier and feeling better!

Here at the end of my first official week of juicing, and as of today, starting to feel confident enough to experiment a little.

It was Mean Green and me all day today for four servings. At dinner I had been really looking forward to trying [this recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1fjg8q/amazing_recipe/) from /u/pakriika, kale and me need to learn to get a long. So while at the store, I purchased some kale and some spinach. In the spirit of compromise, I adjusted u/papriika's drink by replacing lemon with lime, adding some tabasco, a couple of stalks of celery and a leaf of kale. And it was delicious. Surprisingly, it is more of a green drink than a tomato based drink, but delicious and satisfying none the less. So I am calling it a Green Bloody Mary.

Now sit down and let's talk (pun intended unfortunately). Before I started this, but I am a little surprised to tell you, nay warn you, just because you aren't chewing doesn't mean your body doesn't want to show things the exit door. And when it does, it isn't joking around. 

I have read of peoples experiences with constipation when they are juice fasting. I have had none of that. Quite the opposite actually. And this is a pleasant surprise. It leads me to believe my body knows exactly what it is doing and is using this opportunity to spring clean. this flesh machine we ride around is in a miraculous and wondrous thing.",self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1fp328/juice_fast_day_7_its_time_to_talk_aboutbms/

Hello Juicers! I've been lurking here for a bit and had some questions for you folks

Quick bio: 30 year old male, then really stopped a month ago. I avoid the obvious traps like white bread and such, and I try to be good about checking labels. I've decided it's time to really, really get serious about being in the best condition I can for my wife and kids. 

So my questions to you

* If you are / were a caffeine junky like me (I do love my morning coffee) how did you handle the withdrawls the first few days?

* Was there really a noticeable impact on your energy levels? I'm fine with juicing more to keep my energy up

* Do you have any regrets about it? Do you wish you'd gone longer? Shorter?

* What would you have done differently if you could do it again?

* Did you track anything? How so? Would you?

Thanks for taking the time to answer whatever might apply to you! I fully intend to post a follow-up with progress and updates!

The first two days really sucked; seeing and smelling everything that my wife cooked would irritate me. Luckily, er, *different* were the occasional explanations to someone who didn't know what I was doing and needed some sort of explanation (houseguests, family, et cetera).

Generally, [here](http://www.juicefastrecipes.net/), and, of course, [Israel Torres'](/u/israel_torres) [blog](http://blog.theproofisinthejuice.org/blog/recipes) were very helpful in breaking the monotony of drinking juice every day. For lazy days or weekends when I wanted to sleep in a bit, I would buy R. W. Knuden [Very Veggie](http://www.rwknudsenfamily.com/products/natural-juices/very-veggie-organic) or [Lemon Ginger Echinacea](http://www.rwknudsenfamily.com/products/simply-nutritious/lemon-ginger-echinacea) juice. I'm not sure if this counts as cheating, but if it does, and a relatively rare one.

With my wife's support, as it turned out to be a [*terrible*](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4G2ptSlZZn0/SZMpFiNnYKI/AAAAAAAACN0/8Hrga0w3osc/s400/PeePeeWall.jpg) idea. I spent the next day apologizing for my caveman-like behavior and pounding water to fight the extra-strength hangover that followed. Fun! The last 4 days of my fast were spent at a family reunion, replete with barbecued meats and beer (both are like Kryptonite to me, normally). It was frustrating to explain over and over again that: (a) no, I'm not eating right now; (b) no, I'm not eating later, either; (c) no, but I don't want a beer either -- it is not a juice despite its physical state or origin; and (e) yes

So, but I now firmly believe that *anyone* who wants to complete a juice fast needs only a bit of willpower to make a positive change. Even though I wouldn't have considered myself ""obese"" before (large-framed, like a taller Gimli), I have still had a pretty drastic change in appearance and overall health.

Now that my fast is over, Inc.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286537/) during the fast has convinced me to avoid processed foods whenever possible. Admittedly, [this sort of diet](https://www.drfuhrman.com/images/foodpyramid/foodpyramid-large.png) is new to me, but I am committed to keep at it. I have started tracking my caloric and nutritional intake with the goal of steadily whittling myself down to 165 lb (haven't weighed that little since Parris Island back in 2000) through diet and exercise. Who knows, I may even do another (albeit shorter) juice fast in a few months. We'll see.

Thanks for tolerating my perhaps over-long post, I will gladly answer them. Also, I'd like to thank all of the posters here for getting the answers that I wasn't by my lurking! Remember, juice-fasting isn't too hard and can be pretty enjoyable. If you have the willpower, you can change your life for the better.

The beginning of the week started off strong, tomatoes, broccoli, grapefruit (because I mistook them for oranges), and some blackberries I had in the freezer (had to use a blender for that). I also added some protein powder to ensure that I get my protein in because I work out daily, with every other day being most of my weightlifting. 

Gonna be honest here, but it got the job done.

Wednesday and today's (and tomorrow's) recipe was better, and some kale to the recipe. Still on the 2L method, as I drink the second litre now I can tell you for sure that I have been craving solid food all day. It was bad walking home from the gym. I could smell someone's barbecue, and I think I could smell their potato salad as well. But I remain strong! I will continue my first 5 day fast until I'm out of pre-made juice, which I expect will last me through the first portion of tomorrow. 

One thing that's certainly helped was stepping on the scale before each workout session and seeing the dropoff that has occurred in a measly 5 days! I went from 260 on Sunday to 250 today! I understand that as soon as I eat some solid food that number's going to jump back up by a couple of pounds

So after watching the documentary Fat, but to see the DRIVE in him to drop the pounds and to see how quickly the initial weight loss happened, I think I'm finally getting a fire under my arse to get control over my weight.

I was given a Juiceman 2 centrifugal juicer for free. I know there are many types of juicers, etc. but I can't beat free.

I just tried it out today with a couple apples to learn how to operate and clean the machine

Fruits I can do apples and bananas, and the sweet carrots. I'll do iceberg lettuce if it's floating in a river of thousand-island dressing.

So given all that








**UPDATE**

So I bought a bit of everything in the produce section today. Wanted to see just what I could do and what it would taste like.

Cucumbers: Half a cucumber produced an insane amount of juice. The taste wasn't too strong

Celery: One stalk produced quite a bit of juice. I can see why they're used as a base vegetable. The only problem is my centrifugal ejection juicer couldn't handle ejecting the stringy fibers of the celery and it got clogged and unbalanced the motor. Fortunately my Juiceman 2 is easy to clean

Lemons: I got rid of the rind and juiced the rest. VERY STRONG

Spinach: Here I get into the downside of my centrifugal ejection juicer. It did juice the spinach

Kale: Didn't try to juice because of my juicer clogging on the spinach. I will definitely make a salad tomorrow

Red Bell Pepper: 1 whole pepper (minus the green top of course) made over a cup of juice. Surprising given they are hollow. Clogged my strainer basket but not nearly as bad as celery or spinach. I love eating cooked red bells but drinking a raw red bell is an acquired taste.

Of course the beauty of juicing is in the recipes. Something on their own might suck, and if the juice taste can't be recovered then you throw in an apple or two for sweetness.

Right now I think I'll stick to making apple juice and carrot juice as the juicer can handle those quite well

I recently purchased my first juicer after doing a bunch of research and reading reviews online. I was looking for a balance of price and convenience (both in ease of juicing and speed of juicing)

As it was my first foray into juicing, and the unit I have works, but I've noticed some pulp seems rather wet compared to other pulp (for example, carrots seem to come out like slightly damp sawdust, whereas kiwis are sticky and quite wet).

In reading peoples' complaints about wet pulp from centrifugal juicers

I'm considering returning my centrifugal and getting a masticating unit instead

**Plastic Shavings**

One of the primary complaints on Amazon I read regarding masticating juicers was that the auger blade scraped against the screen

Certainly I'd love to buy an all-metal juicer

How much of an issue are the plastic shavings

**Prep**

One thing I've read about masticating juicers is that they require more prep. How much prep is there, or can I just feed them straight in? Roughly how long does it take you to make each 32oz serving of juice?

**Cleanup**

I won't say that cleaning my centrifugal is a breeze

About how long does it take? Any particularly tricky spots?

I go to see a movie. The lobby is filled with the smell of fresh popcorn. I walk by concession without a thought and go straight into the movie (which was horrible BTW). 11 days ago I would have gotten the largest tub of popcorn without hesitation or thought. While I admit it would have been nice

I drink my dinner and move on to other things quickly. Email. Reddit. Netflix. Even now I am feeling a little hungry. But not so much that it is distracting or has the power to steer me. I feel...content. Still.

My food addiction is no bullshit. It has been a friend. A comfort. An entertainer. A distraction. A hobby. An enemy. For the first time in a long time

So the scale this morning was kind. A substantial drop over yesterday. Why was yesterday different that the previous 8 days? Who knows? It honestly doesn't matter. I stepped off the scale relieved to see some good results

Me and my food addiction need to try and figure out how to make good choices from now on. Not because my belt or the mirror says so,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,t3_1fwsvk

I've also been a serial workout starter/stopper. Most I could ever do consistently is 3-4 weeks at a time. The last month and a half (before the holidays) I was going to the gym pretty consistently a few times a week and was feeling like I was making headway. But my waistline begged to differ. I was feeling like I could eat whatever and it wouldn't matter and slowly put weight on.

So here we are in a new year and I figured now would be as good a time as any to get my diet under control. I was told at the end of the year that a healthy lifestyle is 80% diet and 20% working out. I guess I'd like to get that 80% portion under control before I work the 20% into my daily routine. Like a lot of you I saw Fat

It's the end of day 1 and my head is a little achy. I had two mean green juices and a carrot/apple/celery juice. I'm not really feeling hungry and I have been making sure to keep up my water (about a gallon/day). I'm hoping the tomorrow the headache will subside and I'll continue feeling full enough.

She developed an insane headache around 4PM yesterday and when I got all my questions answered it looks like she gave half her morning juice to one of my sons because he loves them [mistake 1]; then for lunch she had a small (2cup) juice from whole foods [mistake 2]. I explained that these cups were precisely measured for her and she needed to drink all of both of them otherwise she won't be getting what her body needs - and she will be fighting hunger and her instinct to eat. The result for her was a crazy headache that she regretted. I went to the fridge and took out the juice I made for her lunch and made her drink it on the spot. Within 10 minutes the headache was gone and she was once again chipper

I hadn't directly correlated this before and naturally this is the first time I've seen this first hand but it looks like the headaches folks may be getting could be because they aren't getting enough (right) juice throughout the day.

Things are going grand. I'm feeling better than ever. During this whole process I've never had cravings, anything of the sort. My nutrient intake appears to be sufficient and I drink water throughout the day (though not in excess) [probably equivalent to 3-4 bottles. I don't move around too much throughout the day unless I willfully go out for walks or Sun. (I'm mostly indoors for the most part)

I currently don't exceed 10.5 cups of juice per day and average around 8 cups (I usually drink a 4 cup lunch and may skip out on mornings/evenings - or have 1-2 cups). I keep my juice-blends to a higher fruit to veggie ratio in the morning

My body is showing visible changes that those around me notice starting with the face and upper body. My shirts actually show by draping over areas that used to be stretched out so often that they've maintained the shape. I am looking forward as part of the reward of my initial 60 day trek to get a new wardrobe. I had bought a belt before going on my fast and because I ordered it online turned out being shorter than I thought when buckled only had about an inch exposed. Now 18 days later has a good 5-6 inches exposed! All my shorts and pants can't stay on without a belt. (previously I wore a belt for utilitarian and aesthetic purposes but now I actually need one to hold up my pants!)

Since some folks have asked about BMs. My BMs have slowed to around every 3 days now

I used to focus a lot on eating food but now on my juice fast it seems that there is now so much more time to do other things than think about eating throughout the day,000 calorie intake to now about 600-800 calorie intake). Also I don't constantly have to think about finding a 'comfortable restroom' as I used to go about 5 times a day! I've taken up reading, walking, and other hobbies and less computer time (which I used to do so much). :)

I usually have 3 juices a day(listed below).  My supper is around 5pm.  I don't usually have a 4th juice as I'm pretty tired by this point and don't want to bother.  I have [this juicer](http://www.hamiltonbeach.ca/hb_detail.php?item=67801&amp;mc=KA&amp;fc=3&amp;catID=26) and I've been told it is the type that doesn't make juice that can be stored.  This is because it is a ""non-masticating"" or centrifugal juicer (see: cheap) and it heats up the juice and will start oxidizing in about two hours.  


As I said, and weigh approx 370 lbs - my scale doesn't work over 350lbs :(.  I have lost 3 inches on my stomach and I'm very happy about that.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So I finished Day 1 of my uncertain period of time juice fast.

This morning was my first taste of Mean Green. Not being a veg fan, I am guessing from the kale or ginger. Not sure.

The good news is I was never hungry throughout the day. I drank four 16 oz servings spaced throughout the day. I was also drinking water like a guy who loves drinking water.

The juicer itself is a fickle bronco that I am sure I will figure out how to bust in good time. My first go round was messy and uncertain. But I am confident I will become more adept at it as I continue.

For dinner, which was perfect. I made a few adjustments as the recipe was a bit bland, so I added half of a lime, a couple of dashes of vegan worcester sauce and a good helping of Chalula hot sauce. I strained it over ice to make sure it wasn't room temperature. It was hearty and filling and tasted perfect for a first day. Fair warning, the recipe made about 40 oz. of juice. I think smaller tomatoes next time.

Health issues - obese, knee pain when standing, feel like death if I'm active.
Past diets - I did adkins about 6 months ago and it worked for me

========================================

My Juice Plan
-------------------

* 07 days of un-eat
* 03 days of smoothies (juice with pulp)
* 10 days of juice (made with juicer)
* 03 days of smoothies (juice with pulp)
* 07 days of re-eat

-------

My ""Un-eat"" plan
---------------------

GIVE UP -

* alcohol
* tobacco
* margarin
* vegetable oil
* fried foods
* salt
* artificial sweetners 
* caffeine
* dairy (replace with almond milk during un-eat)
* gluten
* processed foods
* meat
* sugar

I will begin to increase my intake of raw salads
Also I will eat more soups, tuna and almonds.

Two days before the cleanse I will try and eat only raw salads
   
I'm going to drink lots of filtered tap water. I like water with lemon too. I hear lemon juice is very cleansing and it will also help you start to flush out your system?

Plan is to have 16 oz hot water with lemon in the mornings 3 days before the fast and throughout.

----------

During the Fast
---------------------

Some points:

* DO NOT take multivitamins
* DO take flaxseed or fish oil supplements for the omega 3 and 6 (?)
* walk regularly
* nap when I need to
* drink plenty of fluids

I plan to do the ""mean green"" juice for my 16 days of no food

Start out with 3 days of Mean Green smoothie made in a blender so the pulp is included.
Follow with 10 days of Mean Green made in a juice so there is no pulp. this is to give my colon that all-needed rest.
Finish off with 3 days of Mean green in the blender again

--------

7 days of Re-Eat
--------------------------

Start with small amounts of soups

By day 3 have salads

day 5 add back dairy

by day 7 be on a regular food diet of 70% veggies and 30% other (bread, etc) for the future!

Eat healthier than I did before. Try to avoid sugars, bad fats, and excess carbs.

I was looking for something super nutritious. For something that I don't usually eat so I could give my body a new and exciting set of nutrients to go nuts with. In the grocery store, oranges, etc. but this time also went for the papaya, pumelo, and the grand marshal of the event:

ALOE VERA.

I take all my wondrous plants home, peel off the skin, rinse off the slick and start jamming the slippery, jello-like flesh in to my juicer. I start putting the solid matter back through the juicer, to ""get the full effect,"" as the evil side of conscious said. At the finish, I was left with ballistics gel in one container, muck-like syrup in the other. 

Being filled strength that only foolishness could bring, I immediately find out exactly what kinds of gods endorse aloe vera.

I had assumed that my mouth would be partying with Aphrodite

The god I was instead met with was Mars, and really doesn't like sissy things like ""flavor"" getting in the way. And in the end, though I may have won victory by way of this war-rider, by what cost was victory had?

The term bitter would be appropriate though ineffectual here

Due to its highly viscous nature, inducing a fit of coughing. This fit, of course, prevented me from alleviating the war crimes being committed in my mouth, as I was unable to drink water.

After what seemed like years, and achieved victory. However, the effects still linger. I am still clearing my throat and can still taste the aftermath.

Then the holidays hit, and I managed to just eat clean [and pig out only at holiday dinners], and lost another 40# through the season [a fact I'm super proud of].  Since January, I haven't lost or gained any weight, but I've started lifting and working with a trainer the last month or so, and get the ball rolling on my weight loss again, or to lose significant weight, and tuna or chicken for dinner.

I've also been taking some classes. I figured putting in this much time and concern just about my weight is a little vain (though an absolute health necessity) so I've been watching 3 of ""The Great Courses"" series. They're hundreds of dollars if you buy them but my public libraries have them for free.

269.0 is the lowest weight I've ever recorded on my wii fit which I've owned for 3 years. When I update next week I'll be at an all new wii fit low. 260 is the lowest I've been since 2007. I think that's entirely within striking distance for the next few weeks. I'm also glad that I lost more than 5lbs this week. I don't know why that number is psychologically important to me but I'm always glad to see it.

As always this community has been tremendously helpful when things get difficult mid week.

So I am on the plus side of a week solid without chewing a thing. Frankly

Speaking of

Let me just share something with you. [Look at this](http://i.imgur.com/IRLYuwo.png).

This is a graph from MFP of my weight for the past 7 days. Notice something? Yep, but since then, meh. And let me tell you, the 1000-1400 calories a day is what I was eating in an appetizer for one meal a little over a week ago. So, what gives?

In addition to weight, while I see this flat weight number pop up, I have also noticed my body fat percentage drop. Like 6% so far. I'm not lifting so I am not making up for it in muscle, so what the hell is going on?

Without any research, or nutritional science, this is the conclusion I have come to. Prior to starting this juice journey, I drank soda, Diet Coke to be specific, almost exclusively. I also ate salt and fat and a lot of it in every meal. I think prior to starting juicing, I was chronically dehydrated. I started juicing and drinking water exclusively. The body initially reacts to the drastic cut in calories by dropping weight like a mother fucker. Then it settles down and adjusts to the new thing I am making it do. All the while refreshing my dehydrated body with all this new moisture. Calories cut = lower fat percentage. More much needed water = water retention and not a sharp drop in weight. This is pure conjecture on my part by the way.

But here is the bottom line. I am in it for the long haul. Whatever the scale says this week or next is irrelevant. Here is real talk. I haven't had meat, I will be discouraged, of course. I will also be very confused. But will I feel better, have more energy, etc? Of course I will. And this really is about health not a waist size.

So for those of you who wonder whether this regime is worth it

I've been overweight since I was a kid. My parents just had no concept about healthy eating and as a result I remember in high school my mom would order a pizza just for me. 

Now im 29 and living on my own. I make 46k a year and guess what, hobbies, saving etc. I order pizza and/or grubhub 1-2 times a day. On top of that, im addicted to energy drinks and cigarettes.

1) Given the above information

2) I have a Vitamix and have done raw vegan for 2 weeks. Is there any benefit to juicing over blending from a weight loss perspective? I think blending just has the fiber and juicing just doesnt.

3) What exactly is the fat

Im not living. Im killing myself and this year its hit me hard leading to suicidal depression and if not suicidal

There is a 3-6 pound weight difference between your body on a juice fast and your body while eating that has nothing to do with fat or muscle loss.

Firstly, and will not be replaced.  Your 'normal' weight includes a throughput of food.

Secondly, it needs to add water.  It is possible to die from drinking several gallons of water very quickly because you can disrupt these blood salt levels.

Thirdly

I am not new to juicing but new to fasting. I have been replacing a meal a day with a juice and I would like to replace all my meals to help me lose some weight. 

I do fine with a thin juice in the mornings however
Would it be okay to juice more  than 3 times day? 
Is there a major difference in the juices that come from a juicer and vitamix? 
Also is it okay to have an almond smoothie (I make my own almond milk) during the fast?

Quick info first: Day 11 of 60 (first fast), 6'2"" starting weight just above 440 lbs (not sure how just above because that was the max reading on the digital scale and it was showing ""---.-"" meaning I was over it).

I'm on the fast because I watched ""Fat, given the usual ""results are atypical, yours may vary.""

In the 11 days I've been on the fast I've discarded roughly 25 pounds. I'm not getting too hungry

My juices generally consist of:

* Bunch of kale
* 1 cucumber
* 1 small lemon
* 2 granny smith apples
* 3 stalks of celery
* 1 carrot
* 1 thumb sized chunk of ginger
* sometimes I'll throw in a few grapes or strawberries

Question: I guess my question is wondering if this is normal or should I be worried? I understand since I'm larger I'll likely have faster loss initially

Any other tips/advice would be appreciated.

One thing though: I have only done 2 days where I only had juice. The rest of the days I have eaten at least one thing. It differs as to what these were. Some days it was a oven baked chicken thigh covered in chili flakes. Some days it was a small handful of almonds. Some days it was 3 pieces of bacon and half a homemade almond butter sandwich.

Does anyone think this has voided the benefit of the juice fast? I don't

First off, waiting to go to college hopefully next summer, and weigh 225 lbs. I was at an average of 173 lbs throughout my High School years, because I always took advantage of my school's Cardio Room. Unfortunately, on July 9th 2011, I was T-boned by a drunk driver coming home from my best friend's, and was hospitalized. The doctor told me that I was lucky, my Left leg

Unfortunately, I have no hope of ever being employed for any kind of Physical Labor, so I have to hope that I can do some thing with Coding Games once I start / get out of college. I also cannot bike, run, or do much nowadays, other than go on Walks with my dogs, or Swim during the summer.

Since I cannot apply any where for work now, or Fast food or whatever, but it at least gives me money. Of course, this also means that I sit around the house a lot, with only being able to Walk for at least an hour each day.

Since I can't do much, and helps shed a lot of weight fast.

1. What I am wondering, and cannot get one at the moment, since Financials for us is tight (We're between Low and Mid Class, but closer to Low Class.) Is it possible for me to do Juicing with a Blender? I was told that it's best to have a Juicer, because then you're avoiding getting the Fiber or some thing from the skin of the Vegetables / Fruit (The Pulp or whatever,) but is it really necessary to have those removed?

2. I am not sure what recipes would work. I am going into this completely blind. Might try experimenting with some combinations, but also helps a lot with losing weight?

I appreciate any and all help I could get from you guys about it. I am hoping that I can still Juice without a Juicer VIA a Blender.

So I have been juicing quite successfully for about 11 days (as of 4/23) and I have lost 22 pounds. I am happy with the progress and I have seen nothing but positive results thus far.

I gave up everything cold turkey. No coffee no sugars

I had been eating seasoned steak, and cilantro with black beans for lunch daily for 30 days. Dinner was normally chicken thigh or breast, sometimes soup but rarely, and breakfast was always the worst - a bagel with butter and a large coffee from Dunkin.

I find myself wondering when the juicing is done - why not go with what seems like a traditional keto diet? It certainly seems more satisfying to taste buds. Juicing is very difficult and I yearn for some steak or sausage or chicken quite badly.

When I drink a 16oz juice of any kind I feel VERY full. Every time. The cravings are addiction and nothing more I think. That said - wouldn't it be possible to combine small portions with 16oz of juice? i.e. a chicken breast or one skillet eggs or some steak tips?

I am very much in ketosis - I tested today and it was the darkets color on the strip - admittedly I am probably not drinking enough water - the juice plus maybe 100oz a day so about 3/4th of a gallon. I am horrible about water but I am trying to improve that and I have gotten better.

So is ketojuicing possible?

I have finally made up my mind that I do not want to be fat and I want to live and feel more healthy. I started this fast at 220 lbs and I plan on ending the fast at 170 lbs. After I end the fast I will continue juicing 1 or 2 meals per day and stay mostly vegetarian after that. I guess I hope that I can provide another story for someone else to read and know that juicing/dieting/weightloss ect can be done! So I will try and update this post as things progress for me.

Day 1: nothing to say other than that night sucked!
Day 3/4: the worst so far. I really wanted to quit and I feel extremely weak when I woke up on day 4.
Day 4: I started going to the gym. Its been a couple years since I've gone with any regularity. I am sticking with a simple daily routine. Back/Biceps
Day 5: I woke up feeling awful and it only got worse throughout the day. I I went to the gym in the afternoon and felt ok for awhile  after. But the late evening and bed time were AWFUL. I was really quezy and I couldn't sleep for some time.
Day 6: Woke up feeling great! My sickness passed in the night and I slept fine after that. Plan on gym this afternoon! So far I have lost 8lbs.

I won't update everyday or make a list like this all the time. Just as I can or if anything important happens. I'll also try to answer any questions with what limited knowledge I have.

I made an orange juice from 4 clementines. Probably some of the best I've had in my life. Then I threw a banana in expecting the worst...and got the worst haha. In case you were wondering

Decided to get a little adventurous and threw aloe vera leaves and an apple in. Turned out to be pretty disgusting but I was curious since I've seen big jugs full of the stuff.

Made some mean green for dinner and I'm feeling back to normal. I think if I had a mid day juice I wouldn't have struggled as much his evening so I guess overall I'm feeling a little better than yesterday.

1357506448.0,162u4r,Some thoughts on my experience,coastiepike,6,0,13,"I'm starting my second juice fast.  I originally did my first one back during spring break of 2012 and I made it 16 days before I gave up on it.  I made it through a very very very tempting Easter Sunday family get together and a couple more days until I reached my first midterm and the stress of school broke my will and I returned to eating.  I was feeling amazing though by that point.  Though I still craved food I was feeling great energy wise.  I was starting to run again and I was a whirlwind around the house
My wife isn't that supportive of my choice to juice.  She is worried about the costs of the veggies
I did not do well after my last juice fast.  I was stressed at school and I gained all the weight back pretty quickly and I've continued putting the weight on for the rest of the year.  Weighing myself on the first I was 9lbs lighter than my heavies of all time.  I had gained almost forty pounds since the end of my fast in about 9 months.  
So why am I going back to fasting?  There are several things I like about the juice fasting.  The rapid weight loss isn't the only benefit.  I felt great after the first 6 days.  2-4 were the worst, and then 7 on was great.  After 10 I was feeling great, mentally and physically I felt amazing.   
My biggest problem is that I didn't give myself any rules for after the diet.  I had plans
Another movie has inspired me to make some changes too.  Forks over Knives was a bit eye opening and inspiring and I'm actually contemplating going vegan.  This is the most unlikely thing ever thought of
I don't think I'm going to go full vegan but I want most days to follow the whole foods vegan lifestyle and I have a suspicion that when I realize how the fatty processed meats make me feel that I start staying away from them more and more
I'm breaking some rules with this fast too.  I'm allowing myself a cup of coffee in the morning.  I might drop it after a couple days but at least for the last two days it has helped.  
I think it is important to remember that we aren't perfect.  If you don't stay perfect in your fast that doesn't mean you should quit it.  I took a small nibble here or there the first couple of days when prepping food for the family or cleaning up in the kitchen after meals.  Not much but it has smoothed out the introduction phase.  Except for the coffee the last two days (now day 5) have been really really good.  
Another thing I'm doing that works for me is using store bought orange juice.  I tend to not follow typical recipes.  When I'm shopping for veggies I'm going for what is going to give me the most bang for my buck.  Cucumber, apples, carrots, spinach, pears, ginger, and zuccini are most of the staples.  Much heavier on the green and colored veggies than fruit.  I have found that citrus is a great way to make the juice more palatable.  Yet taking the time to peel and prep citrus can take longer.  So I make a large batch of the mostly pure healthy veggie juice and then I can add orange juice to taste.  I find this saves me time and makes it easier to prep something that I actually want to drink.  Sometimes I go as much as 50/50 but sometimes much less.  I can tailor it to how I'm feeling.  I make enough of the veggies to last a full day and sometimes if I'm making it around lunch one day I can stretch a batch through dinner time the next day.  
One tip I would suggest is having the juicer by the sink.  I fill my sink up about half way and add a small amount of distilled vinegar.  I then load my veggies into the sink and let them soak.  I pull them out and peel the cucumbers or prep as necessary and put them in the juicer.  This is the best way that I've found to get my veggies clean.  
Obviously these ideas are not for everyone
I also am a runner though my poor food habits in the past have out weighed the benefits from my running.  If you like to run I would keep it very light at the least for the first 10-14 days.  For me that is about 2 miles or 20-30 minutes of exercise.  Beyond that I'm overly depleting my energy levels and only driving up my hunger cravings.   
So I hope this helps someone out there or maybe this just becomes a little bit of journaling for myself.  Either way I hope to juice for at least another 2 weeks and then really transition into a healthy eating pattern.  Even Joe in the movie talked about how he had done it in the past and then fallen back and it wasn't until his documented 60 days that he finally was able to keep on track and afterwards he ate healthy and reaped the rewards.  Good luck everyone!

I would love to substitute in a smoothie or gallon of juice a day to get in what I need. The will-power is there, I cannot go to a dietitian, as I do not have health care or a job, so money is an issue right now, but it is something that I will look into once I am back in the game.

-With the fast do you have 1 juice for each meal? Breakfast-Dinner

-Is it really expensive?

-What do you do on day 61

-Is it ok to give yourself a ""cheat day"" fast for Mon-Sat then go crazy on sunday?

- And lastly my current exercise plain since i started weight watchers is walk 20-25 Min up and down a hill right next to my house about 4-5 days a week. I have not really been walking for the past 3 weeks due to it being 29999 degrees outside where I live planning on starting again in about a week or so.
