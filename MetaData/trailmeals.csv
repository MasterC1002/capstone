You boil it in the bag it comes in (When I cook only one, remove the pot from heat and let it sit for 10-12 minutes to conserve fuel). Unfortunately, requiring no water means it's heavier to pack, so if you're into ultra lightweight packing, it's probably not for you!

**Ingredients

1 packet Pesto Mix + oil to make Pesto - It calls for something like 3T

3/4 box Angel Hair (the quickest cooking pasta - feel free to use any other pasta you'd prefer)

2 cups salami chunks (we typically bring salami for lunch

1/2 cup parmesan cheese

other cheese

**Process:**

Boil Pasta. The pesto packet we have calls for ~1/2 cup water (I think)

Turn stove to low.  Add 1.5x-2x the amount of oil called for on the packet, and the salami. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until everything is heated and looks *delicious*. The pesto should thicken a bit around the angel hair.

Serve and top with parmesan cheese and other cheese

**For 2:**

6-8 Yukon Gold potatoes

2-3 chicken breasts

3T butter

Salt &amp; Pepper

Tin Foil - lots


It's really easy

You need a fire. Not a rip-roaring fire, but we did end up throwing in some more kindling after our pile burned down a bit. You should probably start the fire 30-45 minutes before you want to cook on it. You can see the coals we cooked on in the album; there should be very few flames (if any) that are licking the sides of your foil. Flames will burn through the foil, coals will cook it evenly.

**To cook:**

First

Chop up the potatoes into 1"" cubes. I leave the skin on but remove any eyes.

Layer two sheets of tinfoil in a cross (t) shape, this smaller piece should be big enough to cover all of the potatoes. Wrap in the larger piece. Every item that goes in the fire should be at least double-wrapped in tin foil (triple wrapped if you buy the thin store brand).

For the chicken, raw chicken in the tin foil, salt and pepper it, and wrap it up! Again, double-layer this tin foil and wrap it tightly to not let any steam (moisture! flavor!) escape.

If you're not into the meat

So

Ingredients: Cashews

In the baking aisle

So now you have 2 ingredients

A food processor works great

I start by blending 2 parts dates with 1 part cashew

Now that the blending is done

* Lay down some plastic wrap
* Lay down some waxed paper or freezer paper
* Spread the date/cashew puree 
* with a rolling pin
* fold the puree in half
* fold all edges of the waxed paper &amp; plastic wrap in
* roll, fold, until you have the thickness you want

Stated another way, like a burrito.  If you fold all the sides in, it will compact nicely.

when you're done, and enjoy.

1342206611.0,wihli,[Breakfast] Bagels with Bacon (and eggs!),failsafe0,9,3,9,"This recipe came about after a ""Winter Camping"" tutorial at REI. We asked what a great breakfast was and they suggested bagels and bacon. Sure!

**Ingredients (for 4):**

[1-2 package shelf-stable bacon AKA microwave bacon](http://bacontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/microwave-bacon-1.jpg), but you could pop it into a plastic baggie for less waste on the trail.

4 Lender's Bagels - these are easy to cut in winter

8 slices cheddar cheese

4 Tablespoons (1/2 stick or 1/4 cup) Butter

6 eggs

Why are the eggs optional? Some people don't have refrigeration when out on the trail or don't want to carry the eggs or pack out the shells. It's still a filling meal without the eggs

**How to do it:**

There are two methods: the vegetarian-friendly method and the meat-y method. The only things that are reversed are the bacon &amp; egg cooking. Let's go vegetarian this time:

Melt 2T butter in the fry pan, so keep it together toward the end. With an 8-10"" skillet, you can cut it into 4 egg portions at the end (if it's a patty) or just have scrambled eggs on your bagels. They're basically the same, but the egg patty is easiest to eat. Melt the cheese during the last minute of cooking. Put it on plates when it's done and cover it with other plates (or sandwich it in some bowls, just try to keep in the heat).

If one of you (ahem! me!) is vegetarian

Add in your bacon. This bacon should only take 5 minutes or less to cook

Remove bacon and throw in 1/2 tablespoon of butter per bagel. Cut the bagels in half, it's toasting in some bacon grease. Can you really go wrong with that?

Sandwich up those eggs, and baby, you got a delicious breakfast bagel.

A chap over at [/r/bicycletouring](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/) recommended I pop my head in here.

I'm hoping to do some cycle touring but I've recently been diagnosed with a gluten intolerance (That means nothing made from or containing wheat/wheat flour). This has caused a problem with any future camping etc mostly due to oats, noodles and bread being my carb staples.

Could you recommend some gluten free foods I could take touring/camping that would be no problem for me to store/cook which would help provide a suitable number of calories to support a cycle tour?

Thanks guys.",self,t5_2t6xo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/trailmeals/comments/10wf08/question_good_foods_for_touringcamping_when_youre/

1325287248.0,nwu0b,[Dinner] Ant and Dandelion Burrito,TheRedditPope,3,2,2,"- 8 Burrito shells

-12 oz package of shredded cheese

-6 oz of salsa (if you don’t want to carry a jar put in a zip lock-the spicier and higher the citrus (lime) content the less perishable it’ll be)

-1-2 plateful of dandelion or wild mustard leaves (make sure you’ve identified these and/or other edible plants)

-4 handfuls of ants or ant larvae (1/2 handful per burrito more if you can procure it)

&gt;In the field, or other edible plants as your getting close to your campsite keep an eye out for dead stumps or ant mounds. I prefer the rotted stumps cause they’re easy to spot, there’s plenty in most Pacific Northwest forests, and almost always contain a plethora of ants or larvae (even in winter). Kick, rip, or pry the stump till you expose the ants. Use a stick to scoop them up, place the stick in a zip lock and squeeze them into the bag. If you can’t find enough ants you can substitute worms, wash your plant source, salsa

We can rent a stove from REI, but my friend said beans give her gas and we're sharing a tent so she said her and beans don't go well together, unless I want to smell her fart in our tent. 

My main concern: 
1. not getting enough protein 
2. having food perish during those 6 days (or do we have to suck it up and buy expensive grocery food in the National Parks to stock up)
