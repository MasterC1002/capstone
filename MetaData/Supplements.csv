1348781213.0,10l1mn,TrueNutrition Custom Mix Thread 2.0,silverhydra,85,3,23,"This is the updated thread from last year's [TrueProtein Custom Mix Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwotp/trueprotein_custom_mix_thread/). A few things have changed

Ever since the Whey Protein update on Examine ([here](http://examine.com/supplements/Whey+Protein/)) which goes into workout timing a fair bit

However

**Fasted Training** (Haven't eaten before the gym)

This is the only one where 'fast' proteins actually matter

- Hydrolyzed Casein [Milk] 15% (Can use PeptoPro if desired
- Hydrolyzed Whey Protein High Grade [Milk] 25%
- Fructose 20%
- Dextrose 40%

And to be honest

**Power** (Alertness and Cognition

This one assumes you are eating at a caloric surplus (and thus, and should be easier on the stomach. The mix is:

- Whey Protein Isolate Microfiltrated [Milk] 40%
- Maltodextrin/Dextrose 40%
- Fructose 20%

Maltodextrin and Dextrose are interchangeable for this one

- A basic stimulant (caffeine works *only if* naive) or N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine (NALT); ephedrine is fine too
- A cholinergic (choline bitartrate is the simplest
- If you want to Hydracetam that shit

**Endurance/Hypertrophy** (Nutrient focused

Same as the above

- Whey Protein Concentrate High Grade [Milk] 20%
- Calcium Caseinate [Milk] 20%
- Dextrose 10%
- Swedish Oat Starch 35%
- Psyllium Husk Seed fiber (under carbs) 5%
- Glutamine Peptides (under the fiber header) 10%

The glutamine is added for when people actually *do* prolong exercise to 2 hours or so; otherwise

- Citrulline
- Beta-Alanine
- Sodium Bicarbonate

**Other Notes**

- All mixes are *not* designed to fuel you after the workout

- I omitted a health mixture because, get a veggie/greens mixture and throw it in some whey concentrate with psyllium husk powder. Done.

- Due to TrueNutrition no longer using compounds that are not protein, the amount you need is reduced as well. TrueNutrition usually sends scoops along with orders, but 1-2 is *plenty* for this; most of your nutrition should be coming along in meals anywho, this is just to get you through the workout",,False,,1348781655.0,t3_10l1mn
1307739997.0,hwotp,TrueProtein Custom Mix Thread,silverhydra,92,18,85,"I was recently asked (In the TrueProtein thread) if I would propose custom supplements depending on goals. I decided to make a quick post about it.

Aside from the Meal Replacement

Basically

**Bodybuilding:**

-	Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Supergrade (20%)
-	Soy Protein Isolate non-GMO (20%)
-	Fructose (10%)
-	Dextrose (20%)
-	L-Leucine by the Pound (10%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine by the Pound (5%)
-	Creapure by the Pound (5%)
-	Citrulline Malate by the Pound (10%)

$10.26 per pound

As many scoops as desired before and during the workout

A note on Soy protein Isolate. The isolate form is so processed and detract from foods that it really isn’t soy anymore

**Powerlifting:**

-	Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Supergrade (30%)
-	Amylocel (Wazy Maize Starch) (20%)
-	Fructose (10%)
-	Dextrose (15%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine by the Pound (5%)
-	Creapure by the Pound (10%)
-	Citrulline Malate by the Pound (10%)

$10.90 per pound

1-2 scoops should suffice. I mainly just chose this mix with neural efficacy in mind and not vomiting during a 1RM attempt (as

**Muscular Endurance (Crossfit

-	Calcium Caseinate (20%)
-	Hydrolyzed Casein (10%)
-	Amylocel (Waxy Maize Starch) (20%)
-	Fructose (10%)
-	Maltodextrin (10%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine (5%)
-	Creapure (5%)
-	Citrulline Malate (20%)

$14.69 per pound

Same idea as powerlifting in order to make it more stomach-happy

It might be good to buy Beta-Alanine on its own

**Meal Replacement:**

-	Rice Protein concentrate non-GMO (20%)
-	Gemma Protein Pea isolate non-GMO (20%)
-	Whey protein concentrate (20%)
-	Taurine by the pound (5%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine by the pound (5%)
-	L-Glutamine by the pound (10%)
-	Psyllium seed husk fiber (10%)
-	Medium Chain Triglyceride powder (10%)

$8.35 per pound

Formulated with health and economy  in mind. This shake is most likely going to be nice and thick after you prepare it

**Flavoring Agents

Packaging is either a large-ass thick plastic bag or a jug. Both are minimally labelled but the jug is priced more but

If you have money to burn, and possibly Protein Enzyme Complex / Electrolytes if you want to aid stomach digestion even further (as the workout protocols are designed to be pre/intra workout stuff anyways).

Choose your artificial sweetener and flavouring of choice. The only thing to note here is that although all flavours (that I have tasted) are good, or cheesecake) will taste ‘off’ if not paired with dietary fats. Having these during a workout with no dietary fats will be sort of a weird taste experience, and thus I would recommend something more berry-like for workouts.

**Edit**

Since this thread is still alive to some. A while ago there was notification that some credit card numbers were leaked from TrueProtein. They seem to, this also happened in the past and they also claimed to have eliminated the threat this time.

I do not know the details of what happened, but this is still something you don't want to risk.

**Double Edit** (07/09/11)

For the past two months there have been no reported credit card number losses from ordering from TrueProtein to my knowledge.

Flavour Log

- Key Lime Pie is godly for workouts; not too sour and does taste like limes (works with both sugared drinks and non-sugared drinks) Citrus Lime-ade is a bit tangier but still great.

- Dutch chocolate fudge is very chocolately, mint) are all good, but the chocolate mint makes a great morning wake-up shooter (face really feels it)

- Strawberry Banana and Strawberry Cheesecake both taste mostly like strawberries

- Chocolate chip cookie dough,,False,,t5_2qhb8,True,,True

Aditionally

- Glycyrrhetic Acid is completely different than any other compound in licorice

Edit: For those of you who previously read ""reductions in testosterone and increases in testosterone""; sorry

- The 'test reduction', and they basically follow the trend of ""Shit bro, GA halves your test (next guy: no, it doesn't reduce test at all) *fine*, it quarters your test"". Despite similar methodology, three very different effect sizes

- High doses *very* reliably increase cortisol, low doses may theoretically reduce cortisol

- Yeah, probably due to plasma binding to albumin (ie, it gets into your blood but doesn't actually leave your blood into fat tissue)

- Licorice flavanoid oil (components of licorice when Glycyrrhetic Acid was taken out) appears to be a relatively potent aromatase inhibitor

- Glycyrrhetic acid appears to augment signaling via Beta2adrenergic receptors. It has historical usage as an anti-asthmatic augmentor (not monotherapy) and given the importance of B2A receptors for this this ability of GA might be biologically plausible. That being said, it reduces the rate of receptor internalization upon ligand binding; a huge limitation of adrenergic receptors).

- Technically glabridin is a nootropic (enhancing learning in animals that do not have cognitive impairment) but I would not put too much faith in this. It was a high dose used

- Liquirtigenin and Isoliquirtigenin are amazing SERMS; they act on the beta subunit while antagonising the alpha subunit (a good modulation for weightlifters) in the nanomolar concentrations

- It appears to have potent CYP3A4 inhibitory potential

In regards to *all* effects of Licorice

All I can really stand behind right now is the usage of Deglycyrrhizinated (without Glycyrrhizin and Glycyrrhetic Acid) Licorice Flavanoid Oil for the purposes of beneficially influencing estrogen,,False,,t5_2qhb8,1355259749.0,,True

--------------------

So I recently got asked by sudowork over on Fitocracy what I thought about AnimalPak as a multi. I think it's overpriced and could have some better ingredients. So I'm gonna try and come up with something as close to it as possible that's cheaper and/or better.

Over at [BB.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/univ/animalpak.html) it's $27 for a 22 day supply

Okay so here it is:

---------------------

[Truenutrition](http://www.truenutrition.com/): (you can use silverhydra's coupon code for 5% off if you like

[$48 for Fish oil for the year](http://truenutrition.com/p-1111-fish-oil-complex-1000mg-softgels-1000-softgels.aspx) (assuming 5-6 pills/day

[$23 or $46 for Beta-Alanine for the year](https://www.smartpowders.com/p-6071-beta-alanine-500-g-176-oz.aspx)

[$14 for Taurine for the year](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5355-taurine-powder-1000-grams.aspx)

Edit: Buying Smartpowder's Totalis and Creatine separately and then taking half the recommended dosage of Totalis with 5g/day of Creatine might actually be cheaper long term. Alternatively you could add any missing ingredients to the Totalis (Creatine, Theanine, Taurine) for a super mix.

-----------------------

Totals: $283-&gt; $328/year

**Personally what I would consider doing: Go with 1000g Beta-Alanine, +all the other ingredients (obviously).**

Grand Total Then: **$316/year** before discounts

All you would need on top of this is protein powder methinks (available at smartpowders/trueprotein for cheap as hell), ALCAR, and Choline. I guess you could also get more of a lot of the aminos (for those of you who dose 5-10g Creatine, 5-10g Beta-Alanine, 3-5g Citrulline, etc). But I picked out all the ingredients I could within the same price range of AnimalPak, so yeah. Although the functionality of this stack sure as hell beats AnimalPak

For those of you in the UK/Europe I would say try and compare prices between [MyProtein](http://www.myprotein.com/uk/) and SP/True Protein/iHerb and see what comes out cheaper after shipping.

-------------------------

If you're looking to go cheapo with the stack:

1000 caps Fish Oil, Magnesium, 500g Choline, 200g Inositol, 1000g Creatine, 500g ALCAR, 500g Taurine

-----------------------------

How to mix everything: 

Pre-workout Pump: Creatine, ALCAR, Tyrosine, (optionally) half the Inositol

KEEP THE CITRULLINE SEPARATE! IT WILL CLUMP UP THE PRE-WORKOUT OTHERWISE! BUT TAKE IT AT THE SAME TIME.

Post-workout (or even pre-bedtime): Inositol

Taken together in the morning (fat soluble): Fish Oil, Vitamin K1

Whenever you want: Zinc

Before bed: Melatonin (you can take Magnesium and Zinc at this time too)

Best with meals: Multivitamin

Don't take before sleep: Choline, Vitamin D, Creatine


----------

In terms of *actual* mixing, and then stir them up real good before taking anything. I have a 5mL scoop that I use to measure out stuff and I weight how much 1 scoop is of the stuff and then scale up from there (usually works out to about two scoops of the pre-workout and 1 scoop of the bed time mix)",,False,,t5_2qhb8,1371874579.0,,

Matt Cahill is the guy behind DS Craze. He was in prison for selling DNP (a weight loss drug / metabolic poison) that eventually killed one of his customers. In that same case it appears he was dealing multiple substances (steroids

Many people speculate that the original formula was spiked with a synthetic stimulant not listed in the formula. Some claim the formula has never changed.

In a thread on ThermoLife someone believes n-benzyl-2-phenethylamine  &amp; N-ethyl-Beta-Methylphenylethylamine may be in the formula.

The naming convention &amp; packaging of craze makes it impossible for anyone to understand whats in it. Try googling the PEA-like compounds and see what you can find. Probably very little! There is also little information on Dendrobium making it a good way to say it is ""all natural"".

By modifying PEA people can produce powerful drugs that require low doses. Many of these drugs are new and unsafe.

This time I'm looking to do a replacement for both [Jack3d](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/usp/jacked.html) and [White Flood](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/clabs/flood.html) but for a bit cheaper and hopefully more effective. A 45 day supply of Jack3d (at 1scoop/day) is $28

Given ~$250 to work with for a year's supply I'm going to try to go through a list of stuff that I think would be beneficial for a good pump, especially for prolonged periods).

Now this might count as cheating a bit but one thing I'd like to include a bit of Scivation Xtend to the preworkout. It contains BCAAs, Electrolytes, Vitamin B6 and also some flavouring to boot. It's not necessary especially if you're not training fasted, but it's not a bad set of ingredients and it tastes delicious =D

------------------

[2500g of Scivation Xtend](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-7628-original-xtend-sale.aspx) for $78 (optional but awesome

[500g of ALCAR](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5238-acetyl-l-carnitine-powder-500-grams.aspx) for $18

[500g of Beta-Alanine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-6071-beta-alanine-500-g-176-oz.aspx) for $22 (you can double this up)

(I wouldn't personally include this) [400 caps of 20mg DMAA](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5366-13-dimethylamylamine-200-caps-20mg.aspx) for $28

[400g of Caffeine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5261-caffeine-anhydrous-400-grams.aspx) for $13 (only using between 73-146g of Caffeine for 200-400mg per serving)

[500g of Choline Citrate](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5268-choline-citrate-500-grams.aspx) for $12

[750g of Citrulline](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5273-citrulline-malate-powder-75-grams.aspx) for $45

[1000g of Creatine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5280-creatine-monohydrate-powder-1000-grams.aspx) for $12 (you can add more of this too)

[20g of Theanine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5327-l-theanine-powder-20-grams.aspx) for $7

[500g of Tyrosine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5331-l-tyrosine-powder-500-grams.aspx) for $14 (you could also go for only [200g](https://www.smartpowders.com/p-5330-l-tyrosine-powder-200-grams.aspx) for $8)

[400g of Inositol](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5315-inositol-200-grams.aspx) or something) for $20 (you could also go for only 200g)

Total Cost: $241. Cheaper than Jack3d by quite a bit.

------------------

If you mix all of these supplements together in a big batch (excluding DMAA and only including 73-146g Caffeine) you end up with 6743-6816g of product

All of this provides approximately:

5mg Vitamin B6, 0.8g Isoleucine, 0.8g Valine, 2.5g Citrulline, 1.4g ALCAR, 20mg DMAA (I wouldn't use it), 0.2-0.4g Caffeine, 2.7g Creatine(can double), 1.1g Inositol(can half).

---------------------------

I'd imagine this product is even better than 2 scoops of Jack3d or 2 servings of Whiteflood (with some benefits and some negatives, but they might also be pretty helpful for ""the pump"" (GABA/Gluocronolactone). Some ingredients compete for absorption a bit (Tyrosine and the BCAAs), but there is a fairly substantial amount of them to allow for a decent amount of absorption of them.

GPLC, go for it.  You can make the switch to choline citrate (1-1.5g Choline Citrate instead of 0.5g Alpha-GPC), 1:1 for Tyrosine/NALT, and ALCAR (1.25g ALCAR instead of 1.25g GPLC).

1369074936.0,1epjif,Agmatine: Examine update and discussion (shit might be whack),silverhydra,36,8,37,"So I was having fun these last two weeks with a few updates

**Mechanisms?**

It's a neurotransmitter

The role of agmatine in the agmatinergic system is to modulate NMDA glutaminergic receptors (technically enhances it at low doses

It seems to only quell NOS when it is overactive

It also enhances serotonergic signalling and ultimately inhibits potassium channels indirectly via that

The two *main* mechanisms of action are activating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (antagonistic of yohimbine) and activating imidazoline receptors (as far as nutraceuticals go

**Uses?**

The most promising usage IMO would be for neuropathic pain

And yes

Beyond those two

Due to the interactions with nicotine

Beyond the analgesic and antiaddictive properties, so it isn't anything like theanine).

There are mixed effects on memory formation with agmatine. It appears to stimulate activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (suggesting memory enhancement) but although it has been linked to increasing memory it does *not* appear to enhance spatial memory (water maze task) and it actually appears to be negative against emotional fear based conditioning (this might be a good thing to some people). I saw a few authors mentioning it is likely positive for cognition when looking at 'higher cognition' but either inert or inhibitory against emotional stuff

**Downsides?**

Firstly, and it uses the same transporters as arginine/ornithine and since those things get saturated at 10g a 0.5-2g dose of agmatine is likely well absorbed.

Also

Finally, but due to the lack of human evidence I cannot be sure.

1358566048.0,16uvt1,"Responded to a thread about Animal Pak, decided the response is worthy of its own thread: Why I have an issue with Animal Pak and other popular daily packs. ",t3hlulzkiller,48,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/16uvt1/responded_to_a_thread_about_animal_pak_decided/

My opinion is just *slightly* biased because I own a company that competes directly with animalpak's product. HOWEVER, though, is that the ingredient does not have to be readily bioavailable or active. You'll see that alot in some of the most popular daily vitamins (looking at you OT) and packs on the market today. Keep this in mind, but it's very difficult to spot any of these loopholes without a lot of knowledge in 1) chemistry and 2) FDA labeling guidelines/regulations.  

My biggest issues with animal pak are the following:

* Vitamin D is obnoxiously low. we're all aware of the benefits of higher vitamin D consumption and a true daily pack should mean you don't have to go out and buy another Vit D supplement to supplement your supplement
* The entire B-complex is dosed extremely high. This may have not been a big deal if you weren't suppose to take this supplement daily - however
* 400mg of magnesium oxide taken at once is a laxative ;)
* the mineral portion of this product are poorly bioavailable as sulfates. At this day and age
* Zinc in oxide form is poorly bioavailable compared to other various forms (sulfate, picolinate) 
* Selenium should be L-Selenomethionine for proper bioavailability. 
* Amino Acid Complex is just 6 grams of Whey Protein Concentrate (listed as the subsequent amino acid breakdown of whey). This kind of thing really turns me off. What it is: cheap WPC
* Performance Complex has quite a few fluffer ingredients, Oriental Ginseng ROOT (**Not the extract!!**)
* Anti-Oxident Complex is 60% fluff ingredients. Sadly
* Digestive Enzyme Complex: Bromelain is not reported correctly. The efficacy of bromelain is measured by GDU (Gelatin Dissolving Units). There is no mention of the concentration of GDU in this bromelain. The cost differentiation between a low gdu bromelain and a high gdu bromelain can be 8x as much for the same amount of overall bromelain. Any good businessman knows if they're not saying how many gdu, seems redundant to me. Lipase is actively measured in LU (lipase activity units). There is no specification of how many LU this 10mg provides; According to UMM an adult should take a daily sum total of 18,000 LU of lipase per day to see beneficial effects. 

These are just some of the more glaringly obvious things I have a problem with in this formulation. I'm really tired of the hidden dishonesty of supplement companies trying to fluff their labels and mislead their customer base. A good daily supplement should consist of three things: 1) bioavailable

Above all else, more honest industry as a whole - that's worth it.

**#As background:**

Male, I was diagnosed with both an inguinal hernia and a [varicocele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele). I had the hernia repaired but not the varicocele (not covered by insurance), but at the time I had blood testosterone tests as well as sperm tests (as varicocele is implicated in lowering male testosterone and having poorer quality sperm). My diet at the time was a cut, and my preferred method is to mix Protein Sparing Modified Fast style eating (2-3 days at a time) with ad libitum eating for one meal every few days (usually high carb and post squats/DL's). I was also drinking quite heavily (read &gt;30 pints of strong lager per week). I'd had at least 6 pints the night before the first blood test.


Fast forward about a year, followed the same diet as above and slept 8+ hours per night. During the 5 weeks I lost around 6-7lbs of bodyweight and 6% body fat (using Navy calculation method). Strength on my lifts went up (didn't try 1RMs, but hit significant improvements on volume, and all numbers went up). I'm in approximately the same shape I was when the tests were taken last year (~15% body fat).

**#The Results: Bloodwork**

- The study noted that stopping AMPK stopped atrogin-1 and also the nutrient uptake (no overall effect) and abolishing atrogin-1 let the nutrients induce muscle protein synthesis

- The atrogin-1 induction was also abolished by mitochondrial support; particularly induction of PGC1a

Attached is just what I found right now; I sort of knew this was the case but I could not prove it until I found the study. Contractions of muscle tissue induces PGC1a and is likely to lessen any adverse skeletal effects of berberine.

For a quick introduction to this

Here, and thus we are deficient in glycine. For reference, amino-acid analysis of gelatin is: glycine 21 %, proline 12 %, hydroxyproline 12 %, glutamic acid 10 %, alanine 9 %, aspartic acid 6 %, valine 2 %,hydroxylysine 1 %

Peat argues that when we eat muscle tissue, which is linked with effects of ageing (i.e. immunodepression, inflammation), and that to balance this we should have an intake of glycine-rich foods, such as gelatin.

Why glycine? Research shows that L-glycine is immunomodulatory

The first effect I noticed was on sleep, my mind would be racing and frantic, you know how you have imaginary conversations in your head before you sleep, well imagine that except 20 people are all talking at once. I've experienced restless leg syndrome before and ashwagandha seemed to induce it, please read up on it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome) because there's a lot of misconception over restless leg syndrome and it's probably not what you think it is. It actually was not as bad with a larger dose and the effect seemed to wear off after a few days. I remember taking a day or two off ashwagandha, then taking a dose and when going to bed thinking ""yep, it's back"". 

I believe it has had a positive effect on stress during the day but not mood or anxiety. I think back to when I was trying maca and there's a big difference in stress and aggression despite a work load increase. I admit it's hard to say if I'm confirming for me maca's negative effect

I like to read around as many online forums as possible to get a sense of what the general opinion is, like I said I feel a whole lot less stressed than a few weeks ago on maca, that I'm certain on, but was it ashwagandha's effect? Maybe. It had no effect on mood or anxiety, so as an overall feel-good supplement probably not worth it.

I was taking ashwagandha mainly to see its possible use as a sex supplement, however there was an interesting an unexpected effect on sex. I'll be blunt, I had normal sex with my girlfriend, ejaculated everywhere and did our usual clean up, but immediately after I felt like I didn't even have an orgasm, my arousal level was like I was just getting ready for sex ...and I guess I was because we continued to have sex for another 45min or more. In the morning I was wondering why I was still so keen after an orgasm, usually I just want to sleep or go do something else but I'm certainly not interested in additional sex. I thought maybe ashwagandha has an effect on that post-orgasm oh-god-what-have-I-done feeling (cue [the meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-god-what-have-i-done--2/photos) NSFW). It's a real thing - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_(sex), consider [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11979330) and [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1949087.stm). I found [one study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ashwagandha%20prolactin) where ashwagandha showed reduced production of prolactin, just helps to get back in the mood. I started getting blue balls all the time when I increased the dose, that's way too much speculation though and I'll judge it against upcoming weeks off the supplement.

TLDR (in my wild speculation)

Good:

- Inhibits or reduces post-orgasm refractory period

- Stress relief

Neutral:

- No negative effects on gastrointestinal tract

- No effect on mood or anxiety

- No effect on libido

Bad:

- Sleeplessness

- Restless Leg Syndrome

- Orgasm harder to achieve

We've all heard the story. Such and such guy from such and such store is selling such and such product and he said it would boost my T levels.

Can anyone tell me about such and such product? Yes

^These types of threads are not productive. Any T-booster that does a little something (which is hardly significant) has been posted about a lot (such as DAA).

The fact is true performance enhancers are well known. We know they come in 2 varieties steroids &amp; prohormones (note PH are not well known in the sense of having a long human history

Steroids are a controlled substance with a long history of human use. Under proper conditions they can be safe (this is why doctors prescribe them). They have strong effects on the body which is why they have strong side effects on the body.

Prohormones are in a legal gray area. They have a poor history of human use. No doctor will prescribe these (human safety is questionable). They have strong effects on the body which is why they have strong side effects on the body.

Anything that isn't a PH/Steroid hasn't been shown to have significant levels on free T.

If you did find something that was OTC &amp; worked it would have side effects similar to a PH/Steroid. I have never seen a product that can have similar effects of a PH/steroid without side effects. The side effects are from your body's natural response. 

Any supplement that boosts T is correcting a deficiency in your diet and is not an actual T booster. These help people who have low test due to a specific deficiency. If I pop extra Zinc every day i'm not going to build significantly more muscle or muscle at all for that matter (i already get enough Zinc from my diet).

Further more even if you find ""the magic supplement"" it will have the same effects of steroids/PH. This will call for PCT which will involve drugs that are most likely controlled. OTC PCT is not adequate for products that significantly boost T.

I have to reconcile that with working full-time and then some.

Why did I do it?  
At the end of February, I didn't have enough time for excercise and I ate too little, so my lifts dropped **a lot**. In one month:  
BP: 57.5kg -&gt; 50kg  
OHP: 37.5kg -&gt; 32.5kg  
Squat: 90kg -&gt; 72.5kg  
DL: 120kg -&gt; 100kg  
(all 3x5).  

I noticed this and started eating like before, but my recovery was going painfully slow. I started researching albuterol and it seemed like a wonder drug - no sides, great efficiency. It's so safe, doctors prescribe it to kids in syrup form (4-8mg daily). I ordered some and started eating it.  

Day1: 12mg (mistake
Sides: Shaky hands
Day2: 12mg  
Sides: Shaky hands
Day3-5: 12mg  
Sides: none  
Day6-10: 16mg  
Sides: none  
Day11: 20mg  
Sides: none  
Day12: 16mg  
Sides: none  
Day13: 12mg  (today)
Sides: none  
Day14: 8mg (tomorrow)  
Sides: we'll see. I don't expect anything  

I plan to pop 4mg on day 15 and 16, but just to be sure. Plan to use it few days after I stop taking albuterol.

Now this has been interesting: My weight went from 74kg@19%bf to 68kg@14%bf in **7 days**. bf% measured on electronic personal scale, but my lovehandles almost disappeared. I have fucked up fat distribution for some reason, everything goes to my lower stomach. I see my top abs even at 20% bf.

But the most interesting thing is - I regained my strength and **more**.  My stats as today:

BP: 65kg  
OHP: 35kg (still sucks
Squat: 92.5kg  
DL: 125kg  
(3x5)

Not bad for 2 weeks

My training was modified Greyskull LP. No cardio

A: BP 3x5, chins 3x4 (+negatives), squat 3x5, calf raise 3x20  
B: OHP 3x5, machine chins 3x8, yates rows 3x5, DL (100kg) 1x5 no belt, DL 1x5 belt, shrugs 3x12
AxBxAxB...  
All 3x5 excercises are greyskull style = last set is ""as many reps as possible""

I don't want to persuade anyone to take prescription only substances

1345848820.0,ys2iy,Maca trial (libido enhancer),Libidodo,15,1,12,"I'm giving a bunch of claimed libido enhancers and semen volumizers a test

**THE GOOD**:

I noticed a definite boost in libido, trivial things would set me off, I was entertaining sexual ideas that I'd lost interest in long ago, I viewed more porn because I wanted some kind of stimulation more often.

My girlfriend tells me my semen has a consistent bitter taste, just something she noticed on her own.

I also wake up in the middle of every night to go to the toilet, maybe it has some voodoo effect on the urinary tract.

**THE NEUTRAL:**

There was no effect on erection quality

**THE BAD:**

This is hard to explain and I don't know how much weight you'll hold in my anecdote but I'm just going to report what I experienced. Maca is touted as an anxiolytic and stress reliever but I experienced the opposite at times. I noticed increased stress, the best way I can describe it is I felt emotionally fragile, that might sound fruity but it's what I felt. In stressful environments I had emotional surges where I felt like I was holding back a 5yr old's tantrum, other times when there was no real stressors around I just felt sad for no reason (*not depressed*) and lonely at times (fwiw I'm not a loner, I have friends, hobbies, a girlfriend, I was also sweating a more just throughout the day so there's a physical response to support my anecdote

It could just be that I had a particular stressful time at work or something else

If you were going to try it, panax ginseng, alcohol?), then put it away rather than take it continuously.

Then there's seminal volume, maca actually has some studies to back it up, so I was hopeful for some results. It didn't increase volume ([chart here](http://i.imgur.com/kX8Dj.png)), in fact it trended downward. You can't draw concrete conclusions from a two week study on one guy, but if anyone tries to tell me maca will make you ""cum buckets"" my response now is they're full of shit.

In the end it's cheap and I definitely recommend you at least try it if you're in the market for a sex supplement

I could really use some advice from someone more experienced than me.

I workout 3-4 times a week and prior to two weeks ago, green tea extract and CLA.

I bought a tub of MP Assault as I thought it was considered one of the more gentle PWOs on the market. I've only been doing half a scoop to keep it light.

Fast forward to Wednesday. I get off work, walk into the locker room, drop my gym bag and I realize that my right arm, up to the elbow and especially the fingers is very numb. I get a little panicky and in my idiot state, google ""symptoms of a heart attack"". Of course tightness in chest and numbness in extremities is there so I decide to drive myself to the emergency room.

At this point I may be having a panic attack. My arm feels numb above the elbow and I think my right leg (same side) is starting to feel numb as well. I get to the emergency room and get checked in.

Here are the results:

*148/96 BP

*350 CKP

*All else normal.

*Normal blood floow on EKG.

*Normal pulse.

*No reduction of motor control

I get released and go home. The doctor doesn't think I had a heart attack but apparently can't be 100% sure. She thinks I had too much stuff in my system without enough water to balance it.

I personally tend to agree because I had drank somewhat heavily the night before so my body was dehydrated. I did the math on some of the things I took.

*3 caplets of Excedrin for morning hang over - 195mg

*1 16oz cupf of dark coffee - 160-180mg.

*1/2 scoop of MP Assault - 150mg.


That brings me to about 525mg for about a 9 hour period. It's high and it could explain the chest tightnes

I train for Powerlifting 3-4 days a week

On average I get 5-6 hours of sleep per night. Some of those nights might get broken up for me to look into an issue.

In the last 3 weeks

Currently, my diet is:

Diet: (Total Calories is usually around 2200

**Breakfast**: None.

**Lunch:** Meat (chicken, fish, something) + Veg (Broccoli and green beans are common, but other greens as well)

**Dinner**: Basically the same as lunch. Lunch is usually just left over dinner.

**Random Snacks** - law carb tortillas /w peanutbutter or cheese or something. Pepperoni because it is fucking delicious

**Supplements:**

* No-Xplode or something similar pre-workout
* Whey (whatever amount is needed to hit my 200g/protein a day goal - some days this means none)
* Fishoil 6g/day
* Choline - 1g/day (I think
* ZMA - [This](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/now/zma.html)
* Inositol - Just started taking this as it was recommended due to the lack of fruit in my diet. 
* Caffeine - Varies
* Creatine - 5g/day
* Vitamin D - 4000iu (forgot this originally please don't kill me herman.)



I find that with lack of sleep, it is unplanned, so I get stuck with fast food, which can be ok, but I usually end up feeling like shit for it. I've started keep emergency food in the freezer at work (some fish and broccoli) to prevent this.


So

""I take about 250 pills of nutritionals a day"".

""For boosting antioxidant levels and for general health, coenzyme Q10, grapeseed extract, resveratrol, bilberry extract, lycopene, silymarine (milk thistle), lecithin, garlic

For reducing insulin resistance and overcoming my type 2 diabetes

To improve LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, plant sterols, niacin, oat bran, grapefruit powder, psyllium, lecithine and lipitor. To improve blood vessel health I take arginine, B6 and TMG. 

I have a B12 shot once a week and take a daily B12 sublingual. Several of my intravenous therapies improve my body's detoxification: weekly EDTA and monthly DMPS. I also take n-acetyl-carnitine orally. I take weekly intravenous vitamins and alpha lipoic acid to boost antioxidants. I do a weekly glutathione IV to boost liver health. 

Perhaps the most important intravenous therapy I do is a weekly phosphatidylcholine IV, nettle, ginger and herbs to reduce the conversation of testosterone into estrogen. I take a saw palmetto complex for prostate health. For stress management I take l-theonine, beta-sitosterol, phosphatidylserine and green tea in addition to drinking 8 to 10 cups of green tea itself. 

At bedtime I take GABA and sublingual melatonin. For brain health I take acetyl-l-carnitine, ginkgo biloba, glycerylphosphatidylcholine, nextrutine and quercertin. For eye health I take lutein and bilberry extract. For skin health I use an antioxidant skin cream on my face, neck and hands every day. For digestive health I take betaine HCl, pepsin, gentian root, acidophilus bifodobacter, carnosine,

I'm usually pretty careful with pre-workout supplements. I limit it to about 3-4 times a week and I always take the recommended dosages. I've been taking them for months and never had issues and I'm always cautious to drink plenty of water. I've also taken creatine off and on and never had issues.

**Thoughts:**

 Yeah, then started to taper off at the end as the graph kinda shows. This means ostarine may be more suited to 4-week cycling. I also don't feel I gained a significant amount of fat, but I'll wait for the DEXA to know for sure.

 Strength gains were beyond anything else I've ever experienced (noob gains notwithstanding). Again that's likely in part due to the programming

**TL:DR**

A normal weight friend wants to use Stackers for weigtloss as a quick fix without working out/controlling diet. Will this work? Is this dangerous and/or a waste of time/money?

**I would like some help on this matter.**

One of my closest friends has asked me for advice about “Stackers”. He wants to use them for weightloss. I would say that he is normal weight

He will NOT use them as part of a workout plan while taking control of his diet :) (he won’t listen to reason

I know very little about supplements in general and Stackers and similar in particular. I only think I know the basic concept that they contain a number of “uppers” as ephedrine and caffeine and such and stimulates the central nerve system for increased metabolism and energy levels?

These are my questions/concerns:

* Will this have any relevant effect on his goals or is it a waste without exercise/diet?
* How dangerous is it? Common side effects? One-in-a-million bad luck stuff?
* Will it affect mood? Risks for depression or similar (my friend has a history…)?
* Regardless of the above
* Trusted supplier (live in Sweden)?
* Legal status (live in Sweden
* What is the correct use of such products? Get those last percent of deff when you already are pushing workout/diet to max (aka bodybuilding like competition prep?)
* Aren't they more of a pre-workout thing?

I think that is all.

Edit -- I did a little research here and with 6 shakes a day it would still only be about 1000 calories.   I think combined with eating a healthy lunch could put me into the 1600 - 1700 per day range.  Combing with 1.2g of protein per pound this might be doable.

I'm curious about Berberine and figure it can't hurt
  

I am female, but otherwise in good health.  My current goals are fat loss while retaining as much muscle as I can and getting consistent good sleep.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping, have tried a whole bunch of things (even RXs, which I'd like to avoid. )  Nothing works very well, so I want to try mixing some things in higher doses.

So what I currently take could be all of the following

First thing:  Fexofenadine 180mg (Shitty allergies)

Pre-workout:  EC(24/200mg) with Beta-Alanine(1g), Cissus(1g), L-Carnitine(500mg).  (Sometimes I'm lazy and just use Whiteflood.)  I avoid stimulants after 2PM due to the sleep issues, but they happen even if I am cycling off the EC and avoid the other stuff.

At some point with a meal: Fish oil, maybe a multi

Night:  I had been taking Schiff Melatonin Ultra which contains the following: 3mg Melatonin + 25mg L-Theanine + 25mg GABA + Chamomile &amp; Valerian Extracts, and usually about 50mg of diphenhydramine.  Shitty allergies, again.  I can take that dose any time with no drowsy effects, though.

So my question is, but don't want to do something stupid by stacking them.  Are there compounding effects with these things which is why they were in such small quantities in the Schiff product?  (I know about the less is more idea with melatonin.  It doesn't seem to be the case with me and I may just be a non-responder.)

Is there anything in this list of things that is a bad idea to mix and is throwing the Berberine in there going to mess with anything?  

I'm still new

And sorry if this is rambling.  I've had about 4 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours.

From Wikipedia

It seems that Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is the second messenger for the LH secretion (see excerpt below) I just don't know if it is ""rate limiting"". If it is... could PDE5 inhibitors prolong the anabolic effects of a D-AA supplement... much the way that MAOI's prolong the effects of things like Caffeine?

&gt;&gt;In humans and rats, whereas in rat testis Leydig cells, it increases the synthesis and release of testosterone and cAMP is implicated as second messenger. In the pituitary and in testes D-Asp is synthesized by a D-aspartate racemase which convert L-Asp into D-Asp.

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774316/)


I could see this being usefull by making individuals that strive to derive anabolic effects from D-AA have higher levels of LH in their bloodstream for longer periods of time... or is LH more specifically for sex drive and thus prolonging cAMP would be a better way to prolong elevated T levels???

I also exercise regularly (mostly lifting weights), eat reasonably well, and don't have any other symptoms of depression.

I read Herman's [super awesome long list in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/mvt6j/sexual_performance_enhancers/) but there are so many things listed that I'm not sure how many of those I should take

I know there are the basics, creatine, fish/flax/etc oils, multi's, etc.)?

For example

* Zinc = at night
* Melatonin = empty stomach
* GABA = without protein
* Vitamin D = with fat
* Calcium = with food
* l-tyrosine = can block absorption of other aminos if taken in high or chronic doses.
* casein = night

I understand that this question is ridiculously broad, maybe we could have a Absorption/Timing FAQ or something?  Searching the web for each and every supplement is quite cumbersome, but it's terrible for people that just don't know.  It's amazing how different the results are when you search, ""what shouldn't I take with creatine/don't take with creatine"" vs "" Creatine caffeine.""

1375998884.0,1jzhbk,What supplements will help me take my next step??,ItsMachu,12,2,17,"Whats up guys

Ok i've always been an active person

Turn clock forward to last May I was 20 years old 6-1 and 255 lbs.  That summer is where I made monumental changes, high protein and took up running as a hobby.  After running about 3 miles 5 times a week and a very strict diet, by the time August came around and it was time to head back to college, I had dropped my mile from ~10min to 7:01 (PR) and lost 50 lbs.  The transformation was unreal.

While at college I play club ice hockey practicing 2 times a week plus 2 games on the weekend, running and maintaining a good diet I was able to maintain my weight dropping to as low as 205 lbs for the rest of the year. 

Now fast forward to this summer, hectic work schedules, and aggravating an old shoulder injury we stopped with 9 days left in the program, and I've decided to just keep running for exercise until I go back to school.  For the most part i'm happy with the results, showing obvious loss of body fat and increase in muscle tone.  

Now that i'm close to my goal weight ~200 lbs i'm looking to really get into a good lifting routine as well as play hockey when I return to school next week.  I want to continue toning and really focus on gaining muscle.  I've been doing some research lately on bodybuilding.com and created a BodySpace account and also downloaded the iPhone app.  While on body space I found ""Steve Cooks Big Man On Campus"" workout which I plan on starting on August 18th

My biggest questions have to do with supplements.  What should I be taking?? My knowledge goes as far as knowing to drink a whey protein shake after lifting and that's about it.   I found this MusclePharm supplement stack http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/musclepharm/ufc-fight-stack.html that seems to be a really good bang for my buck and has a lot of good things inside it
Amino1, and Z-core PM. Also in my ""wishlist"" are fish oil gel capsules.  

Are these supplements what I should be taking? Is this a good stack (I already own a tub of protein)? And if so

I hope I can give a level-headed review of the product.  DISCLAIMER: I am sure that people reading this have different fitness goals so I will refrain from calling my observations ""pros"" or ""cons.""

**About me**: I am 5'9 and 150 lbs.  I rowed for a year+ in college and before that played a year of basketball and football in high school.  I am naturally skinny/fit thanks to good genetics

**My workout routine**: I could only work out one day a week during my time taking c4 so this is what I did.  Squats/deadlifts to start; bench press superset with bent-over rows; barbell curls superset with close-grip bench press (tris); ab circuit (cable crunch, reverse crunches on pull-up bar, etc.).  All exercises are working set of 6 reps except for ab circuit which I do 20 reps.

**Other supplements**: When I started c4

**Other PWOs that I tried**: I have tried No-xplode (3 times without the caffeine), BRX (2 or 3 times).  I stopped No-xplode because it upset my bowel movements and it made me feel really tight and hot/sweaty too early in my workout.  I stopped neurotech because of 1,3 dimeth in it.  I stopped BRX because it also made me really sweaty early on.  I stopped 1mr because it gave me EXPLOSIVE and painful diarrhea.


***REVIEW*** (sorry it's taking a while to get here):

**Dosage**: I found that one scoop was enough in the beginning

**Timing**: Again, but later the effects were less pronounced and probably took more like 30 minutes to kick in.

**Potency**: As you can tell, I would take it and feel the right effects, but later on it was more difficult to get that same level.  Because of my work schedule, I could only use it once a week before my sunday lift.

**What did I feel?**:

I generally felt a bit more motivated to lift and more confident that I could push myself without hitting that wall of fatigue or indifference.

I also felt a subtle increase in energy - not quite a wired feeling that some may want

I did not receive much if any pump/tingles/etc.  This was nice because I am not someone looking to bulk up too dramatically and when I did feel that in other products

And whether it was the workout or the aftereffects of c4

**Side effects?**: Increased libido in general.  Trouble falling asleep.


*I know everyone loves ratings and whatnot so I will give a quick breakdown here (please take this lightly because I think my anecdotal review is more helpful):*

**ENERGY**: 8/10 (wasn't overwhelming and felt natural - decreased with time)

**FOCUS**: 9/10 (generally felt motivated and rarely quit a workout - decreased with time)

**PUMP**: 2/10 (I did not get any pump)

**SIDE EFFECTS**: 7/10 (no upset stomach


**Would I recommend?**:  Yes, and (3) has a sensitive stomach.

Supps I have (or are on their way) are: Green tea extract, DAA, PES erase, Grape seed extract, Calcium, magnesium, Vitamin D, Zinc

My plan is as follows:

8AM: Multivitamin, 60mg methyl-synephrine, Green tea extract, CAF extract

After this I will do some LISS cardio for about 30-45 minutes

4.30PM: Preworkout meal of a protein shake and some fruit (~600-700 calories)

5.30PM: Green tea extract then go do workout (M/W/F weights

8.30PM: Post workout meal (~700-800 calories), Magnesium and Zinc

10:30PM: Calcium and Vitamin D

Is it worth running the DAA and Erase on top of this as well? I was running these plus creatine until I started to notice my hair thinning a bit

My reasoning behind the whole shebang is this: Compound 20 is a B2 adrenergic agonist

Green tea before exercise to increase thermogenesis

CAF extract is an appetite suppressant and helps mobilise fat stores

Methyl-synephrine is a B2/B3 agonist

Vitamin D, calcium, fish oil and multivitamin are just for general health and wellbeing.

I've been trying to read up on how to approach supplements

From what I have gathered, it tastes good, etc. Since I am getting low on what protein I have(AMP), this is sitting in my Amazon cart currently.

So does that make for a decent pre-workout drink? Should I go further? My roommate has a new thing of Xtend, should I do it instead of the Protein? Or should I mix it with the protein? Should I drink it all before starting, or do more of an intra-workout thing with it? Or do I separate them all? Would mixing all of the above in milk be okay if i need more calories/protein for the day?

I've been hesitant to try any of the specific pre-workout supps because I normally don't start working out till 4 PM and I am rather sensitive to Caffeine. Well, and losing 100 pounds). I had considered moving my workouts to the morning to avoid this issue, but this conflicts with my workout partners' schedule a little, and i have been considering trying leangains, but that would not mesh well together either(ugh, so many conflicting options!) since I don't want my eating window to be completely encompassed by my 8 hours at work.

According to the [PDF mention is this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/psdez/interesting_independent_discussion_of_various/) (a document for US Miltary Divers

""Scientiﬁc Evidence: Very few scientiﬁc studies have examined the efﬁcacy of synephrine with regard 
to weight loss. One animal study using rats considered the hemodynamic effects of synephrine 
treatment in portal hypertensive rats (2). In this study
hyperkinetic state in both portal vein ligation and bile duct ligation rats. The mean arterial 
pressure in both groups was signiﬁcantly reduced
resistance. 

The study concluded that an eight-day administration of synephrine had a beneﬁcial 
hemodynamic effect in both groups of rats. A human study was conducted to determine the 
cardiovascular effects of synephrine on normotensive adults (3). Subjects consumed 8 ounces of 
Seville orange juice and water in a cross-over method followed by another ingestion 8 hours later. 
A signiﬁcant increase in heart rate
pressure was noted in response to ingestion of the Seville orange juice. 

In a review by Preuss et al. (2), randomized 
study using a combination of Citrus aurantium
a restricted diet was described. Participants receiving the supplement combination had 
signiﬁcantly greater fat losses
The review also describes a study involving female participants who were given no supplement 
the ﬁrst week of a weight loss regime and Citrus aurantium the second week. During the ﬁrst 
week, mean weight loss was 
2.40 kg (2). 

The researchers felt this was signiﬁcant because typically more weight is lost in the 
ﬁrst week of a diet protocol, Citrus

Hey there Reddit.

My name is Colin Popell. 

I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company

A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing

So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.

**How are we going to do this?** I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.

We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers

**Where do we want to go with this?** Well, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.

I’m a transhumanist too, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.

**How can you help us?** Pretty easy, but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.

Sorry, new supplement company wants to set a scientific and business standard, wants your business, wants to support the community, and wants data on your nootropic habits.

From what it seems from the Lyle Mcdonald FAQ's thread, its best to take it fasted in the morning pre-cardio, and at night post-dinner time on non-cardio days as the dose may be too intense prior to a weight training workout, and being on keto with the possible addition of TKD may negate the effects of Yohimbine once I take in some high-glycemic food.",,,,

I've been bodybuilding and conditioning for years with wonderful results, it's largely an osmotic laxative that draws water into the colon and clears things out. Heavily diuretic

The first thing that happened was, and I looked instantly shredded. I lost 3-5lbs of water weight, and my muscles looked the same. After a week, however, the effects evened out on my skin, and I started having a couple of heart arrhythmias at random throughout the day. I read this could be from dehydration or low sodium or potassium balance. I already did drink lots of water evenly spaced throughout the day (10-15 8oz cups minimum), so I upped my sodium intake and supplemented with potassium

2-3 weeks out, look as big, and during workouts, I don't get the same level of pump no matter what I do. I didn't really lose any strength. I had to lay off a couple of exercises I needed to get back into, but for the most part it was all comparable. My bench didn't skip a beat, nor did anything else I kept to, but the visual muscle loss was everywhere

My main question is whether or not this could be similar to the effects of coming off of Creatine and losing the water it packed into the muscle. I'm mostly concerned because I'm hoping once I'm better

* Whey protein is for building muscle. Though I am not a body builder and don't aim to bulk up as such. I just have a high metabolism and am quite skinny. I've found that general weight exercise and whey protein helps me bulk out and not look too slim. Also whey protein is great for hair growth.

I'm not sure how true or false any of this stuff is, because milk already has creatine in it and adding creatine to it would break it down to creatinine. Second, people suggested that you just flat out take creatine and whey protein separate since the taste would be disgusting. Third, they suggested that if you do take creatine and whey protein, drink juice before hand as it would help the creatine absorb better. I'd rather just take the whey protein and creatine together combined with milk as that's what fits my routine best, but if that will make taking the creatine inefficient, I'd rather do the method that will put my money to good use.

My goals are:

- General Health
- Increasing muscle mass and strength
- More energy
- Better focus and concentration

Questions: 

- What would you guys add/remove from the stack

- What do you guys think of the dosage? I think the melatonin might be a bit much but I think I'm happy with everything else.

- Should I add either the Piracetam or the Choline? I have a fair amount of each laying around and I'm currently taking no Choline with this stack. [Dosage would be taken from here.](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/54322-piracetam-dosage-why-you-should-be-taking-48-grams-dose/)

It's also absolutely disgusting. So not viable (yet...I'm still hoping big pharma develops it into a pill-form at the local pharmacy!).


**Probiotics** won't do it.  Though they still can have many benefits




**Eating dirt** is a hopeful option.  Similarly, eating **unwashed, muddy vegetables** straight from the backyard garden.  THESE ARE POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS.

Lastly, as well as simply interacting with children, livestock and pets, can foster increased gut biodiversity.  As far as I can tell, this seems like the best option..

If you avoided antibiotics, your gut health is probably superb and you don't need to worry about this.  However, just one round of antibiotics permanently alters the gut flora.

* Creatine (monohydrate) from what I understand isn't harmful, after reading examine.com's article on Creatine, they note some medical concerns.

If anyone is really interested she has normal TSH and T4 but very low T3.  Hormone drugs have not had any benefit for her but I dont recall the two she tried.

I don't mind her experimenting with Iodine supplementation as long as her dose is in safe limits.  I just need some help determining what those are.

**TLDR;** Does anyone know of a good source that talks about upper limits of iodine consumption?

The best would be one that references Iodide(potassium salt).

**Anecdotal evidence:** I can't really speak to them individually

* **Morning:** obviously, but I have experienced a very noticeable increase in:

    (1) *Verbal acuity* - my sentence form, &amp; flow work in a much more harmonious nature. It's probably my favorite effect

    (2) *More intelligent prioritization and organizational skills*, I tend to focus too much or too little time on certain tasks. Since starting my nootropic regimen, I have started balancing that much better - to the extent that other people (friends, boss, etc) are taking notice

    (3) *Motivation* - I don't really have many days where I'm dragging ass. I'm very much on the ball and eager to conquer the day.

    (4) *Alertness* - the effects take place approximately 20 minutes after ingestion. At that point

    (5) The yohimbine and caffeine serve two purposes: (1) the former kick starts my endothermic metabolism while I fast, I won't speak to it directly. That being said, I feel they're both pivotal in helping boost cutting while simultaneously bulking.

* **Midday:** I honestly can't speak to CoQ10 or vitamin D, naturally moisturized), nails (stronger), &amp; hair (feels very supple and full) seem to be affected the most. I didn't get any colds/flu over the season, and that is very atypical, though I can't logically attribute all of that it to just fish oil. Re: CoQ10 &amp; vitamin D, I've read great things about the former

* **Afternoon:** no major anecdotes other than taming appetite. The main goal here is to give a slight kick to endothermic metabolism before my workouts.

* **Night:** my sleeping patterns are measurably more restful. I have an app (Sleep as Android) that records my level physical movements &amp; auditory accompaniments each night, and even your own will vary on factors I have yet to determine - some mornings I wake up VERY groggy. I occasionally depend on my morning stack to get me going

* **Custom pre &amp; peri workout mix**: this has been huge. I noticed right away how much energy it was supplementing during my workouts, but once I started the custom mix, I didn't do a single reset until I hit 285, and that's only been once. I highly recommend it.",,False,,False,t3_rurvm

But my questions are these:

**1) How much fish oil is too much? I take a large swig of oil every day. Which probably amounts to 4-6 tablespoons. Which is many times the recommended dosage. Is this OK? I feel best when I take it in pretty large volumes. But I do not want over dose and cause toxicity. Specially since the liver oil is also very high in vitamin A.**

**2. Should I start taking vitamin D3 or something like that

**3. What is the difference between Vitamin D3 and the Vitamin D in fish oil?**

**4. Do you also need sunlight or will Vitamin D supplementation sufficient?**

I recently ordered some D-Aspartic Acid after reading [Silverhydra's post.](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/05/d-aspartic-acid-and-the-secret-to-italian-loving/) (It was kind of a impulse purchase to be honest.)


My order is due to arive in a couple days and I just want to nail down a plan before it arrives.


So from what I've gathered

***
I plan on taking 2g a day and combine it with the 26mg of zinc / day I already take.


I reduced the dosage to 2mg because:

* I'm not that big (5'10.5''
* I don't have some crazy aromatase inhibitor.

***

Questions:

* How was your experience with D-Aspartic Acid?
* Does my plan seem sensible?
* What kind of a cycle should I be looking at?


Thanks in advance
