1351101559.0,120mtk,The experience of boys teasing girls,hflldjts258,72,14,13,"I have never understood the ""boys will be boys"" attitude

In my experience, ""Stop it!"" or even ""Leave me alone!"" early in the interaction and I guess the adults nearby are just hoping the kids will ""work it out themselves."" In my opinion, if the boy continues after the girl asks him to stop, the adult needs to intervene and say, ""[Boy's name], [girl's name] has asked you to stop. Please respect her request or you will go to timeout."" Don't wait for the girl to tattle/get help to make him stop or cry (which is often what the boy wants--kind of disturbing). Respect is highly emphasized with little kids in preschool and early elementary so I don't think  it would be difficult to implement. I think it is very important for adults to send the message to children that it is not okay to taunt others.

When I was in third grade, and we would say, ""Stop it! Just shut-up!"" then all the boys would be like, ""Oh, did you hear that? She wants to meet me in bed in 10 minutes!"" Whether they knew exactly what that meant or not, I'm not sure. I don't even remember if I truly understood. I just knew something about it was bad and embarrassing, and soon, the girls would either remain silent or try saying things like, well, too

To me, it's probably going to be along the lines of ""just ignore him, and he'll stop."" It may have worked in elementary school when the boy was ""being funny"" or wanting ""attention,"" but it is no longer so ""harmless""--it is a violation. In some ways, my third-grade example reminds me of the ""no means no"" concept. Girls are saying ""no"" or ""shut-up"" and the boys are saying, ""no means yes"" or ""shut-up means meet me in the bed in 10 minutes.""

I believe people need to start talking to boys (and men) about how act appropriately instead of sending the message to girls that they need to learn how to 'react' appropriately. I don't want my son teasing anybody. If a kid is teasing someone

TLDR: I don't think girls being told to ignore boys' teasing is sending a good message to either party.",,t5_2t857,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/120mtk/the_experience_of_boys_teasing_girls/

Essentially, but quite often, by sheer force of numbers, they drown out women's perspectives which I'd be interested in reading. They may also discourage some less confrontational women from giving their opinions at all. Obviously it's not up to me whether guys end up overrunning this place, but I don't want to be too big a part of that, so I'm trying to figure out a way to contribute sensitively without sanitising my opinions to the point where it's no longer worthwhile. If it isn't possible, I think it's probably better just to establish that and stick to lurking.  

So: how do you view men's role in this kind of forum? To what extent do you value our contributions? What raises your hackles or makes you wary?

* What should the terms of the new subreddit be? My suggestion is a strict limit to acceptable self-posts (no haircuts, no ""ow my cramps are so bad"" posts). Suggestions so far: a stipulation about aggregating copycat posts into one thread instead of clogging the queue (thanks aktuarie)


* Does anyone want to moderate? I've been a redditor for about 5 years but I've never actually modded a subreddit and don't have any CSS experience (though I'd be willing to learn)

* Does the subreddit name appeal to y'all?

* For sidebar links, a link to /r/2xlookbook, a link to /r/TwoXChromosomes itself and....? (suggestions so far: /r/FancyFollicles, /r/RedditLaqueristas)

I was reading the post by rebcart about some of the reasons why women don't speak up on the internet

I am non-competitive, when necessary. I pride myself on my conflict resolution skills, and I get upset when I think someone else is mad at me. That being said, I'm in my final year as an engineering student and my upbringing has never given me any reason to doubt that I can do anything a man can do. 

What I want to hear opinions on is, on your own? Is there really such a big difference? Growing up in modern society, it took me a long time to admit that I'm *not* competitive or super ambitious, and frankly, it makes me feel a little like I'm wasting some advantages that women before me have fought for. Still, this is how I am, and I shouldn't be made to feel bad about it any more than women who want to be CEOs should be made to feel bad.

Whether we are abolitionists or for the legalization of prostitution, whether we are housewives or bmx-riders, whether we read Vogue or Philosophy journals, I know there are some things we can all unite over, enjoy discussing and find thought-provoking. While still acknowledging that many of us are not only different women but also different people.

I'm asking because I strongly believe that the personal is political. I'm curious about one's insurance policy affects birth control pricing

I'll start! I currently pay ~$5/mo for a progesterone only pill which was prescribed to me at my university's student health center. I used to pay $10/mo for yaz

I have always had very painful periods but for a long time no one would believe me. My mom thought I was trying to make up a reason to start the pill and my doctor was not interested in investigating underlying causes. I was told that my pain was normal. *It was not normal*. I had disabling cramps, but I put up with it because I didn't think there were any alternatives. I finally found a doctor who was willing to listen to me this year and she thinks that I have endometriosis. I don't have a period with my new pill and it is such a relief. I am so angry about being belittled, mistrusted, and discounted all these years though. 

I'm upperish class, and pass as straight. My health insurance is through a parent's job with the federal government. I know that I a very privileged but I still had to deal with a lot of bullshit. As a teenager I felt judged for taking birth control. Everyone assumed that I only wanted the pill so I could have sex (why is that even bad?) and that attitude had very real, very painful health costs.

I've only dated and had sex with men

So

1. What is your gender?
2. What do you rank on the [Kinsey scale](http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html)?
3. Have you ever messed around/had sex with a person of the same gender (or opposite
4. What conclusions did you draw from that/those experience(s)? (e.g. it was great
5. How would you feel if you had strictly homosexual/heterosexual relations for the rest of your life? Have you made plans to accomodate bisexual tendencies even if you find a life partner?

I'm wondering if there are any other self-described feminists here on femmit who feel that they fully understand the seriousness of the issue of consent but still ""throw caution to the wind"" in their personal lives by having sex while under the influence or by having sex without specifically saying ""Yes"" or without asking their partner if they will consent to sex.

I personally have had a conversation about implied consent with my fiance years ago in which I've stated ""If I say yes while drunk, etc."" if it's unwanted. It's been brought up a few more times since by each of us while discussing feminist issues, political issues and sometimes as an aside from listening to a podcast on the issue. I personally feel like I've covered my bases by having this conversation multiple times while recognizing that such a conversation is not necessarily right for everyone.

So is there anyone else here who is in the same boat? Do you feel comfortable about your choice within the context of your relationship but not necessarily within the context of feminist identity? Or are you 100% comfortable with your decision? (I personally would say I'm 100% comfortable with my choice in the context of my relationship but sometimes I feel like it does conflict with how I feel about myself as a feminist).

She was found a foster home, homeless shelter, and to fix houses for those in need. She even became a mentor for Autistic children. 
&gt;""She perservered obviously through tough times getting here, get top grades, take the hardest classes we could offer here at Grand Haven, and she did it. She just had an incredible drive."" 

Now she is attending Western Michigan University

Up until now, finding true love, bettering herself and helping those in need. She has been a personification of Mental Strength. 

But this isn’t the end of the story. Now ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) wants to deport her. She has been denied every attempt at staying. They denied her to stay for her marriage

Cayla did not come here of her own free will. She was tossed away, alone and lost.  After her rescue, she flourished in a loving environment. Now we all risk throwing her away again.  The Snakeheads have threatened her for years, if she is deported, she risks their retaliation. If she were lucky enough to avoid that, there is that issue of her father. 

&gt;""There's no home for you here anymore, either I will kill you, cuz there's no home for you here anymore, or I will just give you a bottle of medicine and you can take care of it yourself, just kill yourself."" 

If she eludes her father and the Snakeheads, she would be living in fear for her life. 

But this doesn’t have to happen. The Obama administration has created something for ICE called “[Prosecutorial Discretion]( http://www.ice.gov/doclib/secure-communities/pdf/prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf)” for cases such as this. It is supposed to be exercised to block deportation of people who are at risk,000 cases reported to ICE for Prosecutorial Discretion, only 7.5% of them have been approved. Given her track-history with ICE, the outlook is grim. 

This is where you can come in. Do you wish to help Cayla
If you can think of any other ways to help

I have always been very passionate about class issues. I come from a working class family, which has furthered my beliefs. 

I love being a feminist, white perspective. For example, the idea of corporate advancement as a sign of success. The discussion focuses mostly on salaries and CEO positions. While I definitely understand that this is important, I find when the feminist narrative revolves around these issues, it is very exclusionary to women outside the educated, white-collar, middle-class spectrum. If we continue to measure these signifiers as an indication of the success of women

Many months ago, I believe, by [Toni Weschler and her book](http://www.tcoyf.com/) ). I did some online research, bought the book, and devoured it. It was fascinating to find out so much about how our bodies and menstrual cycles work, and how (with discipline and the right tools) you can chart your fertility to use as birth control. I told my boyfriend all about it and he was eager to learn with me and help me out in any way (background info: we'd been dating for about a year, are condom users interested in condomless sex as long as it's safe)

I was talking about the book/method a few months later with a close friend of mine. She seemed very interested to learn about it, but she said ""oh, put it in your bag so [her boyfriend] doesn't see it."" I told her I don't mind if he sees it, and she said ""no, I mean, it would be weird if he saw that I had that.""

I know it doesn't sound like much, how much in love they are, how it feels like they've been together forever. Of course every relationship is different, but I wish she felt like it was normal to talk to him about birth control beyond whatever they already use (I assume condoms). They said ""I love you"" to each other very early in their relationship, but sex still came first. I wish it were easier for women to be open about knowing about their bodies and cycles.

[Link to the video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/31886254). Also


This is a link to an interview that my classmates and I made

One thing that also interested me about them was their backgrounds. One is a young woman, and works alongside her husband. And one is a woman who grew up in the art 'scene', who is married *but* they also share a girlfriend. I couldn't believe how awesome it was that my friends and I each chose an artist who was so different. It was a really great and enlightening day (we did all the interviews over a course of 12 hours, but don't worry, the video is only 13 minutes long if you choose to watch), and I'll never forget it.


I guess some of the discussion questions I'd like to ask Femmit are:

*How do you perceive the differences in art by women or art by men?

*Do you think there are any? 

*Do you think it has more to do with age and/or ambition?

*If you are into art or art history

*Did you know there are a lot of famous artists that cross-dressed? Some even in the early 1900s!

1. Have you had a horrible experience at a hairdressers?  

2. What tips/tricks do you have to get the best out of your hairdresser?  

I'll start. I should preface this by saying I have generalized anxiety and social anxiety. I hate getting my hair cut. I think this stems from being embarrassed by a hairdresser when I was little and had headlice once.  

TL;DR down the bottom  

My worst hairdressing experience happened earlier this year. I was new to the area and didn't know where to go. I'd let my hair grow out far too long for my liking (as usual) so I was desperate for a cut.  

I chose a place that was nice looking without being over-the-top fancypants. The hairdresser was male and very outspoken. I told him exactly what I wanted: much shorter so I didn't have to tie it up for work

It was at that point that I should have walked out

So I sit there while he gives me a 30 minute shampoo/head massage

I'm a university TA for a class on individual sustainability. I've designed a thought-provoking assignment for my students to get them to start reflecting on the cultural construction of gender. 

Phase 1 and 2 have them conducting a series of self reflections, kissing in public, etc...) This would ultimately allow them to truly experience what its like to be in the others' shoes. However, since this is not a 'Gender &amp; Sexuality' class, I feel uncomfortable commissioning a drag assignment.

How can I really drive home the cultural construction of gender by allowing them to experience another gender/sexual orientation besides their own? ",,t5_2t857,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/femmit/comments/1c3j1t/gender_sexuality_assignment/
