So here it is. Step one: warm up your pan over medium-medium high heat with some fat and garlic in it. 

Step two: put in your veggies and saut√©e until there is some color on one side

Step three: pour some white wine in the pan until the bottom is covered well. Put a lid on to cover it

Step four: Remove the lid

Stir it up, asparagus, bell peppers, and mushrooms and all have been divine. 

EDIT: I don't use the liquid that's left over. He likes to reduce it to a sauce though.

**My note to them:**

&gt;Hello
 
&gt;I love Chipotle and have eaten at Chipotle restaurants many, but I stick with the carnitas due to the soybean oil.
&gt; 
Soybean oil is considered to be unhealthy by many
 
&gt;I know that Chipotle has a huge following in the ""paleo"" community, it's well-known that only the pork at Chipotle is paleo-friendly. 

&gt;Chipotle would generate a ton of good-will from health-conscious folks by elimanating the soy oil and putting steak back on the menu for people like me. 

&gt;Best!
 
&gt;Mike


**Their reply:**

Michael
 
I'm happy to report that we are on the same page! We are actually working on replacing our soybean oil with non-GMO sunflower oil to fry our taco shells and chips in the following areas and locations:
 
Stores in Washington 

Stores in Oregon 

Stores in California 

Stores in Nevada 

Stores in Phoenix 

Stores in Texas 

Stores in Arkansas 

Stores in Louisiana 

Stores in Alabama 

Stores in Georgia 

Stores in Tennessee 

Stores in North Carolina 

Stores in South Carolina 

Stores in Virginia 

Stores in Washington DC 

Stores in Virginia Beach 

Stores in Maryland 

Stores in Philadelphia

All Florida restaurants
 
As of 9/25/11:
Stores in Denver

As well as our Wilton, CliftonPark and Univofroch locations.
 
We are also making the transition to non-GMO rice bran oil. As of August 24th 2012, steak and barbacoa is marinated in the adobo marinade containing rice-bran oil, they may still come into contact with the soy used on our grill. 

We plan to completely replace our soybean oil with our sunflower and rice bran oils. I would recommend asking your local Chipotle to see where they are in this transition as this is an ongoing process. In the meantime
 
Chips

Crispy corn taco shells

Rice

Fajita vegetables

Black beans

Pinto beans

Carnitas

Chicken

Steak

Barbacoa

Chipotle honey vinaigrette

Large and Small Flour Tortillas
 
The following items are NOT made with soybean oil
 
Mild tomato salsa

 Medium corn-poblano salsa

 Green chile tomatillo salsa

 Red chile tomatillo salsa

 Guacamole

 Cheese

 Sour cream

 Lettuce
 
I hope this information proves helpful Michael. Have a lovely day!

This was fine until I became obese and couldn't lose the weight by exercise or diet restriction. Something was OBVIOUSLY wrong. I was an athlete for crying out loud. My own MD tried to put me on statins. My Triglycerides were over 300 and my HDL was under 40. I was 35. 

It isn't that MD's don't get the biochemistry. Trust me

I've been trained to be some semblance of a respectable authority on peoples health. I'm (or was ) a liar made legitimate by virtue of a degree. I should have listened to my mother when all she served was meat, and a little rice. 

Rest assured. ALL MD's are not fools who are unwilling to step back and reassess. The evidence is building and the tide is beginning to turn. I fear that until the NIH begins to fund research in the area of grain elimination and higher fat eating habits the general public will still think that fat is bad. 

FYI I just realized this about 1 month ago when I was researching diets incorporating (whatever the cereal which compares itself with an egg is). I was directed to this sub-reddit by google and someone ranting about the evils of grains and etc. So I looked up paleo and read Sisson and Cordain. Then I read ""Wheat Belly"". I was still wrestling with the amount of fat in the diet. Then I got a hold of Taubes which blew my mind. Then I watched the video about fructose and HFCS. 

My fiancee is pissed at me because she loves her sweets. The other MD's I work worth are leery of me although they have commented about my ""wasting away to nothing."" I've lost 30 lbs in month on grass fed beef and buffalo, eggs, pork belly, and veggies. 

So thank you for vociferously expounding on the evils of whole grains. Thank you for not shutting up and listening to nay-sayers and experts. 

EDIT 1: I am not saying that appropriate drugs do not have their place or that they cannot be beneficial. I'm saying that preventing disease is much preferable to treating disease.

**Enthusiastic Paleo N00b:  Hi everyone! I've recently started eating according to the paleo lifestyle

PaleoWizard: Is that grass-fed beef? If not

I_grok_all: No way, grass-fed isn't enough. A true paleo dinner would contain only grass-fed Montana-bred meat.

F_all_yall:  Come on

Paleo_4_strife: I don't see what the fuss is. I only eat raw mammoth meat and wild cabbage.

PaleoWizard: Enthusiastic Paleo N00b

All other users: We agree. This person can't possibly be paleo.**

What this comes down to is a choice between two major strategies in paleo eating: optimization and satisficing. Optimization, where the problem space is small and the number of possible solutions is relatively low. As the problem space increases, along with the number of parameters and possible outcomes, optimization becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming. If faced with the problem of monetary resources, a person who chooses optimization will never, ever stop trying to make his or her pile of money larger.

Herb Simon, people generally reach a threshold and then stop striving to gain more. Faced with the problem of money, most people are satisficers rather than optimizers.

My issue with paleo is that its culture is one of optimization. Yes, seems to reward the sort of person who measures out their quantities of food with a scale and measuring cup, constantly trying to titrate their health, aiming for some place of perfection. This approach is, to me, a horror, but I recognize that optimizers don't typically do this because of compulsion but rather because they enjoy it! I get that. I do the same sort of thing with hobbies of mine

I understand, this fine chemistry of your body is an enjoyable pursuit, something that you find rewarding in and of itself. When you choose to project that finely-honed optimization on others in the community, though -- others who want merely to join in the joy of finally learning what makes their bodies feel good -- you create hostile exclusion and ostracization. Perhaps not to a severe extent -- we aren't Mean Girls -- but the effect is chilling nonetheless. When someone enthusiastically says ""Hey, I quit eating gluten, and my headaches went away!"" and you say ""Heh, until you quit rice, potatoes, you minimized the importance of their discovery. We all know how harmful gluten is, you set yourself apart from them

Why do some optimizers (I should emphasize that there are preachy optimizers just as there are preachy satisficers) tear down the well-meaning paleo n00bs?  I don't know. One hypothesis is that the veterans really feel a responsibility to teach the rookies about True Paleo (whatever that means) as early as possible, but I find it considerably more likely that it's a smug superiority, not unlike that of hybrid car owners and judgmental Christians.

This is my gripe with the paleo community (particularly this subreddit) at large. In general, though, it turns into a prick-waving contest of who is the Most Paleo and who is merely Using the Buzzword.",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/10arf4/more_paleo_than_thou_my_gripe_with_the_paleo/

I spent the last 45 minutes of the movie holding in painful gas. (I was in the center of the theater and couldn't really get up and go).

When the movie ended

I rode home feeling like it wasn't over

My gut is still unhappy with me today. I look and feel super bloated. Ugh. I fed my gut flora tons of undigestible starch and it blew the fuck up. What a mistake.

I learned my lesson. In this instance I treated Paleo less like a lifestyle I live for the benefits and more like a diet I can cheat on without experiencing any real harm.

I obviously learned that my body will not allow me to make poor food choices without the consequence of great discomfort.

1375373921.0,1ji2vw,What I learned about food and my body in a month of paleo,Alexander2011,226,29,89,"I just finished my first month of paleo eating -- I complied strictly -- and I learned a lot about food and my body. While I understand that everyone's different and thus my discoveries might not apply to everyone

1. I don't need grains to live happily, I found, aren't evil -- when I have a little bit of fruit sugar with meals (even while totally eliminating other sugars), I have higher energy, better workouts, and actually *less* trouble losing fat.

2. Processed food is really unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel well.

3. Healthy fats might be healthy, they add up quickly. Half a pound of almond butter is really, really easy for me to eat, and though it's paleo-friendly, it's still 1600 calories.

4. I'm a good cook

5. ""Full"" is the feeling past ""sated

6. Life is better with lots of hard workouts

7. This one's crucial: food exists to serve me, how I'd cook dinner, how many calories I had left, and how I could create paleo-compliant versions of non-paleo foods. That, I realized, is the exact opposite of the liberation I expected, so decided to simplify. The paleo plan is designed to make us happy and healthy, don't get me wrong, especially because I -- and I predict many of the others willing to eat and exercise carefully and precisely for a month are probably the same way -- am rather compulsive.

I worked out three days a week and had a calorie deficit each day but nothing ever changed. 

This spring my family doctor noticed my thyroid being really enlarged (like twice the size of a normal thyroid) and sent me back to my endocrinologist. Bloodwork still coming back normal, it wasn't cancer but it went largely unexplained and my doc basically sent me away with a shrug after more normal bloodwork like ""Well that's weird"". 

Anyway, eating super healthy (or so I thought), took some vitamin supplements, and I did drop two or three pounds, but it was really frustrating because I thought I was doing everything right for around 5 months and still seeing almost zero results. Then I found this subreddit. 

Started strictly eating Paleo almost two months ago. All my symptoms have stopped. **Every. Single. Symptom.** I don't understand the science. All I know is that I feel awesome, and I've dropped about 13 pounds in that frame of time eating the same amount of calories I had been eating before (and still counting! am feeling so ambitious in my progressing fitness I preregistered for a Tough Mudder in April to keep myself motivated). The tumor is now half it's previous size, and my thyroid is the size of a normal human being's thyroid instead of a trolls. 

IT IS MAGIC. 

This diet combined with a fairly strict workout regimen has been absurdly beneficial for me. Not only is my health vastly improved

Do you guys know if thyroid issues can be tied to a gluten sensitivity? I haven't been able to find very much information on it in my admittedly limited research. I'm just so happy about this change in my life. I thought I was screwed for life with all these shitty symptoms and nothing to help me since they couldn't figure out what was wrong. Now I just...I just feel awesome. So,,False,self,t5_2qzzs,False,,True

Although I'm not overweight

*I had no energy.

*I was a slave to caffeine.

*I got headaches and shakes without sugar and carbs.

*I had to eat AT LEAST every 3 hours or I felt lightheaded.

*I used terrible pre-workout drinks just to get through my lifts and runs.

*I had dermographism

*My best friend's girlfriend has rheumatoid arthritis and is only 21 years old.  Since it is an autoimmune disease

*My father has dietary woes

*I feel very strongly about the government not taxing fatty foods

Thanks to multiple books, I've stuck to the lifestyle and feel great.  Best of all, my DERMOGRAPHISM IS GONE!!! I used to be constantly drugged up on allergy medication. For 24/7, over 10 years, I didn't miss a single day.  I'm currently one week without allergy meds, and that alone feels unbelievable! 
To all of those who are on the fence of trying this lifestyle, it gets better.  Kick the sugar habit, including the fake sugar, and the cravings do go away.

Thank you all for the support!

There's gonna be a few TMI tags from here on in so be warned hahaha!

My son was 10 months when we started and one of the things that made me think about changing our way of eating was for him.  After eating bread, no Gerber crap).  He was also still mostly breastfed at a year, only eating about one big meal of solids a day (plus an occasional snack), so I was already trying to make sure those counted but cutting out the gluten/dairy really helped things for him.  He almost immediately stopped getting diaper rash!  We were using cloth at the time too (but have since switched to disposables...  Yeah I know bring out the pitchforks.)  These days the only time he gets an upset tummy is after visiting with the grandparents where they just think we're doing the diet for fun and don't respect our wishes.  I know that a bite of cookie or whatever wont kill him but the other day I had to flat out give shit to my MIL because she gave him chicken fingers and fries and guess what happened to the poor kid.

Another thing I've noticed is that a lot of parents of toddlers will complain of everything being mysteriously sticky.  Not with him.  It's grease.  If it's a messy fruit like banana it doesn't really get sticky.  It kind of hardens up and you just scrape it off haha.  No

He also LOVES food.  All sorts of food.  He doesn't eat much in a sitting but I'm so lucky to have the least picky baby I've ever met.  Even pre-paleo I didn't shy from spicing his food so I'm glad I didn't start out with a kid used to bland food.  But he eats almost anything except greens.  Yesterday we had mushroom and onion omelettes and he was picking out the onion to eat on their own!  He also knows so many words for different fruits/vegetables that when we go grocery shopping,"" ""carrot,"" ""tomato"" etc.  This makes me so proud not only for him but for us because there are some kids twice his age that still don't know their vegetables because they are never given any.

For myself, I find I have more patience now for my son's toddler antics, I don't snap at him as easily.

I had [chronic constipation](/tmi) pretty well my entire adult life, so painful.](/tmi)  I first started realizing it might be diet related when I was pregnant.  I had cut out canned foods and of course cut down on fast food a great deal.  I was eating much more fruit and drinking water.  I was actually much more regular when I was pregnant which is the complete opposite of what you hear from pregnant women hahaha!

So for me

My husband is doing great.  He looks and feels so much better about himself.  I've even seen him take his shirt off outside this summer!  He says ""well I've still got some to lose"" but I'm SO proud of him for what he's accomplished.  I think the reason he's plateaued is because we're still eating a fair bit of potato.  I don't know if he's going to try very low-carb but he might.  But once we can afford better option we're cutting out potato for sure.

Speaking of affordability:  Nothing quite makes you as aware of portion sizes as when you're broke!  Also, but will it fill you?  Not a chance.  We do hope to get a freezer soon so this fall I hope to get some local pork.  (We love pork around here.)  There's also a local bison farm, and an elk farm, as well as beef/pig/lamb so I'm eager to start shopping in larger quantities than just a pound or so here and there.  We also know lots of hunters (and my husband wants to hunt this fall) and have had to turn down meat because we don't have the space.  Not once we get a freezer!  Soon, it will be ours.

Another thing I've noticed is how vastly your view of what food is changes.  Now I get repulsed looking at pizza when before it made me drool.  For a while I missed baked goods but not only does GF baking suck, I get one of those 118ml Haagen Dazs icecreams with the spoon inside.  The strawberry kind is my favourite because the ingredient list is so small and yeah, it's a mega sugar rush, but it's such a small serving.  If I were to buy a tub there'd be NO WAY I'd be able to only have that much and be done (I have 0 willpower if it's in front of me/I have easy access.)

Yes we have slipped occasionally.  But we've never quite ""fallen off the wagon"" and I'm very proud of that.  It's been quite a year of learning and for my son, shrinking, and it's been great.  I wish our families understood what we're doing but we remember the days when we didn't think of food as fuel and not just gut-filler and we forgive them.  I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this subreddit when I did.  Actually, it was from hitting ""random"".  I read a little and it just instantly clicked.  I remember actually saying outloud ""THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.""  Been paleo ever since.

I know this will probably be down voted to oblivion

I have been following this paleo thing for a while, and I can't quite figure out why. The attitudes I have seen towards well-crafted scientific evidence concern me; it reminds me strongly of the creationist attitude toward scientific work.

Can we please discuss this problem? 

For instance, an epidemiologist at Harvard, showed very clearly that diets low in saturated fats were strongly associated with a decreased risk of coronary artery disease, one of the most prevalent and debilitating disorders in the modern world. There are literally hundreds of other studies showing the same thing. What does the paleo community think about this? If you think it's wrong or that you are somehow doing something that makes you immune to such adverse effects, what makes you so sure?

I DO NOT want to start a flame war. I would love to have a serious, I am worried about you guys and gals. As a medical student, I see people suffering from the metabolic and vascular complications of poor dietary choices every day. Many of these diseases are silent for decades, and by the time they raise their heads the smoking gun is often devastating. 

I want to be able to give my future patients advice about their dietary choices that is simple and based in evidence. I think there are a lot of great things about paleo

Prove to me that the paleo community is mature and willing to examine itself critically. Your long-term success depends on it!

* Meat:

Most of my grocery money is spent on meat. Meat is what‚Äôs going to keep you full. Veggies

**Ground**: Ground meat is extremely cheap and versatile. Ground beef has a prominent spot in my diet. I love it because it keeps me full for a long time and it can be used to cook a variety of dishes ‚Äì I never get bored eating the stuff. If you‚Äôre going to be eating a lot of grain-fed ground meat

**Whole chicken**: Whole chickens are inexpensive and just one bird provides you with multiple meals. The bones and small bits of meat that remain from the chicken can then be used to make a soup or stock.

* Awful offal

I know most people still have nightmares about being force-fed liver and onions as a child, tongue and brain are dense with nutrients and will do your body good.  

* Fat

I love butter‚Äôs fatty goodness and coconut oil is a luxury I am sometimes guilty of buying. However

* Vegetables:

I save money by buying frozen veggies. Yes, I splurge and buy luxuries like sweet potatoes and asparagus. Another trick to help you save some cash is to buy veggies that are in [season](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7YDpfoXlxqc/TyYUaLCTa0I/AAAAAAAAAyY/PMw7gRTiW5c/s1600/seasonality-of-fruits-and-vegetables.bmp).  

* Tips and tricks:

1. Eggs are your friends. They‚Äôre cheap, too! 
2. Keep an eye out for sales.
3. Plan your meals ahead of doing groceries. Walking around the store with your head cut off
4. Fast intermittently. Yeah

I'm in quite a rush and typed this up quickly. If you guys have any other tips

It‚Äôs been a while since someone has had some reasonable arguments against paleo.   At least you did your homework and thought critically about this.

&gt;So from what I understand

Yeah, cancer, diabetes, etc.  All of the ""new world diseases"".  The idea is that if you eat roughly the same foods as they ate, and are about as active, you stand a good chance of also being healthy.  People usually stick with this diet because they see some reduction or elimination of symptoms of modern day diseases like IBS, Chron‚Äôs, seasonal allergies, but regardless of the reason it seems to work.

&gt;First of all, a kill is somewhat rare, and especially for omnivorous humans without speed or strength or claws, it would seem even more so. The more likely scenario is that they would make an occasional large kill and feast on meat for a couple days before it spoiled, and go back to roots, nuts, berries, but I don't see mice as a big part of the paleo diet.

Humans seem to have a neat ability to track animals using the best weapon we have

&gt;‚ÄúWhen tracking an animal, one visualizes the motion of the animal and feels that motion in one‚Äôs own body. You go into a trancelike state, the concentration is so intense. It‚Äôs actually quite dangerous, because you become numb to your own body and can keep pushing yourself until you collapse.‚Äù [...] ‚ÄúWhen you track, you‚Äôre creating causal connections in your mind, because you didn‚Äôt actually see what the animal did,‚Äù Louis realized. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the essence of physics.‚Äù With speculative hunting

So to answer the ""difficult to hunt"" portion of it, are quite good at it, perhaps even adapted towards it much like lions and wolves are.

Regarding the ""how much meat did they really eat"" that really depends on location.  The actual diets of Paleolithic man varied greatly based on location.  We honestly don't know what people back in the Paleolithic era ate.  Aside from some DNA sampling and bone testing

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/3/682.full

Specifically this graph

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/3/682/F1.large.jpg

which shows that *all* studied hunter-gatherer societies (229) ate more than 16% of calories from hunted and fished food.  73% of which ate more than 50% of their calories from hunted and fished foods.  An important note, fruits, nuts, but also insects, reptiles, and small mammals that could be gathered instead of hunted.  So I think based on this data, that it is safe to say that meat was an important part of the hunter-gatherer diet.

As for rodents and insects not being part of the diet, even from people who advocate it, is the low calcium content in the diet by excluding dairy.  Perhaps these societies got their calcium from eating insects, or perhaps because they were eating significant amounts of vitamin K2, A (retinol not carotenes) and absorbing D, their calcium needs were less than what they are today with many of those being less or absent from current diets.  The Tarahumara in Mexico don‚Äôt consume any dairy but get their calcium by making their tortillas on rocks which contain a lot of calcium.  I wonder if they switched to using pots and pans instead of rocks if they would become calcium deficient.

&gt;Grains seem to be a big no-no, even looking at the teeth of lots of early skulls, they're worn down quite a bit to suggest lots of grinding type chewing. Likely seeds and grains.

Paleolithic man certainly ate grains, but one theory is that Paleolithic peoples would add sand or dirt to foods to help aid in the grinding process (mortar and pestle), and those bits would accelerate tooth wear.  Unwashed roots may also be a source.  We do know that once we moved from a hunter-gatherer life style to an agricultural life style, our life spans decreased, we got shorter, our bones became weaker, and we got more cavities.  I think this transition is particularly interesting because peoples back in those times had similar problems (no modern medicine, death from traumas, less veggies

&gt;Third, processed food in the world, I'm sure they'd eat it up.

Common causes of death for hunter-gatherer peoples were due to trauma (broken legs) and illness such as pneumonia or other infections.  The average age of 35 is somewhat misleading since much of the deaths were children.  Like wild animals, but life expectancy if you can make it to 15 was 55 years old.  I would love to see the age data on those 226 HG societies that were studied, and I wonder if anyone has put that together.  Back to the wild animal analogy, if you take wild animals and move them into captivity like a zoo, you are removing many of the causes of death.  Infection, trauma, starvation pretty much disappear, in most cases they develop other diseases and complications.  However

As for giving them processed foods, with fully developed skulls and straight, cavity free teeth.  The societies didn't suffer from modern diseases UNTIL processed white flour and sugar were added to the diets.  Their teeth became crooked, full of cavities, and rates of heart disease, cancer, etc went up.  This was back in the 30's so it was well before monster energy drinks, and lucky charms.  They simply replaced their micronutrient rich diets with empty calories from refined and processed grains and sugars.  That‚Äôs one of the reasons we have to fortify most of our breads

I think what all of this tells us is that adopting a diet consisting of whole foods and learning from healthy populations we may be healthier than our processed junk eating brothers and sisters.  Personally I think some grains can be part of a healthy diet, stone ground, and yeast risen.  If using wheat it should be the type that healthy populations eat (einkorn style).  If other grains like oatmeal, they should be also soaked/fermented into a porridge like dish.  While I don't consume grains, I find it difficult to argue against the low/moderate consumption of properly prepared heritage breed grains in the context of a healthy diet for those not suffering from gluten sensitivities.",,False,t5_2qzzs,True

This was me in November I was 192ish.
http://imgur.com/3ORus


Im pretty pic shy. The pic of me on the bike was right 'before' weight lifting and primal. It was taken in October at around 195ish. I'll take another pic this evening. 

I know I have some cheats. I'm basically paleo - but with dairy. I've really got no problems with dairy. I did eliminate it for 30 and I was miserable - glad to have it back with no ill effects. 

So

In June 2010

I was going up a flight of stairs

I decided right there to change.

I bought a bike from the LBS and started riding. I eliminated cokes and sweet tea and cut way back. No paleo yet. So from June 2010 to October 2011

I hit a wall at around 200lbs. I want to be 170 - so I wasn't happy. I found the Daily Apple and order Sisson's book Primal Blueprint 21 days.

This was in October. I did the 30 day challenge sans dairy - and quickly readded dairy - but other than that no wheat, or rice since. 

I've dropped to right at 180lbs now. At the same time

I started with the bar and in these 3 months I've progessed to:

Squats (deep full) - 5x5 - 200lbs
Deads 5x5 200lbs
Reverse rows 140 lbs
Bench press 150 lbs
Push Press 90lbs

When I stared I could not do a single chin up / pull up / or dip.

Now I can do 10 unassisted chin ups / 3 unassisted pullups / and 15 unassisted bodyweight dips.

I also do 100 pushups and 100 air squats on 'off days' lifting

I walk my 2 miles to and from work every day

Per calipers in October

Per calipers today

If anyone is on the fence about this

My pressure is down from around 130/75 in October to 105/60 average now. Also

Anyone visiting the house would assume that they had stepped into a horror movie

[Head in the sink...](http://imgur.com/l6vys)

[Dismembered limbs...](http://imgur.com/1hFcp)

Organs on the counter... 

So

*Jesus. Tap-dancing. Christ.* 

It was the best liver I've ever tasted.

There's a [de-boned pig head](http://imgur.com/Qw22W)

And yet

My regular processor had to retire over the winter due to failing health. I've never used this place before. They came out and did on-farm butchering, and the next moment-- pop!-- he was dead from a .22 slug to the brain.

I asked if they needed anything, half of my beautiful (and expensive to feed) pig was in the waste bin with the guts and the poop.

This was my face: 

**D:**

So I silently freaked out for about five seconds; then got control of myself and politely asked if we could salvage all of the edible organs and other odds and ends

They were not willing to process the head

*They didn't know what trotters were.* Apparently

One of the guys rummaged around in the gut bucket and retrieved the liver and heart. I think the kidneys and oysters are MIA. The skin wasn't salvageable-- the hair had poop all over it from being in with the intestines. I've just this moment realized that I didn't specify anything about the lard

Am I really that out of step?

Do other people seriously feed a hog for between five months and a year (which is DAMNED expensive)

I mean... that animal just gave its *life* so that my family could eat it. And I'm just supposed to let half of it go to the landfill? WTF?

- There is nothing wrong with having more meat 

- Meat and veg is the best kind of dinner anyway why clog it up with carbs

- Fruit is natures candy (shout to Marge Simpson for that)

- If you just put some thought into it this is the most satisfying diet

- In 2 months ive gone from 230 to 212 without feeling like ive been on a diet at all (This loss could of been greater but im back in the gym now and putting muscles weight back on :) )

- BBQ everything if you can (you loose nutrients but it tastes amazing)

- Garlic improves EVERYTHING 

- Bacon. Nothing needs to be said about this. 

Im now want to get stricter with my diet

Thank you Paleo... you're awesome.

- Most important; my depression is so reduced I'm fucking amazed... I would've never guess a diet could make your mood that much better! I noticed my mood got better by upping my fat intake

- More energy, less tired! This is pretty intersting, because I just realized when writing this, that my memeory has also gotten better (altough I'm just 21). I used to forget everything before, like sometimes I would put my keys some place and forget where I put them a second after. Anything similar like that hasn't happened once on this diet.

- Now the naps I sometimes take in the middle of the day are pleasant

- I have rosacea, especially on my nose- and eyebrow-area. Not anymore though. :)

- Can go much longer without feeling the need to eat

- This is kinda stupid

Also

How much of my calories should come from fat and how much from proteins? I'm especially interested in how much fat I can eat at maximum (if there really is a limit as long as you don't eat so much you get fat?).

And also, easy to get enough calories, and in my case pretty low carb (around 40g a day). My question is, would I benefit from eating more carbs? And in that case, what are the best paleo carb sources?",,False,t5_2qzzs,True

In these 8 weeks

Well

Here are a couple of things I'm cooking these days. Please bare in mind that I'm a beginner. I am never sure which piece of meat I'm cooking. Feel free to comment and tell me if I break any Paleo rule

(when oil is mentioned

1) Beef + Asparagus:

(takes 15 minutes to prepare)

- [photo 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7760662268/in/photostream)
- [photo 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7760670650/in/photostream)
- in a plate, pepper and garlic (no salt)
- in the over for &lt; 10 minutes (200¬∞c)
- in the meantime
- take the asparagus out

2) Slow roasted Tomatoes (this seriously delicious):

(takes 3 minutes to prepare

Perfect for salads. You can save that for weeks (in oil).

- [photo 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748796054/in/set-72157630991756204)
- cut 3 or 4 tomatoes in small slices
- add unpeeled segments of garlic
- oil
- in the over for 1 or 2 hours (less then 100¬∞c)
- take it out. ""press"" the garlic to remove the skin

3) Stew beef + mushrooms

- [photo 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748792654/in/set-72157630991756204)
- Cook quickly the beef in a pan to give it some color (add some fat)
- add onions
- put everything in a dish
- the beef will melt in your mouth :)

4) Mint beef:

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748843778/in/set-72157630991756204)

5) Peach pork:

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748857048/in/set-72157630991756204)

6) Pork stuffed with zucchinis

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748838382/in/set-72157630991756204)
- open a pork tenderloin (cut one centimeter inside
- once open, add slices of zucchinis
- wrap with aluminum foil
- in the oven (~200c)

7) Broccoli

- In a pan
- take the pork out

I love me some meat, which is not what is supposed to happen. If I ate more fat/calories, even with carbs under 20g, I gained weight.

So, maple syrup, and sweet potatoes. I missed going to the local farms here in upstate NY, and buying honey on the comb, or their fresh veggies and wonderful fruits. I know veggies are allowed on keto, but I'd eat so little every day because of the high carb content of some, that most of it would go bad. I understand that keto is wonderful and is such an awesome lifestyle for many people, because it actually seems a lot LESS restrictive

It's easy for me to cut out wheat/breads, because I've already been doing that for over a year. I probably won't cut out greek yogurt/cheese, or peanut butter as I've never felt any ill affects from them (I cut them out for a while, and added them back in, and felt the same)

I feel like I've been lied to my whole life.  I'm 30 years old, low-fat diets, and never lost weight.  I mocked the Atkins people (c'mon, *of course* you need carbs), tracked my calories, and bought everything I could find, ""fat free""

The more facts I uncover, or how cholesterol itself doesn't cause heart disease, or that eating fat doesn't make you fat.  Instead, I learn about how the USDA had an assistant secretary fishing for a scientist that would sign off on a carb-heavy food pyramid, and how the McGovern commission recommended all Americans reduce saturated fat, because McGovern was on a low-fat diet, and decided to ignore the advice of the scientists on the commission

Is anyone else angry at how the American people have essentially been engineered to be overweight, I'm already a libertarian, but this whole food fiasco has made me surer than ever that government is not an entity to be trusted.

- Sex: Male
- Age: 33
- Height: 6'0""
- Weight: 175 lbs. 
- Body fat %: ~15%

I started eating a paleo diet on December 26th, the doc recommended a low-cholesterol diet.  However, the whole reason I had the tests performed was so I could see exactly how paleo eating affected my lipid levels.  A low cholesterol diet it is not!

So

Today was my 6 month followup.  Here's how it came out:

- Total Cholesterol: 207
- Triglycerides: 64  (this was over 200 3 years ago!)
- HDL: 52 
- Cholesterol/HDL: 4.0
- LDL (Friedewald formula): 142
- LDL/HDL: 2.7
- VLDL: 13

If I calculate my LDL using the Iranian formula

The doc said normally he would be concerned about the LDL and recommend starting medication, I can keep eating bacon and eggs for breakfast every day.

Thank you

Hello!

I am working on a Paleo/dietary restrictions app idea and wanted to get some initial feedback. My idea essentially is a restaurant meal planner based on dietary restrictions.

Here's a sample userflow:

1. You are Paleo and have dairy/soy restrictions. You want to go out to eat tonight with some friends in San Francisco, you must first find out if they serve food that meet your dietary needs.

2. You enter in the app your location (San Francisco)

3. The app crunches your criteria and brings up a list of Indian restaurants in San Francisco that serve menu items that are Paleo and adhere to dairy/soy restrictions.

4. You scroll through the list of restaurants and tap on the one you want to browse.

5. The app then shows you the exact menu items in that Indian restaurant that are Paleo and dairy/soy free. 

6. Now you know the restaurant can serve your dietary needs and what exactly to order before you even get there.

I am on Paleo and this is a problem I often struggle with whenever I go out to eat with friends. Since it is a lifestyle choice (and not a medical need like peanut allergies), but there's often not as much information on Yelp pages for me to discern if something is Paleo or has other dietary restrictions.

So my question to all of you is:

1. **Would you use the app above

(Just to clarify -- this would ideally cover criteria of vegetarian/vegan/Paleo/gluten free as well as food allergies

2. **What are your typical habits or ways of finding out if a restaurant is Paleo friendly or not? Yelp? Word of mouth? Online communities?**

3. **What other problems are you facing when eating out? What kind of things would you love to see that would solve those problems?**

If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area
