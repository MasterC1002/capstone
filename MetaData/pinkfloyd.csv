While studying last year

Yesterday at work, Atom Heart Mother. I love Echoes, Shine on You Crazy Diamond, and all of Animals (anything over 20 mins. is awesome), so the opening suite of Atom Heart Mother actually killed me. 

As the song opened, as this is unlike any Floyd (or music) I've heard before. Then the beautiful, flowing bass/violin/keyboard solo, into a wailing guitar solo, followed by the choral section. 

But what slaughtered me was the part starting around 10 minutes. Starting with a typical pink Floyd groove, I was grooving pretty hard, but those voices added an entirely new dimension to it. I envisioned myself groovin and chanting around a huge bonfire with some native americans, decked out in tribal garb. I can't really describe how awesome it was.

Then they close the song out with more awesome orchestral parts, with trains, loudspeakers, and sheep all sounding along the way.

I can't wait to listen to it with my dad.",self,t5_2qhwe,False,,cow,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/1gqha1/my_life_changed_yesterday/
