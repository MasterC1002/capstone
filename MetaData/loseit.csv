About 2.5 years ago, a PhD student, and full of questions. That was a defining moment in my life process. I had the setback of a severely broken foot that required two surgeries and an extended healing process. Towards the end of the healing process, I heard about a local pool that offered water aerobics and thought it would be a good way to start moving towards exercise without being high impact on my foot. After the first class, I realized that water aerobics just wasn't my style. I decided to return to the pool during open swim to try out laps. I was nervous and rocking a ridiculous leopard print halter top one piece because it was the only swimwear I had. At the beginning, it was all I could do to get one length of the pool (25 yards) completed at a time. And this is where I started. I swam as much as I could each day and loved every minute of it. I have found that swimming is very therapeutic in a lot of ways - physically and mentally. At the same time, I started using the myfitnesspal website and app. I was very careful and obsessive about the calories for a long time. The pounds didn't come off quickly at first and this was very discouraging, the weight loss began to show. I have since found myself able to swim for two hours with minimal stops for goggle adjustments and I have also incorporated land exercises - biking, and just being a genuinely healthy person. The BMI calculator says that I've still got about 25 lbs to go,

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big &amp; Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back


Fortunately it only took about six months, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today


Thank you to Mom, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Margie


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

It's still a work in progress, it is a really bad photo - even for what I used to look like, but the difference is pretty crazy.

Basically I just stopped eating quite so much, counting calories (without depriving myself) and exercise a couple of times a week.

I find this sub-reddit so inspiring and thought that I'd post this in case it did the same for someone else!

Quite a few of you have commented or sent me a message about it inspiring you which is exactly what I hoped to do. 100 pounds ago, it is possible.

I won't bore you with the sob story, got bigger in teenaged years, and then REALLY put on weight in college (like 200 lbs in four years). Anyway, I promised myself that once I finished my Ph. D, I'd get serious about my weight. Once I became ABD, I figured I'd better make good on my promise to my body.

Anyway, I was happy, since I expected it to be over 500. Additionally, my blood work was impeccable: not diabetic, cholesterol was normal, EKG was perfect, and even my blood pressure was dang good for a person of any size

However, it's not pretty, and I'd like to be able to see my niece grow up, maybe even have some kids of my own. With the beginning of the new year, I put my plan into action

The main thing was changing my diet. I downloaded the Myfitnesspal app and started religiously tracking my calories. (Be friends with me! My name on it is ""stutully"") After a couple days of seeing my regular eating habits, like oatmeal or a kale shake. I keep my calorie intake at 2000 calories, and don't allow myself to cheat. Although it might stink passing up a slice of pizza or going out with friends to get wings, my logic is passing up on it now will allow for me to enjoy it for years, if not decades later. 

As for exercise, but after a month or so, I was fine. Additionally, I've begun taking regularly nightly walks that last about 30 minutes or so, a habit I've never had before.

So in almost 5 months, if I can do it, ANYONE can.

Either way

Then my brother &amp; mother started a shake diet called Isagenix.. most of you are probably aware of this.   A protein shake diet that is ridiculously over priced but it was a program that laid it out on the line..   Here's what you eat and drink..  Here is what you don't eat..  Plain and simple..   There was not having to learn anything..   So I signed up and regretted spending money instantly..   I hated that I was doing something the easy way.   But it was too late..   I made the financial commitment and I was going to do the program.. and I was going to do it right..  In the first month I followed the plan religiously..  and lost 28 lbs..

Here's a before and after..   and trust me.. I really hate looking at these so this pains me..

http://i.imgur.com/Z7QGi.jpg

Shortly after the first month, I quit Isagenix and was totally motivated to educate myself and do it properly..   and so I started a Paleo diet..   I'll give Isagenix a bit of a complement here..   Because I had consumed so much liquid and wasn't filling my belly with food all the time.   My stomach shrank..  I could not consume the meals I was eating before.  So this really helped in the months following.

Another 6 weeks after quitting Isagenix and starting Paleo

Here's me shortly after losing 50..  This still pains me cause I hate how I let myself get too far..

Yes, you breathe hard and your efforts at moving forward make you cringe.  

You cling shyly to the furthest corridor

You are awesome. If you’d look me in the eye only for an instant, to face your fears and to bravely set yourself in motion, in front of others.  

You have already begun your transformation. You no longer accept this physical state of numbness and passivity. You have taken a difficult decision, creating room for an improved version, one that is stronger, healthier and forward-looking, one who knows that anything is possible.  

You’re a hero to me. And, the ones that probably make you feel so inadequate, stare in awe at your determination. They, of all people, know best where you are coming from. They heard the resolutions of so many others, who vowed to pick up running and improve their health, “starting next week”. Yet, who digs from deep inside to find the strength to come here

You are a runner, very soon, maybe tomorrow, you’ll step outside and marvel at your capabilities. You will not believe your own body, you will realize that you can do this. And a new horizon will open up for you. You are a true inspiration.  

I bow to you.

I try to check in with myself and make sure I'm hungry before I go for a snack. I drink a lot of water. 

I've flirted with keto, but have found that long-term, a little bit of everything in moderation works for me. Whole natural foods fill me up the best and keep me bouncy, so I tend to gravitate towards them. I like to dance, so any exercise that involves music is sure to appeal to me.

FAQ:

**How old are you?**

23 

**How tall are you?**

5'10''

**What made you decide to do lose the weight?**

I really, Globe, and Anchor. I can't wait!

**What do your work outs consist of?**

The way I lost the first 100 pounds was by doing cardio for at least an hour a day. Cardio Cardio Cardio. I used the elliptical machine the most. Now I run 3 to 5 miles a day and still do the elliptical machine for 30 minutes afterwards. I'm also weight training

**What's your diet like?**

I'm trying to lose another 5 to 10 pounds at the moment so I'm eating very little. Whey Protein after my work out in the morning, another bowl of cereal for dinner. I'm probably on a 1500 calorie daily deficit. I know, I know. That's insane. I wouldn't recommend anyone do this unless you know your body can take it and you have the mental toughness to go hungry from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep. Do I have cheat meals once a week to keep me sane? Absolutely! I usually make myself a cheeseburger or 2 at home on Saturdays.

**Best advise I can give someone about losing weight?**

Don't quit. Don't you ever quit. You only fail if you quit and give up. As long as you don't quit

Look

This wasn't my first attempt at losing weight. I had been trying to lose weight since I was 14 after being overweight for as long as I could remember. What was different this time than all those other attempts? I didn't quit after things got hard or made mistakes on my diet. I kept on going. That's what made the difference.

Four years ago, she seemed to be a genuine good person. When I saw her I realized that a fat slob like I was would never be able to be with such a beautiful woman. That's the day it all changed. 


I was 370 pounds

One of my friend is a personal trainer and he was more than happy to help me get started


That same friend had me meet one of his friend who helped me on the food front. What to eat, just less but it was more on the healthy side. I was allowed a cheat day, the day I didn't go to the gym, because let's be honest... if I was that fat it's because I fucking enjoy eating right? Can't take everything away all at once! I stopped doing the cheat day maybe a year in because I couldn't get myself to eat such nasty shit anymore, it didn't taste as good as most of the healthy stuff anyway.


Two years later, fit, I went to the same restaurant after dinner service to see if she was still working there to tell her how she changed my life. She was. I told her I needed to talk to her once she was done. I waited outside for roughly 30 mins when she came out.


I explained her everything and how she changed my life. She started crying and said nobody ever said something like that to her and she gave me the longest hug.

**Comprehensive Fat Loss Guide**

Stay with me here

**Understand Hormone Signaling to Understand Why You’re Packing on the Fat**

* **Insulin** – Insulin is a hormone. It signals to your body that glucose needs to be stored. Insulin is released in response to glucose entering the blood stream. ALL carbohydrates(sugar, and simple) are broken down into glucose. Your body releases insulin in direct proportion to the volume of glucose in your blood. Glucose needs to be either burned as fuel, stored in the liver and muscles, or stored as fat. High levels of glucose in the bloodstream is toxic to the body.

&gt;Insulin stops the use of fat as an energy source by inhibiting the release of glucagon. With the exception of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome

Low-carb diets like the ketogenic diet are the gold-standard for losing fat. Low-carb diets by definition limit the amount of glucose entering your bloodstream thereby eliminate blood sugar(glucose) spikes. This mediation of blood glucose then eliminates large insulin spikes.

With our new understanding of insulin it is easy to see why the average person eating a standard Western diet has weight issues. Most of their meals consist at least 100g of fast-digesting carbohydrates made up of breads, burger buns, sandwiches(subway is a terrible choice for weight loss), pasta sides, sugary cereal, and sugary soft-drinks.


These processed carbohydrates are easier for our digestive system to break down and thus introduce glucose into our bloodstream faster and at higher volumes than carbohydrate rich vegetables and fruits. It requires nine cups of strawberries to equal the sugar content of one 20 oz soda. As we learned earlier

The problem for most Westerners is that their carbohydrate consumption is completely out of balance with their physical activity level. I am a very active man and I only need an average of 150g of carbohydrates per day to keep my muscle and liver glycogen levels full. The average westerner consumes on average 300g of carbohydrates per day. And they don’t exercise. With every meal they are storing glucose as fat. With every meal they are releasing a hormone into their body that inhibits their body’s ability to use fat as energy. And then you get to listen to them whine about how hard it is to lose weight.

Type 2 Diabetes is a direct result of our standard Western diet’s effect on insulin.

&gt;When you have type 2 diabetes, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy. – PubMed

If you have eaten a high carbohydrate diet for all of your life it is likely that you are insulin resistant to some degree. Insulin resistance causes lethargy

The final piece of the insulin puzzle are its effects on your hunger and energy levels. Think “sugar crash.” You eat something high in sugar, muscles, and fat cells. Insulin is so efficient infact that large insulin responses will leave you with too-little glucose in your bloodstream. This then signals to your body that you need immediate energy and you will feel sharp cravings for more high carbohydrate foods. A vicious cycle.

* **Leptin** – Leptin a hormone that tells your body that you are full. It counteracts other hormones which tell your body to feed. Leptin is released in large quantities when you eat fats and proteins and in lesser quantities when you eat carbohydrates.

&gt;Leptin acts on receptors in the hypothalamus of the brain

&gt; * counteracting the effects of neuropeptide Y (a potent feeding 

&gt; * stimulant secreted by cells in the gut and in the hypothalamus)

&gt; * counteracting the effects of anandamide (another potent feeding stimulant that binds to the same receptors as THC)

&gt; * promoting the synthesis of α-MSH

Fats and proteins cause significantly more leptin to be released than carbohydrates. Just think about a typical standard breakfast. You can eat pancakes all day. But how many plates of bacon and sausage could you eat before you started to feel sick?

The added satiety afforded by fats and proteins because of leptin is an essential weapon in your war against fat. You can “diet” without feeling starved all day. You can shed fat effortlessly while eating your favorite foods- like bacon!

When we don’t have blood sugar crashes that are caused by insulin spikes we won’t crave sugars and carbohydrates. When we eat meals that are high in fat and protein we stay satiated all day.

* **Cortisol** – Cortisol is a hormone that tells your body to release energy(stored in fat cells). Cortisol is naturally highest in the morning

Cortisol is very beneficial when it is in balance. However, can wreak havoc in your body. Elevated levels of cortisol actually leads to weight gain and a resistance to fat-loss(especially visceral and belly fat).

If you have a layer of belly fat that you just can’t seem to lose no matter what you try then it is almost certain that you have chronically elevated cortisol.

&gt; Sustained high cortisol levels are dangerous because they:

&gt; * Slow down healing and normal cell regeneration.
&gt; * Co-opt parent molecules needed to make other vital hormones
&gt; * Impair digestion
&gt; * Interfere with healthy endocrine function
&gt; * Weaken your immune system – Source

Cortisol also counteracts the effects of insulin and conversely insulin counteracts the effects of cortisol. Therefore we want to minimize our insulin levels in the morning to take full advantage of the enhanced fat metabolism caused by our naturally high cortisol levels.

When we eat we want our cortisol to be at a low point so our bodies can efficiently store our nutrients in our muscles(because some insulin is good

So then it makes sense to eat our big meals later in the day when our cortisol have dropped off naturally. In following this regime we take advantage of the high fat burning power of cortisol in the mornings and let our bodies repair and replenish in the afternoon/evenings.

* **HGH** – HGH or human growth hormone is vital to the repair of our bodies. Studies show that fasting greatly enhances our body’s natural production of HGH.

&gt; “Fasting causes hunger or stress. In response, instead of glucose. This decreases the number of fat cells in the body,” says Dr. Horne. “This is important because the fewer fat cells a body has, the less likely it will experience insulin resistance, or diabetes.”

&gt; This recent study also confirmed earlier findings about the effects of fasting on human growth hormone (HGH), HGH increased an average of 1,300 percent in women, and nearly 2,000 percent in men. - ScienceDaily

Increasing our body’s natural output of growth hormone will help you shed fat AND gain muscle. You’ll even wake up feeling more refreshed after a night’s sleep.

A side-note about growth hormone and alcohol: Never go to bed with alcohol in your system. Alcohol deprives your body of the restorative properties of HGH. Alcohol can decrease the secretion of HGH during sleep by as much as 70%.

**To Recap the Hormones**

* Insulin – Released when you eat carbohydrates. Too much insulin causes fat gain.
* Leptin – Tells your brain that you’re full. Proteins and fats release more leptin than carbohydrates.
* Cortisol – Your body’s “stress hormone.” Naturally highest in the morning. Excessive cortisol causes metabolic problems and stubborn belly and visceral fat.
* HGH – Repairs the body. Fasting causes increased HGH production. Alcohol inhibits HGH production.

**Now We Understand the Science but How do we Take Advantage of it?**

* **Intermittent Fasting** - Popularized by Martin Berkhan on his website www.leangains.com. Martin has a very clear and concise guide written here. I will cover only the main points in this post.

The main idea is that by fasting for 12 to 16 hours a day we create beneficial hormonal changes within our body(remember that fasting for 24 hours caused a rise in growth hormone of 2

&gt; Insulin resistance is currently a major health problem. This may be because of a marked decrease in daily physical activity during recent decades combined with constant food abundance. This lifestyle collides with our genome,000 BC) by criteria that favored survival in an environment characterized by fluctuations between periods of feast and famine. The theory of thrifty genes states that these fluctuations are required for optimal metabolic function. We mimicked the fluctuations in eight healthy young men [25.0 ± 0.1 yr (mean ± SE); body mass index: 25.7 ± 0.4 kg/m2] by subjecting them to intermittent fasting every second day for 20 h for 15 days. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (40 mU·min−1·m−2) clamps were performed before and after the intervention period. Subjects maintained body weight (86.4 ± 2.3 kg; coefficient of variation: 0.8 ± 0.1%). Plasma free fatty acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were 347 ± 18 and 0.06 ± 0.02 mM, respectively, after overnight fast but increased (P &lt; 0.05) to 423 ± 86 and 0.10 ± 0.04 mM after 20-h fasting, confirming that the subjects were fasting. Insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake rates increased from 6.3 ± 0.6 to 7.3 ± 0.3 mg·kg−1·min−1 (P = 0.03), and insulin-induced inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis was more prominent after than before the intervention (P = 0.05). After the 20-h fasting periods, plasma adiponectin was increased compared with the basal levels before and after the intervention (5,860 ± 784 ng/ml

To put all that science talk in simple terms: fasting reduces insulin resistance. This is good.

Intermittent fasting is much easier to follow psychologically than other calorie restricting diets. Eating six small-meals consisting of 400 calories each will leave you feeling unsatiated and craving more . Compare the small frequent meals to the psychological effect of taking a post workout shake of 400 calories and then eating a meal that consists of 2

It is also difficult to overeat when in a 4-8 hour feeding period- especially if those meals are high in fat and protein. Meals high in fat and protein will cause large quantities of leptin to be released and thus leave you feeling full and satisfied.  IF really is a “diet” protocol where you can reach your body composition goals by eating massive and satisfying meals.

When you are following an intermittent fasting protocol the best time to eat is after your workout. Remember that our body will prioritize glucose for the liver and muscles before the glucose is stored as fat. Therefore by eating your carbohydrate dense meals after your workouts the glucose you consume will first be prioritized by the body to repair and replenish your muscles.

It is best to break your fast past noon. This lets your body take advantage of the natural rise in cortisol in the morning which will allow you to mobilize fat for energy. Working out in this fasted state promotes high fat loss. It takes a few weeks to get used to working out in a fasted state but you will experience no detrimental effects on performance once you do get used to working out in a fasted state.

**My schedule:**

* 0500 – Wakeup
* 0530 – Cup of green tea – With no honey
* 1600 – Fasted workout – I sometimes snack on almonds and small pieces of fruit during the day
* 1730 – Post Workout shake – 700 to 1000 calories, 20% carbohydrates from fruit
* 1930 – Meal – 1500-2000 calories, and 10-30% carbohydrates.
* 2300 – Bed – Arnold says we only need six hours of sleep. Listen to Arnold.

**Nutritional Strategies to Maximize Fat Loss**

We’ve talked about how the foods you eat effect your hormones and when the optimal time for eating is. In this section we’ll cover different nutritional strategies that can help you achieve maximal fat loss.

* **The Ketogenic Diet**

If your goal is to lose as much fat as quickly as you can then The Ketogenic Diet is your answer.

&gt; The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain function. However, if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acid sand ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures.[1]

The keto diet is perfectly safe for those without epilepsy. When your caloric intake is less than your expenditure on  a “normal” diet- one which is balanced in fats, 40% protein, 20% fats) your body goes into a state of gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is a process where your liver converts proteins into glucose. If you are cutting on a “normal, balanced” diet your body will actively convert your precious muscle tissue into glucose in order to fuel the body’s vital functions. This is bad.

When you follow the ketogenic diet your macro breakdown looks like this: 55-65% fat

This is exactly what we’re going for. Now instead of burning our precious muscle tissue our body directly burns our fat stores when we eat a caloric deficit.

I’ve cut with every diet out there. For me I lost 50% muscle and 50% fat when cutting on a traditional 40/40/20 diet. My strength in the gym dropped 5% each month. When I switched over to a keto diet my strength actually increased week over week and my weight loss was almost 100% fat. Not only did I preserve muscle

**Where your calories should come from:**

* Fat – Avocados, fish, grass-fed animals, almonds, macadamia nuts, almond butter, coconut butter, free-range eggs. Avoid - Too much farm-raised animal fat, coconut oil, pro-inflammatory fat) in a 1:1 ratio.
* Protein – Grass-fed beef, almonds, and macadamia nuts. Whey protein powder is great for supplementing your protein intake. 30-40% of your calories should come from protein on the ketogenic diet.
* Carbohydrates – Avoid six days a week. Refeed on Sundays. Refeed days should consist of 1.5g of carbohydrates per pound of body weight. If you weigh 200lbs you will eat 300g of carbohydrates on your refeed day. Get your carbohydrates from fruits and veggies – bananas, strawberries, sweet potatoes, potatoes, plantains, yucca root, are a few options. Avoid processed carbohydrates(breads, flours). Your goal is to avoid eating ANY carbohydrates Monday through Saturday.

**Benefits of Keto:**

* When your body has no fuel from food it burns stored bodyfat instead of converting protein into glucose.
* The most effective fat burning diet in existence.
* You can eat awesome and satisfying meals- like bacon-wrapped steaks! On keto you can eat until you’re full and still lose 2-3 pounds of fat per month.
* Maintains muscle mass on a cut better than traditional 40/40/20 diets
* Keto increases your body’s insulin sensitivity and gives you steady energy levels throughout the day because you avoid insulin induced blood sugar crashes.

**Negatives of Keto:**

* It can be difficult to avoid all carbs and stay in ketosis. 
* You are missing out on vital nutrients by avoiding fruits and vegetables. You should always supplement with a high quality multivitamin but this is especially important while on keto. [Link to my favorite cost-effective multi.](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/nowadam)
* Your gym performance will suffer because your muscles will be glycogen depleted. This will lead to lower strength and endurance in your workouts. However this is temporary. As soon as you refill your muscle glycogen your performance comes back. Thus you should do your heavy lifting on Mondays after your carb refeeds.

**Carb Cycling**

Carb cycling is a nice middle-of-the road approach for people who want to lose fat but don’t want their gym performance to suffer. Depending on the amounts of carbs and calories you take in carb cycling is a very effective recomp eating strategy. Recomp is when you lose fat and gain muscle at the same time(albeit not as much fat as you could lose on a purely cutting diet

The idea behind carb cycling is that we want our muscle glycogen stores to be full when we perform our maximal effort lifts. We also want to keep our insulin as low as possible during the week in order to mobilize the greatest amount of fat and avoid all of the aforementioned problems that can come with excess insulin. We can achieve this by timing our carbohydrate intake.

When you carb cycle you should pick three days a week where you want to have the best performance in the gym. When I carb cycle I follow a 5×5 program and do full-body lifts Monday

* Sunday – Perform 10 minutes of HIIT. This can be sprints, plantains, and sweet potatoes for my carb sources. You perform HIIT prior to eating the carbs because the exercise will ensure that the glucose you consume is shuttled to muscle glycogen stores and not stored as fat.
* Monday – Full-body heavy lifting session in the gym. 15 minutes of HIIT after the session. Eat less than 50g of carbs post workout and no other carbs for the day.
* Tuesday – 10 minutes of HIIT followed by 100g of carbs with another 50g in a follow up meal.
* Wednesday – Full-body heavy lifting session in the gym with 10 minutes of HIIT after the session. Less than 50g of carbs post workout.
* Thursday – 10 minutes of HIIT followed by 100g of carbs with another 50g in a follow up meal.
* Friday – Full-body heavy lifting session in the gym with 15-20 minutes of HIIT after the session. Less than 50g of carbs post workout.
* Saturday – Depending on how I feel I will either perform another session of HIIT

This schedule can be modified to fit your lifestyle. The important thing to note is that your carb intake should always come after your workout. And you should lower the carb intake on your workout days to less than 10g if you want to achieve maximal fat loss. You will not reach ketosis with carb cycling. Carb cycling is great for keeping your insulin under control while giving you maximum strength and endurance in the gym.

**Where your calories should come from:**

* Fat – Avocados, fish, grass-fed animals, almonds, macadamia nuts, almond butter, coconut butter, free-range eggs. Avoid - Too much farm-raised animal fat, coconut oil, pro-inflammatory fat) in a 1:1 ratio.

* Protein – Grass-fed beef, almonds, and macadamia nuts. Whey protein powder is great for supplementing your protein intake. 20-30% of your calories should come from protein on the ketogenic diet.

* Carbohydrates – Get your carbohydrates from fruits and veggies – bananas, strawberries, sweet potatoes, potatoes, plantains, yucca root, are a few options. Avoid processed carbohydrates(breads, flours). 15-25% of your calories should come from carbohydrates.

**Pros:**

* Your muscles will feel refreshed for your heavy lifting workouts.
* You can still gain strength and muscle while simultaneously losing fat. Or if you’re focusing more on cutting weight you can maintain muscle and strength while cutting a good amount of fat per week(.25-.5% bf per week).
* Easier to stick to than a strict keto or low-carb diet.

**Cons:**

* You won’t lose fat as quickly as a pure cutting diet

**What Sorts of Workouts Should I do?**

Progression. Consistency. Efficiency. These shall be your watchwords.

To know the best workout routine for you, and to be jacked.

**I want to look good naked!**

I wish more people would follow through with this goal. To look good naked you only need to perform three to five interval cardio circuits lasting 15 to 25 minutes each week.

Throw out the old notion that “more is better.”

&gt;SPRINT training for 60 minutes a week burns the same amount of body fat in men as jogging for seven hours a week

High intensity interval circuits(HIIT) are exercises where you bring your heart rate above 85% of your maximal rate for 30-90 seconds and then rest for 30-60 seconds before performing another set. These circuits have several benefits for those wanting to look good naked:

* HIIT promotes optimal hormone signaling – causing your body to release more testosterone and growth hormone.
* HIIT increases insulin sensitivity.
* HIIT burns calories at a much higher rate than traditional “steady-state” cardio. The study linked above shows that performing four sprint workouts for 15 minutes each burns as much visceral fat in men as those who ran for six to seven hours at a steady pace.
* HIIT promotes much greater muscular hypertrophy than steady-state cardio- you’ll gain more muscle

There is really no reason for you to do steady-state cardio unless you’re training for a specific endurance event. Even if you are an endurance athlete HIIT workouts combined with long-distance endurance workouts create the optimal endurance athlete.

Steady-state cardio also has drawbacks that you won’t see with HIIT:

* Long periods of steady-state training promotes high levels of cortisol in the body- this leads to muscle catabolism
* Steady-state training depletes glucose stores – leaving you hungry and craving sugar
* TIME. Why spend seven hours working out each week when you can get BETTER results in only one hour?

**My recommended workout regime for someone who wants to look good naked:**

* Two full-body strength training workouts in the gym each week- focusing on heavy compound lifts: squat, pullups, rows, dips, military press. These workouts should be short and intense. Work in the 4-6 rep range for 3-6 working sets(warmups don’t count as a working set) per exercise and finish your workout in 45 minutes or less.
* Two to four HIIT training sessions per week. A simple HIIT workout is to sprint for 30 seconds
* Perform two HIIT sessions per week on days that you aren’t lifting. Keep it short and simple. 25 minutes max.
* Don’t perform a HIIT session the day before a lifting session.
* Each HIIT session should all be less than 15 minutes long if you perform more than two HIIT sessions per week.

**The key is progression in the gym. You can add progression by decreasing your rest times, cry, or die.**

**I just want to be healthy**

You don't need a sixpack. You don't need 18"" biceps. You just want to feel good and have life-long health.

Many of the same concepts that apply to those who want to look good naked still apply to you. You will still benefit greatly from HIIT workouts. You won't need any gym-based strength training workouts(unless you want to hit the gym). And you can get away with 1-2 hours of total exercise per week and still reach your goals.

&gt; “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” ― Hippocrates

Nutrition, processed carbohydrates, and toxic chemicals. There are people living today whose only form of exercise is a leisurely walk in the morning- yet they are more healthy and more vital than many ""gym rats"" who kill themselves with hours of intense exercise. Because the former eat a nourishing and revitalizing diet while the latter punish their bodies with processed poison.

I'm going to assume that you have no desire to perform intense exercise. If you don't mind doing some sprints and hitting the gym you'll be better served by following the ""I want to look good naked"" advice. As someone who has a relatively lower level of physical activity you will need to limit your carbohydrate intake. Remember that any excess glucose that can't be stored in the liver or muscles is stored as fat. Since you have a low activity level your liver and muscle glycogen levels will remain full throughout the week- thus your dietary carbohydrate intake must be consciously reduced. The reason more than one third of Americans are obese is because they live a sedentary lifestyle yet consume more carbohydrates than even a triathlete can use. What a crazy world.

**Your workout:**

* Walk for at least half an hour four times a week. If you can walk for half an hour every-day
* Incorporating bodyweight exercises is still recommended. You won't need to ramp up the intensity but three sets of pushups, and squats two times a week will build a base of strength that will keep you strong and limber as you age. These also promote beneficial hormone releases in the form of testosterone and growth hormone, both of which help slow the aging process and keep you vital.
* There is absolutely nothing wrong with strength training or HIIT circuits for your healthy life goals. I recommend them to everyone. But you don't need to do them if your goal is to simply lose weight and be healthy.

**I want to be JACKED**

Strength training in the gym is the most efficient way to ""get jacked."" Bodyweight exercises are great and can give you a fantastic base of muscle

Imagine that your max pushups is 50 without stopping. To increase the stress load on your muscles in future workouts you must either- do more than 50 pushups without stopping

This problem is very easily solved with barbell weights. Once you've progressed with a certain weight just throw on five more pounds and you have progressed.

Cardio should not be avoided on your quest to get huge. Cardio is too often demonized by the lifting community as being harmful to your gains. Uninformed individuals throw around the idea that cardio will burn your precious muscle. False. With proper nutrition cardio(and especially high intensity interval cardio) works synergistically with your strength-training workouts to promote the most muscle growth while keeping your fat gain to a minimum.

**Your workout routine:**

* I recommend beginners and intermediate lifters follow 5x5. If you're an advanced lifter you don't need me to tell you what to do
* Supplement your lifts with two to three high intensity circuit cardio workouts each week. The circuits should focus on hypertrophy of muscle groups as well as pure cardio. I really like incorporating sets of pullups, biceps, chest, triceps, shoulders, glutes, hams
* Remember
* Pace yourself. Rest. Relax. The gym will still be there tomorrow. You really will make more gains if you take a moderate approach to the gym. Please take this advice if you take nothing else from this post.

I have been asked again and again
All of you know as well as I do

I learned about portion sizes. I counted calories (consumed less than i used ). I exercised and

I used My Fitness Pal religiously. I have logged every day since August 12th with no exceptions. I am going to keep logging for a while so I can really get an idea of how to maintain. I think my actual goal is 145 lbs

Exercise was difficult at first. I really wanted to jump right into the deep end. I wanted to run a 5K and hike mountains. But
About a month in I would walk faster
another month or two
I am happy to say my 5k time is about 27mins now! And last week I kayaked 10 miles! I honestly love exercise now. It never feels like a chore. It is what I wanted to do! 

My background is probably a little different than other people here.  I haven't always been big. In high school I was varsity cross country. But in college I started getting sick. I had headaches all the time. I got physically ill more and more often. I also started having seizures. The doctor's put me on epilepsy meds and I was passed from doctor to doctor for 10 years. Meanwhile
In October of 2011 I landed myself in the hospital with a high fever

Celiac's is a pretty easy fix. No gluten. At all. Ever. I can barely walk into a bakery.

After being completely gluten free for a year and a half I felt well enough to care about myself again. In August of last year I went to my high school reunion. For my name tag I had to wear my senior year photo. Wearing a badge of myself 10 years younger and 100 lbs lighter was a reality punch in the face.

I am happy to say I am healthier than I have ever been. I still face a lot of complications from Celiac going untreated for as long as it did



Quick tips that really helped me:

* keep a water bottle with you. I have a 24 oz water bottle with me all the time at work. It makes sure you stay hydrated. 


*make your own food. you have control over what you are eating.


*stay away from prepackaged food. Your goal is to get healthy


*take a walk. take the stairs. park in the last row. move as much as you can.


Thank you so much r/loseit. You are all an inspiration.

It might be hard for you to see, I find my satisfaction in bettering myself as a human being, not making others feel like less of one.  Your hateful words, while they hurt at first, gave me more motivation to run an additional half mile today, which allowed me to run 1.5 miles non-stop - something that I have never done.

EDIT: I guess my post needs more detail so here's the comment:

It's been a wild ride so far! I was a [fat kid](http://i.imgur.com/nJfeP.jpg) (that's me on the right), gained weight and was happy and healthy by age 18. Then a myriad of social, academic, and medical issues caused me to start seeking solace in too much alcohol and even more food. I gained a shit ton of weight, became severely depressed, lost all interest in everything and felt awful all the time.

Then one day something clicked and it seems silly to say but I owe it all to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NFWgG4_6NI). I was just mesmerized by the way that girl moves and how lithe her body is. I watched 20 seconds of that video, I'm gonna have it! As for exercise, I do Zumba and yoga, I love hula-hooping and I recently found a belly-dancing sarong I bought in Taiwan a few years back so I'd love to get into that! Also, I used to throw myself into either starving myself or gorging myself to deal with stress: now I throw myself into working out!

I started looking at /r/loseit back in August for inspiration. I remember looking at everyone's progress pictures and wishing I could just fast-forward through the hard part and be looking at my own progress pictures. Well, none of us would feel half as proud of ourselves as we are.

* GOOD FOR YOU BUDDY. You are increasing your quality of life in the ways that cannot be quantified. You are no longer indifferent to your health
* Damn

It's totally normal to feel more sensitive to people judging you in a new environment. I imagine it must be even more acute if you've frequently suffered people making derogatory comments about your appearance.

But think about it. The gym is the one place where you are *immune* from such comments. ""Hey fatty, old, black, white, obese, skinny - everyone's there for one reason only: to get healthier.

You want to lose weight, right? So what about the times when you're at the supermarket, loading your stuff onto the belt? What about the times when you get into work and get a coffee and a chocolate muffin on the way to your desk?

You think the people watching your sorry ass standing next to that mountain of shitty food at the cash register aren't judging you? You think your colleagues watching you eat cake for breakfast every morning aren't judging you? And yet you're worried what people might think about you in the *gym*?

People are always forming passing judgements on other people - both positive and negative ones. I'm not necessarily endorsing it

The gym is your personal oasis away from all the crappy judgements you have ever endured

Why aren't you there?

(**Edit**: several people have mentioned comments from those who clearly do care about someone's appearance in the gym, per the title, like telling a sick person that they don't belong in hospital, and you should treat such comments with the respect they deserve: none whatsoever. Furthermore, whatever gym equipment you have paid to use, you have EVERY RIGHT to use it as other paid members. If they have a problem with that, its their problem, but it's not going to amount to anything if you still give a fuck about what other people think of you.)",t5_2rz8w,True

* With over 25lbs gone, calorie deficits, diets, body hacks… the works (I basically became a physical trainer over night haha). 

* I designed a plan based around High-protein, and gave me all the fuel I needed.
* I kept my intake around 1800kcals and cycled in carbs every few days so that I had the energy to workout. I ate 6 meals a day
* As I couldn't afford gyms, the works!).

Last night my wife came into my office and told me that she was tired of me being cranky lately about being plateaued in my weight loss.  It's been a few weeks since I've seen any weight loss

I did and she handed me a pair of jeans. She told me to put them on without opening my eyes.  I started laughing and asked if she was serious.  She just said ""Keep 'em closed and get changing.""

So trying not to fall over I finally got them on and buttoned up without opening my eyes.  It's actually harder than it seems.  The pants fit well

Finally she took my left hand in hers and told me to open my eyes. I did and looked down at what I was now wearing.  The black shirt and new jeans looked good on me

She looked me in the eye and told me ""When you told me you were going to lose weight you were wearing a 3XL or 4XL shirts.  Your suit pants are a 50 waist and your jeans were 48's.  Right now you're wearing a 2XL shirt and a pair of 42 waist jeans.  You're freaking out about the scale without recognizing what your accomplishments are.  You gotta stop that honey.  Okay?""

I'll admit I suddenly felt all kinds of embarassed and awkward so I just nodded.  She smiled and gave me a kiss before telling me to get back to my game. When she was about four steps down the hall she stopped and looked back at me over her shoulder.  She called back

Damn I love that woman.

I'm 5'10.

Each picture has a description which will answer some of the questions people may have.

The basics: The first part of my loss came from life changes and just putting my foot down. My initial 30 pound loss came from cutting down what I ate. At the time

The second big amount of loss came from moving to Vancouver. My main mode of transportation was walking, because I was bored, etc. I looked for any excuse. By then I had lost another 67 pounds.

Another life change caused me to move back home and I gained 40 of the 67 I had lost back, but this was my first time wanting to do it. I made my 2011 Resolution to get down to 250, which was a few pounds less than what I was when I began to gain again.

I started January 1st. My main exercise was a stationary bike, I lost just over 102 pounds for the year, far exceeding my resolution.

I had intended to just do it until I hit my resolution, you have to choose an exercise that you like doing; something that you can do for the rest of your life. If you go in thinking, ""I'll just do this until I lose the weight,"" you'll relapse for sure. I finished my 2011 resolution four months in and said screw it, and decided to go for the rest of the year. I realized then, that it's not something you can start and stop. It's a lifestyle change, and if you're not in it for life



Because of Holiday eating, let alone exercising again. I'm finally feeling up to going at it again, with yesterday being the first time I'd done anything in a long while.

I weighed in at 347 lbs (I am 6'3"") on 2/18/2010 after avoiding a scale for over a year. I was 20 years old and had allowed myself to become

Now

The same day I weighed in at 347 I began my diet and exercise regiment. I cut out all fast food, what I now realize, FAR too strict of a diet. I was only eating only about 1400-1600 calories a day. I kept on riding the exercise bike before and after work for 5-7 minutes (which was as long as I could last) until I eventually was riding it for 20 minutes a session before and after work. Once the bicycling seemed ""too easy"" I began walking to and from work (1.5 miles each way) and riding the exercise bike in the evening. Then I moved down to San Diego away from home. By the time I had moved I had already lost 80 lbs and was down to ~270. Once I was in SD I began using the elliptical machines for cardio at the 24 hour fitness I went to in Point Loma. I would do 30 minutes a day along with my weight lifting, which I did 5-6 days a week. Once I dropped down to 240 lbs I began to run on the treadmill. I had weighed 240 through most of high school and played football at that weight so I told myself If I could run at 240 in high school I could do it now. I kept on using running as my main means of cardio ever since. I had never once passed ""the mile"" test in high school (I believe the cut off point was 16 minutes) I fell in love with running. I only assume that I enjoyed it so much because, unlike weight lifting, I had previously never been able to do it very well. 

The lowest I dropped down to was 193 lbs but I looked like a skeleton and began a 2 month ""phase"" in which I ate at maintenance (~3200 calories a day) and I tried to let my body adjust to living at that weight. After my ""adjustment phase"" I upped my calorie intake to 4000 calories a day and cut my cardio back to twice a week runs for my first attempt at a bulking phase. I have to say, god, I was a wreck mentally. I constantly felt bloated and ""fat"" but I guess those are just the hang ups I will have to continue to work through. I have since ""cut"" back down from 215 (what I weighed after my first attempt at a bulk) and now my diet now has me consuming around 3000 calories a day to ""maintain"" my weight.

A few ""key"" things I have learned over the past 2 years:
- Count calories. Do it
- Diet should be your main focus. Cardio helps to burn extra calories, everyone should weight lift as well (extra burned calories from the act of weight lifting and adding on muscle mass will lead to you naturally burning more calories)
- Personally, medium fat intake on a daily basis. I generally kept my carbs around 150 grams a day and my fats around 100-125 grams a day. Protein intake would be anywhere from 200-300 grams. That is a very general look at it but, it's pretty much what my macro nutrient intake looks like.
- Don't go for any diet that excludes an entire food group. Please

I can easily go into more detail

Edit #2:

The response to this has been overwhelming! I was only expecting a few ""good jobs"". Definitely didn't see myself getting so many upvotes for this!

Here's a quick FAQ on me:



How old am I?

-21


How tall am I?

-5'10''



What did I do to lose all that weight?

-I worked hard. That's really all there is to it. You want something? You gotta work hard to get it. But most importantly, where I would cheat on my diet or even skip the gym because i didn't feel like doing it anymore. But what made the difference is that I picked myself up shortly afterwards and kept on going.



Did I plateau?

-Yes. Many times. And let me tell you, my body just started shedding like 2+ pounds a week.



Do I lift weights?

-Not really. I kinda did at first for the first 3 months or so but I realized that cardio burns way more fat and calories than weight training (this is my opinion. if you don't agree



What cardio machines did you use?

-90% elliptical. 5% treadmill. 5% bicycle.



How often do I go to the gym?

-Everyday. I personally don't believe in rest days.



Did I follow a certain exercise program or diet program?

-No. I kinda just did what felt right. At the gym I did what really got my heart beat going and made me workout the most. As for a diet, etc.



What's the best advise that I can give to someone who is trying to lose a lot of weight?

-Do not give up. No matter what. You miss one day at the gym? Or eat unhealthy one day? pick yourself right back up the next day and punish yourself at the gym the next day. Also, 1 year of hard work = a lifetime of benefits.



When did I start seeing results?

-Within 2 months. They were small

First off, I would like to thank everyone for the support, because I could never have done this without all of the encouragement that I received to keep going.

There have been thousands of people who have done what I have done (as seen on this sub-reddit) and all you ever really hear about his how they dieted and how they exercised and I will happily provide you all with that information in my instance, for anyone it is 90% mental and the 10% pain you feel is only the pain that makes you stronger. Anyways, quote time: “No food tastes as good as being healthy”. Find your motivation.

My Stats:
Starting Weight: 335 (43% BF)
Current Weight 175 (16% BF)
Starting Shirt/Pant Sizes: 3XL/46
Current Shirt/Pant Sizes: S-M/32
Starting Mile Time: 17+ minutes

Current Consecutive Pullups: 10

***I didn’t any lifting to begin with, and Squat 250 (I’m really shooting for the 1000 pound club)***

My Diet:
For the most part I did calorie counting, and they both worked, but for me calories in versus calories out is the easiest thing to do and it worked best with my schedule. Along with that I focused on not eating late, mostly drinking water, hitting my protein goals, managing my sweet tooth, limiting carbs, because I am too poor to eat out

My Exercises:
I stayed pretty consistent for the entire two years with my splits. I would do cardio every day, legs, shoulders and traps, and abs roughly five times a week. I seem to be extremely injury prone so I made adjustments accordingly. 

Supplements:
 Protein (whey and casein), CLA, and BCAAs

What I did wrong:
My progress has been pretty slow; it’s amazing seeing some of you lose 140 pounds in a year and stuff like that. I lost 30 pounds my first month and despite already being weak I had gotten significantly weaker so I decided to bulk and cut at the same time. It is doable, I have gained roughly 20 pounds of muscles (estimate) and once I am done, because I don’t have to bulk just finish burning the fat around what is already there. So, I guess I could weigh less now, but the super skinny look is not what I am going for.

Despite the progress

Anyways

In 2008 I started cutting out a cheeseburger a day and eating breakfast at home (usually oatmeal or cereal) and then after a few months I started eating dinner at home (usually junk food I heat up in the oven), really simple stuff I could cook on the stove or in the microwave. I stopped eating cheeseburgers at lunch and started buying chicken and salads. By 2011 I was 360 pounds, having lost 40 just from changing my food little by little. In 2011 I got a nicer kitchen and started getting into cooking (and I moved in with my family and had people to cook for) and I started cooking whole and organic foods and I stopped buying most processed foods (except pasta and dairy) and I started watching my calories using software and by October 2012 I was 300 pounds. 

Once I got to 300 pounds I started exercising, it would take me about half an hour. Then I started swimming 3 days a week, I started consuming 1200-1400 calories a day, then I increased myself to 15 laps, then 20, and I have lost another 50 pounds since October, and now I swim 5 days a week, and today I hit 250 pounds. I have lost 150 pounds in 5 years, so I am going to get the skin surgeries after I hit goal and maintain it for 6 months.

Let me know if you have any questions, and I can't believe I've finally lost 150 pounds. I've been struggling these last couple of months and my loss slowed down and it feels really good to finally hit that milestone.

ETA: My diabetes is in complete remission and I have been insulin free for 6 months. My PCOS has also improved. I had doctors try to force me to have gastric bypass and I refused

Also

ETA Again: I also wanted to share one more thing that I think is really important. I give myself a guilt-free 10 pound buffer. As long as I stay within 10 pounds of my lowest weight at any given time, it makes things a lot more positive and easier to cope with. And in the last 12 months, I only went over my buffer once (that was after I made a 1300 mile road trip and it was around Christmas).",,False,,t5_2rz8w,,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1gfjf8/as_of_today_i_have_lost_150_pounds_i_am_34_of_the/

I'm also starting to worry about the excess skin that will need to be removed. Originally I planned to lose 330 lbs (530-200), not many things scare me more than surgery, so I'm not looking forward to that. Once I hit 200 post-surgery, I'll decide if that's a good place to stay.

A week ago, as I had a bridesmaid dress I had worn exactly a year ago rotting in my closet. Color me surprised, though, when I put the dress on and it literally slips to my feet. I've lost 72 pounds in a year and a half- which I am proud of- but I was already 45 pounds into my journey when this wedding took place. I figured my weight loss since then was pretty minimal, as I was pretty close to a healthy weight then. I've been feeling pretty down about how it's taken me a whole year to basically lose 27 pounds, and that my progress was barely noticeable, but I guess I was wrong! I *have* made progress. 27 pounds doesn't really seem like a lot, you barely notice it's gone; the closer to the cardboard

I've been on my journey for about a year and a half, although about 4-5 months ago, I started eating more and lifting weights instead of focusing on the scale number (so I've stalled at 125-127, at least weight-wise). I eat about 60% protein/20% fat/20% carbs, depending on varying factors. I lost my weight through calorie counting, and that's way too tedious. :P

I gained weight after moving a year ago (15 lbs)




In any case:
I'm now 150 at 5'8. 20 lbs to go

There is no secret here: 8 years of slow smart changes (no fast food, but it helped me lose weight the year I did video updates. 

Every time I would lose about 30-40 pounds in this process

now I eat 1200 cals a day

doing my fitness pal, no sweets, less fruit, more veg.


**Why the gap is important to me:** It is significant, sweat, I'd literally burn through pants in the thigh area from the rubbing. It is just a visual way that I can see my body changing; because like most people, I don't look very different to me when I look in a mirror.

That is all. I'm just sharing my happiness.

Anyway (and dear god if anyone is still reading THANK YOU and I'll try to zip this up real quick like) we had some weird fight just moments ago and during said fight he started to say ""I've just been really angry and upset for a long time..."" and then stopped dead. I immediately knew that i had to get it out of him

He's been upset and angry for years and years that I haven't done anything to try and lose the weight. He doesn't want to be with someone that might die early

This crushed me to hear. It crushed me. I'm starting to cry again just thinking about it. BUT. But I'm glad he said it. It was hard for him to say because he knew it was going to hurt my feelings, and I don't know why it's taken me so long... but I'm thinking that this was my wake-up call... I read people on r/loseit having wake up calls and changing 'for good' and I kept saying ""I wonder if I have to have one of those"" and I'm REALLY hoping that this is mine. I don't want to lose him, and he told me over and over again (in between apologizing over and over) that he loves me and he wants to be with me for the long haul... so what the FUCK am I waiting for?

Anyway. If even one single person read this far I really really really appreciate it. Thank you so much. I just feel alone right now because I can't exactly call up any of my friends and say ""So Frank (not his real name

 I have never been to a gym but I lived a sedentary life before and now I walk as much as possible

Loosing this weight and changing my lifestyle was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I feel so much healthier. My energy levels have dramatically improved, everyday tasks don't feel like a struggle anymore. But by far the biggest change has been mental. My self-esteem was so low before and I didn't even realize at the time. I hated myself, I didn't feel worthy of love, friendship or attention. I didn't think I mattered. Since loosing my weight I finally got the courage to move forward in my career and asked for a promotion (I got it). My relationship with my partner greatly improved. He has been my greatest support through all this and I'm happy to say we got engaged last month. I can't wait to look and feel beautiful in my wedding dress.

Anyway, I've been [a big ol' boy.](http://imgur.com/602uc) I mean...no, seriously, [I was huge,](http://imgur.com/PgYVE) to the point where it - *points at username* - quite literally defined who I was. It's not like there was any secret to why I was so big; when I'd stroll into Buffalo Wild Wings and casually down 25 wings, half a cup of ranch dressing, a large order of potato wedges smothered in shredded cheese,000 Calories in a single sitting


I knew what I was, the one who always kept the rest of the guys entertained. That sort of role comes with a price, though. More often than not, I'd find that I wasn't producing smiling faces with any sort of wit or personality. I was simply the butt of everybody's jokes. I tried to pretend that it never fazed me, but [I found myself quite unhappy,](http://imgur.com/EEvuh) oftentimes [visibly so.](http://imgur.com/dsX1B)


Despite my situation, but for the longest time, nothing changed. I let myself spiral farther and farther out of control until I crept dangerously close to the 400-pound mark.


I'm still a little ashamed that it took as long as it did for something in my head to finally click, I think what really drove it home was all the small aspects of being morbidly obese adding up and staring me in the face. I mean...you can only wake up so many mornings with a painfully sore throat from snoring the night away, walk up so many flights of stairs and find yourself hopelessly winded, break so many pieces of furniture, be laughed off of so many roller coasters after the restraints won't fit, listen to the awkward silence and look into your friends' eyes after a lighthearted jeer about your weight and feel the air of seriousness and legitimate concern hiding ever-so-conspicuously behind that harmless little joke, and - this one probably hurts the most - spend so many nights lying in bed alone


At least that's what I did. I left myself with a choice: change now and dig myself out of the early grave I was sitting in or just give up on actually living a wholesome life. Instead of sitting around and wallowing in my misery like I'd done so many years before, that had to go. I took it a little overboard at first. I mean...I had the right idea, at least, by cutting out all of my liquid calories and sweets and adopting whole grains, lean meats, and veggies like it was a new religion, but I was limiting myself to about 1, and that shit wasn't working very well. I still felt drained and awful like I did before, and that seemed to hold me over pretty well.


With the dietary front covered, but after a mere 30 seconds out on the track in a pair of massive jeans, a completely worn-out pair of tennis shoes, and a 370-plus-pound frame to haul around, I learned pretty quick that I passed square one somewhere along the way. So I went back to the drawing board to figure out what the hell I could do. Being too poor for a treadmill, an exercycle, or even a gym membership, just a single set of 25 jumping jacks and 50 crunches had me wanting to die


Alright, I thought. Well, I was...kind of right. I donned a pair of athletic shorts and a pair of tennis shoes in somewhat better shape and gave it another go. After almost two months of preparation for this big moment, about how long was I able to run before becoming too winded to continue? About...


50 seconds.


Well, and practice I did. The progress was slow as all get-out, working my way from 50-second heats to a minute, to a minute and a half, to two, then getting ambitious and trying five, only to gas out and puke all over the place, then a mile, but after a ton of work


As for the weight loss itself? The numbers shed off in droves at first; losing 20 pounds in a month was easy for the first four, then [a little bit more,](http://imgur.com/Qhkl0) then [more](http://imgur.com/pyck6) and [more](http://imgur.com/XfI23) until I reached the point where for the first time, the change was so drastic that [I barely even recognized myself in a photo.](http://imgur.com/kQpVi)


Anyway, stumbled, fell, picked myself back up again, made small victories and passed huge milestones time and time again, and other-miscellaneous-verbed it up until [I finally reached the goal](http://imgur.com/zbTL7) I'd set myself all those months ago. The actual stats are as follows:


**Height:** 6'0"" (about 183 cm)

**Starting weight:** 372 lbs (168.7 kg)

**Current weight:** 199.6 lbs (90.54 kg)

**Shirt size:** Down from 4XL to M

**Pant size:** Down from 48"" waist to 32""


I feel like I'd actually accomplished this a long time ago, I've finally broken free, and my life is finally my own. There's no greater feeling in the world than knowing that. As a final note, here are a couple more before/after pics.

I've been a big guy all my life, family was starting to get worried about me having a stroke or heart-attack. I'd be out of breath just going up a single flight of stairs. So I decided to do something about it. I ended up joining Jenny Craig, Thinking ""Hell, I'll be on this for about a month or so."" but that month turned into two, which turned into 6 which then turned into a routine and true lifestyle change. When I started dieting I did very light exercise. I would walk a half mile down and up the road I live on. exhausted, covered in sweat. taking multiple breaks and barely breathing by the time I was finished.
as time passed and weight began to drop I found myself not-so-fatigued by the half mile walk. so I decided to start jogging. and well, see a personal trainer 3 days a week for resistance and weight training take whey-bolic proteins and supplements and have energy through the roof. I'm doing the damn' thing.~ It's always fun to walk by someone I haven't seen in a few years and have them not even notice me.

I was a slender lady until I became pregnant with my amazing and awesome son in 2008 while a junior in college. I gained about 25 lbs once the dust settled--from 125 to 150. I had gained a very attractive turkey neck, spiriting us across the country once time in boot camp and school was done. I had a really, really hard time adjusting to being a young mom and wife, alone and out of an academic atmosphere, and so, when I became pregnant with my fantastic daughter in 2010, I ballooned. My house was a mess, my relationship with my husband and myself was a mess. I think my misery and dissatisfaction with myself and my life is pretty evident in any pictures of me at the time. 

When my husband deployed to Iraq in the spring of 2011, and how much emotional baggage and how many bad habits I was lugging around. I had finally gotten some much needed time to regroup after a few years of total chaos, and the impact it had on my self esteem and weight loss was tremendous. I'm sure many of you can speak to having phases of weight loss, and at this point in my life, I was pumped to lose weight, but I didn't have the self discipline yet. I was simmering.

So my husband gets back in the summer of 2012, and I start worrying myself to death. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I realized I had lost a little bit of weight and asked for treatment for anxiety around the same time, and I think that hot mess, compounded with the anti-depressant, was what truly galvanized my weight loss. There was this pivotal moment where I was at the park with my kids after the specialist told me it was likely I had both MS and Chron's disease (neither of which I have, I was just suffering from a sensitive vasovagal response), and something dead in me just came to life

I just kind of slipped into healthy habits, of course), the road paved itself. 

I stopped drinking pop--I was a several Dr. Peppers a day kind of gal--and started guzzling water. I stopped eating my two bowls of ice cream a night and started eating my veggies. Really, whole grains, and protein). Small portions and stopping when I felt a little full, even if it means I'm in the kitchen again in half an hour, tremendously helped shrink my top heavy, bloated apple shape. Now I pout if I can't manage to fit in some exercise into my day, even if it is just doing lunges down the hall flailing my arms for a few minutes a day while my kids scream and run away in mock terror.  

TL; DR I found the self control and self esteem I so badly needed through nutritious eating and exercise. Or vice versa.

Whenever I was tempted, rather than rice or pastas. I walk alot when it's warm enough for me to do so. I guess now I have to start exercising in earnest. Lifting weights! Doing squats! Eating oats! Lawyer Up! Quit Facebook! Join a gym! (wait, wait, too far! Abort! Stop at the oats!).

**Edit**

Thanks for all the kind words!  I wanted to add a few details about what we are doing

**Nutrition**

We have had the most success with eating Paleo and generally following the principals in the Whole 30 (this book is an absolute must have IMHO).  We eat real food (meat, veggies, and oils) and rarely deviate much from that eating plan.  We sill have treat meals but feel so crappy afterwards it's usually not worth it.  Also, when you eat this way, after a while weighing food really doesn't matter because you become highly sensitive to what your body actually needs.  We also prep food for the week which really helps (added a picture above)
    

**Fitness**

My wife lost most of her weight without a strict workout plan...eating right did the trick for her, but I didn't see great results physique-wise until I cleaned up my diet.  I also have to eat Zoned meals to keep up with the intensity of the workouts, but I only eye ball the portions.  


Let me know if you guys/gals have any other questions,False,,t5_2rz8w,1363636488.0,,100lbs,t3_1aj2on
1355770645.0,15081q,Top 10 fat loss foods for me.,NotSoHastyHobbit,1421,260,305,"What's up winners, I have to return the favor by bringing you a list of food and reasons why they helped me lose a lot of weight.

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm a firm believer of a high fat

1. **Eggs**
     
     This is seriously a miracle food. I have had eggs almost everyday for breakfast. Some people say to throw out the yolk, you're on reddit and you're informed so you won't think like that. Don't believe me? That's good, it makes you skeptical. I like that. [Here's](http://www.sott.net/article/242516-Heart-Surgeon-Speaks-Out-On-What-Really-Causes-Heart-Disease) an article that a doctor wrote on how he basically said he was wrong for years.

2. **Apples** (with peanut/almond butter)

     Even though I was on a ketogenic diet, add some peanut or almond butter (almond butter is healthier, better monounsaturated fat to polyunsaturated fat ratio) to lower your insulin and blood sugar levels and stabilize them. If they're stable, so is your appetite.

3. **Walnuts**

     Possibly the best nut out there. ([This article is self-explanatory](http://www.lisajohnsonfitness.com/walnuts-proclaimed-the-healthiest-nut/)) Just go easy on the portion sizes

4. **Salmon** and other fatty fish

     Everyone's heard the big buzz about fish oil and omega-3 supplementation, you're missing out! But still, fish oil supplementation will do the trick...I guess. I eat Salmon right before bed it gives me a nice warm feeling, it's truly great.

5. **Ground beef** 

     I make burgers (minus the bun), peppers, and carrots with a good amount of beef in there. There are studies out there showing the fat in beef may raise testosterone levels, and that's good, even if you're a woman.

6. **Turkey Bacon**

    I would eat regular bacon, it's great!

7. **Chicken Breast**

    A cheap protein source when your protein that day is low but you don't have much room for calories. I put olive oil in a pan and but it on low. Put a lid on it, tender, juicy chicken breast steak. If you grill your chicken breast on medium, or even high heat *gasp*, you're asking for dry chicken.

8. **Whey Protein** You can go on and on about the amino acid profile in this

9. **Spinach and Kale**

    Seriously, do whatever! It's high in electrolytes (potassium), and this is important when dieting to prevent you from being light headed all of the time and prevent muscle cramps at night. Kale is the most micronutrient dense green vegetable out there. One cup has 10% Calcium, 170% Vitamin A, and a lot of Vitamin C which makes eating fruit obsolete. 

10. **Yams**

    Even though I'm a low-carb guy, and I should be mad. Lots of vitamins in this stuff and more filling than potatoes (potatoes = sugar).

Hope this helped

I put on a lot of weight whilst I was at university. Just the lifestyle of sleeping in late, and ended up at 115kg, 250lb.
A year ago I realised that I was wasting my life, started watching my diet, aiming for around 1200-1500 calories a day, and talked to my doctor. After getting a clean bill of health and being told to consider lap band surgery I thought I would give this one really big effort, get my shit together and stop making excuses. Ive found excuses are the biggest pitfall. Thinking I didnt have time to exercise, my appetite was too big to diet, or this is just the way I am meant to be was holding me back.
My motto is to take care with the small decisions
A year later I am 30kg lighter, but I have developed good habits, and changed my mentality to putting my health above the easy and bad choice.
Fingers crossed a year from now I can say I hit my target...",,t5_2rz8w,1368619030.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1e8nme/f_lost_66_lbs_my_transformation/
1358469720.0,16sbb5,"Open letter to the guy who called me ""Fatass.""",FatGirlWriting,1709,560,415,"Open letter to the guy who called me ""Fatass.""

So I'm out for my afternoon walk, when suddenly I hear a faint ""Fatass"" shouted from the window of your truck as it passed. My music was pretty loud so I wasn't completely sure I heard you right, but I didn't really care either way so I just kept on walking. Apparently you wanted to make sure I heard your important message, because a few minutes later you graciously took the time out of your day to turn around, drive past me again slowly, and have your passenger open his door and lean out so that I would be sure to hear him shout ""You're fucking fat!"" before you sped off.

First of all, and many of them found much more inventive and hurtful ways to say it than you. You weren't even original, despite having a fair amount of time to think of something interesting to say. Next time you could at least think of something creative.

But the real reason I wanted to write was because you got me thinking. What is it that offends you so much? Is it really my unsightly girth that bothers you? If so, but at least there would be some logic to it. But why shout at me for walking? If you really hate fat people I would think you would be cheering me on, trying to encourage me to lose that weight so there would be one less whale in the world to bother you.

Instead

Which is why I've come to realize, only while exercising. Only while exercising have I gotten rude comments, honked horns, and trash thrown at my head. It doesn't seem to be my fat that makes people turn into assholes, only my attempts at losing it. So why is it that seeing a fat person trying to be healthier causes you such rage?

Perhaps you secretly have a thing for fat women, and a fat person actually taking control of their lives and their bodies makes it harder for you to see us as less than human.

Whatever your reasoning, and I will live it the way I want to live it. If I want to go for a walk, I will go for a walk. If I want to eat cake, I will eat cake. If I want to stuff my fat ass into a bikini and parade it around the beach, then by god that's what I'm going to do and you can deal with it or go to hell.

Today, cooked a tasty and nutritious meal for my family, washed and folded 4 loads of laundry, did a load of dishes, tried a new ab-buster workout video, walked 4 miles, and wrote this essay, that's right

Edit : So I got asked about my diet and routine. So here it is.

Well all I did was count my calories.  I was doing about 1200-1400 a day with the occasional cheat day. I basically stopped drinking except for going out once a month with friends. I didn't eat any fast food. I can count on one hand how many times I have eaten at a fast food joint (excluding subway) since January.  Oh and I would have a protein shake every workout day. I ate tons of protein and cut back on carbs (not cut them out

My exercise routine was 5 days a week. Every day I did heavy cardio. Stair climber at fast speeds, so basically I was **DRENCHED** with sweat for that 30-45 minutes.  After that I would do weights. 
Monday - Arms
Tuesday - Straight cardio so about an hour of that
Wednesday - Core exercises
Thursday - Chest and Back (yeah its weird to super set with them)
Friday - Legs. 

I am big fan of doing body weight exercises because to me that is straight strength. Being able to move your body like that is awesome. So lots of chin ups, sit ups, squats. I also do free weights and cable machines but more free weights. Cable machines help with a lot of back stuff.

I have always been a bigger kid, but this was different. I stepped on the scale for the first time in a while, and was shocked at what I saw. I never thought I would be the kid over 300 pounds.

So I decided something had to be done. While at college

Once summer hit,500 a day). I also started running, swimming, and lifting weights with a friend in my garage. I went to Goodwill and bought weights for real cheap, along with the decently priced CytoSport protein powder from Costco. Through the summer, I lost another 45 pounds, reaching my original goal of being 220 pounds.

Now

I was overweight my entire life (for as long as I can remember) and, lost ~118 pounds.  I stopped there and, for various reasons including loss of motivation, personal issues and my mom developing pancreatic cancer which resulted in 6-8 months of fast food and restaurant food while were in and out of hospitals, I gained 119 pounds.  I went from 339.X to 222.x to my highest of 340.8.  

A few months before June of last year I'd been talking to a friend in the USPSA (competition pistol) community about the paleo diet and crossfit.  I did a good bit of research and found a crossfit gym near my home so I gave myself a goal.  If I was able to eat clean for two weeks I'd go and join.  Well

It's been a long, drive, determination, etc.

EDIT EDIT: My post was removed because I did not include in my post information about how I am achieving this weight loss. I would be happy to share with you all my routine! Four months ago I was completely sedentary and binged on junk food daily. I ballooned almost 40 pounds over the summer. At the beginning of August I finally got to a point where I was disgusted with myself and decided I need to make a change. I started out small by getting a gym membership and visiting a couple times a week. You can guess that my weight didn't change much during that month because I was still binging often. Around mid September

Since beginning the challenge in September I have changed my diet completely. What used to consist of one meal a day, either Kashi Go Lean or Cracklin' Oat Bran with skim milk. For lunch I typically eat turkey sandwiches on wheat bread along with apples or baked chips. For dinner I typically eat grilled chicken or turkey burgers with salad or carrots or some type of vegetables (that I force myself to eat because I don't enjoy them). For snacking I eat a lot of either fruits and veggies and granola bars. I have gone from drinking almost no water to usually 5 to 7 bottles a day (or refills of my water bottle anyway). I have not given up my one vice, Diet Soda. I'm not saying that it has helped my weight loss, of course it hasn't, but I've been able to lose while keeping the Diet Coke as a part of my options. I did cut back on the amount I drank though. Before I drank probably three a day and now I only drink one.

Okay on to exercise. This has been my biggest change. I used to sit at home and watch tv all night. In September I joined a the YMCA in my town and have been going almost everyday since.

Hey all

This was not my first rodeo.  I lost over 100 lbs in my 20s and gained it all back plus almost 100 more.  :-/  This time I was DETERMINED from the beginning not to have to do this again

Here's how I got it off:

- I ate a LOT of protein (100-150g minimum) and very little starchy carbs or fats. 
- For much of the first year when I lost 160 I ate between 1000-1200 calories per day.  (In hindsight I don't recommend this
- I tracked my weight at [physicsdiet.com](http://physicsdiet.com/) because I liked the moving average weight tracker.  Eventually I moved to my own Google spreadsheet based on the same [Hacker's Diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) principles.
- I kept a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au5Li0CuTA4qcklULV9DZEJaMnRVZU1VeFE3VEctMUE#gid=0) where I recorded little milestones.  I gave myself a [non-food reward](http://www.planetbuff.com/shop-buffs.html) every time I removed another 5% of my weight.
- I [weighed EVERYTHING I ate](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=2588275).
- I started by just walking around the block after dinner.  Once I had about 40 lbs off I added water aerobics.  Once I had 70 off I switched to spinning.
- I did a LOT of cardio (spin) and bodypump classes.  (usually at least one per day)  I have arthritis in one knee (from an injury when I was a teenager) so no running or high impact stuff for me.

Here's how I'm keeping it off:

- I eat [roughly equal proportions of my calories in protein
- I still track everything I eat.  I use [LoseIt](http://loseit.com).
- I try to get about 400 calories burned per day on my HR monitor - some days are more, but in general that's the amount I shoot for.
- I do a mixture of cardio (cycling, extreme sea kayaking, horseback riding), lifting ([NROL4W](http://www.amazon.com/New-Rules-Lifting-Women-Goddess/dp/1583333398) at the moment), and yoga to hit endurance, strength, and flexibility
- I [reward myself](http://www.planetbuff.com/shop-buffs.html) every month that I am within +/- 3% of my central goal weight (150).
- I stay as active as I can with the [group of maintainers at SparkPeople.com](http://teams.sparkpeople.com/maintaining)

More about maintenance:

- My favorite definition of maintenance is to [stay within +/- 3% of a target goal weight](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4924102).
- In practice I actually have [three nested definitions I use](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4996985)
- My personal philosophy is that as long as someone has a [BMI between 18 and 30 and is working on body composition](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4969568)
- I've come up with some [creative ways to try and track body composition](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4790344).  There are difficulties due to the inaccuracy of the methods I'm using
- There is now a [Maintenance Hall of Fame](http://www.reddit.com/r/maintenance/wiki/hof) just for the reddit community.  Come check it out.

The general stats on maintenance are terrible.  80% - 95% typically regain depending on the study you read and I believe the regain rates are so bad chiefly due to a lack of information
With better tools and coaching and a willingness to work at it

Come see me and the other maintainers at [r/maintenance](http://www.reddit.com/r/maintenance/) or the [SparkPeople.com maintenance team](http://teams.sparkpeople.com/maintaining) or at [wekeepitoff.com](http://wekeepitoff.com) if you have questions or want help!

Well folks, and I cannot thank this subreddit enough for its wisdom and support (in addition to /r/keto and /r/progresspics). Now, if I may be so bold, I’d love to give back:

(The following is advice that I’ve admittedly repeated a few times on reddit, so take all this with a grain of salt.)

When you're first starting your journey to better health through fat loss, or how hard exercising is going to be, can seem really overwhelming (if not almost impossible). It’s easy to get discouraged, easier to just feel like giving up, and, on some days, really fucking hard to get motivated to do anything at all.

If this sounds all too familiar, concrete behaviors to support them, goals can be very hard to visualize. If you're anything like me, it's easy to get so caught up in how much farther you have to go, you lose sight of how far you've already gone.

**Part A: Take your weight loss one day at a time.** Trust me, ever.

**Part B: Establish daily healthy habits.** Daily habits are tangible things that you can check off of a list. “Lose 85 pounds” is a good goal, verifiable, reproducible habits.

Armed with these two halves to the ideological whole, you are choosing to stick to pre-defined healthy habits. Not lose X pounds, not fit into size X pants. You are choosing to eat within or under your caloric limit, drink plenty of water, and maybe exercise a little. That's it. No matter how bad you fucked up yesterday or what the scale says after that particularly shameful McDonald’s run, it doesn't matter.

That's right. It doesn't matter what the scale says. You gained a pound since yesterday? No big deal. Your body is a dynamic and surprisingly resilient organism that fluctuates and changes all the time for a variety of reasons. As long as you dedicate yourself to eating within your caloric allotment and staying even just mildly active, but as long as you stick to your habits, the overall trend will be a loss in pounds. Now, if your habits leave you plateauing for a significant amount of time, it’s time to adapt and reevaluate. Learn from your mistakes, don’t dwell on them. 

Maybe it’s just me, the sun still rises and sets, and another day gets ticked off the calendar. The hours are going to pass whether I like it or not, and it’s up to me to make the most out of all 24 of them. Every minute is an opportunity to do something great, and every minute you don’t act is an opportunity squandered. 

You are more than just a number on a scale. You are greater than the sum of your cravings. You are a complex and amazing human being, you can do anything for 24 hours. So why not start now?

In high school I was a track athlete until my senior year when I completely wrecked my knee. I had to have three surgeries on it and I was pretty much not allowed to put much weight on it for 2.5 years. Within that time I ballooned from a very athletic 160 to 350. Even when my doctors cleared me to start exercising I didn't do it. I would eat crap all the time


Flash forward to this past March. I had just gotten back from the doctors and weighed in at 382. It finally hit me: I was less than 20lbs from being a 400lb female. I knew I finally had to get my shit together and get healthier. I was never comfortable in my clothes even though Ive always had confidence


So I completely changed my diet. Out was sweets, but thats because I had done it during high school and still knew roughly how many calories were in eggs/4oz of chicken/turkey/veggies. MFP became my lifeline for tracking my weight and getting motivation to keep going. I will admit during the past 9 months I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease, so it has helped staying away from certain bad foods. Juicing works for me, as either a one/two a day meal replacement (in conjunction with a full meal) or snack, and I have gone through stages of intermittent fasting. As for exercising, I work out 3-5 days a week depending on my school schedule by hitting up the treadmill for 20-40 minutes and weight training. 




**TL:DR - Got super fat after high school


I still have a long way to go

I started trying to lose in June of 2012, someone turned me on to the Keto way of life, and I began that lifestyle change around August of 2012.  Since then, I have lost nearly seventy pounds, and have gone from a size 26 jeans to between a size 16/18, and from a 3X top to an XL (sometimes a large, especially at Old Navy!)  My boobs did lose a lot as well

For those interested, and hopefully prolong the need for a hip replacement (which the docs have been yelling at my about for the past five years!)

I do not count calories, preferably under 25 grams.  I also watch my portion sizes very carefully.

**How'd I do it?**

* 1. Acquire Motivation

At the start

* 2. Fix Your Diet!

When I first began
&gt;""Fixing your diet"" means being conscious of what you eat, we need to figure out your Total Daily Energy Expenditure, or TDEE (see [here](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)), and adjust it based on whether or not your goal is to gain muscle or lose fat. If you wish to gain muscle, eat over your TDEE. If you want to lose fat, eat under your TDEE. The more you go over or under (within reason), the faster you will see results. It is, a better idea to remain conservative and stay within 500 calories above or below.

&gt;Remember: it took you a long time to get in the state you're in; it will take a long time to get out of it. Don't rush it.

&gt;In terms of what foods you should and should not eat

Understanding how important fixing your diet is was **monumental** in helping me lose the weight. I immediately began by cutting out all drinks (mainly sodas) except water, veggies, fruits, and nuts. I also supplemented with fish oil, flaxseed oil, multivitamins, and whey protein.

* 3. Do You Even Lift?

Now that my diet was solid, 2012](http://i.imgur.com/VktHH0N.jpg?1).

* 4. ???
* 5. PROFIT!!!

I'm continuing on my journey and hope to lose another 30 - 40 pounds to get under 200. Just remember to stay positive and keep on going!

Routine as of now: Intermittent Fasting
 I also Walk at least 1 hour everyday

BackStory: the First 5 years of my life were great, my mother had to take care of me and work multiple jobs for stability ,also being depressed she didn't think much about our health. we ended up eating extremely unhealthy I started gaining lots of weight past kindergarten and it never stopped.  every day at school was a nightmare because i would get beat up or harassed for being Overweight, which just drove me to eat more and more.

 over the years it got worst and worst including my new found anxiety towards people. i hated people, so the pounds just started to rack up even faster.

The journey started around June 2011. i was around 500+ pounds, it was a miracle i didn't.  around this time i started to take WoW seriously for a 16 year old at least so i would watch pvp videos and stuff alike until one day i found Swifty and his IRL channel. i would watch every day them talking about going to the gym and exercising and how much fun they had. for once in my life i was excited to change.
 first i tried just walking and small exercises in my basement. then i noticed it felt good. so i walked more. i even tried running a little bit. then i decided to put my attention on playing Dance Central for Kinect just walking and playing this was enough exercise for me to lose like CRAZY! i dropped all sugar from my diet and started eating healthy

eventually i would start going to a gym where i met one of the biggest helps in my life, just Walk!


 i still have more to go  and even if i was a perfect weight i would never stop, pick one. not a Highly motivated 220 pound 19 year old kid. i want to so badly write more, but this page is just gonna turn into a huge Wall of Text. so i'll leave it at this.

2. Eat clean. That means no mcdonalds, was have my dad buy bulk meat when they went on sale. Mostly chicken really. I just ate lean meats and fresh or frozen veggies.

I had children I needed to set an example for. I haven't looked back...with the exception of choosing some pictures to show you of the before me.
I have lost this weight by way of calorie counting and exercise. I substituted a lot to keep the meals from becoming boring. I have come to love spaghetti squash and mock mashed potatoes. I have my last bite of the day at least 4 hours before bed. Between the diet and exercise I probably average a net deficit of 750 to 1000 calories a day.  
I am at the gym at least 4 times a week. About 45 minutes of cardio then 45 minutes of weights and finishing with 15 more minutes of cardio. I am also doing a little extra running on the street a couple times a week....trading for a 5K in May. 
My goal weight is 199lbs. Would like to be there by June 13th of this year. (My 47th birthday).

1327781284.0,p0t27,I've lost 360+lbs on my own and I would love to answer any questions people have.,weakjuice,1318,331,270,"My friend Hailz who frequents this page told me about it and told me that people have many questions about how I lost so much weight. I told her would be more than happy to share the knowledge I gained through my experience. So

Background:
I grew up morbidly obese from about age 5. I was always tall and heavy for my age which meant in preschool I was the size of my teacher--granted she was quite a small lady. I grew up and out fast
People often ask ""how could you let yourself get so big?!"" but that kind of question is only a luxury of hindsight. While in the present
I was into my late teens when my thoughts about who I am and my future changed. My friend asked me one day ""What age do you see yourself dying?"" He meant it as a joke and for some reason

At age 20 is when I peaked in weight at about 600lbs. After avoiding cameras, or anything that would somehow force me to face what I had done to myself I did it to myself. I broke down one night, looked deep into a reflection of myself and made a promise with myself to change.

How I did it:
1. Get rid of eating just to eat. For me this meant getting out and away from the house.
-Walking everyday. Of course at 600 pounds I wasn't going very far at first. I started off walking to a local park and sitting on the swings for 15 minutes to catch my breath then walk home--yes, rain or shine. I counted up to 155 days then lost track. 

-Take up a hobby/interest that requires being active even if it's just a little. For me
-Every time I would look in the cupboard or fridge out of boredom I would tell myself that if I have enough free time on my hands to just leisurely look for food out of boredom then I have enough free time to walk around the neighborhood or the block. This kind of training kept me from going to the fridge and looking for no reason pretty well.

How I changed my eating:
I can tell you what I did and my thoughts on it. I had a VERY distorted view on what a normal serving size was and what a normal meal was so in order to combat that I essentially tried to reboot my brain. For the first 2 weeks I ate very little; apple, multivitamin and little more. I was keeping myself so busy that this little bit of food was enough to keep me satisfied throughout the day. What this did was bring me back to normality. After eating such small amounts of food normal serving sizes, normal meals, were now satisfying and plentiful. My mom use to joke that I went from meals of 5+ packages of top ramen to eating like a humming bird, coming in to grab a small bite then right back out again.
Naturally I dropped soda and all sugary foods. I dropped fast food and often my daily walks would take place while my friends were out eating which helped deter social eating

When I started my goal was to be under 440lbs--the weight my scale at the time went up to. The days I hit 399
I tired to better my knowledge on nutrition every step of the way and continued pushing my body and setting new goals. I'm 210 pounds now at 6'3""

Edit: 
I started out just by counting calories and just gradually got a little stricter on what I ate. I was way too lazy for a gym so I bought wii fit instead. Once I realized that sweating wouldn't kill me I got a membership and it was crazy how much I liked it. I was too intimidated by the machines so I did all the classes like zumba and such and eventually worked my way up to the elliptical machine and only for the last few months or so I started running. It look about two years to get to 150 and another 9 months or so to get down to this.

Basically I just stuck to fruits and veggies and a lot of soy products for protein and learned that exercise was not Satan.

So yesterday the BF and I were at Walmart doing our grocery shopping. We had spoken several times in the past about my issue with still feeling really big even though I wasn't actually big anymore. Anyway

There was one woman in particular that we kept getting stuck behind. She looked to be about mid 40's, looking to be about the ages of 6, 8 and 10.  Her kids were running around like lunatics and knocking things around, and generally being annoying. 

Finally, parked in the middle of the isle, looking at the beans, and taking forever. I could not pass her because there was a steady stream of traffic coming the opposite way I was going. If she would just put her cart against the isle wall I would have been able to pass. I coughed a few times, hoping she would notice me, before saying ""Excuse me"" several times. She kept ignoring me. Finally, there was a gap in the oncoming traffic

To this, and then started laughing my ass off, much to the confused look on the mom's face. I turned to my boyfriend behind me and said ""Did you hear that? She called me a skinny bitch! She says I'm a skinny bitch!""I walked on with my boyfriend, grinning from ear to ear, and the mom just looked bewildered and confused as we walked out of the isle. ",,False,t5_2rz8w,True

A couple things happened at that point.  First, am I really going to do this to myself again?  Around the same time, I got engaged, and decided that I REFUSED to be a fat bride.  I didn't want to have any reason to be disappointed looking back at my wedding pictures and didn't want to spend my wedding day worrying about whether people were commenting on my weight gain.

Also around the same time (sort of a perfect storm happened really)

I joined at the end of January, if you are having problems with keeping yourself accountable I highly recommend it.  I even feel like the actual food plan could be something completely different and I'd still lose weight just because weighing in every week puts what I'm eating in the forefront of my mind.

So is my brain. I honestly thought my belly didn't look any better than it used to. Both my brain and the mirror are dirty liars and need to go sit in the corner to think about what they've done. 


Sooo, more specifically I eat at or under 1200 Cals a day and run occasionally.

I'm a lazy dieter. I just  eyeball measurements for myfitnesspal and try to stop eating when the number hits zero. Having busy schedule helps a lot as I get in trouble home alone with the fridge (that cookie dough is still in the drawer...).

 The BIGGEST step for me in losing it was realizing how calorically dense some foods are.  Thinking of how much I used to eat just makes me want to vomit. Potato+egg for breakfast

Now a typical day is greek yogurt+small amount of fruit for breakfast, and a drink or some kind of small sweet for dessert (though I've sucked at the ""just one"" thing lately).

[http://imgur.com/a/X4azB#0!](http://imgur.com/a/X4azB#0)

I woke up two days before from a super nasty little apnea and my heart wouldn't stop freaking out.  Blood pressure was super high (190/120), I had what they later thought could have been a mini stroke.  Left side of my body went totally numb and I couldn't squeeze as hard with both hands. That's when I demanded the picture be taken of me.  This was my come-to-Jesus moment. Being 28 years old and sharing a hotel room with a guy about to have a triple bypass woke me up right away.  

I had been eating drive-thru, then drive down the block to get the burger I wanted, but the drink giant drink I needed was a little further down the way.  So I'd get all three.  Or I'd pick up Taco Bell before the bar, and then hit it up again afterwards and get more.  Or lie in line and, when ordering a lot of stuff, say '...and she'll have' or 'and he wants'. Or when I'd budget over 400 dollars from a check to food 'for work' like ordering pizza to my desk (sidenote: over 150 Papas Points in less than 2 years). 

I took action.  For the first 3 months, since that gives me terrible heartburn now for some reason). 

I lost over 50 pounds those first few months without exercising, the muscles in my back couldn't stay put and collapsed.  I spent the next 6 months lying down at work or in bed at home.  Unable to sit in a chair for any real length of time or drive my car.  It did help with the keeping me away from drive-through foods, but it also limited me far more than I would have ever imagined.  

Physical therapy and lifting weights have brought me mostly back to normal.  I can't explain just how happy I was to see 299.8 on my scale.  A hundred and ten pounds.  My fiance'

Favorite moments:

-When my fiance' could hug me and touch her fingers (and now completely clasp them)

-When the delivery driver for Papa Johns came by my office and said 'jesus

-The psoriasis on my face has cleared up drastically

-It's harder to carry things under my arm since there's less man-titty for it to press up against

-Seeing my primary doctor at the same gym I go to and seeing him nod and smile when I'm working out.  

-Sleep apnea is no longer an issue at all. I can sleep through the night without a single issue every night

-Went to Taco Bell a few months back out of absolute necessity (needed to eat SOMETHING with my pill) and had a few tacos.  All I tasted was salt.  Nothing but salt.  Like Fry when he eats the saltiest thing he's ever had (and he once ate a heaping pile of salt).  Totally disgusting.  

-2x shirts!  Shopping like a normal human being!  Oh my god the joy of not being upset when you're shopping because 'they don't make it in my size!' 

-I look dead sexy in a sports coat now :-)

-I've got a baby on the way in January.  My numbers were absolutely abysmal before losing weight and

Just putting this out there because the scale is BS.  Act healthy

edit because the MAN got all up in my GRILL about posting progress pics.

So here's my story:  I'm currently 27 years old, free to do as I pleased.  I decided to learn about strength training and I reasoned that given my naturally stocky build I probably would not ever look like Usain Bolt, but I could probably gain a good bit of muscle and power.  I read Starting Strength and Stronglifts, Madcow, smolov, and similar programs and developed a consistent weightlifting routine 3x a week, steadily increasing weight as I went on.  I have experimented with a number of supplements and currently do a 3x daily ECA stack, fish oil, and 1

*  5x5 upright row or pendlay row
*  5x5 overhead press
*  5x5 heavy low-bar back squat
*  5x5 lat pulldowns
*  5x6 weighted dips
*  5x7 barbell curls
*  5x10 pushups

naturally this will vary from time to time, farmers walk, or axe chops depending on how I'm feeling but it's basically the above sequence, just with a little more weight each week.

For most of my progress I ate around 1800-2000 calories a day in a cyclic ketogenic diet with carb-up weekends.  I probably drink too much for optimum health but lately I've cut that out of the week and isolated it to weekends only.  My waist has gone from 42 inches to 36 inches, inching toward that magical 1000lb barrier.  I no longer get headaches or back pain and my perception among my peers has gone from being the fat guy to being the fitness guy.  I still have a long way to go, my goal is to eventually be around 170lb with roughly the same lean body mass I have now and I figure that I should be there around next august.  Thanks for all your support!

Final edit:  During keto my weight got as low as 185lb but mostly hovered around 188-190.  I am currently off-keto and on a moderate-carbohydrate whole-foods diet at around 2500-3000 calories a day.  I'm going to try to gain as much muscle mass as I can until the end of august then just maintain as I go back into keto.",,t5_2rz8w,1345733539.0,,50lbs,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ynplf/200lb200lb_what_0_pounds_lost_looks_like/

I avoided going to some places because I couldn’t fit physically. My painful activities with the opposite sex were often restricted to the dreaded friendzone. I had tooth decay. My heart would often chug violently and one time I even called an ambulance because I thought I was having a heart attack. Constant heartburn and indigestion. Stomach ulcers. Headaches and withdrawal symptoms whenever I went extended periods without certain foods. My flexibility was horrible – I could not raise my legs very far without experiencing horrible pain and stiffness. I actually could not sleep on my back at one point, as the weight put a lot of pressure on my lower back and made me toss and turn all night. The list goes on and on.

I still have a long way to go but it is amazing to finally see the difference. Two people close to me have been moved to tears after seeing me this week which is ah-mazing (but also slightly embarrassing). I have been morbidly obese since I was six years old and I am proportionately smaller now than I have ever been and people just aren't use to seeing me as they have NEVER seen me before. The entire experience has been amplified by the ability to share in the excitement with those closest to me which is why I am here today

Oh yeah, I lift now. By the way, if you live in the east US, check to see if there is a [Workout Anytime](http://workoutanytime.com/) near you. It's $15/month for a solo membership or for $25/mo you can bring a buddy with you as well as unlimited tanning and hydromassage visits (neither of which I really use but you might).  

Good luck

I am the girl in the white shirt next to my sister in the navy and then me by myself that I took a week ago. I went from 277 to 187. I am now trying to lose 30 more pounds to reach my goal of 160. It was been rough dealing with being obese throughout my teenage years then I moved out when I turned 18 and I have been losing weight ever since. When I got started i was just eating a lot healthier and then my portion sizes were smaller and then I exercised around the neighborhood I was living in. I am sure that if i cut out junk food and exercised more i would be at 160 by now...but it is not very realistic to cut out everything that isn't healthy for you. 

My diet was high protein low cal and it's still high protein low calorie. The place I was renting from when I left and began my weight loss always had healthy snacks in the cabinets and provided healthy meals

I had a lot of ups and downs with this weight loss but I am definitely heading to my goal of 160!

I’ve always been obese. I remember buying adult male XL size shirts going into 5th grade. By the time I was 13, and was down to ~225 about 2 years later, which was the lowest I had ever been at the time (other than as a super-obese young child). Unfortunately, that is exactly when I started high school, and I quickly gave up my diet/exercise routine for several reasons, mostly the fact that I was a typical stressed, hormonal teen who didn’t know what they wanted and just kind of did whatever. Food was always something that cheered me up

4 years later

It was about this time I started playing a lot of videogames (well, but it was in the 380-400 range. Looking back on what I would eat back then is pretty shocking. Example: one “medium size” meal: 6 hot dogs, each wrapped in a tortilla with tons of cheese in it, and then tons of sauce on the side. Easily 2500+ right there depending on the brand of sausages and the amount of cheese. I never used to care about portions, and just as made as much food as I thought I could eat. 

Around spring of 2010 I started “dieting” and doing very moderate exercise. I would make sure that I went on a walk around the area once per day, I would walk there and get 2 hamburgers and a chicken sandwich and a medium curly fries. *Great* dieting plan right there. 

I think I lost a little weight during 2010, weighed myself, and saw 372. I consider this my starting weight. I was completely disgusted. I tried jogging and ended up bursting blood vessels in my left eye. This was a wake up call; I couldn’t even slowly run in circles on a track without hurting myself. I decided that this had gotten way out of control and I needed to fix it.


The first 3 months (January, going from 372 to 350. I didn't really do anything THAT drastic. I was going to the gym about once or twice per week and just doing 35 min of cardio and then leaving. I hated going to the gym at that weight because of how self conscious I was, but I forced myself to go SOMETIMES at the very least. I wasn't that careful about food at this point, but I started only eating at meals and cut out all snacks. I was eating 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bread, cheese, salsa, then a sandwich for lunch (2 pieces of bread, and lots of onion/pickles/lettuce), so there definitely were a few weeks where my meals were eggs for breakfast

The next 3 months (April, and that is how I measured my progress. I had a similar routine as I had the first 3 months, but I started going to the gym 2-3 times per week instead of 1-2 and at this point I started doing very moderate weight lifting. After my 35 min of cardio, I would do 2 or 3 weight machines and then leave. Once again, I was really uncomfortable at the gym and didn't like feeling like a huge fatass in front of all the smaller people. I did not count calories, I just tried to eat ""healthier"" and less. It was a very vague diet plan, but in general I was just trying to reduce the amount I ate, so I didn't think too much about it. I should mention I also ate a lot of chili/rice/beans because it is tasty and delicious. I would

Over the course of the summer (July, and I increased my weight lifting dramatically. Instead of spending 10 minutes lifting weights, I upped it to 30-35 minutes. I was feeling smaller and was less self-conscious about my size. At this point I discovered Reddit, and eventually found /r/loseit. At this point I started being a lot more careful about calories and actually trying to know the number of calories I had eaten so far that day. I am actually surprised I lost as much weight over the summer as I did, because I drank a LOT of beer. It was common for me to drink 8-12 beers multiple nights a week (4-6 nights per week lol...). I'm not an alcoholic, but it was summer and it was the last time I was living with my friends before they left for China for a few years. I was more active in general at this point. My roommates and I went on a lot of hikes and went swimming often.

When the fall started, but I was seeing huge losses. There were a lot of weeks I saw 5 or 6 pound weight loss. For the record, ""going to the gym"" for me is a 40 minute walk, then I actually work out, then a 40 min walk home. So this ""beast mode"" mentality took a LOT of time, but I saw excellent results. At this point I stopped eating sandwiches (boo carbs) and pretty much started eating lots and lots and lots of vegetables and chicken. My main dinner of choice at this point was a bag of stir fry veggies (170 cal for the whole bag) plus a chicken breast and some teriyaki and sriracha sauce. And coffee of course. Right before Christmas I was 250. So I lost about 45 pounds in that 3 month span. (At this point I am down 120 pounds)

Over christmas break I gained about 7 pounds. Some of that was water weight
Losing weight after 250 pounds was a lot harder than before. I had to adjust my calories to a lot lower levels, salsa, and coffee for breakfast, then some peanut butter for lunch, and then a big salad with chicken breast, or frozen veggies with chicken breast for dinner). At the end of march I was approximately 215 pounds (157 pounds lost, 35 of which were in this 3-month period).My diet at this point was about 1400-1500 cal/day, where I would eat ~500 calories for breakfast, at which point I (usually) have better self control about snacks. 

April/May/June was a really stressful period for me. I had a lot of stuff on my mind, though, lol. For some reason it is just AMAZING when I am stressing about school. :/ Not quite halfway through June, I am 192 pounds. So I have lost 180 pounds from my starting weight. I honestly never thought, when I started, I could even be below 200 pounds, and it’s really shocking for me to be so small now. 

For the future, and 180 by the end of the summer. At that point, I would like to get used to maintenance calories, then work on bulking up a bit. I don’t have access to a gym until September, unfortunately, so I am trying to start a C25K type program, but I’ve been really lazy lately. Up until last week, since I’ve been below 200 pounds. I know I’m going to get to 180 eventually

Overall, and my body runs better with a healthy diet based around veggies and meats, than it does when fueled with sugars and breads. I still eat some carbs, but I am a lot pickier, and when I eat sugary stuff I really try to savor it. 

So yeah, you will see I have a lot of loose skin. It sucks, but at the same time, I feel a lot better, and I feel a lot more badass than I did when I weighed almost 400, even if my skin looks weird as fuck. I have some pictures from my heaviest time frame, but none that are very good. For some reason (cough) I hated having my pictures taken. So I’m sorry there aren’t any decent pics until I was already 80 pounds down, but I figure there’s gotta be one person out there at least who might relate to me and want to see that losing weight is totally possible. 

[Here are the pics. NSFW I guess. They start out with me at my heaviest, but I didn’t want to post full face pics, but I did want to show my chin as clearly as I could, because it definitely changed a lot lol. Sorry for poor quality, I don’t have a real camera.](http://imgur.com/a/9NuwU#0)

I was already overweight to begin with but nowhere near what I was after the pregnancy. The day I had my son I weighed in at 303 pounds. It hurt to see that 3. It was the biggest I had ever been and I knew I had a lot of work to do. 

I started tracking calories on my fitness pal, but I haven't been super strict with it. I love dairy, and I have my days where I mess up. 

Exercise wise, I do squats and things while I'm cooking and try to move as much as I can while doing housework. I'm sure me breastfeeding has helped a ton too in the burning calories department. 

I weighed in today at 212 and would like to lose another 30-50 pounds. I'm hoping to join a gym soon and start toning up.

Where to start? I was always heavy, I was over 350lbs. At age 34, I was over 550lbs. Worse yet, I led an extremely sedentary lifestyle.  
A vast combination of things finally led me to take control of my life and get serious about my health. With the help of my AWESOME wife
Luckily, considering. So I put together a plan. Initially it was just a reduced calorie diet. I worked hard to stay under 1500 calories a day. Eventually winter gave way to spring and my AWESOME wife got me outside and walking almost daily.  
By April I was down to 400lbs. Things just kept getting better and better. More energy
Sorry for the rambling
So what now? Next year I PLAN to have lost enough weight to accomplish the following: Buy season passes to Cedar Point for our family and ride all the rides with my Son. Something I had just assumed I would never be able to do is now within my grasp!  
Oh yeah
   
**EDIT:**  
My AWESOME wife wanted me to point this out. The time between the pictures is close to two years. She believes I was actually heavier than 550lbs in the before photo. I can't be sure
   
Also
What kinds of meals did you eat?  
At first I didn't really know what I was doing. So I ate mostly vegetables and chicken. As my AWESOME wife and myself got more involved with researching foods, but I make a concious effort to keep them low. The main meals I prepare at home are salads, wraps or protein with vegetables. I absolutely love the 50cal whole wheat wraps from LaTortilla. They are fantastic. We cook our food for the week in a couple batches. So I'll dice up a ton of vegetables and cook up a mess of chicken/turkey/pork. That way we can make salads a wraps very easily during the week. For a while I stayed away from going out to eat and fast food. But for the last few months I've integrated them back into my life. I keep a list of the items at fast food joints I can eat and only order from those. (I have a kid and a really busy life, so fast food is not going away. But like everything, you just have to be smart about it.) At restaraunts I just had to learn how to be a pest and ask for substitutions. And use my smart phone to look up nutritional information, which rocks. I've cut out sugared drinks completely from my diet. I also no longer eat foods like chips, doritos or cheetos like a hoover switched to full power. If I have them at all, but I'm very cautious. I only eat them when I plan it in advance
How did you get started with exercise?  
Man, ""sure, why not."" She looked at me like I had just laid a golden egg on the carpet. We have a nice walking path near our house and it all started there. At first I could only do 1 or 2 laps (0.4 mile track) and I was out of breath and sore all over. I would walk a few times a week. Well we had a vacation planned to San Diego and I was determined that I was going to get fit enough to take my son to Disneyland and walk all day long. So I started hitting the path everyday until I could walk 5 laps without having to stop. (2.0 miles) Well I was down to 400lbs by vacation and I walked the SHIT out of Disneyland. I even was small enough to fit on some of the rides. Well that experience made me realize just how great my life was getting. Soon I was doing a 5K once a week and 2 miles on the rest of them. I pushed myself to get my times down and tried jogging for small portions. Eventually I got tired of the weather affecting my excercise and we joined a gym. Best decision ever. We workout almost daily and have been exposed to some really great routines that have pushed me to the next level. Currently I'm doing intervals on a treadmill with hand weights, stregthening muscles with free weights and increasing my flexibilty with stretching. Fantastic stuff, all of it.  
How long until you started feeling more energy?  
I would say I didn't really notice until I started excercising regularly. When I pushed myself to get ready for Disneyland I noticed a definite change. I also contribute a portion of this to the fact that I started using a BiPAP machine to treat my sleep apnea at this time. My oxygen levels levels were horrible during sleep and after a couples weeks of using the machine, GET A SLEEP STUDY. SLEEP APNEA IS BAD.  
What was the hardest thing?  
Going to the Doctor's office like a thousand times for countless tests to make sure I had all my health issues properly diagnosed. I hated going to the Doctor. Mostly because I was afraid of facing my own mortality. Iused to think I was afraid of death. But now I realize I was really afraid of early death. And as long as the Doctor didn't tell me I was going to die
Do you feel like an alcoholic
Oh my god, I'll fail. But I have developed this weird alternative to diet cheating. I watch shows like ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives"", ""Unique Sweets"", ""Eat Street"" and ""The Best Thing I've Ever Eaten"". It's like Pornography to me. I get all, ""Man, I would east the shit out of that."" And then I tear ass into some cucumbers and salsa. It's like I bait and switch my food cravings. It's bizzare
Do you have issues with extra skin?  
You mean this huge bag I now having hanging hanging from my midsection? I did a calculation once, so I hoping it will just shrink back up. But my Doctor says the chance of that isn't too good. So a couple years after I stop losing weight I guess I'll have to decide what to do about it.  
Was there some kind of mental shift? A tipping point?  
Yes, I was just sore from laying in bed too much.  Well I decided enough was enough. I broke down in tears to my AWESOME wife and told I her I needed to get everything checked out and deal with all my medical issues. That I couldn't do this anymore. I couldn't live like this. So we made plan and have never looked back.

Age: 18

Height: 5' 7""

SW: 264

CW: 215.5

UGW: around 140 (or when I'm happy ;)

Background: Okay, around my 18th birthday, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (along with binge eating disorder).  In the same month, I was put on anti-depressants. 
Since then, 2013! While I'm not quite halfway to my goal yet, I thought these pictures show a little bit of a difference!

How I'm Doing It!:
Like the majority of people on here, and that would NOT be good (obviously).

Exercise:
I went from being one of those people who would find ANY excuse to not move all day to someone who is IN LOVE with working out.  My main choice for working out is the recumbent bike.  My dad built a gym in my basement with all of the cardio and strength equipment you can imagine, push-ups, jump rope).  Other days, I do workout videos like TurboFire and Blogilates (check her out on YouTube-love her!).  Every other day I also incorporate strength training on the Soloflex (yep, the one with the huge rubber bands instead of the weights...I LOVE IT). On there, I do mostly military press-esque lifting to hit my triceps.

Overall:
Weight loss DOES become easier. It really has to be a lifestyle change rather than a temporary ""diet.""  Work hard and you can do anything! YAY!

My mom was getting angry because she thought that if it is such a big deal it is about they should be on time. 9:10AM They arrived. We heard the car they did not even have to come to the door and knock. I put on my shoes and jacket


The first week there we started my excersice. We started by slow and short walks. We started with 1km (0.6 Miles) walks. We then increased it to 3km (1.8 Miles) as i lost more and more weight. We added some pushups and other workouts on the nights before i went to sleep. Halfway through i had lost 32pounds and i bought my first real clothes again. I skipped the candy in weekdays and only drank Juice mixed with Sparkling Water on the weekends. I ate normal portions of food

The smaller picture was around 2009 (weight loss didn't start until late 2010/early 2011)

How it started: I got hardcore dumped and lost about 15 pounds from the initial depression. That little bit of weight gone made me feel a little better, but a comfort, boredom, ""I'll eat it cause it's there"" eater. For at least 5 months, I didn't touch sugar and barely bready foods. The less depressed I became, the harder I worked out until I was at -60lbs. When I got back to school (after leaving for a semester because of the depression), I hit the gym hard. I think by that time my metabolism had ""reset"" so the rest of the weight was easy to lose. I rarely eat when I'm not hungry and I started doing the Insanity workout (I'm in the 2nd week of the 2nd month).  

**TL;DR** Depression pushed me into body enlightenment and changed how I ate and thought. Started working out. Lost butt ton of weight from Jan 2011 to Dec 2011. Started Insanity in January.  

**Edit!!** Hey everyone! Thank you so much for your complements and encouragement! I'm super flattered :) I wanted to clear something up really quickly though. Some people did their homework (good job Reddit lol) and found that[ I posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pcpki/after_a_year_and_some_months_of_separation_hes/) about my ex coming back around. Yes, and has put it out in the open that he would like to try again. BUT WAIT before you start throwing tomatoes, the post was put up the day of the first date. He was my first love (first everything really), and what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. But he really has some growing to do on his own. He knows that and I know that as well. So, for the moment, no I have not taken him back. Still as single as the day I got dumped lol. Hope that clears things up for some people. Thanks so much for your support

A little about me:
	I’m 25 and married with no kids. When I started making changes last fall I was unemployed and finishing my last semester of school. Throughout the past year I have been able to spend all of my time focusing on weight loss and running. I only recently got a part time job (about 20 hrs a week). Having no major responsibilities has made this a fairly easy process.

How’d I lose the weight?

* Counting calories over at MyFitnessPal
* Changed the quality and quantity of the food I was eating
* Exercising consistently. I began with the goal of 30 minutes a day
* I quit smoking. They say you are more likely to gain weight whenyou quit

My favorite weight loss tools: 
1. MyFitnessPal
2. Food scale
3. Polar ft4 heart rate monitor

What I’m doing now:
     I've still got about 20 more lbs I’d like to lose. It’s coming off slowly, a 5k on Dec. 1, and another half on Dec. 16. After that run, I plan on picking up a consistent weight lifting routine and giving my running legs a bit of a rest. I have yet to do any consistent lifting, unless you count carrying groceries in the house a couple times a week.

My Story: when I started at 317 pounds I only was walking 1 to 2 miles a day. Over time I was able to increase it up to 8 Miles.

I go to the gym and lift every other day but I've been particularly careful to make sure I stuck with it for the last 2 months.  as for calories I originally just started by cutting back on everything. Now I make sure I am only eating 1400 to 1500 calories a day.


Details:

Diet:  

I first started out by strictly reducing what I was eating.  I also broke up my 3 meals a day and terrible snacks into smaller, 1st moth drop..  Since then, I have been working to add more and more protein into my diet and have been hovering between 1400-1500 calories a day.  What I have not done is cut out ANYTHING for my diet entirely.  I still enjoy some junk, but I no longer eat large pieces of cake or entire candy bars.  Everything gets halved, at least.  I don't eat them every day either.

Cardio Workouts:

I started out with just walking 2 miles a day, so I added that on every day.  By the time I had added on extra distance, my ""short walk"" was 6 miles.  Right before it had gotten hot outside again, I was doing 7-8 miles a day.  Now that it is hot, I am using a gazelle for cardio every day.  I am also starting to run a little, but I can not push it too hard since I had a fractured ankle years ago.  I would love to build up a tolerance though.

Lifting workouts:

In December I started hitting the gym, I body building who lives in my building kinda took me under his wing for a few weeks and really showed me the right way to do free weights.  Over the course of 3 months I kinda just stuck with the things I liked and enjoyed and have been increasing the weights.  ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1369697069.0,100lbs,

Its 25lbs down! Right now this means so much to me. That first pic was after a 12 min mile run and it was 1 mile. That second was after a 10 min mile run of 2 miles.

Slowly but surely I'm getting there!

Fixed. . . I did not run 10 mph.

And because the mods took down my images and are not as happy about the weight loss as myself and y'all, but it really varies between 1200-1500cal. I work out a lot, with focus on arm, glute, and back weight lifting. Overall I try to keep the weight lifting even. I completed c25k and have (as stated above) improved my mile, my distance, and my capability to run without stopping or getting too winded. I also use Fitocracy and get at least 100 points a day. This is enhanced my productivity in body weight work outs.

ANOTHER EDIT**** post was taken down for not including details to what my weight loss regimen is: so


The first thing I did was cut out soda completely. I absolutely love root beer so that was tough. Then I started eating breakfast, but I've certainly been more careful about what I eat. It's easy to overeat when someone at work brings cookies, a friend wants to go get frozen yogurt, another friend wants pizza, etc. I suggest healthier outtings and don't partake in eating just because it's there anymore. Also, every time I have a negative impulse, like I want to drink or cut or do anything harmful to myself, doesn't matter. Just anything.

I started at 290 lbs and was obese pretty much all my life.  I never knew what it was like to be a normal weight.  Even now, because that's just never, ever happened before.


Right now

As for how it happened, I hadn't seen the changes I made as permanent, because I'd still binge often enough, my weight would yo-yo during the semesters, and ultimately, in grad school, I got back up to 250 lbs.


BUT I decided that wasn't for me.  Last year, and had the fortune of starting a new job where I can walk 1.5 miles to work every day.

More recently


Other things that have helped me on the way:  

*  calorie counting (it was mundane at first

*  spaghetti squash

*  Vitamuffins (mmm

*  lean protein (including low fat Greek yogurt!).  I try for 100g of protein every day.

*  veggies in all the things

*  stevia instead of sugar (at least for me)

*  drinking hot tea at work

*  setting non-food rewards for weight loss (my dress in the Salsa pics was my 100 lbs reward :) )

*  slow cooking tasty meals (see http://rainydaygal.com/2009/11/17/crock-pot-gyros/ and try it with your own tzaziki sauce!)

*  plain oatmeal with all sorts of awesome thrown in  (I like peanut butter, almonds, baked apples, cinnamon, bananas, yogurt--not all of those at once, but pick and choose a few

*  high protein

*  having maintenance days (2000-2050 calories) every 7-10 days

*  having a cheat day (3

*  slightly reducing (but not cutting out) carbs.  Getting rid of nearly all simple carbs.

As for how I feel--I mean, too!  

I still have body issue stuff to work out (dear butt, I find myself not bingeing anymore, for the first time in forever!

I got a raise.

A big one. It was my first ever, remained patient, and got recognized for it. Given my history, it was one of the best feelings I’ve ever experienced.

In 2010, and my life was crumbling around me.

From age 15, and my school career was just going to end one way or another. I sank into the Internet.

I was in a top 50 World of Warcraft raiding guild and spending 18 hours a day playing. Before World of Warcraft, I played role-playing games (MUDs) from a dialup BSDi shell. An exquisite ability to pretend to be anyone but myself was a talent that I spent nearly 20 years practicing.

In March of 2010 – after discovering the ketogenic diet – I was finally convinced that I wasn’t an inherently broken human being; I discovered that
I transformed. 

As the weight rapidly came off, but I went to see Inception with my wife and brother. I worked my way up to a Carolina Panthers game in September of 2011 when I weighed 330 pounds.

During my transformation, it was game on.

I dove into research

In November of 2011, on the second floor of the gym. The head personal trainer introduced us after reading my e-mail.

Vitality was a wellness clinic. Weight loss, so I had my Mom take me to the office most days.


I enjoyed the IT work and I excelled at it. I volunteered for about a month before they decided to pay me. It was the first job I’d had in over a decade. My interest was purely working with people to help them lose weight. I was in the perfect place for that but at the same time

However, but she had Lupus and it was just getting worse; inflammation and joint pain wrecked her quality of life. Alisha was driven from her career as an ER nurse to working with physically and sexually abused children because the ER was too demanding of her body.

She came to Dr. Galvin because she was stalled at 160 and her Lupus flares were getting worse. Her new job with the kids kept her late at work and the only appointment she could keep was 5:30 PM. Our office closed at 5:00 PM but I volunteered to stay later so that I could relay instructions from Dr. Galvin.

Something magical happened. Put me in a crowd of people and I freeze. Place me in a position to perform or speak in front of people and I freeze. I spent my life avoiding social interaction and as a result, I very accurately read people's emotions.

As Alisha and I talked, and she recognized it too. After a month, Alisha’s Lupus flares were completely gone. She was doing CrossFit and losing weight again.

She was doing so well that Dr. Galvin started to trust me a little more and allowed me to meet with some of his other patients. I earned the title Health &amp; Wellness Advocate and those patients also did very well.

I kept up with my Systems Administrator duties, so I just decided to do the marketing materials. Multiple times, Dr. Galvin walked in on me still at the office past 12AM. I worked so hard that my family began to accuse the Galvins of taking advantage of me (they weren’t).

I got my license back

I plateaued for about a month, slowly worked my way up to jogging 5 miles (8 km) a day, egg whites

It took a crazy amount of discipline, and it will forever blow my mind that I was strong enough to change my lifestyle and ultimately transform into an athletic babe at optimal health in under a year.

So

I take the issue of offering help with weight loss pretty seriously

I don't know where to start with my story

I was alone

I had thoughts of suicide since I was 10 or so. I was an overweight kid from the age of 8 + and that fact did not go unnoticed by plenty of people. At any sign of something negative in my life the words

As the years went on the words would flash more often and even in times when I should have been happy. I then started a new flash of words in my head

I was always blessed with some great friends though so I was able to find happiness in my life with that. Until one day I received a job offer in WA

This brings us back to climbing the stairs. I was living in WA for 6+ months and the rainy season couldn't have been helping. I no longer could bring my self to shut out the constant drum in my head that I should just kill my self. 

I had decided to use a wider rope so my neck wouldn't snap

Every step was harder than the last. I was trying to look for an excuse to not do it and was coming up short. I made it half way up the steps and dropped to my knees. I knew if I went any further

That was it

Maybe it takes being to that point, I would constantly cheat on eating food, or workouts. You must lose your pride and face hard truths.

I also realized

I would constantly find articles about how the human body would process food or how adrenaline boosts metabolism for hours. I found articles on why we are addicted to food. It was no longer information that some asshole was trying to sell me in a book or diet. 

I armed my self with data. I only trusted papers with valid sources and within 6 months I had done something I didn't think possible

The reason I decided to post here in loseit is their faq has a real solid mentality that I respect highly. Control that diet and exercise. 

Friends ask me for advice and I always start with 2 things. Don't eat like an American and change your life style.

Don't eat like an American: 

I hate diets. I hate the term diet. It is drawn too parallel with the idea of a temporary thing. If you change the way you eat forever

I spent some time in Japan and Australia(worst plane rides ever when fat). Every time I would come back

I was able to think on a time when I ate less and still felt just as full. Even now people will state that I eat like a bird

The even bigger part about the not eating like an American

http://youtu.be/dBnniua6-oM


Change your life style:

I spent multiple years in the gym. I would work out for 1-2 hours a day at the start of this. I have found, I walk up those bitches 2 at a time. I take every opportunity I have to get up and do something. If you are hoping to be different, you need to be different.(sounds lame but true!)

Me now:

It has been 4+ years since obese me died. I rarely weigh in as I don't find it as helpful, this will probably be for the rest of my life. I can promise you this though, even if you talk to me now on one of my worst days, it is still one of the best days of my life.

I spent most of last year just doing your standard keto diet without any exercise, who has been having me doing all sorts of different types of exercises. I'm thinking of starting back up on a lifting program (probably Starting Strength) for Saturday, Tuesday, and Thursday, in addition to doing cardio on Monday and Friday and seeing my trainer on Wednesday, but I'm not sure yet. I'd like to try to start building up some muscle because I know I'm going to have to deal with a lot of loose skin (which I'm already starting to have some problems with) when I get to where I want to be.

When I went to the doctor two weeks ago, but kept getting discouraged or busy with school work and working. Now that I'm graduated from college, working and ready to finally get all of this weight off. I just turned 23 and there's no time like right now. I'm sick of my weight. This ends here.

It took a lot of building myself up to walk into the gym. Looking back, I've always had a false idea that I was significantly smaller than I am. My recent realization has really kicked me into going.

I walked into the gym and the guy at the counter was so friendly. He helped me get started and offered me a killer deal on signing up. He showed me the equipment, maybe working out with a workout buddy. It was cool.

Actually working out was a little difficult. I did a mile on the elliptical and 15 minutes/5 miles on the bike, it's a difference. It feels really good to be this sore.

I'm signing up for The Color Run in October

I'm really excited though and proud of myself. I just wanted to share my story because I feel really good. And if anyone reading this is nervous about going to the gym

**Backstory**

A lot of info is in the album, calling off of work, and being a grade A asshole to my friends. Luckily for me, they were better people than I was at the time and no matter how much I frustrated them, they never left. As I neared the 270lb mark, I considered suicide and decided it would be better to be dead, fat, fat, however, but she was definitely the one who hit it. It was at this point I decided to change everything about my life. I enrolled in Cyber school to finish the credits I needed

*TL;DR* I'm a 20 year old, lost 30lbs, realized how much of a bitch my Ex was and stopped over December. In January I started back up and have lost 55lbs since, making it 85lbs total.

**How I did it**

* The first months of my weight loss were strictly done by eating less calories. I used the LoseIt app on my phone and simply counted everything I ate, height, gender, and how much you want to lose. It might be hard at first to keep track every day. I struggled at first to count everything because ""one little cookie won't matter,"" but when you do really get into it and track every little thing, you'll be amazed at how quickly the weight comes off. Seriously. I lost 30 pounds in 5 months by just eating less, you CAN do this.

* The second round of weight loss (starting in January) I found it difficult to lose the amount of weight I wanted simply by watching calories. I began researching what the best way was. I came to the decision that I'd try some HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) in the form of the Insanity work out. This, and a little weight lifting (squats mostly) helped me lose another 30 pounds in three months. After that I hit a bit of a plateau. I searched everywhere to figure out how to get over it and pretty much found that there is no fool proof way to get past one. I happened upon a post on r/keto at this point and decided to loosely try some of the users suggestions out. What worked for me was skipping breakfast and waiting until after 1 pm to eat lunch, having only water until then. Some people don't think this works for weight loss, but I'm telling you for me it got me out of the slump. I've been using it since May (not religiously but pretty consistently) and I've been able to lose around 1-2 pounds each week. However, you still have to keep in mind those calories. One thing that also worked for me was lowering the amount I could have per day once the weight started to come off more slowly. (I wouldn't suggest going below 1500 though.)

**Things I've learned**

* If you are at all considering losing weight, but I've realized that I actually wanted to do it to know the feeling of self peace. I can finally look at myself and not get pissed off at the fact that I hate the person looking back. 

* This brings me to my next thought, trust me, I've been there, but even in a depressed state, they are still glad as hell to have you, even if they don't say it. Without the love and support of my few close friends, I may not even be here to write this.

* Lastly I want to say that no matter how heavy you are, myself being one. I understand that being overweight isn't healthy, but you have to make sure your mind is heathy before you can begin to work on the rest of your health.

For those of you who read this, but are depressed like I was, PM me. No one should have to go through depression alone, and I'll have your back.

I'm here to share my weight loss journey so far! I'm surprised I have the courage to do this. :D

**Background:**
I've been overweight for most of my life. I remember looking at baby pictures from when I was little and getting extrememly mad at my mom for allowing her 6 year old to be overweight. I was never considered ""skinny"" during my whole entire life. Even though I was overweight I was always an athlete, my diet had always been poor due to the fact I was raised by my Italian grandma (mom worked a lot) who loved to feed her grandchildren :P SO MUCH PASTA NOM NOM NOM. So that's where my poor diet began as a kid and continued on until I decided I needed to get healthy. 

**What caused me to change my lifestyle?**
The constant hatred I had for myself. I couldn't look into mirrors without feeling disgusted by my appearance. It's honestly a shame that a 12 year old began to have body image problems. I had little to no confidence. 

So here are some **before pictures:**

**200 Pounds:** 5'4

(Ending up losing a lot more than anticipated so the dress ended up being a little loose at the top :D)

Side View: (I was making a scary face
http://imgur.com/O6ISh

**Diet:**
In the beginning (around June) I started slow. I slowly cut out junk food and processed food. I began to eat whole grains and lots of fruits and vegetables. The only problem was that I was still eating too much of all of this so a few months later (about December) is when I began to cut down portion size and count calories. My diet as of today consists of lots of vegetables, healthy fats, lots of fish, and some grains. I follow a more paleo type lifestyle so I typically don't eat many carbs, unless I feel like my body needs more carbs. 


**Exercise:**
As I said in the beginning I was an athlete so I started out at a higher fitness level than most overweight people. I began to run 20 minutes everyday for most of summer. I realized that was not going to cut it so I got a gym membership in November and that's when I really began to see results. A typical workout for me today includes a 45 minute run 5x a week and strength training about 3-4x a week. 

If you have any more in-depth questions to ask about my diet/exercise/anything

I'm strength training now to gain more muscle and get a more ""toned"" appearance.

Anywho, I do not even remember what it feels like. It is all ""new"" to me. 

Thanks for listening to me ramble. It has not been easy and people who say the surgery is an opt-out it is not, but I WILL get down to 250. Then set a new goal. 

EDIT: The surgery was Gastric Bypass surgery. I had to lose 50 on my own before they would operate and even then at the size i was they were worried. I had an amazing surgeon named Dr. Whoglemouth (sp) and he works out of Sentera Heart Hospital in Norfolk, even though they suck it out, does not all escape. If you have back pain before the surgery you will wake up in pain, but they will give you liquid painkillers and a button to ease it. Any pain i had was gone in hours. I stayed 3 days in the hospital. I was up and doing laps the same day they operated.

If anyone has any more questions i will edit this part again. This first edit was at an opts request. I think this meets the criteria now.

I too have recently completed an endeavor. I used to be 300 pounds, once i saw how out of shape I was I started working out to get better at hockey. Things kind of snowballed and I Started working out regularly. I loved feeling the way I did and it was improving my game. I fell off my diet and working out for months at a time which is why it took me so long to lose the weight I did. But i was not in a rush. I was always completely content with myself. I always had a girlfriend, confidence, great family, what more could you ask for. Well I've gone from a XXL shirt to a M and a 46-48 Waist to a 36. I was 225 2 months ago and was going through a bad breakup. I decided to do the Insanity workout. I followed it to a T. I did exactly as it said for 60 days besides eating it's EXACT meals. I ate extremely healthy and lean and worked out everyday. Nothing was more important to me than my workout. I lost 30 pounds because of my dedication alone and shaped my body tremendously. 

I'm still going to workout a few times a week and continue to play on a few hockey teams but for now i'm content. 

For anyone looking for inspiration. Stop reading this. Get up. and just do it. Go for it. Dedicate yourself

Here's (http://imgur.com/QYF4k) a GIF comparison of me 42lbs/20kg heavier and as I am today, I have no fat roll behind my head, my face is less round, my gut is smaller, and hopefully the fat in my organs (especially in my pancreas... causing diabetes) is going down.

**Victories**

* 84lbs/37kg total lost

* I reversed my fatty liver disease. Now cured.

* Asthma is much better.

* I can jog on a treadmill for a few minutes at a time. I feel like Chuck Norris!

* A few people have mentioned I've lost weight. It's starting to show.

* I fit into my old (volunteer) coast guard uniform today which used to be very tight


I'll try to find the pic of me at my heaviest and make a comparison GIF to show the true difference.

Thanks for all the inspiration. Time for this lurker to give some back

Edited for formatting and a typo.

**EDIT**
Wow

Height: 6'1""/185cm.
Starting weight: 366lbs/166.6kg (BMI: 48)
Current weight: 281.6lbs/128kg (BMI: 37) - lost about 80lbs/37kg
Goal weight: 187lbs/85kg (BMI: 25) - still need to lose about 100lbs/43kg

**Motivation:**

* Reverse my type 2 diabetes

* Be fit and able. It might sound funny

* Look good

* Find Miss Right and make her Mrs Right

* Be healthy enough to start and raise a healthy family (after the previous step).


**Method:**

* If I fall off the ""wagon""

* Ketogenic diet - meal replacement shakes 3x per day, no sugar. Want to start drinking tea (hibiscus, etc.) I'm currently on an experimental diet (the 600 calorie one in the Diabetalogica scientific journal) for another 6 weeks. 

* Exercise: not doing much currently because of the very low calorie diet. Otherwise

* Support: an awesome doctor. I'm in the driver's seat - he just helps steer sometimes

* Motivation: use music

* Focus on moving forward, I'll get there. When doesn't matter.

**Future plans**

* Finish my 600 calorie/day diet in 6 weeks

* Finish 100 push ups program

* Re-enrol in Krav Maga class I couldn't complete because I was too unfit.

* Move to a rural area. Build a vegetable garden. Eat WAY more vegetables. Make them a way of life so I never get this way again

* Have a family. I will not let myself get this way again if others depend on me.

* Limit ""cheat"" food to lunch and dinner on Sundays with family and friends.


My best secret at the moment is that little chant inside my mind to accept the hunger pains as a good thing: ""I'm burning away my diabetes"". I imagine the fat inside my pancreas and other parts of my body melting away. What was a bad pain before is now a good pain.

At the end of 2009 I decided that I would stop playing World of Warcraft and get back in shape. I decided this all because I hated putting on my socks. It had become something that I had to work up the energy to do.
 I came to reddit and found some motivation on /r/fitness and loseit and started my journey. I quickly dropped about 60 lbs in the first year by doing heavy cardio. The next 30 or so in the following 6 months by just counting calories and playing sports. The last 6 months I have been floating around the 200 mark and couldn't be happier.

I had gastric bypass 5/16/11. Prior to surgery I had to lose 50lbs in order to have a healthy and safe surgery bringing my surgery weight to about 296-ish. It fluctuated between 292-298 the week before while on the liquid diet.

My surgery was a complete lifestyle change and I am forever grateful for it. I am 9lbs from my surgeons goal and about 13lbs from my goal of 146lbs

I run 20-25miles a week now and I'm at the gym 3-4 days a week strength training. My future goals include a HM

In 2008, physically and mentally.  I knew it was never going to get any better.  Then all of a sudden, I feel off.  Something was wrong and it got bad enough that I finally went to the doctor.  

I was worried about what was wrong with me then I realized I had to go step on the scales.  I went into a full blown panic

Right then it was like switch inside my head was flipped, just an infection, took some antibiotics and I was fine.  

The first year I had no idea what to do.  I grabbed my iPod and walked on the treadmill

I started eating better that year

I kept working harder and and went diving in October.  I had a little bit of weight and was fighting to stay up.  I never had done that, I was down to about 210 pounds when I started it.  

I probably hadn't been under 200lbs since elementary school I'm guessing.  I worked and worked and worked and one day I stepped on the scale and it said 198.4lbs.  I'm not an emotional person

I figured that summer I'd go ahead and go to my reunion.  I walked in and it was one of the greatest moments.  I saw a friend of mine

I wish I had some secret to share that would help, don't stretch before you workout.  

What I do know though is that as someone who hated to run

Doing all the things all of you recommend! Add vegetables, and treat my body with respect. I am a work in progress, and will continue to be a work in progress - to stop working on myself, is when the problems really start.

**The details or who/what/how:**
I'm a 6'3"" 36 year old male.  
Started off at 425lbs but I've been 370+ for 11 years or more prior.  
My goal is currently weight goal is 210 (prior to loose skin removal.)  
  

I've been working out since the start of December 2010. Dieting since February of 2011. Exercise is done daily

**Some NSV's I've experienced since my last update:**  

* I walked from my front door
* I'm down from a 5XL shirt to wearing a Large. I'm not sure I'll ever fit into a medium but I certainly don't mind.   
* My stretch waisted size 54 pants have been replaced by size 36 pants.  
* Restaurant booths and wicker chairs still concern me momentarily but my brain is finally starting to reprogram itself.

So I'm nearing my end goal. Any advice from those that have lost a lot and successfully transitioned to a reasonable diet without regaining? Honestly the closer I get the more I worry that I'll just regain a huge chunk if I don't keep eating the way I am now. I'm not likely going to be anorexic or anything but having lived this diet and gained so much by losing so much..I don't want to slide even an inch backwards. Advice would be great.

**EDIT 2 **

Some information:

My names Daniel

I started my weight loss journey in mid/late September after ending a toxic relationship. I cut out all unhealthy foods (sugars, fast food) and replaced it with healthy food. I track everything on MFP (www.myfitnesspal.com) now and in the last 6 months I have lost over 50 pounds.

I eat anywhere from 1400-1800 calories per day, turkey etc), complex / slow digesting carbohydrates, and healthy fats (natural peanut butter, egg yolks, avocado).

In the first 4 months of my transition.. It was entirely done with nutrition. I completely changed my lifestyle and the weight started falling off.

In January I started working out at the gym on top (4-5 times a week).. Doing a basic split and about 20 mins of cardio per workout.

After working out and eating healthy at the gym for nearly 2 months

I decided to start intermittent fasting, 182'ish.

Exactly 1 year ago i made a decision to lose weight. 

I'd been in denial about my size, and my friend's funeral. I was bad, my body was bad...times were bad.

[Here's me at my heaviest](http://imgur.com/HMPZb) For obvious reasons

Anyway, took advice from a friend who runs a sports nutrition company, and got to it.

I ate properly, and ran. I did all of these things to the point of failure, and came back the next day to better the results.

Unfortunately, but once i was OK'd by the doc, i got back out running and shifted a bit more.

[Ambulance](http://imgur.com/RDpQZ) - [The result :(](http://imgur.com/cF2Hs)

For a long while, and watched the weight come off. Things were great. When my body weight decreased, so did the rapid loss. I would check myself every day, and would be constantly demotivated by my weight remaing the same for days at a time. I began to eat less and less, and my calorie intake got to something akin to 600 calories per day. I was starving. I would eventually binge, and then i'd see +1lb on the scale and i would be in bits, and begin to eat less again.

Someone on LoseIt had faced a similar problem and recommended MyFitnessPal. I stuck it on my phone, one month later i'd lost 10lbs.

It's scary

[Well

My next goal is 13st, and apart from the muffin top, i'm pleased with my new appearance.

* Starting weight: 23st 3lb / 323lb

The weight loss portion of the plan worked well for us. But it's a diet. And diets never worked long term for us. What was different about this plan was we got a free health coach who supported us with a phone call each week. Our coach led us through a book and workbook (called the Habits of Health) that really helped us identify the habits in our life that were leading to disease and obesity.
 
It took about 4.5 months for me to lose 50 pounds and 7 months for my wife to lose 100 pounds. (Results will vary. Typical weight loss is 2-5 lbs for the first two weeks and 1-2 lbs per week thereafter.) http://imgur.com/rhmQmgm

We have been maintaining a healthy weight for almost 2 years now. We knew if we wanted a change in our lives we needed to CHANGE our lifestyle. The plan taught us exactly how to have good nutrition

Wow, it's extremely simple. 

Basically during my high school career I was heavily involved in Cinematic activities (I went to an art school), before I'd go to school I would eat Muesli, which is just rolled oats, dried fruit, nuts, and some yogurt mixed together. I would have about a cup and a half of this for breakfast. Not sure how many calories but probably a decent amount considering the ingredients in it, but nonetheless healthy and didn't get you hungry for a while. For lunch, and I would STOP when I got full, other than riding my bike around leisurely around my neighborhood for maybe 30 minutes. The hardest thing was not snacking at night. I've always been one to come home and pop in a movie and start the snacking craze. It was very hard to adjust

*""I began dieting and exercising last week and started couch-to-5k for the first time ever but I gained weight this week! What am I doing wrong?""*

Usually the community answers focus on their caloric intake

When most people decide to lose

Here are the two reasons why:

**Reason One:**
 
Somebody taking up a new strength-training program usually experiences a phenomenon called DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. This soreness is caused by a variety of factors but primarily is the result of microscopic tears in your muscle tissue caused by your work-out. These tears attract inflammation to the area to help protect and heal the muscle fibers. This process requires extra water. So your body will retain water as necessary until the muscles are repaired. This can result in a 3-4 lb weight gain

**Reason Two:**

As somebody starts an aerobic exercise program, and more exercise means they need more of it.

For each gram of additional glycogen stored in the muscles, and thus your water retention.

What's great about this is the more glycogen you store

What's not awesome about this is that you're almost guaranteed to see the number on the scale go up when you start a new workout routine due to the water retention caused by DOMS and glycogen storage.

**The Takeaway:**

* If you start a diet and workout regime at the same time
* This doesn't mean dramatic transformations aren't happening under your skin. This is one of the reasons it's great to track measurements in addition to weight.
* This water retention phenomenon usually lasts 2-3 weeks while your muscles get accustomed to the new routine.
* If psychologically, and add in exercise later. Or add in your exercise program *extremely gently* to minimize the impact to your muscles.
* Eating low-carb/keto is one way to 'cheat' this initial gain because low-carb forces your body to flush water from other systems which balances out your muscular water retention. But the phenomenon is still happening under the covers.

*Note: all science in this write-up is hyper-simplified for the sake of quick explanation.",,t5_2rz8w,1374766793.0,,25lbs,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1j14kz/why_starting_a_new_exercise_program_is_going_to/

First off, and the scale said 420. I think that is the reason I'm still at it. Because I realized then that something was wrong.

After I went to the Chiropractor

I went to the store and rented Dance Central 2. Never in my life have I had so much fun working out. After I rented it

I also emailed Harmonix and told them about my weight loss and how I plan to use their game for exercise, and they're currently in the process of mailing me a package in the mail with Dance Central 1 included. Seriously guys, Harmonix is now one of my favorite gaming companies.

Anyways

Since playing that



I also made and account on MyFitnessPal

I also started a YouTube channel

It's also a great way to communicate and show my progress to other people like me

My new YouTube account can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/DeflatingWhale)

Any support on there is GREATLY appreciated!

Anyways


So I started off like so:

Weight: 420

Chest: 62""

Waist: 66""

Upper Arm: 19.5""

Thigh: 33.5""

Calf: 22""

Neck: 19""


and I am currently at this:

Weight: 402

Chest: 61""

Waist: 63""

Upper Arm: 19""

Thigh: 31""

Calf: 21.75""

Neck:18.5""

I took some before and after shots for you guys, but really I find that the biggest difference I'm noticing is my stomach becoming more flabby rather than hard (not that is was that hard before).

I'm here now to encourage you to get off the cardio bandwagon (especially you ladies) and really incorporate strength training and compound lifts into your routine. I originally ran / did cardio 5 days out of the week until I fell in love with the way my body took to strength training. I'm on my way to my very first NPC bikini competition on June 29th--something I thought I could NEVER in my lifetime do.

**How I Did It:**
If you'd like something a bit more detailed

Basically: I ate 1450 calories a day for 110 days. 140 g of which were protein. I never once cheated, yogurt, ground turkey, chicken, quinoa, sweet potatoes, whey protein powder, protein bars, ground beef, and carrots.

I worked out 6 days a week. For the first two months it was purely cardio. After Thanksgiving (Day 62) I started compound lifting with only 1-2 days of cardio. I absolutely love powerlifting. I can explain this more in depth if there is interest


Once I stopped cutting on January 10th of this year

I pay for my plan from my coach and trainer, and then follow that up with accessory work. 

In short: I eat clean, brown rice, brussel sprouts, oats, and peanutbutter :P) I'm less than 17 weeks out from the San Jose Fit Expo, and so I begin my competition prep really soon.

Some detail to appease the moderation: M/22/5'11''. Starting weight was 285 in May of 2012. I achieved my weight loss primarily dieting but also exercise. I started out with very strict calorie counting and abandoned all fast food and soda. I still do not eat fast food but do enjoy soda from time to time. I do not count calories anymore as I have found I can subconsciously control portions. Biggest advice for anyone trying to lose weight is to realize that the only person responsible for your weight and appearance is yourself. Some people don't like the blatant truth

I believe that if there's something in this world that you find worth fighting for

Through my entire journey from 340 to 161 pounds, that ""aid"" in weight loss. There were a couple of main methods I tried when losing weight. I tried a variety of diets and lifestyles in the past two years with varying success. All my methods had a few things in common. I drank lots of water; having between two to four liters each day. I also supplemented fish-oil and a multivitamin on a daily basis. The only supplements that I use on a near daily basis are organic vitamins/minerals, fish oils, and whey protein.

When I first started, and over a period of 6-months, I lost 40 pounds. During this time, I was also set on limiting my caloric intake and eating six small meals. In January of 2011, my brother introduced me to the Paleo Diet. In the process, I began eating food high in saturated fat, protein, I began weight training for the first time. Toward the end of 2011, I was unsure if I would ever get under 200. 

From August 2012 onward, and an intermittent fasting protocol that is specific to LeanGains via Martin Berkhan. All the methods I've tried have had their merits, but that one alone has helped me break past my plateau, gain strength, and lose body fat beyond I ever thought possible. Along with intermittent fasting and strength training, I'm a firm practitioner of macronutrient cycling. I cycle between high-carb/low-fat meals on my training days, and high-fat/low-carb meals on my rest days while keeping protein high at +1g/+1lb of body weight on both days.

Usually I don't post on Sundays because I get the lowest amount of readers on Sundays.  But I've noticed a trend going around on Facebook


[This image was taken from the Reddit front page today.](http://imgur.com/McVM4v2)


I'm sure some of you have seen images like this around


The disturbing this is that so many people (women especially) don't find anything wrong with this.  They say


Shaming is a big part of what keeps an eating disorder running.  If you say


Would you let your daughter use this for inspiration if she was a bit chubby?  No?  Then why is it okay for you?  What kind of message are you sending to your children?  That it's okay to hate yourself


I really hope I'm getting my point across.  You do not need this for inspiration in any way shape or form.  Great inspiration comes from two sources.  1.Yourself.  When you love yourself and what you can accomplish, and have a happy attitude you're going to see her as an inspiration.


It's not easy relating to the model in the picture above.  In fact a good part of her could be photoshopped.  She might not have any idea what it's like to battle binge eating disorder


When I have a bad day there are several things I do to remind me of where I've been and what I can accomplish.  One really great way to get inspiration is to look for people who are like you, and is a runner.  She put in the hard work and has such grace. Who better to be an inspiration?  Or how about [Holly at 300 Pounds down.](http://www.300poundsdown.com)  She has lost over 217lbs and battles with a sugar addiction.

Just reading her blog you know that she has been through rough patches to get where she has.


Talk about inspiration!  These women have lived the tough life.  Most who lose weight have battled an eating disorder of one kind or another.  They work hard every damn day to lead a happy and healthy life.  Now I ask again

I have been a bigger girl since I was in middle school. I was a military brat so moving about every year or two was normal. For that reason and because I've always been a shy reserved person it was hard for me to make friends. I kept to myself and books and Twix cookie bars were my only solace. 

This trend continued on until I was about 20, but did I change anything? NO. I just became more miserable and more aware of how overweight I was. 

Fast forward to about 4 months ago. I was 257 lbs, but after a breakup I decided that enough was ENOUGH. I was tired of feeling fat, and letting my fatness keep me from doing the things I wanted.

I started out with a calorie goal of 1500 a day with and 3 times a week forced myself to the gym to do 30 minutes on the elliptical. Since then I've cut my calories to 1400 daily and upped my time at the gym from 30 min to 50 min and the weight has been steadily coming off.

Proof:[link]http://i.imgur.com/Pm5bi.jpg[/link] I'm on the right

Needless to say, refusing to hang out with friends, not living life).

One video game I was always fascinated with was Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). It is a game with four arrows on a big metal pad. You watch the screen and step on the arrow when it hits the top of the screen. It has many different settings for beginners to master experts.

To me it was a game that people did to make fools of themselves OR to look ridiculously talented at the arcade. I would have never wanted to step foot on it

I was hooked. It was a challenge

Fast forward to Christmas (three years ago) and my parents got my twin and I the DDR game for the Wii as well as a dance pad. We took turns all night playing it

It wasn't until a year ago that I heard I was going to get a chance to go visit Ireland. (This was in July 2010). So I decided right then and there I was NOT going to be the stereotypical American in Ireland. I had 10 months to get into shape (I was 202lbs and I wanted to get to at least 125) and I was going to do whatever it took to get there in a healthy way.

I started research on eating right

My Wii DDR game had an exercise mode that calculated the calories you burned. For my first day I tried to burn at least 400. It was tough but I made it happen.

EVERY DAY I added 10 more calories to burn. So day 2 was 410 calories. Day 3 was 420. In all that was ONLY adding one extra song every day.

I also had to work on food intake. Embarrassingly my nutrition usually consisted of an entire box of macaroni and cheese, candy, doughnuts, chocolate. I never ever felt hungry and I wasn't comfortable unless I was full. So my diet was something I would have to change.

I discovered that some vegetables have negative calories

I then looked up things for my height. I am 5'2 and my healthy body weight should be between 110lbs and 125. I then looked up calorie counters and discovered the amount of calories I should eat in a day. I was probably eating around 4000 or more a day

So I came up with this table and I stuck to it.

Month 1: 350-400 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day. ~1400-1600 per day.

Month 2: 340-390 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day. ~1360-1560 per day.

Month 3: 330-380 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day ~1320-1520 per day.

Month 4: 320-370 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day ~1280-1480 per day.

Every month I would take off 10 calories per meal. I dropped 10 pounds my first month

I did my DDR every day and I made sure to watch what I ate. I was soon so good at knowing how many calories were in what that I could go out to eat and just KNOW how many calories were in each spoonful.

I recently joined an outdoor obstacle course fitness facility. The owner promised me that if I followed his advice and trained with him, skeptical, but I joined. 

Three weeks in I have been working my ass off like this:


Mon: CrossFit style work out (with a HIGHLY trained coach who has background in physical therapy and strength and conditioning)

Wednesday: My LEAST fave day

Friday: Obstacle course day!! I LOVE this workout. Not only is it FUN, Over/under logs, 6, 8, and 15 foot walls, horizontal rope, balance beam, monkey bars

[The pictures](http://imgur.com/a/RYyXN)

I am really nervous to post pictures. So

I have a long way to go

One thing that I realized was how mindlessly I was eating before. There would be pizza and I wouldn't be starving, I will occasionally have a treat, but it's because I really want it. I budgeted my calories this week to have birthday cake today and not feel guilty! 

Honestly

The other thing that I've learned is how to love myself in this process. I don't do this for ""future me"" and because I hate how I am anymore. I do this because I love myself and I want to treat my body better. Just because you're not to your ""after"" doesn't mean you should feel shame. This attitude has made a huge difference for me. Remember

These are just my experiences so far. They have all come as ""ah-ha"" moments that have really shaped how I feel. I know I have a long way to go

r/loseit is a HUGE inspiration for me. You guys are amazing people and I love seeing your stories. I hope mine will one day be helpful to someone else as well.

I just started counting calories yesterday and had a real eye-opening experience just now. Before preparing my standard breakfast (a veggie omelet, I decided to put everything into my [SparkPeople](http://www.sparkpeople.com) nutrition counter and was shocked at what I saw. I had been consuming over 1000 calories in JUST ONE MEAL! Ugh. 

But it was a beautiful thing. I was able to look at where I was spending those calories and where I could cut back. No EVOO

I just finished my new breakfast with reasonable portions and I'm just as satisfied

My advice (and I know this isn't a new concept)

I feel like a lot of people start dieting by throwing out every starch in their house and stocking up on carrots and celery. That’s great!...if you like carrots and celery. If not, so I thought I'd share some of my favourite low cal foods:

a.	**Pickles** – pickles have a ton of flavour and are under 5 calories each. They’re pretty salty

b.	**Turkey bacon** – I actually prefer the taste of turkey bacon and it’s only 70 calories for two pieces. 

c.	**Berries**– much less sugar than other fruits and they make an easy snack

d.	**Salsa**– I put it on chicken, anything really.

e.	**Light cream cheese**– I spread it on crackers

f.	**Pellegrino** (or any sparkling water) – I get really bored of just drinking water

g.	**Skim milk lattes** – I don’t usually have an appetite in the morning

h.	**Balsamic vinegar**– really low in calories but flavourful. I use it to marinate chicken or pour over a caprese salad

i.	**Eggs** – I don’t even worry about removing the yolk or anything. A poached egg on a piece of whole wheat toast with a slice of turkey bacon and some raspberries leaves me full for several hours. 

j.	**Salmon**– tastes great with just a squeeze of lemon and has a ton of protein

Edit: I'm currently away from my computer and on my phone so when I get home ill answer all your questions

Edit 2: I didn't realize this thread was going to blow up. Thanks everyone for the wonderful comments!

How I did it:
In the beginning I decided to limit my intake to 1200, and ultimately shot for 100g or above. I started in November of last year, and added in lifting weights in January, every other day.

Here's an example of what I do on my lifting days:

**Arm day:**

* Bench press
* Lat pull down
* upright barbell row
* shrugs
* curls with ez bar 
* 3 sets of 10 push ups 
* assisted pull ups
* Bent leg raises (3 sets of 20)

**Leg day:**

* Squats or Deadlifts (Alternating days)
* Leg extension machine
* Leg curls
* calf raises
* Leg press machine

**Main every day staples of my diet:**

* Eggs (with yolks)
* tuna
* bacon
* Chicken
* Turkey
* Nuts (about a handful a day as they're calorie dense)
* Veggies (Broccoli, cauliflower, celery, lettuce, spinach, carrots)

I've recently added running as I did an Obstacle Race (30+ obstacles, so if I skip out on running, that's okay.

An example of food on a typical day:

**Breakfast:**

Skipped (I'm usually not hungry. Skipping breakfast doesn't affect your metabolism
If I DO eat breakfast

**Lunch:**

* 1 serving of tuna with 2 tablespoons of mayo, 1/4 chopped onion, salt, and pepper to taste. (Pro tip: Before you add the mayo, add in everything else. The flavors of the salt, pepper and veggies will get a chance to soak into the tuna and make it more flavorful)
* 1/2 cucumber-sliced (I put the tun on the cucumber slices. This is my favorite lunch)
* 200g greek yogurt with a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder

**Dinner:**

* 4-5oz steak
* Steamed veggies

**Dessert:**

* Breyers carb smart icecream (It tastes exactly the same as regular ice cream. It's just sweetened with splenda. 90 cals per 1/2 cup

26 years old

On left is August 2008, I would walk on my treadmill three miles a day, on an incline. I gradually increased the incline. I also lifted weights randomly through the week; no special routines, just went to a friend's house and did whatever he was doing.

Before I knew it, and still have problems running to this day. So, I bought a stationary bike... and that is when I had this stroke of genius:

[You can play video games all day long and lose weight doing it.](http://i.imgur.com/Go4w9.jpg) My brother and some of my friends also do this now. They tell me it was a stroke of genius, and with the bike, started dropping weight like crazy. My dad also got me a rowing machine as a Xmas gift, and I added that to the mix.

1349360942.0,10xqel,"250 to 178.  Found an old photo that made me go ""whoa""",moosethumbs,849,142,88,"6'0""

I've been meaning to make one of these posts for a long time because /r/loseit helped me so much

So I was always fat.  Early last year I was 250 lbs, or not.""  So I decided that I would not be fat any more.  One quote that really helped me focus was ""The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.  The second best time is now.""  

When I first started I was probably eating north of 3000 cals a day.  Here's a day that wasn't super common but definitely not unusual for me before I started losing: Breakfast: Cracker Barrel chicken fried chicken, fried apples, grits, hashbrowns, few bites of pancakes the kids didn't eat. Lunch: Five Guys double cheeseburger, most of the fries.  Snack: Cookies.  Dinner: 15+ buffalo wings, most of a large potato wedges.  Dessert: Large Blizzard.

Now that wasn't every day of course but on like a weekend day where we were out a lot it was not at all unusual to eat out every meal.  I can almost guarantee that very day happened at some point.  Just looking at that list makes me queasy now... geeze...

So anyway, just generally pissed off.  After a while I got used to that, started learning just how many calories really are in things, and moved my goals down to 2000 cals, then 1800 cals.  I started by changing the kinds of things I ate, then eventually cutting out snacks altogether, then cutting out sides like fries when I ate out.  I weighed in twice a day, and kept a chart right next to my sink.  It really helped me understand how my body worked and also kept everything in perspective.  I tried hard not to think about how much I had to lose and focused on every small loss as a win.

I went from 250-220 in like 3 or 4 months and then kind of got depressed and gave up.  Thanksgiving time I started back up again, basically.  By May I was 192, and on June 3 I weighed in at 183.9 marking the first time probably ever that I was a normal BMI.  That was my ultimate goal, to be able to say I'm not medically fat any more.  I'm normal.  I've hovered around there ever since, and right now I'm 178.  

Now I eat so completely differently than I used to.  I still eat out more than I should but I opt for the ""healthier"" things, and one of my biggest personal victories is that through that I didn't give up and turn back to food for comfort.  

So that's pretty much that.  I cut calories.  I changed what I ate and how I ate.  I ran some.  I read /r/loseit all the time for help and inspiration.  I did the occasional bodyweight exercises.  Pull ups I like a lot,,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,True

I'd love to get your honest opinions as to what my finishing weight goal should be. I don't want to become skinny, regardless of my size .**I'm just wondering if you all wonderful people could guide me with your thoughts of how much more I should lose. I'm thinking somewhere in the 15-20 pound range? I just realllly don't want to end up overdoing it in some weird body-image problem.** I'm not going by a BMI calculator- I find that method flawed in so many ways and I refuse to follow it. 


As for my continued regimen- I've been taking lots of vitamins, I have been able to strengthen my core and my stamina. He sent me a 10 pound kettlebell and a jump rope, along with some other really sweet goodies. I enjoy using the two both very much and it's helped immensely. (He works for a wonderful health  company called **Onnit**. Not advertising, but just giving credit where it's due!

In terms of food, a hard boiled egg, or a cliff bar. This keeps me full throughout my difficult physically exhausting shifts at work and I usually eat a protein filled dinner. I enjoy grilled chicken a lot, and I've come up with a recipe that is absolutely freaking delicious and it very easy, and healthy!**So I grill chicken ahead of time, and that way I can cut it up and put a couple pieces in a bag and have that as a great, protein filled snack.** 

I've cut down on carbs a lot, like quinoa and barley. I love making lentils, too, and those are great for you, really move your system along, and are EXTREMELY filling!

Back story first, I wanna say junior year (so that was 2000-2001). I was active during this time, I would roller blade a lot.  But I would just go more up senior year then after high school. I would work at a movie theater for 6 years, so getting money and eating free food all day, I would balloon and eventually pass the 300 mark. Looking at old pictures would kinda depress me, worst feeling was one time I went to six flags and tried to go on a roller coaster but wouldn't be let on due to me being too big.

Anyways, oh I would do a few things here and there like make turkey burgers, but im sure I made up for it in other ways.
I used to always eat hot pockets, lean cuisines, pizza, candy and many other things.
Also I was around 320 pounds
So January 27th, whats the worse that could happen? And I only thought about it the night before! So I weighed myself, and I would weigh myself everyday from here on out! The first day it said 319 lbs. So I knew from the get go I would try to only drink water, no more soda, iced tea, juices or any of that! Also I would eat something with dinner I rarely had.....vegetables!
Also exercise, even if it was only a spurt for a few seconds.
After a few days I would start doing my route that I still do to this day. 3.5 miles. Also for breakfast I would only eat oatmeal or bran flakes. Lunch would be 2 pieces of whole wheat stone ground bread

First week I lost 13 pounds
Feb 10th I would be 300 pounds, that would be cool, just not o be at the end of the sizes in the stores.

Now I realize what I ate was probably under 1, but it worked.
March 30th
Now I would move to a number goal that I thought of, just a walk. Also I was lucky this winter it didn't really snow, but then again that didn't stop me this winter (more on that later). My next goal in my head would be 219 since that was 100 pounds. I would see the doctor for a physical, he said he would like to see me at 180, which I agreed with, cause I thought to myself if I reach 200 might as well go under!

I wouldn't treat myself this whole time
June 1st I would be 199 pounds. 5 months and somehow the first number of my weight went from 3 to 1. Now I was more running, obv with some little walking breaks.
last 0.5 mile would be just a cool down walk
July 8th
5 months
But would I just settle on that? Nope.
And I finally did treat myself again
I have only drank water
Exercise still, my fastest time I have done it is 38 minutes, usually around 40 minutes.
And I run outside all the time, hell wind chill in the single digits weather! Even with snow on the ground! I do it no matter what usually. (well unless its down pouring all day).

I would keep on going down (albeit slower now since I wasn't meaning to) and now have been around 165 for the past few months
Ill have a slice of cheese with my sandwich, honey nut cheerios) I eat more fruit now even.
Now some may say I lost it too quick, someone saw me, EARLY ON and said I looked sick lol. I feel great though. Of course though I must show a picture! I took the after ones today!

I started my health-kick in June (a few months after my before pics were taken). I wasn't too unhappy with my size, I was introduced to the TRX (www.trxtraining.com) for strength cross-training. I tried it once, and I was hooked. I've never had such a difficult workout! So I managed to buy a TRX on sale (thankfully, as they are pricey), and a door anchor so I could work out from home (this meant no excuses not to do it). I began by working out (30-40 mins) every 2 days, and now I probably exercise between 5-7 days per week. As the exercise increased and improved, so did my diet. I find that once I get into an exercise routine, and I have also been consciously focusing on not snacking too much. (I cave every so often, and vegetable/fruit intake has greatly increased.

I don't want to discourage anyone from losing weight

My story? In short: Without realising, but I won't go into detail here. It's taken a long time to get close to recovery, and I won't say I'm there yet. In learning how to eat properly again (something I'm still doing), I realised that ED thoughts are just a level up from the diet mentality. 

I began to wonder, body image, weight, exercise, etc. Who else is just rationalising these thoughts as acceptable because they're overweight?

A lot of the time

I don't want to classify people as having ED. I don't want to make any huge stances or proclamations about the way people should lose weight. I just want to remind everyone to check in with the way that they're feeling. Let's recognise that and continue to burn

Weight loss shouldn't be miserable. It should't take over your thoughts. You should be celebrating your milestones, but it shouldn't be a constant cycle.

You can say there's a multitude of reasons for it;  food addiction, depression... take your pick.  Bottom line though, I've struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember.

I turned 38 in july of 2012 and I realized that at my weight (561) I wasnt going to live much longer the way I was going.  Since I was planning on asking my fiance to marry me

Thanks to the good folks over at /r/keto I've found a diet that is compatible with all of my issues and actually works for me.  Best part is

I had my last one late Monday night. I've limited myself to one strongly caffeinated cup of tea in the morning and the rest of the time

I passed out yesterday after class. Woke up with the shakes. Later that night I had the worst stomach pains ever experienced and then the worst diarrhea I've had in a long time.

I've been using the Sleep Cycle app for the past 13 days. The peaks are when Im awake. If I wake up I make a note of the time to check the apps accuracy and it works surprisingly well.

Here is what my average night looks like:

Here is how my sleep pattern was last night

The giant peak in that one was because I started it two hours before I actually went to bed so it got me walking around the house and what not.

Anyways- I started off at 220lbs in the fall. Monday I was 198 and today Im 196. Most of the weight loss is due to switching antidepressants.

Now if only I could get rid of this headache...

Edit 2: because people are asking-I'm female

Antidepressants are not a cure all. It can be helpful but won't do shit if you perpetuate negative thought patterns. For some, it's a long term thing.

My experience has been like a truck getting stuck in mud. CBT would spin the wheels of the truck but it was the meds that gave me the strong push to gain traction.

Today is my 24th birthday. The past year has been a pretty crazy one for me. Since I started living healthier in January, and found a form of exercise that I truly enjoy.

If you had told me a year ago that I had done all of this, and I tried eating healthier, and again failed miserably.

But this time was different. Not only was I in the right mindset to do all of these things

I've read a lot of success stories where people had a certain ""breaking point"", I didn't really have such a breaking point (at least, not that I can recall). I had already resolved to eat better once I moved out of my parents' place, as I would be able to control what I bought at the grocery store, but it wasn't until I read Ben Davis' blog that something in my head just clicked. And so I decided that on Monday, January 23 I would start living healthier and like Ben would update my progress on a blog, as accountability in my opinion is a big factor in weight loss.

One of my goals when I started my blog was to get to 220 lbs by my 24th birthday. As of this morning I weighed 221.6 lbs. While I did not reach my goal

And for those who are curious how I did it... I started with Weight Watchers but two months ago switched over to MyFitnessPal. I also have a fairly active job so that helped with the steady weight loss. I started exercising regularly in February but didn't start running until late July. My starting weight was 273 lbs

So I decided to lose weight in December 2011. At 155cm, usually two. I wasn't super strict with keto. I found I was still comfortably in ketosis while eating about 25-30g net carbs a day. I usually ate some berries and nuts, and drank a fair bit of full cream milk. I also drank, but just made sure to get a vodka and diet coke. 

From January to August 2012

While abroad, considering I spent most of my time in Germany, I only put 2.5kg back on. 

When I came back, but considering each shift is up to six hours of running around hauling slabs and buckets of ice up and down stairs would go a fair way to keeping my exercise up. 

I have PCOS, I've also only ever viewed it in 5kg increments. I have no deadline; I'll reach my goal weight when I reach it.

------------------------------------------------


Wow, but to be fair I did set the bar extremely high for myself, so I'm proud of how much I've accomplished. I told myself that no matter how much progress I made, I would post my progress after one year, so here I am. 



In July of 2011, but I just didn't know how much. After growing some balls, I weighed myself and almost had a heart attack - I was around 285 pounds. This would be acceptable if I was 7 feet tall, but unfortunately I am only 6'0, so I had to accept the fact that I was morbidly obese. That was a wake up call for me, I started my lifestyle change immediately. There were no ""Oh okay, let me have gorge myself today, as there were in the past. I was in so much shock and disgust at how much I had let myself go that it was easy. I could make excuses to why I became morbidly obese



I immediately started counting calories (MyFitnessPal made this easy), worked myself down to 2,000 and eventually 1,750. I just recently started a split where I eat 2,200 on workout days and 1,800 on rest days (3 workout days, 4 rest days). As far as workout goes, do cardio in the afternoon, and Shoulders/Legs on Friday. 


I'm now down to 170 pounds, because my ultimate goal is single digit body fat. I don't want to get to get to single digit body fat and look scrawny, due to not having a large amount of muscle mass. So I think I'm going to slowly bulk to about 185, and then lose 20-25 pounds slowly, to end up looking better than I would with the amount of muscle I have now. Either way, it sure as hell beats how I looked before, I'll admit that much. 



I don't really know what else to write. I guess if anyone has any questions or comments, or have already begun your lifestyle change (Honestly, it's a lifestyle change, NOT a diet. I promise you won't go back to the way you were before), I have to tell you.. It is **COMPLETELY** worth it. Honestly, I can't tell you how much better my life is now that I've lost this weight. I look and feel a million times better than I did before. Literally every single aspect of my life has improved, without a doubt. I know it's extremely hard at times - I won't lie to you and say it's easy - but hell .. it's worth every single drop of sweat


I also want to thank everyone on this subreddit. I don't really ever post here (mostly because by the time I log in and type up a comment, but I lurk a lot, and I can say this subreddit and /r/progresspics are both very motivational and extremely helpful. 


Cheers :)

We have always been really happy relationship-wise and when I am happy I eat. He is also an amazing cook so we would eat amazing food all the time.

I'm Justin and I'm in DFW.  I started back in mid-April 2012 and I'm down 113 lbs so far.  My starting point was 498; I'm currently at 385 and my goal (at present) is ~220... that may change when I get to that point

I think the best advice I could give someone who's starting to seriously change their life is:  mistakes happen.  Don't compound it by not getting back up and dusting yourself off.  I fall off the wagon fairly regularly, dust off and chase the wagon down so you can get back on.  

I had a Weight Watchers leader once (long ago) who told me two things that have stayed with me.

#1- ""If you were holding a dozen eggs,' and drop the rest, would you?""

#2- ""A stick of butter weighs 1/4lb... every pound you loose is 4 sticks of butter.""  Take a second and think about that... When I have a poor showing on the scale

**And if you're interested about my story:**

You know, doing nothing else. I used to spend about 8hours average a day playing computer, and on weekends I sat even longer, dwelling into the night and sleeping long on the mornings.

And that's not only it, no exercise with alot of bad stuff. I also rarely ate 'real food', just this junk infront of the computer. It all got to the point where I could feel my heart bumping a few extra times and I got signs of diabetes. 

One day I just lost it. I got so damn depressed and started thinking suicidal and those things. 'Why am I such a looser' etc etc. Then I came to my senses

So I ran. I ran. Everyday I went out to run. 1km went into 3km. 3km went into 5km and soon I was able to run 10 kilometers. I felt alive.

After 16 weeks I'd gone down from 96kg to 80kg, and I can finally manage to do things without being lazy. I've stopped drinking coke, which have saved me a lot of money.

Even if my weight loss wasnt as spectacular as some other people in this subreddit I feel I made a major change in my life. Stopping eating unhealthy stuff and focusing on real food my life has gotten so much better, and girls ;) (Which can be very hard for people with no experience)

I would like to give a message to all people who are thinking about loosing weight, be a new person. I know a lot of people may be saying this, but it's true. It will surely hurt, but it's always worth it in the end.

EDIT: I am 19 years old and 187 cm.

**The best tip I can give to other gamers losing weight;**

When you feel hungry

EDIT2: **My eating guidelines**

* No soda
* 3 meals a day - breakfast
* Prioritize protein before carbohydrates (try to get full on the fish and not the mashed potatoes
* I watch the portions I eat and I make sure not to eat more than I actually need
* If I get hungry - I'd drink water and play games. (May be hard at work/school but I try to get focused on something else than the hunger) 
* If the above doesn't work

EDIT3: Wow

In my very last edit that im going to do here I just want to say this: Remember, it's just that exercising makes it so much easier. Some like running, some like biking and some like walking. You just have to find what suits you best.

**About Me:**I grew up always the bigger kid. In High School I was 6'3"" and always used my height as an excuse to explain my weight. I was lying to myself daily. From 2004 to 2008 I played a ridiculous amount of video games. I normally spent about 12-16 hours per day playing World of Warcraft or other games. The addiction grew as I started college. I hit my final height of 6'6"" and just kept gaming away eating anything and everything from whole pizzas and bags of chips to sometimes two 2 liters of soda in a night.

**Breaking Point:**In July 2010 I lost my grandfather to a long fight of poor health due to complications with diabetes. It was a shock to the system as my parents always warned me about diabetes but this time it really hit home.
I bought a scale that didn't read ""error"" and I had ballooned to **375lb**

**How I Lost it:**My mom bought me a gym membership as a way to motivate me to lose weight in August 2010. The gym was open 24 hours a day

Another big change I made was my diet. I never actually counted calories, and I started eating dinner with my mom at home rather than ordering fast food or pizza.


The weight started to come off slowly. I saw it first in my face and then in the rest of my body. Every week I took a progress picture. It just gave me more and more encouragement to keep going. Clothes were starting to fit again

Accountability was a great motivator to keep me at the gym. My mom was there to make sure I kept on track, friends and other weight-loss bloggers keep up with me daily. It keeps my mind focused on my goals knowing that people read about what I do on a daily basis.

Then I found a new love in my life that I never thought would happen: running! Running is my favorite workout; I could go out and hit the pavement and leave all worries at home. I joined the Kent State Running Club at school. I ran a 5K and then a 10K

Over this past year I joined the University of Maryland Terps Triathlon team

I am sharing this all with you to hopefully help inspire and to tell everyone to never give up on your dreams

Lowest Weight: **235lb** I gained about 10lb in muscle training for the race. A total Loss of about 140lb from August 2010 until April 2012


Weight Today: **245lb**

**edit: thought I would answer a few questions I got** Things that have changed noticeably since the weight loss other than my body:

1) I fit in chairs (movie theaters

2) Love Life

3) Confidence (see #2)

4) I'm now a certified firefighter/EMT in MD

5) My major has changed in school from Computers to Kineseology and trying to help others. The biggest part is I love being around people now where as before I wanted to be a loner and hide from the world.

6) I'm considerably colder in the Winter now and can't just sport the shorts and t-shirt thing. My hands and feet in particular.

7) I still game a little bit as old habits die hard. Add me on xbox live: Uzi507

I posted a little over a month ago with some of my progress shots from the beginning of my diet. I am 20 years old, and my start weight was 230. I'm now at 190. I've got my goal weight set at 160, but I may stop before then. I began my diet last December. 

**You guys were all so supportive and wonderful to me

Here's another quick little autobio: 

I began losing weight when I saw a photo of myself and was utterly disgusted at how I looked. I've been battling terrible depression and anxiety since the beginning of my adolescence. I grew up in an abusive home with terrifying parents. **When I began taking anti depressants, and my weight ballooned.** 

Ever since

I've always been very physical, and was training to be a junior olympic archer. (I'm also a putz, and hurt my legs in sports and then broke both my wrists, so no more archery.. womp womp.) I just couldn't lose the weight. I have a love for cooking and for soda.. that made everything very difficult. **I'm also a very emotional eater.. when I'm depressed or whatever, I binge to make myself feel better.**


Last August, this has helped me because I was suicidal when I was arround them. 

So

I limited myself to only one serving of foods

**In terms of exercise, and I love to hike. Because in the chesticle department, I am well endowed, I can't run. It's painful as hell. I do a lot of core work- push ups, situps, squats, small free weights. I desperately want a gym membership, so I make do with using cans of soup as weights along with other things I find around my apartment.**

As a young kid I was always very active
I'm not sure why it happened
Through middle and high school I was frequently picked on by my peers for my weight. Even more disheartening was that as I grew towards adulthood my close friends didn't seem to respect me the way they did my fellow peers. 

I feel that a lot of the perceived slights are projections of my own insecurities
About 10 months ago I decided I needed a change. 
I'd quick smoking on January 10

On August 2
My commute was 2.5 miles downhill to work. For anyone familiar with bikes
At my heaviest I weighed 320lbs. 

I now weigh 184-188 depending on time of day and how much water I consume. 
I'm not adjusted to being a normal size but I LOVE looking at myself in full length mirrors. 
I want to let anyone who is struggling with weight know that your weight is not a battle
It's a part of who you are. 

When I stick to an 1800 calorie diet filled with fruits and veggies and lean meats and egg whites and nuts and cottage cheese and brown rice (my main foods) I'm *not* sacrificing.

**I did not count calories or use any specific diet method. 
For me losing weight is about changing one's life from passive to active.**

Thanks for the congrats and support reddit! 

@Mattmouth &amp; MommaJo: Do it! When I started I hated running

Whatever physical activity makes your endorphines will be your best friend. If you mix in body weight &amp; resistance training your gains will be much greater! Muscle size affects metabolism in a big way. More muscle = more energy burned at rest = less restrictive diet &amp; more energy!

**EDIT 6:35PM**

I truly didn't realize how important sharing my success could be! Thanks to everyone for the karma and kind words!

I've gotten quite a few message asking for exercise and diet details. I'm planning on replying to each and every message

Details:
I find time to do some activity literally every day. Even on the two days I was sick this winter I went for some walks in our fine Portland rain. This **doesn't** mean I work out every day. I've adjusted my mental approach to exercise

From August through October I rode my bike 6-12 miles per day and did some basic weight training with dumbells and body weight resistance. I changed my approach to food

From November through February I was living further from work

I now live and work in a different location, low fat, low carb will always be successful* Lunch is a whole grains and veggies and meat. Dinner is more of the same. I eat lots of snacks, generally almonds or low sugar granola bars.

I am hoping my post will be inspirational/encouraging/motivating/ialsolovetoseebeforeandafterpics for some of you.


My story:
I have been losing weight for over a year. It all started with a competition at the office to see who could lose the most weight. The two top ""losers"" received $100 each and the first team of ""losers"" received a free vacation day. Holla! It was so much fun to be able to see what people were going to do to lose weight. The beginning of the competition I was at 240 and by the time it was over I was 215. The competition lasted for 3 months. I did not start off by going on a strict diet. I changed what I ate. I watched closely on what I was putting in my mouth. I stopped eating out so much(which saved me a lot of money) and started cooking more and eating more veggies and fruits and less chocolate(i love chocolate!) I ended up being the second ""biggest loser"" and my team came in first place with ""losing"" It was such a great experience! I recommend a competition for anyone who works with a bunch of people who are trying to lose weight. 


Afterwards, potatoes, bread etc. I only eat in moderation (of course).

Losing weight has been a struggle and it has of course been rewarding. I have never been one to be outgoing and confident. But since my weight loss I have noticed myself doing things I normal would not have done (like going to a water park) and standing up for myself in situations I normally wouldn’t have. I have also found it harder to ""give up"" on something that I have started (such as going back to school.if i can lose weight I can finish some courses) I am a more determined person and more of a go getter.

Wall of text:
I never thought I was really overweight in high school. At 5'8'' I weighed between 160-165 for most of high school. I danced regularly and was generally active. I went to college and of course packed on the freshman pounds... Found myself around 185 when I graduated. Following a messy breakup at the end of college coupled with a job I worked around the clock I had become sedentary so here comes August of 2011 and I'm 23 years old and close to 200 lbs. I got a new job and moved to Boston, its 80% diet, its so simple. So I begrudgingly start entering things on MFP and what do you know... I LOST WEIGHT! 

For the last 8 months I have tried to keep my calories around 1200/day, strength conditioning, zumba, and step classes to a point where I work out in some form about 8 hours a week. I have come to LOVE the gym because my classes are just downright fun and while I initially planned to get to 165 again, once I hit it I decided to keep on trucking. I went from a size 12 in high school, to a size 14 at my worst, to current... I am a size 4! YEP a 4!!! So I have hit my goal and would like to work on fitness goals and lose about 10 more (I'm fighting with that stubborn stomach fat!) and the best part is everything in my life is better. My boyfriend and I are as happy and strong as we have ever been

When i first started this journey I was your normal WoW addicted nerd. I would eat a Hot and Ready pizza in one sitting etc.. Then my place of employment installed a small gym with a couple treadmills and an elliptical and a decent amount of free weights.

Finally one day I had enough.. Everyday I worked I would go to the gym for lunch and get 45 minutes of elliptical in and I would stick to eating around 1200 cal's a day. nothing special just oatmeal and chicken some other things but tried to keep a routine. 6 months later and I was down close to 100 pounds. 
right now I just keep my food consistent try and get good amount of protein and just listen to my body. I play Indoor soccer

Its still a struggle everyday I am not going to lie I have issues with controlling my food intake but I work on it day by day.

The long story for those who are curious or like to read:

The before picture was taken roughly a year ago

I started eating better and while I saw some results

Unfortunately I have a bad joint that prevents me from running without excruciating pain (I'm being seen for that) but I can walk just fine. And walking is easy, I live in Florida so this means I can walk year around if I don't mind putting up with some heat in the summer.

So I started going to a local park near my house that has a path about a mile long. I started walking two laps 3-4 times a week. It would take me 20-25 minutes per mile. Eventually I increased the frequency of my visits

My weight started coming off at about 1-2 pounds a week, I no longer snore at night and my blood pressure is textbook perfect.

Since I am at the same park every day

The common thread I noticed is that a lot of the homeless people simply want to be acknowledged and treated like fellow human beings. So many people walk by them as if they were invisible. The other day this homeless man ended our conversation with ""thank you so much for talking to me"" and it broke my heart.

I am now looking at volunteer opportunities so that I can do something to help even if it is only in some small way.

Walking and meeting new people is now one of my favorite things to do  and it has shown me that each and everyone of us is fighting some kind of battle.

**TL;DR** I lost 75 lbs walking and we should all be nicer to each other.


**EDIT -** Thank you everyone for the kind words! It's up to each of us to make a difference not just in our lives but in the lives of others. Whether you volunteer, you are making the world a little bit better, and just like our weight loss, it adds up to a lot over time.

**EDIT 2 -** Thanks again, listen to your body, talk to a doctor, and if given the all clear go walk! That is all it takes. You will burn a similar amount of calories as running, the trade-off is that it takes longer. And yes, a lot of you have guessed where I walk.  I'm there every day for a couple of hours so if you see me, please stop and say hello! Also, my time is very limited between work,,80lbs

I watched my weight grow steadily for the past 7 years (~210 to 300). In September of last year

When I got home, found /r/loseit and started with the FAQ.  I filled up my disused water pitcher and emptied out the 6 2 liters of regular coke in my fridge.  I started counting calories with my fitness pal, but quickly went to keeping a mental log.  My original goal was 50 pounds, with a stretch of 75 pounds by the wedding (September 2012).

My primary mode of exercise was walking to and from work (4 miles round-trip) every day.  On weekends, both ways) to the bakery to get it.  I kept to a roughly 1200-1500 calorie diet.  Most of my cheat days were spent in the bar drinking hard liquor instead of beer.

Various non-scale victories:
- People do a double take when they look at my license when checking my id.
- I no longer have to worry about fitting into booths at restaurants.  (I actually had to move once because my gut just wouldn't fit.)
- I'm no longer confused with another overweight (former) co-worker.
- I used to consume 1000 calories to ""recharge"" after exerting myself physically.  Now I just have a glass of water.
- Clothes fit.
- The energy.
 
I'm currently at 189.2 pounds with a new goal of 175 pounds.  I know I should start lifting weights

Edit: Thanks for all the nice words and advice.  A guy couldn't ask for a nicer group of strangers on the internet.

**My story:**

My family have always had terrible eating habits (fatty food and lots of them) and were never very physically active. I was a fat baby, plus a big can of spaghetti and meatballs, with about a third of a block of cheese on top. I would eat that in addition to breakfast, dinner and snacks… crazy. We ate a fair bit of KFC and stuff like that; everything was upsized and full-fat. I always hated the way I looked and knew I was huge, but honestly thought I was too far gone to do anything about it. Needing to lose so much weight just to be in the healthy weight range seemed pretty hopeless and I had pretty much resigned myself to being fat forever.      

When I moved out of home into my own place

Over the next two years I made sure it kept going down, it worked well even though I was paying less attention to my weight. I ended up at 187.2lb / 84.9kg on New Year’s Day this year, when I made a resolution to get down to 143.3lb / 65kg.    

This year, since I want to clear my plate, have dessert and generally eat stuff that tastes good. I’ve been experimenting with intermittent fasting, drinking more water and eating more protein-rich foods and it seems to be working. I’m also enjoying finding ‘skinny’ versions of recipes to try out. I definitely give myself a day or weekend off every now and again, but I find that even then, I don’t go too crazy in terms of portion size or the kinds of foods I choose, so that’s positive. My partner and I also both now eat gluten-free as we’re intolerant, especially when eating out.    

I started the Couch to 5K program about two months ago and, Day 2. I’m super proud that I’m not only giving this a go, but sticking to it … I nearly died trying to finish Week 1, Day 1 and totally failed it, so it’s a testament to the program that I can now run 20 minutes without stopping. I’d also like to get into some bodyweight and dumbbell exercises – not sure where to start though. If anyone has suggestions, I’m all ears. Something structured like the C25K program (starts off easy) would work really well for me, if anyone knows of anything like that.    

**FAQ:**     

*What foods have been life changing?* Definitely vegetables. I never ate them much before and didn’t know how ridiculously tasty they could be even when cooked healthily. Also


*Do you have loose skin/stretch marks?* Yeah, thighs and butt are all a bit droopy in terms of skin but I’m hoping as I build muscle and time goes by that they’ll firm up a bit.


**In summary:**


I guess the point of me writing all this out is to hopefully help someone else who might think they’re ‘too far gone’ to realise that it’s so not true. I love looking at progress photos and reading people’s stories here and it’s definitely helped me along the way this year … hopefully this does the same for you. I’m under no illusions that I’m thin or pretty, and I’m committed to achieving my goals, which is really exciting and motivates me each day. It also makes it a lot easier to get back on the horse when I fall off occasionally. I definitely reward myself (non-food rewards!) when I hit goals … for example, I just got a second little tattoo as my prize for hitting the 50kg loss. Surrounding yourself with people who will cheer you on is also critical … my partner is so encouraging and supportive, which is amazing. My family are superficially supportive (“You look great!”) but follow that up with piling unhealthy food on my plate even when I’ve specifically asked for small amounts, pooh-poohing things like the gluten-free diet and Stevia, and saying things like “Don’t get too skinny!” when I’m clearly still so far away from that. 


My ultimate goal is to get to 143.3lb / 65kg by the time my partner and I move to London for 12 months in November this year … and then maintain it while we’re away.

I finally hit my goal weight last week so I thought I would post my progress pictures. This is how far keto has taken me with no exercise. I am now going to start toning up and try building some muscle. I am still doing keto and don't think I will ever stop.  I love the lifestyle and never thought I would ever have this much energy.

Now the rant: They don't really want to know, move more.  Pay attention to what you're putting in your mouth.  It all *sounds* good, but many people seem incredibly resistant to putting it into practice.

My wife has started ""using"" MFP.  I use that term loosely

My buddy called me and asked how I managed my first, I never ate seconds, I switched from beer to club soda, and I walked 27 holes of golf every week.  ""Well, you know, *wife* does the cooking, so I eat what she serves, so I like a few beers to unwind at the end of the day

A neighbor mentioned that he saw me coming in from my runs every morning as he was getting his paper.  He'd like to run, I laced up my shoes, went out my front door, and started running.  ""Oh I can't do that, I couldn't even run a mile.  I've got bad knees.""

Summarizing a spate of recent posts to r/loseit: ""How do you guys lose weight? I'm married/in school and I have a kid/job with weird hours/gig playing mouth harp in a klezmer band.  I have to eat fast food for my job, I barely have time to watch 2 hours of tv/play 2 hours of video games/spend 6 hours on reddit.  I'd like to get healthy, but I just don't have the time!""

Here's the bottom line folks:

1) There are no points for good intentions.  The only cheating in weight loss is cheating yourself.  Not logging the calories doesn't make them go away.  Yes it's hard. No

2) Of course you have reasons for doing what you're doing right now. We all have reasons for everything we do.  But there is no situation where nothing changes except your weight.  You change first

3) If you want to do what we do, there is no easy way, there is just ""the way"".

4) If you don't want to change anything about your life, you don't need a different you.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this, and that even when I am I'll have to continue to work to maintain it.  I'm getting a little miffed at the folks that don't want to do any of the things it takes to get in shape, so they keep giving reasons why they can't and asking for ways to lose weight without doing anything, like I'm holding out.  Like if they ask me enough times I'm going to say ""Yeah I was just shitting you with all that diet and exercise stuff. Here's the magic word, say it three times tonight before you go to bed and in the morning you'll have lost 20 pounds.""

I inherited [Osteogenesis Imperfecta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta) from my mother; it is a genetic disease that affects bone metabolism, I was discouraged from participating in contact sports by physicians and became weary of being very active after having suffered so many breaks. Nevertheless I was a happy child, and found healthy enrichment in music and drama, and not-so-healthy comfort in food.

I learned to be more careful, and it has never seemed to dim the careers of exceptionally gifted singers. I was confident in my musicianship and paid no regard to my physical health, beyond avoiding fractures.

[Spring 2009](http://i.imgur.com/WjIpV)

I began my graduate studies in the fall of 2009, and more so my weight. I began to have doubts about my future, which were compounded by a growing unhappiness regarding the quality of the work with my voice teacher at the time. 

By the spring of 2010, to my career goals; and I was taking out loans to do so. On top of that, I weighed in at around 250lbs at a height of 5’9”. At the end of the semester I had my final vocal examinations for the year, known as Juries. They were a disaster. I was in a terrible place emotionally, and had no confidence in my waning technique; I received the lowest marks I’d ever been assigned in my musical studies, ever. I was defeated and didn’t know where to turn.

I knew that if I wanted to ever reach my goals, and is [often not easy to end for either party](http://www.claudiafriedlander.com/the-liberated-voice/2012/06/possessive-teachers.html); I didn’t know where I would go, but I knew I had to start moving.

And move I did; the date is clear in my mind: May 11

Early in the morning


I read that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) was an effective means of weight loss, but I owned a great pair of Brooks running shoes. For reasons which also seemed unknown to me, I owned a pair of running shorts that fit and had an iPod armband.


So I ran; all 250-odd pounds of me. I *sprinted*, and felt horrible pain in my legs. So I read more. I learned that maybe I was being a little too zealous with my exercise, after I had given myself a few days rest, I transitioned to the [Couch-to-5k program.](http://www.c25k.com/)


I spent the summer working as an Area Director for [Johnsonburg Presbyterian Center](http://www.campjburg.org/), walking, wrangling children, swimming, singing, praying, and not eating a carb. By the end of that summer I had lost 48 pounds, and rediscovered my happiness.

[Fall 2010](http://i.imgur.com/EXz9p)

My journey continued. I [revised my diet](http://examine.com/leangains-faq/) as I reached different short term goals.  I began [running further](http://www.njtrailseries.com/) and [lifting weights](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki). And just as importantly

As far as numbers go, I weighed in at my lowest weight of 138.7.


[Here I am at 148](http://i.imgur.com/xvQ8m)

So how does one make changes to their life? 

There are always the general lessons or wisdoms I followed: *It’s never too late to change. Start with small

But there are a couple of other lessons I think have been instrumental in successful personal change.

* Making significant changes to your lifestyle will mean that you give some things up, healthier favorites. Your palate and preferences will adjust to new habits and you just may become even happier than before. 

* Don’t be too stubborn. Diet and exercise become a religion for some folks, exercise, and time management habits and make changes where you feel it would better suit your goals and progress. At the same time, there are diminishing returns to obsessive scrutiny over your routines.

* [Buy a food scale](http://amzn.com/B005OSUIYG) and [know how to cook](http://amzn.com/0764578650). Any changes you wish to make to your body whether fat loss or muscle gain

I've been following this /r/ for quite some while now but have never commented or posted. I've finally gotten the courage to share my progress! 
Since I was 12 I've struggled with my weight and had major body image issues. I was always unhappy with how I looked even if I would pretend that I didn't care at times. My highest weight was the summer after I finished the 10th grade. I was around 190 and so unhappy with myself.
I finally had enough so I started to eat healthier and I introduced myself to kickboxing and pilates.
I've had a slow but steady weightloss taking around 2 years (and counting)
I'm still not at my ultimate goal weight

The TLDR of how I did it:

* Cut out all the garbage food I knew I shouldn't be eating. That included fast food

* Replaced the above with complex carbohydrates

* Calculated my BMR/TDEE

* Introduced exercise into my life. Whether it's going on a walk a few times a week, sports, running.. Whatever it is.. Do anything.

* Took progress pictures. This was imperative and paramount to my success. **THIS ALLOWED ME TO SEE WHAT MY MIND WOULDN'T LET ME SEE

* Didn't give up when I fucked up. And I fucked up lots. It's okay to have a cheat meal or a cheat day and enjoy yourself from time to time. This has to be about a LONG TERM  and SUSTAINABLE lifestyle. This isn't a quick fix. Otherwise

* This is not about perfection. This is about changing your LIFESTYLE for the future for the better.

**Who am I:**  Female/35/5'6"" current weight=168.8 lbs (76 kilos), now wearing a US 12-14.  body fat = 28% (down from 33%) and   muscle = 36%.  BMI = 27 (down from 30).

**How did I get this way?**  I was always very muscular and fit growing up.  We ate okay in my family, dance, etc and I weighed in the 130s and was probably a US size 6.  I managed to avoid the freshman 15 after I entered college, but then I started dating my (now) husband and went on birth control pills.  I think when I graduated I was probably around 150 lbs and a US size 10.  Over the next six years, I put on right around 5 lbs a year.  These years were filled with tons of normal life transitions (getting married, buying a house, going to grad school) and although I knew I was getting bigger, lots of hiking and biking and gardening, even if it was ""healthier"" foods like goat cheese and whole wheat bread.  I weighed 180 lbs about ten years ago when I got pregnant for the first time.  I have spent the better part of the last decade having and raising children.  I lead an active life and eat well.  During this time, etc have always been very healthy.  I could run and play with my kids without feeling fatigued.  My husband has always been very loving and affectionate.  Add to this the fact that I have a very positive view of myself physically and I had *zero* motivation to take any additional steps to lose weight.

**Why did I decide to make a change?** In May of this year my weight was hovering in the 190lb-195lb range.  For my height, I would tighten up the eating habits and exercise a bit more until I got back into the 180s, but nothing really more than that.  This time was different.  My sister had visited for Memorial Day and she had also recently lost some weight and looked fabulous.  We are the same height and in pictures, it was just so awful.  She is probably in the 120-130 lb range.  I still see myself as that active, fit girl from college, but I lost her in a layer of fat.  I am done having kids, so no more thoughts about losing the weight just to put it right back on keeping me stagnant.  At that same time, I went out for a two mile walk.  When I got back in

**What have I been doing?**   A friend told my about myfitnesspal.com, just within my caloric allotment, which was 1680 kcal/daily.  It went fine, and I realized I had been eating probably 2500-300 calories more days then not.  I had to remember that I was no longer pregnant or nursing a newborn and I didn't need that many calories a day.  Since that time, I have been steadily shifting to a lower-carb, higher-protein ""diet"".  I try to keep carbs around 100g/day and not go over 150g.  The VAST majority of them are from veggies and fruit, and I have pretty much eliminated refined carbs.  I am trying to get my protein in the 125g range, I have not been actively tracking on MFP as a bit of an experiment.  I have worked out some really basic eating habits, and I needed to make something easier in my life.  For exercise, crunches

**What have I learned?**  I was healthy and happy before losing the weight.  I am MUCH healthier and happier now that I am getting smaller.  It is funny that it really took something ""shallow"" to motivate me (wanting to look better).  I now realize that wanting to look better is not shallow at all.  I love this subreddit and reading everyone's stories and seeing the pictures.  I am just about half-way to my goal and I know I can do this.  You can

I wanted to make enough money to pay my bills and continue living in my parent's basement in NJ forever. Then I bought a scale and realized the extent to which I had allowed myself to fall. One of the things about being massively overweight is that, happening over months and years.

Getting the scale lead me to look into low impact exercises I could do, but every teenager can't wait to ditch the bike and get a car. I wonder if things would have been any different if I hadn't. Anyway, here is a picture of me when I first got my bike, a tank of a thing from [Worksman Cycles](http://www.worksman.com/):

[At my worst

That was taken sometime in late February, who I met in the hall randomly outside the BYOC area. I remember being excited to have the picture taken and then very disappointed when I saw how awful it was. I really hope this next PAX East I'll be able to get that picture taken again somehow, but a lot closer to 200 than I will be to 500.

[Meeting Tycho at PAX East 2010](http://goatbert.com/images/JeffandTycho-PAXEast2010.jpeg)

On August 31st, I was wheeled into the operating room. The mortality rate for VSG is actually very low - much lower than I remember being told (it is apparently 0.1% at ""Centers of Excellence,"" which I think the hospital I went to was). Regardless, I was terrified of surgery - I had never had so much as an incision before. I wrote letters to all the people I cared about saying all the things I never said. Obviously, things went fine. Over the next 9 months I would go on to lose another 105 lbs. Here is a picture comparing me in May of 2010 to May of 2011, 105lbs down:

[Side By Side: May 2010 to May 2011](http://goatbert.com/images/LosingJeff-5-31-10-to-5-27-11.jpg)

It was a pretty incredible transformation.

In November of 2010, eventually getting to my (current) low of 372 lbs in November of last year. Then the holidays and winter happened. Holidays are a tough thing because it sends me right back into that enabling environment where the problems started. I love my family, and they would do anything to support me - except stop buying junk food. And I should certainly be able to resist the temptation. The problem for me is the temptation is coupled with an overwhelming feeling of inevitability - I start to feel like I'm just lying to myself and I'll never escape that fate, that I'll end up fat and alone in a basement in a nowhere town again.

So then I made my way (slowly) back up to where I was a few weeks ago, and lonely for 6+ years of it. No more.

So as of last Wednesday I joined a Crossfit gym - Monday, I'll be out on that bike. I want to beat my personal record for miles in a month (which I set last month, 92.6 miles). In fact, I don't just want to beat it - I want to destroy it. We'll see how I do. I've set some short term goals (410, which I hit this morning, now 399, then 375, etc. etc.) as well as a long term goal. As I write this, but whom I game with everyday. I want to walk up to them and see the look on their face as they try to figure out who the hell I am. In terms of actual numbers

As far as diet goes, oh I can have one cookie, one slice of pizza won't hurt me, that keto goes down the drain for me. I think the steps I am taking to constantly remind myself of my goals will help me avoid that this time. I've also been having great success with intermittent fasting - trying 16/8 or 20/4. I think it is easier for me because my hunger is already reduced as a result of the surgery. Non-fasting days I start with a 48g protein shake (ON Extreme Milk Chocolate Flavor) and a few supplements - iron-free multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, 2 teaspoons of Fish Oil. Sometimes I do eggs and bacon instead of the shake, and move the shake later. Lunch is usually cheese and deli meat rolled up, sour cream

I'm going to try to use reddit as the place I post updates and for community support. I have a blog, maybe others can find some inspiration from mine as well, and maybe the people here can help keep me accountable.

I had a gastric bypass on June 27th of this year, and I cannot be happier with the results so far. My goal weight is around 220-240lbs, so I'd have to lose another 150-ish to get there. At the rate things are going, it'll happen before the one-year mark rolls around, as I've not really even started on exercise routines. I've a friend from high school who is a personal trainer locally who's offered to give me a discount if I get some sessions with her, so I'm saving that for a bit further into the new year, but I've got the money set aside for that.

If I have one piece of advice to give people looking at this and thinking about getting a gastric bypass, it's not quick, it's not easy, it's not without risk, it's not easy, there's recovery time, it's not easy, it's NOT easy, and **IT'S. NOT. EASY.**

I can't:
* Eat until 30 minutes after I've taken my last sip of liquid
* drink until 30 minutes after I've taken my last bite of food
* eat more than half a cup of food in one sitting
* eat any kind of beef
* eat faster than taking one bite every 5-8 minutes
* eat fried potatoes of any kind
* drink anything carbonated

I have to:
* take a sip of water at least once every 5 minutes
* take 2 TUMS Ultra every day for the rest of my life
* take a chewable multi-vitamin every day for the rest of my life
* take an iron supplement every day for the rest of my life
* take a b complex vitamin every day for the rest of my life
* take a b-12 sublingual tablet every 2 weeks for the rest of my life

60 pounds down. 235 to 175.

I don't have a real set weight goal anymore. I just absolutely love working out. I used to hate it but now it's my favorite thing to do. I get bummed out if I can't go for whatever reason.

My advice to others: Make it something you love doing.

Edit because apparently it's not up to standards:

Diet: When I started, I never use flour or anything similar. I eat a lot of protein and only eat carbs in the form of a fruit or veggie.
It's okay to splurge every once in a while. There's this place that's close to me that serves a sloppy joe / mac and cheese pizza. I had a few slices of that last week and wouldn't ya know it
Workout: Run as as long as you can

**BACKGROUND:** Me and my (now) wife were never fat growing up. We were pretty skinny into our early to mid 20s and could pretty much eat whatever we want. Unfortunately age started to catch up to us and in our mid 20s we continued to eat terrible food

10 months later

**TIPS:** 

- Set a specific goal for yourself. Don't just say ""I want to be skinny"" or ""I want to lose some weight
- Track your calories. Weight loss is at least 80% diet so you need to keep track of exactly what you're eating. Use a site like [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) or [LoseIt](http://loseit.com/) to track EVERYTHING you eat. Don't just say to yourself ""I'm going to eat healthier!"" because you'll be surprised just how many calories some foods are

- Avoid cheat days for at least a month or two. This one may not apply to everyone but I'm going to put it out there anyways. I had tried unsuccessfully in the past to lose weight by eating healthier 6 days a week and then cheating on Sunday. The problem I found was that after a cheat day, which turned into me cheating on Wednesday... Try to go at least a month without cheating once and I assure you it will get easier to both maintain your plan and cheat without falling into a downward spiral.

- When you do cheat, creating a calorie deficit of about 600 to 800 calories, I was going over my limit by anywhere from 1000 to 1500 calories on my cheat days. I was basically erasing all the hard work I had done all week in a single day of cheating.

- Ease yourself into it. Don't try to do everything all at once as you will quickly burn out and give up. In my previous failed attempts to lose weight I always started off thinking I was going to completely change my life overnight. I would stop eating everything I enjoyed, still putting sugar and cream in my coffee and still eating things like rice and pasta. Over time as I lost weight, loseit.com would automatically adjust my calories. When this happened I was also forced to start cutting things out but I did it at a much more gradual pace. First I switched my coffee from 2 cream/2 sugar to only 2 milk. Then I stopped drinking the beer. Eventually I was down to about 1400 calories a day but I wasn't struggling to maintain it.

- Expect to be hungry for a little while but embrace the hunger. For the first 4 to 6 weeks, I just pictured the pounds falling off of me. It might seem stupid but it really helped me get through the first month, which I can assure you will be the toughest. Also, try to eat on a regular schedule. This will train your body to know when to expect food and help prevent you from getting hungry in between meals.


Something I learned having lost the weight is that it was a lot harder and took a lot more time to actually put it on. 10 months of a little discipline and hard work changed my life and if I can do it (a super lazy guy who loved fried fatty foods and sweets

Currently 203 lbs and 13.9% bf

First I would like to say thank you to this Sub for always providing motivation and stories about great progress. Keep it up everyone!

My story goes like this, I decided to do something about it. It started with the second picture above. I was at a new years party to ring in 2011 and a couple of days later the pictures were posted online. I could not believe how big I looked. I knew that something had to change. It took awhile to get started, but by the beginning of February, I was going strong.

I played football in high school, but had never stuck to a strict program. January 2011 I started a strict lifting program. However, after that first month I knew it would not be enough. I had to start doing cardio.

Cardio was not my friend at first

Next was Diet. After the initial 10 lbs I knew that I was still eating too much. I did a bunch of research online and came to the conclusion that the only thing I needed to focus on was eating less than my BMR, and currently I am doing paleo.

In the first semester I lost just over 40 lbs. That was just over 3 months. Since then I have slowly lost more and more. There have been times that I have gained weight

It has taken a long time but this has only proved to me that anything is possible with enough perseverance and effort. 

I started running distance when I was around 240

I still strength train 4-5 days a week and run every other day. My goals now are to finish my half marathon in November under 2:10 or under a 10min/mile pace

*thin but physically exhausted
*fat and unmotivated

Not a great tactic, and building meals around a vegetable/legume instead of simple carbs! This perspective completely refashioned my diet; as a vegetarian it's waaay too easy for me to overload on carbohydrates and dairy rather than protein and mono-saturated fats (lezbehonest, bread and cheese/tortillas and cheese/any carb with cheese= bomb).

I joined a gym, and I did ALL of it - which did nothing. I was essentially starving myself because the pills gave me no appetite which my body didn't like so I just sat in this weird 5-10 pound rage for about a year. 

Then I heard about a study at our local university - and I decided to sign up - essentially its a 16 week program where you have contact with 3 different types of doctors for different things - a nutritionist, want to lose weight, &amp; be able to attend 1 meeting a week.

So I qualified. And I went and they took all these measurements &amp; I filled out a questionare and all of this was just amazing and kind of motivating...but then

So that was hard, it was hard to show up to a room full of strangers &amp; discuss why we were all fat &amp; what our bad habits were - but as the meetings went on, I learned to love them. We learned all about positive thinking, and social triggers. We learned how to eat out smart, and how to say no! We learned that working out didn't have to mean pumping iron for hours on end - it could just mean adding 10 more minutes of walking in our day. 

**We basically learned that being healthy doesn't happen over night. There are no quick fixes. Your effort = your results.**

So I know that was long &amp; somewhat silly to read - but as simple as my class sounds - it changed my life. And if ANYONE has ANY questions or would like to learn about ANY of the things we learned - I would be happy to share with everyone!

Also, at the end of the 16 weeks a lot had good reports of lower blood pressure etc  - but I just still hope that someone hears me, get it under control when you are young, if you can! Tomorrow isn't always going to be the best time to start, now is!

My eating habits have changed so much
I eat clean now, and throw it over some greens....I've also learned that if you fail to prepare - prepare to fail. Literally. No groceries = crappy eating. You just HAVE to do it &amp; you HAVE to be wise. Shop AROUND the store - you don't need a damn thing in those aisles - except maybe coffee :) - just try it one time, you'll be surprised! Oh, and quit drinking soda. Just do it, those things really were holding me back!

As for my working out - I began small - 30 minutes of treadmill maybe - and now it is not uncommon for me to be at the gym for 1.5-2 hours - I love being there, one step at a time! 

I started at 188
And I now sit around 163-167 depending on what I've been up to the day before.

I'd like to drop another 25 pounds just to get my BMI to a zone I know my body needs to be as healthy as possible.

1353342299.0,13geqs,I finally got off my ass and did something...,irtehscarry,697,98,55,"So earlier this year I jumped on a scale to see how much I weighed. To my surprise the scale read 293. I was as close as I had ever been to 300. Quite scary actually. 

I completely changed my diet. I went from having a breakfast burrito for breakfast, dinner, and lots of soda &amp; snacks throughout the day. To having salads and much less fatty and sugary foods/snacks. I've also completely cut out all beer and liquor. 

I've dieted before

I've been playing softball once a week for a few years now. Running has always been my nemesis. It was hard to run to first without sucking wind like a fish out of water. My goal wasn't so much a set amount of pounds. My goal was to be able to run around the bases without feeling like I needed an oxygen tank at every base. 

After the first 20 pounds I felt better, and started using my dusty gym membership I'd been paying for for about 2 years (and hardly using). I went from needing to call a pinch runner, to being one of the people that gets called to pinch run. 

I've been steady at 226 for the past couple of weeks. The # isn't my goal. I feel better than I've felt in quite a long time. I weigh less than I have since probably just after high school (12 years ago)

I didn't take a before picture. But I did find a picture on my moms camera from Christmas 2011. I'm not sure how much I weighed in this picture. Given it was smack in the middle of the holiday season

My highest weight of around 160 was around when I graduated college ([http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#qO25PL9](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#qO25PL9)). Health was the farthest thing from my mind. I NEVER exercised, struggled to keep up in my classes, and I had awful anxiety, yet I told myself that spending all of my time studying would be the answer. I was only fooling myself...I had zero self confidence in any aspect of my life, and I used being fat as an excuse to be sad all the time and hide away from the world.


Blahhh sob story over! My formerly-obese sister came home from college and lost about 20 pounds to eating healthy and hot yoga. I found a studio and gave it a shot, but that post-yoga feeling, that relief after putting in 90 minutes of hard sweat, was magical. 


However

[http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#wBKpJOf](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#wBKpJOf)

I stepped it up a notch and started running three miles a day on top of the yoga. I felt great, so I figured, why not? And that’s what made all the difference. I was seriously limiting myself from my previous eating habits, so I had to make a conscious decision about everything I ate. 200 calories can leave you full and satisfied, or still hungry, your choice. It really helped me internalize that food is for fuel. “Calorie” is a unit of energy! Healthy eating made so much more sense once that clicked. Two months of that lead me here: [http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#rJzPgRf](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#rJzPgRf)


Then I got a job that uses free food to keep its employees happy, bagels, chips, pasta, energy drinks, DELICIOUSFOOD galore, but also a pretty extensive salad bar for lunch. Not trying to hate on free food or anything...and I guess I should thank them for giving my willpower such a great workout every day. I never really *enjoyed* vegetables, but I finally learned to separate my emotions from food. I stopped being so strict about my diet and indulged when I felt like it, in the big picture at least. Here’s the end of this phase: 
[http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#4mOi1rj](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#4mOi1rj)


Finally, VARIETY!) into my exercise regime. I even completed a round of Insanity, which completely restructured my body. My diet now focuses on clean eating and macronutrient ratios rather than calorie count. I try to eat mostly vegetables, sticking to natural, whole foods whenever possible, and I’m working to cut out sugar, wheat, and processed foods. I try to drink a gallon of water a day, but I recognize when cravings are emotional and when my body is telling me it needs energy.

Details: I am 5’9” (175cm) female and I started at 235lbs (106kg) in January this year. My current weight is 177lbs (80kg) I originally wanted to get down to 165lbs (75kg) but I have since decided that I would like to see what I look like at 147lbs (66.5kg) (because it is my favourite number and supposedly my ideal BMI)  and hopefully be able to maintain at 150-155lbs (68-70kg)

How I am doing it: I have cut down on carbs and have been counting calories with MFP (my username on there is Nueth if you would like to add me!) I started jogging and then found out about zombies
The one thing that has changed my life the most though is my fitbit. I love it

Problems: I switched scales about a month ago and my weight has consistently been 5lbs higher on the new scales (an aria that syncs with fitbit.com) compared to my old ones. 

What I suggest: Keep setting mini-goals! I aim to be able to wear shorts in August and not have my thighs rubbing, though I wish I had rewarded myself with a cleaner for my house) and keep reading r/loseit. Seriously you guys are amazing!

I could not wrap my mind around the idea of how I had let my weight get this bad. Enough was enough. It was now time for a change.

My first day I decided to go on a hike with a buddy of mine

Around this time I learned that my police department was going to begin hiring detention officers. In my mind I thought this would be awesome if I could you use that as motivation to continue to lose weight. Naturally I applied and decided to step up my efforts. That's when I came across My Fitness Pal. I began to track my calories and start walking in the afternoons. Right away I noticed a steady decline in my weight

Man!! The idea of eating fatty foods for weight loss seemed too good to be true

Fast forward a couple months and I had lost an additional 20lbs. I was feeling more comfortable with my weight so I decided to hit that trail again. My buddy I had went with previously was surprised I was able to complete the trail and was so motivated to want to continue on a daily basis. Soon I was lifting weights daily and hiking every other day. I continued this up until around January of 2013. 

By this time I had already had two oral boards for the detention officer position I had applied for and was now down to 213 lbs.One of the Sgts was thoroughly impressed with my progression so he recommended I meet with our departments fitness expert. After explaining to him what I had been doing for the past 8 months he could not believe it. He administered some test and found my cardio was shit, ""Wow I'm actually doing this"".

Since then I've been sticking to regular routine of running and tracking my calories. Unfortunately the academy class I was scheduled to be a part of has been postponed until January 2014. However I'm  not fretting over that. As of today I have lost 130+lbs am scheduled to test for 2 different agencies to become a police officer recruit. I still have a ways to go. My next goal is to cut to 160 using intermittent fasting and taking up weight lifting again along with running.

We started eating much less (typical day for me is greek yogurt for breakfast, another snack, salad for dinner, popcorn, water and coffee to drink) and exercising much more (C25K plus yoga/body weight exercises).  As of this morning he weighs 152lbs (about 25lbs lost) and I weigh 148lbs (45lbs lost).  He is now fully in maintenance mode and still running, but eating his full TDEE.  I counted calories rigidly for the first three months (summer 2012) but have found that eating in a fairly regimented way has worked for me and I have continued to lose all year long.  I eat about 1600/kcal during the week and am a bit more relaxed on the weekends, but compensate with increased workouts if I go significantly over.  I would like to lose maybe 5-10lbs more but I am just going to continue to eat the way I have been eating and exercising.  I will get there eventually.

**Here is what I have learned:**

1.  Doing this together has been amazing but also hard.  Before this I had been eating the same amount of food as my husband.  Since I am shorter than he is and a woman (thus less muscle mass) I can't do that if I want to be smaller than he is.  Realizing this was huge.  No more ""splitting"".  We now break things in half, you can totally do it.  Don't let that be an excuse.

2.  We were thankfully both very healthy and happy before.  Now we are HEALTHIER and HAPPIER.  It is so worth it.

3. The sex is UH-MAAAAZ-ING.  People talk about why they decide to lose weight.  For me it was to look better.  For him it was to be able to run around with the kids.  For some it is about getting healthier.  I swear, and have better stamina.  What could be better than that?

4. The easiest way for me to lose the weight was to cut way down on the carbs.  But

DIET

I started by simply counting calories with MyFitnessPal. I then learned about keto / slow carb

My diet has been and is now effectively the slow carb diet. Only proteins, organic eggs and about 100g of turkey kilbassa with cayenne pepper for my 30g+ of protein. Sashimi has become my main ""treat"" during the week. I don't eat any starches (potatoes, pasta, bread, etc.) or sugars, I drink no calories, and I don't drink alcohol. I allow myself 1 cheat day a week where I can do any of that as much as I want.

Right now

EXERCISE

Very little in terms of serious working out. Running on a track or around the city / stair climbing in my apartment for 30 -60 minutes at least three times a week plus lots of walking wherever and whenever I could.

The fact is: when you're very overweight, running, weights, even cardio like yoga or pilates which is my main activity.

It seems a lot of people get discouraged because they'll take a beginner class and find it's too hard. Or they don't understand why they just aren't picking things up really fast. And then they quit

It's taken me the entirety of the 6months of my journey so far for me to be able to complete a 35 minute yoga/pilates class at my gym on a regular basis. I do this activity because of a back injury which occurred 6 months ago, and my flexibility have improved. 

I recently did a life fit test for VO2 - and got a rating that was extremely poor - even after losing 40lbs. A bit sad

I still cannot bend over and pick something up off the ground but I can squat down a bit and grab things on low tables or chairs that way (I am kind of tall though).

I can't sleep on my side yet. Sleeping on my back is really getting annoying. I have new back pain for now but I know once I heal

Because the brachioplasty incisions go from my elbow to my lower armpit

The scars going down the middle of my torso and across my pubic line from hip to hip are healing great and they aren't a problem at all.

When it comes to sneezing and coughing, they will tighten your abdominal wall. You can literally feel the stitches when you move, cough, sneeze, twist/turn too far, etc. It gets better every day but I imagine it'll be at least 3 more weeks before I can fully cough or sneeze and not want to die.

**That's it so far.** The procedures are serious business but it hasn't been so unbearable that I was in chronic agony the first few days and seriously

What I've done: food-wise - mindful eating. Smaller portions, but I watch what I eat and make a conscious effort to eat either healthier, or in much smaller quantities. It was difficult at first, but it isn't really a problem anymore. My stomach gets very full very easily now that I've shrunk it down substantially.

Mid Afternoon - Fruit + Go ahead bar and a nice cup of tea =)


Dinner - Meat and veg then natural yoghurt with some strawberries/raspberries or other sweeter fruits.

And in terms of exercise all I did was really treadmill workout. I'd start off at a slow pace (9) and slowly increase my speed 0.1 every minute until I got to 10. When I first started I could barley run for more than four minutes. Now depending on speed I can probably run for about an hour if I really wanted to but I just stick to about 3-5miles. Now I like to add some strength and condition. I do pull-ups and crunches/planks/seals and sometimes a bit of rowing but people like different exercises so it's a bit personal preference.

How I did it:

I started on November 14th, and have been eating around there ever since. I try to eat under 50g carbs a day, but ultimately I try to stay under 100g. I cut out most sugar, but sometimes I want kettlecorn or pie, and this diet wouldn't be sustainable if I cut everything I enjoyed out of my life. I eat as much protein as possible, as it keeps me really full, and if I feel hungry (especially if I just ate maybe an hour or so ago) I have a big cup of tea of coffee. 

In January I added a 25 pound kettlebell, and have been using that ever since. I've gone from 3 ""girly"" knees on the floor push ups, to 42 real ones. And I've gone from a size 12 to a size 4-6!

Lately I've been tired of just lifting 35 pounds, bench 75, and ALMOST do a pull up, and for the first time EVER someone called me ""fit"".

During this entire time

Unfortunately I have a shitty camera, I think. 

My ultimate end goal is 125-130 lbs

Caloric deficit of about 500-600 calories a day was used for the fat loss while cycling carbohydrate intake to maximize the speed of losing. Usual daily intake was around 1800 calories a day but sometimes dipped as low as 1400 on some non-training days.

Workouts were Resitance training on a 4 day split with one day of rest after each 4 day split, and 20-30 min of HIIT cardio on leg days.

A frequent question people ask is how often you weigh in.  Most people suggest once a week because of ups and downs.  I weigh myself every morning when I wake up, but after that, every day). 

[The Graph](http://imgur.com/HrB6kVx)

I wanted to share this so you can see what weight loss looks like, then up then down.  I even labeled the reasons why for some of the bigger slip-ups.  I hope that this inspires some of you not to worry too much about the day-to-day weight but to keep focused on the long run.

How I did it: Literally I track everything I eat.  At the start it was calorie deficits only.  But now I go to the gym every single day (or almost every day) for cardio and weight lifting.  But mostly it's the food. On a typical day I have a 1000 calorie deficit or there-abouts.  I try to eat between 900-1500 each day (I'm 5'1"" so I would not recommend under 1200 for the taller redditors out there).  I've pretty much given up carbs in favor of meat and veggies.  Bacon and eggs have been my go-to meal - they're (surprisingly) low calorie and very filling. Carbs

At the gym I try to do an hour of cardio each day.  Weight lifting is mostly upper body strength oriented with the weight machines (no free weights yet).

What I really like about tracking the weight loss day to day is that I can see the immediate result of the day prior.  It keeps me honest.  I can't pretend I've had a 1000 calorie deficit every day if the weight just isn't budging.  And it makes me immediately accountable for the day prior.",,t5_2rz8w,1369181933.0,,60lbs,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1eqaaw/my_progress_so_far_a_graph_on_what_weight_loss/

It isn't helping either that I'm currently trying to gain muscle and eating at a surplus. It feels even more shitty to tell her to stop eating while I make myself another PBJ Sandwich to get my calories.

We go to the gym 3 times a week together and that works really well. I think her problem is simply too much food. Not even junk food, she just eats a lot of volume  and is miserable when she's hungry.

I'm rather skinny myself and have little experience with weight loss. Do you have any tips how I could support the woman I love to reach her goals?


EDIT: Ok

Summary what I took away:

- Telling her to stop eating is a bad idea even if she asks me to do it.
- We are now both using MyFitnessPal to track calories better. It will help both of us achieving our (different) weight goals. 
- I will try to make sure there's always low calorie food at home that she likes. 
- I will try to eat my calorie dense food out of her sight.
- I will propose only cooking as much as we will eat. It's a little bit inconveniant because of no leftovers
- in the end she needs to learn to control herself and there's little I can do to help her do that except stay supportive.",,t5_2rz8w,1366193445.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1cgk4s/how_can_i_support_my_gf_with_losing_weight/

So I decided to do something about it. I started out at 274 lbs (6'2). It's no miracle diet or anything, and generally very low in carbs. Not sure what else to put here


Initially I didn't really do any exercising. After losing 30 lbs strictly from dieting I decided to start exercise. I own a stair stepper
I recently picked up running and began biking as well. So now I run 5-ish miles a day 5 or 6 days a week. Sometimes running is replaced with biking 20 or 30 miles. And when I have time for neither it's back to the good ol stair-stepper. Seriously

Food wise I buy tons of lettuce, peppers (sweet peppers), various types of lite/fat free dressing, croutons, and bacon shavings (not bacon bits, fuck that shit).
Basically I'll throw any mixture of that stuff in a bowl, and nothing else. Other times I'll have 2 or 3 small salads throughout the day.


For a portion of my losing, a big salad for lunch, and a shake for dinner. No matter how hungry I got I would not eat anything extra. It's a pain, and it sucks, but it's worth it. You're getting more than enough calories out of those three things, so you've had enough for the day. If you can do that for a month, then you can probably do anything I've mentioned.

First off with the stats: I'm 23 M, I never really watched my weight. I was always that ""fat kid"". I used to be one of those nay sayers that thought I could never lose weight because it was genetics wah wah wah. Then I told myself ""C_Terror you could cry and be a little bitch, or you could man up and do something about it.""

I found /r/loseit and /r/fitness and basically got started from there. (Seriously

First the Pictures:

[Before

[After

I went from 215 to roughly 178

My big three lifts (have herniated my spine twice) 

Bench: ~225 to 325
Deadlifts: ~135 to 365
Squats: ~95 to 275

My Summer routine consisted of:

Monday: 5K run

Tuesday: Back + Biceps
- Deadlifts
- Pullups/Assisted Pullups
- Bent over Rows
- Dumb bell rows
- Hammer Curls
- Preacher Curls
- Ab rollers

Wednesday: 5K run 

Thursday: Chest + Triceps
- Flat barbell bench
- Inclined dumb bell bench
- Dips/Assisted Dips
- Cable crosses
- Tricep pull downs
- Weighted Ab pull downs

Friday: 5K run

Saturday: Rest day

Sunday: Legs + Shoulders
- Squats
- Leg Extensions
- Leg Curls 
- Calf Raises
- OHP
- Clean + Jerk 
- Shrugs
- Sitting Dumbbell Raises
- Ab rollers

Now that it's winter

My next steps are to cut down to ~10% BF at 170, human flag, and to dunk. Oh how I'm looking forward to dunking a basketball. 

**EDIT** Many people were asking about my Bench numbers because it seemed unbelievable

""My original 1RM on the Bench was 325+ a couple years ago
I kept most of my LBM during my cut (It was a very clean protein heavy cut)
Wasn't too much programming

**EDIT v2** Many people are also asking about examples of diet. 

I was extremely strict with my diet in the first month; a typical day was:

Breakfast: 1 cup of Kashi grain cereal (~70 calories)

Lunch: 1 chicken breast seasoned with montreal steak spice + srirarcha and handful of arugula and baby spinach

Mid Afternoon: 2 scoops of protein shake with cold water

Dinner: 10 oz steak with 3 eggs

I'd average ~8-10 cups of water a day.

However, especially in an Asian household wouldn't last. I slowly regressed to eating whatever my mom made (generally pretty healthy) while cutting off the rice. I'd make rough estimations on how much calories each dish was, and in my mind proportion them accordingly. Luckily, my parents were very understanding and didn't give me too much shit for not eating rice. I cook my own food at lunch when I'm at work (also saves a lot of money from going out to buy).

Slowly

If I'm really craving something (i.e. Fries) I learned a littly trick from /r/loseit, then top it off with a couple more fries. Got my fix, tricked my body into thinking I ate a lot of fries, and caloric damage was negligible.

I started with water cardio (aquafit, I started an intense HIIT program, twice a week. Added to that, I take a spinning class on Saturdays, and I run 2-3 times a week. Also I eat much better.

And support! People on MFP are just the best supporters ever. They mean the world to me.

I apologize for what was likely a strange sight for you this morning. You see, not wanting to share with friends in case it failed miserably. But over the last 3 weeks I've seen my stamina and skills grow without a thought. I think in the past I've pushed too hard, overthought things and burnt out quickly because of it- giving up before it even got to the point where it actually started to get hard. 

Not today. Today was the first in my life what I exercised for 2 miles, the embarrassment of gym class where the mile long fitness run test resulted in only a 3/4 mile and took me 35 minutes. Then smoking and ennui as a college kid, I didn't even think about working out during that time. I didn't even think I could do it last year, when I was walking a mile a day. It just seemed impossible to get over that distance with the shin splints, coupled with back spasms from hours spent waitressing. Then, I quit entirely as life got complicated with 2 moves and 3 jobs within a year. But today I did something I never thought I could. And it wasn't even hard.

    Jan 2009 Weight loss competition. Diet: Modified 4hr body. Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work. I was working out in a clubhouse gym

    June 2009 Join a 24hr gym. More resistance training

    Feb 2010 First 5k. 33min

    March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness. Start Spinning 2-3 times/week. Lifting 6 days week.

    Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon 2:0X:XX

    May 2011 Find Fittit. Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me.

    Nov 2011 Sign up for IMAZ 2012. Stop drinking during the week.

    Dec 2011 Bought road bike

    April 2012 First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman 5:3X:XX

    Advice (for what it's worth)

    Find a diet with food you like. I still eat chicken

    Start doing the big compound lifts

    Interval training works

    You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet. I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.

    Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.

A sincere thanks to you Fittit. Couldn't have done it without you.

  Around 2006 I was freaked out enough that I finally met with a nutritionist and started working out and eating much better.  At the time, lots of aspects of my life got hectic then and I got distracted from my disciplined lifestyle so I hovered around 215 or so for quite a while. 

  Then, lost my home, pets, relationship, life savings, purpose, and mind. For a while there

  Riding the winds of change and lacking a better plan, head still spinning.  By mid 2009 I had regained about 35 pounds.  Most of that was pasta.  Pasta is cheap.

  Eventually, left the stupid relationship, and started the uphill climb.  I made the decision at that time to become a vegetarian for environmental and ethical reasons.  A few pounds trickled off but I wasn't trying very hard and I was often falling prey to the ""carbs and cheese"" vegetarian lifestyle.  I stuck where I was for a while, slowly pulling all the pieces of my life back together, regaining some stability and figuring out who the hell I was now.   

  Over the next year and a half or so, finally.  I started really finding myself.  My new self.  I ditched the dumbass, moved to an awesome city, and found a positively wonderful job.  Things were looking up!  

  In November 2011, I committed to finishing what I started and hit the gym again and got my nutrition in order.  

  Still vegetarian, but my previously symptomatic PCOS basically vanished, my mood stabilized, my energy shot through the roof, and people started noticing.

  Realizing then that I was capable of making major dietary restrictions and sticking to them, and sugars at a minimum, and to get plenty of vegetable protein.  Vegan high-protein meal replacements and soy products are life savers, and the rest is just about eating whole, nutritious, *real* food.  I feel better than I ever have; I know this is a decision that I'll stick to for life.  

  And here I am now.  As of the date of this post I weigh about 175 pounds and I am a size 12/14.  I would like to lose an additional 45 pounds or so, while I'm enjoying my life and doing what I do.  I go out and have fun and eat some kind of junky stuff sometimes, but I always go back to my same healthful routines and my body continues to feel great and shed pounds.  

  Just a few of the wonderful things that have resulted from this change:

 - I AM FREE!  I no longer feel like I'm trapped inside of a body that hinders me.   

 - My relationship with food is healthy and sustainable and makes my body feel great, heart disease, and all kinds of other conditions.   

 - I have a sense of accomplishment that has taught me that I really can do anything to which I commit.  

 - I can shop wherever I want.  I totally love my new wardrobe.  In fact

 - I get more respect.  I hate how true this is

 - I feel more outgoing and shiny and brave.  

 - I can go caving all day and slither through tiny underground tunnels.  

 - I am no longer ""She of the eternally Friend-Zoned.""  Cute boys have expressed interest!  Eeeeee!

  ...And on

Thank you so, inspiration, and constant reminders that the best way is simply to work hard at it and DO it.  There is no try.  You guys are proof that most people who feel defeated are themselves the only thing in the way of success and that with the right information and support system, just about anyone can free their inner skinny kid.

I've always been big. I topped 100 pounds in third grade (I wasn't tall either) and spent most of high school at around 185 (5'7"" female). Even though I liked recreational activities like biking, I also really loved sitting and reading and eating. I was never teased or in any way made to feel less than beautiful because of my weight, but it didn't stop me from feeling awkward and uncomfortable in my skin. I was scared to try running or going to the gym or even making an obvious effort to eat healthy for fear of somehow looking like the stereotypical ""big girl"" or worse, trying and failing. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis during my senior year of high school, and although that took off some weight, it wasn't a significant amount. 

When I started college 4 years ago, a year and a half ago, I met my wonderful now fiancé! That was really the turning point for me. From the moment we met, he made me feel pretty and sexy and supported and happy. Somehow, having the reassurance that I was beautiful the way that I was gave me the courage and the incentive to try being the healthiest, happiest me I knew I could be. Slowly, I started going to the gym, doing pushups during commercial breaks, but today I realized how hard I’ve worked and how proud I am – finally- of myself

I'm not long winded but I'll give a bit of back story.  About 6 years ago I was in a better spot financially and was able to afford a personal trainer.  My starting weight was 339.8 pounds.  I paid $100-120 per week for 3 sessions with a personal trainer.  Basically did 5 days per week of weight training and cardio.  My diet was a traditional low-carb diet but allowed for things such as wheat breat, etc.  The majority of what I ate consisted of grilled chicken, salmon, veggies, brown rice or wheat bread.  My diet was very low fat (didn't each much high fat meats).  In 10 months I lost 110 pounds and ended up losing a total of 118.  

At some point through a series of random incidents, my mom developing cancer and eventually dying (which included 6 months in the hospital, eating mostly fast food and restaurant food) I gained all of the weight that I lost back.  I stayed fairly unhappy and sedentary for a year or two and, through advice of some friends, had been researching Crossfit as well as the Paleo diet.  

Last June I weighed in at 340.8 pounds (if you're paying attention, down from 340.8 to 199.6.  I've gone from 4X shirts and 48"" pants to L/XL shirts and 36"" pants.  I am literally in the best shape of my entire life and couldn't be happier.  My current diet consists traditional Paleo diet.  I eat a lot of meat (chicken, steak, pork (and LOTS of BACON), eggs, sweet potatoes, fruit, etc).  

A few words of advice:  Find a program that you enjoy and you WILL stick with it.  Conversely, personal trainers at every session, motivation, accountability, etc etc, all rolled into one.  I absolutely love going to Crossfit and I hate not being able to go.  I go 4-6 times per week, mostly 5.  Also, nevermind.

I have posted a comparison picture that takes you from my heaviest weight (fall semester of my freshman year of college) to 11 months into my weight loss journey (fall semester of my sophomore year of college) to a current photo (winter break of my junior year of college). 

I have posted before, in my freshman year, that I was tired of being defined as 'the fat girl'. I was tired of being called 'pretty for my size'. I was tired of what I saw in the mirror. I've always been overweight my whole life, minus maybe to age 3. I was the oddball of my family. Every single person in my family (at my age) was at a healthy weight (granted their current weights are not...well, healthy...) I hated that I got the shit end of the stick. So I made changes. Slow, but sure changes. 

Through trying things in the past, it wouldn't last). I started working out more regularly. I subbed in healthier options over less healthy options. 

Losing the weight has been slow going. It has taken me 23 months to lose 80 pounds. But that's a HUGE number! The big goal I set for myself when I first started was to lose 100 pounds. Ultimately though

I've always been fat. I constantly got made fun of for it when I was a child, my friends would get jealous (as THEY didn't want to be the fat friend) and make me feel bad about it, so it'd stop. 

A few years ago, and thought I deserved nothing else. How wrong I was.). I became depressed, and started eating everything in sight. My highest weight was 190. 

During one week in 2010, that abusive boyfriend burned my house down, then proceeded to break up with me for a newly 16 year old girl (he was 21 at the time), and I got fired from my job (for calling out because my house burned down. wtf). That was in one. single. week......I stopped eating. I was so stressed, that I couldn't keep down any food. I'd eat nibbles here and there because I didn't want to *die*, but in the span of one month, I lost about 40 pounds. It was awful, and I felt disgusting. 

Eventually I started eating again, my boyfriend and I decided that we no longer wanted to be unhealthy, and we both changed our lives for the better. Since November 14, 2011, I've lost a little over 30 pounds by lifting weights, and eating right (about 1200-1300 calories a day. Clean eating)

What I did:  

Step 1.  Gave up fast food for Lent last year.  
Step 2.  Limited one meal per day for 6 months (work at lunch was one  apple and a lean cuisine meal anywhere from 220-380 calories) while limiting myself to 1500 calories a day. 

Step 3. Walking three days per week for 6 months for at least 1 hour a day.  This started off being 2 -3 miles but as I gained strength and speed

Step 4.  Joined a gym:  Paid $99 for a 3 session workout with a personal trainer.  He taught me many forms of calisthetics

Step 5.  Yoga/Pilates/Zumba classes two to three days per week.  I did this as my main workout for a long time. Now I only do Zumba two days per week as my high end cardio to offset my current strength training routine. 

Step 6.  Increased my calories to 2000/day. Changed diet slightly by adding lots of Protein

Step 7.  Begin 12 week strength training program that I found on /r/fitness's  FAQ  Entitled the [Female Fitness Bible](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/womans_lean_sexy_bible.htm)  I follow this almost completely.  I use a different form of protein powder though.  Ask me if you want to know.  Currently in week 8 of this program.

**final edit:**  I made it clear this wasn't something I was personally dealing with. Please stop making **harassing comments about how I personally am making excuses and should just unsubscribe and go see a doctor because i am too lazy to actually try.**

Because so many of you think I am making a personal arguement against responsibility

My personal opinion is specific. If a child grows up in an environment where their parents do not provide them with adequate nutrition - From the ages of 0-16 - then it should not be ""on them"". It is not their fault that they are overweight. They grow up with bad habits because their families are irresponsible

HOWEVER

Having said this, should do anything within the power to help themselves, as long as it is healthy.

Some of you have suggested simple calorific deficit is good enough. I beg to differ in this case. You will never find a nutritionist that says it's okay for children and young adults who are still developing to maintain a diet which is deficient simply because the calorific intake is restricted. 

That is all I really have to say.

I'd appreciate those of you who have been giving me ""personal advice"" to stop. It is not only hurtful

So when 2011 started, including depression and agoraphobia. However, at the beginning of 2011, I was beginning to overcome them. As my body was improving and I was taking more pride in myself, everything around me was getting a lot better.

In 2011, and I lifted weights 4 times a week without injury. 2011 was an amazing year for me.

I live in Kannapolis, we only saw each other once a year after I moved. My wife and I had made it tradition visit on New Years. I started my transformation in March of 2010, so that New Years had already passed. However, by the time I got to 2011 and hadn't told him I'd took an interest in fitness yet, I thought it'd be pretty awesome if I skipped the 2011 trip and waited until 2012 to see him again.

I underestimated how hard it'd be to keep the secret because as time went on

A few days ago

A lot of our communication, I knew he'd recognize my voice, so I just stood there like a creeper holding a phone in his face. He shot me death glare as you would a threat to your family. In that moment, I was a complete and utter stranger to the person who knew me best of anyone else in the world aside from my wife.

I got the very distinct impression he was about to punch me so I blurted out ""JESSE!"" which is my name. After a few moments of doe-eyed reflection

So for me, like a stable career in fitness and nutrition.

So that was my 2011 and here's to a badass 2012

Whenever I'd go to my parents house to visit and do laundry I had been tossing my oversized clothes Rubbermaid bin I was storing in their basement.  I didn't give much thought to this

This past weekend my Dad noticed the bin and asked why I was bothering to keep the clothes. It caught me off guard and I immediately felt embarrassed. Before I could answer he said ""You know

Despite the fact Cortés actually sank the ships (and eventually killed thousands of indigenous Aztec people) my Dad was right. We dragged the bin to my car and drove it to the nearest Salvation Army drop off.  

My Dad helped me unload and empty the bin. When we were done he said he was proud of me. I joked that the bin wasn't THAT heavy and this WAS a tax deductible write-off so it wasn't a selfless act. He rolled his eyes

He said he knew what I was doing is hard and he thought it was important I knew how proud he was of me for doing it. 

He had caught me off guard for the second time that day, thanked him, and we hugged. 

My old man isn't usually a hugger. I guess it seems sort of odd to share an emotional father son moment while waiting for the toothless Salvation Army clerk to write a donation receipt as you awkwardly stand in the parking lot between Stop &amp; Shop and a Joanne Fabrics

...this was the single most encouraging and profound NSV I've had since starting this ""project of self improvement"". It was a small gesture that meant more to me than he'll probably ever know.

*Food* - Count calories (1700/day, cap it around 100g/day, 150g on heavy work out days). I eat every 2-3 hours.

I still drink alcohol, however, to just have ONE of something. I had to teach myself this, but it's possible. Just one cookie is way better than just one pan of cookies.

*Exercise* - Strong Lifts 5x5, you might not. **Do what you love.** On off lifting days, I either bike 8-10 miles or swim for 45 minutes (unless I am sore, then I take a rest day). I also walk everywhere, as I have the luxury of living in a big city. I have become WORLDS more active and healthier. I look forward to my workouts, especially running.

Currently 225lbs, I think the scale is such a small, and often unreliable part of the whole picture. I go by how I feel, how clothes fit (was a US size 28 and 3X, now US 16 and L) and my measurements.

I feel like the first guy is me, how beneficial to my career it would be (not something I can go into I'm afraid) and how much happier I would be thin.

Let me tell you a secret. They are afraid of you. They are afraid of you because you are the man, yes, broken into razor-sharp sand, but never finished. You are the mass of meat that lies on the ground, getting beaten around the clock, that will just not die. 

Somewhere inside you is something that wants out. It's something no husband can slap away. No loved one can take with them when they die. No corporation can claim when they take your job and your dignity with it. As long as you draw breath it is there

They have it. We all have it. The difference between you and them is that they don't need it, it has been mocked and discounted and cast aside on virtue of being unworthy. 

You are not weak. Fucking say it out loud. Not. Weak. It isn't weakness to break. Even diamonds become dust when you pound on them long enough. Food is comfort, it is the only good thing your life has to offer, a healing potion of high fructose corn syrup and sodium bromide. 

Then, and the light at the end of the tunnel is the place where it can't get any worse. But it can always get worse, until the day you stand.

You buy sweatpants and a bandana. You tie it around your head and you walk a mile and sweat like a pig. It takes you ten times the effort to do a tenth of what they do. You want to give it up. Maybe you do

You feel the dopamine tingle that comes with seeing the numbers on the scale going in the other direction for a change. Now you're on the path. They're fucking scared, at some point, that stopped being true. You slipped past them without anyone realizing what was happening. 

This is part of why they fear you. The world forgot about you a long time ago. Someone wrote you off as the girl with the huge tits - thanks, brilliant and kind and all. They didn't forget about you. They dismissed you, THEN they forgot about you. 

Only now here you are.

Here you are going from walking a mile to walking two. Now three. Now five. Now you run half of it. Now you run all of it. Now you lift. Ten pounds. Twenty. Fifty. Ninety. In the heat, when you're hungry. Always hungry. God, but you are so fucking hungry, sometimes. 

You were a soul beaten down and forgotten. Life and all its cruelty saw fit to grind you into paste. Only now... here you are again. Your gut is shrinking. You look in the mirror one day and... is that a two pack? You can see your abs. You didn't even know you had abs. Just the world's biggest bully button.

The fear on their faces is a mix of awe and wonder. You can come roaring back. Even after all of it, you can come back and surpass them. All of them. That's why they fear you. They fear what you're capable of. 

They should be afraid. You're unstoppable.

Hey everyone! My name is Chelsea. I did [Tough Mudder](http://toughmudder.com/) in October of last year. I was over 200 at the time. Although I did some weight lifting, but I completed all 12 miles with help from my dad, husband, and three amazing friends! I didn't feel huge at the time. Thennnn we got our event photos back. WHAT?! I LOOK LIKE THAT?! Wow, now that was motivation. Particularly the photo I posted above in the before/after link. So, I started weight watchers at 204.8 in January. I didn't do any form of exercise for the first three months and lost 25 pounds. I made [my first loseit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1bff0d/i_wont_be_eating_cake_on_my_cake_day/) on my cake day and shortly after, incorporated running. I lost a few more pounds

I am down 43.6 pounds and [finally looking a little ""fit""](http://i.imgur.com/AFAxF16.jpg)! I stopped weight watchers about 2 weeks ago and started counting calories instead because I wasn't eating enough with weight watchers and the intensity of the training I am now doing.

I've been a heavy person my entire life. A lot of people say that, so I didn't know my numbers, but I would guess that I got to around 220 and I'd already about gotten to my current height of 5'11"". I lost motivation for the gym and started just hanging out with friends, which actually wasn't so bad for me. I don't think I gained much weight if any as we did a lot of walking and biking around town.  
  
I got a job, but I was not having it.  
  
There were two events that finally really opened my eyes. In January or February of 2012 my mother (who I lived with) was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. I spent most of the first 6-week round of chemo with her in the hospital. I was too big for the chair and it was extremely uncomfortable. Then in May my long-time girlfriend and I made plans to go with another couple to Vegas in November. I was practically pretrified by the thought of either having to ask for a seatbelt extender or being asked to pay for a second seat
  
But now
  
We had a bathroom scale that I finally stepped on for the first time. Error. Not surprised. I didn't care though. I had basically no knowledge of fitness or healthy diet, but it felt so good to know that I was doing something good for myself. I was pumped up. I got a gym membership after I got shin splints (which I attributed to working too hard too fast on too hard a surface). I went every day I had the opportunity.  
  
I got myfitnesspal on my phone and ignored their allotted calories, but having previously been a heavy soda drinker, I also had (and still ahve) a diet soda when I really want one (not very often anymore - mostly when out at a restaurant). I also limited myself to eating out no more than once every two weeks, which more than paid for the gym membership.  
  
I can't remember how long it took, I didn't think I could weigh that much. On the other, I knew I had to weigh that much and I was ecstatic that I now had a reading! I decided that my starting weight had to be somewhere around 370.  
  
Since that moment not much has changed in my routine. As my mom's condition got worse my workouts got more spaced out
  
My mom continued to get worse and just recently passed in March. It's been very tough for me since then I've made a lot of excuses in the past two months to eat and skip workouts and make poor choices
  
My current workout routine consists of at least 3 days at the gym per week.  
Day 1: 30 mins (or more if not sweating yet) of various strength exercises targeting arms and upper body. Next 30 mins spent between any mix of bike, Jacob's Ladder, and stairmaster - but always ending with running at least 10 mins on treadmill. I recently started HIIT on the treadmill.  
Day 2: Same but with focus on legs for strength training.  
Day 3: All cardio! I hate day 3
  
So what am I down to now? Well, and the highest I've caught myself at was 231, which was the push to getting back on track. Right now I'm about 225. My goal is 190, then I'd like to really focus on weights as I enjoy that the most.

I posted a before and after of my current weight loss, I started in May 2009 and this is a picture of August 2011. I had a personal trainer for 9 months of this which became very much my best friend during that time. In that 9 months I went from 320lb to 185lb and I lost the next 15lb over 6 more months. Just so you do know, I ate the same thing for 9 months, 90 minutes of cardio and 45 weight lifting. Went from 80lb bench press to 280 and at the time of the photo could see my 2nd set of abs (some days). 

Here's too inspiration for you, ""don't think, just do"" if you have that mentality, although, difficult you can accomplish anything, get anywhere and reach and exceed any goal. Good luck everyone!

A year ago, I would come home afterwards and lay on my couch feeling absolutely beat. I don’t think I realized how limited my lifestyle was. But the instructor was so nice and supportive that I always had fun and felt good about myself afterwards – this was a totally new experience in my life.

As I became more active and starting doing zumba more often, so I now eat between 1200-1600 calories a day of what essentially amounts to a non-strict version of paleo.

After 6 months of zumba, I started taking a Powerlifting course at the local Y to improve some issues I was having with my lifts, and have since been doing Starting Strength 3x week. I hope to compete next summer and meanwhile, I am training to run my first 5K in the fall.  

Last night

 I thought I was going to be disappointed  because 60lbs lost seems like such a small number and when I look in the mirror I still see the same person that I've seen my entire life. Instead I feel a little bit shocked at how much progress I’ve made. I’m glad that all the small things that I’ve done consistently have added up and produced measurable results

If you are reading this and unsure how to change, and only you can decide if it’s worth doing. Take it one day at a time because you’ve got your body for life, so if you don’t get it right today, tomorrow is a whole new day. :)

So how do you lose 100#?  Diet, but it had all came back.  My size 18W jeans were getting tight and I had a reality check when I ran out of conference clothes that really fit well that I thought I looked good in. This was in March 2011, and by April 2011 I had a reality check – I was not happy, and wanted to change my life.

I started small

Then I joined SparkPeople.com for continued motivation. I know most of Reddit likes myfitnesspal.com, with cardio on at least three days. Over time I’ve had to increase both time and then intensity to keep up with my increasing fitness level.  When I started out, I started small – 10 crunches… 50 crunches… now I do over 2000 in different positions—but it takes awhile.  Don’t think you can get there overnight or expect results immediately.  I’ve taken a year and a half and I’m not done yet.

During this time I also was on a restricted diet for kidney stones, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, and allergies.  I can’t even begin to tell you how much better I feel now both physically and mentally.

2012 has been less about losing weight and more about toning.  I’m 5’10” so I honestly don’t think I’ll lose that much more. Instead I’m switching into more muscle building and more intense strength training. I am not one of the lucky ones whose skin magically rebounded. I had a brachioplasty three weeks ago to remove upper arm skin (4” on each arm!)

I just want everyone to know they can do this. Thanks r/loseit for continued motivation. Sometimes if I’m feeling crabby about my body/weight or feel like a binge – I come on here to check out all of your success stories (both SV and NSV).

Story: This past 4th of July I went to my friends pop's house to blow shit up and go swimming. The very next day I saw some pictures of me in my underoos swimming in the river and realized that I had lost control. So, another eye opener, but finally found one. 389lbs. Sweet merciful baby Jesus. How had I let it come to this? That was it. Change or die. So I cleaned up my diet. Went with MFP and keep myself around 1500 cal/ day. Didn't really start working out until November. November 1st I quit smoking, and started C25k. Let me say, the program is amazing. My fat ass runs 3 miles every other day now, and I couldn't feel better. Today being January 5th is 6 months after when I started this journey, so I decided to break my every-other-week weigh in and hop on the scale this morning. 
288lbs. Glory glory hallelujah! Just over 100lbs shed in 6 months. I'd never have thought I was capable of this. 

If I can answer any questions for anyone please let me know, ""damn it feels good to be a gangster"".

It's been easy to stay on because 1) I'm not hungry throughout the day (explanation below) and 2) the rewards come so fast it's VERY motivating. 

Because I'm eating low calorie, a candy bar at 10, piece of pizza at noon, etc.). Picture it as ""rolling waves"" instead of big spikes. That moderates the carb-fueled crash-and-crave cycle that's a typical part of the American diet.

It can be done!

I lost my weight on a medically supervised program via a certified Bariatrician (not surgery) which included protein 6x day

edit to add more info:
total weight lost: 110 lbs in 8 1/2 months over 4 years ago. This lead me into the field of bariatric *medicine* (not surgery).  I am a member of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians (ASBP) and the Chairperson for the ASBP Pediatric Task Force.

Starting weight: 278 lbs
Ending weight: 168 lbs
Height: 5'11""

Obesity is, and never by themselves (I link them with a bit of fat &amp; protein to blunt the effect on my blood sugar).  I no longer have GERD (for which I was on medication, required an EGD, and was in constant pain) and I no longer suffer from a Fatty Liver.  I know when I've had too many carbs when my hunger comes roaring back.  It is at that point, I back up from carbs which will help to control it.  I exercise for what it does for my mood (as weight loss is about 90% diet/ 10% exercise).  I hope this update give some more info. Please let me know if I can share anything else with you.

As for my story, it got ugly. Gained 25 pounds over the course of 2 months and went on to play college ball for a whole 3 days before being injured. From there it spiraled out of control and I finally topped the chart junior year of college at 340.

Fast forward to the year after I graduated from school in 2010 and finally fed up with my ginormous self. Determined to finally lose the weight, always helping each other with workouts and meal preparations and whatnot. Through cutting down on carbs and working my ass off at the gym, I went from 340 in October of 2010 down to 220 in May of 2011. If anybody out there needs advice or more importantly, support, let me know. Because as hard as you try to go at this endeavor alone, it's so much better physically and emotionally with somebody at your back.

I was also an athlete at the time, I developed disordered eating which consisted of binging and purging that would be accompanied by bulimia. I wasn't happy to do it

A man came over to the house that was a family friend and said something to me that I will never forget. He was always a morbidly obese guy as far back as I can remember, getting a little chunky there. You're starting to look me."" I thought, no fucking way. And that was the moment I decided to change the way I looked. Over the next few months, I took baby steps limiting myself on soda and completely eliminating fast food from my diet. (saved a crapload of money!) By March, I had lost about 10 pounds, and felt pretty good about it, but knew I could do a lot better. I began to browse the weight loss subreddits and came across r/keto and r/loseit. (some redditor told me to go to r/keto. They have bacon!) I would read people's success stories and used them for motivation. Unfortunately that's all I did was have motivation and never did anything with it. But at least I was exposed to this kind of lifestyle and that was important for me. But onto the story

My sister always nagged me about my weight, and it helped tremendously! But on my 21st birthday, my family took me to Las Vegas, and as I was partying in clubs with my sister, I would see all of these beautiful women and they would just dismiss me. They saw me as an overweight guy and would not give me the time of day. It was a kick in the face to me, and I knew that I had a long ways to go. Throughout the next months and into the summer, I took in 200 calories less than I needed, and I was as happy as I could be. I was going on hikes and feeling great. But I wasn't completely satisfied with how I looked

In my fourth year of college, I've been talking to my sister about my progress and what I needed to be doing. She kept harking on me about a paleo diet. She talked about it all summer, and I was not really on board with it too much. It sounded too extreme and hard for me. But the school I was at announced a play in which there was the part of Poseidon. I wanted it. More than anything I've ever wanted in my life before. I knew that it would take something extreme to get the body I needed for the show. So I got a hold of my sister and told her I think I am ready to try a paleolithic type of diet. This was in August of 2012. Between her and an ex-MMA fighter at school, I was given a diet plan. I would eat 6 meals a day. An omlette and grapefruit for breakfast, a spoonful of coconut butter for a snack, meat and veggies for lunch accompanied by a handful of almonds, coconut butter for another snack, and a spoonful of coconut butter before I went to bed. I also incorporated workouts this time. My workouts before were just lifting weights and running long distances. I abandoned weights completely

The paleo way was great for what it was, which was a terrific site. I started keeping track of my Macronutrients and she set me up with a diet program where if I followed it to a tee, then I would get the best results and be in the best shape of my life. She also taught me how to incorporate deadlifts, bench press, and squats in my workouts. I also carb cycled and ate between the hours of 1PM and 9PM. I did what the urbanprimalist did and dropped my weight to 173. And well... why don't you guys see for yourself what it has done for me.

I have been looking forward to sharing this moment with you. Now, drank a few too many beers and ate a few too many McDonald’s burgers. One day in October I just sat down and thought “this needs to change”.


I have a very active family and I have been going to the gym since I was 16, etc) and a little weight lifting. I went to the gym about 3-4 times a week. During the first couple of months I lost about 6 pounds. I found it a little discouraging that it wasn’t losing weight faster so I decided to change up my diet. I had been lurking around r/keto for awhile so it gave me the idea to cut down on carbs in January. Between January and now I have been seeing so much progress with my body. I ended up losing 10 pounds and I really believe it was because I changed my diet. Now I am working on toning my body (lots of weights) but I am still doing 15-20 mins of cardio about 3 times a week. I still eat low carb but I'm not as intense as those on r/keto.

 I took things slow. At the beginning of the year i still ate some ''junk'' food and didn't eat as healthy as i  could have, meat is actually good for you but for me what worked,  was having no meat. The no meat thing made me not want fast food; hamburgers, pizza, Tacos ext.. I started eating salads, i never really liked salads. Then i added croutons and some cheese and OHH MYY GUSHH Yummy ..lol salad became my new best friend. As for breakfast and snacks i would eat things like apples, grapefruits, light yogurts, and vegetable soups. 
Then as I started eating healthier i started drinking lots and lots of water. after a meal I would drink  like 2 cups of water. I usually  drank water

 When i felt hungry and wanted more food i would stop.. Think and ask myself ""is it really worth it?"" 
That thought applied as well when i wanted to eat junk food."" is eating 5 pounds back on really worth all my sacrifices?""

 OK, 30 min walks 3-4 times a week  i gradually moved on to jogging/walking faster for an hour 5 times a week.
 As the year moved along i decided to try p90x (around April)  the first 2 weeks were great i felt good, and September specially since my b-day was in September.
 I  kept going to the gym
 I knew i had to push myself once again. in November i started Hardcore exercising I joined a Zumba class at my local gym. the class was an hour long. I would go to the gym from 3:30-7:00 pm (i had nothing better to do anyways) I lost 11 pounds which put me down at 234 that month. So finally December came I knew i wanted to end my year strong and start my new year strong as well. i pushed myself beyond my limits and lost 13 pounds.

**How I am Doing It**

*All Night Long!* I am doing a modified Keto diet with a base set of carbs at 30 per day. I give myself an extra 10 for a veggie heavy day and an additional 10 for days that I do maxes in the gym. I work out 2-3 times a day for 2.5 hours. It's alot, and then do sprints in the pool OR play basketball/volleyball in the pool.


**Future Goals**

I am going to hit my 400 mark of 266. It's not a goal

Thanks for the vote of confidence guys! [I guess you want to see the goods? Yes?](http://imgur.com/a/tHIuo#0)

I've always been a ""big"" girl.  I had horrifically shitty eating habits and turned to food when I was feeling any emotional extreme.  I don't know when I started emotional eating, food was there to make me feel better - you can't disappoint a bag of chips, you know?

I started to play basketball competitively in the 3rd grade, chips, and popcorn all washed down with a soda or two.  For years, that was what I was eating (although the soda consumption went up to quite a bit more than one or two a day).  I started playing volleyball in jr. high and played all through high school.  Not much makes a 7th grade girl feel worse than playing volleyball in short spandex with girls half her size, but I did it because I loved the game and I wasn't bad at it either.  

My weight kept going up and I tried multiple crash diets and diet supplements to try to lose it.  I was trying appetite suppressants before I even made it to high school.  I went on nutrisystem before I got my driver's license.  I was about 250lbs, I'd lost 30lbs. The problem with nutrisystem is that it doesn't really make you change your real eating habits.  As soon as I quit eating their premeasured cardboard food, I gained it all back, and then some, as that was the year I quit basketball.  My senior year, I was almost cut from my volleyball team by the new coach.  I slipped into the last remaining spot and spent all season trying to prove myself to a woman who'd hated me from the start.  That season sucked and I suspect that I went through a pretty awful depression and was very nearly suicidal at times.  I finished it though and went on to coach the jr. high team that year.  I graduated and went to college where I continued gaining weight, hitting 300lbs two months into my freshman year.  That should have been my wake up call, but I know it had to be over 300.  

Cut to late December 2012.  I'd fallen deeply in love with the actors from The Boondock Saints (especially Norman Reedus... hot damn!) and was reading through Sean Patrick Flanery's blogs.  He runs a BJJ studio and is really passionate about health.  In his blogs, but I realized that I couldn't refute any of the claims he was making.  Those blogs kicked me in the ass and made me figure my shit out (as did this subreddit!).  I got myfitnesspal and began eating as closely to their recommended calorie amounts as I could as well as working out daily.

The weight dropped fast at first because I went from 4-5 cans of soda a day to only drinking water.  I started picking the least evil options from the dining hall, and just ate a lot less in general.  I lost 27lbs in the first two weeks.  At this point in time, I was also buying my tickets to go meet The Boondock Saints (and Michael Rooker) in Portland in February.  I wanted to talk to Sean in person and tell him the impact he'd had on my life.

So I kept at it.  I lost around 35lbs from January 8th-February 23rd and I told Sean

He followed me on twitter (shameless plug: @CeraLynAK if anyone wants to follow me... I'm pretty boring) and I started going harder at the gym.  I was planning to see him again in April and I wanted to impress him again.  I lost another 32lbs before I saw him again.  When he saw me

And now, I've gone from a 3x down to a 1x (and a unisex large!).  I got hit on in a bar where a guy bought my drinks and tried to get me to come up to his hotel room for the first time in my entire life.  I feel good about myself and you better fucking believe I'm not going to stop until I get to where I want to be.

My weight loss story is a very long one, occasionally getting down to about 127 before fluctuating back up into the 130s again, and for a while that was ok. After a while I stopped working out and started eating pretty badly again, and I stopped weighing myself and taking measurements. I guess I was just naively hoping that I wouldn't gain any weight back.

About a month ago I went to Italy (second photo from the bottom in my album), probably because I stopped working out and started eating a lot of fatty foods. Well, during my trip this asshole guy called me fat, and although I knew I wasn't fat, that experience made me face the fact that I was gaining weight again. 

Now, but at the end of the day, the weight doesn't matter much to me. I just want to look fit and feel good!

I hope I inspired a few people to be more confident if nothing else, dealing with a few bashers was worth it if I helped anyone at all.

So 60 days ago I finally thought enough is enough. I was at 253lbs when I began (my heaviest weight yet) and started by joining a gym. Once I'd paid for the gym my mentality was there is no turning back - as a student, haha! 
But ultimately


So I began at 253lbs (115kg) and 60 days later I am at 220lbs (100kg) and I get a bit overwhelmed at my progress as I never *ever* thought I could do this. 
I go to the gym 3/4 days a week for a bit of cardio (only about 40 minutes a session); brisk walking uphill
I have pretty much cut out any sugary soft drinks (or any higher calorie drinks like juices), crisps, cheese, sweets, chips etc - all the regular culprits. I do give myself treats but I'd like to think I'm quite sensible about things; low cal crisps like Walkers baked, I do treat myself to chocolate (often Kitkats), when I fancy something with cheese etc I will use low fat versions, oil spray when cooking etc. One of my biggest weaknesses is Mexican food so I replace anything tortilla based with the huge lettuce leaves to wrap my food in/scoop up - maybe a bit odd haha
But the most amazing thing I've found is I actually **love** this new exercise regime and lighter food lifestyle; I'm really enjoying this journey, lighter ways and it's a fun challenge.

It is difficult at times

My method was calorie counting and working out.  I trained pretty hardcore 4-5 days a week last summer for the Chicago Triathlon

Earlier in the summer I was playing softball several times a week, meaning I just had to get knee surgery a week ago.  It's been frustrating being laid up, but after plateauing for most of the past winter and spring, it has actually caused me to focus on my diet and eating a lot more, as well as my upper body and core.

My advice to people just beginning their journey would be to make sure to include weight lifting in your routine, lift heavy! Don't worry about getting bulky because it's not very possible without the use of steroids. I literally, until I took today's progress pictures and measurements, had no idea of the hourglass figure I was developing. Largely thanks to lifting heavy at the gym, with about 20-30 minutes of cardio at the end of my workouts.

Aside from the physical changes, so I recommend that to anyone looking to get back out into the dating world as well!

In highschool my friends and I would have sleepovers where we ate pizza and chips

In my first year of university, especially because my boyfriend had a six-pack and was in perfect shape.

Second year university, I lost 7lbs. However, this year, I decided to keep it off. I started counting calories with loseit.com on November 18th and since then I've lost another 13lbs.

**My Diet:**

I've always loved to cook

For Breakfast

For Lunch I have either Campbell's Garden Tomato Soup (and I add my own frozen corn) with celery and carrots

Dinner I eat whatever me and my boyfriend (Gus) want, Chili,  Chicken Souvlaki and Pesto Pasta. I always make lower calorie versions of these foods, but keep the taste the same.

For Snacks, Jello or Celery with Soy Butter.

Recently

**Exercise**

I've been slacking a bit with exercise lately

I've gotten here by hard work

My story is like many others. I have been overweight for a large portion of my life. In high school I weighed 200lbs and from there it continued to creep up over the years. In college my weight skyrocketed to 300lbs after I began medication after medication for my generalized anxiety disorder, couch bum.  (I have learned to cope with my anxiety on my own through breathing techniques and relaxation because I can't stand what the meds do to me) 

Go ahead to just 3 years ago and I was 310lbs and I got pregnant. I was excited but shit

Then, I was at work and I started getting this weird tingling sensation in my chest. I didn't think much of it at first but then it intensified. I finally went to a urgent treatment center and one ambulance ride later to the hospital and who knows how many tests later I was NOT having a heart attack, but I got one big fucking WAKE UP CALL! 

Sometimes I get mad with myself that it wasn't having a kid or getting over 300lbs that made me get off my ass but thinking that at 32 I was having a heart attack that did

I track my calories religiously. Whether I am over or not. And if I go over

Here's to the next 71lbs and to reaching my GW of 175lbs!

Started 246. Now 171 (and falling). Feel free to ask questions!

Well

I'm a 24 year old (about 5' 11.5"") who works in the web which means sitting at my desk most of the day. Some days I work from home which only means I move even less. My weight started creeping up on me in high school (around 190), I was at 246.6 pounds. I don't even think that was my heaviest, thats just when I decided to start tracking.

I tried a *ton* of diets (slow carb, a lot of times, I'm stuck eating airport food. I needed a way to make healthy choices on the go and at home.

My wife actually introduced me to [""The Best Life Diet""](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Life-Diet-Revised-Updated/dp/B002PJ4I52/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325511829&amp;sr=8-1) which changed my life. This isn't so much as a diet as it is a set of simple rules and phases to eeeaassee you into a healthier diet. The tips and tricks are essentially what Reddit has been saying for quiet some time but I think one of the biggest tips is **make small changes that you can keep but then add onto those changes as you**. You won't be successful if you try to deprive yourself of EVERYTHING you once loved.

The book eases you in through three phases. I followed Phase 1 exactly

I only dieted for about three months before I got into running. At first, nowadays, I need to run at a pretty fast clip (for me) to get my heart where it used to be. I know cardio isn't for everyone but I loved running because it gave me goals that were personal: my race times I was competing against myself. I've since run a half marathon and am looking to run 3 or 4 more half marathons this year and a full in October. *But let me be clear:* I run that much because I actually enjoy running. For weight loss, you don't need to do the amount of running I do (30+ miles per week).

Most recently, its something I'm uncomfortable starting without being taught. I've done a few simple routines on my own (and given by my running coach) but recently found [DailyBurn](http://www.dailyburn.com). I love their routines and found them great for me. Another great site is [BodyRockTV](http://www.bodyrock.tv/). There are tons of options for you to start, but again, you have to pick something that you want to do! I've tried a few of the P90X (and etc) programs and for me, I don't get really excited about it. They seem like sooo much work for the goal of ""GETTING RIPPPPEED"". Do I want to look hot on the beach? Hell yes. But I need something that I'm not going to scoff to do every day. YMMV.

Now, burn a little more, and more lifestyle choices.

I have about 8 lbs left to go (give or take) before reaching my original ""racing weight"" goal for running. That'll likely go just a little lower to get my body fat under control. I don't have all the answers

tl;dr.

* Choose a healthy diet that you can do for the rest of your life. Lean meats, whole grains. Boom, done.
* Pick a physical activity you enjoy and just kill it. For me: Running. For you: pick something you're excited about.
* Augment your ""chosen"" physical activity with its compliment. (Mainly weights: add a little cardio. Mainly cardio: add a little weights.)",,t5_2rz8w,False,,75lbs,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/nzrlx/i_lost_75_pounds_and_got_way_healthier_photoshow/

It's been a while since I posted on here, and now I want to help support a good cause.  If my story can inspire even one person, I'll have felt accomplished.  

This is my page
http://main.diabetes.org/goto/dominathan

&gt;I have been overweight my entire life.  

&gt;My entire family was above the overweight line, way over the obese body fat percentage.  My maternal grandfather and one of my great-grandmothers were also diagnosed, but they passed before I was born.  Both of my grandmothers were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, both of whom I watched suffer until they both passed away from unrelated causes. I knew diabetes was a possibility for me, and honestly, I was sick of being limited to what I could do because of my size.

&gt;One of the biggest epiphanies for me was watching the documentary, it really made me want to change.  I started eating foods without HFCS, and I stopped drinking soda, but I wanted to do more.  I have always hated running, but I knew I needed to do it.  I started a RunKeeper account to track my progress, and little by little, I watched those times get faster.  I made it a challenge to myself, you'll do everything you can.  I was doing it for me, to be 200lbs.  I was really busy with my last semester of University, and I just couldn't do it anymore.  I stopped in December

&gt;This was my third attempt at losing the weight.  The first two times, so if I wanted to have it, I had to learn to portion.  I knew if this was going to stick, I'd have to have a lifestyle change.  By May, I was 225lbs.

&gt;I first started walking around the path behind my work, 1.5 miles.  In August, it was going to be one year since I started doing it, and I wanted to meet my goal.  I had 2 months to loose 20lbs, so I had to ramp up my efforts.  I knew I lived fairly close to work, so I decided to start biking to work.  

&gt;I bought a used hybrid bike online the last weekend of June, but otherwise I was fine.  I didn't bike that Monday, but I did the rest of that week.  I biked almost every single day, tracking my progress just like my runs.  Everyday I pushed myself harder, and I saw my route times get shorter, and my top speeds get faster.  Then, in the first week of August, but I didn't want to stop.  The lowest I had been since puberty was 177, so I said I'm ""finished"" with losing weight when I could see a 6-pack. As I looked at myself in the mirror

&gt;I couldn't recognize myself at all.  In my head, I felt more agile, quick, and responsive.  I had no idea what my body was capable of. 

&gt;By December, sprained, hit by a car, hit by another bike, and had my friend's bike break in two right under me.  Even with all of this, I kept going, but as the holidays kicked in, and just enjoyed myself.  I wasn't biking, and leg lifts.  I did as many reps as I could

&gt;As the new year started, and now that I finally feel like I'm done losing weight, I want to push myself to see what I'm capable of.  I've never done anything of this magnitude my entire life, but if I even help one person, I will feel complete.  I want to help people, inspire them, let them know they really do have the power to change anything.  If there was one thing I learned throughout this journey, you can accomplish anything.  Now I was to see what I can accomplish

EDIT2:  I've read a lot of comments from LoseIt (in general) that losing weight is 80% diet, but I still wanted to enjoy great food.  The first step was eliminating **high fructose corn syrup**.  It's EVERYWHERE, seriously.  Bread, peanut butter, you name it!  This, however, made most of my shopping more expensive.  Honestly, too.  This also eliminated most fast food, chik-fil-a (not fried!).

[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/cDRiD.jpg) is our progress!  The first picture was taken two years ago on my birthday (I am on the left in both pictures).  The second picture was taken this past weekend.

**Our stats:**  I am 5'4"" and 23 years old; I started at 170(ish) lbs and am now 128(ish) lbs.  My ultimate goal weight range is 118-120 lbs and/or to have a flat tummy.  She is 5'2"" and 24 years old; she started at 210 lbs and is now 155 lbs.  I'm not sure what her ultimate goal is

**How we did it:**  I started Weight Watchers last August on a whim because I had seen some of my friends on Facebook have success with it, but I have been consistently lifting (Starting Strength) for about a month now and love it.

Nearly a year ago, it was like I gained 1 lb every month for 9 years. It's funny how it can sneak up on you with something as simple as 1 lb per month.

My real inspiration was my daughter. She was about to be 7-months-old

I started working out on April 25, which was only 6 months away. It meant that I needed to lose 2.5-3 lbs a week, which seemed impossible...yet somehow doable.

I started working out. I completely changed my diet. I was relentless about working out and eating right. It was a complete life change. The toughest part was the diet. I was addicted to sweet drinks. But all the hard work paid off and I hit my goal of losing 80 lbs in 6 months.

So I started running a little game on her and got the digits.

So... my [mum](http://i.imgur.com/2QChGBJ.jpg) being a health buff, but i still eat really sinful food... til i went for Wendy's for a postworkout meal.

As it turned out, dehydrated. Went for a checkup and the doctor said it was lucky i was still alive... and dont you know it, i got sexier! lol

I still go for workouts now and then after that. I still dont have a strict diet and I still kept on eating donuts and cake. Until a new physical trainer started to work in the gym. She's a marathoner too. So i had this crush and she invited me to a couple of [runs](http://i.imgur.com/gDF6Faq.jpg). I decided to follow her even i had asthma. After that heart-broken but I still decided to continue running even i ate a bucket of ice-cream.

I dont tend to watch my weight. I dont care how i look, jolly. Til my usual checkup need to know my weight. My doctor was surprised too with all the change i made... She said I lost 80lbs since the food poisoning incident...

...80lbs... wait... my mum made a wager! and i forgot.

End story, usual runs in the morning. As for diet, i dont do it. its like Die with a +. I dont intake protein shakes, or any supplement. Just my normal multivitamins and thats all. I still eat like a Filipino, or any other asian... lots of rice. It stresses me out to keep track at everything i eat. I still pig out, hence the cake... now im with the British Dragonboat team here in Singapore coz i feel i want some new sport not involving buying another set of shoes.

The very next day I was at the gym signing up for a years subscription and booking in 3 personal trainer sessions. Within just a couple of weeks I had seen results and that motivated me even more to get off my ass and make a real effort to do it. The other thing that helped me through this was having a gym buddy. A really good friend who switched gyms and was loosing weight as well. Because there was some one waiting for me to meet them and go to the gym I felt that I had to go in order to not let them down.

One day in early 2011 we challenged each other to jog from about half way between our houses and the gym to the front door of the gym. It killed us. More than the workouts we had done up to that point so we decided that we would start running. Picked up the Couch to 5K program and went from there. After successfully completing our first 5k in May 2011 we decided to keep it going and progressed to 10k and a half marathon in 2012.

In 2012 I decided to leave the gym and go fully in to running. Joined a local club and started to make massive leaps in to improvements on speed and distance. My gym buddy at that time went more in to weight training. However we both agreed to try and complete a marathon. I had applied for the lottery that is London but my buddy had missed to cut off so we decided to look else where. Rome was the marathon we ended up agreeing on and on 17th March 2013 we both very proudly completed that marathon. Today I weigh in at 208 lbs.

The weight loss hasn't been easy though. There were cheat days that turned in to weeks / months. There were times when I felt like giving up and just admitting I was a failure. But those days always passed as the thought of going back to that hill and being in the same situation that started this whole journey was enough to snap me out of whatever state of mind I was in.

Here is the before and after pic:

[http://imgur.com/c3U7gEF](http://imgur.com/c3U7gEF)

Key things that helped me get here:

* Having set goals
* Changed my diet big style
* Don't worry about about bad days
* Have some one to work towards your goals with (this has been the biggest motivator for me)

- Weightlifting! I found an example weightlifting routine on Reddit and each week focus on increasing weights and my strength. I now go 5-6 days a week.  
- I ask a lot of questions and I research a lot to better understand the science behind nutrition and working out. 
- I've made friends at the gym that give great advice and really help motivate me.

**EDIT:** I've received quite a few messages from Redditors wanting to learn more about my measurements

* *Before pics:* http://imgur.com/UtZPwTC
* *Nutrition:* Week 1 started at 1300 calories but now that I've been lifting I've increased my calories to 1700 calories at Week 4. My macro breakdown is 40% Carbs / 35% Protein / 25% Fat (I track what I eat on MyFitnessPal). I drink about ~12 cups of water every day. I take a Multivitamin
* *Workout:* I go to the gym 5-6x a week and am using a routine I found on Reddit (http://redd.it/1ik9os). I do a Pull/Push/Legs split Monday thru Saturday and take Sunday as my rest day. I try to increase my weights every week. I spend no more than an hour at the gym each day and try to stay focused on getting through my workout in that time. I alternate doing HIIT cardio called Tabata on a stationary bike (about 5 minutes of HIIT and another 10-15mins of regular cardio on the bike)
* *My motivation:* Tired of being overweight
* *What's next:* My biggest goal is to continue eating right and hitting the gym longer than 6 months and turning this routine into a lifestyle. I just hit the 42 day mark (so I still have quite a bit to go). Reddit has helped a lot with keeping up my motivation - so thank you!
 
* *Important to note:* I had no idea how to get started but each week kept researching

I cannot stress enough -- **counting calories really worked for me**. I had attempted so many vague weight loss efforts before, going to all sorts of classes at the gym, but all failed. When I first cut to 1200 calories a day, I still felt hungry sometimes, especially at night, but honestly, within a week, much

I counted calories using [LoseIt](http://www.loseit.com/) for the first couple of months, I still lost weight, although at a slower pace, I think because I was biking every day and sometimes got really busy and did things like only eat almonds for lunch. I also ate a bunch of bread :( but the calorie balance must have been in the negative. I walk a fair amount and bike, though less so now that it has gotten cold, but I haven't stuck with any regular exercise for its own sake. 

I haven't followed any particular diet, fajitas, roasted vegetables like kale and broccoli, soup, meatballs, salads, pizza, I can pretty much eat anything

My original goal was 145lbs because it put me in the normal BMI range. Now that I've reached that goal

I think a big part of my success this time has been getting rid of some negative thought patterns I had. I used to eat more because I was worried about getting hungry later. I would eat mindlessly, they became more and more automatic, and I learned that I could wait the negative thoughts out, maybe go to bed a little hungry, but wake up feeling fine in the morning.

I started late November at 245 (my highest recorded

I used to be the guy who would literally eat chips everyday, so I wasn't really picked on but I still wasn't happy).

I plan on getting to 175 pounds and start muscle training from there!

What I'm basically saying is that if I can do it, or big you are: you can do it!

EDIT: Some seem interested

First and foremost

I cut out all pop (what we Michiganders call soda) from my diet and currently only drink diet pop or zero calorie liquids including plenty of water. No point in drinking your calories when you could be eating them.

I ate chips literally everyday. I would buy the $4 bags and eat those in 1-2 days then go get more. I completely 100% cut chips out of my life. Not just chips either. All fast food has also been cut out completely.

I would only eat out at restaurants when I was with lady friends.

I never allowed myself a ""cheat day"" or ""cheat meal."" I think those are bullshit. What I do is eat what I want

I mainly ate foods with protein and good fats while significantly decreasing carbs. It's not exactly keto

I found that I have a high tolerance to hunger pangs

While not exercising religiously, hockey, tennis, and racquetball.

If you are anything like I was when I was obese, during my senior year, all that has changed. I'm very confident and happy with who I am (even though I have more weight to lose). The first key to success is confidence that you can succeed.

IMPORTANT: I am getting all my essential vitamins and nutrients. I know how important those are so I make sure I get them.

For motivation: 

* It seems tough to keep motivated when it seems like the scale tells you that your weight is lower while you feel like you look the same. I unfortunately did not take pictures

* I find not eating unhealthy food very easy. I realized that willpower doesn't exist. People do what they want to do,,False,,t5_2rz8w,True,,True

What I did to lose the weight:
Completely eliminated every soft drink. Used to drink coke + various other sodas almost every day. Now I just drink water

No more fast food. Again

Junk food, chips, cookies etc from time to time but not nearly as much as before. Was a daily thing before now I actually eat them as treats from time to time.

Besides cutting out the obvious junk

Exercising:
Probably the effective thing I've done was to purchase an exercising bike. I was too embarrassed to go to the gym so I bought a bike and started using it for 20mins

At first it was difficult, then I'd make an attempt at it and fail. The turning point for me I think was buying the  bike and committing to actually exercising. Once I started seeing results, 2, 3, 4 lbs lost it kinda just had a snow ball effect from there and I haven't looked back. Not to mention putting in all that effort on the bike really motivated me to not eat anymore garbage because I did not want to waste that time I spent on it.

I also try to be much more active, just went kayaking. Gets in some exercise and is a lot more fun than sitting on a bike for an hour!

My goal is to reach 180lbs and then I'll see if I want to go lower from there.

After lurking here for a while and seeing all the amazing and inspiring progress posts, as a science nerd: I researched that shit. I read and bought so many books about how to lose weight, it was ridiculous. And it paid off.


**My stats from December 2006 to my 21st Birthday in June 2007:**


* Height: 5’11”
* Weight: 245 to 135 / 140 lbs
* Woman’s pant size: 18 to 4
* Shirt Size: Large to Small


Progress photos from 2006 to today: [Before and After photos here](http://imgur.com/a/JIb5O)


**What I did:** I counted calories; so, so I wrote everything down on post-its and in a weekly / daily organizer. I told myself that I needed to be honest with myself, so I made sure I accounted for everything. And honestly, lying to myself had only got me into size 18 pants.  After I had lost about 30 lbs I felt more comfortable going to the gym. I would go for about an hour and a half, four to five days a week, doing mostly cardio, treadmill and elliptical, filled up on veggies

Over the past year I have gained back 35 lbs. It is difficult knowing that I put so much effort into loosing 105 lbs to have gained some of it back but

**Height:** 6'0"" (about 183 cm)

**Goal weight:** 200 lbs (90.7 kg)

**Shirt size:** Down from 4XL to XL

**Pant size:** Down from 48"" waist to 38""


All this was done through simply restricting calories and lots of running. When I began, but after educating myself on just how dangerous that can be (especially with all the running I've been doing), I slowly upped my daily intake to 1,500-1,800 calories. I still shed about two to three pounds a week, and I'm not practically starving myself anymore, so all's well. As for specifics on what I eat... I'm not too terribly picky. I avoid basically all sweets like the plague due to their calorie density and being generally unhealthy, but apart from that


As for exercise... running, I was absolutely awful at it; 50-second jogs followed by two-minute rests were all my out-of-shape ass could handle, but nowadays I can run a 5K with relative comfort. My progress in running has come in leaps and bounds, and now that I'm decent at it, I can't get enough of it. It feels wonderful to be physically active after being the epitome of the complete opposite for my entire life. I've recently started adopting various body weight workouts - mainly upper body, as I'd love to be able to do a pull-up some day - so hopefully I can gain some muscle to fill the void that loose skin is bound to occupy when I reach my goal weight.

Backstory
Through high school, but wasn’t bothered enough to do much either.

Then I was in a car accident on Christmas Day 2011 (not my fault, and couch-bound after leaving the hospital. The first couple of days sucked, but then things started healing (although my collarbone still gives me trouble sometimes). It was amazing how quickly my body started healing, despite the terrible health I had been keeping it in. I felt bad. If I could heal this well while being obese, what could I and my body do if I got myself in shape? 

My boyfriend introduced me to reddit while I was stuck on the couch, but I feel fabulous and look much better. 

My Diet: I use MFP. I set myself to sedentary and to lose 1 pound a week, stopped buying Oreos, and started measuring my food on a scale. I eat a lot of fruit, veggies, chicken, and whole grains. I get a ton of healthy recipes online, so I’m never bored! 

Exercise: I work out for 30-60 minutes four to five times a week on average. I started with c25k a couple of months in, I use a Polar FT4 heart rate monitor, so I can more accurately guess how many calories I burn working out. 

TL;DR: I eat less

When I started losing weight, tried to keep my intake around the 1200-1300 range. I joined a gym and started doing the elliptical and treadmill for 20-30 minutes and randomly using the weight machines, with no real plan in mind. After losing about 10 lbs (4.5 kg), I started the Couch to 5k program on the treadmill at the gym. I continued to throw in sporadic and random use of the weight machines, doing high reps with low weights.
I lost about 2 lbs/week (~1 kg/week)for a while and in November 2011, but without any real rhyme or reason. During the holidays, my eating was not the best, and I just maintained my weight until January, when I decided to put a concerted effort into losing more weight. At this point, I started obsessively tracking calories again and started losing weight again. Around 165 lbs (75 kg), my weight loss slowed, and got my weight down to 155 lbs (70 kg). My workouts predictably suffered, I gained back about 15 lbs (6.8 kg). He then told me that I needed to start lifting weights. He turned me onto Starting Strength about 4 months ago

My weight now fluctuates between 161-165 lbs (73-75 kg) and has been in that range for the last 3 months. 

About a month ago, REALLY like the intermittent fasting part of it. I eat from 12pm-10pm. I am having a little bit of trouble keeping up with my macros and have lost some motivation to track my calories. I am really kind of looking for some added accountability/friends in r/loseit so that I can regain some of my previous determination. I'm focusing on strength now, but I'd also still like to lose about 15 lbs (6.8 kg).

Hi all! In 2011 I was almost 400lbs, not to mention constant back pain and unable to walk a flight of steps without getting winded. My mother passed away about ten years ago at 47 so I also knew there was medical history. Something this time scared me to death, and I slowly started walking. Soon after I found Couch to 5K... from there it snowballed... 10K, 1/2 marathon, marathon, and then triathlons. This past November I obtained the title of Ironman.

If you stick around there are pictures at the end!


**Health background:** It feels as if all my life I was was always bigger, huge pimples that would happen on my chin line, and I was always depressed. It wasn't until I was 18 that I was diagnosed with [Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.](http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.cfm#d) Which causes insulin resistance issues and leading to excessive weight gain or obesity especially in the waist area. My doctor prescribed me the diabetic medication Metformin to help level my insulin and hopefully stop the weight gain. Staying on Metformin was really hard for me to do my senior year of high school and into college, it caused a lot of stomach issues and I was terrible at taking pills everyday. It leveled out the weight gain but I couldn't seem to lose any of it.


It was finally in April 2011 when I moved into my first apartment that I decided I needed to take control of my weight starting with buying better food for myself, bike riding, running around with (and for) the kids. One of my biggest influences and support systems throughout my weight journey is my boyfriend. Before we started dating he lost 70 lbs and gave me great advice and support. I probably couldn't have done it without him.


**Eating:** First off I installed the MyFitnessPal on my phone to keep track of my calories. As being hired as a full time nanny I could pretty much eat whatever and whenever I wanted. It was hard in the beginning to not snack with the kids whenever I was making them something, but obviously wouldn't be eating pizza or obviously bad food. 


**Exercise:** My main concern is usually cardio to get my heart rate up, basically low blood pressure. If I get my heart rate too high, I pass out. I usually go for about a mile and then take a break for a little while so I don't face plant in the middle of the gym. 


Other than those things I just really tried to remain active, buying a bike, and mostly sticking to my meal plans and medication. 


I know there are lots of women out there with PCOS and hopefully this could be some inspiration for some of them


**Pictures:** I don't have any pictures from the beginning in April

So, with a weight approaching 200 lbs (90.7 kg) at a height of 5'7"" (170.18 cm). I was a SAP (socially awkward penguin) and really never had a girlfriend through High School.

I'm not sure what was going through my head at this point. I would look in the mirror and see a fat kid, a miniscule amount of protein and almost no fruits or veggies. I would eat fast food about once a week. It was sad.

What would it take for me to get my fat ass in gear? Would I have to wait for diabetes to hit? Heart disease? I was headed down this road

One day during the summer after my sophomore year in HS, the card was eerily appropriate for my situation. I was fighting a self-inflicted disease.

The card also had a key fob in it. It turns out my Mother went and signed me up to the YMCA gym about 5 minutes from my house. This was all the motivation I needed.

I went to that gym 3-4 days a week. I would perform an effective mixture of weight training and cardio, bought fat free milk for my new cereals, ate more vegetables and fruits (bananas and spinach salad mostly). This all proved very effective. 

I was down to 170 lbs in about 10 months and felt AMAZING. Seriously, and I knew I couldn't let myself lose any of my motivation.

I began to step up my cardio (running, I knew I had taken a complete 180-degree turn for the better.

Currently, I've cut out most drinks other than coffee/water/skim milk and when I *do* cheat, it's that much more amazing :D I'm still a bit of a SAP. I'm shy, but I'm forcing myself to do things outside of my comfort zone socially.

LoseIt has helped me so much to keep the weight off. Though I didn't join until about 6 months ago

**340-&gt;275:** Started Paleo, 2 days a week, and 2-3 days on my own doing other cardio activities (I'm picking up cycling now and do 60-120 minute rides a couple of times a week)

I currently do some type of activity about 3-5 days per week


I plan on maintaining the diet and slowly adding more physical activity, at 10-12% bodyfat.


I work a lot currently so it's very challenging to find time for healthy activity

I was always the fat kid, fired from my job, I was incredibly lonely and I was starting to think maybe I should give up on life.

I was 215 and in pretty good shape years ago ( http://i.imgur.com/IAxHy.jpg ). I lifted every day

Jump ahead a few years and I feel like crud

It's not easy at first but it starts to work. We fall in love with the Les Mills line of classes, BODYATTACK, and BODYCOMBAT become regular activities for us and they start to really make the change happen. Eventually I am down to 230lb but the bigger thing than lbs is I'm down from a snug fitting size 40 pants to a loose fitting size 36, so although I've only lost 60lbs at this point, I've put on a decent amount of muscle, and shed inches of fat. I take up teaching BODYCOMBAT at this point as I'm feeling decent in my fitness, but I am not done with my own transformation. A year later I start teaching BODYPUMP and I'm still working on my body

Here's me at 230lbs doing my first Warrior Dash http://i.imgur.com/EI0Rh.jpg (yeah flames)

So now I've gone another year and another 35lbs down and I feel amazingly better. I can do so much more. I've completed a half marathon, although I do eat a lot of chicken...

Here is me now, and still not comfortable with now, but I'm working on it.

***TL;DR I was 290lbs and now I am 195lb so close to 100lbs loss.

**
Diet info:** 

When I was packing on the weight, Tuna Helper, and a lot of other disgusting stuff. Really, what the heck was I thinking with that food. 

When I went to lose weight, Cake, Cookies and more..Pizza..for sure Pizza..because I WILL NOT give up Pizza. 

I didn't have a huge soda habit or anything but I did start to include a lot more water


For my final surge of 30lbs in the last 6-8 months it's been a lot of chicken constantly throughout the day. I ate 7-8 times a day about 3-4oz of chicken

I utilized the crap out of MyFitnessPal.com for calorie counting during this time too. This was to do a major calorie check and make sure I was only eating what I really needed to eat. I teach or take class two times a day some days so I used my fitness pal to log calories burned and calories taken in to make sure I wasn't putting my body into a state of shock from burning 1200 calories that day exercising plus the 2000 calories I naturally burn with BMR. It's important to fuel the body or it starts to eat muscle and causes a lot of not so great results.

Right now for maintenance I eat typically 4 meals a day

My daily intake look like this right now:

* Breakfast:
Blueberry &amp; Strawberry Protein Smoothie with Vanilla Soy Milk (I toss in a handful of frozen strawberries and half a cup of blueberries and about 1.5 cups of Soy Mil and one scoop of whey protein)

* Lunch 1: Chicken 4oz

* Lunch 2: Chicken 4oz &amp; Carbs of some sort (Rice {typically brown}

* Dinner: Varies greatly... Steak, Seafood, You name it. Dinner is not a meal I watch that heavily, but I am still careful for the most part. It's the one meal I get to enjoy with my wife in the day so we don't really put a huge limit on what we eat for dinner, we try and keep it simple with protein and a veggie source but other days it's Pizza delivery, or out for Sushi, or out for Wings and Beer. Depends on the day.







*Additional info: My wife is doing great on her fitness journey as well. She's done three half marathons..to my one..she's an overachiever.. She just recently certified to teach BODYCOMBAT as well and she is feeling and looking great. It's been an awesome journey together. I don't know her total weight loss though. *

Before I get to the rest of my post, and it took me approximately 1.5 to 2 years to lose this much weight so far, thanks for the questions! And sorry for removing pix, had some harassment/had to report some people. I just wanted to help encourage everyone, not get trouble! ;p hopefully the tips can still help someone.

Now to let you know how I got there and how I've made changes. Don't get me wrong, my troubles finally max'd out mid twenties from a culmination of undiagnosed ADD, Anxiety Disorder and of course plain misuse of food. I would eat to cope with my life, as many people do, but one day I just realized that I was in charge of my own happiness and my own health—that I wasn't stuck.

How did I do it specifically? I started slow. I had bad experiences in high school of trying to always find the “next big diet” hoping it would work for me, plain and simple, and sticking to it. The easy first steps that I followed: 

1. **Buy healthy groceries and cook at home!** - Everyone has different eating preferences (+ I am not a nutritionist). But in my opinion, some fruits and avoid too many complex carbs (like pastas, breads, etc). I personally chose to also cut out wheat (I use alternative flours when necessary) and I do not take in sugary foods/drinks. An example of a meal I would eat for dinner would be baked fish (or a lettuce wrapped lean turkey burger) with a large serving of vegetables and a quarter cup wild organic rice. I usually eat smaller meals and 2 snacks per day, keeping them about 3 hours apart to have my metabolism always running strong.

2. **Move!** - Let me be the first to tell you...I don't like exercising. At all. Lol. Some people say it gets better or that they start to love it, in the beginning, I just made myself walk the treadmill at my house(or walk your block if you don't have one). I just walked at a decent pace for a mere 15 minutes a day when I started. That is not much at all, but eventually I was able to jog at an incline for 45 minutes, and as months went by I started adding in weights and calisthenics! It just takes time and perseverance. My advice is start with whatever you can, even if you can't afford a gym. Just....move! ;p

**Special Tip**: The dreaded “cheat days”. Having the idea of cheating is a poor mindset for your health. You are building a lifestyle, or if you have a party at your house, give the leftovers away to someone or throw them out after. There is no such thing as messing up your whole diet, you just eat healthy/exercise or you don't. Just always keep on moving, if you eat bad, fix it for the rest of the day. Forgive yourself ;p Health is forever not just about whether you screw up or not. Besides, healthy foods can be good too.

Bonus Recipe: This is one of my favorites that I created. You can sub in any veggies you want!

**Low sodium veggie turkey stir-fry** (this makes *at least* 3-4 servings. Choose wisely according to your personal eating plan)

- 1 whole zucchini (sliced or chopped)
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1 can bamboo shoots (drained/rinsed and sliced)
- 1 small package of extra lean ground turkey
- 1 cup chopped red peppers (can sub with green peppers if desired)
- spices (pepper, onion flakes, red pepper flakes if you like spicy etc)
- light virgin olive oil (or cooking spray) to prep the pans

Start by washing and cutting up all your vegetables. You will need two pans typically, once again *lightly* oil the pan for the vegetables (some healthy fats are important, but never go overboard). Add your vegetables over a medium fire and start spicing things up (I choose to add spices to both the veggies and meat so that they marinate in them separately over time instead of blanketing spice on afterward). The low sodium part of this recipe is about choosing natural spices that do not include salt :) I find they taste just as delicious without it, but if you feel you need something like salt, please choose a more natural route like sea salt and be sparing with it. Drain the meat when it is done cooking. When both are at your desired consistency (usually the veggies are soft enough to eat but still have a slight crisp, and the meat has no pink), you will combine them together. Stir them, don't be shy with the shaker (my favorite is garlic!) ;p Add to taste.

Wellll. I suppose this post is long enough with all my ramblings :) I've always had problems being concise ;p For those who stuck with it and read it, photos or tips. Never give up (I'm still working at it too!) Good luck all!

There is just something about being so depressed, I couldn't hold back the anger and frustration burning inside of me. I started crying, looking at myself in the rear-view mirror then looking at the gastric bypass pamphlet sitting on the seat next to me. I fucking hated myself. 

At about that same time I had just discovered Reddit, they were not selling anything and they had nothing to gain (other than karma). They were just everyday average people that proved that it could in fact be done. This was more inspiration than anything I had ever seen. 

So I started the South Beach diet and left that doctor who wanted me to get surgery. I also joined a gym and threw out all the bad food I had in my house. The transformation took a long time

This is something that I have struggled with and tried to understand for the past decade. Fighting for better health is something that doesn't come easily and the results are not instant, I know for a fact you can.

I am only 10 lbs away from my original goal of 155 lbs as of right now!!



How I did it:  I started with low cal/low fat diet change when I first started, along w/a couple of 30 to 40 min cardio sessions a week.  I would do a little bit of weight training with my husband so that I could try to tighten and tone as I was losing, but I hated every second of it.  Then in September of 2011, after losing abt 45 to 50 lbs, I fell off of the wagon so to speak.  Life got in the way. Had Kids that were in football and cheerleading so I never could find the time to get to the gym. Let's face it, I didn't even try to find the time.  I had an excuse to not have to go.  I went back to eating exactly the same as before and from September to December, ended up gaining 15lbs back. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, going to one class (Dance Fit) a week and still a little cardio.  By the 3rd week of January

I have also discovered a love for heavy weightlifting.  My husband and I are now in the gym 6 days a week in some form or fashion 
By the way
Squats : 225lbs
Deadlifts: 240lbs
Bench: 135lbs

I don't know which I love more

As far as my diet goes since getting back in the gym, I LOVE carbs and I am not a happy person w/o them.  

TL;DR- I love lifting. I love running. I love carbs. Lost 65 pounds. Thanks Lose-It.

I played sports and went out as much as the other kids up until 13 or so.  Then I got way too into video games and that slowed me down quite a bit.  I think by senior year of high school I finally said ""fuck it"" and figured if I'm gonna be fat either way I'm going to eat what I want and be a real fatty. [Senior prom](http://i.imgur.com/ufbSMpY.jpg?1).

At my heaviest I was 365.  Possibly a bit more.  At this point my self loathing was pretty substantial. [This is one of the pictures I have where you can see how big I was](http://i.imgur.com/zt9aj.jpg) I was 20 at this time. 8 months ago I started eating non-fat Fage yogurt with mixed berries, and almonds for breakfast everyday.  Over 2 months I think I lost 15-20 pounds.  This is without doing any real exercise.  I didn't really notice myself losing weight.  It wasn't until I was weighed at the doctors that I realized I'd lost weight.  

This was a pretty substantial moment for me.  I can't EVER remember stepping on the scale and having it go down that much from the last time I weighed myself.  This was a pretty big motivator for me.  I bought myself a pair of walking shoes and started doing between a mile or two a day.  Occasionally jogging once it became easier.  I started drinking a gallon of water a day and paying more attention to how much I was eating.  I still allowed myself to eat what I wanted.  Just in civilized portions and not after 9 pm.   

I started to see the weight come off.  Slowly but surely.  Don't get me wrong

Fast forward a bit

 My favorite thing about this weight loss is the clothes.  It is SUCH A GOOD FEELING to be able to purchase clothes for *normal* stores.  I used to be a 3XL and a 44 waist.  Currently I'm a L/XL and a 38 waist.  I could never just walk in and find clothes before.  I have so many more options now and I love it.  The only issue I still have is running into clothing too short for me (I'm 6'5).  [This is me on Christmas](http://i.imgur.com/CUaKK.jpg). 

If you actually took the time to read this long ass post I thank you.  I apologize for any typos or anything that doesn't make sense. I'm semi rushing this since I want to get to sleep for work in the morning.  Just wanted to get it out there before I forgot.  My goal weight is somewhere between 220-240.  Lifting seems like the next logical step for me.  I want to stay big

TL;DR: I was fat

EDIT: I would just like to say thank you to everyone for your kind words and encouragement.  You have no idea how great you've made me feel about my progress so far.

1374768393.0,1j18wf,I'm 26 Year Old Male and I'm 420 lbs. Someone PLEASE Help Me. I'm Really Afraid.,mrandmrsmartino,551,92,201,"I don't really know where to start. I'll just give a basic overview of why I've come here seeking help. I have always been big. I never really felt there was any problem with my eating habit or exercise regimen (or lack there of.) I played football so I was okay with being big. Now that I've been out of high school roughly 10 years I've packed on so much weight. I finally decided a couple years ago that It was time to do something about my weight for a couple reasons. I found out I was having a baby and I was finally able to find a scale that could weigh me and I tipped the scales at 450 lbs. 

I started a smattering of diets and exercises. First I just got my calorie intake down to 2000 daily. I started logging my calories and realized I was taking in 5-6 THOUSAND calories DAILY! So I dropped down to 2000 and dropped roughly 30 lbs. When I plateaued from that, off day, lower body and cardio, off day, cardio, off day, off day. from that and keeping my diet below 2k cals I lost another 35 lbs. I was down 95 lbs and feeling great. I went to the doctor and he was telling me that I was doing well but if I wanted to lose more I had to burn more calories than I was taking in. so I set a goal for myself to take in only 1500 calories a day and burn 2000. I also changed my diet to clean eating, no white rice

The same thing that has always happened any time I said I was going to try to lose some weight. I just turned off. I don't know if I got bored or what, commute 1.5 hours to work, work my 9 hours, then commute another 1.5 hours home. by the time I get home I don't want to go grocery shopping or go to the gym. I just want to sit and enjoy time with my family. I want to ""vedge out"" so there is a break in the monotony so I don't go crazy. I want to be there to put my daughter to bed at night. And I want to spend some 1 on 1 time with my wife. I'm assuming those things make it easier for me to turn the switch off. 

I need someone who can relate to me. someone who has been in my shoes and still lost weight. I'm not a loser. I try to be active. I play softball every Sunday and I try not to sit around but I seem to have ZERO will power when it comes to eating. I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like such a failure. Every day that I look in the mirror the thought of surgery seems so easy. I want to take the easy way out but my mother in law had surgery and she died. not directly from the surgery, she started drinking heavily. the drinking caused her pain so she started taking tons of pain meds and one day she took the wrong pain med with alcohol and her heart stopped. I don't want that for me and my life. I want the satisfaction of knowing that I did it myself and that I did it with hard work and diet and exercise but mentally I just can't do it. 

I don't know why I'm writing all this. I don't know what I want or how I expect reddit to help, exercise, praising, friendship, mentoring, etc. maybe I can do it. Am I asking too much? 

Thank you for reading. 

EDIT: When I say 1 on 1 time I just mean time with my wife. talking and such. not NECESSARILY sex ;)

My journey started many years ago, only 5 foot 9 but I always had a wee bit of a belly. I got the usual bit of bullying here and there, nothing too major.

The worst thing I ever did was leave school a year earlier than all my friends and get an apprenticeship, and then dropped out of college and I kept playing games. I would only venture outside to pick up benefits (social security I guess to Americans) and get Chinese Food, Pizza or other fast food. 

I eventually got a job and I've been employed ever since
/
I tried kettlebells. Slim Fast. Hiring a personal trainer. Scottish Slimmers. Weight Watchers. Calorie counting. I read Steve Jobs biography and tried eating nothing but carrots and apples for a week.

Back in May a friend told me about her experience with Slimming World. I admit

And I went to group and met my amazing consultant, I felt like I actually fit in. I got the plan, studied it intensely, and applied it starting on Wednesday morning. I went in to group that week with a loss of 12.5 lbs my first week. From that point on I was hooked, it's been 28 weeks since, I've maintained, gained
I'm not at 19 stones and 9 lbs and I haven't been this weight since I was 18 years old. And I tell you what

I was lost and alone yearning for a life I was not living. Last month, life is good and I am on the path to something awesome.

Losing the weight was not an easy task.  I started by walking ten minutes a day and reducing my calorie and carb intake. Eventually

Some background info: I'm a 6'5"" 28 year old male. I have always been on the heavy side. Yet growing up I was always active in sports. Soccer (later football) in the Fall, and swimming in the Summer. That came to an abrupt end when I graduated HS.  I was used to eating high cal meals for so long to support my active lifestyle, that when my activity levels changed I didn't know how to change my diet.

Fast forward to my 21st birthday and now alcohol is an easy access item that I find I can’t live without. Long story short

I became a real grumpy asshole. I never had energy to do anything. I was either intoxicated or hungover. I didn’t have the confidence to go chasing girls. I hated myself. 

January 2013 rolls around and now I have the flu. I was sicker than I had ever been before, I decided it was time I change my life and get back in shape. 

Diet: firstly I eliminated all soda except for the occasional diet something.  Desserts, so that wasn’t an issue. Coffee though was a bit different. I was used to sugar and cream in it every morning. It took a little time, but now I enjoy my coffee sugarless and black. Caffeine!!

I used to eat pizza 2 or 3 times a week for lunch; or more. I’ve pretty much eliminated all meals that are carb focused. Protein and veggies are the name of the game now. Salads with steak or chicken have become my go to lunch. Dinner usually is a meat

Two meals a day. I’ve never had the stomach to eat anything in the morning. A previous night’s drinking session or not. 

I think the biggest change has come from my elimination of alcohol during the week. I can’t yet break from the habit of drinking on the weekends

I started lifting weights again too. I really missed the feeling!!! Right now I can only focus on upper body since my knees still get too sore for lower exercises. Overall I’m feeling better than I can remember. 

 So back to that scale. As of this morning

FAQ:

How old am I?

-22

How tall am I?

-5'10''

What did I do to lose all that weight?

-I worked hard. That's really all there is to it. You want something? You gotta work hard to get it. But most importantly, where I would cheat on my diet or even skip the gym because i didn't feel like doing it anymore. But what made the difference is that I picked myself up shortly afterwards and kept on going.

Did I plateau?

-Yes. Many times. And let me tell you, and 185. It took me over a month to get over those, but once I did, my body just started shedding like 2+ pounds a week.

Do I lift weights?

-Yes. I work all muscle groups doing random weight training exercises everyday.

What cardio machines did I use?

-90% elliptical. 5% treadmill. 5% bicycle.

How often did I go to the gym?

-Everyday. I personally don't believe in rest days.

Did I follow a certain exercise program or diet program?

-No. I kinda just did what felt right. At the gym I did what really got my heart beat going and made me workout the most. As for a diet, etc. There's no need to follow a strict diet and eat the same stuff every time. Just eat healthy.

What's the best advise that I can give to someone who is trying to lose a lot of weight?

-Do not give up. No matter what. You miss one day at the gym? Or eat unhealthy one day? pick yourself right back up the next day and punish yourself at the gym. Also, 1 year of hard work = a lifetime of benefits.

When did I start seeing results?

-Within 2 months. They were small,False,,t5_2rz8w,True,,140lbs,t3_t6rkp

I started out at 280. It was the heaviest that I've ever been in my entire life. I got out of a really bad relationship and ate my feelings for a year

Diets never worked for me. There was always too much pressure. I would lose 20 pounds

I really changed my daily eating habits. I eat pretty much nothing but fresh fruit and veg, but I haven't had red meat or pork in months. I stopped drinking soda altogether, even though I made the switch to strictly diet a long time ago, I knew that I needed to drink more water. I really miss cheesesteaks and ice cream and chinese food, and honestly sometimes I indulge in those things. But they have become an indulgence, instead of daily fare. And I'm pretty sure that is what has made the most difference. Now that I'm not so painfully heavy, I am able to walk up stairs without having to pause to catch my breath. I am able to actually exercise! I started walking. I probably don't exercise as much as I should, but I'm certainly much more consistent with it than I have been in the past.

This was me at 280
*note: please ignore the ridiculous look on my face. This is probably the only full body picture I've allowed to be taken of me in 5 years...

Until today. This is me now. 230 pounds

I'm not done. I still want to lose another 30 to 40 pounds. But for the first time in years, I don't need to count calories or points, I don't need to deprive myself of the things that I loved. I just recognized that my love affair with food is toxic, and it was killing me, body and soul.

This is an update to my progress, like every one here has help motivate me.

 Its hard to think, to get motivated again, after they had lost a lot of weight. I thought to my self, they look so good, they have lost all that weight. What on earth, could bring down their motivation.

 I finally realize that lack of motivation, I would give my self one a week, then it turned into 3, then 5.. I have slowly reverted, in a matter of 3 weeks, back to how I was eating before I started my weight loss journey.

I was strict, tuna, and lots of almonds. Salad and vegies of course. Hardly ever ate any carbs, other than wild rice.
Drank nothing but water.

I am going at least 4 times a week, then cooled down with a half mile walk 3.5mph at 10 incline. I then went and worked my arms, and abs for 20 mins, then did a 20 min run on the exercise bike set at 7 resistance. Finished up my cardio on an elliptical for 20 mins.

How I did it:

I used multiple methods. At first

Then I transitioned to strict calorie counting with My Fitness Pal. This was good for the next 120 pounds. 

The last 30 pounds has been fairly difficult-- mainly because I've been taking off fat and putting on muscle

I just want you all to remember: you're so much more than a number on a scale. You're more than your waistline or the size shirt you wear. You are capable of *so much*-- more than you'd *ever* believe. And it all starts with a single step.",,t5_2rz8w,False,,200lbs,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jbhun/finally_got_to_change_my_flair_from_150_to_200/

So where do I even start? Well... I suppose the start

One of my first memories as a child was me in our tiny little bathroom looking in the mirror, and pulling it against me so it looked like I was thin. I remember my sister walking in and giving me a strange look. I told her that I wished I didn't have all ""this skin"" on my stomach, and that I would look so much better without it. I don't remember her reply, but the thing that sticks out in my memory is the fact that as a child the thing I was looking at when I looked in the mirror was my fat and how I wished it wasn't there. I even used to wear those stretchy, nude, bandage things that people wrap around a sprained ankle around my stomach so it looked like I was more thin. Shapewear for a seven year old. 

Being the chubby kid in school was really hard for me. I grew up with my single mother and older sister in a trailer park where money was very scarce. Well that combined with being overweight caused a lot of teasing. I remember one year of school my mother had bought me a new shirt, and is still not all there today. 

In third grade we moved in with my mothers boyfriend and he was super strict with food. There was no soda, and all the snacks in the house were locked up in a cupboard away from us kids. We always ate lots of veggies, or else we went hungry. I very quickly lost all the weight and was even considered a normal size even though I thought I was still fat.

Eventually their relationship ended and we moved in with another guy. All my sugary vices were at my disposal again. I ate lots of junk food, and my friend lived an hour walk away, so everyday I got at least two hours of walking in. It wasn't until high school came around that things changed. 

I decided to go to a different high school than everyone I knew that was on the other side of town, so I didn't do any sort of exercise to keep the pounds off.

I gained some weight, and my sister had moved out, so I left very abandoned. I was skipping to get someone's attention. Well, I only saw her for two days once a month, so she really didn't know, or pay attention. 

I started channeling my emotions into food. I would eat and eat and eat because I felt lonely. My mother's boyfriend would pick me up breakfast from Tim Hortons

Things ended up getting worse when that man abused me. After that my weight sky rocketed. I didn't even notice either. I didn't really care much anyways. I became depressed, and didn't want to go anywhere. 

So skip forward to 2012. Starting around July I had really noticed the fact I had gained some serious weight. I wanted to change, so I never really acted on it. Eventually in August we broke up.

I spent a lot of time moping around. Because I was alone I felt really unattractive

I started off small at first. I cut out soda cold turkey

I wish I could provide a before weight.... but we didn't have a scale at the time, even though I had already lost a good bit. 

Right now I'm 132, but either way I'm very proud of myself. I never thought I'd be able to do this. To lose the weight from 175 I cut out almost all red meat except for a treat every now and again. I eat small meals through out the day. I take multi-vitamins. I eat lots of salads, and yogurt. I keep my calories to 1200 a day, and I find it's more than enough to satisfy me. Exercise wise I don't really do much. I walk my dogs for about an hour each day if that counts. I also sometimes squeeze my butt muscles while I'm watching TV, but I don't really think that does anything, it just makes me feel more productive... 

Overall I feel like a brand new person

I decided to start working out that summer and dropped about 25lbs. Cue my third year of university, to whom I was incredibly close, as well as a good childhood friend. I totally let myself go; I put on 42 lbs in 6-8 months and essentially didn't emerge from my room. 

7 months ago at the end of March 2012, I decided to actually try and make a lifestyle change, deciding enough was really enough.

I started a hard program involving 3 days of high intensity interval training/body weight circuit training and 2 days of DC strength each week, and I'm feeling great (http://imgur.com/w5n71).

In October 2011 I started counting calories. I only ate around 1500kcal per day. I also started doing some sport. For the first few weeks I rode my stationary bike for 30 minutes

In November 2012 a friend of mine invited me to his gym. I liked it because it was something different. Riding a bike gets boring after a time and I also wanted to gain some muscles. Well and this is how I lost very fast weight - by weightlifting. At the beginning I didn't really know what to do so I just trained every part of my body and went every day to the gym. I gained some muscles and felt that I became stronger. Then I started to organize myself. I started a split-programe and now I go 3 times a week to the gym for weightlifting. One day I just run for 45 minutes on the treadmill. It's really amazing how my body changed. At the beginning I couldn't run for 10 minutes

Anyways
Also I want to know: Am I ugly? I know this isn't the right subreddit but yeah.

At the end of 2011, and Nearly Dead to get pumped about juicing and dove right in. The weight has been falling off ever since, though not without what feels like a herculean amount of effort.

I meticulously count my calories. I lift heavy weights 4-5x a week, and do as much yoga as possible (usually 3x a week). I'm blessed to work a job that gives me a paid hour daily to work out, so that gives me the chance to go 1.5-2 hours a day without cutting into personal time too much.

Maintenance is easy for me

I fell in love with fitness while on this journey. I thought for awhile that I wanted to be a personal trainer

My original goal was 175 lbs. Now I'm there and it's still easy enough to lose that I think I may have a 165 or even a 160 in me. We'll see. Anyway

I went low-carb and used myfitnesspal to track my calories and exercise (which consisted of biking to work.) But then a month later, vegetable oils, legumes, and sugars. I started eating meat, eggs, full fat dairy, and even more vegetables than I was eating before. I stopped tracking my calories and started focusing on high quality real food.

I cook my of my meals at home and try to stay paleo when I eat out but I do indulge in cheat/treats without feeling guilt. Paleo is not a religion for me so there is no sin in having an occasional chocolate chip cookie or more-than-occasional ice cream.

1328555650.0,pdiad,Diets don't work. Lifestyle changes do. ,Parker2010,563,134,134,"Some tips for people who have a lot of weight to lose and have a hard time dieting

I started at 550+ and am now down to 470.  These are the things I’ve been doing to create a change in my lifestyle that would promote a healthy weight so it’s not a ‘diet’. I’m just changing my habits. 

The number one tip I can give is to make small
My first step was to give up fast food.  I started by picking 2 restaurants I’d no longer frequent.  So I tried to keep myself from eating fast food in general, and so on.  Now I don’t crave any fast food whatsoever.  It just doesn’t really occur to me to eat it any more.  

Next I wanted to tackle my snacking.  I ate out of boredom, I phased out other snacks.   At the same time I was trying to get myself to eat fruits and raw vegetables more frequently.  So I’d make myself eat at least ONE piece of fruit or serving of raw veggies a day, whatever and however I wanted.  Those healthy snacks started to replace the bad ones, and the frequency of my snacks diminished as well. 

Next was Diet cola.  I drank 2 liters of diet soda daily, and then ice water with lemon.   Now I’m down to only a glass or two a week.  
Basically it comes down to this.  You start small, and I’m much healthier.  At no point was it difficult because I wasn’t doing anything drastic.  

Now I’m working on exercise.  I found a personal trainer I meet with once a week. He’s helping me to build up lean muscle and increase my range of motion, but I’m going to start with making sure that I go at least ONE day a week and working my way up from there.

You don’t have to throw your entire way of being upside down to lose weight.  You can make small changes

After topping out at around 250lb last year I knew something needed to change. I was nearly 18 stone

I've always been a big guy at 6'4. And I played rugby in my final year of my under-graduate degree and built myself up to a decent level of fitness. Then piled all the weight back on during my post-grad course.

One day I made the decision to download an iOS app called Interval Run

After a few months of running the dark nights came in and I decided to join the gym to carry on. The only problem with my gym is that it's a small community gym with hardly any equipment (two treadmills + the rest) and when it gets busy there's a 15 minute limit. So I started to do some weights.

I got in touch with an old friend of mine who had gone into personal training and he said he would develop a workout program for me. After 4 months I was starting to really notice the weight come off.

Through a combination of upper and lower body days with some cardio included the weight fell off

The initial plan involved 'alkalising' my body

After an initial 9 days of ultra-low carbs to reprogram myself I'm now on a program of backloading on training days and eating low carbs when I'm not training. It can be tough on some days but I'm so pleased I've made the change and have adjusted to this - the comments and support from friends and family make it all totally worth it.

So I'm now down to 205lb (204.8 to be precise)

Why is 42lb a milestone? If you're from the UK you may know it's 3 stone. So I've gone from 17 stone 8 to 14 stone 8.

[Here's an album of my progress.](http://imgur.com/a/wiwSp)

Edit: I've gone from an XL to a L (M in some cases)

I [F/27] reached my highest scale number ever last year at 140 lbs at 5'1. I was active for pretty much my entire life. I did swimming from the time I was 9 to about 15. Between 16 and 22

After I graduated from college
Last year

**THE PLAN**

** Start date: April 2012**
This is how I looked like at the beginning (February
http://imgur.com/KQSrIBj
http://imgur.com/KcGjHic

My first target was to reduce portion size. I was eating more than most of my male co-workers at lunch time (and I hadn't noticed until they told me lol). I'm a very petite girl

Step 1 was to download the LoseIt! app and trying to stick to 1200 cals daily. [Side note: I kept at it for about 6 months

As far as exercise

This is what I looked like at -8 lbs (August

http://imgur.com/K8QPUmk

**Time to get Serious: September
Around this time, and to work out more. 

I talked to my trainer, I needed the extra sleep LOL. 

At some point in time

**What happened after I reached my goal?**

Since January

This is my new party trick:
http://imgur.com/GV0uKYZ

I also joined a running club. I run 5km once or twice a week at nights. I thought I wasn't going to be able to keep up with them

This is what I look like right now at 117 lbs [April
http://imgur.com/FXao8Dt

The current workout routine is basically kickboxing 3-4 times a week (he is bumping it up and teaching me some brazilian jijuitsu now)
I eat pretty much whatever I want but obviously, plenty of protein and veggies/fruits). I also snack between meals (mostly raw almonds, fruit or granola bars). I ditched sodas unless I have a special occassion. I do have desserts about once a week. 
I honestly don't feel limited about the way I eat :)

**Future Goals**

I don't have a scale number in mind that I want to reach anymore. I want to avoid going over 120 lbs
The way I'm going exercise/diet wise

My goals are more fitness related. For example, learning even more MMA. Being stronger, more focused. 

**Closing Comments/Advice**

1) If you want to lose weight, make a meal plan for the week, etc. 

2) Exercise-wise, try 3 for the first month or 2. As time goes by, bump it up. And once you feel you can go at it, train HARD. Make that 1 hr of your day you are working out worth it. Feel your heart pumping, sweat it. You know what I'm talking about. 

3) Food is KEY. If you work out like a crazy person but eat badly, eat smaller meals, fill up with low cal foods (eat a salad with every meal for example). Count calories if you feel you need to learn about portion size. 

4) Don't let plateaus scare you. They happen to everyone. Switch it up

5) Don't be prey to the routine. If you eat the same things every day

6) No gym? No problem. The internet and exercise vids are your friends. There's Insanity, this is NOT a walk in the park). 
Also

7) Make exercise a part of your daily schedule. Pick a non-negotiable time of the day to do it. If you can only work out at night

8) Every single bit of exercise counts. You don't have 1 full hour at lunch time? It's fine

9) Celebrate your NSV's!!!! Managed to run 20 min on the treadmill without fainting??? Be happy about that. Be happy about being able to do anything you couldn't do before. Be grateful to your body. 

10) Beware of alcohol empty cals. Seriously, dance. You'll burn some of that alcohol off that way. 

11) Get a support group and ignore the haters. The LoseIt community has helped me inmensely. Seeing your pix and knowing there's people out there with the same struggles, or exercising too much even if what you are doing is perfectly healthy. Don't get sucked in. Don't go under any of the recommended guidelines for daily caloric intake though!!!!

12) Love and work what you have. I have hated my pear shape for as long as I remember. The fitter I've gotten, you will never know you are awesome at something until you try it. Always wanted to try rowing? Give it a shot... you might surprise yourself ;)

That's it

**TL/DR:** Made it to my -20lbs goal with diet and exercise. If you want to know the story

**Edit:** Thank you SO much for all your compliments! :) It has meant a lot to me and definitely encourages me to continue my journey. Good luck to all of those wanting to start your own journey or in the middle of it. I'm here if you ever need anything ;)

I know you can find it in the weekly threads now, it's full of great NSVs that aren't seen. They either are sitting at 1 upvote or 2, and have no comments.


To me


I feel like I've seen hardly any progress pictures recently. It seems like a few months ago these would be everywhere. Again
Another thing that slightly bothers me is the lack of links. Maybe this is why I perceive there being less progress pictures, in this subreddit of all places. There was a great post a few months ago that someone posted here along the lines of, ""If anyone deserves the right to post a link for karma, it's people posting progress pics for all the hard work you've done.""


Regardless, it will get a few comments, a few upvotes, and be left alone. But even those few comments can change someone's thought about their success and give them the strength to keep going, as opposed to not receiving comments in the weekly thread and thinking, ""Well, I guess it wasn't a big deal.""

What do I do? Calorie Count, it goes in my calorie counter.  I started with 1800 calories (I think), then dropped it down to 1500.  Then around last spring I dropped it to 1200, and last summer/fall I dropped my limit to 1000.  It's been there since.

I'm an active reader of this sub and have been the whole way, that didn't mean the progress I made didn't happen.

Better shot of my face from two weeks ago: http://imgur.com/fbfE81c

Pic on the left is from my friend's graduation in May of 2012. I remember wearing that dress, since I avoided having my photo taken at all costs. I was so ashamed of my body. Depressed because I weighed so much, ate because I was depressed. Caught in the vicious cycle.

But here I am

I really didn't start exercising, and then 30 minutes of toning at home. I love Denise Austin's body sculpting videos from the 80's because they are low impact, and I work 11-14 hours, 5 days a week, so I don't want to be exhausted before I even begin my shift. There are some days that I don't get to the gym, and that's okay! I don't want to over do it!

I think that diet and exercise were both extremely important factors on my road to where I am now... But being able to find happiness and self purpose in life has allowed me to come this far. It is very difficult to be depressed, but not have any drive to get there. It brought me down farther each time I would fail, and I would always find comfort in food. 

I am not where I want to be

To give some back story, compassionless blob.  At 6'2 363 pounds, I was fairly gargantuan in stature.  However, I was as tepid as a field mouse inside.  I hated every bit of myself.  I hated that I was so big and ate so much, I hated that I was too shy to talk to anyone, I hated that I spent 95% of my time away from work at my computer desk, playing online games where I could make friends because I felt safe that nobody could see me.  My turning point was a combination of 2 events: Christmas 2010, I turned my head to one of my distant relatives whom I rarely ever see or speak to..  And I see her point at me, my cheeks pushed up and covered up most of my eyes.  But.. I pushed it aside and moved on.  A few days later, then I decided to make the switch to a paleo-esque diet and started working out and have done this lifestyle for about a year.  I'm not the most dedicated gymgoer

I've gone from a 4XL shirt to an XL, and had never even kissed anyone before.  I've met many new friends and faces, and am not afraid to be myself anymore.  In fact, I love myself most of the time.  I know that I am a great person, inside and out.  Of course, I have moments where some of those old negative thoughts come back.. losing weight is as much of a mental struggle as it is a physical one and as time goes on, I know I will overcome the mental blocks that show up.  As I said in another thread

My weight loss journey started 2 years ago - I was 330 pounds, and it isn't anywhere NEAR 330). Through better food choices and becoming more active, I have slowly lost over 100 pounds now. I still have about 40 pounds to where I'd love to start my maintenance, but reading through threads today I realized that there are many things that I've already been able to enjoy even though I haven't made it through the finish line.

* I can now fit in airplane seats.
* I spend less money on food overall (more on groceries slightly
* I was able to hike over 1000 miles on the Appalachian Trail this summer - I'd never even camped overnight before, and was much stronger by the end of my hike!
* Less people assume I am stupid and/or lazy. What a terrible and usually untrue stereotype for very obese people. 
* People meet my eyes when they talk to me. I still struggle with doing the same.
* I can fit into (the high end of) off-rack normal-sized clothing for the first time since I was in high school (I'm 32). 
* I can workout like a boss and enjoy the endorphins I get from it.
* I have finished two 5k races and look forward to the weather warming up so I can do some more
* People just treat me differently now. I never realized how biased people can be when you're very overweight until I had something to compare it to.
* I have actually had guys offer to buy me drinks. That's a first.
* I can fit on amusement park rides!
* People don't look mad if I try to sit next to them on airplanes or transportation.
* Friends don't automatically assume I have to sit in the front seat of a car anymore when we carpool to places.
* I can wear shirt that show off my back tattoo without worrying about my back fat.
* I CAN CROSS MY LEGS COMFORTABLY WHILE SITTING!!!! LIKE A LADY!

Looking back (there are more, and it's motivation to see this journey through to the end.

I can't wait until I'm able to post my before/after pics - they're already pretty great, and please share the changes YOU'VE seen! I'd love to read them for even more motivation... and if you're just starting out or have a long way to go, that's ok - I'd love to hear what changes you're looking forward to as well!

Currently I weigh in at 172 lbs. and still have a bit more work to do [May 2011](http://i.imgur.com/Fqr4z.jpg), now fiancée, who needs to do her own post :P

In my first year of weight loss is when I got the most weight off (100lbs.) and I have a seen a steady decline from then as I stopped burning everything off and started adding more lean muscle. My routine/diet are fairly simple:
6:00 am - Get to the gym (more on routine in a bit)
8:00 am - Home
10:00 am - Snack consisting of some fruit
12:00 pm - Sandwich or wrap with lots of veggies
2:00 pm - Snack on some more fruit
5:00 pm - High protein
8:00 pm - 25g of casein

At the gym I have two types of days, upperbody 2, and legs, and I do about 30 minuets of cardio (all on the elliptical). Upperbody 1 consists of back and shoulder exercises and upper body 2 is arms and chest.

I made a New Year's resolution which lasted two weeks before I fell back into bad eating habits. Fast forward to April 1, I had been tracking my weight each week since October 2012. I weighed 380, and as I wrote down my weight, I looked at the other entries, and realized how far I could have come if I would have just lost 1-2 lbs a week, not to mention how fast all that time had flown by. 

I then decided to try again, but that's not what I came here to say. This isn't about how much weight I lost, or how I did it. This is about taking the first step by not worrying about how far it is to the finish line. 

When I had wanted to start, surely I would fail again, but when I completed those two months I didn't want to stop. The number on the scale is a powerful thing, and once you see it begin to fall, you'll only wish you had started sooner.

One of the most worrisome things about losing an extreme amount of weight is the excess skin. I lost 190lbs and was left with bad skin infections so removal was necessary. I know a lot of people on this subreddit are losing life-changing amounts that will result in saggy skin issues so hopefully this will give some insight to those that were morbidly obese like me at one point.

( That's 108 kilos to 72ish kilos

Whee! I posted before, and I really don't recognize myself anymore. It's so peculiar, but I love having my photo taken now! 

How did I achieve this turnaround? No freaking clue. What's that joke about how to eat an elephant? I floundered around with weightloss plans, low carb, strict keto. Working out. Not working out. Trying to kill the depression eating. Once I got that under control (and the depression), I started ratting out food sensitivities. I learned to listen to my body. Once that happened the weight just flew off. Also, on a few occasions, my pants. Luckily my neighbors didn't notice the pantsless girl up on a ladder trying not to spill paint as she frantically hobbled down. 

I'm not a fan of vegetables (the texture! ugh..) so I've been digging a lot of vegtable soups as a way to force myself into 2-3 servings of vegetables a day. Today I decided with certainty that if I eat any more butternut squash soup I'm. just. going. to. lose. my. mind. Broccoli soup is cool though.

Four years ago I delivered twins who were each about 8lbs.  (That's big for twins. real big.) One year ago I delivered our third baby- a 9 pounder. I thoroughly enjoyed my pregnancies and it showed ;) 

About 6 weeks after the baby was born, and limiting my calories (after my 3 months of WW expired I just switched to MyFitnessPal), the weight has been steadily coming off. I feel awesome. It's a struggle to find time to workout and often even harder to make healthy food choices. (I work in my family's pizzeria...enough said.) I just try to visualize my inner MILF to keep motivated ;)

I was at my worst at 200, and usually turned to food for comfort. It also doesn't help that I'm short. I was constantly making excuses, spent a lot of time whining about my problems to the Internet (where, sadly, people seemed to be more tolerable of me than they are in person due to what I believed was my appearance). My appearance and weight made me so bitter, and fearful of approaching people and making friends. I was socially awkward and I always felt like my body was in the way of people, blocking their path or being an eye sore. At school, from my understanding

I was always stationary. I didn't exercise and was usually too depressed to. My ex at the time treated me like I was a ghost when we lived together for a year. I was miserable, I tried to find ways to be happier.

I started exercising, and it didn't help that my ex was secretly talking to women online while I was alone in bed crying. I wanted to be better, but I didn't do it because of my ex. I wanted a better life for myself and to be treated with fairness and respect, and the first thing I had to do was respect and take care of myself. I was self-deprecating at the time, but now I'm growing more and more in love with myself and the person I'm becoming.

I visited the gym almost 5-6 days a week, no sweets/starches/anything made with flour/anything really salty. I ate lots of veggies and fruits, particularly apples, cucumbers, broccoli, and spinach. 

I visited the gym way too much. My coworkers noticed and expressed concern. I really wanted to work hard, and I would always try my best to avoid the mess of a relationship that waits for me there.  I did various activities and exercises and read closely to whatever posts or information I could scour on /loseit and /fitness. I did this for about two months until my visits were less regular--probably about three times a week now. Why?

I lost weight. People seemed to check me out more. I became more and more confident and social. Eventually

I think my highest weight was around 340lbs (possibly more... none of the scales I got on before going to the gym went higher than 300), but I didn't know that at the time. 

I decided that I was done with being overweight. I constantly had back problems, and sitting in any defined chair space (like at the movies, in an airplane, at school) was impossible and embarrassing. As a kid I was pudgy, as a teenager I became obese, and once I was out on my own and able to buy my own food, things got out of hand. 

Livestrong's MyPlate quickly became my best friend. I found a personal trainer who kicked my ass 2 or 3 times a week for almost 4 years

When my mom passed away, it was back to the routine. Ups and downs, plateaus... it's been tough, I'll say that much. 

I just made a pretty big jump from 1600 kcal/day down to about 1250 kcal/day, whenever I go to the gym, I get incredibly hungry even though I drink a protein shake right after. But we just gotta keep on keepin', right?

I am no scientist, and if you are struggling

The more sugar we eat, being severely obese, and being Native American (high risk), I knew I had to get off the habit. This was about five years ago. So I tested something out. 

I decided to go for **7 days without any sugar.** No honey in my tea, nothing that had added sugar in it, NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER, and not too much fruit. It was pretty difficult. I would get antsy and come as close as having a cookie on my lips, before I would throw it away and walk out of the house in desperation to stick to my goal. I lived in a house that always had unhealthy food around - making it even more difficult. I kept a small bag of raisins around, of which I would allow myself 3-4 once or twice a day to calm my cravings. Then by about the 4th or 5th day, the cravings had subsided. By the 7th day, and went 10 days without any sugar. And it worked! My cravings were so dull

After that, instead of pretending to agree with them to not sound like a fatty. I admit, my sweet tooth has reared it's ugly head a few times in the last 5 years. Like around my birthday, or the holidays, when I let myself go or I am surrounded by sweets. Then, I'll just do the process again: 7 days without sugars. And voila!

Walking was good, then walk until I could catch my breath. The weight melted off. I hit a plateau for a couple of months, but then I changed it up.

My highest weight was 210 lbs -- and thanks to an adolescence spent comfort eating and indulging in self-pity

My doctor and parents tried their best to get me to stop gaining weight

My turning point came when I was 17. I fell down the basement stairs

For my entire life

My weight loss was slow and steady -- it's taken me almost five years to reach my goal of loosing 90 lbs. My routine has stayed pretty constant:

1. Walking 30 minutes, you need to have the correct footwear, training schedule and technique in order to avoid injury and I was way too clueless to attempt that at the time. So walking seemed like simple, inexpensive and low-stress cardio. It also gave me time to clear my head.

2. Drink water. I never payed attention to the quantity of water I drank

3. Eat what you want -- but stop eating when you're full. This was the BIGGEST problem for me; my family loves to eat simply for the sake of eating and I definitely inherited that tendency. But I try to remind myself that nothing is off limits as long as I just have a small amount -- once you get to that point of diminishing returns, if I wouldn't feed it to my future child, I probably have no business eating it myself.

And the last piece of advice -- just take it one day at a time. Yes, what I want and exactly what I am capable of achieving.

EDIT: This is the ""amazing sister"". I was told that I needed to get on here and properly share my story. I always had a weight problem. I love using past tense. I had progressively gotten more and more overweight as I grew up. Granted I have a ways to go, because I didn't have the energy or strength to do what they were doing. I lied to myself that it wasn't ""that bad"".  I got more stretching done just by trying to tie my shoes. I got winded walking up the 15 steps to leave my house each morning. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I ate to celebrate good things. I ate to comfort myself during the bad times. I wasn't feeding myself, I was feeding my emotions. I spent 8 hours sitting at a desk at work and then came home and sat in front of the TV/computer for another 6 hours before I would go to bed.

I was never able to get control on my weight and it just got progressively out of control the older I got. More weight meant less activities. More weight meant bigger clothes. Bigger clothes meant shopping in the old ladies section. Old ladies section meant Erin was not looking good. Seriously.

I made peace with myself. I made peace that I would never be healthy

Then 2005 rolled around. I was at the highest weight I had every been, went in for a consultation, and because I was un-insured i.e. no red tape, the surgery was done 2 weeks later. It was the best/worst 6 months of my life. I lost 50lbs like that. I had more energy. I was losing weight, despite what I ate. I started going to the gym. But I hadn't made any mental/emotional progress. I found out soon enough that Ben &amp; Jerry's goes through that smaller stomach super nice. And if I wanted to eat more, all it took was another glass of water. Soon enough I had gained back the 50 lbs and an additional 25, just for kicks.

A year ago I had had enough. Something finally clicked. I had to do something, the largest I had ever every been. I told myself there was no way I would get to 400. 

I called one of the local gyms and talked to one of the membership people. I told her my story, challenge me, but not kill me. I made an appointment to meet with them 20 minutes later. I walked in, got a tour of the facility, set up my membership and signed up with a personal trainer. 

For the first 9 months I worked out with a trainer twice a week. The other days I would rotate between cardio and strength training. Six days a week (sometimes 7) I would be at the gym for at least 90 minutes. I had to. It made me feel better. It made me happier and gave me more energy. It still does. 

I went in to see my doctor in May. Complete clean bill of health. She took me off my anti depressant medication and was so thrilled for me. I ran my first 5K in May. I volunteered for Spartan Race in June (so I can see what I'm getting myself into when I sign up to run it next year). I was on the injured list for 2 months while dealing with some tendonitis. It stopped me from running

I now meet with my trainer once every other week (they get expensive

I'm still working on my eating habits. I definitely notice the difference my body feels when I'm eating healthier. It kind of goes in shock whenever I over do it on the sugar. If I could still get my sweet tooth under control things would be a lot better! When I'm really doing what I need to do, 35% protein, and 15% fat. I started at 60%/25%/15% respectively and have adjusted as I have lost weight and gained more control over my eating. It's definitely not perfect, but it's better than the fast food, ice cream, pizza phase I was in for so long.

My battle with weight
 

At the age of 15 I weighed in at 200lbs, took his advice and signed us up for a gym in Cleveland, Ohio. My trainer was John Black a known powerlifter who broke records in the 80's, and his gym catered to police officers and fireman looking to bulk up, I was often the only female but the other patrons looked after me as a daughter and the atmosphere was supportive. At 17 I started to eat normally again, I was tired of barely eating because of the restrictions of the Atkins Diet. From the age of 17 to 21 my eating worsened, I stopped working out consistently, weighing in at 220lbs. In 2009 I graduated from graduate school and started full-time work, I choose not to eat certain foods
 

Now what?
 

In November 2011 I started a blog (nowwhatjessica.wordpress.com) to document my weight loss after people started writing me on Facebook for tips on how to lose weight. I want to continue to work out and eventually tone up my problem areas (arms and stomach).  I also plan to become a Certified Personal Trainer to help others with their fitness goals!

I decided last night that it was time to stack up the old against the new and get a good visual for myself, 250 is a healthy weight for me. But now that I've hit that, I can see there are still some areas and improvements that can be made, so will be targeting some specifics going forward.

As far as how I've been losing weight, which tracks your activity level throughout the day.  Compared to the high octane crap and complete lack of activity from before, this method has been successful and not terribly difficult to maintain.  Eating right and maintaining a reasonable activity level has made me feel like a new person.

One day in summer of 2011, vital signs, etc. I knew I was overweight and unhappy with myself but stepping on the scale worsens those feelings. Well, the nurse called out my weight at the time- ""270 lbs. Is that a loss or a gain?"" I said ""that's very much a gain."" One would think that would be a wake-up call but months later, after Christmas, I decided what I was gonna do with the new year.

Come January 2012, I weigh in at 171 lbs. making me nearly 100 lbs. lighter and have never felt better. These results cost me next to nothing, just an investment in a decent pair of running shoes! There was no fad fitness or diets. I relied on random exercise videos such as those by Denise Austin, walked at distances I found to be challenging before eventually moving up to running. As for my diet, I started consuming more water and eating lighter. For now, I have upped on protein and whole grain foods. Soon, I will attempt to start fitness training to get toned and lean.

I've been on a diet for a month and a half now and I've lost 10 kilograms (20 lbs), and that's the plan - I'm signing up for it soon; but frankly, I'm a little terrified.

I've always had people look down on me, but the remarks surely are not. I wanted to start swimming two years ago, but I've had a group of teenagers point at me and laugh; I never went back again (I wish I hadn't given up so easily). Now, I'm scared how people will react to me and my very overweight body at the gym.

I already went to my local gym to ask around and the receptionist said that they ""do have overweight clients, but it's a small gym so chances are I would be the biggest one out there. I'm scared of how people will look at me, what they will think and so on. 

For all of you that do work out, anything like that? I don't need encouragement, as I will go anyway, but I want to be prepared for what I'm about to face. Also, what kind of exercise did you start with to build up your stamina? My stamina at the moment really, *really* sucks so I'm scared of making a total fool of myself by completely failing at exercising...

It started at the local pub some drunk angry guy punched me in the face and I was receiving threats from him because he got banned from the pub

I also went down to the local chemist and signed up for tony ferguson weight loss shakes

I proceeded with the shakes for a few more weeks and added more protein as I was going to the gym a lot doing 45 minutes cardio a day

After a few weeks I went down to 1 shake a day and added in wholegrain bread for fiber.
At the moment I'm on about 200g of protein a day and lots veggies and various things I see at the supermarket that give me fiber.

I feel like the most important part of my diet was portion control. After I stopped the shakes ( I still have one now and then when there is nothing else in the house) I didn't really stick to a strict diet I just made sure I ate plenty of veggies and whenever I would eat something ask myself ""Will this be beneficial to my weight loss plan."" If the answer was yes I would eat it

Few days ago I have started doing push ups I can only do about 10 a night right now but I'm working to 100. I'm also going to take some form of martial art class soon just trying to find one I like.

**My Routine:**

No food is off the table, candy bars, cookies, peanut butter (but I do use PB2!), nutella, brownies, pastries, etc. I still have them


I eat 1800 calories a day most days (not net), and have just started weight training in the past month and a half. 
WEIGHT TRAINING IS AWESOME. OMG, don't be afraid to pump some iron! Plus, it's helping with any loose skin issues.


**TIPS:**

*  Count calories

*  Make small changes. I eat tons and tons of veggies

*  Enjoy life, consider taking classes like Zumba or spinning. At the same time, remember that one night of wine and sushi and candy (as pictured above) will not ruin you! I still have a cheat day once per month, and maintenance days every week or so.

*  Be your own chef. I eat 90% homemade meals I cook, and coconut milk and look up some recipes online. Eating healthy doesn't mean eating bland foods, by any means. Food is nourishing--it can be tasty, too! (r/fitmeals is a great resource)

*  Protein is very filling.

*  Whole grains over white. 

*  Veggies in ALL the things!  Also

*  Find replacements that work for you. PB2 is very tasty, and are actually filling (egg whites and whole grains!). I also use Stevia, which may not be for all, but has been a great help to me.

*  Avoid drinking calories as much as you can. If drinking alcohol, can be a very low calorie endeavor with some mint and rum and limes and stevia. :)

*  Don't be afraid of lifting weights--especially if you're a girl. You're not going to turn into the Hulk. You will

*  Had a bad day?  Don't beat yourself up!  Just log the calories and don't use it as an excuse to binge tomorrow.

*  Don't feel it's impossible.  I used to have NO ENERGY to go to the gym.  It's sort of a catch 22 that losing weight and working out gives me more energy!  Even 60 lbs ago, I look forward to my 5:30 Zumba class. :)

1347895617.0,100xo6,To the obese lurkers out there who want to do it but you just can't seem to start. (Warning: This is a long post),OpusThePenguin,479,90,97,"I hope this doesn't turn into a jumbled ramble where my point gets lost but I wanted to get this out there and hope it reached someone.  The message I hope to get through boils down to this:  Even if you are obese you can do it

My story is pretty typical, school took up my time and my eating habits got not better.  As life went on I got bigger and bigger topping out at 371lbs.  About 5 years ago I started to lose the weight and in the next 1 1/2 year I lost 150lbs.  Then life got complicated and I let back in old habits and put all the weight, and possibly more, back on in 1 1/2 years.  So last October I decided it was time to do it again and do it permanently.

I just remember, how low I felt about my weight, how much I liked myself and my life but hated how I looked. I have stood in the mirror looking at myself with utter disgust; I have avoided swimming, playing and enjoying my life with kids because I was too embarrassed to do it, or just couldn't keep up.  I've cried in the shower because of my weight, and even though I would never have done it I even fantasized about how if I was in an accident or stabbed I could ask them to take the fat out and it would give me a head start on the weight loss.

That's all I needed right, I could do that right?  In reality, I couldn't have.  I would just put it back on because of the way I looked at eating and food.    I think about myself and I think I was waiting for a wakeup call, something to let me know how far I had fallen.  The Ironic thing about losing weight and gaining weight is your mind tricks you.  As my weight crept up and up I could look at myself in the mirror and think, I'm no worse than I was 10lbs ago, 30lbs ago, 50lbs ago.  Sure I hated my own reflection, but to do a side by side it's like night and day.   I’ve come to realise that I think I was waiting for a heart attack.  That would be serious enough to wake me up and realise I needed to do something.  Right?  I mean I couldn’t make excuses for myself after having a heart attack..could I?  I would have survived a heart attack

One of the things about losing weight, I need to change now!’.  It can start with a walk.  It can start with learning about food and proper weight loss.  It continues when you choose to walk again, and teach yourself what a proper portion size is.  When you take a few minutes to look at what you are actually putting in your body.  There probably isn’t going to be a thunderous moment when you realise your life has changed, but eventually you’ll look back and see all the small changes that have made things so different for you now.
If you are waiting, if you are obese and you desire to be more of you in less of you, if you’ve lurked on /r/loseit and wondered how these people have done it, how you wish you could be one of those people, how you wish you had the willpower to do it, and wondered what sort of drastic, inspirational thing happened to them that could happened to you; well then it’s time to start.
Start reading and learning about eating properly, now.  Not tomorrow, not next week because someone is having a birthday on Friday, or because you need to get new groceries.  It’s time to dive into it.
My life is considerably better already, I went to a water park with my kids and went down the slides with them.  I have muscles.
It’s hard, but keep going .  It is hard and it’s so completely and utterly worth it.  It really, truly is.

**About me:**
I was overweight all through school and never really tried or had thought about losing weight.
I was the token fat guy in class and honestly didn’t mind. 




[Here is me at 16 2008](http://i.imgur.com/cNsfB.jpg)



Slowly I crept away from friends and lost motivation to do anything but play video games all day every day. 




[This was me at the end of 2010](http://imgur.com/WeUbn.jpg)



Just hit 18 and instead of partying/socializing



I started having pretty bad health problems, headaches ect.
Even after the hints from my doctor to lose weight



My sister finally gave me that motivation I needed to start. She went on a diet 8 months before me, still obese, just thinking ""one day I wish somebody would say that to me”. It finally gave me the motivation to start. (she ended up losing 55lbs)




[Here is me at my peak of 230lbs



I woke up that day




**My progress.**



**April 2011**: 230 - 200lbs    40 - 35.4 waist



Didn’t do any exercise in the first month, best $40 I've spent. 




**May/June 2011**: 200 - 180lbs   35.4  - 33.7 waist



Still watching my diet I started cardio, moving away from the computer games and started socializing. I bought an exercise bike and set it up in front of the computer. It’s amazing how many miles you can do while watching a movie without realizing, even a slow pedal I was doing 2 - 3 miles during a 20 minute show.




**July 2011**: 180 - 170lbs    33.7 - 33



July was my favorite month during my journey




[Photo of me before and after the hair cut](http://i.imgur.com/gvzE1.jpg)



Starting to get to the point where I enjoyed exercising more than playing the computer and knew I had finally hit that stride I needed.



I fell in love with salad/veggies and had completely moved away from fast food. I ate as much steak/chicken as a could. I could no longer eat fish though



**August - November**: 170 - 140lbs    33 - 29.3



I finally hit my goal weight of 150lbs in October.

Here is where I went wrong, by the end of November I was 140 and started having people tell me I was too skinny.



In 8 Months I went from people telling me I was overweight to telling me I was too skinny.  So I set a new goal weight of 165.

I’m still doing my heavy workouts 5/7 days week and on a good protein diet slowly bulking up. I still play computer games but only casually and my life no longer revolves around them.



In the past year I’ve only been to the gym once




My only regrets are I didn’t take enough before photos



Also regret not lifting during the weight loss




Sites I used for inspiration:

Awesome free plans

When I started off exercising I had no idea where to start or how




and of course http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/



My sister gave me the initial motivation to start. But you guys, the tips! You guys are the best inspiration, thank you for helping me change my life and hopefully I’ve given you a bit of motivation.

Hi! I am a Special Education Teacher in Arkansas. In late May 2011

I started to change my life in June 2011. I joined a gym. It was slow going at first. I really could physically do no more than three days a week for 30 minutes. I started out just going to the gym three days a week for 30 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical. Gradually

I hit my goal weight of 145 pounds in November of 2012. I am currently 135 pounds. I am not looking to necessarily lose anymore

I started getting into jogging in June 2012 and presently I have done twelve 5Ks and two Half-marathons.  I started trying to work up to a 5K that summer of 2012. Jogging my first mile was a killer and took about a month to work up to it. Then the rest came pretty easily in the scheme of things.

I completely changed my eating habits August 2012. I measure everything and really try to get the most for my calories.

Well

I started the semester at ~212, watch what I ate and establish a regular schedule for going to the gym. At first, I did a mixture of weights and cardio and found some pretty great success in that. I tend to stick to a low-carb diet. I dropped below 200lbs for the first time since high school sometime in early March. Lately, I've been focusing a lot on cardio, but once I hit my goal weight (~175), I'll begin lifting again.

Here's the last two and a half months by the statistics:

* Height: 6'1""

* Weight: 217lbs ---&gt; 188 lbs

* Pant size: 36-38in. in the waist ---&gt; 33in. in the waist.

* Shirt size: XL ---&gt; L

A few things that I found helpful:

* Buy a water bottle! I have a 1L Nalgene bottle with me at all times. I try to drink at least 3-4L of water/day. It'll keep you feeling fuller.

* Cut soda and sweet tea out. I didn't have much of a problem with this before, or hot (unsweet) tea with every meal.

* Count calories, I used MyFitnessPal to count calories and be certain that I was at a deficit.

* Don't ""eat back"" calories. Just because the treadmill told you that you just burned 300 calories doesn't mean that you should eat those back throughout the day. In fact

* Sweets are a treat, not only did I feel more energized, but I didn't really have the cravings for sweets anymore. You grow the appetites you feed and starve the ones you ignore. 

* Find a workout buddy. Running/lifting alone is (for me, and focused on the goal.

Here is the album of my progress: http://imgur.com/a/U9VXS

I've been overweight for most of my life, and through becoming more active in the summer and fall of last year. I went through a difficult time in August/September and ended up losing another 25-30lbs within a couple months. Since then, I've joined a gym and been very conscious of the calories of food and what I eat. I've given up soda and diet soda (phenylalanine does not agree with my stomach for some reason), and I've stopped eating fast food entirely. I do cardio and weight machines at the gym, although the cardio is a struggle some days. 

For me, or anything like that. They really just hurt my self-esteem and made my opinion of myself even lower.

I've been trying to get away from that mindset though, and I do enjoy the post-workout mental resolution. And reading all the stories on here helps me feel less alone. Knowing that so many of you have had similar or worse struggles, and have persevered, helps me keep some perspective.

Now I am ready to kick start/ restart my weight loss journey.

A little bit of background: My daughter was born in May 2011. Before her, so I didn't watch my diet much -- if I gained a bit of weight, I just ran more. I was never *super skinny* either, but weight certainly wasn't on my mind. But when I was pregnant with my daughter, I gained a TON of weight. The combination of stopping running during pregnancy, plus eating more, caused me to be left in the ""obese"" category for my height after her birth. After 9 months of attempting to lose weight without watching my diet, and I came to learn that diet was more important than exercise when it came to weight loss!

So I got really strict about a 1200-net calorie diet, but I found that on days when I went for a run, I preferred to keep my energy up by taking in more calories. I didn't pay much attention to carbs, etc... I ate what I wanted, just in moderation and tried to eliminate really ""bad"" foods like fast food and candy. In approximately 4 months of just counting calories and with the help of /r/loseit, I lost 30 lbs. I was still 10 lbs over my goal weight, and then I got pregnant again!

I decided that I would take a ""break"" from my diet while pregnant again. I knew I would see some amount of setback

First off - sorry so long.

Before picture: taken during family photos
After picture: taken at Disney World


Hi Loseit.  I started my weight loss process almost three years ago.  Since I have kept the weight off for almost two years

I hope this post helps somebody else.  My weight loss and lifestyle changes really helped to bring me out of a negative time in my life

The most important thing I learned about weight loss?  The process to lose weight is not unique in most people

I was 26 years old, and new house.  I was on a strict diet of everything in excess.  I like to eat a lot at a time, and love sweets of all kind.  I also worked the majority of the waking day to ensure that my program was successful.  I saw fast food and the wrong foods as the only option with my busy schedule.  And that is how I became over 250lbs.  

My motivation came from a few places:


   * I was 26 years old
   * I was at a size 38 pant
   * I started shopping for vitamins and personal care products on a health site.  I wanted to share this with people
   * A custodian at my school came to me on a Monday, and said I would talk to the kids about it.  
   * I hated how I looked


I started a few days before my 27th birthday.  My process came from a variety of sources, but here's some tough love.  I was reading an article written by financial expert Dave Ramsey on reducing debt.  Dave's strategy is to snowball debt by paying off the lowest balance first, and then then using the monthly payment from the paid off bill to add to the monthly payment of the second highest bill, and so on.  I remember Dave's quote going something like this: ""Now you might be thinking that the better way to go about this is to pay off the highest interest loan first in order to save money.  And I'll say this - if you were so good with numbers, you wouldn't be reading my article.""   Not trying to be a jerk, but that hit home.

Feeling like I had no motivation and no place to get help with my problem

I read the article, I decided to only take parts of it.  In short, I did a lower carb diet with a cheat day that turned into a low carb diet with cheat meals on a cheat day.  I have always been able to lose 10-15 lbs on a low carb diet, but didn't have the discipline to stick with it.  I felt that a planned ""cheat day"" would help.  I also ate high fat to feel full longer.  I'm sure it's been said to death, but eating fat doesn't make you fat.  And my cholesterol numbers improved, so that worked in my favor as well.

I also felt that I had four options:


  1. Do nothing
  2. Eat better
  3. Exercise
  4. Eat better

I choice option two.  I realized that eating better is a huge change

In more detail

Phase 1:


   * Starting weight of 250 lbs.  I downloaded the Loseit App (I love how it gave me badges/""achievements"" like it was a game).  Logged everything I ate.
   * Tuesday-Sunday I ate 100 grams of carbs or less.  I didn't count calories, anything.  Just carbs.  This allowed me certain fast food items.  Every morning I had a Big and Toasty sandwich from Dunkin' Donuts, or I had a couple of servings of some cereal.  Tried to eat within an hour of waking.  
   * Switched to drinking only water
   * Monday was my ""cheat day.""  I picked Monday because I felt it was my most stressful.  I eventually moved to Wednesdays (my longest day) and finally settled on Saturdays due to social allowances. 

Under 100 carbs a day helped me to lose 25lbs with visible results in about two months.  I was feeling better, so I decided to enter into the next phase.

Phase 2:


   * Current weight was 225lbs.  I kept going with Loseit.  Had my 25lb badge
   * Sunday-Friday I ate 70 carbs or less.  Still didn't count anything else.  This still allowed plenty of wiggle room
   * Cheat days were Saturday.  In this phase, though, and wouldn't allow another one until six consecutive days passed.

Under 70 carbs a day helped me to lose 20 pounds in almost two months.  Sitting at 205lbs

Phase 3


   * Current weight was 205.  Loseit was still very helpful with logging food.
   * I switched to 50 carbs or less every day
   * Completely took soda of all forms out of my diet.  I only drank coffee, but learned the pattern of the tiles behind the urinal perfectly.
   * Cheat days continued, and I had no desire to see junk food after a cheat day.

Under 50 carbs a day: pant size was now a 34 if I sucked it in really well.  Weight was sitting at 190.  My goal was 180lbs (my high school weight).  I felt so good now

Phase 4


   * current weight was 190.  I still used Loseit
   * I reduced carb intake to less than 35 carbs a day.  I could still do a sandwich if I wanted to, so I tried to avoid it all together.  
   * Cheat days continued, 3, 400 carbs.  Felt terrible after them.  Still kept on track.


Under 35 carbs a day: I could squeeze into a 32 (my high school pant size).  Finally got down to my first goal of 180 within a month and a half.  This was the hardest phase so far

I kept going at it, but I had exercise slightly to get there (I took hour long walks every day…nothing too major).  I now currently sit at 170-175, and try to stay here.  My danger weight is 180, and I avoid ever going above that.  Certain brands I can fit into a 30 pant size (down from 38), and my average shirt size is medium, although some smalls fit me.  

If you've made it through the novel above



   * Persistence
   * Work for small changes.  Losing even one pound is worth it
   * My work schedule was still hectic for a while, no bun.  Jimmy John's Unwiches (get a card; after you purchase so many, you get one free).  Wendy's chicken salads were a staple of mine, and Culver's burgers, with cheese, no bun, extra mayo.  I want one now.  At home, all vegetables
   * We all know how to lose weight.  Most of us are not more special or unique in that science and body chemistry does not apply to us.  
   * Log ALL food.
   * Buy a Brita Bottle or Brita pitcher.  Never pass up a bathroom.
   * Don't tell people you're losing weight.  Just don't do it.  Trust me.  
   * Don't tell people how you're trying to lose weight unless you want puzzled looks
   * Don't use special events as an excuse to eat junk.  I skipped cake on my birthday
   * Scales are not an enemy, measuring arms, legs, waist, etc.
   * Eating healthier or real food might seem like it costs more money
   * Water, except for V8.
   * I associated the word ""snack"" with pre-school or elementary school, I should have the willpower or discipline to hold off on eating if I was a little ""uncomfortable.""  This took a bit to get used to.  If you do what I did, it's ok to eat larger meals as long as you are staying within your counts.  
   * Too much fiber is a bad thing.  Trust me on this one as well.
   * Stare at yourself in the mirror
   * Don't expect an athletic body without doing some work

For anyone doubting that they can do it, and I want all of you to have your own positive story.  Let me know how I can help.

First picture is a costume party

I had always been a chubby/overweight girl. I was never terribly happy about it

**FOOD**: One particular ""tip"" that actually made me do this was actually a comment someone made here on /r/loseit which was to plan out calories for the day. I had tried calorie counting before, etc.) but I always ate too much and too often (often out of boredom). Planning helped me mentally control my intake and it was surprisingly easy for me.

I started calorie-counting at the end of April 2011 using Fat Secret. I will be the first to admit that I'm not a huge fan of its interface but by the time I had figured that out I was used to it

**EXERCISE**: In May I started the Couch to 5k program and made it through by June. I kept with the running through mid-July before I stopped. I just didn't find it fun. In early September I got a bike and started riding to/from work (~5 miles) 3-4 times a week. I stopped in October when the rainy season hit. In December I started group fitness classes and have been doing that ever since. It started out with just Zumba 2-4 times a week, etc.) but Zumba and BodyPump are the only two I've been consistent about.

**WEIGHT LOSS**: My weight loss was remarkably consistent. I recorded daily using the Hacker's Diet tracking program. For 175-&gt;145 I was losing a consistent 5lb/month. It slowed down for 145-&gt;135, it was all diet. My initial goal was 135lb but the closer I got to it the more I realized that I wouldn't be satisfied with that, which is when I changed my goal to 125lb. I'm not 100% satisfied yet but I'm changing my focus more toward fitness goals and body re-composition than strict weight-loss. Because I focused mostly on diet I did end up skinny-fat.

**FOR THE LADIES**: I changed my birth control from NuvaRing to Mirena (IUD) in June 2011. I did not notice a change in weight-loss. Also

There were some bumps along the way but overall I found that losing weight doesn't have to be difficult. In fact I'm much more worried about moving over to fitness because I already know how to lose weight,False,,t5_2rz8w,True,,50lbs,t3_q8t3v

I won't say after because I haven't quite gotten down to where I'd like to be.  

Weight loss started with portion control and teaching myself how to recognize when I was actually hungry and when I was sufficiently full.  I then slowly started to incorporate exercise like walking

In August 2012 I joined a CrossFit box and showed up for classes sporadically, family functions, and work.  

I decided in January to make a real commitment to my health and well being and began a paleo diet and consistent training 6 times a week.  

I'm far from perfect on the diet but I'm still seeing great results.

So what I've been doing? Honestly, basic calorie counting. I'm nowhere near keto, I'm not even low carb, I'm just lower carb than I used to be.

As for how many calories, I further dropped it to 1600 and that's my upper limit now. Practically speaking, I usually hang around 1400 these days, mostly because I don't have the appetite for more.

During the warmer days, but I haven't been very active during the winter, other than some minor weight lifting. Now that it's finally getting warmer again, I plan to up my activity by a lot and lose the last few pounds I need in the first half of this year.

As for the numbers, so I should probably lose 10-20 lbs still, depending on how much muscle I plan to put on (and I do plan to put on muscle). I've been losing 20+ a month when I started and this has been steadily dropping. Now I lose about 6-8 lbs a month, and it's not as linear as it used to be, but I have yet to experience a plateau longer than 2 and a half weeks.

Other than that, my hormones got rebalanced and my heart is now in the nice 50-70 bpm range (it used to be 110-130). Everything is just great.

Been over weight my whole life, helped and I lost 20lbs last summer. I also stopped drinking soda. But, when I went back to finish school I stopped losing weight. I graduated in December 2011 and I got a gym membership for christmas. I sort of just dicked around not doing much with it until March. I started going to the gym religiously, for the first 2 months I went everyday. I got a trainer to show me the ropes so I didn't hurt myself. Then I cut back only going 3-4 times a week. I ate healthier too. I never cut things out of my diet because I would end up just craving the things more.  I just ate in moderation and with better choices. I did cut back heavily on carbs and sugar. Since march I lost the last 80lbs. Now my goal is to put on some muscle which I regret not doing during the weight loss. I did cardio for the most part, i ran and swam, adding some HIIT and lifting every now and then. I lift more these days with still a lot of cardio.

**1. Read the FAQ.**

Yes

**2. Starvation Mode**

I swear by MyFitnessPal- for the most part.  However, just there to prevent them from getting sued.  Starvation mode takes more than a few days to get into, and frankly, if you were getting all of the other vitamins, nutrients, and minerals you need, it would take even longer.  The posts about ""I only ate 1000 calories today, guys.

**3. Weight Training**

And girls, you probably WILL gain a few pounds- but pounds of muscle- healthy, sexy, awesome muscle!  

**4. I Can't....**

Nope, a defeatist attitude will creep into everything you do.  But then again, so will a positive one.  Don't be afraid to leave your comfort zone.  If you spend your whole life thinking about all the things you can't or won't do, you will never know what you are truly capable of.

**5. Motivation**

I'm gonna leave this one in the hands of a professional.  These are the truest words I have ever read

‎""The problem, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.

For me, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.""

I think that it's safe to say that I've been overweight almost all of my life, things just got way out of control. I went from being around 270 lbs in January 2011 to 310 lbs in May of 2011. I still remember that morning in May when I got on that scale and saw ""310.2"" on the scale; I mean, I knew I was overweight, but this really cut to the core. I felt so disgusting, and It made my already low self esteem plummet even further. So then began my journey to lose the weight

I know that this isn't ""safe"" behavior so I've been really trying to just breathe and let it flow.

And now for today's progress picture. I am currently sitting at 166.7lbs. Not too sure how much more I want to lose

Okay so.. How did I do it?! I started off by just walking and ""watching what I ate"" that got me from 260lbs to around 235lbs. Starting last summer I began a keto-based diet. It did wonders for me and I will never bash the diet. I found that the more I lost the more I became obsessed with carbs to the point that I would forgo all social events

At around 180lbs I started to just count calories, and just exercise. I am now 166lbs! I go to the gym 5 times a week and do all different classes. Hip-Hop, Zumba, Pure Strength (I hate it so much, it's so hard!), Ultimate Stretch, etc. I have fun in those classes and it doesn't seem like exercise at all.

I started out dating my wife about 10 years ago, in which I carried over the same metabolism, devouring fast food every day. Fast forward a few years, I was clocking in at around 245. I started last year, just cutting down on soda, stopped eating fast food, and tried to keep my bigger meals to earlier in the day (breakfast/lunch). Beyond that, and eventually started exercising more, and this looks like it will continue into the winter months with us more than likely purchasing snowshoes soon.

My wife has been a huge influence in this, and still going. My nephew in-law last christmas asked me why I was fat (he's a little kid, and yes I was rather large still at the time), and that kicked me into gear as well. Fast forward to now, and I'm down to about 190. I've got another 20 to 30 pounds to go, but the end is in sight.

Today is my 6 year anniversary with my wife

I love him and he is a great person and part of my motivation for losing it. All things considered though i deserve more. 

So today i won a pat on the back becuase i used to eat when i was upset but instead i walked and did errands and cleaned. Today i did not go to the dunkin donuts and get something sweet to make me feel better. Today i won because i respected myself and ended something unhealthy and i didnt hurt myself by eating something i should not have or overeating.

1344272538.0,xrumu,Surpassed my goals and expectations by losing 60lbs! Progress pics,dahlit,425,58,98,"(Sorry if this is long...)

For starters, and have struggled with my weight all my life. Between bad eating habits, warped body image from mom (""You could be so pretty if you lost weight!"" and other such crap encouragement) and a sedentary lifestyle I was resolved that my big body was just my lot in life and that's the way it would always be. It wasn't until I broke 200lbs that I knew I had to do something, and I didn't do anything until I was over 210 and finally found the motivation to change EVERYTHING about how I eat and exercise. Eat less, move more became my moto. 

First of all, about my goals or my progress for the first few months. My husband caught on pretty quickly though, since I was turning my nose up to McDonald's runs and choosing salads over chicken strips. I took it one meal at a time, and tried not to get too down on myself if I slipped up. I successfully weened myself off soda, candy and fast food, which used to be my biggest vices. That alone helped with my first goal of getting under 200lbs. I kept setting myself 10lb goals, with no big time lines to meet them

I successfully weened myself off of World of Warcraft as well, haven't washed my hair in days. I literally have no excuses not to work out anymore, and I've replaced my go-to game with Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 which helped me step up my work out and really motivates me to keep going. This last month I've been counting calories and keeping it around 1200 calories a day (down from 800 calories a meal!) 

This all started with a New Years resolution

I have such a new outlook on food and nutrition that it seems second nature now and I see no problem with continuing this trend and getting even fitter. Next up is some Kickboxing lessons and to get myself running more. Also


I still hate that my mom was right

I was a typical fat kid... got picked on, and the only thing that kept me from offing myself was the fear of death.  

Skip ahead a few years.  This wasn't the digital age, I smoked a lot of weed, I did other various drugs, but not to an extreme.  I was unhappy, and I was always felt alone.  

I didn't have many friends in high school, he left town for a year or so, and I somehow bumped into him somewhere when he moved back, we hung out, got wasted together a few times, and fell right back into like we were in high school.  This guy would turn out to be a life saver, and to this day I am closer to him than I am my own brother.  Through all the bad days, all the rejections from chicks, 225lbs

One day he asked me if I wanted to start working out.  HELL YEA I DO. We started lifting weights, and I was still drinking heavily.  But I didn't care about that, I had a new friend, who was a real friend.  He mentioned martial arts... I had always been interested, but lets be real, what teenage boy isn't.  Here comes the life saving part, I couldn't afford to go to this martial arts gym.  It was an hour away, which I was already paying at the YMCA.  My objection didn't fly, but we did it.  We stuck with it, and took Muay Thai and Brazilian Jui jitsu.  I quit lifting weights

Over the first few years I slowly lost about fifty pounds.  I still tried to stay away from cameras, but I decided that wasn't going to last long.  I started eating better, but still not nearly good enough, and I started training more, and harder.  Then I picked up one of [these](http://i.imgur.com/C8weX.jpg).  Holy shit if this is not one of the best things every.  I lost about 20 lbs in two weeks by doing [swings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XjJjLc7NE).  This lit a fire under my ass, and I wanted to fight bad.  I scheduled an MMA fight, didn't have to worry about weight because I was heavyweight, and I was definitely in that range.  I did fight training for an hour and a half a day, but sadly, so I took a short break. Back to about 240 :( 

When I saw the scale a month later, but not at a fighting pace, and sticking with kettlebells.  2005ish, I looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vVZuI.jpg). Stayed around 220 or 230.  I ran some, but running has always hurt my knees, so I would basically just run/walk a mile or so.  This is where I truly started to be happy.  I could do things that I could never do, like a pull up.  It was only one, and that feeling was amazing. 

So I hear that a bar in town is going to have some boxing matches, I took to my friends garage, (by this time I only traveled to the gym like once a month, life happens) and worked on boxing, I changed my diet, and I dropped about 25 pounds, ended up fighting at 201.  I won, and it made me more determined than ever. [Here] is me

After this, just not as hard, so I just stayed at around 205.  I felt skinny, and to be honest I didn't think I could lose much more weight.  By this time I was better at kickboxing than my big friend, and others at the gym that I had thought would always be better than me.  Everybody at the gym was always motivational, so they gave me the confidence I needed to just keep going.  I decided to fight again, and I didn't pay attention to my weight much, so I really just had to not gain any.  My workout was still mostly Marital Art and Kettlebell based.  You can see the fight [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tiAvgBwyk&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plcp). 

This is where I did a change up.  I wanted to try and fight at 185.  I felt a little slow, and RINGS! I love gymnast rings.  I started eating about 90% paleo, drink 100grams of protein a day, and I was always hungry.  I dropped my fight training for this to about 20 minutes a day.  4 rounds hitting thai pads, 3 minutes per round, 1 minute break, but you're going balls to the wall for that three minutes.  [example:me hitting pads a few months ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juzkSy0aLMc&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plcp).  I also started lifting free weights at the Y again, and speed.
End result

After this fight

Wake up
Thirty minutes of light cardio
Two hours or so later I usually eat again
Two hours later a protein drink
I lift weights in the middle of the day.
After is a random food. I'm always hungry after the gym.  Usually eat about three hundred calories or so.  Sometimes its fruit
Cardio for about 30 minutes
Dinner- Usually consists of plenty of meat and vegetables.  Very few starches.  I almost never eat baked potatoes or corn anymore.  Sweet potatoes and Avocados are almost daily.
Anywhere from two to four hours after that I usually eat a bowl of cereal and go to bed.  

And yes
""FOOD IS ENERGY
 

I lost weight on accident, because this guy is a Muay Thai instructor, and I weighed ten pounds less than him.  The beating that occurred can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgqF-2_QMY&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=7&amp;feature=plcp).  

That's pretty much my story.  I plan on fighting agian, and I still train, just don't throw punches with my right hand very much.

* I was eating about 3000 calories a day broken into two large meals.
* Of my ~3000 calories a day about ~800 of them were from drinks (soda, ect.)
* I did not prepare anything I ate, frozen pizza, ect.
* About half my meals were eaten in my car.

I'm really glad I did this because

1. No more meals in the car.
1. Only drink water and the occasional diet soda.
1. Eat more frequently. I have suspicion the reason my meals were so large is because I was letting myself get crazy with hunger.
1. Try to prepare as much of the food I eat as possible.

So now I have a plan and hopefully following these rules along with a strict 1700 calorie limit and a little exercise this attempt will finally be the time I lose weight.

When I was around 15/16

It's been 8 years since my mom got that present from my dad. She was 42 at the time. In December of 2011, my mother stated that she was once during this journey a size 6 and felt really comfortable there. She hopes to go back. Still though....a size 8 to 6 doesn't seem nearly as drastic as size 22 to 8. 

- Why is her weight loss different from others?
I was browsing r/loseit before posting this and I saw a lot of young adults/teenagers posting. I commend so many of yours' transformations and I am so proud of you. I've never been extremely heavy. I had my high school chunk that I got rid of via exercise, a 21 year old is not built like a 42 year old. A 46 year old can't look at a 30 year old and say 'I want those results'...because your bodies aren't the same. My mom wasn't young when she started this. She was 42. Her young bouncy body? It was gone. To lose as much weight as she did at her age makes me feel like this is inspirational to those who aren't 30-25 and younger. If she can do it (and no, she's not a stick thin woman - she has curves), then you can too, right?

-The Result?
My mom's happy. She's happier than she was. Almost every picture of her since her weight loss is her smiling a big healthy smile. This didn't just change her attitude either. Inspired by her personal trainer and her newfound love for working out



I hope my mom's story inspires some of you as much as she inspires me on a daily basis. I love her so much and am incredible proud of her!


(Found some grammar errors. As an ex-journalism major


**OP NOTE: I showed my mom all of your comments and my mom is so grateful for all the positive feedback, and the best gym ever - Fitness 19. Yeah, she's plugging her work a bit, but Fitness 19 is where she started this journey as well. She loves all the positiveness towards this as sometimes she can still be self-conscious and even broke down crying in my arms with tears of joy and gratitude. You quite possibly made her week.

I (mostly) avoid all junk food, sports drinks, or most anything other than water, black coffee, unsweetened almond milk and pure coconut water. Desserts are now an occasional treat instead of a nightly occurrence.

-I sleep 6-8 hours a night

-I now only drink alcohol on special occasions

-I run. A lot. It started off as a cheap and quick way to burn calories and has become my favourite hobby. I've started with zero endurance and now I've finished a 10k

-When traveling around my city

As of this spring I weigh 185lbs, push-ups, chin-ups). I've only made small changes that are sustainable for life.

So I eased into keto

I'd say we've been super strict with absolutely no bad stuff for about a year now.

I aim for 1700 calories a day but I'm not very strict about it. I don't think he counts calories. 

I've been doing p90x since I started in September of 2011. I just started my 5th round Jan 2nd, while these last two rounds I didn't take time off between.

He was doing body-weight exercises and a bit of running when he first started

The biggest improvements (other than self esteem boosts): *I used to suffer from intense migraine headaches... Ever since I was 12 year old

A) Cutting sugar and carbs B) Taking a mulitvitamin and C) Exercising

Knee problems run in my family (even in non-overweight members) and I used to have really bad back

The increase in energy level for the both of us is incredible

Fixing keto meals at home is really saving us a lot of money, but for what you get when you ask for ""no bread/rice/sauce/etc"" I would just rather spend the amount of money and get twice as much food.... and no tips. But when we do eat out, we can almost anywhere and not feel limited.

Cheat days? We used to treat ourselves with our favorite Biggby (coffee chain from michigan) blended carmel-coffee drinks, and every.single.food we cheated with, was SO not worth it. The internet is a great tool for finding keto snacks and replacements that I swear feel like cheating, but aren't! My weakness is ice cream, so when I feel like a treat, I make protein ice cream with heavy cream. We really enjoy the food we eat. A Domino's pizza just doesn't hold up to our Meat-za. ----both of us agreed we will probably never go back to eating un-keto. Especially after watching documentaries like ""Fathead"" and doing research... and just seeing the results. Even our dog eats grain-free high-fat food. lol.

I used to worry a lot (even before I lost anything) about loose skin. I figured that I would look like a flying squirrel or have to go in for surgery... but it seems that with time (and being in my 20's still) I don't mind waiting a year or two for the skin to catch up. Even now- my arms are kind of floppy, not just staying loose. I'm sure lifting weights is really helping with that. Anyway, I'd rather have loose skin that can be held in with some Spanx than the 111 lbs back on me and look ""fuller.""

My husband has maintained his weight for a year now

When I started I didn't have anyone to look to that was over 300lbs

This is seriously the thing that made me get p90x and start working out... and eating better. I should probably tell him he was the reason I figured I would try it out. [Tommy Mygrant's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEjw4km3KKE) p90x testimony

""I couldn't do 20% of what they were doing. But Tony said do your best and forget the rest, that's what I did. I can struggle as much as I want in my living room. No one's watching.""

I'm just thinking that maybe there's someone out there that will see me or my husband and say ""hey

I started off at 286 lbs (130 kgs), but looking at my [progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/46kCu) (Bra and panties, NSFW! Terrible pics anyway, but w/e) made me realise I've actually lost quite a bit in the last couple of months! The before pics were taken around the 15th of August this year, and I took the during pics this afternoon. Just wanted to share. :)

Like I said, because if I didn't I probably would've given up after a week or something.

But anyway

* Month 1: This is going to sound so lame, lost around 17 lbs. It was hard, but really doable. 

* Month 2: Started doing C25K on top of the walking. Felt like I was going to die after the first day, but oh well. Lowered my cal intake to 1200/day.

* Month 3: Cal intake around 1300-1400/day, I'm constantly cold now! People always laugh when I say this, but on a really cold day I actually miss those extra lbs... At least they kept me warm!

A regular day for me

* Breakfast: Three slices of wholewheat bread, to eat at work (chambermaid at a hotel). Pretty physically exhausting job, so I really need to eat something when it's lunchtime!

* Lunch: Usually a salad with a bit of grilled chicken. Salad mostly consists of a diced tomato, I'll have some bread or a piece of fruit like a banana. 

* Dinner: Anything! Really depends on my mood. Sometimes pasta with chicken and peas, a bit of meat and fresh veggies. I'm not a great cook... Again: water. 3 glasses.

* Snack: Usually a bit of yoghurt with fruit. Kiwi, plums... Whatever.

So... This was my story! Loseit is an awesome community with great people who are all equally freakin' badass

EDIT Woops

EDIT Haha oh my god guys, you're all so amazing and supportive, it's crazy! On my way from work now, will check out all your lovely comments when I'm home. :)",,False,,1353767842.0,t3_13okd9
