Now, and cause them to glitch and behave erratically. These glitches can be quite entertaining. Even if you weren't initially wondering and just happened to see this post, it's certainly worth a try. I'll be giving a step-by-step tutorial on how to use it effectively, because, without proper information, it's not easy to figure out.

First and foremost, there's tutorials all over on how to use them. 

Now, ""save corrupted ROM to."" This is just where a seperate corrupted file will be put by the program, so that it doesn't permanently corrupt your original ROM. Then, click the ""enable"" box beneath ""byte corruption."" This is where the fun happens. There are three main sections to this, that are all essential to a proper corruption. They are as follows:

Range

This is the start byte and end byte. Basically, but just corrupts everything after a certain point. Say the start byte was 3000. The corruption would start at the 3000th byte in the code, and not change anything before that. The start byte should be far enough forward so as not to effect anything involving the actual startup of the game, but not so far as to not be visible. For NES, I reccomend around 9000, while for SNES, around 23000. However

Corrupt every ____.

This is the most temperamental part of the corruption, then too much corruption will happen, rendering the game unable to run. Too high, and there will be little to no fun glitchiness at all. As said before, this is all about finding a happy medium. For NES, around 900 is good, while for SNES, 1981-1987 are earlier

add/shift/replace

For this, or odd numbers will behave more temperamentally than even, small, or positive numbers, use this to your advantage. I reccomend a range of 1-10 and their negatives for this. Any higher usually harms the game too much.

Also

Just keep tweaking based on my advice until you find a good spot, alter the ""corrupt every"" number by a small increment, and run over and over, to explore all the different effects you can see. The shift number could also be changed by one or two if you pleased.

That's all. I would be happy to answer any additional questions in the comments. Thank you!

There has been some discussion over what content is allowable / what submission rules are. The subreddit was created with the intention of posting funny game glitches and physics-bending moments, **non-glitchy physics / graphics can still be good content**. 

My only concern is that posting will become too generic. What does everyone else think? The ""game glitches"" rule right now allows for a fairly broad range of posts ... **what guidelines could we instate to keep the posting queue from looking like r/gaming**? This subreddit is still in its infancy

As far as **miscellaneous rules** go

* Post the game title in brackets at the beginning of the title
* Source the video your gif is from  
* If your gif is OC

If you have any other suggestions
