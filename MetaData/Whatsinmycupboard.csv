Dad loves cooking and as much as I enjoy the meals he makes it leaves me very little opportunity to make anything of my own but now I've got the kitchen to myself and I'm ready to make something tasty that can hopefully impress my parents when they come back.

Only problem is that I've been left (what seems to me) a very ragtag mixture of ingredients - that's why I need your guys help! So without further ado

* 20 rashers of bacon

* A big ass chorizo
* Snap peas

* Egg noodles
* Conchiglie pasta
* Tinned chopped tomatoes
* Chillies
* Refried beans
* Milky bar desserts (shit is SO cash)
* 1 jar of hot doritos salsa
* 1 jar of bbq doritos salsa
* 1 bag of cool original (cool ranch in US I think) doritos
* 1 bag of chili heatwave (don't know US name for these) doritos
* Lettuce
* Red bull
* 6pts of milk
* Greek yoghurt
* Crunchy nut cereal
* Roast potatoes
* Carrot and swede mash
* 3 tins of tuna

Sorry if the list isn't that well ordered - it was written from memory (at library just now). I *can* go to the shop if there is some dish screaming out of the list that I'm missing the vital ingredient for but I'd rather not as I don't drive.

1357159378.0,15uf0q,Need help planning some meals for 2 for the weekend and freezer meals for the future.,sunkan,6,2,4,"Hey guys
So, so it's okay.  My boyfriend is coming back from winter break this weekend (we're uni students), so I'll need to cook for the both of us for a few days.  He has a meal plan, so he can swipe me into the school cafeterias to even out some meals, but the school cafs don't open until next Wednesday.  Also, dorm food can get kind of boring, so I wanted to make some freezer meals (homemade tv dinners type of deal).  

I have some meals planned out in my head

**Grains:**

* Short grain rice
* [A plethora of pastas (all the boxes are full)](http://imgur.com/puDnH) - i already finished off the bowtie though. and i also have some piccolini, and some soba noodles.
* [Some steamer bag rice](http://imgur.com/QUIMs)
* [This ""germinated brown rice"" that I don't know how to cook...](http://imgur.com/q0w5z) - so
* some mini wheat croissants
* Total Whole Grain cereal

**Dairy**

* Sour cream (2- 8 oz tubs of Daisy)
* 8oz block of colby jack cheese
* 32oz almond milk

~~note: i'm slightly lactose intolerant, half&amp;half, or soymilk) for free (up to 24oz) from work. ~~ &lt;- as I wrote this post, a coupon for a free gallon of milk from my local superstore was released.  So I'm going to pick up a gallon of 2% milk! (unless people suggest another type of milk)

**Produce**

* 5lbs of yellow potatoes - they were on sale.  but after bringing them home
* [These steamer veggies](http://imgur.com/IHh2m) - ""Shoepeg White Corn &amp; Butter Sauce""
* 3lb bag of yellow onions
* 2lb bag of carrots
* A bunch of mushrooms that I froze a few months ago (maybe 4-5lbs?)
* [A bunch of canned tomatoes](http://imgur.com/HbDQ9) - 2 petite diced
* Fresh Ginger

**Meat**

* ~.5lb Ball tip steak
* 4 big country style ribs
* A whole chicken (4.69lbs)
* 4lbs top round steak
* [5 cans of spam](http://imgur.com/UJqd1) - 1 original, 1 turkey
* 4 pouches (2.6oz each) of tuna
* Oxtail

**Baking stuff**
not sure the exact amount I have of each

* White flour
* Brown sugar
* Truvia
* Honey
* Coconut flakes
* [Some asian flours](http://imgur.com/fCEyR) - one used to make har kow
* Baking soda
* 3 packets of unflavored gelatin
* ""Best Blend"" Oil (canola and vegetable oil combined)
* [Asian pudding mixes](http://imgur.com/u0pOV) - one ""purin"" and one ""black sesame""

I also have some [beer](http://boabeerblog.com/2012/02/16/leinenkugels-winter-sampler-pack/).

I am a barista, I'm up for it!

Some things I was planning on making for the weekend already:

* Pho (using the spices and some of the beef, rice noodles)
* Taiwanese beef noodle soup (Using spices, and soba noodles) - from the two soups, I'll probably have a lot of left over beef broth.  So any recipes using beef broth would be nice too!
* Curry (beef, carrots, onions, potatoes)
* Roasted chicken (going to roast the whole chicken
* Mini sandwiches (croissants
* Omelettes (egg beaters, steak, whatever)
* Honey citron ribs (pork ribs
* Congee (rice

Things I was planning on freezing:
* cooking the pasta then freezing it
* cooking the rice then freezing it
* probably freezing some chicken
and... I'm stuck.  I don't really know what kinds of sauces freeze well.  Also

I have a slow cooker, microwave, blender, coffee pot (i dunno how that will help me cook, but hey some people are creative!) to cook with.  So utilizing any/all would be awesome :D

In the last years I did a radio show at my campus radio with some friends of mine: We asked people to invite us to cook for them in their homes, I'm myself quite experimental at home and from that I've got some not-so-common leftovers in my cupboard. I will be moving to another town at the end of the month. So I'm trying to reduce the food I've to bring into the new flat. 

You can come up with as many suggestions as you want and surpise me with something new. This is more or less a long term task. I'm also able to buy additional stuff (meat


So

- [Goji berries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfberry#Culinary)

- [Kimchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi) (canned and some quite old self made -- not sure if still edible)

- [Gochujang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang) (in fact one of my favourite ingredients I learned of by doing this radio show)

- [fufu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fufu) flour

- palm oil

- green tea soba

- fresh and dry udon

- ~~korean potato starch noodles~~

- dry soy beans

- canned chick peas

- [gram (chick pea) flour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_flour)

- miso

- oyster sauce

- ponzu sauce

- [rayu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_oil) (chinese chili oil)

- tamarind paste

- panko

- tahini

- bulghur

- canned meat (similar to spam

- toor dal (split lentils)

- sunflower seeds

- greek kritharaki pasta (somewhat like larger rice)


And some frozen stuff as well:

- Lotus roots

- Okra

- Fresh green soy beans

- Bitter melon (this will be a challenge for you! Didn't like them at all)

- Gyoza skins

- ~~250 g ground lamb~~
