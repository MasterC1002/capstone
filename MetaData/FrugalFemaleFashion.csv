1331819522.0,qxret,Let's Talk About Frugality,higgyskiggy,36,5,21,"F cubed, I would like for all of us to really define *frugality*. I think that really developing what is frugal for you individually and sticking to it benefits not only your wardrobe but all that you buy. **Here are some of my own personal guidelines to start the discussion:**

* **Frugal vs. Cheap**. Scenario: you find a pair of jeans for $12. However, and are much heavier weight. Which do you choose? You could get two pairs of the first jeans for the price of one pair of the second. This may seem frugal at first, because you are getting double the product for the same price. But long term, this is a financially poor choice. The lower quality jeans will probably only last two or three seasons. The better quality can last you 5+ years. Once you start thinking of your clothing as investments it's much easier to buy less clothing, knowing that each item will have a longer lifetime. 
* **Determining the Quality of what you Buy** Now that you have decided to buy less and longer term, I would buy a pair of genuine leather pumps online for up to $55, but I would never buy PVC or synthetic online. In my experience, cotton, cotton blends, leather, silk, modal and and rayon are quality fabrics that generally have the same integrity from store to store. Polyester and PVC are big no-no's in my book, I will all materials a chance in store because I can physically evaluate each item. To get started, avoid it like the plague.
* **Trendy vs. Classic** I understand that not everyone dresses like Calvin Klein. But there are some basic items that *every* woman has/needs in her wardrobe. Examples: dress shoes, outerwear, and one solid bag. I don't care if you dress like Anna Wintour or Kristen Stewart, you are going to need a coat, some shoes appropriate for an interview, and a place to keep all your crap in (even if it's just your keys, phone and wallet). Just because they are ""classic"" pieces doesn't mean it can't be your style. Because these items are something you want to last a good few years (I mean, please consider your budget. Now double it for these particular items. I'm not saying you HAVE to spend $100 on a pair of shoes, and then not needing to buy another for the next 7 years. On the flip side
* On a **final note**, and I dress better, look better, and year to year spend *less* on clothing. I understand some of you are on super tight budgets. So get what you need now, and take baby steps. Maybe it will take you four months to save up for that trench coat or leather pumps. So be it. There  is no shame in taking your time building your wardrobe. You will make better decisions on what you need to buy and most likely score better deals when you really take the time and effort to spend and splurge. **We can ALL own a $400 purse. Frugal ladies are just smarter and can find it for $60 ;)**",,False,t5_2tnuv,True

I really like the dresses they have on modcloth except I cannot and wouldn't pay the outrageous amount. I really like wearing dresses but I can only wear the ones that hide my problem areas well. So I am looking for knee length summer dresses with sleeves and not too snug on the body. To give a general idea
  
Most of the dresses out there are too short (for my liking) and if I find the right length, up to $30-40 is the max I would want to spend on a dress. Thanks a lot in advance.",,False,,t5_2tnuv,False,,

Has anyone had experience with this? Any advice on clothing dyes? Can I do this in a pail

2.I also have a powder blue mid-calf length coat similar to [this](http://www.wellheeledblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jcrewladyday.jpg) that I fetched out of the free  bin outside a vintage shop. It has what looks like rust stains dotting the sleeves and as much as I LOVE the light colour I think I will need to dye it dark to make it wearable. It is really well made and has a cream lining. Can I do this myself or is this a job for a professional? I don't mind paying to make it look good since I got it for free.

We've knocked out her suits for presentation days (two conferences back to back) and semi-formal conservative wear for the days she's not personally giving talks but will still be around

We're looking for 1-2 dresses that wouldn't be wildly inappropriate to wear around academic luminaries in your field but are still feminine and sexy enough to fit in with the younger crowds and look her best in.

She stands 5'9"" and weighs 125-130 (conference stress could leave her anywhere between those two). Her measurements are 34C/26.5/37.5 with somewhat broad shoulders and particularly long legs (inseam length when accounting for heels is nearly 34""). She'll be in the American midwest

She generally shies away from loosely fitted peasant tops, bodycon cuts, and ""funky elements"" (a bright color or unusual cut). She also loves interesting patterns (there were some almost Day-of-the-Dead-esque items she eyed a lot this summer) and cute touches (like bows and ""sailor-esque"" collars).

She tends to wear a lot of black and red already, but then again, I understand that she can't be too absurdly bold in front of some of the older professors.

In terms of outfit-completers

* Several cardigans and low-cut sweaters that could be worn over a dress (black, maybe a couple other colors)

* Black leather calf-high boots with buckles

* Three pairs of 3-4"" heels (brown suede pumps with a wrap-over strap over the foot with a small button; dark purple suede pumps

* Several pairs of black flats

* Various colors of tights and leggings--blacks and dark browns in tights, and black in leggings (plus funkier colors like yellow). She also has fishnets in black and teal

* A small selection of belts including a wide black belt with chrome hoop-style buckle

 I have about $100 and am ready to purchase a few new quality tops.  I just need to know what stores and brands would be best.  I'd of course like them to be fashionable and make me look sophisticated (I'm 28 and don't mind looking the part).

I also love the ease of dresses, but I have no time to iron them.  The best dress I have for nursing is actually a maternity dress from Target that still looks good on me post-baby.  It has an overlapping v-neck that's easy to pull aside.  I wear it probably too much.

I'm willing to go to thrift stores

I'm 21 and the majority of clothes that I have are from high school, or falls apart in a couple of wearings. I have very little left in my closet that is actually wearable.

I have a couple good pairs of jeans, two sundresses, two good cardigans and a couple lightweight scarfs I like. The rest is cheap and low-quality, and several years old. 

I would **love** some recommendations of places to shop

I'm 21, 5'7"", 120 pounds with very fair skin. Clothes are always too short in the sleeves, legs and torso for me. Dresses are the worst. Modcloth has cute stuff but it's all pretty short, and the dresses are the worst of it. Last I checked a dress was meant to cover your butt! I also run in to problems like clothing being too baggy or only available in unflattering neons. (Seriously wtf is with this trend recently?)
