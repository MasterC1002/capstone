Hey guys

...Well

I'm sorry if this is a very noob post

 * What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation

- This will be Gaming, and I will be doing a lot of web based ones.  I currently render usin' Sony Vegas Movie Studio 11.

 * What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

- I've got about $2
 
 * When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

- ASAP

 * What, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

- Tower and all inside it, keyboard, mouse, decent mic.  Also need an OS.

 * Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US

- US

 * If reusing any parts

- very little.  Old computer will remain family used.  Will have 2 extra monitors (can't get access to info atm

 * Will you be overclocking? If yes

- I don't intend to overclock right away

 * If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

- Wifi access

 * Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

- I probably do, looks like a guy squinting while raspberryin' ya).

 * Extra info or specifics:  

- When buying a rabbit

Basically my friend (girl) loves to play video games, sometimes we would like to play a game together but are unable to because her laptop cant handle anything. 

As we are both college students

**Example Games** ---- **Graphic quality** (around 35 frames on med. would be nice

Guild Wars 2 ------------- Low - Med

Counter Strike: GO ------- Low - Med

Portal 2 ----------------- Low - Med

Left 4 Dead ------------- Low - Med

**Needed Parts** (The stuff I dont have)

* Case (probably looking at a mid/small tower? I could be wrong?)
* PSU
* Motherboard
* Processor
* Graphics Card 
* Ram
* HDD (at least 100gb ""I can upgrade it later"")

*I don't care about brand so long as they work together

There is my comparisson of their ""high end"" and low end Alienware builds and the very very clear proof that they are in no way a good idea to purchase and in fact are just ripping you off. Custom PC building is easy and while it may require a little bit of your time will save you headaches and money in the long run. Not to mention if your truly terrified of building it yourself NCIX has a $50 building fee as do many other pc shops and even including that fee the custom route is still a far better one to go.

All I have for a monitor is a Vizio HDTV 47"". Prefer a new monitor.

I don't know what that is but I would probably find a way to do it if it's going to make it better.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

1369500083.0,1f1abq,[Mod Post] Welcome to all of our new subscribers!,karmapopsicle,34,1,5,"Well

But with subreddit growth comes subreddit growing pains. Increasingly we're seeing many build requests failing to follow the request guidelines

Due to the increased load

These measures have always been an attempt to keep the quality of this subreddit as high as can be. The first real rule we had was for contributors to *not make assumptions*, quality drops back to where it was a year ago.

Even with all of the questions though, when you do post a build, don't just post the markup and leave. Add in some explanations or justifications for what you've put in the build. This ends up being both informative to the OP, as well as anyone coming along looking to critique it. [As an example of what I mean by explaining stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1cp1uq/1100_high_ram_gaming_casual_pc/c9ix3e8).

To combat this we are again going to re-design the sidebar in order to put the rules front and center

The problem here is that many new contributors are failing to first read through the sidebar, and as such, are posting builds left right and centre that don't meet either the posters or the subreddit's requirements, and simply clutter up request pages.

As such

The application process will be relatively simple.

Send us a message indicating that you would like Approved Contributor status. In this post

*Hello


*I, and will request more info from the OP when insufficient info has been provided. I will not make assumptions about needed parts. I will not assume a builder is looking for an overclocking rig. [etc, etc]*


*Signed

After receiving this, to a media machine. Once we receive your reply(s), we will decide whether to grant you Approved Contributor status, and may offer up some constructive criticism.
**************************
Alright

Up for grabs is a Steam game $15 or less of your choice, interesting (and well justified) part choices, etc.

The challenge is as follows:

* Purpose of the build: Pure gaming machine.

* The country the parts will be purchased in: US - not near a Microcenter.

* Budget: $2000 maximum before rebates.

* What you need included in your budget: Everything. Tower, mouse.

* Whether you would prefer a stock build or an overclocking build: Overclocking build.

* Extra info: Please offer up a short explanation for your part choices.

This contest will run for 24 hours from the time of this post.

Have fun and a massive thank you to all of you!

1348518845.0,10esat,Not impressed with Cookie Cutter builds.  Can we discuss this subs purpose?,HelpYouBuildAPC,36,7,14,"r/buildapcforme is consistently getting referred to in r/buildapc.  I for one think that adding a step for people that are not informed

I purpose a generic copy and paste system for 11 builds.  Two vanilla builds for surfing, and tweaks need to be made to the actual build sections.

We should Iron out the details, Bit-tech, Guru3d and other sites on a daily basis......we then update when anything significant happens.

The builds in the side bar are cookie cutter builds.  I think its great that people are wanting to help out.  But throwing up a price point with generic parts that have very little if any upgrade path is not what this sub should be about.  

   **The Problem**

We want people to not just Build a PC once, but this is just bad.

.

--------------------------

.


**2 Generic Builds** (Best for parents
$300 and $500

**2 HTPC Builds** (Best for space saving layout with low noise parts.  We might want to include recommended Software (XBMC) or recommended Tuner cards) $400-$500

**3 Productivity Builds**  (Best for Photoshop, or other heavy uses.  These should all include a recommendation on a monitor.)
$600-$900-$1200

**4 Gaming Builds** (Obviously for gaming.  Best way to break this down is desired gaming potential. ) 

$400  (Medium settings at 720p for modern games.......maybe.  Indie game build).

$600 (Portal, Modern games on Medium/High settings at 1680x1050).

$800 (Modern Games on High settings at 1920x1080).

$1100 (Max Modern games with minimum frame rates of 30FPS and Average frame rates in 50-60).


--------------------


Given that we can assume that everyone coming here will have no real knowledge of building a PC I think 3 things should be kept in mind for EVERY build.  


* Every build should include a high quality or easy to use case.  

* Every build EXCEPT the most expensive should avoid overclocking.  

* Every build should consider upgrade potential.

Obviously the case is the best investment.  It can be used for years, sharp edges, and general shoddiness of the end result.

Overclocking should only be on the most expensive builds such as the 900 and 1200 Productivity build and the 1100 Gaming build.  Assuming that most users posting in here are completely new to building a pc

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

I honestly am not sure what overclocking is or how to do it. :/ I've heard it's useful though for high intensity graphics.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

Front and rear USB at the least for me is needed. I can't think of much else at the moment though that could be useful on the case.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

This post is specifically for build suggestions

Hey guys

We've been discussing the cookie cutter builds a lot recently, or maybe more of them, just post in the first thread that I linked on what you think they should be. So, here are the categories:

Basic builds:

* $250
* $350
* $450

Non-overclocking gaming builds:

* $400
* $500
* $600
* $700
* $800
* $900
* $1000
* $1100
* $1200

Overclocking gaming builds:

* $600
* $700
* $800
* $900
* $1000
* $1100
* $1200

Media/creative + gaming builds:

* $500
* $600
* $700
* $800
* $900
* $1000
* $1100
* $1200

If your budget is above this price point, as those are not needed at these price ranges, and if you have a lot of monitors and want a gaming build made for gaming across all those monitors, then you should be making a post anyway, as those are pretty special builds, most people are not going to be doing that.

I just wanted to say that because I am not a common visitor of this sub-reddit. Today I have skimmed through probably around 10 build requests and the vast majority of the CPU's chosen in these requests happened to be either the i5 3570k or the haswell i5 4670k. And when it wasn't them too it was their locked counterpart. There were a few AMD CPU's mentioned like the Athlon II or the fx-6300 but they were for the budget end builds. Sadly I think people completely rule out the FX-8350. I'm not saying the Intel CPU's above are bad but I think the 8350 deserves some more recognition in the 700-1000$ price range. Also Tek Syndicate made a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8Sekdb-IE) showing how if streaming is in your interest then the AMD CPU outshines the 4-core processors by Intel. Also the FX-8350 is at a lower price point so that is something to keep in mind as well. I admit the Intel CPU's tend to do better as far as gaming is concerned and the Intel CPU's are still great for streaming but I just wished that people would consider the AMD card more often!

I'm hoping to keep my initial build price around $500 Canadian/American(I'm close enough to the border) and I'm planning to build around upgrade ability. I have about a dozen games I simply cannot play(arkham Asylum, Far Cry 3 and Steam summer sale). I would like to start with a machine good enough to play these and build towards med-high settings for future games over the next 3 years and replace around 5. I would like 1080 but can easily step down. I have a monitor, tv and other accessories.


My plan at the moment is to build the PC into the bottom drawer of an old wooden desk I have. It's a fairly classic piece handmade in the 20's so I want to preserve it as much as possible and aim to have as clear a desktop as possible. One drawer needs the bottom panel remade so I will be working from that to build standoffs and run cable management as I see fit.


Questions -
Will this be ESD safe with the drawer being opened and closed?


Is it worth building low end haswell now and upgrading later? From my reading this seems no.


I have the chance to get an i7 2700k for about 200$ from a friend
A board with Thunderbolt would be a huge plus(I will still have tons of apple stuff) but is nowhere near necessary.

I have no particular allegiance to Intel over AMD but do not know AMD's lineup at all. 


That needs a TL;DR

$500CAD

No case or display needed

Mainly shooter games and media.

Can sacrifice 1080

Needs to be upgradeable

Is i7 2700k worth 200$ CAD?

Thunderbolt optional.

A.S.A.P

Already have a monitor, and storage HDD (500 gigs). Would like to have a SSD (around 250 gigs preferably but open to suggestions). We need a Mobo, good graphics card, CPU, power supply, case, ram (8 gigs I'm thinking), and case fans given the case doesn't come with any. Also Win 7.

The U.S. and not near Microcenter unfortunately :(

&gt;If reusing any parts

It's a Samsung monitor

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

No overclocking on the CPU or GPU.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

An SSD with decent storage space (I've had good experiences with the latest Samsung pro series but you guys let me know what you think please). USB 3 (front or back) would be nice but not mandatory. Won't be raid or anything. A case with good cable management features would be handy but I can manage otherwise if it's too over budget for one.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

She wants a ""nice"" case. What ever that means. I assume something clean looking with a clear window looking into it. I'll add LEDs at some point should she decide that's ""nice"" but not needed for the initial build. Low noise is not a huge concern but would prefer something that doesn't sound like a jet engine in our office.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

We'd need a new OS. Win 7 preferred. I'm thinking basic home edition but not sure of the benefits of other editions.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

Nothing really to much. Just to recap we already have a monitor, storage HDD, and headset. Would like a good SSD.

There will be some incoming CSS changes soon that will help direct people, but for now, it's up to you guys.

2) Quality over quantity!
--
In the past few months there have simply been too many cases of users showing up out of the blue, choose out of stock or just poor parts, and generally just carelessly thrown together, sloppy builds. Take your time. There's no point posting a dozen bad builds that just clutters up and confuses build requesters. Focus on making each build you put together as good as you possibly can make it. 

3) Don't post builds for uses/budgets you're unfamiliar with.
--
Every time someone requests a $2500+ build you'll find maybe one or two builds from people who know what they're doing, etc. Stick to helping people with what you know. If you don't know, lurk the thread and/or spend an hour researching what you need to know. May sound like a lot, but that research doesn't just go away when you're done with that build. Then next time you come across a similar request, you've already got a head-start.

------------------------------------------------------------

New process for becoming an Approved Contributor.
--
The Approved Contributor process is being streamlined in order to make it easier on everyone.

To apply for Approved Contributor flair

* A pledge to follow the rules and guidelines

* A short bit about what kind of builds you've got knowledge and experience with

* A build of your choice that you think best showcases the knowledge you've got. Anything from a cheap HTPC to a multi-thousand-dollar multi-media workstation and anything in between. Include the relevant build request info that would warrant a rig like this

Thanks for ready anyone and everyone

MODS: If you for whatever reason find this post acceptable, or is just unnecessary in your eyes, take it down. I'm sorry I bothered you, MODS.

Finally; Rules/Requirements.

* Good quality parts. Not some $20 MOBO that has nothing but 1 egg reviews on newegg. I have got one of those in a build request I have posted here
* As long as the parts are good make the build as cheap as possible
* This build should be able to at least play games at 30 FPS on medium settings on all games at 1080p. Even Crysis 3 on its lowest settings. This will be an all around gaming computer. Don't forget about those CPU intensive games as well! (Even play some games on High or Max hopefully!)
* 8 gigs of ram with a CAS latency of at least 11 or lower. (Preferred CAS of 9 or lower though.)
* Ram will be DDR3 Memory clocked with a MINIMUM of at least 1600mhz. No DDR3 1333 RAM sticks.
* 500 Gigs of storage
* No peripherals
* Lastly. EXPLAIN why you chose what you did. This is your chance to show off your knowledge and show why you're smarter than everyone. You're welcomed to challenge other posters on here as well! This is a learning experience! If you see something in a build you'd choose differently

I think if this catches on

Hell

Anyways

Edit: The reason why I chose cheap is simple just in case you don't know why I did. It is easy to make a high priced gaming computer with lots of high quality parts,False,self,t5_2tjcr,1363887471.0,,,t3_1apxay

I/It need(s):

*At least four cores in the CPU (I run multiple things at once

*All the Peripherals - Keyboard

*To run games at at-least medium settings

*At least 8 gigs of memory.

*A CD drive that's able to write songs to a CD to put in a car.

*A OS. Unless I can find myself a good way to get one for free. *Hint hint

I understand I have a very tight and hard budget for everything I'd like to have. So everything following this is optional.

I'd like to have (I'm listing these in order of things I'd appreciate most to things I'd like to have least):

*A Graphics card that can support 2 monitors (but I'd be extremely grateful if it can support 3 monitors [I do know this is unrealistic for my budget

*A well sized HDD that'll hold plenty of games until I can upgrade. The reason why this is in wants is because somewhere in my house I have a computer that I might be able to salvage the HDD from.

*A windowed case!! I always was attracted to windowed cases. Not sexually of course. But air ventilation is still a wire priority

*THE MORE EXPANSION SLOTS THE BETTER

*The more future proof the better.

*A case that has nice wire management.

*A modular PSU.

*Be able to record gameplay and audio from a Mic I might be using in the future. 

*A SSD used mainly (and probably only) used for the OS and drivers I have.

*Onboard WIFI

*Onboard Blu-tooth (is there even such thing?)

*The PC case to be as small as possible while keeping good air ventilation.

*The more drive bays to go with that small PC the better.

*DDR3-1600 memory or above

*I'm an AMD fanboy, between Intel and AMD is? A computer is a computer and if it does what you want to do, then you should appreciate it.

*A aftermarket CPU fan for OC. this is at the bottom of my list because I don't care much for it

I do understand some of that stuff is unreasonable for my price range. I understand I wont get some of that stuff either. Some of that was silly of me to ask, building a PC that can Play games, program, and surf the web. The other stuff is just luxury.

I have nearly unlimited funds (into 10's of thousands)

Hoping to purchase the parts off of newegg (as I said, so if you can give me a list of items that can be found on there, all the better! I'm absolutely opposed to not ordering online.


Here's what I'm looking for (beyond standard reliability):

* At least 2 physical CPU's; each of them, I'll listen. I've talked to some friends, the overall consensus seems to be Xeon.
* I'm thoroughly convinced more RAM = better. Cas latency minimized.
* Motherboard that can handle as many RAM sticks as possible (right?)
* There shouldn't be much of an issue with dedicated power (if you can justify multiple PSU's
* Disk drive (DVD reader writer
* For the hard drive
* Extra hard drives

No worries about anything other than the tower.

It'll be running the newest version of Ubuntu server (14.04?)

1360264382.0,182wl1,3000$ build for great justice!,Gravity_crush,20,7,39,"Hi guys! I'm here to get your opinions on a gaming/streaming build. First I thought a little background was in order.  I'm 29 years old and just a year ago my life was in shambles.  I tried committing suicide and spent a month in a mental hospital.  After which I found myself homeless and with no direction in life.  ""What the fuck does any of this have to do with a gaming pc"" you are probably asking yourself right now.

  Well it's simple really this pc is a kind of a manifestation of how I've turned my life around for the better and how I've bounced back from adversity and beaten depression.  It may seem silly that a pc could mean that to anyone but that's what it means to me.

Now on to the tech stuff.

What I want: A kick ass gaming/streaming pc.  Something I can play a game at near 60fps on high to ultra quality and export a beautiful quality stream to twitch.  Also the ability to record gaming footage without significant performance hit to the game im playing for later editing. Render times never really bothered me all that much.  I usually use one 23"" monitor with a junk monitor on the side to watch stream chat or a movie or see what song is comming up next on my playlist.

What I already have: I'll be reusing my current keyboard, optical drive, and headset.

Budget: About 3k while I don't mind spending that much and I do like that ""holy shit"" factor I still understand that some shit is just too much money for very little to no return in performance.  Also I live in the u.s on the eastern seaboard in driving distance to a micro center and I've used newegg before.

I'd like to thank you all in advance for the help and hope you all have a awesome day


Edit* windows 8.... Take the plunge or no? Can't seem to get a straight answer on this.

Edit numero dos* Once i decide on which build i like the most or which build i use the most input from im going to give that person a month of reddit gold as a thank you.  I wish i could give it to everyone who submitted a build as it's all very appreciated.  Also once i purchase the parts and receive everything i'm going to make sure to take pictures and video and document making it.  Not just as a hey look at this awesome thing i built but as a thank you to all of you.  Once it's all said and done ill be posting the pictures and video here again.

1358149668.0,16ji6m,"First time gaming build. Don't know what overclocking is, don't have monitor, no OS, I just have a bunch of Steam games I can't run and plenty of money.",CapnMatt,4, but I've put video cards and RAM into whatever family computer I had to play games. Now I have the money to make my own system

I basically took a bunch of cookie cutters and builders, because it was $100 cheaper. Would the extra performance really be worth that much? I also don't think I would need more than a single HDD, as I have an external already for storing media. Should I spring for a SSD in that case or just a 7200RPM HDD? I also understand that the i5 is pretty much the CPU I need for gaming, but are there different models? I hear I need an IvyBridge i5, is that different than the 3350 in my build?

The cookie cutter setup had a Micro ATX motherboard, or Mid sizes? I rather prefer unnecessary lights. I put the Thermaltake case onto this build but it is sort of pricey. Would that one be loud? I was told a BitFenix Shinobi was the quiet option, but it didn't appear to have any kind of fans or openings or anything like that.

I need a monitor, nothing too big. I would say a 23""? Is that about normal? I don't know the size of the laptop I'm using right now. I also need a mouse and keyboard but I'm not picky about that unless someone has an outstanding recommendation

If I don't know about overclocking

Also, but do they seriously not need dedicated coolers when they're not? Naturally I'll believe it if that's the case, but I feel like they'd still get pretty hot even when not overclocked. I guess it wouldn't surprise me if CPUs are designed to stay cool unless you overclock them, but I'm paranoid.

Hi All

I've looked through the (extensive) material here and it seems I might have a bit of an unusual and fun request.

I'm looking to build a research/gaming computer. I've been getting by with research on a MacBook Pro (Apple products are used more frequently in my field) and gaming on consoles

What do I need for research? I run replicated simulations (e.g., 100,000's or 1,000,000's of data points) and need the ability to process this data efficiently. I don't need a massive hard drive, but I'm sitting at 400gb of data currently and could see the benefit of giving myself some breathing room. Other ""demanding"" programs I use frequently:  Photoshop, Illustrator, and IE (I kid

Other interests:  I'd love to transition from a beefy laptop to something a little more sleek because I travel frequently. Thus, backups, setting up simulation runs or doing large calculations).

What do I need for gaming? I really would love to appreciate the aesthetics of my games because I've paid my dues (e.g., based on my research needs, I may not need a whole lot more to build a decent gaming rig.

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!


&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation

Please see above

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I'd like to keep the budget under $4,000? Great, thanks! Do you have a compelling argument for why I should build a $4,000 PC? Are you just wishing I had said the budget was $6,000 because I'd be missing out on something critical? I'll hear you out. 

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

I'm ready to start buying components whenever. I'll start building in mid-August (or later if you can make a compelling argument for waiting for new components) and figured I'd give some lead time so that I could keep an eye out for good prices.

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

* Valve's Steambox is most definitely on my radar so I probably wait for more details regarding that before making a decision. Really

* I would be building from scratch and would need any and everything, I would need a keyboard and mouse set - nothing too crazy, just something that works. Wired or wireless doesn't matter, whichever you think is best. Out of personal preference, particularly raised keys would be best avoided (due to years of using an Apple-made keyboard) and a minimum of two side-buttons on the mouse would be appreciated. I also have a 500GB Seagate external HDD, if that means anything.

* Not reusing any parts. I have an Acer 19"" 1920x108 LED display with one HDMI port and no internal speakers. 

* I have only a basic understanding of overclocking and have no desire to try at this time.

* As far as the case goes, low-priced two-button mouse.

I am looking to build a PC that will be running dual monitor setup and will be used for playing music on one screen and showcad artist (lighting) on the other one.
What I am looking for is a processor that can do both of those things without any problems. I have herd that AMD is better at multitasking
Is there an option to run both screens without dedicated graphics card?
And I will need LOADS of storage
The one I was looking at in a shop was around 377£. But it had only 1TB storage and I did not like a couple of other parts
I tried r/buildapc but got directed here. 
What say you? Can you help me out?

EDIT 1.
Hey. Sorry for disappearing
It will be a workstation. The only programs that will be used are PC DJ (a simple audio soft for playback and mixing) and a showcad artist (http://www.showcad.com/products.aspx)
My budget is 500 or under.
I want to buy it as soon as possible.
For the money I would like to get the tower and the OS.
Parts will be purchased in UK.
I am sorry I was not clear enough. Basically what we have right now is a tower that runs PC DJ trough a mixer (maybe someone knows if a soundcard would improve the quality). We have monitor as well. I think it is a 19`, and we would like to move to digital. No we dont have DMX controller but again, if i can get a decent tower for reasonable price we will be getting one.

[Full imgur album of the results](http://imgur.com/a/JU5rJ).

Conclusion we can draw:

* The majority of users are occasional contributors who arrived within the past 3 months. This makes sense when compared to the subreddit statistics.

* It appears that most users haven't felt the need to apply for Flair

* Build request posts are generally still about the same quality they were before

* The rules for Build Requests appear to have pretty widespread approval

* Generally the moderation levels is about right

* The vast majority of users believe the rules for contributors are A-OK

* On the moderation style

* A small segment of users would prefer the subreddit move into a *laissez-faire* style hands-off approach

* Many users want some kind of cookie cutter/build guide to be available again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So what kind of changes will we see from this?

* A few changes to the sidebar style and text. Boxes will be more delineated in colour

* I'm looking into some potential CSS changes in the stylesheet to hopefully enable use to have the build request questions default to a template in the submit post page. (Side note

* We're going to start relying more on *you* the subscribers and contributors on the ground level to help enforce the rules! When you see someone posting a build over budget, etc, *report* it, and *reply* pointing out those things.

* Builds with dangerous, usually with a reply at least stating the reason(s).

* Builds that either break rules, comments, or justification will be left up, and the violations will be pointed out.

* Repeat rule breakers will be given a few warnings

* We will look into starting the wiki, all in one. We may reach out to some users to help manage this at some point, given we can now give partial moderator access to a bunch of things.

* We may reach out to a couple users in different timezones specifically for post moderation and rule enforcement.

* We may look into some way of making becoming an Approved Contributor more appealing

1348546958.0,10fmia,New Cookie Cutter Builds -2 Generic Build Discussion,HelpYouBuildAPC,11,0,3,"Here are the 2 new generic builds I am suggesting.  Instead of a list of 12 random price points I think we should have sections and prices.  The sections I listed in the other thread but I will repeat them here real quick.

Also at the bottom will be a generic peripherals chart.  No sections for this as it will be a buy what you desire kind of thing.  Monitors, Speakers, etc.

**2 Generic Builds** - Mom/Pop machines for easy use on the cheap.  Perfect for Skype/Youtube/Farmville/Netflix  $350 - $500

**2 HTPC builds** - For HTPC use.  I will not be doing these so I encourage one of our other subscribers to get us 2 builds at 2 good price points.

**3 Productivity Builds** For Photoshop, AutoCAD, MAYA use.  $600 $900 $1200

**4 Gaming Builds** Obviously for gaming.  $400 $600 $800 $1200.

Here is the Generic Build at $350.

No promo prices included so pricing should stay accurate for a while.  SSD and Case are the only things that may be purchased with a better discount.

**CPU** - G630 is the cheapest ""good"" processor currently out.  A cheaper Celeron will only save you $10 and sacrifice quite a bit of performance.

**Motherboard**  This B75 mobo can support an i3/i5/i7 for future upgrades

**RAM**  2 Sticks of DDR3-1333 for Dual channel support.  4GB total.  No upgrade options due to 2 slot limitation

**SSD** Why SSD instead of a HD.  Well you can get a 320GB 7200RPM drive for a bit cheaper, you can easily grab an external USB 3.0 HD and save your families memories.  Also with an SSD applying window's constant updates isn't a hassle.  The computer will install and reboot in 2 minutes, which means that keeping your computer up to date and safe is no longer a hassle (10 minute process). 70GB is plenty of room for most people's music collections and a few videos.

**Case** NZXT Source 210 Elite.  Has USB 3.0 port on front and thumb screws for easy installation.  It is also roomy enough and well built enough to keep around for a few more builds down the road.  Also has 2 fans

**PSU**  The Weakest choice here.  There are constantly 80 plus and 80 bronze certified 500 watt PSUs on sale for under $50.  Finding one without a discount is hard.  I would prefer something with 2 6pin cables instead of 1.  However this is a great unit and can support up to a 7770 later on.

Light gaming and web browsing. Most recently we're planning on playing Dota 2 and Dead Space 3 together

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Our budget right now is around $700 but it's slightly flexible. We can always upgrade later.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

Within the next few days

&gt;What

I have my old GTX 560 ti laying around and was planning on using that at the moment, monitor, mouse and keyboard. A decent headset too would be nice, 'cause right now she only has those ipod headphones with the horrible mic that picks up everything in the house, making it impossible to hear her.

For the monitor I'd prefer at least a 23 inch 1080p though I know they might not fit in the budget, as she's used to it.

She's also only 5 feet tall and not very strong

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

We will be purchasing them in Canada. I don't think I've ever even seen a Microcenter here or if they're even in Canada so I'd like to keep that out of the build.

&gt;If reusing any parts

I will be reusing my old EVGA gtx 560 ti.

&gt;Will you be overclocking?

I'd rather not. I've never done it myself before and she would definitely not be able to do it. I'd feel more comfortable not overclocking, I'm not able to visit very much currently and wouldn't be able to fix or adjust anything.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

There is nothing I can think of that I haven't already mentioned.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

Nope. Preferably would like the build to include Windows 7 or 8,False,self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,t3_1kemwh

Some special things I want is a **blu-ray reader**

**&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

I do have a preference for low-noise components - I want to make the computer as quiet as possible - and therefore I would prefer to have a nice looking sound-proof case without unnessecary LEDs or windows. I must also be able to put a watercooling system in the case.

I don't think so.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

No real preferences for features of case (although the quieter the better I guess), and with good reviews, I was looking at this one: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0091C7S4Y/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=

As the title hints, considering I have a fairly good graphics card already, and I would also like this to last as long as possible, I am open to the idea of shedding out a bit more than I HAVE to considering what I want to use it for, so that I don't bottleneck the graphics card and so that I get decent parts which may last a bit longer.

The money I've been allocated needs to cover everything computer related so a monitor will be needed (preferably a 19in ELO touch screen monitor) for ease of use (and compatibility with rivendell) for the students using the playout system although the touchscreen element  is not completely necessary. I would ideally need a motherboard that could support dual monitors (as a side note

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

My absolute maximum is $800

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

I will be building this computer as soon as I reach a consensus on what parts I should buy.  Hopefully in one week from now.

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

For peripherals

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US

Canada (Alberta)

&gt;If reusing any parts

The only thing I don’t need is a mouse.  I have an old 160GB HDD that I could use for storage if that's of any use but other than that I am not reusing any other parts.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

I don’t think I will ever be overclocking.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

I would like a couple of front panel USB ports for ease of access under my desk.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

No preferences here.  If anything

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

No


Thank you very much for reading and considering this build.  I really appreciate your time.

Gaming.

 •&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Roughly $1

 •&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

One month

 •&gt;What

Monitor, internal components

 •&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? 

The U.S. There is a Microcenter close by. I plan on going there and purchasing my mobo &amp; CPU as well as other parts that they have which are a better deal compared to other retailers.

 •&gt;If reusing any parts

Absolutely nothing.

 •&gt;Will you be overclocking? 

Not at the moment. I do want an unlocked CPU for down the road. So there won't be an immediate need for an aftermarket CPU cooler.

 •&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig

Nothing too specific. I really admire the new NZXT H230 case however

 •&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

^Same as above. Just what ever is reasonable.

 •&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

I can get my OS through my university. So theres $100 saved.

1364944759.0,1bjsyb,"[Build Request] [UK] ~£1300 Multi-monitor Gaming, Games server hosting, Films, Dev, General web",12,"Hey!

I am looking to build a multi-monitor Gaming / Film / Development PC with a flexible budget of around £1300 (could go to perhaps £1700 or above if really needed


Some of the requirements for the build:

* I host a small to medium sized [24/7 Bukkit (Minecraft) server](http://silverserver.weebly.com/index.html).

* I would like to play games (sometimes on 3 screens) reasonably well (no need to record the screens). The more intensive games will be ARMA 2, ARMA 3 and maybe BF4 when (or if) they're released also.
* I'll be watching (and storing) a lot of films.
* I'll be programming using Netbeans and perhaps other IDEs.
* Windows 7
* Perhaps a dual boot with Linux (I've not tried dual booting before
* 3TB storage (+ SDD perhaps?)
* I would prefer a case that's simple (I especially dislike the LEDs some have
* 2 USB ports would be nice but not essential.
* No need for any optical drives.

Not that all of these things will be running at once normally

My speakers are fine. The keyboard and mouse are OK but can be replaced if there's any money left. The only things I really need are the box

I'm also looking for recommendations on a desk and computer chair. These could be included or outside the budget.

Thank you! I'll be buying the parts once I've got everything sorted. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

Hey guys

* My friend (the one who is helping me build this thing) tells me to inform you of the games that I play so you guys can get an idea of what kind of duress my PC will be put under.

* The games I generally play are: League of Legends, Minecraft, and a handful of Indie games here and there. Apparently it's also important to tell you **I HAVE MANY MODS FOR SKYRIM**, apparently that takes up a lot of memory? (No clue why) Anyways, those are the games.

TL;DR I'm an ignorant goose

Overall if you guys can put together odds and ends to make me a potent gaming PC for around $1200-$1500 I will spread your name around like peanut butter on toast so people now that guys for r/buildapcforme are the some of the best guys on the interwebs!

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I also would prefer that this computer can make it to at least Medium High-High graphics for these games. Not sure if that goes without saying but I thought it's safe to inform you on that front.

**EDIT**:Thank you all for the incredibly fast responses! I will be sending over the selected build for critiquing over at r/buildapc. I truly appreciate what you guys have done for me and in such haste as well!

She's already bought 3 24.1"" displays @ 1920x1200 resolution so I would really like to get the most out of them with a powerful crossfire setup. The dispays do have a display port in addition to DVI and HDMI so doing 3 screen eyefinity shouldn't be a problem. Here's what I have so far

I looked at using Gigabyte 7970s instead of the XFX 7950s and it puts me $100 over budget. Is the performance increase worth the extra $$ or perhaps changing another component to cover it? I was thinking the memory might be overkill and I could get him a cheaper keyboard.

800 before. At most. See --&gt; maximum.

What I have: Monitor, Speakers, Headphones

What I need: Tower, Wifi Adapter, Video Card, all other components you deem necessary as I am quite the novice in building my own computer...and by quite the novice I mean I have no idea what I'm doing.

If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

Need USB port (3.0 preferably), headphone jack for sure.

____

**Purpose:** Looking to build a gaming PC that can run Diablo 3, Portal, maybe Battlefield 3, and Assassin's Creed on.  I'm not too worried about running these games on max settings, but decent graphics settings would be a plus.  I'm still new this building my own PC so I would like to start our fairly simple and upgrade as I learn more/have the money to buy new parts.



**Country:** I live in the US.  There is a Microcenter less than 30 minutes away and I'm more than willing to drive there.  There is an Amazon warehouse close to me also that I can get parts at.  Online retailers like NewEgg are fine

**Budget:** I'm looking to spend about $350-$450.  Anywhere in this price range is acceptable.  The closer the build is to $450 (even a little over is fine) just adds a little wait time until I can save up the money

**What I Need:**

* Keyboard

* Case - plan to spend no more than $55 on one

* PSU

* Motherboard

* Processor

* Graphics Card

* RAM

* HDD - I already have a 250 gig hard drive and a 1 terabyte external I can use


**What I Don't Need:**

* Monitor

* Mouse

* OS - I'm going to get this through university

* Speakers

**Stock or Overclocking:** Right now a stock build is fine.  Being able to overclock in the future without much hassle would be best

It will definitely be used for gaming. From what I've read, keyboard, mouse, and OS), so I know that will skew my final cost quite a bit. Ideally I'd like a large monitor (my current laptop had a 17"" screen, so larger than that would be good), and a decent mouse and keyboard. From what I've seen

It will also be used for some media. I used to use my laptop to watch movies/TV shows in HD using the HDMI port, which is something I find interesting. It may also be used for some video editing and things of that nature down the line, but this isn't a necessity if it would cost a lot more.

One more thing, and I definitely don't need anything like that. 750GB-1 TB should suffice for me. From what I've seen, I probably would want a solid state drive as well. Hopefully someone can give me some more insight on that.

This is my post on /r/buildapc
http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/15qlws/building_a_budget_400_pc_could_use_some_help/




This is what im looking to do:




So im wondering if I could possibly build a gaming PC that can play games on High (like Dark Souls) for a budget of $400.

**What I already have:**

* Monitor

* Mouse and Keyboard

* HDD

* PSU

* DVD Drive

* Windows







Im not sure if the PSU I have would need to be replaced to suit the needs So here is some info.

+12V1@18A

All at 450W

The brand is Coolmax.







**What I need:**

* CPU:

* GPU:

* RAM:

* CASE:

* MOBO:

* PSU (if mine isnt good enough).

$400 would be my spending limit for the missing components. I might be able to go up just a few bucks.

Thank you for the help!

I really like the aesthetic design of the white Bitfenix cases. My problem is that I don't know who makes quality cases or what size I'd need. I assume you can't SLI in a mini ITX build so that case is out of the question unless I am wrong ( I am new to this). Also it doesn't have to be a BitFenix if there are better quality cases you recommend. I'm not a fan of windows and crazy LEDs (the Colossus being the exception ).

•	Display: Minimum resolution of 1200 x 800 most resolutions are way above this.

•	Network: 100mb Ethernet
 
I have been running this program without any issues on an inspiron 1525 laptop with these specks:

CPU: intel 2 duo T5850 @ 2.16GHz
Ram:  2 Gb speed?
OS: Windows 7 Professional 32 bit

And therefore convinced their requirements are overkill but understand why they encourage them. Also whatever we build will be faster and stronger than the server but that needs to wait till next quarter where this laptop is on its last leg. 

Side note this is not my office I am the new chiropractor that is taking over and trying to balance upgrades while still making money to live and pay off student loans. 

•	&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I know this is not ideal but I cannot go over $500 comfortably at this point to stay in the green for the business always a little wiggle room for business because I do not want to build a lemon. 

•	&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

I need to have this figured out by the end of this month. So I might have to get an update in two weeks but plan to deal search with whatever seems to be the best fit you guys build for the office. 

•	&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

I have access to a Monitor, possible psu (was for another build) and video card but was leaning towards APU to bypass that dedicated GPU. I also have an old tower I can use I believe it is a dell workstation that is just an htpc at home that is not being used after the move. 

•	&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US

United States and not near a microcenter but will be traveling for business in two weeks about an hour outside of Philly so a possible option but a long shot. 

•	&gt;If reusing any parts

I have access to a 15 in monitor but not sure of make or model or a 22 in dell also unsure of model. The PSU is a corsair and another PSU to decide between. Sorry for the lack of information but at work filling this out between patients. 

•	&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

Not at all

•	&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

None

•	&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

None, just vents. 

•	&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

I believe I need to find an OS and it must be windows professional either 7 or 8. Could someone send me a few reviews of 8 if they know of some good ones to read/watch. I feel unsure about 8 since I am running 7 on the server pc up front.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

I'm looking to buy and build immediately.

&gt;What do you need included in the budget?

The tower parts and case will be the only things included in the budget. I have a decent ASUS monitor and tv that I will be going back and forth on.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

I will be purchasing in USA. I live about 5 minutes walking distance from this Microcenter: http://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/chicago.aspx

&gt;Will you be reusing any parts?

I'll just be reusing my bluetooth kbam

&gt;Will you be overclocking?

No.

&gt;Any specifics needed?

I do want green LEDs. My current build is blue and I'd like something a little different. So along with that

I would like to use Windows 8.

Thank you so much for your help! I appreciate it so much. :)",self,t5_2tjcr,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1humve/gaming_pc/

Mainly for gaming like Dota 2, Skyrim, CS:GO, a few new AAA titles (also The Division and HL3???). I would hope to play these and some newer games on at least medium settings for about 2 years minimum.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Preferably $500-$1000. I am flexible and will be splitting the bill with my family (upcoming birthday presents). If somebody could price out maybe a lower budget and a higher budget for comparison that'd be awesome!

I will likely be buying the case, and mouse very soon. The rest of the parts may be a bit in the future, but I may get them now if the deals are good.

Down the line...

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

USB 3.0 on the front or some kind of media reader that I could plug in to the computer and leave the box on my desk for easy access. If that can manage sound and headphone jacks would be cool too.

I use Ubuntu and fucking hate Microsoft.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

This is a revisit from my post from a few months back. I deliberated from that time and have decided I would like to keep the power of the previous suggestions with whatever changes you think are good. I don't need a DVD/CD/Bluray player. I also have a Small Business discount with Dell.

I'm reposting with the hope that you can help me out -- with a ***reward!***  The top post gets a cup of coffee!  I'll send a $10 Starbucks gift card to the highest rated post so they can relax with a cup of joe

Rig details below:

-----

After lurking forever

**Used for? :**  Heavy gaming - full frame rate wherever possible.  Plan on playing FP games like Arkham City

Also planning mild video editing -- putting family videos together

Also plan on spawning Virtual machines for programming.

These won't be running concurrently though


**Maximum prefered budget:**  $2000 is fine but willing to go into debt for higher.

**When?:**  Next couple weeks.....who am I kidding

**What do you need:**  Outsides:  24"" monitor, WiFi dongle

Insides:  CPU, Bluray drive, Fan (would like to stay away from liquid), SSD drive for OS, uber-TB drive for games, downloads, stuff. 

**Country:**  US;  I'm 2 hours from a MicroCenter so if it saves &gt;$200

**Reuse:**  Nothing 

**Overclocking:**  Interested but not doing it for a long long time

**Features:**  Front USB would be nice;  no RAID;  

**OS License:**  No

**Extra info:**  Back when everyone just pointed you to Incremental Build
seemed like it would run all current games at highest-max-values and framerate possible
Biggest Rig on the Block.

Looking at the site now
I would like to run these games at 5 but not have a huge mongo-machine.  I don't need bragging rights -- I just
don't want to see video stutter or pixelated backgrounds for a year or two.

All help greatly apprec!

**Edit the First:**  Thanks all -- very good builds so far.   I will look at the up/down votes on Monday and use the [Wilson Score](http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) to rank them.  Ties will be decided by a man-eating randomizer.

**Update the second:**  OP delivering late - I've tallied the scores and want to congratulate Evan5567 as winner.

I fibbed -- I am not just giving a gift card to Evan5567 but am also giving 1 month  reddit gold to those who contributed top level comments.

This PC will be used mainly for gaming and some possible 3D modeling in the future as well as basic Office programs for work. I’m hoping to run most modern games, Crysis 3, etc. on high to ultra settings. Also want to be able to run future games such as Archeage and Star Citizen in similar ranges.

United States. I do have access to a Microcenter store.

Yes

**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.**

A SSD is required, whether it is front-panel, rear, or both would be nice, but a minimum of 5 USB slots between front and back is necessary. As I believe my Gamecom 780 has 7.1 digital audio, I would prefer to have 7.1 sound options, but 5.1 would be acceptable if necessary.

I do not have a reusable/transferable OS license. I currently use a 64bit Windows 7 OS

**Extra info or specifics:**

I’m pretty biased toward going Intel/Nvidia, “It’s cheaper.” I really like the look and considerations in the Corsair 200R and 300R, but I’ve heard conflicting things about their build quality. I’d prefer a case along those lines if possible. I know very little about the current state of monitors, so any help on the best way to achieve a dual monitor setup would be great. I've gotten into the habit of gaming on one monitor and having a second monitor for guides/internet/voice comms. I have no experience with gaming across multiple monitors, so if it's possible with a build of this description, I'd be interested. I’d also be willing to use my current Acer monitor as my secondary if the budget didn’t allow for a better dual monitor setup. **Also, trying to go for a green/black theme if possible.**",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1chebr/1500_gaming_system_with_a_few_requests/

A few points i would like to make: is it possible to get surround sound output from a computer?

A nice wireless kb/mouse recommendation would help too. Also i would prefer it to look nice, or can i minimize that fan whirring somehow? i plan on keeping the PC in the living room which is where all the other entertainment usually is. Because of that, i also need wireless compatability; I have 30 mbps internet and a n600 router, so i'd like to put that speed to use without wires, is there a way to incorporate that into the build?

This is strictly for non-gaming, normal everyday file work.  My main point of confusion which mobo/CPU combo would give me the best on board graphics, or if it even matters.  Every now and then I'll fire up AutoCAD/sketchup, but I'm not talking workstation requirements here.  I can muddle through AutoCAD ok on what I have now, so obviously I'm not talking real intense stuff.  I figure on-board graphics should be more than enough, and [should be above the X1400 nowadays anyway](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-7.html).  Although I'm not real clear on where the AMD stuff falls...


Other things I want:

- SSD (how important is a running this on a mobo w/ 6gb/s vs. 3 gb/s?)  Storage size isn't too critical

- Highest resolution monitor possible.  I imagine this will be a good chunk of my budget.  I like a lot of real estate on my screen.  I guess around 21.5"" is 'normal'?

- Wireless keyboard/mouse that doesn't feel flimsy/cheap.

- USB 3.0 (thats the future right?)

- Should probably get a sub $20 cheapo DVD drive

Am I correct in that some of these cheaper CPUs(sandy bridge?) only support up to 1066 RAM?  Is that a big difference compared to 1333 or 1600?  I could still stick 1333 in there and it will run at 1066

Here's a list of the parts I've just selected from buildapc for my gaming desktop. As you can see from the title, what do you see that could be improved? This is a $1.5K list here, so I want to make sure of the following things:
-everything will work together (i know it says at the top whether or not everything is compatible
-if this build will be able to run games. And I mean GAME games. And more than one at a time. I have two friends that I mainly play online with. One likes TF2, Dishonored, Prototype 2, things like that. I don't want to have to play on low quality graphic either, I want to play with everything set to max.
-this will last a long time (duh). nobody wants to spend more than a thousand dollars on something that won't last a while.
This part here is kind of off- topic, I know, Mac has little to know games/ software available, but hear me out. Though my main purpose is gaming, I also run a (unsuccessful, so far) YouTube channel that I enjoy making and editing videos for. My friend, who owns a Mac

**UPDATE:** So I went ahead with [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1jgdmd/1400_for_an_oculus_rift_pc_fps_top_priority/cbem8y4) configuration (Thanks again, motherboard, memory, case, power supply, and assembled everything yesterday (except for the Hard Drive and dual graphics cards which should arrive today). 

Did I mention this is my first time building, it went fairly smoothly. Here are some of my impression...


* Installing the CPU into the Motherboard was the funnest part. Felt like James Bond (dis)arming a nuclear warhead. 

* Deciphering the parts, the manual got a lot of it wrong (see more about that below).  

* The only hard part of installing the RAM memory was figuring out which slots to use (Dual Channel Memory Technology). This was the only part of the motherboard manual that used ""tech speak"" instead of plain English. HOPEFULLY

* The power supply should have been the easiest part. But the manual (which is not very impressive) left out one very important step. Do I place the power supply fan side up or fan side down? Whoever wrote their manual must think this so obvious that they don't even address it. Not even with a picture showing the unit properly seated inside a case. I had to watch several youtube videos before I learned that it can go either way

* The hardest part of the entire build is connecting each and every wire and cable from each and every component to the right pins on the motherboard. The components with the worst manuals (the case) were the hardest. 

* Apparently, and LED wires from the front panel to the motherboard is notoriously confusing in every build. Even when the manual doesn't get it wrong. 

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WITH THE CASE: 

* Each front panel cable in the case is made up of two wires (colored and black) and ends in two pin ports. Some of the ports are marked ""+"" and ""-"". Some aren't. Meanwhile, or GROUND. The case manual states that ""all BLACK pin connectors correspond to GROUND."" But some of the black wired ports are marked as negative ""-"" opposed to the other port marked positive ""+"". So which is it? Or do ""-"" and GROUND mean the same thing? This gets even more confusing when looking for the corresponding pins on the motherboard, where pins are marked as ""+"", ""-"" or GROUND. Confused? I sure as hell was. HOPE I GOT IT RIGHT!

* The manual warns to ""always attach the WHITE wire to ground."" But there is no WHITE wire. What the hell are they talking about?

* There are TWO separate pin ports on the motherboard designated for the ""P+LED and P-LED"" front panel wires. So which port is the right one? Even more confusing, and ground), while the LED wires only have two ports (+, -). If GROUND and ""-"" are the same thing, which do I choose? If ground and ""-"" aren't the same thing, did I do the other connections wrong? HOPE I GOT IT RIGHT! 

* The case manual identifies each of its wires by color and the written word along its plug. (Example: The manual states ""The Power Button wire is purple and black


Here's a list of DO NOT DO's I was unaware of until now:

* DO NOT lay your motherboard on the anti-static bag that it came in

* Do not screw your motherboard directly onto the case. Included with your case should be a bag of little brass screws called STAND-OFFS. Take a piece of paper and mark where each of the screw holes are on your motherboard. Lay the paper in your case where the motherboard will go

* The motherboard manual will be your main manual. You will need the other manuals

If anyone has a suggestion

**UPDATE 2:** I installed the Hard Drive. Very easy. Then I installed both GeForce GTX 770 cards. Unfortunately the SLI Bridge card that came with my motherboard does not fit over the cards. (The bridge is a hard piece of board

At the Moment I just want a computer that can at least handle most new games. I play anything from Minecraft to Planetside 2 to Civilization 5 to Battlefield 3 (and hopefully 4). I am willing and likely to upgrade some of the components in the next few years as I am going to Air Force BMT in September and will be in for 6 years minimum. I do not currently have a job and my Mom is currently funding this as a present for joining the Air Force so the Budget is kind of strict at the moment.

A quick pre-amble: The budget is largely to be determined based on what I need to spend to achieve my goals below. Probably the biggest thing I want is something VERY upgradable to scale with demands of games over the next few years. I was thinking of getting an SLI/CF compatible board, I've been looking at the GeForce 780, but I really don't have a sense anymore of if that's way overkill or in keeping with what I'm looking for. Anyway, here's the standard stuff:

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation

Gaming. I'm looking at games like Skyrim, when it comes out, The Witcher 3. The Witcher is probably the main target: I want a system that will really rock it. I saw one developer interview that stated they were currently running it on Titans pre-optimazations which is why I was looking at the 780 as a (somewhat) cheaper alternative. Ideally I'd like to max settings for this game, assuming the cost of the comp isn't astronomical. Oh, and I'd like to max Crysis 3.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Largely TBD based on feedback I get from this, Titans over the 780 is ~$400 more for only a slight increase).

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

Sometime in the next 3 months. I may end up waiting to get better prices

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

Canada. I've never heard of Microcenter

&gt;If reusing any parts

Monitor: Apple Cinema Display with Thunderbolt

My housemate needs to stream games for her job. This post on the frontpage really interested me:

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1fogkv/build_complete_the_little_box_that_could_my_first/

It's a small-form factor device that gets a lot for a little. This is the sort of thing that would be perfect: Good results, the primary function of our PC is that it needs to be able to stream: it needs to be able to output 1080p footage at a consistent rate. 

Would that guy's build need any modification? Is this possible? I'm not sure what sort of resources streaming uses

tl:dr:

* Need to be as cheap as possible

* Needs to be able to stream games at 1080p

* Needs to be as small as possible

Thanks to everyone for their help.  As usual

Congrats to eagleslanding and sierpinski13.  I wound up deviating quite a bit, and the power supply discussion on sierpinski13 was very informative.  Same can be said for Xeon debate.  I probably should have gone Xeon and saved $100 but i7-3770k was just too tempting.

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation

The main use for this PC is web development.  I run linux and right now my main programs I use are Gedit (text editor), and 8 testing and photoshop, chrome, firefox, and many console windows.

I also plan on purchasing a 30"" 2560x1600 monitor.  I've been leaning towards this one offered by [monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=113&amp;cp_id=11307&amp;cs_id=1130703&amp;p_id=10234&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2)

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

With monitor and keyboard

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now
As soon as possible.  Really want to get the new monitor

&gt;What, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?
Monitor, Memory, graphics card, CPU, power supply, keyboard (cherry MX, thinking brown but can be persuaded elsewhere too)

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US
In US

&gt;If reusing any parts
I want to use a 30"" IPS monitor listed above.  All other items need purchased.  I could probably re-use my power supply since it's fairly new

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes
If it can be done ""easily"" sure

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.
I want to have USB 3.0 ports accessible from the front of the machine.  Also

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes
Ubuntu

&gt;Extra info or specifics:
I don't ""plan"" on gaming on this machine...but I'm a bit concerned that an awesome rig and display may make this a tempting proposition.

Here's some ramblings on my thoughts on this overall:

I've been looking at things a bit and the i5-3570k looks like a pretty nice processor.  Seems like i7 is overkill for most folks.  i5 might even be overkill for what I want to do

I really want to be able to have as many things open as I want -- I have probably 50+ tabs open at any one time across a few instances of chrome (I know it's ridiculous) and I've kind of gotten irritated by how slow the virtuals run (I think they're memory bound as I only have 8gb right now so each is limited to 1 to 2gb right now)

There are a couple variants of the monitor I'm looking at

I'm also open to suggestions on the monitor as well.  Monoprice is usually my first choice for anything they sell

I also am sort of justifying this purchase (specifically SSD) as I want to be able to suspend this thing and turn it off when it's not in use.  My power bills are obnoxious between my desktop and old oven/server AMD Phenom X4 so I want to be able to suspend and turn back on immediately.

On the keyboard I've been looking at the Cherry mx brown ones.  Again

One other point.  This server will live in a closet about 10 feet from me.  I plan on wiring the dvi/displayport/hdmi through the crawlspace

Basically it's just coming up on 5 years of no upgrades and this is my bread and butter so I want to be more productive and save some energy (via quicker bootup / suspend).  

I spend my whole day on a computer and have built my last few

The author of the build I choose will receive a $20 amazon card.

2 other points when considering total cost:
I have a shoprunner membership
I have a prime membership so Amazon (or fulfilled) shipping is free.
I live by a best buy

In the whole build noise is not an issue because I'm with earphones all the time, but temperature maybe is. Budget tops at 2000€ including the monitors.

A good friend of mine needs to get her autistic son a new computer. He's pretty high functioning.  He sent me a list of what he uses his computer for. He's a gamer for certain. I would put him in the 7-8 out if 10 range based on the games he listed.  From MineCraft to the very high end

Though he struggles with performance and space as he's currently doing all this on an older laptop. I can't imagine how happy he will be to see a game in hi-res with all features on at 28-30 inches.  His attention to detail tells me these changes won't go unnoticed. 

But he also plays with CAD apps, after hearing a bit more, I'm not sure it's the best idea. I would forever be bound to keeping the computer working. He doesn't seem to currently have any interest in the internals of a computer. 

This may change as he gets older

His Mom promised him a new computer and its been a while so he is anxious to get one. 

I don't know what to recommend. Just send her to Alienware and configure up an Aurora or I did a google search for 2012 reviews of gaming pc's which shows rather impressive specs on their first pick.

I plan to use this PC primarily for gaming.  I've had a snail for years and was hoping that building my own PC (this will be my first build) will get me pretty good performance for the money I have to spend on it.  I just don't want to worry anymore if I'm buying a game whether or not I can run it and it will look nice.

My max budget is $750 but I'd rather shoot for around 700 if possible.

Homeserver and workstation. 

This PC should serve several purposes. 
a) Be the center of my office. I have two 23° monitors (DVI/vga) that I want to hook up. Applications will be gVim &amp; LaTeX

b) Serve as a media center. Nothing special here... connection via HDMI to my TV and sound system. No fancy soundcard necessary. mpd wil be used for the music.

Germany

&gt;If reusing any parts

I'm using an i3-330 on a ECS H55H-I in a Lian Li at the moment. Other than the two 2TB drives

Two 23° monitors (1920xwhatever) and a 32° fullHD TV.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

No! Rather undervolting than ocing.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

Three monitors at the same time, but not completely necessary. Gigabit ethernet should be standard in 2013, no? WLan is not necessary, but nice if it's there. Everything else is optional.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

Silence would be nice. Watercooling would be overshooting it

No LEDs or something like that necessary. I'd rather prefer it if there were no lights at all. 

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

... Linux. Probably Fedora


Main thing I'm worrying about is the three monitors under linux. I'd definitely prefer an Haswell setup without dedicated GPU, at least not using their natives resolutions. 

I've heard many good things about the Haswell

I wouldn't mind overclocking further down the road. When the pc starts feeling slow. I would prefer to keep it with stock coolers and then add some nice coolers in a few years ( should be fun). So yes overclockable parts are a plus. Both CPU and GPU.

No. I'm going to be using headphones and I don't care about power usage. I'm renting so if a CPU is really inefficient and loud but powerful or cheaper go for that.

I got redircted here from this [/r/buildapc post](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1fx39y/build_help_low_cost_htpc_300) :)  
  
I'd like to build a low cost HTPC for (if possible) less than $300.  
  
This is what I'd like the HTPC to do:  
* Play a variety of different movie formats stored on external HDDs.  
* Be powerful enough to rip DVDs/Blurays (with an external optical drive)  
* Connect through HDMI and be powerful enough to play Full HD content  
* I have an Elgato EyeTV which I'd like to connect to it so I can record shows; therefor an internal HDD would be nice  
* It should be as small as possible - I guess mini-ITX would be great  
* It should be quiet :)  
* As for the OS I was thinking about Windows (7 or 8) as well as XMBC for movies and such... but I already have a copy of these OS' so no need to include in price :)
  
  
I do not want an internal optical drive - since I already have an external drive. It might make the case smaller as well :) 
  

From what I understand is that I only need a mainboard &amp; processor, internal HDD and a case. Does this sound correct?

Thunderbolt is preferable. HDMI out (as said earlier) would be cool. Lots of storage space and an SSD. I dig minimal styling when it comes to the case. So far I've seen some fractal-design cases I like. Anything else like that (or one of theirs) would be good.

I have the potential to get an Intel processor for a substantial discount, is there anything in particular I should keep in mind for being able to augment the pc down the line with newer or different parts?

**Pointless Exposition**

I've been looking to build a pc for a little while now and I've been doing a good amount of research, I have been saving up for a while now and would be happy to spend 2000 dollars, perhaps even a little more. I assume it goes fast, especially since I have absolutely nothing currently other than a dinky monitor and keyboard and mouse I am eager to replace. Also, I live in the US.

**PC Uses**

Anyway

**1)** A component in a sort of home theater system. So

**2)** An audio recording and editing station. I don't know much about how this would work beyond purchasing an audio interface and studio monitors. Does the kind of stuff that is done by the PC for this require a good CPU

**3)** An image storing and editing tool for an aspiring photographer/designer. I imagine

**4)** A tool for video editing. A good GPU

**5)** A sort of playground for a learning computer and programming enthusiast. I assume I am eventually going to want to run VMs and do other weird stuff I don't know about yet.

**6)** As good a gaming computer as possible while still satisfying the other conditions and falling into the budget. It doesn't need to be amazing as this isn't a top priority. Being able to run stuff like Morrowind and Oddworld would be desirable and I assume relatively simple(?)

**Neuroses Which May Affect Components**

As you can tell I'm not 100% sure what the heck I'm doing. Here is a tidbit about me which may help: I am a bit of a weenie. I like to play it safe whenever possible. So I probably won't be overclocking (which I assume means I won't need an Intel cpu ending in 'k'?). I'm sort of neurotic about things. In fact, quietest pc I could possibly get. If underclocking is a thing that people actually do (I know it at least exists because I've seen the word) then I would probably be happy to do it most of the time. Though I'm not absolutely familiar with how it works or the terminology I would also like to run two HDDs in a RAID 1 set-up. So unfortunately this is the kind of person you'll be helping out here, sorry. 

**My Limited Knowledge of Parts / What I've Been Recommended**

As far as specific parts, but again, I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing, and there are a lot of them. Benchmarks are helpful but mostly I see them discussing games, which isn't my main concern. Someone has suggested the 3820 because it uses a newer socket (the LGA-2011 I think?) which apparently is better but I do not know exactly why, and though I have heard it would make for easy upgrades to 39xx cpus (or something of the sort) I have also heard the word Haswell being tossed around by naysayers saying not to bother. 

I know nothing about the **motherboard**. Most people tell me to just shush and pick everything else out first and then the motherboard will practically choose itself given that it relies on the cpu socket and how many SATA and PCI-e connections I want. I do not know how true this is.

Regarding the **memory** situation, or do they come in more than that? And if not, would I need a specific cpu and motherboard to do this?


For **storage**, so I don't know what I should believe. 3TB and with a nice long warranty would be ideal. I've also been told that I wouldn't regret, with the money I am willing to spend, purchasing an SSD for my OSes (I was thinking of dual-booting with Windows and Linux) and my most heavily used applications. Don't know much about that. 

The **video card** I haven't done much research on although I realize it's pretty important. 

The same thing goes for the **case**. Mostly I want it to be well-ventilated above all else. I don't care that much how it looks

The **power supply** I know absolutely nothing about. I assume it just comes down to how much power I would need

As far as **other stuff**

**TL;DR**

I want to make a pc that can be used for lots of stuff: watching movies in a home theater, image and photo editing, programming and generally geekily screwing around, and medium gaming if at all possible. I'd very much like to have two HDDs set-up in RAID 1 as well as an SSD. I like to prioritize stability and safety and reliability, if that at all affects the build (so I probably won't overclock with this). I have around 2000 dollars to spend, though going slightly over isn't impossible. I need an operating system as well (and would like Windows) and it would be nice to also be able to get a monitor. 

**Closing**

So would these monitors be OK to try again with a new build or should I buy some new ones? New build should be able to run dual monitors as well.

I also already have a keyboard/mice. Need some suggestions on an OS and where to get it cheapest(seen lots recommend W7 still).

I read up on overclocking and I'm still a bit confused on what this is so don't think I will need to do any of that.

Other details:

- No need for a mouse/monitor/keyboard/OS

- As for the HD

- I don't need overclocking although hopefully the budget will allow for a build that won't go obsolete in a few years. If it will

- I do live reasonably near a microcenter. Don't know if this is important or not

I've thrown together these two potential builds for my parents

In all reality they will just be using it for light stuff.  Internet, office.  Probably not much more.  While I know future proofing is hard, I would like the system to be somewhat upgradeable.  I don't want to tell them a few years down the line that they need a whole new system.  I'd rather be able to upgrade specific parts to cut costs.

What do you think?  Would one be better for them than the other?  Are one or both of them overkill for the intended use?  If I could save some downgrading

I'm definitely open to any suggestions.

**NOTE:** Please don't tell me which is a better build.  I'm not asking which is better in general.  I'm looking for what is best specific to the needs stated above.

Thanks!

I am currently torn on upgrading the current pc or building a new one. I don't have too much to spend maybe 3-400 but need help deciding. The computer is used for work and as a media center pc. Sometimes I work from home testing web pages so i like to have all browsers open and some virtual box images open as well. When i'm not using the computer for work I mostly watch movies from my media library or play music. I don't play any games other than an occasional flash game or maybe an old sim city. Would like to make more music or edit video on it in the next couple years.  

My main problem now is last time I built this system it was mostly on hand me down parts a couple years back. SSDs were just coming out and grabbed a small 60gb for my boot drive now it's nearly full. Currently fluctuating from 11-6gb free and I think this is contributing to the general slowness of the computer as it improves when i uninstall some things. So obviously i need to upgrade this small ssd. My memory is also kinda low by today's standards. currently running only 4gb. I plan on building it myself I have build a few pc's but as the years progress i find more and more acronyms and specs polluting my impressions on what is best case scenarios. I currently live in the san diego

currently on the following:

* Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) Service Pack 1 (build 7601)
* 2.66 gigahertz Intel Core2 Duo
* Zalman ZF9225ATH Aero Flower Silent CPU Cooler LGA775 
* MB: ASUSTeK Computer INC. P5K SE Rev 1

* CSSD-V60GB2 [Hard drive] (60.02 GB)
* ST2000DL003-9VT166 [Hard drive] (2000.40 GB) data - documents music and videos
* NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS [Display adapter]
* VIZ VO47LFHDTV10A [Monitor] (47.1"")
* Atheros L1 Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Controller
 connected to a Motorola SBG6580 DOCSIS 3.0 router and cox premier @ 31 Mbps / 3 Mbps
* ASUS DRW-24B1LT ATA Device [Optical drive]
* Power Supply: pS cooler master RS-600-PCARE3
* Antec Nine Hundred Black Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case


I'm hoping to use as many pieces from my current setup to offset the cost of rebuilding an entirely new system. I see some systems in the $300-$400 range on here just torn between a complete rebuild or replacing boot SSD with a larger one and and upgrading the memory to 8gb max the current set up has.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

Within the next week

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

CPU, HDD &amp; SSD, graphics card, case, power supply, monitor, keyboard

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US

US

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

I'd like to

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

Nothing too expensive in the way of an SSD (I probably don't need much more than 150 at most)

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

A case window, but aren't 100% necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

Gaming, a lot of open world, and MMO games. I'd very much like to use the highest settings.

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

Maximum budget of $1200

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

Within the next few days

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

Tower, Mechanical Keyboard, Gaming Mouse, Monitor (one to start with, but I will be switching to a dual setup), WiFi I'd like to be built into the motherboard (but getting an adapter wouldn't break my heart). I really do need everything but speakers and headphones, I'm upgrading from a 7 year old refurbished laptop. Edit: I forget to include a dvd drive/burner (possibly Bluray?)

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US

US

&gt;If reusing any parts

Nothing reused.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

My preference is no.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

I support having USB 3.0/2.0 all over the place. My current laptop only has one USB port and it's been the bane of my existence.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

I could definitely go for a window on a blue tower. No LED's. And just as long as they aren't super loud components.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

I'll need brand new Windows 7/8.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

If the peripherals are going to glow I'd prefer they do so in blue.


Any and all suggestions would be welcome
Thanks from this first time builder.

Here's what i'm looking for specifically:

&gt;What will you be doing with this PC?

Mostly running 2d/3d modeling and animation softwares like Maya, etc... Some adobe programs like photoshop, illusrator, flash, after effects... also, i frequently use Ableton Live 9 and other audio editing software, so good audio is a must. On the side, Battlefield 4, etc... Focus more on the professional/school stuff though

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

~$2000

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC?

start ordering parts this weekend if possible (August 16-18

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

As said below, etc. I'll need the tower case, mobo, cpu, gpu, storage drives (preferably NOT SSD unless you can explain why this might be beneficial to my uses, they're pretty expensive), RAM, i just don't want to leave anything out for y'all) Oh

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?

US

&gt;If reusing any parts

I have a usb mouse, and usb powered microphone/headphones with 3.5mm microphone and audio plugs, and a Wacom Cintiq 21UX pen display, which runs through vga and usb plugs. As you can see, those are all externals, so i will not be bringing over any internal parts.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

As mentioned in carry-over section, one 3.5mm microphone output jack, one 3.5mm audio output jack, at least 2 usb ports (up to 4 preferable), and an ethernet wired internet port (if wireless internet capabilities would be possible for a little more, i'd be okay with the added versatility). In terms of internals, I'm gonna need a kickass gpu (and kickass video cards(s)  ) for fast/powerful rendering, and a decent amount of storage space (~1tb?). My first and foremost use for the rig will be rendering animations and doing lots of visual work, not 100% on that

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

Focus on the performance aspects first, but don't sacrifice performance for volume. Also, i imagine it will need a pretty good cooling system since it will be used quite a lot for long, intense renderings.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

No. I like the layout of windows 7
