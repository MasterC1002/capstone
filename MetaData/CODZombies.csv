1366324428.0,1cmzmw,Someone needs to say it. The campaign team did Zombies right with MotD. (Spoilers),Dragoon893,146,20,56,"They made a very unique thing here.

Let me start with the Easter Egg. It's a moderate difficulty. Enough to where it isn't too easy but not too hard to where casual players could not complete it. The best thing they did with it, and also the reason that makes this EE better than the other two, is that people don't always have three others who can play at the same time, want to complete the EE, have the map, etc. It allows you to just grab someone that you KNOW can and wants to do the EE, and just do it! And the fact that they made it an EE that actually *ends the game* is just awesome, as no other EE has done so before.

Now, creepy, and the largest to date. The traps are unique, and simply awesome. (Personally, I *love* the Sniper Tower.) The box has had a complete redesign, which fits the atmosphere of the map perfectly. They added a new perk, Electric Cherry. that works perfectly in conjunction with an already existing perk, they seem to be far more terrifying. The inclusion of the Afterlife Mode has given a new spin on zombies, in a sense. It's pretty awesome.

They also redesigned the HUD, I find it kinda neat.

All in all

Edit: Typos.

**IMPORTANT EDIT:** Mob of the Dead was made by the campaign team. The zombies team had little impact on it at all. The reason for this is that they wanted to focus on the next map. Stop saying the zombies team had a major input,False,self,t5_2sal9,1366345109.0,,scavenger,t3_1cmzmw

When referring to permanent perks I mean perks that carry over from game to game.  This post will serve as a main area to:

* What we know about the perks
* What has worked

1372965887.0,1hnewb,[Buried Spoilers] Detailed Full Written Guide on How to Complete Richtofen's Easter Egg,WildWargasm,130,13,43,"Hello! Here is a full written guide on how to tackle the obstacles in Richtofen's side of the Easter Egg on Buried. I will update it with pictures and extra information over time. If any of my information is incorrect


**NOTES BEFORE STARTING:**

* It is highly recommended to start the Easter Egg on either Round 1 or 2, it makes it easier for you to complete the Easter Egg. 

* Players may need a good amount of money in the bank (maybe 25, and spend money on the box to get the desired weapons.

* A team of 4 is needed. No less.

* In terms of weaponry, and Galvaknuckles/Bowie Knife.

* You can get a free perk from the ghost lady by going into her house and killing her off when you see lights in the windows of the Mansion

* Perks highly recommended for this Easter Egg include Staminup and Vulture Aid

**1) Build the Guillotine (4 Parts)**

The first step is to build the guillotine located in the dark alleyway beside the Saloon. In order to do Richtofen's side of the Easter Egg

* Satellite Dish found on top of Saloon
* Thin satellite in the first floor of the Barn
* Pink Crystal found in the upper tunnels across the part
* Spool of Wire/Wool found in the Gunsmith beside the little iron oven

**2) Charge the Red Orbs using the Paralyzer Wonder Weapon**

Shoot your paralyzer at the red orbs and hold until you see them completely change colour and make a noise. It should not take more than 5 seconds per orb. 

* Orb in the alleyway beside the Saloon
* Orb beside the Church
* Orb in the upper tunnels
* Orb in the garden before entering the maze. It's close to the entrance when you head back into the mansion from the maze

**3) Knock down the Floating Purple Lantern**

A floating purple lantern will appear around the church/mansion area. It will continue to float around the town until it is knocked down. You can knock it down by properly timing a frag grenade and letting it explode near the lantern. Pick up the lantern by running over it. Once you pick it up you cannot drop it and give it to another person.

Note: If the lantern is dropped on a place where you cannot reach it

**4) Charge the Lantern**

Go into the mansion and kill witches to 'charge the lantern.' Every player will hear chimes after each kill. 8 or so kills should be enough to charge the lantern. An audio cue will be given/chimes will stop ringing once the lantern is fully charged.

**5) Place the Lantern**

If the lantern is fully charged

**6) The Cipher**

A cipher/code will appear on the wall next to the glowing purple lantern symbol after the lantern is placed. Deciphering the code will reveal the order of wooden signs (located in the tunnels) you need to hit on the next step. There are 3 rows of code. Each row indicats a different wooden sign. The order of signs is different for every game so you will need to learn how to decode at least the first letter of each sign or get a picture to compare with. [Someone else made a great video teaching you how to decode this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1hoxua/how_to_decode_the_symbols_on_buried/) ***DO NOT HIT THE SIGNS YET***.

The signs include:

- Dry Gulch Shaft 

- Lunger Undermines

- Ground Biter Pits

- Bone... (forgot the next bit)

- Corro... (forgot the next bit)

Realistically

**7) IMPORTANT! Placing the Time Bomb**

After uncovering the cipher and before hitting the signs

**8) The Orb Chase/Hitting the Signs**

Before starting this step

One player needs the Galvaknuckles OR Bowie Knife and needs to head up into the tunnels knowing the correct order of signs to hit, you simply need to run over and touch the blue orb. However, after touching the orb, it will move to a new location. You can only see this orb through the map if you have Vulture Aid. Here is how you complete this step:

* Position your teammates throughout the map with one person up in the tunnels to hit the signs
* Once the 3rd and final sign is hit
* Have the person closest to the orb's new position touch it and be sure to call it out
* The orb will then move to a new position. Have the person closest to the orb's new position touch it again
* You need to touch the orb about 6 or 7 times in order for this step to be complete
* The orb will

**9) Charging the Crystal**

Once the orb has reached it's final spot at the guillotine, like I recommended, this will be easy.

**10) Going back in Time/Infinity Mode**

Once the Crystal has 5 glowing orbs flying around it, however, to **read the next step** before activating the time bomb.

**11) Infinity Mode and Finding the Switch**

NOTE: In Infinity Mode

In Infinity Mode, a little text will appear at the top of everyone's game saying ""There is nothing here..."" or something like that. When the switch is found on one of four bodies, rejoice and celebrate! 

Note: If the player who found the switch is downed in Infinity Mode

**If you cannot find the switch in time:** Start up a new round and look for a Max Ammo to refuel your time bombs. You can just use another time bomb on a guillotine at any round/time to be sent back into Infinity Mode to try again.

**12) Add the switch to the Guillotine**

Add the switch to the guillotine. I don't think you have to pull it but pull it if the option allows.

**13) The Maze and Coloured Levers**

In the maze, Blue, Yellow. You will need to hit these levers in the correct order to move onto the next step. Doing this step requires a small degree of trial and error because the order changes for each game. Here is how to complete this step:

* Find all four doors and have each person stand at a different coloured lever
* Make sure someone is ready to write down the order and make notes as you go along
* Hit the levers in any order
* Once the last lever is pulled, if one of them sparks, make a note of which colour it was and if it was pulled 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
* In our example, when we try a different order, we keep YELLOW pulled second and change up the other ones.
* Head through the mansion and back into the maze again to reset the levers. Continue changing up the order and look for sparks to get the correct order.
* Once the correct order is found

**13) Make a Wish**

Go to the fountain in front of the mansion (in the town) to make a wish. You will be able to press X by the fountain. It should not matter if the fountain is broken or still in one piece. 

**14) 'Sharpshooter' Firing at the Targets**

A bunch of targets will then pop out around the map. They should appear in 4 locations: In Front of Courtroom, and by the Jail. Position your teammates around by these locations and fire at the targets. Make sure to hit them all as quickly as possible because you are on a time constraint. You should be able to start again by making another wish.

* Take a break to just make a wish and look at your targets. Make sure you don't have a target that you are missing every single time.
* I recommend using the PDW with an M16 as your secondary. When your PDW is low on ammo
* I also recommend getting a crawler and using Candy near that crawler to make the giant pick it up. For this

**15) Achievement Unlocked**

And hey if they want to round it to a multiple of 5 (because all map packs usually have 5 maps (multiplayer/zombies)) then they can give us 4 new zombie maps idk but the big idea is bringing back all of those old zombie maps maybe even with WaW/Black ops guns.

Just an idea

1354745370.0,14chy7,I know exactly how the Zombie Ranking System works.  Details inside!,appac1010,97,9,42,"Below is a detailed explanation of how the ranking system for zombies works.  It's quite long

**Claim 1:  Ranks are based on a percentage system**

This claim is the most well known

__*Evidence*:  Many players have reported a lowering of their rank from not playing zombies.  The reason for this is that when you don't play for a while

**Claim 2:  The dashes are completely independent of the symbols**

In other words

__*Evidence*:  Many players have moved from one symbol to another without a change in the number of dashes.  Here's an example: Lets say that you have a regular skull with three dashes.  It is possible to become a skull with a dagger while retaining the three dashes.  This has actually happened to me yesterday while I was testing theories.  

__*Side note:  This may be quite obvious to many people

**Claim 3:  The symbol that you have is completely based on the sum of your rounds**

This was one of my great discoveries yesterday.  The symbol that you have (skull, etc) depends on the total amount of rounds that you have on the leaderboards.  For example, lets say that you only play town survival.  Your records on the leaderboards are 13, 20, 10, and 24 for 1 player, 2 players, so your total round number is 67.  You need a certain total round number for each rank

__*Evidence*:  I have tested this theory by playing on two and three player modes (I held a record of 0 on each) for different maps.  I literally jumped from the skull to the dagger in 2 short games.  This cannot be based off of kills, etc, because the short matches I played  had insignificant effects on these parameters.  The only significant change was the total round number, therefore I feel it safe to conclude claim 3.  

**Claim 4:  The number of dashes that you have is based off of the other parameters, revives, accuracy, etc**

__*Evidence*: This one is a given.  I had multiple matches in which I attempted to maximize the amount of times that I died, and as expected, I regained my dashes.  The exact relationship is still unknown however.  But I believe that the amount of dashes is based on ratios rather than the shear number of each parameter.  

These are all of my claims.  I have more supporting evidence for a couple of these, comments, or contradictory events to report, please leave a comment.  

*Note:  If I can obtain enough data, downs, etc, and calculate what your rank should be.  This could prove to be useful in predicting necessary requirements for ranking up.  I will need at least 100 trials, with the corresponding number of dashes that you have.  

**TL;DR:  READ EVERYTHING IN BOLD**

###Confirmed Persistent Perks

**************
| Perk  | Description   | How to Lose     |    | 
|:-----------|:------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| **Faster Revive**|    The player can earn faster revives (revives are twice as fast) by reviving downed allies 2-17 times in one game. The effect can be stacked with Quick Revive.      |     To lose it
| **More Headshot Damage**  |    The player can earn increased headshot damage by getting an arbitrary amount of collateral headshots (multiple headshot kills with 1 bullet). In addition to increased headshot damage, though the persistent upgrade will not be applied.     |  To lose it, the player must kill 25-75 zombies in a row without a headshot.   |  [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzsD1nZmzdk)
| **Stronger Barriers**       |        The player can earn stronger barriers to be built on windows by repairing 250 barriers in one game. The barriers are partially made of steel and screwed in
| **Jugg+**        |          This perk effectively doubles the player's health, the player must let himself be downed without Quick Revive, and thereby end the game, about 3 times.|     To lose it, the player must die on or after round fifteen while teammates are still alive. |[Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u45M6nKppkk)
| **Super Insta-Kill**  |    The player can earn a subversion of Insta-Kill by not killing a single zombie during an Insta-Kill, the player must be damaged by a zombie during the Insta-Kill (with the exception of a flaming zombie exploding).| [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhbeDWGb1UY)   
| **Cash Back**       |        The player can earn an upgrade to give 1000 points every time when going prone in front of a Perk-a-Cola machine after buying said perk. This ability is obtained by going in front of the machine a random amount of times after buying it. |   To lose it
| **PhD Flopper**        |          This perk is achieved when the player takes a certain amount of fall damage 5-10 times. When achieved
| **Mystery Box Perk**  |    This perk is achieved when the player gets a lot of ""bad"" weapons from the Mystery Box. At that point the player will see a glow and a teddy bear appears on the box. The player is then on granted a higher likelihood of receiving better weapons from the mystery box. ""Bad"" weapons include, FAL, SMR, Barrett M82A1, War Machine, M8A1. |  This Perk is automatically lost at the start of round 10 or when too many good weapons are given from the box.   | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3c7HBCmCw)
| **Half-Off**       |        This perk is achieved when the player picks up a 2x power up and does not gain any points during the entire duration of the power up. the next time the player picks up a 2x power up you will receive the perk. This perk reduces the cost of everything by 50%. This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the next Double Points|   This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the next Double Points | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1w8CHF-Mg)
| **Tombstone**  *under review*       |          There are multiple theories on what it take to obtain this perk.  I will list all of them and please report to me which one has the best success rate.  First way is to buy four perks in one round
| **Extra Sniper Points**  |    Get 10 kills at long distance with the sniper rifle. Once the perk is obtained each sniper kill will give you 350 points + per zombie kill
| **Extra Pistol Points**  |    Shoot and miss with your pistols until your accuracy is extremely low. Once the perk is obtained each pistol shot will give you double points. |  This perk can be lost by increasing your pistol accuracy.  | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovR8f963cew)
| **Ray Gun Olympia**                 *under review*  |    There are multiple theories on how to obtain this perk.  One is that any new player(players with one or two bones) will receive the Ray Gun when buying the Olympia

1370329584.0,1fmzt7,Tower of Babel/DLC Connection Theory,BigRaxN24Pax,107,27,42,"EDIT2: I want to clarify that I'm not 100% sold on the whole

So just like I try to say in my title, what can we speculate? We have pretty much made our mind up that the best we can guess is that it will be ""paradise-esque,"" but given the past of zombies what are some REALISTIC options that we can choose from?  From what I can gather, it is no surprise that there are hints/teasers/EE of future maps in various zombies maps of the past. I think Moon was one of the one ones teased in a previous map, I really just don't feel like looking into it (I'm sure one of you knows and could inform us all in the comments, thank you). So in BO2 Zombies what paradise like place has been hinted towards to TWICE now with the 2 DLCs AND coincidentally was the name of the major EE of the original BO2 map? You guessed it, The Tower of Babel. Now before you say, you think it's gonna be on a spiral tower?? You must ride the short bus..."" I don't think the next DLC map will be located at the ToB. I just think the map will take place right next to it
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon  ---  

There is the Wikipedia link on the hanging gardens of babylon, hell that's why it's a theory, but I honestly feel like it is a legit possibility. Plus how amazing would a map like that be?? Outdoors in a beautiful lush garden *paradise* set in the middle east near the Mediterranean.  And the place is a giant palace, the interior could be an amazing intricate exploration and you never know how high, or low, you could go inside! And since time/space travel are synonymous when the Gardens were actually in use vs. destroyed wouldn't matter. ALSO another tie in is how the ToB is linked to how ""the world split into different languages"" and how the group is split between the voices/MaxisRichtofen and then additionally Sthulinger with his extra headvoice. IDK, I thought for a theory this was a damn plausible one. Let me know what you think.

Now I think this is the only other multiplayer map in any COD game to have the book expect the original Nuketown

After I decided to explore both maps more in depth. In Nuketown 2025 [I found the disc that is next to the TV in Nuketown Zombies.](http://imgur.com/BXJOi3g) So I went into Hijack to see if there was anything similar
it seems pretty similar considering that the stand looks similar and are both circular with an open center. 

So I could not find anything else in Nuketown except some Alien toys but that's it. So I decided to look around Hijack again and [I found this.](http://imgur.com/Yrl1IEt) It's the Nuketown symbol. Why would Trearch put so much detail into something so small. Are they trying to tell us something?

1.  All four players must stand on the symbols on the top of the elevators at the same time. (The elevators with the the symbols are; the the one on the same wall as the power switch in the power room, they will begin to glow.

2. Next you have to activate the same symbols again, by the 74u, and by the SVU but down the stairs and to the right. Again you have to step on them in a certain order until they all light up and you hear Richtofen speak. 

1. A player must buy the SVU or any sniper

1. Now a player must get the Sliquifier and start to shoot the balls

1. Next, launching them into the tower, Richtofen will keep saying to do more until the tower turns slightly blue.

 1. Next you will have to get Galva Knuckles and punch the towers legs. The order inwich you punch them is random and to find out what the order is, south, west) corresponds with a number tiles (1,2,3,4) by matching the colors. You then punch the legs in that order, and you will unlock the achievement. 



**Maxis**

1. This side starts off with the same 3 steps as Richtofen's.

1. This is wear its different, its red) And kill zombies, Maxis will say more, more, until eventually he will say enough.

1. Now, and Stu has to revive him with the PAP Balistics knife.

1.  Now every player must get a Tramplesteam again, so they get launched back and forth between them. Make sure they crisscross each other in an ""X"".

1.  Finally you do the same last step as the Richtofen

First let me talk about the Original Double Tap. It's only effect was to increase your rate of fire, of course your ammo is going to deplenish quicker if you fire at a higher rate. What people don't seem to understand is that when you shoot faster, you kill faster, thus ensuring a higher chance of survivability.

On to Double Tap 2, but slightly less. The main effect is that when you shoot a bullet it is as if you shot two.

Let me elaborate.

You pull the trigger once, less shots to kill means **you save ammo**.

Although, or the Mustang and Sally.

Either way, after juggernog of course.

**TL;DR:** Read all the bold.

     1) Point System

Zombies will spawn all over the place each round and begin coming after you. You get points for killing them. These points are used to buy new guns,"" 50 points for a kill by explosives (Grenades, Claymores, Rocket Launchers, Ray Gun, etc.), 60 points for a kill by a normal gun. However, and the 60 becomes 130 if you melee the zombie to death (with a knife or the Galvaknuckles). Weapons cost anywhere between 500 and 1250 points

     2) Movement

For the first few rounds, with explosives, you can blow a zombies leg/legs off and make it so they can only crawl - this significantly reduces their speed and danger. Zombies can easily be tricked by your movements. The easiest way to play is to loop all the zombies together by running them in lines, then turning and unloading on them (this is called ""training""). For an example of this, check out some of TheSyndicateProject's gameplay videos on Youtube, and you will understand it. However, no matter what you do, No Stopping

     3) Guns

Guns are ready to buy on walls in almost every room. There are SMG's, Assault Rifles, Snipers, and even special weapons (grenades and guns). Special Guns are guns like the Ballistic Knife, Crossbow, and Ray Gun. However, most of these are only available through something called the ""Random Weapon Box."" This Box allows you to open it for 950 points, but the box may move to another Box Spawn location - this is indicated by a teddy bear appearing instead of a gun. Wall guns are generally not as strong, drastically increasing damage, unload your weapon on the zombies! 

     4) Perk-a-Colas (Perks)
 
Perks are available in several locations on almost every map. These perks and their powers are listed in the sidebar. However, speed up your rate of fire, etc. Perks are a big part of the puzzle that is Call of Duty: Zombies. (IF SOMEBODY COULD WRITE UP A PERMA-PERK EXPLANATION THAT'D BE GREEEAT.)

     5) Drops

Drops are randomly given for killing zombies. These include Insta-Kill, Fire Sale, Death Machine, Carpenter, and Nuke. They drop from dead zombies and are gold with a green glow. Make sure to run through them in order to get them, or they'll disappear! They are all temporary effects (excluding Max Ammo). Insta-kill makes zombies die after one hit - whether that be a knife or a shot. This does not mean you are invincible, though! Be careful. Double points doubles the amount of points you gain from actions: 20 points for one hitmarker, etc. This is merely a dog bone to the players. Max Ammo gives you the full amount of ammo in your ammo stock



I will be adding more to this but I have to head off to class. Hope this helps you!

These first few tips are universal tips and for Green Run also. However

I will keep updating this page with each new Grief map.


- For those that don't know, all the enemy will see on his/her screen is ""Press X to throw back grenade"". They actually can't pick up the gun. As long as you keep throwing grenades, the option to pick up the weapon won't appear   

- You can knife players of ledges, shooting directing below at the zombies grouped up. Just knife the unsuspecting player and he'll fall down into the massive group of zombies, heh.

- Make sure you pick up the power ups right away, you won't have it at all. All power up effects don't do anything if the enemy team picks it up. However, a nuke will have a universal effect, killing all zombies. The team who picks it up will be the team to get the 400 points though.

- This is risky and sort of a jerky strategy

- When a Firesale is active, instead of them. 

- Make sure to use the 'meat' on an enemy player

- Finally

**Cell Block UPDATE**

- The PaP'd starting pistol (M1911) + PhD Flopper (found next to the Olympia) is an insanely good combo. For those that don't know why

- Don't forget that when someone buys one of the spawn doors (for MotD) the other door opens too. The same works for Grief. So if someone is blocking the door in the spawn in or out

- A few tips here for the PaP area. 

Firstly, this prevents the enemy team to knife/push you off. Feel free to do it to them though :D

Secondly, they will kill themselves right in front of the machine. Why? Because this prevents you from picking up your weapon when it comes out of the machine. You just can't take it. There is no option to do so. All because the enemy is downed right infront of it. To be safe, wait until they are gone. If they won't leave. Just try your best to knife there away slightly, put it in and stay as close to the machine as possible.

Thirdly

- When feeding the dogs (or, immediately lay prone under the area the drop comes from. The enemy team can't knife you out of the way and steal it. 

- The fan trap: A great surprise weapon. It does have a slight start up time. So you'll have to time it right if you're trying to take down an enemy with it. To avoid the Fan Trap

- To avoid the Acid Trap....well....you can't. At least not when it comes to moving through it. When moving through the Acid Trap area, almost guaranteeing a death for the enemy.

- When it comes to Brutus

- Brutus is unaffected by traps, it's a waste of money. However, when an enemy is trying to escape Brutus, a trap can lockout a pathway, leaving the enemy team to stay where they are, unable to escape from him. There is always a chance though that Brutus will just immediately shut the trap off anyway, allowing the enemy team some space to breathe. It's a bit of a gamble.

- The Death Machine is actually a great investment in this. PaP it. It becomes an insanely good weapon. It's great for defending teammates, very long time (as you would expect). Since this is the type of map in which you're most likely to stay in one area, it gives an advantage to people who use this weapon. It's at it's best when your in a stationary position.

- Ray Gun + PhD Flopper. A great combo. No splash damage. Great for Brutus.

- PaP'd BlunderGat + Speed Cola. Another great combo. I've seen someone stand at the end of a walkway

**Will update for next map... If there is one...**



I will consistently update this post with tips/strategies that people have commented below:

- (LittleCucumber) When a player on the other team is down

- (wellllzy) When playing grief on farm camp near the mystery box after its opened up and wait for the opposing team to use the box. After they start spinning the box quickly knife them off the ledge and then run over to the top of the stairs and lay prone at an angle so they can't run back up there and retrieve their weapon. It's a pretty easy and dickhead-ish way to piss people off. The first couple hits at the box are somewhat crucial. If you can screw that up for a couple of the guys on the other team then your chances of winning are great!


- (I_am_sorrow) When an enemy is downed and the other team is prone reviving him dolphin dive on top of the guy reviving and it will kill him too. Just have your team pick you up.

- (randomjellybean) ""Cover your man"" strategy. If you have 4 organized players (can still be done solo). Cover your respective color on the opposite team and steal all the kills, go find the blue player on the enemy and put all your 'griefing' strategies against him.) 

- (rankketchup) Once you've gotten the GalvaKnuckles

1374851167.0,1j3m8u,I was a bit curious...,mshamba,64,12,18,"I don't often decide to play solo to give a shot at the higher rounds, and in the future

These are my summarized findings

* Round 20: 60 zombies spawn in.
* Round 25: 80 zombies.
* Round 30: 105 zombies. 99 spawned in on round 29.
* Round 35: 123 zombies. 
* Round 40: 168 zombies. 
* Round 45: 206 zombies. 198 spawned in on round 44. 
* Round 50: 249 zombies. 
* Round 53: 276 zombies. 

Unfortunately I ended the game in the middle of round 54 with 6000 kills because I was tired of playing for 5 hours. I did notice that in each successive round, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, ... , 47, knife my way into 2 nukes during insta-kills towards the end of round 36

As for the max ammo drops (recorded from round 30 onward), 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 49, 54. I noticed that you'd more likely get them towards the beginning of the round than the end. So you can expect a max ammo almost every round. 

Other experiences: From round 39 onward, it took 3 bursts from the PaP'd Ray Gun MKII to kill a zombie. You know how the MKII's bursts go through multiple zombies in the earlier rounds? Well the zombie on this round absorbed all the 'rays.' They didn't come out the zombie's back.  On round 51, a regular RPG from the mystery box would not kill a zombie. I fired all the rockets at a zombie's feet, and all it did was become a crawler that still had a ton of health. (I tested these for fun when I had the last few slow-walking zombies alive at the end of each round. I'll do more tests for fun next time).

2. M1911. What the fuck? How the hell does Treyarch expect us to empty **three** mags into some other player who sprints like all hell at us?

3. Kill-whore/Non-strategy teammates. Every time I play, nobody moves and watched me get anally fisted until the survivor gets the M1911, which they are thoroughly fucked unless it's insta-kill.

4. Small map. It seems there is **NOWHERE** to go

5. You glow neon orange? As soon as I spawn, and as afore-mentioned, thoroughly fuck you and there is nothing you can do about it. However, whenever I get killed as the human, I can **never** spot the orange glow until he kills someone.

6. You do everything slower. I try to throw a grenade because I can hear all three zombies waiting by the same spot

7. The knifing system. No words

8. You derank so goddamn fast because every time you get killed

9. As a zombie, front and center charging is a terrible idea.

Richtofen and Marlton (nerdy character) talk about using something to become unstoppable.Marlton talks about the electronic force in Nuketown, which ties in with the new characters.Richtofen and Marlton are both trying to get it to become unstoppable.Richtoffen might not be unstoppable yet even though he controls the zombies.

 That may be why Richtofen is now targeting them, maybe that was what he was studying and got banished. 

Also I think Richtofen created the Electrical Zombie and was an attempt at trying to get the electrical force.I﻿ think the tower of Babel is one of many towers which will stop the zombies when all activated at once

Also I have proof Richtofen created the Electrical Zombie.In Nuketown you can here a distorted voice say ""POWER"" and Richtofen says he should have created a robot instead.Also I think the electrical force is a gigantic EMP.Because if you use an EMP grenade on a zombie you see the blue in their﻿ eyes go away.The blue eyes show Richtofen controls zombies,False,self,t5_2sal9,1357183477.0,,,t3_15v6pd

If you have any tips/tricks to add

First of all, so I can setup the entire map and get everything I need before round 2.

I will run a few games in custom match (on easy) or solo to just simply stock points in the bank. 

Ok

When you start at the bus depot.
Kill every zombie EXCEPT 1 (a slow walker helps). Do not knife or shoot the last zombie

Build the turbine,000 points before they leave Bus Depot. The zombie as long as he is not wounded will follow you around the map indefinitely, re-spawning at new locations along the way. You can also get the zombie to latch onto the windows of bus at any point and rebuild windows as he tears it down. Done effectively he will never get in and you will get points and upgraded planks quickly.

After the Bus leaves Depot you will head to Diner. You don't really need anything here yet so just stay on bus and get ready to take the shortcut after you leave Diner. I wait until after the bus crosses the lava after Diner and count to 7 slowly. I then exit the bus and run behind it and across the road. The shortcut is right next to the church in-between a truck and a car. Follow that and you end up in town. This gives you enough time to open the bank

Once the bus arrives at town I usually have also purchased Semtex and checked room in Town for parts (you are looking for top of Diner/Bus part

Board Bus (bring zombie) head to Bus Depot. Unlock Bus depot door, buy Speed Cola, unlock garage and start hitting the box. I am looking for: EMP Grenades, HAMR, RPD, Ray Gun, Executioner, MTAR (maybe). I like to hit the box until it moves to next location

You should now be setup with: Juggernaut, Galvaknuckles and 2 guns you like.

Board bus and head to Farm.

At Farm I will buy the last useful Perk I need. I purchase Double Tap and open Shed with turbine and grab whatever part is there and Claymores. You can open House if you like

Board Bus

At Power I exit bus and very quickly setup the parts to turn power on and use turbine to exit power room after power has been turned on. Hopefully you have ladder for outside of Bus as well now

Arrive at Town

Kill Zombie

You now should have: All 4 Perks you like, The Entire map unlocked, Power on and ready to run a successful game of Tranzit or attack the Easter Egg by Round 2.

Thoughts?

SMR... Barrett... KAP-40...) need I go on? These weapons need to be more powerful than they currently are. 

- Box weapons need their accuracy fixed. The Type 25 and the SMR don't even seem to register to be ADSing when you actually ADS. It seems like you are always hip firing.

- Make the box more exciting! Add MORE LMGS

- Bring back the crossbow! Its better in this installment

- DON'T put the box so far out of the way! To get to it on Die Rise you can only take one specific path in order to initially gain access to it.

- Bring back the hacker as a buildable! You could hack the box to share weapons. This would especially be useful in BLOPS2

**Mic Etiquette** :If you have a mic great! Don't overuse it.  There is no need for your music or your conversation with people we cannot hear. The mute function works in zombies just as it does in multiplayer



**Easter Egg/Power** :If you want to do the Easter Egg discuss it in the lobby.  There are too many of us who have done it/ don't give a shit.  With this being said, **NEVER SHUT THE POWER OFF** it turns perks off and gets unsuspecting people killed...and again trolls do not make high rounds. 



**Loners** : Loners are excepted, don't be a dick.



**The Hatch** At high rounds the location of the hatch has minimal effect on the game.  Its a personal preference, not a big deal. 


**Zombie Train Location** : I can with a bit of ease train zombies at the Tunnel, I give it to them.  Ultimately it leads to higher rounds, which gives you a higher k/d.

&gt; Ok
I have my doubts

That is a great theory. So it would have to go in steps like this:

* Random ass zombie on Call of the Dead gets shot with the VR-11 and turns into business man with BO
* Turns out it's Stu and he gets beamed up
* Stays as human and eventually comes down to earth

1368216876.0,1e3818,No-Mic etiquette,djthylacine,51,16,29,"So I play a lot in the middle of the night when I'd prefer not to be talking loudly due to others in my household sleeping.  Therefore I usually never play with a mic unless it's my usual zombie killing crew.  I've been doing this since Black Ops 1 and I just wanted to give you a rundown of what I consider my etiquette to be for not using a mic.

**Pre Game Lobby**

* If I get into a lobby with any mics in it then I instantly leave.  When you are put into a lobby, which gives other players a couple extra seconds of seeing you before you see them.  Therefore 3/4 of the time I get into a lobby with one kid screaming 'GET A DAMN MIC WTF ARE YOU EVEN...' and by then I usually have left the lobby.  So a little courtesy request is give a no mic like 5 seconds before you start getting unnecessarily upset about it. People get so worked up so fast. 

* If I'm put into a match with 3 no mics and 1 mic then the 1 mic should either leave or accept it and play with all of us.  I've been in a lobby with one mic who sat and yelled for like 40 seconds straight at the entire lobby of no mics to leave.  Don't be that guy please 

* If it's a standoff of 2 mics vs 2 no mics

also split-screeners count as 2 mics to me if the main one has a mic plugged in. 

**In Match**

Most of the etiquette really just comes with the pre game lobby.  Once you are in a match then it's map specific etiquette and knowing to leave other peoples zombies alone.  I've found that non verbal communication is fairly easy just by knifing things or crouching on things a bunch. I try to always find players with blue eye'd skulls or knifes through the skull

Here's how you do it as quickly as possible.

* Round 1 starts
* Kill all zombies by shooting them in the leg 8 times and then Knife to maximize points. (to be honest I didn't really take my time with it... Sometimes I missed or just felt lazy and knifed them straight away...)
* Open up the General store
* Free Leroy.

---Now

* 
* **If The Alcohol Spawns back in his cell, and go through the tunnels leading to the Saloon. Get the Alcohol that spawns here. You also need to purchase the 750 points debris that blocks your way
* You need to get into the Juggernog corridor and line up Leroys back to the Armory. Make sure you take your time here. Give him the Alcohol.
* This should open up the Armory and give you around 2000 points. This makes it so you have super easy access to the Armory and will make getting this achievement a lot easier. **You get 2000 points because the longer Leroy has to run
* now you have to proceed to put the Chalk drawings on the Question Marks.

**In order**

1. On the building holding Leroys Cell.
2. Right on top of the stairs on the Room with the Turbine you built
3. On the Top floor of the Courthouse (the building where the Box is beside). **You can get here by using the Tramplesteam right outside the Building with the Turbine in it. Just place it down close to the edge and jump on it. You'll know you're in the right building if you see Speed Cola**
4. This one is on the roof of the Saloon. You can get here by taking the tunnel from the roof of the building that contains Leroy's Cell

* There's a couple things you have to do in the Saloon.

1. Purchase Alcohol for 1000 points.
2. Turn on the power by jumping across from the roof of the Saloon. **Make sure you don't forget to turn on the power... It's really frustrating when you get to the PaP machine and it says that You need to turn on the power first**

* After that
* Open up the Church by giving Leroy the Booze (also
* Use the Tramplesteam again to get over the Debris beside the Sweets shop and get 2 things.

1. The final Chalk drawing.
2. The B23R. (The weapon I personally used. I've tried the PDW

* Make your way back to the Second half of the map from the General Store
* Enter the Ghosty Bitches house. There's a set amount that spawn in

1. To your left as you go up the stairs.
2. Right after #1 from the room
3. There's one as the bookshelf opens up
4. One near the end of the Bookshelf tunnel
5. I think there's either one or two after #4. Just careful make your way to the end.
6. (or 7). One or more will follow you outside of the Mansion. Keep your guard up till you see a Perk Drop. That's how you know it's over.

* That's it :)! Hopefully you guys found this useful. If you have faster methods please let me know. I don't know of a faster one that this.

1373075527.0,1hq5ls,My take on the Zombies storyline in general...,clue3086,48,9,26,"Ok... lets start with Shi No Numa and Der Reise... in both, depending on what youre doing on your games, i.e. Richtofens Grand Scheme at one point and that he's not in ti to only survive. 

This is on Nacht Der Untoten i know

Next comes Kino Der Toten. We have made it to the future and see that time travel is possible. We get more story

In ascension, provided we havent just killed him flat out. We also get some minor story here. In Five, we dont get much but we learn the Americans have been working with 115 as the Winter's Howl and Thunder Gun are seen here. And not just in the box.

Next comes Call Of The Dead

From here is Shangri-la

After this we have Moon. Our finale for Blops1 and the O4 for now. Here, but it did set up Buried to be in the perfect position for a Scalene Triangle with all 3 EEs. We hear no more of the O4 after this except for mere hints.

Next after a long wait we have Tranzit. The Earth is in chaos and Richtofen/Maxis are having us set up a tower for some reason. The N4 show some questions towards the overlord they now hear and try to decide to help or not. 

From here, Stuhlinger begins hearing zombie snarls constantly. We get this tower and are rewarded. 

Next we have MOTD (yes ive skipped Nuketown completely. Sorry. Not muchthere) this map im saving for last. It is the key. After this: Buried. I cant say much on it though aside from this is IT. The decider of all. But we have the time bomb more freedom in things and more puzzles and a very unique EE along with ghosts. Theres a thing called Infinity Mode though in which we find our bodies and zombies are invincible.

What do almost all of our maps have in common? A time loop of sorts is mentioned or seen. The clock on Der Reise is going a few seconds and resets back and it is an atomic clock, time travel first thing, not much there aside from the portraits of our characters which is unusual. Next we have stopped clocks in 5 and Ascension.  After that, COTD, which not much there unfortunately. Then shangri-la we have a direct experience of a time loop. After this Moon, which is the transfer of power, some evidence of time travel here as well. In Tranzit, the intro shows a time loop exactly. In Buried

Now. Mob of the Dead. The map itself is a cycle of life and death. A time loop in itself in hell. We have another set of stopped clocks too. From this though

Heres my belief. The entirety of zombies from Shi No Numa and Nacht/Verruckt is one giant time loop the characters are stuck in. Hence why theres writing about the Aether in Shi No and Der Reise. Along with mentions by Tank of regaining memories that Richtofen was evil or something in Ascension upon PAPing. This is exactly the same as the 4 of MOTD slowly remembering things as they fight, perks, afterlife, etc. Back to the writing; everyones believing the final map is in the Aether, and if it is, or connects to it, that writing will insinuate that going through the Aether enables you to return to the start of the cycle. But the time we are playing now, is the time they break the cycle and we get the same decision; stop the zombies by repeating the cycle and trying again, skip ahead some.

End spoilers if you cared. Of course

TL;DR: Nazi Zombies storyline is one huge time loop.

Edit: Currently listening to the song Always Running finally with lyrics because I've needed to for a while... but in the lyrics, now that that's out of the way: we know Sherwoods songs have always had a deep meaning in correlation to the story itself... but here Malukah sings the above mentioned lines. in the start of zombies, we found ourselves in Shi No Numa, no idea how we got there, as everything was boarded up, no idea who we really were, and no idea what went on here, but this was worse as we had characters with personalities and more wall writings/radios, but did we not have the monkey Bomb in Der Reise to lure the zombies away from us? basically the only hopes of salvation, sort of the Lucifer in the storyline if i may say. but nevertheless

1 - It would have six characters, ISA, SDC, Militia, Mercs).

2 - The point system would be different. There would be two point systems: the normal one

3 - There would be a ""Scorestreak machine"" that would cost 1000 points to use, RC-XD, Hunter Killer, Care Package, Counter-UAV, Guardian, Hellstorm Missile), Sentry Gun, Orbital VSAT) and the third high-end ones (Escort Drone, VTOL Warship

4 - Each zombie kill would award the player with 10 points towards the Scorestreaks. If it's a headshot kill

5 - Scorestreaks would work as following:

* UAV (425 Points) - Show all zombies and allies on the mini-map. Lasts 28 seconds
* RC-XD (450 Points) - Works exactly like the Multiplayer counterpart. However, if the player times it and detonates it before it hits something, it will do a massive 30,000 damage that is doubled every 10 rounds after Round 40. It is much faster than its multiplayer counterpart and has a smaller blast radius. Players are invisible to zombies while using it.
* Hunter Killer (525 Points) - Works exactly like its MP counterpart. Deals 7
* Counter-UAV  (550 Points) - Disorients all zombies on the map

* Guardian (600 Points) - Disorients all zombies caught on its ultrassonic wave (different of the microwaves on MP). Zombies will slow down and reach to their ears in pain. Any zombie that stays on the Guardian's radius for more than ten seconds die

* Care Package (650 Points) - Same as Multiplayer

* Hellstorm Missile (700 Points) - Deals infinite damage if it isn't deployed. When deployed

* Lightning Strike (750 Points) - Each bomb deals infinite damage with a 30% smaller blast radius. However

* Sentry Gun (800 Points) - Mows down any zombie on its sights. Works exactly like the automatic turret on Kino Der Toten. Lasts for 90 seconds before turning off. If the player reaches 800 Score again, destroying the old one on the process.

* Dragonfire (850 Points) - Unlike the MP counterpart

* AGR (900 Points) - Behaves much like the MP counterpart. However, it will use its missiles, and on a large one, it will fire both at the same time. It is a bit slower, and attracts zombies on a 100 ft. radius. Zombies can destroy it (blows up after taking 10 slaps from the zombies).

* Chopper (1000 Points) - Mows down zombies it sees. Will attract zombies to its victiny

* Orbital VSAT (1100 Points) - Shows all zombies, Mistery Box (orange trace), perks (dot with the color corresponding to the perk), and Scorestreak Machine locations on the mini-map.

* Escort Drone (1250 Points) - Same as its MP counterpart. Leaves after 45 seconds. 

* EMP Systems (1300 Points) - Freezes all zombies for 20 seconds. Their eyes stop glowing

* Warthog (1400 Points) - Same as MP counterpart.

* Lodestar (1500 Points)  - Launches insta-kill missiles. Player is invisible to all zombies while using it. Leaves after 40 seconds or after 10 rockets have been launched. Player keeps invisible to all zombies after five seconds of stopping controlling it.

* VTOL Warship (1600 Points) - Also AI-controlled. Will change its location depending of how many zombies are on its vicinity. Leaves after 40 seconds.

* K9 Unit (1700 Points) - Dogs that insta-kill zombies they bite. They have the same health as a normal player without Jugg. 16 dogs can be deployed

* Swarm (2000 Points) - Very rare. Pretty self-explanatory - multiple Hunter Killer drones that do double damage of the normal HK drone.

6 - Perk machines are modernized. Every map has Juggernog, and Speed Cola. The other machines are randomized, depending of the map. Each map has seven perk machines.

7 - Players can buy attachments to their guns. The attachments are on chalk drawings on the walls. Buying one will put it on the current weapon you're holding (unless it is not compatible). Maximum of 2 attachments for each gun. Attachments cost between 300 and 800 points

8 - Pack-a-Punching a weapon would make it get a Cyborg Camouflage with the color depending of your character's faction (Red for SDC, orange for Mercs and green for ISA). Doing the Pack-a-Punch will allow the weapon to receive one extra attachment slot, being able to have three attachments. Only modern weapons and some Wonder Weapons can be found within the game - however, all MP weapons are at disposal, be it on walls, or on the Mystery Box. Players start with a modernized version of the M1911.

9 - Each faction character has two abilities.

* FBI gets 15% discount on their Scorestreak rewards and 10% less recoil on all guns.
* Seals flinch less when hit and their weapons have a 10% faster fire rate and reload time.
* ISA gets 40% less idle sway on all weapons and can't be heard by the zombies (zombies can hear footsteps
* SDC gets higher melee range and 10% more damage on all bullet-firing weapons.
* Militia can carry an extra grenade on both slots and deal 15% more explosive damage.
* Mercs get a 10% discount on all machines (perk

10 - There could be some explanation on how these operatives went on the Zombie world and must find a way to get out of that. Each map would have its objectives, and the players respawn on their respective spawn points with their weapons, receiving all perks on the map for the remainder of the game.

1366825705.0,1d0u5c,Mob of the Dead Thoughts.,Geo_Music,46,7,48,"Mob of the Dead is seemingly well received by the community and in my opinion MOTD is exceptional. Much has been written about the added weaponry

1. Leaked Info: One of the things that strikes me as unusual as opposed to the other zombie DLC's (Die rise, deadshot, warden boss, PAP on bridge, flying to the golden gate bridge, electric chairs, afterlife mode) etc. Die Rise had many iterations of fake loading screens and bad information...I wonder why this was the case for Mob of the Dead. Hopefully Treyarch can do a better job preventing leaks in the future (although many would disagree with me). 

2. Missed Surival Maps Opportunity: Mob of the Dead would have provided for some amazing survival maps ( Docks

3. Voice Acting: Chaz Palminteri did the best job of all the voice actors. Overall so much better than the Tranzit characters and bad ass in general. 

4. Solo Mode : Although I enjoy co op much more one of the things I found annoying about Solo previously is the max of 3 revives for a full game. Afterlife adds a very interesting element to playing solo as losing the game is no longer just three downs total. 

5. Zombie Theme: MOTD took so many elements from throughout the zombies lineage that gives it so much depth. ""Fetch me their souls"" with the three hellhound heads. Using the avogadro mechanics for an afterlife mode. Coffins as opposed to a mystery box. 

6. Future Changes: Mob of the Dead also makes me very curious about the next DLC. The graphics in MOTD are very different as well as the heads up display. I am very curious to see if many of the changes implemented in MOTD carry over into further DLC's. 

7. Perks in the future: One of the things Treyarch did at the end of BLOPS1 was to add Mule Kick to all of the previous maps. With Flopper and Mule Kick being available in Grief but both perks being shown off the docks in MOTD....I wonder if Treyarch will add these perks back to MOTD at the end of the DLC season. 

8. Ending Song: When Die Rise came out people were speculating on what the noise was when you finally lost. After Mob of the Dead came out the losing noise at the end of Die Rise is the same noise as when the Warden spawns. At the end of MOTD there is a very futuristic sounding song. The loading screen did not show any hints or tears so the end song / noises seems to be the new next DLC tease?

In Shi No Numa that guy on the radio says The Giant must be contained at all costs. Everybody assumed he meant Der Riese ( Der Riese means The Giant). Now that we have a ""Giant""

So here's what I think. In WW1 German scientists engineered The Giant. They meant it to be a super soldier. The Giant somehow gets lost or into the wrong hands or something. Fast forward to WW2 now. German scientists have made a facility named 'Der Riese' (the giant) where try to make super soldiers using element 115 after their beloved Giant, and manage to learn the difference of The Giant and Der Riese. They believe the Germans still have the Giant somewhere and send agents to spy and learn intel about the Giant. One agent (Peter) goes to Shi No Numa and gets a radio transmission from another one (lets call him Bob). Bob learns just how dangerous the Germans could become once they find or fix or whatever the Giant and get it back in their hands. He warns Peter that it must be contained at all costs because it could potentially win the war for the Germans.

I went to the roof and was doing well with the Spork when I think my buddy Ray got me down.  I went to the tape and after fast forwarding 3 hrs of footage I realized this epic round didn't make the cut.  WTF.  Anyway my epic tale didn't end there.  With no perks or shield I was on the roof with the Voice


Plan A Get Jug.  I decided I needed all zombies behind me so I only killed those that I needed to and horded the rest up behind me.  From there I used the voice to get through the infirmary.  Noticing the Voice takes 2 hits to kill


With Jug in place I went for a shield and figured the acid trap would speed things up.  Not the case.  The Shield did add comfort and possibly a little too much confidence.

Plan C Speed Cola.  This is where my confidence was too high.  I turned on the fan trap and bought Speed only to turn around and notice that an entire swarm of zombies had spawned in the Warden's den.  The voice got me to the trap and my army crawl got me out while my 3 spectators assumed I was good as dead.  I really wanted to see how the entire swarm spawned in that fast; theatre mode where are you?


With death dodged I grabbed the new Cherry perk and headed to the docks to spawn my team by jugs and Tommy.  Using the sniper tower I noticed the docks were not a safe place for the last man of a 4 player game.  I used the acid shower a couple more times and went back to the roof.  Using up just about all of the Weasel's ammo.


With 4 crawlers and 3 slow walkers I fueled up the plane and asked the team what they wanted.  They wanted me to replace my guns in the box and PaP.  I didn't want to fight Brutus now so I suggested completed the EE and calling it a night.  


The Weasel has his revenge.  Against 3 inmates armed with M1911s and no perks I was ready to break the cycle.  Ray's Porter did nothing to my first victim so it was down to the low ammo Voice to end the game.  Why is there no cut scene when you finish the EE?  I understand when the Weasel dies the cycle continues but when I finally won one I hoped for something.

Note: Before I start this I'd like to say I'm doing all of this on an iPod so if there are spelling/grammar mistakes or weird formatting I'm sorry.

  With the new zombies map just released I feel like we all need to be on the same page with everything and see where we're going in terms of zombies. First we should look at the previous maps in BO2 and how they will relate in the future.

  Tranzit and Die Rise are probably my least favorite zombies maps. For me they have very little replay ability. They don't have a really and dark tones that BO1 provided us with. Map designs were not only linear but provided no room for back tracking(you could sometimes but it would be tedious). The story really didn't provide us with much except for us to activate these Towers for Maxis or Richtofen. It was a bit of a let down. 

  Then came Mob of the Dead. A map that returns to Nazi Zombies roots with its extremely dark tones we see(PlayTheGame has a really good video going through all examples of this in the map). It's layout is much more open than the previous maps

  Finally

  Above all

  My personal theory is that the new crew will start out at ""The Rift"" in the next map and travel to Argatha to either find Samantha and stop Maxis or help Richtofen in his grand scheme. 

 Regardless

I thought to myself that this was going to be a good game as we were all decent players

Things were going smoothly up until round ~15. I decided to upgrade my Galil when a sudden EMP grenade cockblocked my upgrade. I looked up to the bar and I seen the Shotgun rank player looking down at me

I was fairly pissed but I had a good bit of points and a ray gun so I was alright.

But there's more.

He did this 2 more times to the other players and I was getting even more infuriated. 

Then at round 18 he turned off the Jugg and Tombstone perks. One of the players had died the last round and was therefore unable to recover his tombstone and ended up rage quitting.

Finally at round 20 he got to me again.

It was just me and him left as our other teammate just got downed and we were upstairs in the bar.

I was busy shooting the zombies and he was doing absolutely nothing

I eventually ran out of ammo

He was not finished just yet.

He kept a crawler and literally WALKED around town. This went on for ~15 minutes. He then just left the game.

The map starts out like you would guess 
New though is that you can actually choose your character.
In the ''after life''.
The after life is a cool feauture which is needed for simple puzzles for getting plane parts
It isn't overpowered as you only get one every round.



And Hey 
It looks like it came straight from hell.
The maps itself is small corridors and some open area's 
(And a real good camping place at the docks.)
The perks are great and there is again a tease at PHD flopper.

But all he still really wants is to perform scientific experiments. As shown by his dialogue about playthings. It just seems like Richtofen wants to science and interact with the universe. This just becomes more convenient by the fact that he somewhat becomes a god. Maxis wants to become god to destroy the world and be with Samantha. Clearly, you* can* get to Agartha without destroying the world, because Richtofen sent the O4 there, and says he's gonna do it again when his Easter Egg is completed.

Pros!
1. It has the m16
2. The m16 has the highest damage out of all the wall weapons
3. It is an assault rifle
4. The pack a punched version has a noob tube attachment which is excellent for insta kill (and should only be used then). Because its huuuuge blast radius takes out your whole crowd in one hit (with insta kill). This means amazing ammo conservation.
5. Big place to run
6. Potentially infinite ammo if you don't miss all the time (pack a punched)
Cons!
1. Very secluded. You won't be able to help your teammates if they go down. (Only an issue in multiplayer of course)
2. The bus can kind of be interruptive but it's very easy to work around it
3. The weapon placement is kind of sketchy because the platform is a little skinny and you could potentially get trapped. Just play it smart. Wait till you have a crowd then go so none spawn in front of you.

I was playing town survival with 2 randoms, and I had revived them both a number of times, so it got to the point where they were useless, and had no points to spend on weapons or perks. During round 17 they both planned to trap me upstairs in the bar so that the game ends. They were successful. So I sent them a message to switch to game chat, so we could play again. They assumed I didn't know they were trolling. I was a bit upset that they found fun in being stupid. This time though, they said they'd play seriously. And they did. I let them get almost all the kills. All I did was run around with jug and stamin-up, letting them do the killing. They felt real good. By round 14, with their tombstones ready. My time came: to waste their time like they did mine. I purposely killed myself and the game ended. The tone in their voices was golden. Sheer disappointment. My job was done

The answer

Richtofen, the current events make a victory improbable. Or, perhaps in Richtofens case, he realizes his one insanity. 

In a final, telling him what he must do. 
Said entity tell the young original crew that in order to truly find redemption

They must fight their way through the bunker at Nacht der Unto ten and save the Marines. 

They must travel back to Verrukt and save Dempsey (Version 1

They must go to Shi no Numa and rescue Peter. 

They must travel back to Der Riese and uncover the truth of the giant. 

They must discover the truth about the Theater of the DAMNED. 

They must go to Ascension and free Gersch and the souls of the Russian research team. 

They must travel into the mystical place of Shangri-la and unravel the ways of time. 

They must go onto the Moon and remove Richtofen from having a chance to take his power. 

And then. 

They must destroy the final

The giant.

What we do know is that we could possibly be seeing the return of the original 4, Paris, agartha etc. The rumour that got me interested the most was The Dark Side of the Moon, because if you think about it, the original four must need to get off the moon some how, and this is where the ""Reverse No-Man's Land"" comes into play.

As most of us know, and can also be referred to as round 0. Infinite zombie spawn, and your only way of escape is through the teleporter. The idea that I had is exactly the same thing, except, instead of trying to escape area 51, you are trying to escape the moon.

This is why it is reversed: You are doing the same thing

This could actually take place on the exact teleporter spot as seen in the moon map

Although the telporter links to the telporter in Area 51, or maybe even an accident (Der Riese - Kino Der Toten. I am sure that Richtofen did not mean to send the crew THAT FAR into the future: The Wunderwaffe overloaded the teleporter.)

However

As a side note, they would put PhD flopper where mule kick is. This would be a troll, as you would have to gather the points for it, buy it then leave. If you get downed, then that's it. You've lost it; as there is no way of getting it back.

Here are some location ideas I had in mind:

**TranZit** - Upper floor of the small house at the Farm (Where jugg is on Farm Survival) 

**Bus Depot** - Where quick revive would be located on TranZit (if they were to add it in Bus Depot)

**Town** - Semtex room; across from Double Tap II/Box Location

**Farm** - Bottom floor inside the Barn

**Nuketown** - Self explanatory (one of the perk/PaP spawns)

**Die Rise** - In the Buddha room

**Mob of the Dead** - where it is located in Cell Block Grief

**Cell Block** - Already in Cell Block (located in the library

**Buried** - Maybe in the Barn right when you drop down from Quick Revive

**Borough** - Same as Buried


Again just an idea

And ya I realize that maybe to some people the perk isn't as useful as everyone makes it out to be. I personally enjoy it and think it would be pretty neat for Treyarch to do this.

(Requirements) 
*Have over 6k in the bank (you got to spend money to make money) *Keep a PaPed weapon in the fridge.

(Steps)
Spawn in the starting room and attempt to make about 1, and withdraw your 6k. Open up the power room, power up, and ride the elevator to the roof. Once you are on the roof, jump over to the Bz3r/Trample steam crafting room. Jump down onto the pink mattresses in the next building over. Go down the elevator shaft and buy the Galvanuckles.
Now you are on round 1 with a pack a punched gun and the Galvanuckles. Reimbursing yourself for your initial Galvanuckles purchase should be incredibly easy. Now just train/camp wherever you want

**Further Explanation**

(Setting up the game)

You should probably set this strategy up in multiple games.
The set-up game should focus on pack-a-punching your gun. I would recommend pack-a-punching the AK74u because its close to the fridge, and its up to you whether you want to continue the game, or end the round and head into the real money making phase.

(Start making the money)

So follow the steps mentioned in the simple explanation above. Now I would recommend camping the area near the dragon
If you want to train Buddha room

1371933664.0,1gvg0w,My thoughts on Black Ops 2 Zombies so far,WhiteTreeOfGondor,37,14,27,"**Tranzit**
Tranzit more or less met the requirements of a basic zombies map, which is fine. It was what it was, *Green Run* was a nice introduction to zombies for those who didn't play previous games, and had a similar but intriguing environment for veterans.  

**Let me be clear; I enjoyed Tranzit

I did not like the fact that Black Ops 2 featured *only* tranzit as a major game mode. Even with the addition of Nuketown, the game lacks variety. Grief and survival take place within the world of green run, and frankly I didn't like it. 


**Die Rise** 
Die Rise was a great map, train on the roof, not to mention  the free perk system. The only downside was *whose-who*, a terrible perk in my opinion, at least for that map. It may have been more suitable in previous maps, like on BO1. Kino would be awesome to have whose-who on, but Die Rise just doesn't suit it. 

Anyway, but hey we all had fun (for the most part). Perma perks were back, which was cool. A little annoyed that there was no Der Reise reference or anything....


**Mob of the Dead** 
Mob of the Dead was the **coolest f**king* map. It introduced an entirely new set of characters, weapons, motives, and features in general. An entirely new map, very refreshing. And the newness starts just as you begin, in the *afterlife* which had never been in any map before. The afterlife was also the method of powering perks, instead of just flipping a lever. Brutus was a homage to George and COTD, but again, but who cares

I guess individually I like each map a lot, and then they added cool stuff... I wish BLOPS2 had more maps to begin with, even if they were unrelated to the story. I feel like Treyarch sold out on us, but are using the money to make a good game.

1371487994.0,1giwhu,[Long Theory] The Unusual Suspect is in control.,ljstreet,32,6,13,"I'll get back to the title later on but let's look at things like this. Call of the Dead presented an alternative future in our current zombies timeline. In that future, so why would we need to do Easter eggs to help him? Whatever we're building is a time machine. 



We've had some time travel previously but this will be on a larger scale. Something that can teleport to any time period with large groups of people or even buildings themselves. Richtofen and Maxis both know this because Nacht Der Untoten was teleported from Germany to Green Run but they both want it to gain control of the zombies. This also might explain why it is called ""The Prototype.""



But wait, for now. What if he somehow loses control and he knows he's going to so he has a massive time machine built for some reason to prevent it. Maxis also knows this, and is planning to do the same but this time finally be in control of his zombie army. 



How would Richtofen lose control though? Remember



What? Where did that come from? Yes Nikolai. Richtofen misses him and never had a problem with him. He even speaks to him as if he is a child and he would figure Nikolai would be too drunk to cause any real havoc with the zombies. He gives him some control but Nikolai is smarter than he appears and betrays Richtofen



So Nikolai is Brutus? In Mob of the Dead, the characters have more knowledge of what is occurring and that they are dead. But while they are alive, Nikolai is in control and Weasel hints towards this with his quote about Nikolai. When the cycle continues, they all die, realizing Nikolai is in control where they overthrow his control. When the cycle is broken, Weasel still lives. For some reason Nikolai needs Weasel to live and that is the reason the zombies do not attack Weasel during the Easter egg. Brutus' was created by Nikolai to prevent the crew from succeeding. This is why he locks the perks, the box ect. Knowing that the Bridge is where the rift in time is supposed to occur Nikolai spawns in more Brutuses to insure that they fail. Richtofen is the reason the perks are on the map as well as the box



But there's no way this all could happen? This may have been planned all along. One of the best ways to deceive people is to have a decoy. The decoy is Russman. The DLC names might spell F.E.A.R. R.U.S.S leading people to believe it means Russman, if Nikolai, a stereotypical Russian, during the rise of Communism were in control of zombies, what color would their eyes be?

The easter egg can be done by following these steps:


* Find all the parts to the Guillotine and build it
* Charge up all four red orbs with the paralyzer
* Knock down the floating purple lantern with a frag
* Charge up the lantern by killing ghosts
* Place the lantern on top of the rooftop
* Decipher the code using a tic-tac toe cipher
* Place a time bomb on the guillotine
* Galvaknuckle the signs in the correct order
* Run and touch the blue orb of energy (wish) that pops out of the sign. You need to keep touching it until it appears at the guillotine and before it disappears.
* Kill zombies near the guillotine. Capture 5 souls.
* After doing so
* You will then be sent to infinity mode and **must find some kind of switch**. We are stuck here. Zombies are invincible but can be killed with buildables.
* You can return to infinite mode by getting a Max Ammo and placing and using a new time bomb on the guillotine.

UPDATE: 10:54 (PST) -

* We found the bodies of our characters in infinity mode. You need to search them and eventually find a switch
* You can then add the switch to the guillotine
* Levers are then added to the doors in the maze
* We are currently trying to find the order.


~~So far

~~- Paralyzing the switch in the witch's house~~

~~- to touch/galvaknuckle/hold X on the switch in the witch's house~~

~~- to hit the power switch~~

~~- to hit the bells scattered around the map~~

~~- Looking around the map for a lantern~~

~~- to get the witch to play the piano~~

~~- to re-activate the signs to get another wisp~~

~~- hitting the dartboard~~

~~- taking the portal back to spawn~~

~~- using Huck to kill zombies near the guillotine~~

~~(We will continue to update as we continue our attempts. As of 6:26 PST

~~All of this to no avail. Any hints or suggestions?~~

Bus Depot:

Obviously this one I don't wanna touch too much because its supposed to be hard and basic. Only thing I would do is open up the doors that you use the turbine on in TranZit, and it'll be even more difficult if it moves in there.

Diner(Should it be made into a standalone survival):

Again, as well as one in the garage, turbine shed, speed cola where it always is, then one just up against a car somewhere or on the roof.

Mystery box spawns- fit one in diner? And the default spot.  

Wall weapons- mp5, on the column holding up the now die sign, move galvas to the little electric box on the roof across from where it is now.

Farm:

Open the fence and put PaP out there, whatever, if you wanna keep the ""No PaP"" thing on farm. 

More wall weapons if we're not gonna get PaP. Another on each barn floor

Town:

Oh my god this one could be so much. My ideas are kinda gonna trounce the ""Few Wall Weps on Town"" thing but oh well.

Areas: Okay so open the PaP in TranZit area up. Maybe make the two doors buyable instead of blow up. (Again, which would you all prefer?) 

Wall weapon ideas: Remington, claymores, AK74u. Wall spots: in the back area between PaP in the bar, in the PaP vault, in the back Safety Deposit Box area between the vault and the Bank itself, in the bank. 

Move PaP to its usual spot in TranZit and move jug to the middle to keep the whole ""really valuable thing in the huge lava pit"" thing. Put a box spawn where jugg was just to add variety.

* Hell's Redeemer (the upgraded Hell's Retriever)
* Pop Goes The Weasel
* The bottle song (Secret song #1)
* The lockbox song (Secret song #2)

* ""Hell's Bells"" (Sal's ""Route"")
* An unknown Billy-related Easter Egg

It should be common knowledge at this point that PlayTheGame not only got insider information (which is probably the only reason they know about these Easter Eggs)

What I wish was public knowledge is that PlayTheGame is talking out of their collective asses on some of the stuff they're claiming as ""secret"". I fully think PlayTheGame is bullshitting at this point for exposure. If you watch one of their latest videos which contains allegedly not-yet-heard-ingame quotes from the characters, and even NextGenTactics (NGTZombies) beat them to posting them, and they did it without the PC version to extract files from.

Back to the actual alleged easter eggs, INCOMPLETE, and Treyarch even patched out part of one of them. Now why is Hell's Bells nicknamed ""Sal's Route""? Because (again, according to PTG) there were supposed to be four different routes through Mob of the Dead: one for Weasel, one for Sal, one for Billy, and one for Finn, only Weasel's remained fully intact. Hell's Bells was to be one step of Sal's route

Russman is crazy and probably joined Stu in the eating of the zombie flesh. There are two ways Marlton could have gotten 115 in him. The first way is that he was a scientist working with 115 and he got it in him while working with it. The other way is that while in the Nuketown bunker he ran out of food and was forced to eat zombie meat. I'm assuming Misty sexually contracted it from Marlton.

Gonna give you guys a quick synopsis of the map. 

When you select the map on the globe, Village, Nuclear Plant and Jailhouse. I'll describe a game on Die Rise since it includes all of the areas.
 
In Die Rise, one with the M14 and the other with the Olympia. Zombies will come out of the fog and attack you. You can step foot into the fog, but you will be attacked by Denizens. This hill is basically the central hub of the map, all of the areas are located around it. The bus in this map has been replaced with a wagon ride, once again piloted by T.E.D.D. except this time wearing a farmer's outfit. The wagon will come by the hill at round 5 (I think) and if you get onboard he will take you to one of the 4 areas that make up the map. The wagon travels along dirt trails that run through the field. (the field is very big by the way and I've already found some secrets in it, such as a crashed fighter jet)
 
So to keep things simple I will describe one area at a time.
 
**CITY** 

The title is self-explanatory, and a few other things. The roof area is where the PaP can be found. You can navigate the different floors with the elevator. There are 5 or so different floors including the roof area. There is also an unfinished building in the city which was obviously under construction when the apocalypse occured. In there you can build the Headlamp using a hardhat and a flashlight. Wearing it lets you see your way through the fog easier and makes you immune to Denizens when you have it switched on. I think it also causes more zombies to come after you but I can't say for sure. There are also a few small buildings that don't need to be opened which have weapons in them. Last but not least there is a small park area, which is where you'll find another box location and Double Tap Root Beer. Something interesting here is a toppled statue of Adolf Hitler.
 
**VILLAGE** 

This area is a simple rural village, a few houses and some farmland. Nothing too important here except a box location, Juggernog and Deadshot. This place seems to be the best for running trains.
 
**NUCLEAR PLANT** 

As you might guess, and the power switch itself, which thankfully doesn't need to be built. There is also an under-construction atom bomb in the center of the facility.
 
**RAILROAD STATION** 
This is a small train station. It consists of a building, and the Galvaknuckles (in the train itself).
 
So yeah, as that'll probably get me IP-banned. Not to mention I have nothing decent to record it with.
 
Hope you enjoyed reading

So if I get this straight there is a Playstation Magazine UK that gives Zombie tips and on their last page they say:

""There is a narrative in Tranzit

So what this is saying is that you somehow can ""survive""? My first thought was that they were just probably talking about the EE but it says that you are supposed to listen to the 4 Tranzit characters.

From what I have heard they don't talk about anything that could lead to something.

But what do you guys think about this?

Here's the transcript:

George Barkley:

&gt;attention all on this channel. This is George Barkley,_Georgia)


&gt;prior to the destruction of our headquarters

&gt;symptoms are variable, [delusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion), and [paranoia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia). Short-term memory loss has also been reported, but as of yet, we've been unable to confirm this. 

&gt;Be advised to all individuals to monitor their fellow survivors for the above symptoms

&gt;I hope this message serves as a warning to all survivors; we must all do whatever it takes to ensure our survival as a species. Thank you.

Woman:

&gt;If there's anyone out there, and I *need* help. [breath] I tried to do it, to do it right, but the others, they wouldn't listen. This piece goes here, **this piece goes there**, I couldn't do it on my own. [crying] I need help, the German man stopped talking to me and I don't know what to do... [crying] what do do. 

The Flesh guy:

&gt;Science has failed us. *He*

&gt;[partial zombie voice

&gt;Heed our words, *and* we are the dead. We are The Flesh, and The Flesh, is us. We will not starve. We will thrive.

Saber One-Zero (military Op?):

&gt;Red-Con Five

&gt;That's a negative

&gt;Sir

&gt;Understood

Survivor:

&gt;To anyone listening: We have food

First off, not just Stuhlinger. Well, we already notice that Stu is paranoid, and is a conspiracy theorist, which shows that he is definitely contaminated. Also, Barkley says that he killed 14 of his team because they were infected, and they were plotting to kill him. Not very relevant

Next, or possibly an easter egg. She also says that the German man stopped talking to her. This could be Richtofen, or Maxis. I'm not sure if Maxis is German, but I'm pretty sure he is. This means that one of them is talking to her, possibly trying to get her and her group to do a similar task/the same task our group is doing, but her group left her, and now she's alone. She could very well be a character in future maps. Also, that means that she's probably also consumed zombie flesh

After that is a person from The Flesh, and thus the zombies won't attack them. It sounds like there's a possibility that Stu and the woman from the last audio clip were in The Flesh at one point, but left. We also hear a zombie voice asking for help, probably meaning that eating zombie flesh doesn't turn out too well, and that guy is turning into a zombie. Maybe a reason why Stu and new girl left The Flesh. 

Okay, but it looks like they're looking for survivors, but we have no idea what Broken Air is, who ""Stab"" is, what his connection to the zombie outbreak is, and what is being dropped. We can tell that Stab probably had something to do with the zombies, or else he wouldn't be destroying evidence about himself. Also, rather than one person.

Then the survivor. Not much there, just showing off that there are other survivors, that aren't necessarily in as bad a situation as our group is.

Should of at least had more options if not more maps to be played on.

- The bus depot!!

Go outside with a turbine and place the turbine on the furthest LEFT side of the outside door.

If done correctly you shouldve only opened 1 of the double doors.

Now you have a hold out room with 0 windows and only 1 point of entry!!!

If things get to hairy you can always lay down another turbine to the other door and get out of dodge!!

- The farm

The same thing applies to the farm

Go up to the barn

place the turbine on the LEFT side of the barn door

You should only have the front barn door open(and the back window)

the side barn door should be closed

Now you only have 2 points of entry

the window at the back and the front door of the barn

also again if things get to hairy place a turbine by the side barn door and get out!!

- Power station(this one is the hardest having no perks)

go down into the white power room and make sure the power is OFF.  Know that having the power OFF means that even if you have perks they will not be useable.

Go into the room with the power switch

you now have 2 points of entry

the front door and the side window

the metal rolling door should be closed as you have the power off

again if things get too hairy

- The town(2 possible)

probably the easiest of them all is above the bar

you have 2(3) points of entry

the window to the left

if things get bad just run out the back of the building ;)

(Second location

Go to where you open the single door to look for the bus part

place a turbine down and enter the room

you now have 1 point of entry

bunker down and make sure you have ammo and ray guns and monkeys :P

like i said this is a super safe place

Theres a few more spots that could be considered ""Hold out"" locations but i thought these were some of the lesser known. :P

What if pushing that button is our vote for which side's easter egg we want canon? Treyarch would look at which choice we made, then the next's map dlc would focus on stopping Richtophen.

This also lines up with what Vonderhaar said [here](http://imgur.com/q3dmZyW). We will ultimately decide the New Crew's fate forever with our vote. It's an ""unorthodox"" idea because this is the first (and probably last) time we choose what happens to our heroes.

1366117902.0,1cgipq,No One Get Out Alive Achievement Guide (SPOILER),Deca03,26,5,31,"This is a lot easier than you'd think. All you have to do is build the plane. It doesn't involve the blundergat or hell's retriever or anything. I'm not sure on where every place is called but I'll do my best to describe it. This can be done with any number of players. I did it solo.

Steps:

1. Get the warden's key. The key is hanging from an electrified pole in the prisons(where all the cells are). Just look around and you'll find it. There are a couple different spots but I'm pretty sure they're all by the cells. To get the key you have to enter the afterlife and find a spot you can jump in close to the key. You will overload the box that is electrifying the key and then you can grab it.

2. Get the plane parts. Once you have the wardens key you can access all the spots where the parts are. The shirt is in the laundry room, I forget what that part is called). Those three are very easy, you just use the wardens key. 
The next two require a little more work though. The one one the elevator requires you to go to the afterlife and travel to the bottom of the elevator. On the way down you'll see three numbers(they're very easy to see so I won't explain where). Enter these number into the combination at the the bottom. Go revive your self and then run to the very bottom of the elevator(Down the stairs from where the combination thing is). The part is sitting there now. 
The last piece is the engine. This is in the warden's office. You have to de-electrify the fence before you can unlock it though. To do this go buy the gate/door that costs 1500(not the 2000 door that goes to the docks). Go into the afterlife and overload the three machines. Two of them are in the room you are in. The last machine is in a room only accessible in the afterlife. Look around and you'll see it. After this go unlock the door and grab the engine.

3. Getting on the roof. Go to the area above the cafeteria. Get into the afterlife and find the hole in the wall(this hole is in the hallway before the room with the dog spot). You can open the door from that side. Go revive yourself and get on the roof!

4. If you have all the parts go to the spot to build and and hold x. Afterwards get on the plane and get the achievement!

I'm sorry for how vague this is. I'm in a rush to type this and I have only played a couple games so far. If you need me to elaborate more on any of the parts just leave a comment and I'll try to respond as quickly as I can. Thanks!

1359786993.0,17qrss,The Abomination part 2,Warrior2014,26,4,9,"So I was pondering the theory about the giant that keeps coming up when I had the idea of looking at the zombie timeline. When I got to the point close to the beginning of zombies, ability to use various classes of weapons, who died from the testing. I realized that these people were working with stuff to reanimate people
1359665548.0,17nfsr,Die Rise - First several steps towards the High Maintenance achievement. (Spoilers),dirty1391,29,6,13,"Alright

Start the game

There are 4 elevators that have gold medallions on the top of them. All 4 players are required for this. Without being crushed or killed by zombies, or just stand on them. If done correctly, they will begin to glow.

Now you must find the other 4 similar medallions on the floor just outside of the elevators. Stand away from the medallion

Now is the part where the SVU comes in. Take it to an area where you can see both of the dragons that are on the opposite roof from the main spawn. Aim at the mouths and you will see black orbs inside of them. Shoot them one at a time

The orbs will then transport to the lion statues that can be found on both sides of the double doors at the main spawn point.

This is where the split in the story line will occur. If you are a fan of Maxis, Maxis will command you to give a blood sacrifice, which basically means to kill zombies in that room. I would suggest using all 4 people so that it can be accomplished quicker. When you do this correctly, Maxis will say that you have given enough blood.

If you prefer to follow Richtofen, and return back to the statues that have the orbs. You then shoot the orbs with the sliquifiers until they are spinning. This will be a trial and error ordeal. 

This is as far as I have gotten, or with the Who's Who perk.

1356013995.0,1562d1,Black Ops II Zombie weapon discussion,FeartheJerry,26,4,50,"Just wanted to create a post in which people can post their favourite zombie weapons, and here's why:

* No PhD Flopper means that the raygun can no longer be used as a weapon to get out of tricky situations
* The raygun is only really effective up until the point when it become multiple shots to kill one zombie, for example. however, the early rounds are the ones you kind of want to 'point whore', and it seems that the raygun doesn't give nearly as many points as a gun that shoots bullets, due to no points from hitmarkers.
* At higher rounds it creates crawlers. these can be useful at the end of the rounds, if you need a crawler its easy to get one with claymores.

Although it seems like I'm hating on the raygun, especially with new weapons. I would rather choose the voice of justice of the raygun any day, due to the fact that the VoJ is a 1-hit-kill until round 30 (I think?), it doesn't have splash damage yet its still a small weapon which is good for running around, especially if you don't have stamin up.

**2.**Hit the mystery box and if you wanna reroll without spending any points just feed him while the gun is still outside the box and he will kick it for another roll


**3.**Feed him near a crafting bench and he will go retrieve the parts and build it quickly. If you don't have the Turbine built and you feed him near the bench in the court house or by the jail cell bench he will build that first before the trample steam.


**4.**Feed him near the subsurface resonater and he will go grab the turbine and set it down near the resonator.


**5.**Feed him near a crawler and he will pick up the crawler protecting it while following you.

It's pretty much common knowledge that MoTD takes place on New Years Eve 1933. This is from the audio logs that are obtained during the Pop Goes the Weasel easter egg. It is commonly accepted that Sal, and Weasel are mobsters in prison for doing mobster shit (honestly can't remember off the top of my head if there is actually anything in game to verify WHY they are in prison, it's early).

And that is where the problem starts. In 1933 Alcatraz wasn't in operation as a federal penitentiary until 1934. Prior to its use as a federal prison it had been used a military fort and prison. As a federal prison Alcatraz opened ""officially"" on July first 1934.

So what gives? Is it a simple mistake on the game designers part? Or is there some strange, but with as much effort as they put into getting so many other details right....

Also an interesting side note: I learned something while double checking my facts this morning that I found interesting. There was never an electric chair or gas chamber or any other form of capitol punishment located on Alcatraz Island. So it is fitting that the only time we see the electric chairs is on the bridge.",self,t5_2sal9,False,,sliquifier,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1fkwho/wait_what/

The setting is at a mountain, one at the East base of the mountain, one at the West, one at the North and finally one at the South  base of the mountain. There would also be mini lodges on the East, West, North and South sides of the mountain halfway up. Finally there is a small lodge at the top. Here comes the interesting part: there are ski lifts from each base lodge to the lodge halfway up the mountain (i.e. from East base lodge to East halfway up lodge), and then from there they all go to the summit. To activate each ski lift, similarly to the power in Tranzit. After they have been activated, and maybe the PDW (or a new wall weapon), you can place it at the top of one of the ski trails. These ski trails are from the top to the 4 halfway up lodges

There could be buildable coat thing, it just makes you freeze about a minute slower than normal.

For Reference

So there has been much debate here and on the official CoD Forums as to whether hell hounds are in the new map
Why They Are Not HellHounds: HellHounds were created when Samantha's pregnant Dog, 1933 - April 19, 1937. Why? because in the background there's the unfinished Golden Gates Bridge, and seeing as its close to being finished, I'd say 1935-1937. So clearly not during the WWII era where the HellHounds were created.

What Could They Be?: I Personally believe that Dog in the Video (2:59-3:00) is the Wardens Guard Dog.
""That's stupid DeathGod616, even though its for literally a second, you can see the Dog Barking at you, yet its not moving. Upon further inspection, I think i can see Chains around the dogs ""Neck"" (I say ""Neck"" since the Dog just seems to be a head). This would make complete sense given the Prison Environment... and why its not moving towards the player even though it clearly acknowledges the Players presence.

Boss Zombie: Why i think there's is most definitely going to be a boss zombie is because for some reason I just have it in my mind that this is going to be very similar to Call of The Dead (CoTD), or even speculate on this.

THE WARDEN: http://i.imgur.com/7cnf5SB.jpg

Obviously this zombie sticks out the most. Very well dressed, can you? Now, from his appearance alone, he doesn't seem to be able to tank a lot of hits like George A Romero... Nor does he seem as slow as George Either... so maybe this Warden is a speedy little fucker that just runs around locking you up? I don't know. Maybe this Zombie is the reason this map is the ""most terrifying"" map yet.

Well those are my thoughts. What are yours?

Because I have really been enjoying zombies recently though, then I died from being stuck.

Them I tried it a second time. I learnt you could use landers, I 'built' the rocket and launched it, and destroyed it too (I had read before you could destroy it but I didn't know how to launch it/what to use. 

Now I am still on that game (paused at the moment) at round 33. It just is so much easier. I have a tactic (will post if you want) which is ammo efficient. I am using the ray gun and some other light machine gun both of which have been pack a punched. All of this without Internet help...

1376199403.0,1k4qej,[Update] Samuel has the Maxis Diary?,GameChanger_Reddit,26,8,3,"[Original post here

[Picture of said book

In case you didn't know, and even if he did, we would've at least had a loading screen entry of his work at some point. Speaking of loading screens, ever wonder about the Maxis diary entries. Sure, it can *just* be a little insight to this whole situation in a canonical (and cheaper compared to new radios and voicelines) form. What if there was something more to it? How can we be getting all this information if the book hadn't been found. Maxis is hesitant to talk about his plan for total control, so obviously he's not letting a group of imbeciles read his thoughts and personal opinions on topics.

""But Gaaame! Where's your proof? You're not ""Perform Actions in an Activity in the Middle""! You're right, I've stumbled upon a post by the [lovely CoDz forums] (http://www.callofdutyzombies.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=100&amp;t=34328) that contained quotes that pertained to a story in either a minor, or major way. Samuel has some quotes in Die Rise which I find is very very interesting. Particularly *""Oh - it's this book! It's cursed!""*. Even though  he doesn't provide audio proof of the quote, I'll happily trust a regular poster in the forums. 

How did Sam even find the Diary? Why did he keep it? Was it the voices? Answers to that and more on the next episode of *""As the Post Apocalyptic World Turns""*!
