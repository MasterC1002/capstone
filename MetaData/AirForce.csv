He never claimed to be anything other than an E3, but even if he did... **so fucking what**. There are civilian Airmen serving all over the god dammned Air Force and they've never been to BMT. Does that make them less important to our mission? Hell no. How is this any different.

Did the kid get mouthy? Sure he did. Right after 20 people started talking mad shit to him. He wasn't being a dick, and he gave the anecdotal evidence of his father who's a Gen select that never went through basic. He wasn't running around saying that everyone has to salute him or give him upvotes. He was just trying to show that people can contribute to the service without going through basic.

I walked in to the Air Force recruiter's office in 2011 knowing one thing - I was going to join.  I said the one thing every recruiter dreams of hearing... ""Can you give me the first job that ships?""  He laughed and of course told me to slow down a little bit.

I had some misdemeanors (disorderly conduct) to work out, and gave me a phone interview before he signed the waiver.


I wasn't an easy case, but I stopped in once a week to see if there were any changes.  Once he saw that I was serious about this shit, he started pushing it upwards.  

Recruiters don't need to hound people these days.  They have enough people walk into their office every day to keep them busy enough.  
They have to wade thru the guys that come in every month ""just to talk about it"", the kids who blatantly lie about their eligibility.
Think of it not as a recruitment

 
If you are wondering about basic training, and so will you.


I joined for 6 years.  Basic will account for 2.5% of my Air Force time.  Even if you only join for 4 years


On my dreamsheet in basic, then cool.  If not, you'll learn how to deal with it.


Where am I now?  I'm a flightline maintainer, 6 days a week, somewhere in a desert.


On the other hand, Las Vegas, the Azores, Sicily, and southeast Asia.

I bought a decent car and paid it off in full.


I've got a savings account and an Associate's degree now.


I've got a team that I will work my ass off for


I have no idea what G.I bill I signed up for

If you can get more done outside the Air Force in two years than I've done

Effective 1 April 2013 the following revised procedures will apply:

Lodging
All personnel performing temporary duty (TDY) are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on government business travel. If weather permits
Bus terminals

Transportation:
Hitchhiking is the preferred mode of travel in lieu of commercial transport.
Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all personnel prior to their departure on TDY. Bus transportation will be used only when work schedules require such travel. Airline tickets will be authorized in extreme circumstances and the lowest fares will be used. For example, NE, then travel to Omaha will be substituted for travel to Washington D.C.

Meals:
Overweight personnel will not receive reimbursement for any meals purchased while TDY. Expenditures for meals will be limited to an absolute minimum. It should be noted that certain grocery and specialty chains, General Nutrition centers, and occasionally Safeway often provide free samples of promotional items. Entire meals can be obtained in this manner. We realize many of you survive your weekends this way.

Travelers should also be familiar with indigenous roots, travelers should use ""all you can eat"" salad bars. This is especially effective for employees traveling together as one plate can be used to feed the entire group. DOD Personnel are also encouraged to bring their own food on business travel. Cans of tuna fish, Spam, and Beefaroni can be consumed at your leisure without the bother of heating or costly preparation.
Cost of these items will not be reimbursed.

Miscellaneous: In order to facilitate acquisition of lodging and meals as prescribed above

In addition

1348775002.0,10kuo8,UPDATE - Two days ago I posted about a guy I work with making unbelievable claims about his USAF service.  Here is what else I found out.,throwaway54251,69,12,36,"Original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/10ggq0/i_work_with_a_guy_who_makes_wild_claims_regarding/)

Let's call my faker guy ""Bob"" just for simplicity.  I saw Bob yesterday and started asking him a few questions.  I did not straight up call him out

I asked him if he had any pictures of himself and/or his unit.  He said cameras were contraband in his unit because there could not be any proof of who they were

I asked him what class he was in, of course, ""That's all classified.""  And then he added, ""They didn't keep records of me or my unit.  As far as the government is concerned... I don't exist.""  Whatever.  

Apparently my questions threw him into bullshit mode because a woman we work with came into the room and heard us talking about the military.  She stated that she really wishes there were better mental health care for our service members because a lot of them are coming home with PTSD, leans back in his chair with both hands behind his head, and says ""Yeah, that's why you all never hear me talk about my time 'over there.'  If you all knew all the shit I've seen...  All the shit I've been through...  All the shit I've DONE...  Let me put it to you this way, I had 22 men in my unit.  Only 2 made it back alive.  And only ONE made it back sane.""  You know, because he's such a bad ass.  

His shift ended, and she goes on to tell me about how none of his stories adds up and how a lot of the time they clash together.  She then tells me he also claims to be a registered nurse and that he got his certification for that from all his combat medical experience.  She told me she suspected he was a liar for a long time, but she became positive of it when she met Bob's father back in December.  She asked him what Bob did in the USAF, and he said Bob was a medical supply truck driver.  And that's it.

We're here to understand how to beat it.  And it has nothing to do with intelligence.  It has to do simply with how much effort (*efficient effort*) you are willing to put into it.  
  
Here's the rub: You can study for a thousand hours if you want, it's turning it into something that your brain is forced to digest and incorporate.  
  
Here's the best tips I have (and feel free to ask me anything if you like):  
  
- **Leave**.  I took a month of leave for every WAPS I took.  For SSgt this was slight overkill, with an hour for physical fitness.  That month of leave was hardcore study time, and little else.  
  
- **The .mp3s help**.  Only a small portion of studying consisted of reading the material.  For the PDG
  
- **Study like a villian**.  For the SKTs
  
- **MKTS Survey**.  This is pretty common knowledge these days
  
- **Make the information your own**.  One of the most important things I did was buy tons of art supplies and acted like I was in fourth grade again.  I had a mega-set of colored pencils, I would create my own notecard or info sheet all about it.  I used a variety of colors and doodles to make the info really pop out, and because I was the one creating this, my brain stored it differently than it would if I were just reading it.  Information that you create is held in higher regard than things you are merely passively reading.  The trick is to make your brain think that the WAPS material is your own creation.  
  
- **Immersion.**  By the time test time came around, but it also provided an almost 3-D reference for it.  I distinctly remember a few questions on the test where I thought, ""Hmmm, I had a notecard about this halfway down the hallway; what did it say again?  Oh yeah...""
  
- **Usage of commercial software**.  I used commercial software each time, and with a month of leave, sure you might as well dive into some of them.  But I wouldn't pin all your hopes on the software or websites out there.  At most, I would make them a third of your total studying.  
  
- **Go easy on multiple choice tests.**  One warning about endless multiple choice questions is they end up tricking your brain into memorizing the incorrect answers along with the right one.  So basically

I'm definitely going to use the the approach of taking them aside and having a discussion. I think they think I'm just new to the AF too and so it doesn't count. A conversation with a green rope should help, and I served with one of their instructors too in two locations so I'll bring it up with him as a problem as a whole.*",,False,self,1372886404.0,t3_1hkq0a

She was telling me that she is going to have to close down the shop next month.  She didn't say why but my guess is that the shop doesn't really get a lot of traffic.  

I love supporting local business so I asked her to design and make me an ABU bi-fold wallet.  She makes all sorts of other little things out of ABU material so I thought I would give it a shot.  I have never seen a bi-fold abu wallet anywhere before.  I have seen lots of ACU wallets but they are all tri-fold.  I went in today and she actually had a prototype!  She can pretty much make them completely custom.  She said she can make it out of blouse material

Lets say you're in a typical squadron with anywhere from 20 to 40 computers and you're not lucky enough to have one of your own. You, that means you have to start from scratch with things like mapping the squadron share drive, mapping to any printers you use regularly or starting over with you outlook email signature. 

Well, it does all that crap for you. Plus, it's not a security risk (like those pesky USB drives) or anything because the script doesn't do anything you wouldn't have already done, it just automates it all. Also, this information isn't AF specific in any way, you could use this file if you get out and move into the corporate world. So, lets break it down and then I'll put it all together at the end.

**TL;DR The paragraphs are only to explain the process to those not so technically savvy. If you're a pretty good with computers

To start, no signature or shortcut copying.

* If you want the script to copy your outlook signature

To start, you'll have to find them to copy them to your personal folder. To find your signatures, press WindowsKey and r and the same time to bring up the run dialog and type ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures"" and press enter. Once that folder opens up, copy everything in there (folders and all) to a folder called ""OutlookSig"" in your personal folder. The line of code that does this is here:

    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\OutlookSig"" ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures"" /s

1. [robocopy](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) is the command to copy stuff
2. The first set of quotes is the path to your OutlookSig folder and must be exact and in quotes
3. The second set of quotes will direct robocopy to copy from your OutlookSig folder to the local signature folder on the computer.
4. the /s makes sure that robocopy copies the subdirectories as well


* If you want a folder of commonly used shortcuts

Now make a folder in your personal folder called ""Shortcuts"". In here you can place any shortcuts you use regularly in here, etc... The script will then copy theses shortcuts to the desktop.

    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\Shortcuts"" ""%userprofile%\Desktop"" /s

1. robocopy
2. path to your shortcut folder
3. path to your desktop on that specific computer
4. same as above

* if you want the script to map any drives you commonly use

All you need to do for this part is make sure you know the path to these drives/folders and the drive letter you'd like them to be assigned to. For example, you probably have an R: drive too. All these drives are is just a shortcut to a network location. Your I: drive is something like \\base_server\squadron_share_drive and so on. The line in the script will look like this:

    NET USE P: ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder"" /p:YES

1. The [NET](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/251394) USE part is the command to start the mapping process.
2. The P: is the drive letter you'd like to assign,A and I are usually already taken).
3. The part in quotes is the path to the folder and must be exact.
4. The /p:YES is short for persistent

And you just rinse and repeat for every network drive you need mapped.

* and last but not least

This part is easy or hard

    START \\printer_server\printer_name

1. [START](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/start.mspx?mfr=true) is just the command to open the resource
2. \\printer_server\printer_name is the path to the printer.

The great about mapping printers this way is that windows will automatically download the correct/best printer driver for you so there's none of that ""WTF

**With that

    @ECHO MAP I: DRIVE 
    NET USE I: ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive"" /p:YES
    
    @ECHO MAP P: DRIVE 
    NET USE P: ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder"" /p:YES
    
    @ECHO PRINTER NUMBER 1
    START \\printer_server\printer_name
    
    @ECHO PRINTER NUMBER 2
    START \\printer_server\other_printers
 
    @ECHO COPY SIGNATURES
    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\OutlookSig"" ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures"" /s
 
    @ECHO COPY SHORTCUTS
    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\Shortcuts"" ""%userprofile%\Desktop"" /s


Hold the F up

Great, all that pain in the ass crap is taken care of. Should work on Windows 7, vista and XP.

Should any problems arise with finding the path to the squadron share drive

I'm sure comm guys/gals will jump in here and add any specific advice or relevant regulations to the discussion which is most welcome. I hope this helps people out and makes a lot of the hassle of using a new computer easier. If you ever PCS/PCA

advice here before I go and do anything stupid. I made a throwaway account just for the hell of it.

Ive been in the AF a year; my experience with it varies but for the most part it has been good. But recently I've been having some issues and it's swiftly and noticeably affecting the way I work and my enthusiasm to work. 

My supervisor, just myself) and it's beginning to take its toll on me to the point that I actually want to leave the AF after my term is up.

A good example is I am working quite hard and out of no where he steps up to me and goes ""Get the FUCK to work!"" and just walks off. Ten seconds before

Another occured recently. Keep in mind
find me to check up on me (Meanwhile Im praying he doesnt randomly
spaz for no reason). I was in a meeting with another Airman and he
walks in. I assumed he was checking on me again. Turned out he wanted the Airman I was in the meeting with. I ask if he needed me and he says ""Was I fucking talking to you?"". I just blink at him
dumbfoundedly and he tells me I spoke out of turn.

I express my dislike of his behaviour against me and he just replies with ""If you don't like it, and to not take him seriously. It is clear to me that due to his attitude in general, he is not well liked within the shop and in turn it affects how he treats others.

Unfortunately for me

My question to you folks is, or go directly to the superintendent? Or, am I just being too soft and need to grow a pair?

It is so much easier...to just do what you're supposed to do. There is so much less stress

If you know you are doing what you're supposed to

It comes with a downside. If you're reliable, frankly, it is. But it is so much more rewarding and confidence building.

If I'm out of the office, people know it. They're going to question everything you do and look for reasons (and sometimes make up reasons) for why you should be in trouble.

Don't be an asshole to people, and you're going to have an easy and enjoyable time.

Having went through the process last year let me help you out some. Obviously, give a call to your in service recruiter. They should point you in the right direction. I cannot stress enough that you talk to your chain, since there will be letters you will possibly need from the commander, as well as at the end of it AFPC submits the whole package to your CC to ask if he concurs or not. Having a random package just pop into his inbox is a sure fire way of him non concuring, and while in the end it is up to AFPC and career functionals, having a concur looks better than non. Plus, it's simply the right way to do things. 

There are some other oddities (No referal EPRs, but this is the general rule for early retrain (Also known as CAREERS): 

4-year enlistees must be within the 35th and 43rd month of their current enlistment to apply

6-year enlistees must be within the 59th and 67th month of their current enlistment to apply

Must not be under investigation by the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) or law enforcement officials (excluding normal security clearance)

Most recent EPR must be at least 3 or higher

Must not be ineligible for promotion or reenlistment

Must not be in Training Status Code ""0"" (not recommended for entry into upgrade training)


The critical listing comes out with updates every so now and then, click enlisted, as highlighted. Type in Critical List, as show, then click search, as highlighted [example] (http://i.imgur.com/xNg4Ptx.png). You should then come to this screen. Click on Active Duty Enlisted Chronic Critical Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) List, as highlighted. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/gbdl0vp.png) The results will look like this. At the bottom will be the Retrain Advisory link, you'll want to click that. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/vRbnWsa.png) It will look like this. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/sdCDJDh.png) The information you are trying to look for is the AFSC of the critical listed jobs, for the numbers they are wanting for the FY listed. Also ensure it says OBJ IN. You best chances are to pick jobs that have high numbers. Even if you are an NCO

To start the process, click on Apply for Retraining as I have highlighted. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/XLqgtSu.png)

Youll then come to this screen. I recomend reading through it all. Once you are finished

Youll come to this screen. Click the CAREERS button, and I will explain that later. THen you have to wait. (Lost the screenshot for this, but it should be self explanitory)

Eventually, as highlighted, and then incidents, as highlighted. You should see one that says something along the lines of Retrain Request - FTA, as highlighted. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/CXfDYS8.png) 

This will be the message log between you and them. After you get approval

Some information once you get to the finished part. 

Once your application is completely finished, congrats! If not, it will go to second, and then third. If not selected by the third time, you cannot retrain anymore until you are eligble again. Note: CAREER (early) retraining USES your First Term Airmen retrain, so if you dont get accepted, you'll have to wait until you can try again. 

The process is long and frustrating at points. Use all your resources available to you. CONSTANTLY CALL AFPC. I cannot stress this enough. The more you bug them about things

If you have any other questions, another website to mess with, etc.

* He was a personal escort for Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi when they each visited the White House back in the '80s (when he was approximately 24 years old).
* Due to his high-level security clearance
* Anytime anyone questions him (e.g. ""Where were you stationed?"")

I would like to know if he is full of it.  Each of his claims seems far-fetched on its own, then maybe he shouldn't be divulging all of this information?  Sorry for any formatting errors.

Why would recruiters not do everything in their power to ensure you were happy with your job? I would imagine that your productivity would be significantly higher than if you were just put into a job you really have no interest in...

My example is that I am a photographer. I chose the job and I enjoy my job. I work hard to produce the best product possible and strive to learn every day. I would estimate that over 70% of the career field is open general/washouts from other career fields. And most of those people just show up to collect a paycheck without really having any desire to produce good work. This means that we are not getting the most out of the 450ish people we have... We could probably cut those numbers by 25% and still be able to accomplish what we need to just by having people who want to be there..

I am sure this is applicable to other career fields. I can't count how many people in my job who have said

Personally I would rather work with people who WANT to be there... I am sure most would agree with me.

So why would it be so hard to just make a little bit of an effort to just get people the job they want

The e-mail notifying us of this event specified that the AF personnel in attendance were to wear the PT shorts, I ripped one of the sleeves of my PT jacket pretty badly but I never bothered to replace it because I also own a PT sweater (the grey one) that was purchased no more than two years ago and I use (and prefer) when it is cold enough to merit wearing it. Our section was absolutely slammed all day, the kind of day where I take 10 minutes to wolf down some food before returning to work, and at no point would I have had anywhere near enough time to go out and purchase a jacket just for this run. In my section, we are required to always have a set of PT gear in our locker, in the event that they call an unexpected mandatory PT session for that day so I do keep all the items that I could ever need on hand: running shoes/socks, a pair of AF PT shorts and pants, sweater

When I showed up at the run

Please tell me that I'm not crazy for thinking there is in no way some kind of regulation that states owning the PT jacket is mandatory and that being tasked to show up to an event with the circumstances I described above is something I could get paperwork over? Anybody else ever been through anything like this?

**TL;DR** I have always used the grey AF PT sweater instead of the jacket for PT when it's cold outside because I no longer own the jacket and I got my ass chewed for it today. What reg. states it's mandatory to own the jacket?

**Edit:** So SilentD cleared it up and it appears I am in the wrong.

So I went to the base club last night and saw Mitch Fatel as the headlining act of a comedy show wrapping up its tour with our base. I had seen him before on Comedy Central and YouTube, but most good comedians can elicit those from any audience. 

For those of you who haven't seen or heard this guy's stand up, 98% of the show. And a lot of them were hilarious.

What I'm wondering is with the SAPR culture we're rapidly becoming, from what I'm told (it wasn't my base so I didn't recognize the faces) the wing commander and command chief. I can imagine it would hard to prosecute an actual SAPR or SARC case when they were just seen at the club laughing at some of the filthiest jokes I've heard in a long time. These are jokes that, should you or I tell them at work or even off duty somewhere, and the wrong person overheard, we could be in serious career jeopardy. 

Considering we were the last stop on the tour

Long story short: 

I've been enlisted for about two years now (but really only 3 months in operational. I had/have a medical issue that put me out of service for about 1 and a half years)
I'm still going through Chemo Therapy, and trouble focusing/concentrating.

So now that you know I'm not normally this...stupid... I beg for your mercy.

So here it goes...
My question:

I can't remember the order of chain of command. And I'm too embarrassed to ask my supervisor. (I'm an A1C soon to be SrA...ya i know)

So lets say I need to talk to someone (as an example, just in case) and I go up the coc. Lets see if I got this right. First person would be my supervisor first, SSgt X. If it doesn't get solved, then is it to the NCOIC? Or is it the TSgt above my supervisor, then the NCOIC? 
Then after that if it doesn't get resolved is it the First shirt -&gt; SMSgt Functional Manager (Senior) -&gt; Chief -&gt; and then Squadron Commander. ??? Then after that the Group Ommander?
Or is it different? I'm sure it is and I can't for the life of me recall the order.
Please let me know some examples of title and the name and rank. Like NCOIC TSgt SoandSo

Just a guy trying to join the military with no prior experience.

I started my process by filling out the ""Request More Information"" form on airforce.com. (Which btw is a great website for info

It took a few days for the recruiter to contact me but it was understandable. I submitted the form late on a Friday night

The next step was to get me into his office and take the Practice ASVAB. (I hadn't taken it up to this point.) He scheduled a meeting at 10:00 for the upcoming Friday. I showed up to the office a little early

I took the Practice ASVAB and scored pretty good on it

Of course, my case file, etc... He even made a few joke about how "" The Air Force is the leading technological branch in the U.S. Military, and we use more paper than anyone!"" I laughed at that. He did a good job with keeping the mood light and not as serious as a business meeting.

We end ended the meeting after he showed me the standard Air Force recruiting video and even showed me a video on the kind of job I wanted (Security Forces.) I left the meeting very

* If someone makes more money than you; call them Sir/Ma’am
* Remember a Chief is always a CHIEF
* If you're not listening or working in a position
* Never refuse to do a chow run.
* Never get visibly or noticeably upset when asked to do clean up or weeds and seeds.
* Never get visibly or noticeably upset when someone else gets priority in training over you. Discuss how you feel in private
* Whenever you are the ""new"" person in an ATC facility; keep to yourself for the first few weeks and get a feel for those you will be working with and for before you start running your mouth. Don't try to be ""one of the guys"" right away.
* Take pride in your uniform and never be a duffel bag (wearing your uniform like a sack).
* Try to be the first to show up for work and the last to leave (don't be a 45er).
* If you are going to be late; call first and always bring doughnuts (do not make showing up late for work a habit).
* If you don't have INTEGRITY get some real quick.
* Keep track of all your accomplishments throughout the year and provide this list to your supervisor when it comes time to write your EPR.
* Volunteer for additional duties and projects to the extent possible (remember your training comes first though).
* Start going to school as soon as you can (take CLEP and DANTES tests if you are unable to take classes).
* Serve at least one overseas tour before you decide to get out of the military.
* Learn anything the Air Force is willing to teach you for free.
* Take pride in your profession and never bad mouth it while you are still receiving a paycheck.
* Learn as much about YOUR entitlements and benefits.
* When in doubt
* Never try to duck away
* Find someone in your organization whom you admire or who has their act together and try to emulate that person to the extent possible without losing sight of your own identity.
* Have confidence in yourself and always try to exceed standards (go above and beyond what's expected).
* Don't keep secrets from your supervisor
*Remember a chain has many links when using the chain of command.
* Finally

Personally

I already have an Associates from a state university (UVU for reference) so I'm just looking to take classes towards my bachelors.  A lot of credits that I had (over 130 hours worth) did not transfer to some of the requirements for AMU.  As it stands, I thought that the class was good, the text-book was good, but the professor graded all of us really easy.  I turned in an 8 page paper for a 10 page assignment, and still got 100%  

As it stands

Who is going where?  What has your experience been?  Do you feel that you are getting an education for your money?  These companies are eating up our TA; we owe it to ourselves and our fellow airmen to make informed decisions about who is getting rich off our benefits.

I’ll try to summarize. I was in for 4 years as [5R051](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforceenlistedjobs/a/afjob5r0x1.htm) Got out on good terms


I then spoke to an Air Force recruiter in early September. I tried in the past and I was told air force wasn’t taking prior service so I checked every fiscal year or so. This time we started the paperwork. I wrote a letter of why I want to be in the Air force etc. I still had and supplied all my firewall 5 EPRs. My personal record is STILL clean, and no tattoos.



I was told I’ve have to retrain so I had to retake the ASVAB a second time and after taking 4 weeks to study I got a 78 for contracting
My recruiter then submitted all my paperwork to the squadron level. They needed a wavier because my 6 year mark would be up (Nov 18th 2012) which is the limit of being out of the Air force to get back in. This was around early November by the way. My recruiter was awesome enough to write a wavier and re-submit it. It got approved and sent to AFRS HQ.
~~                                                                                                                                              ~~

AFRS denied my request because of the 6 year waiver, it took 20 weeks with *several* checks and balances along the way…… to get denied. Hopes of fixing my regret………crushed…… 


**TL;DR** Took 20 weeks of hoop jumping and waiting to get denied joining the world’s greatest Air Force at the *last* step..


Those currently serving – Be grateful to be part of such an awesome service! And thank you for sticking with it!
