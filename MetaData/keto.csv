EDIT FOR OFF THE WALL AMAZEMENT!!!!!!!!!!

************Guys who ever gave the reddit Gold THANK YOU. Please no more gifts though

Let me tell you what I am here for.

I am here for people like John (name changed) who messged me because he is at the end of his rope and ready to give up in life. He has been bullied and made fun of and had no one to talk to. 

If weight loss has done ONE FREAKING THING for me

I found r/keto browsing /r/all. Being able to see the progress pic with ease piqued my interest and brought me in. *I would likely not be here otherwise*.

We vote to bring the things we want to the top. I'm sorry you mods don't like what we like

I'm starting a new subreddit

I am unsubbing from /r/keto. If you object to this decision

EDIT: another option is /r/theketodiet

EDIT2: I'd like to bring some attention to a portion of andr50's comment. While I don't agree with all of it (I am recommending leaving)

&gt; If the mods are not happy about the science articles not hitting the top, front-page keto sub, and spec the science to /r/ketoscience or something. Make ANOTHER place for jsut the stuff they want propagated, and keep the 50k+ subscribers who subscribed already because of what the community IS (not what they want / think it could it to be)

I just want to start off by saying that finding this subreddit and using the tools and motivation here is basically saving my life.  In just over 2 full months I feel more alive than I have in many many years. Everyone here along with my friends and family have been so supportive and I am feeling better than ever.  Right before I started keto I had reached a state where any physical activity left me in extreme back pain so I had decided to solve this by simply not doing anything and missing out on things in life.  Now.. I am ripping and ready to go at all times and can do many many things without feeling pain.. I've still got a long way to go but I feel like I've come a long way so far..   

As promised here is the picture set.  Left side.. heaviest

***Please upvote for visibility. This is a self post and receives no karma.***

We’ve recently been discussing the future direction of this community and have found that many of the science-based posts and other relevant discussions are buried under an endless list of progress pictures and food porn. We love all of your amazing weight loss stories and to see the results of this lifestyle change on so many different people is truly inspiring. We also believe that this community is a place to help people succeed with Keto. That being said, nothing changes. What does this change?

_________________________
**Progress Pictures:** We'd love for you to create a writeup that lets people know about your specific keto experience; where you started, how you've overcome them, some of your favorite recipes, tips for beginners, where you'd eventually like to end up, your plans to get there, etc. And with this write-up

**FoodPorn:** Same deal. We want to know how you made whatever it is you’re eating! Post a recipe or even a simple process if it’s just something you threw together in the kitchen. If it’s a really well thought out recipe or an external link

**Scale Pictures:** Please don’t. It’s really exciting to look down and see a number you haven’t seen in a long time (or have never seen) and to know that you’re making progress, 99kg, or 20 stone?? Take photos of yourself along the way, or even just before and afters!

_________________________

We really think this small change will result in an overall boost in quality posts on /r/keto. We want to encourage more content and detailed information along with your posts of infographics

Martinus and LadySixString have been working tirelessly to get our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq) updated and ported over to the new Reddit format and we’ve got some great info in the [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/about/sidebar) and [Keto In A Nutshell](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZfJejOM8fJsX1iCilmnpp1qmT_KncJwWCR4-EsaEHc/edit?pli=1) that tend to answer 98% of the questions you’ll have regarding Keto. Read through everything and still have a question? Either enter a keyword in the keto search bar or create a post! There are literally thousands of people who have been exactly where you are that can answer just about any question you throw at them.

Thank you all for being a part of this amazing community! We can’t wait to see what 2013 brings!

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.

Size has always dominated me, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.

Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.

Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big &amp; Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.

And time just passed by - I built powerful, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.

I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.

A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back

Fortunately it only took about six months, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.

I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.

I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today

Thank you to Mom, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Margie

Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

So recently /r/keto has gotten a few shout outs in mainland reddit with crossposts and bestofs and such.  I wanted to make this post as a sort of general guide to keto noobs who inevitably ask the same questions.

**Can I eat (X)?**

You can do whatever the hell you want, milk, and beans are high in carbohydrates and incompatible with a keto lifestyle.  However, we shouldn't have to tell you that because this data is posted for free online.  If you don't know, look it up!  www.myfitnesspal.com www.nutritiondata.com www.sparkpeople.com are all great sites with great nutritional information.

**Herp Derp Coke Zero?**

what does the label say?  Diet soda won't knock you out of ketosis.  That's Broscience^TM.  It has no carbs.  What it will do

**Derpa doo calories?**

Yes, there is simply no way around that.  What Keto does is ensure that fat is the body's primary fuel source so that when you are in a caloric deficit, the body quickly burns the fat stored on your body.  Ketosis is also, largely, an inefficient process and people often find that their base metabolic rate seems to be higher on keto, allowing them to lose more weight on a higher calorie intake than they were losing on a traditional restricted calorie diet.  Get into ketosis first, make good habits to avoid carbs for 2 weeks, but this is short lived and you will stall out.

**Narf narf keto flu?**

Some get it, is dehydrated (DRINK YOUR DAMN WATER) and may be lacking in electrolytes.  Meat broth, coffee, and heaps of fat are what you want here.  Also doing what you can to deplete the little amounts of sugar in your body as quickly as possible seem to help get your body into ketosis faster.  My prescription for the keto flu is to go to the gym, do a depletion workout with big heavy weights (squats, brah) and when you're done come back home and have a small meal of nearly entirely fat.  A heavy-cream protein shake, spoonfuls of coconut oil

**KOLESTERALL???**

Eating cholesterol doesn't make you have high cholesterol, your body will reward you.

**Chocklit fatkinz bars!!!!1**

Don't eat that atkins frankenfood bullshit.  It'll turn your ass into a firehose, you'll be glad you did.

By popular demand:  **i can haz cheet meel?**

Once again, largely because it will make you Take A Dump^TM  The danger here is that a cheat meal or cheat day is not an excuse to pack yourself full of poptarts until your blood caramelizes.  Throw in a few carbs and the switch up will help keep your body on its toes.  The additional glycogen that results will also let you have a more intense workout or two which leads to confidence which leads to focus which leads to aesthetics.

    Edit: **Thank you all who put forth suggestions. I will be remaking this entire thing in the next couple of weeks. I know there is much to be improved on, etc. It is a work in progress! I'm still not sure if high saturated fats should be blue or green, as there is some debate.**

     Here is some improvements you can look forward to:
* Better pyramid category organization and more accurate food items and descriptions
* Improved color scheme (including accessibility for color-impaired
* Complete nutrition information for items in the table (adding them to the pyramid would be a bit messy)

To start off with, partly as an outlet.

Some background: I am a 34 year old male, so this enabled me to be a high functioning schizophrenic and bipolar person since then. I've always been employed, independent, stayed out of hospitals, and stuck with my medication. I've followed the advice of doctors and fought against this illness for 15 years and I had come a long way to rise above it on the road to recovery.

The medication has kept me going, I've still had nagging and critical voices in my head, mood swings, difficulty concentrating at times, and strong emotional highs and lows.

I'll try to cut the story a bit short here. After 5 weeks on keto I've lost roughly 26 pounds. I feel better than I can ever remember. My brain is firing better than it has in years

**Optimal Metabolism**

If you have trouble maintaining a healthy weight, not by a lack of will-power, lack of exercise, or even calorie intake. Here’s how it really works:

Fat cells secrete a hormone called leptin. Leptin travels from fat cells and tells a part of the brain. the hypothalamus, the hypothalamus matches appetite and energy expenditure, resulting in easy weight control. Likely you know someone like this. They seem to eat as much as they want, but they always stay lean and ﬁt. This person is leptin sensitive. They have a fat thermostat that works.

On the other hand, thus making the hypothalamus blind to leptin. Even though such a person might have a hundred pounds Of fat stored on their belly, energy to spare so to speak, the hypothalamus perceives that the body is actually starving. This hormonal “mismatch” drives excessive appetite, cravings, persistent fat storage, low sex hormone production, muscle wasting, you can eat like a bird and still gain weight.

So this begs the question, but here are a few of the big ones:

**THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH LEPTIN RECEPTOR DAMAGE:**

* inflammation
* high insulin levels
* poor sleep and/or night shift work
* low Vitamin D
* low Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio of fatty acids
* high blood sugar
* high triglycerides
* elevated LDLp form of cholesterol
* infections (viral
* high fructose corn syrup
* lectins and gluten from cereal grains
* an injury or severe illness
* high body fat percentage
* low exercise or sedentary job
* childbirth and/or multiple pregnancies
* too much stress: physical
* MSG, BPA, phenylalanine (common in processed foods)

The next question you might be asking yourself is whether it is possible to ﬁx the leptin receptors? Yes

**HOW DO YOU HEAL THE LEPTIN RECEPTOR?**

The most important leptin receptors are in the hypothalamus. This is an ancient part of the brain that controls hormones and circadian rhythms. It’s a part of the brain that requires sleep, proper nutrition, and in some cases, cold exposure to work well. Living your life in a way that maximizes hypothalamic function will ﬁx the “biological mismatches” that have fouled up your hormones and metabolism. **Achieving optimal health is all about correcting these mismatches and living as nature intended.**

Resetting your fat thermostat requires **5 LIFESTYLE CHANGES.**

**1.  DEFEAT STRESS: Stress raises cortisol and turns sex hormone production off. It also makes your cells more resistant to insulin. High cortisol and high insulin keep your cells in “fat-storage” not “fat-burning” mode.**

* Decide in your mind that you will be in charge of your health and your life.
* Resolve any high stress conflicts.
* Don’t procrastinate.
* Simplify your life.
* Take 10 slow
* Plan out your meals in advance
* Exercises like yoga, too.

**2.  EAT FOR YOUR GENES: The USDA food pyramid is not helping the nation’s obesity problem. The Standard American Diet is a complete failure. Our bodies crave nutrient dense food that satisﬁes our physiologic needs 100%

* Eat a “whole food” or “Paleo” style diet. More on diet is explained below.
* Don’t eat any processed
* Don’t eat anything with artificial sweeteners. Stevia might be the only exception.
* Eat a **BIG** breakfast with 30-50 grams of protein within an hour of waking up. Eat until you’re quite full. Don’t use protein powder (whey) for this. It causes an insulin and sugar spike.
* Eat 3 meals a day. Avoid snacking. Breakfast is big, low-carb dinner, your liver will burm fat all night long. Eventually you might only need 2 meals a day.
* Eating frequently
* Limit your carbohydrates to around 50-150 grams a day. Eat fewer carbs in the winter
* Eat dinner 4-5 hours prior to bedtime.

**3.  HACK YOUR SLEEP: Leptin enters the hypothalamus only in the deep stages of sleep. Your brain won’t know how to burn fat without it. We also repair our bodies (autophagy) during sleep. When we don’t repair damage, turns up cortisol (stress hormone that causes fat storage) and turns off sex hormone production.**

* Expose your eyes to natural sunlight every day
* Dim the lights in your entire house after dinner.
* Keep your bedroom cool and dark.
* Don’t read in bed.
* Wear yellow or amber tinted glasses after dimmer time. Yellow lenses block blue wavelength light. Low light levels prepare the brain for sleep.
* No bright lights
* Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep.
* Many people will start to lose weight when they turn off the TV

**4.  HEAL YOUR GUT: The total surface area of the gut lining is nearly two football ﬁelds. Although it is mostly hidden from us

* Avoid cereal grains, soy products, beans, excessive lactose and casein. See more on diet below.
* Eat some food with fermentable ﬁbers (starches like sweet potato, etc.).
* Eat fermented foods like keﬁr, kimchi AND/OR take a high-quality, multi-species pro-biotic tablet.
* Coconut oil is a super food for damaged intestines
* Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen
* Older patients might need HCL acid supplements.

**5.  TRY SOME COLD THERAPY: Cold exposure turns on growth hormone and GNRH, much of our calorie expenditure every day is related to heat production. You can easily burn as many calories generating body heat as running on a treadmill, for example. Cold exposure also sets the body up for excellent sleep.**

* Drink ice-cold water.
* Apply ice packs to your belly for 20-30 minutes a day (a “Colpac” brand oversized ice pack works Well and can be ordered on Amazon)
* Exercise in colder temperatures.
* Swim in cold water.
* Take some cold showers.
* Work up to taking cold-water baths


**A BIT MORE ON DIET**

The Standard American Diet (S.A.D) is well. ..SAD. Americans suffer from more chronic health problems than any other culture. Why? We eat low-vitamin-content food that our bodies aren't designed to use in an optimal way and that often leaves us feeling unsatisﬁed and hungry.

Much modern “food” messes up digestion

You are what you eat after all

Why not eat what the human body is designed to consume‘? Eat real food! (Just in case you were
wondering

Here’s what I avoid eating: **1) sugar, I don’t eat many legumes and not much milk.

The above mentioned foods are toxic to some degree for most people. Although these foods don’t typically make us acutely ill, diabetes, etc. I call such problems **diseases of civilization** because they rarely existed prior to the modem diet or among present-day indigenous cultures that eat natural foods. I ﬁnd that quite interesting.

If you avoid “the big 3” mentioned above, auto-immune disease, and heart disease. Here’s a short explanation why I don’t eat these foods.

* **Sugar** causes insulin spikes and damages the leptin receptors in the brain that control appetite. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar from going too high after you eat by storing that sugar as fat. Insulin spikes are bad because they trigger excessive appetite and eventually, an oxidative process that damages tissues, especially arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart attacks. Glycation also damages the “appetite control” leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. Having damaged leptin receptors puts your metabolism into “starvation mode”, even if you have too much fat already. Not good. Sugar makes you fat, especially around the waist, and the bigger your belly
* **Grains** trigger a hyperactive immune response in many people and damage the protective lining of the gut. This makes the gut “leaky” which allows all sorts of bad things to enter the circulation that shouldn’t — like poop! When the immune system has to deal with more than it can handle, skin tissue, lung tissue, etc. This haphazard stimulation of the immune system can exacerbate thyroid problems, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, it that they spike insulin levels just as much as pure sugar does. They also contain “phytates” that interfere with calcium, and zinc absorption. Lastly, you give yourself a triple whammy: hyperactive insulin
* Just like grains, canola, com, and soybeans contain an excessive amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids. If you eat too much omega-6, your body over-produces inﬂammatory proteins that can lead to health problems and pain. Additionally, most soy and com these days is also genetically modiﬁed.

Can we survive on a diet based on sugar, of course, but this is not optimal. When you are trying to restore your health, survival foods are not going to cut it. You need to eat foods that satisfy the dictates of our evolutionary heritage to have optimal health.

So

* Pretty much all **veggies** in any quantity you like. Get all the colors: green, purple, orange, and white, but go easy on the starchy potatoes if you want to lose weight. It’s best to eat these in spring, summer and fall, a bit less in winter. Organic is better if you can afford it. Growing your own is the very best
* **Fruit**: 2-3 pieces of fruit a day is okay, or have irritable bowels. Our hormones and metabolism are set up to eat fruit when the days are long and getting cooler —late summer and autumn. That’s the best time to eat them.
* **Fish**, cod liver oil, or krill oil supplements to get your Omega-3 fatty acids. The longest lived people in the world all eat **seafood: shrimp, scallops, lobster, clams, mussels**
* **Seaweed** is a super-food and can be a daily addition to your diet. If you decide to do a very low-carb
* Grass-fed or “free-range” meat: **beef, turkey, chicken,** etc. **Wild game** is great, too. Grass-fed meat and wild game has higher Omega-3s and many other nutrients than does “feed-lot” produced meat. Find a local rancher if you can. Store bought meat is not as good, but it’s okay. KSL classiﬁeds can be a good resource for this.
* **Butter, so drink water instead. I restrict dairy products in some patients, but for starters, it’s probably okay.
* **Eggs**, and grass.
* **Organ meats like liver and heart**
* **Bone broths**. Critical if you have arthritis, or osteoporosis.
* **Ghee, tallow, or coconut oil** are great for cooking.
* **Macadamia nut oil
* Small amounts of nuts are good for you. Macadamias are the lowest in Omega-6. Don’t go nuts on nuts
* Eat foods with “healthy” bacteria: **kefir,** etc.
* **Dark chocolate**
* Drink plenty of **ice-cold water**. Green tea is okay. Coffee if you like. Avoid other beverages.
* **Himalayan Pink Salt**. This salt has dozens of trace minerals and is vastly superior to table salt. It does not have iodine, you’ll be getting all the iodine you need. 
* **Sweet potatoes** are a safe
* Do not eat packaged and processed foods. Avoid soda

Beans and other legumes are okay when sprouted or cooked for a long-time, so I can’t give them a total green light. They might be okay in small amounts. Personally, I’ve stopped eating them.

If you want to lose weight

Most people will be less hungry on this diet and won’t need to cotmt calories. Just eat until you feel satisﬁed

Here’s a site with plenty of recipes: [http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex](http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex), some veggies, and a slice of fruit. Done.

Read Mark Sisson. His website also has a lot of great information: [www.marksdailyapple.com](http://www.marksdailyapple.com).

[http://perfecthealthdiet.com](http://perfecthealthdiet.com) is another resource I like.

**HOW WILL YOU KNOW YOUR “FAT THERMOSTAT” IS WORKING AGAIN?**

* Hunger and cravings greatly diminish
* Sleeping like a rock
* Feeling refreshed in the morning
* Less muscle soreness
* Mental calmness
* Steady weight loss
* Increased libido
* Softer skin and stronger nails
* Improved mental ability
* Fewer headaches
* Dreaming, exploring, etc.)
* More energy
* Firmer gums

**WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE?**

It’s important to wait until you have some clear signs of leptin sensitivity prior to working out hard. If you push it too soon, lifting weights, calisthenics, and eventually sprinting. You don’t ever have to jog again! (If you don’t want to, that is.) Exercise outdoors whenever possible. Long-distance running and cycling are not the best exercise for losing weight. Weight training, sprinting, and body—weight exercises like push-ups and squats are better. If you do these types of exercises at a high intensity level, it’s a good idea to get a treadmill test prior to working out to make sure your heart is good to go for it.

**WHAT PROBLEMS MIGHT ARISE WITH A BIG DIET CHANGE?**

* Moodiness — This can be mitigated with a 5-HTP supplement, fat is your friend with this one. Eat more coconut oil, olive oil, cream, butter, fatty ﬁsh like salmon, or bacon. Eating a high tryptophan food, along with a little bolus of carbs
* Headache, usually within a week.
* Smelly urine — this is from ketones in the urine and it generally a sign that you’re eating enough protein and the right amount of carbs. Don’t be alarmed.
* Constipation — If this happens
* Some people, just eat sweet potatoes, yams, bananas, or rice instead. As your fat burning machinery kicks in, you’ll be able to decrease carbs to 50 -150 grams/day eventually without feeling irritable.
* Plateaus: These are to be expected. Weight loss and metabolic optimization often progress in ﬁts and starts. You are rebuilding your metabolism and this takes time. If you plateau at a certain Weight for more than a month, and exercise pattems.


In general, they typically are not necessary.

For everyone:


* A high quality **multivitamin** helps because if you’re not eating a good diet, low cost way to get up to normal.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids** via ﬁsh oil or krill oil help restore the balance of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids. These two fatty acids use the same enzyme pathway, margarine, and vegetable oil. Too much Omega-6 causes persistent inﬂammation that damages the leptin receptors (and everything else for that matter.) I can take years of eating well to get to the proper balance. If you eat ﬁsh daily you probably don’t need a supplement. If you don’t eat much ﬁsh, take l-3 tablets a day.
* **Vitamin D** is low in most of my patients
* **Magnesium** is a required co-factor to make A/TP, threonate, or malate. Magnesium oxide is more readily available in stores, but doesn’t work quite as well.

For special circmnstances:

* **5-HTP** helps if you get moody while adjusting to a new diet. This is a serotonin precursor.
* **PQQ** (pyrroloquinoline quinone) helps rebuild muscle mitochondria.
* **Vitamin K2** is a co-factor for calcium-binding enzymes. This is good for people with osteoporosis
* **Ubiquinol** (the more costly form of Co-enzyme Q10) helps rebuild mitochondria in the muscles. This can really help when you’re ready to start more vigorous exercise.
* **DHEA** can help if you have a sex hormone deﬁciency or pregnenolone steal syndrome. It also helps with sleep. Men can take 50 -100mg. Women can start around 25mg. Repeat testing is essential with this one.

****EDIT****

There is a lot of discussion as to whether or not calories count in a diet.  I think one of the goals of this document is to look at it a bit differently than we have in the past.

[Leptin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin) is fairly new in our understanding of health.  It was discovered in 1994!  Just a couple of weeks ago

This document is making the case, and your brain isn't confused as to how much storage it has.

So - both sides are correct.  Calorie counting should not be discounted

But I can't stop thinking about what I read yesterday. Like many of you fellow ketoers being excited to have lost that ___ number of pounds and wanting to share

Let me say, apparently he didn't lose enough fat for that persons tastes.

Put yourselves in Honeymaids shoes for a minute. Here is a person happy that he is finally happy with his self and wants to thank our community for helping him get there. He even posts his before/after pics

Instead of getting pure inspirational comments, this is real people just trying to better themselves and occasionally sharing their stories with the community.

**TL/DR: I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and bacon and we'd all eat it and be happy...**

**Edit: Sorry I opened this can of worms everyone, and YOU get some bacon!**

**1) [This julienne peeler](http://www.amazon.com/Messermeister-Pro-Touch-Orange-Julienne-Cutter/dp/B003CT3S00/).**

Dude

Took me all of 90 seconds to do two big ass zukes and I do declare they make better tasting spaghetti than real noodles. I also use them in pad thai and curry. I mean sure carbs but they're so minimal and hey vegetables. Which leads into..

**2) Coconut. You can get oil in a jar

Add some butter and sweetener to the flour, but I like to just heat it with a couple tablespoons of curry paste and toss it on some vegetables.

**3) Speaking of sweeteners: [EZ-Sweetz](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MO765O/) is rad.** I ordered this stuff like 9 months ago and I use it all the goddamn time. Still have half a bottle left. Very no-fuss and super cost-effective.

**4) [Lazy keto chicken](http://cavemanketo.com/2012/06/23/lazy-keto-chicken/). It's the total weeknight warrior of keto recipes.** Anyone can make this and everyone should.

**5) [Yanni grilling cheese](https://www.karouncheese.com/images/products/155_tn330_Yanni-grilling-cheese-8oz.jpg). You put it in a pan and it [COMES OUT LIKE THIS!!](http://i.imgur.com/P0jMduV.jpg)** Okay so I had just fried bacon in that pan so it's not the prettiest shot

Once I tried to make mozzarella sticks and that was really LOL so I saw this stuff at Ralph's for $5 and gave it a shot. I swear to god it tastes like pizza hut stuffed crust. I'm going try to make mini-pizzas because I believe it will blow meatzas right outta the fucken park. I've seen it in both Kansas and SoCal so I think most people should find it.

My roommate was so impressed by the diet that he offered me 5 DOLLARS A POUND if I would help him lose weight. I got to decline all money and instead offer my infinite help sans a 10 dollar fee every cheat. I tried on my coworkers shirt tonight and fit comfortably into a large - from an xxl. ALL IN A 24 HOUR PERIOD!

I feel like I've learned the secret to life. It's so simple and yet thanks to a simple word named Atkins,,False,self,t5_2rske,False,,True

I'm incorporating cardio and just a tiny bit of strength training in with keto, it gives me wiggle room for carbs I may not know about.  I've broken it and went up to 15 on occasion, but for the most part I've done well to stick to my goals.  

As far as scale victories, because I rarely drank water.  It was all energy drinks and soda for me.  My goal weight is 125.

Non-scale victories are increasing rapidly for me.  I've moved 4 notches on my belt and went down a pants size.  We live near an army post, son and friends are telling me they can see the difference.  I even bought my first medium (men's medium, I hate women's clothing.

1363808773.0,1aolg9,[Rant] Is Butter a Carb? The Continuing Misadventures of Explaining Keto to My Father,saraquael,596,99,191,"My dad can eat a half gallon of ice cream by himself in one night. And he does.  

When I was a baby, practically frothing at the mouth. ""She can have a little. What's the harm?""   

So yes, the road to carb hell is paved with the sweet intentions of relatives. *Eat, you're too skinny. Have another helping, I made too much pasta. Try my ice cream. Do you want another piece of pie?* These people - we love 'em, but come on - are the reason that *some of us* have been known to sleepwalk to the kitchen and eat an entire cake at 3am.   

Okay, so I will tell you that I ate the absolute shit out of that cake, man. The scary part is that I would have no recollection of eating an entire 8-inch layer cake by myself if not for the forensic evidence:  a morning-after ring of chocolate around my mouth, or telltale chocolate frosting drool stains on my pillow. Did I use a fork, or did I just go at it with my bare hands, like a fucking raccoon foraging in a dumpster? Couldn't tell you. I like to imagine it like the sleepwalking scene in Step Brothers.  

I will also confess that this happened way more than once. Waking up to get a snack (sugar; always sugar) was a near-nightly ritual for me. One time I woke up with my sheets covered in chocolate streaks and a chocolate-chip cookie stuck to the small of my back

When I started keto in September, no bread, no pasta, no flour, and absolutely no sugar. He looked at me as if I had told him I was going to start shooting heroin to curb my appetite. He asked if this was a fad diet. He offered me a pack of Oreos. Now, my dad is Southern. *Really* Southern. He speaks slowly and sometimes it takes him a while to process the things his overly-excitable, fast-talking, because he's not: he just likes to take his time with things. So I try really hard to be forgiving when he offers me something that I can't have

Sometimes a simple ""no thank you"" doesn't appease him and I have to take whatever he's offered me or he'll follow me around for a while, hapless drug pusher. I usually just put it back in his sugar stash once he's gone, but it drives me absolutely nuts. I'm sure my fellow ketonians know exactly what I'm talking about, here. The unrelenting, misunderstanding, but ultimately well-meaning relative. Can't kill 'em, can't get 'em to stop offering you some of their ice cream.  

The worst is when he thinks he's following my diet. Somewhere along the line he heard ""bacon good"" - and this part stuck ok - but ""bread bad"" still fails to compute, but oh my god some days it's like he's doing it deliberately. And today I was feeling really bad about myself, so I almost said yes - screw it - gimme the fuckin' Elvis Special.  

But I didn't. Tiny victories.   

People love to tell you how to eat. This will not change, too. You have to remember that these people generally mean well, even when the things they say are hurtful or woefully misinformed. Everyone has an opinion and you won't change their minds, so you have to change the way you respond to it. Don't take it personally, even though it may be really hard not to. I know that my dad just wants me to be happy. Sugar makes him happy; sugar used to make me happy, too - and so did bread and all of that junk. But now my priorities have shifted. Being able to run without having a coughing fit, not having crippling acid reflux, lurking in cabinets and grocery store bakery cases and even in my dad's well-meaning hand

Even if I did take the bait it would be my own fault, an addict is exactly what I am. The first step is admitting you have a problem, right? I can't have cheat days, because I know I won't stop. I'll backslide right back into the lifestyle that made me feel like shit, made my asthma worse, made my stomach hurt constantly. And while I don't look down upon the people who can treat themselves and then jump back on the wagon, I have to accept that I am just not one of them.  

So no matter how many times a day my dad offers me something that I used to love

I'm always going to be the girl who sleepwalked to cake.

1362444634.0,19oaio,Twelve things I've learned from Keto.,Scott_MacGregor,599,100,159,"I'm making this post both for newbies and those considering adopting TKD

**1. Everyone is a nutritionalist.** You can scarcely describe the ketogenic diet to a layperson without having them either lecture you about how awful it is, even then they'll tell me that it can't work.


**2. EVERYONE is a nutritionalist.** Including you. Let's say I know about 3% about all their is to know about human nutrition, I'm six times smarter than this person, I ought to tell them what they should and shouldn't eat', but what I'm forgetting is that massive 97% of knowledge I don't have, and that, really, it's best for a variety of reasons to just keep my mouth shut. That, rather than giving generalized theories about nutrition


**3. People are bias in favour of simple, and when I start talking about different hormones, insulin, and metabolism, sometimes with long words, I can see the look of zoning-out in the face. Further, people don't like the idea that one problem might have two different causes. On [a recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/19kt53/rantif_i_hear_calories_in_vs_calories_out_is_bs/c8oys5p) in this subreddit, both with evidence to back up their claims; what neither of them realised† was that they *both* might be right and that

**4. The 'Fat bias' is really, a Thai red curry: were you to add 45g of heavy cream to it, it's suddenly unhealthy; but were you to add 100g of white rice to it, you've somehow made it a perfectly balanced and healthy meal. This despite the fact that they have roughly the same amount of calories, and the cream at least has some calcium.

**5. Weight loss is very unpredictable in the short- and medium-term.** I plateau for no reason. Sometimes I'll lose a lot of weight even when I'm drinking alcohol, and so many variables, our bias for a simple explanation leads us to oversimplified ideas of what's happening in our bodies in the short- and medium-term.


**6. Exercise isn't necessary for weight loss.** So whenever I hear some twit on the TV pontificating about how you *have* to exercise and *have* to get your heart rate up to some arbitrary bpm


**7. Convenience = Carbohydrates.** Of the three major macronutrients, then the person or company selling it to you is going to try their best to get out all the costly fat and protein, and load it up with cheap cheap carbohydrates. 

**8. Most foods can be replicated to be keto friendly, dumplings, and pasta have all ended in disaster. Pork rinds with guac, salsa, sour cream and cheese just didn't cut it, and shiratake noodles just taste like failure. Moussaka is just as delicious as lasagna, but I'm giving up on carbonara and bolognese altogether. Nothing can replace a wanton.


**9. Strangers will have more time for you, strangers' initial impression of you is that you've failed at something, so you're starting at a disadvantage. Or it could be that usually you're just more attractive when you're thin and strangers have a bias for attractive people.


**10. Being fat doesn't mean you will necessarily have a loose skin problem when you lose the weight.** I've lost on average about 0.6kg (or 1 and a third lbs) per week over the last ten months. That totals 25.5kg, so my youth might be a factor, but for anyone my age or younger, lose it slowly and you'll be fine.


**11. If you can't sell a supplement, weight loss supplements and exercise machines. Some worked, none I stuck to for more than a few months at a time. I've found keto so easy to stick to, with such predictable results over the long term, AND with spending so little money, it really infuriates me to see sharks and low-lives trying to exploit the fat and confused, and use their misery to grind money out of them. 

**12. Keep calm and Keto on**. It's really just excellent advice--your health and personal well being is more important than somebody else's paranoia or stupid opinions, so take advantage of it.

I want to close with a quote; it's from British Economist John Maynard Keynes

**""Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally""**

The point of a keto diet is to be in ketosis - what this means is that your body is breaking down fat at such a rate that there are ketones in your bloodstream. This happens after fasting

It's also important to note that your body burns whatever fuel is available - glucose, alcohol. Whatever there is more of is what it burns more (which is why alcohol ""pauses"" ketosis, your body will burn up the alcohol first). 

Ketostix will measure excess ketones that are in your urine. However they are not the be all and end all of being in ketosis. If you are using all your ketones for energy

One of the goals of the keto diet is being ""keto adapted"". This means that your body is primed for functioning with very little glucose. Different enzymes are involved for breaking down fat than breaking down glucose. When you first enter ketosis, your cells change the way they get energy. It's really amazing all the changes that have to happen internally for keto-adaptation to happen. It's like you can't just put diesel into a regular car engine and expect everything to work smoothly. 

Once you are keto-adapted (which can take a few weeks to a month depending on the person), you carry less excess water. You're able to function well - lots of energy, you can exercise, lift, build up endurance etc. 

When you're keto adapted and get an ""overdose"" of carbs (more than your body needs at the time) different things happen. First, insulin rises, which can affect other hormone levels as well. While your body processes the carbs, you are not burning ketones. Once the glucose is dealt with, you will go back into ketosis. When you're keto adapted, this doesn't take long because you already have the enzymes and are ""primed"" to use fat for energy. 

When you're starting keto, sugar will will still take precedence over fat for fuel (because excess blood sugar is fatal and so your body *needs* to handle the sugar first). 

If your goal is weight loss, but some people find the boost helpful depending on their goals (Peter Attia has said he doesn't use any carbs unless he is cycling more than 3 hrs, so if you're under that, going carb free is at the very least possible). Even building muscle while in ketosis is possible, just ask those over at /r/ketogains

1370356557.0,1fniuu,[NSV] My doc just said this.,bavorec,541,68,107,"So I'm on keto since mid January and I'm very happy with my progress. My wife was quite supportive in the beginning but since some time she's bugging me to eat fruit because vitamins and stuff... I told her all about vitamins in fruit and how I get enough vitamins through veggies and my daily vitamin pill but she doesn't listen and wants me to have my blood tested. You probably already see where this is going...
Today we had a visit at the doc because of a minor thing that she has (don't worry she's fine) and when her examination was done she said ""why don't you ask the doc about this diet of yours?"". So I tell him that I'm on low carb, fruit, potatoes and whatnot. I tell him that I lost quite some fat and that I feel fitter and better then ever. He says ""Listen I know what you are doing. You can quote me on this. Keep it up. This is the best thing that you can do for yourself. Know that there are no essential sugars. Essential as in needed for the human body. There is no such thing as an essential sugar or carb. Fat, amino acid, protein - all essential, but not sugar. If you want it we can test your blood so that your wife is happy but I don't see a reason for that.""
I'm really curious as to how she will treat my diet after this.
So if you need another argument for your diet it's this - sugar and carbs are not essential while fat

So heres a list of quick, and/or who dont have full control over their kitchens, their fridges, and their shopping lists.

**Breakfasts**

* 2 eggs: Fryed or however you prefer

* Cream cheese wrapped in sandwitch meat. Ham

* Tuna salad. A can of tuna

* Nuts and dairy. Mix nuts of almost whatever kind, or cream cheese. (Caution: some yogurt and cottage cheese are not keto friendly, even those that are are just barely acceptable)

(have some lettuce or spinach with any/all of these breakfasts)

**Lunches**

* ""BLT salad"". Exactly what it sounds like.

* Chef's salad. Hardboiled eggs

* Hotdog weiners (boiled, even microwaved) on a bed of greens (Caution: some hotdogs arent keto friendly. In general the better quality ones have the least carbs. I like the ones stuffed with cheese ^.^ )

**Dinners**

* Taco salad. Cook some groundbeef, and find some sourcream.

* Bun-less burgers. Cook (BBQ or frying pan) frozen burger patty(s)

* Frozen veggies (streamed, or however), or any kind of meat.

* Chicken ceasar salad. Chicken (I use leftover boneless chicken breasts baked in the oven), or make your own).

**Dessert**

* A couple of berrys

3) **Top Posts** (Motivation!)

I like to browse the top posts in r/Keto here from time to time, look [here](http://i.imgur.com/HVKLl.png) for a how-to or go straight to the [top posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/top/)). The top posts here are highly upvoted before/after transformations from our own users.

I personally find these a billion times more motivating than posting and asking folks here to motivate me. You have to seek your own motivation--no one here can talk it into you. I personally find motivation in the accomplishments of others

Spend some time looking through the photos and reading the stories of our users who have lost weight and changed their lives eating Ketogenically. (Is that a word? I'm going with yes.) 


4) **The Seester Subs**

Keto has plenty of other related subs that may help you in what you're looking for. Don't eat meat? Try /r/VegetarianKeto. Want to share and find great keto recipes? Try /r/KetoRecipes. The full list can be found on the right sidebar. Speaking of sidebar...

* Language/location-specific subreddits in sidebar


5) **The Sidebar**

The sidebar is full of links that may not otherwise be found in the FAQ. Go ahead and scroll on down. You'll see:

* The list of sister subs
* Some general Meta info on posting in r/Keto (also heed!)
* The Useful Links section full of
* Sites that r/Keto members have made

* The Moderators

**Using these resources before posting questions help keep the subreddit nice and neat

*Happy Ketoing!*

**Edit:** Sorry about links not working

**Edit 2:** It seems like this post has sparked some debate, and I encourage you to ask anything and everything!** I often see the same questions posted daily (""Anyone on MFP?"", ""Can I eat X food?"", etc) and those questions are answered often. There is a MFP thread with names added daily, and plenty of resources listed in the FAQ to find out what foods are ""acceptable"" on Keto.

* keto is not a magic bullet. For most healthy people, hormone imbalances, PCOS, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and other health issues, keto can have other benefits, but the weight loss isn't magic. 

* It's normal and healthy to lose 1-2lbs a week

* ""Stalls"" are normal. It takes time for your body to adjust to weight loss, not like mathematics. Sometimes people lose in [wooshes](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/of-whooshes-and-squishy-fat.html), sometimes people lose more steadily. Hormones, sleep, diet, water retention, stress all play a factor. If you're at the same weight for more than 3 weeks and no other changes (like measurements) are happening, keep calm and keto on. 

* water retention happens. Diet, activity, hormones and a host of other things can affect how much water you've got. 3-10lbs fluctuation is within a normal range. So if you lost 2lbs of fat but are holding on to 4lbs of water, the scale won't move. Keep calm and keto on, and start taking measurements. 

* protein is not the enemy. While there is some debate over how much protein you need, too much protein can be a problem, but too much is a whole lot of protein. Follow the guidelines in the keto calculator, you'll be fine. 

* Diet makes you lose weight, take care of your body. If you're unsure of where to start, talk with your doctor. If you have physical conditions, talk to a physiotherapist or a trainer. 

* Freestyle keto (not tracking) is possible, if you eat for any reason other than being hungry, or if you aren't losing as much weight as you think you should, track your food. I'm not saying calories in/calories out is a perfect formula (because it's not, biology works like biology, not like math), but it is easier for your body to use dietary energy than it is to use stored fat, you will generally not be losing fat.

Some Background:

-I am a long-time (~3 year) redditor who mostly lurked by had decent karma on my old /u/.

-I started Keto after seeing a r/keto post cross-listed somewhere else and was AMAZED at what I saw on r/keto. I felt ""this is exactly what I have been looking for! this is a way that I can make the big weight loss change I know I want to do

-The reason I had never seen it is simply that nobody seems to talk about or be supportive of the Ketogenic Diet. Sure Adkins and South Beach are popular and people all know that some people do a ""low carb"" diet. But when I explain Keto to people they think I'm crazy

-Getting a delicious cookbook to the public will show the world (and all your worried parents, healthier, thinner, life.

-I have only been doing keto a week but I am always full, I want to be in this for the long run, and even after just a week, I feel that the food (as I don't have a lot of money to spend on non-bulk and expensive items) is getting repetitive.

-Before Keto

-THere are already tons of delicious recipes on r/ketorecipes.

-SO, AND COMPLETE A COMPLETE COOKBOOK FOR KETOGENIC EATERS THAT COVERS:
-Everyday Breakfasts
-Everyday Lunches
-Everyday Dinners
-Everyday Snacks
-Special Desserts (Birthday Cake
-A Keto Thanksgiving Meal
-A Keto Christmas Ham Dinner
-A Keto Passover Sedar (oy)
-We can consider more as we go on

Feel free to get me On KetoChat

I started keto for the wrong reasons. I was angry. Angry at the world and not at myself. A broken misguided heart and a wallowing depression. My motivation was a Shakespearean quote ""Anger is my Meat

I stumbled upon /R/keto via a random post on the front page

It started with a horrible stomach virus the weekend after discovering r/Keto. I spent the weekend in my shorts, especially  using a stomach virus to help totally cleanse my system.

And so I started. I donated my entire pantry, ramen, cookies, chips, everything. Donated it all and started totally fresh. Avoided anything with a carb in it. ended up relying on Sardines and farmers cheese for a go-to snack. 3 egg omlettes in the morning, with bacon, a salad with grilled chicken and Ken's Bleu Cheese dressing for lunch

I proudly admit that i've never cheated, drank 2 gallons of water a day. and the weight came off.  I had a plan too. Every plateau hit, led to changing it up just slightly. enough to get me out of it. 

First was cutting out carbs completely. (&lt;20g / day)
next was following the ratios
followed by calorie counting (&lt;2500/day)
followed by Intermittent Fasting 

The intermittent fasting was the greatest challenge. I needed to break the bad habits I had accrued over the years, eating for the sake of eating because it was 8am, 12pm, 6pm. I needed to reteach myself. To eat when I was truly hungry. and I found it was easy once you got used to it. True hunger comes from the back of the jowls, not a grumbly tummy.  

I kept that up, and joined up with KetoChat. A wonderful support system can be found there if you talk to the right folks. My handle was 'Twisted' and I still head over there on occasion.

1358553735.0,16ujle,6 months ago my doctor advised me not to do keto...,trojanguy,479,83,113,"I'm about 6'0"" and was 204 lbs at the time. I'd heard about keto at the very end of June, and she thought a diet without fruit could never be healthy. I agreed to see a doctor before starting the diet to make sure there was nothing I should be worried about.

A few days later, and eat fewer calories. Basically the standard ""how to lose weight"" ideas. I tried explaining about some of the research I'd read regarding keto, but he dismissed it as a ""fad diet"" like Atkins, South Beach, etc. and advised me not to do it. He did agree to have me take a blood test to check my lipid profile and fasting glucose levels, then see him again in 6 months.

Skip ahead a couple days and my blood test results come in. My cholesterol is 266, and calculated LDL is 200. My tri/HDL ratio (which I learned here on /r/keto should ideally be 2 or lower to minimize heart attack risk) was 3.2. Overall, I'd say it looked pretty bad. This was somewhat deflating because I figured if I shared this information with my wife, she'd be even more against me trying a ketogenic diet out. Now, I wouldn't say I **lied** to my wife about my doctor's advice nor my blood test results, but it's fair to say I diminished their significance when discussing them. In the end, we agreed that I'd try keto for a month and re-evaluate things then.

3 months later I was still doing keto. I'd lost 30 lbs and was feeling pretty darn great. A month or so into the diet I'd also figured out how to work in two or three 1-hour gym sessions a week, etc). I emailed my doctor and explained to him that I had lost a fair amount of weight since my visit 3 months ago, and I'd like to get a blood test before the 6 month mark to make sure my diet wasn't adversely affecting my body internally. He ordered one, and a few days later I found that not only had I lost weight, but my cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, I decide to stick with keto and see where it takes me.

I hit the 6 month mark with keto around January 11, but I feel better and I have to believe that I'm at much lower risk of heart attack and type 2 diabetes. A couple of days ago I had my follow-up appointment with the doctor and got nothing but ""atta boys"" from him. He didn't ask me for specifics about how I lost the weight, so I'm a bit worried that he still thinks that a ketogenic diet is bad and will continue to warn other patients against it, so I'm considering emailing him to give him a little detail about my 6 month journey. Regardless, I'm happy to say that keto has worked out great for me, and I'm really glad that **in this particular case** I didn't listen to my doctor's advice.

**To recap:** 

Holee cow. Not only am I wearing a swimsuit...I'm wearing a swimsuit on the internet. I have r/keto

I'm a 5'11 female that has been eating Keto for the last 6 months or so. I was on a high-carb crazy train to deal with work and life stress. I stopped weighing myself at 185 so I'm not sure how heavy I was when I started with a keto diet. 

Within three months of keto I got down to my current weight of 158 or so. In early January I began light weightlifting and running. In early February I started Crossfit 2x per week. I eat about 30 grams of carbs a day and don't count calories. 

For the last three months I haven't really seen my weight change

I've tried low carb diets before but was not nearly as successful as I've been after educating myself here at r/keto. I attribute my success largely to two things: 

1. In the past
2. Almond flour! Flax meal! Stevia! Riced cauliflower!! Coconut oil!!! There are so many low-carb friendly foods that I didn't know about 5 years ago. They make cooking on keto interesting (and more importantly

**TL;DR Lost 30lbs




**Edit:** A few folks have asked if I have any advice for someone that's new to keto. Adding it here: 

There's a good chance you will feel HORRIBLE for a few days, my keto flu was so extreme that I could hardly get out of bed, and I actually barfed in the shower. :(

Also

Oven bacon WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND as you get started. I just cover a baking sheet in tinfoil, and then I have bacon waiting for me when I get out. It's pretty dreamy.

I'd also say don't get caught up in weighing yourself day to day. Your weight will fluctuate and it doesn't actually mean much. Find some really tight clothing

I started my journey nearly 4 and a half years ago.  I was always a fat kid

I started by eating breakfast everyday, bike, and even do a little weight training.

One day, I just put weight back on.  By NYE 2011, I was back up to 275.  I made a resolution to do something about it again in 2012.

And I did.  I tried the same weight loss strategy I had tried 3 years prior.  And I only lost 30 pounds.  It was disappointing.  I couldn't even get myself as low as I had previously.  I was also training for a Century.

Then I discovered this subreddit.  It was about a month before that 100 mile ride.  I decided I would start Keto the day after that ride.  Best decision I've ever made.

I've never felt so good.  Never had so much energy.  And the weight just fell away.  I was also fortunate.  Never had the keto-flu.  Never felt weaker.  I do often have to get more salt into my diet though ;)

Many thanks for those of you that have not taken this post personally. I love that you're changing yourself for the better.

Initially, unlike before. This first, noticeable change became this huge boost in the confidence I had for keto. Talk is talk, pictures are pictures, but until YOU experience that change, and realize YOU are going to effect your end result, you wont believe it. 

I began to subsidize the diet with exercise. By two months in I was down around 30 pounds. the more you see change, I was in shape, but never cut. The only reason I'm here now is because this whole thing works. Its not some crazy pseudo-science. I despise that shit as a scientist, so I would never espouse that babble without the facts. 

But this, no problems with digestion. As an added aside not having all the sugars in my mouth changes the local environment, you'll see. Think of it as a surprise. 

I implore anyone, oh a bagel? No thanks I'm fine. 

Happy baconing.

Calm down, that matters.

Let's say you've been ketoing for a month. You've lost 5 or 10 or 20 pounds, when calculated, turns out to be 300g of carbs. You start to feel a little sick or hyper or sleepy and you realize your mistake. You're up all night with a stomach ache. You feel like you have the flu. Or maybe you just wake up and find you've gained a bunch of water weight.

So the next morning, and you keto on. You remember the carb meal fondly or distainfully, it doesn't matter, but you *do* remember that it was a one time thing that was an accident. You put it behind you. The water weight goes away in a matter of days, and you've lost none of your progress. You resume losing and you feel better again.


If you're doing keto because you're overweight, it snuck up on you, slowly. So slowly that you didn't think anything of it when your pant size crept up from an 8 to a 16 or a 34"" to a 46"". 

Losing weight is just the same in reverse. You won't lose 50 pounds overnight. You will lose what you need to over the course of months or years. A single day will be but a tiny drop in the bucket. It's a lifestyle. It's an everyday habit that gives you slow but noticeable results.

Just remember - keep calm and keto on.",self,t5_2rske,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rgxpa/psa_one_carby_mistake_will_not_kill_you_its_just/

(Go ahead and check

So coming back from vacation and telling us about all the ~~delicious~~ horrible food you ate

Yes, you don't need to justify it, you don't need to tell us how much better you feel with/without cheat days. If you mess up and feel bad, then do better tomorrow. If you plan on eating whatever the hell you want on weekends, go ahead and do it. 

This forum is for talking about being on a ketogenic diet, you might be able to handle it, but there are some here who can't, be respectful of that. 

Also, so the reports help us keep things tidy. 

Finally, you'll find all the info you need. 


EDIT: the reasoning behind the ""no cheating posts""

&gt;since the idea of keto is to lose weight and gain control over insulin levels by restricting carbohydrates

* ""Guys I'm going on a cruise
* ""Guys it was my birthday and i had a huge cake and fries and all the thigns and now i'm back did you miss me"" is a no
* ""Is eating low carb torillas ok/worth it"" is a great topic
* ""I cheated and it was worth it and here's why it's ok"" is not

[Before it all started. Shirtless and bulging.](http://imgur.com/zed9Njk)

Before the diet I was at a staggering 200 pounds (5’11). Now mind you that some here started at 300-400-500 pounds. It is a good display at how this diet works for a wide range of individuals, that a calorie is a calorie and breakfast is vital to human health, the carbs came easy. How about a nice glass of orange juice for breakfast, followed by a piece of whole wheat bread with 100% fruit jam? Surely a responsible breakfast when following the rest of the crowd that babbles for human health. Well, if we modestly calculate the carb count we get over 60 grams of carbohydrates, unrefined, easily metabolized and nice wake up call to your pancreas. This is not a problem for the average individual if their paradigm favours the infallible laws of thermodynamics. Calorie wise, desperate to find a way to shed off the pounds that have been accumulating over the years. We are ordinary people

After discovering this subreddit by the nice folks of r/loseit, low-carb, high exercise ketoing. My goal was to lose 30 pounds in two months, and I lost 40. 
How did I do it?

[Some progress back in June-July 2012

I set a strict 1500 calorie diet for the first month, oft times accidentally fasting for the entire day. Diet sodas and sweeteners were allowed, to maintain my sanity after the sudden diet change. Coffee (2 cream) was a lifesaver, pushing my hunger pangs to much, much later. I did not suffer from a keto flu or maybe I just didn’t differentiate the horrible condition my digestive system was before the change. What I blamed on “lactose intolerance” was just not being healthy. Interestingly enough, my “intolerance” to lactose magically disappeared after those two months. Headaches are now rarities, early mornings less painful

[Shirtless

I would run every two or three days, exercise is a good component for self-improvement and general fitness. Without exercise, you might lose a lot of weight, but I can assure you that muscle can be lost on the ketogenic diet. So keep yourself busy. 

[Back from a run](http://imgur.com/UEkilZQ)

After losing forty pounds it was like being reborn. People don’t recognize you anymore; it’s like a brand new start. Going back to college and talking to old classmates who double-take when they see you feels great. The number of NSVs are uncountable and you get noticed by curious, might I remind you the wonderful effects sexual hormones, uninhibited by insulin, manifests onto an individual’s life. The workouts are fiercer, taken as a challenge rather than a burden. Sex, to keep it relatively short, is amazing and the love of my life is very welcome at the idea of having more of it...when she gets back from England.
 
With a final college course on writing a 10-15 page paper on any subject of choice led me to write an essay on the leading causes of obesity in the western world. Gary Taubes was my main source and I had the privilege to read both of his books on nutrition, but very much so with white Europeans.

My prof was very much interested. As an Irishman who ate potatoes all his life and seen the decline in physical labour, for what you are proposing is that you have found the Holy Grail!” I did, sir. I did.  

One year has passed by and I have kept the same weight

Previously to /r/keto I was a reddit lurker so I started this account to interact with the community. I started by posting pictures of my food on imgur and one day someone asked if I had the recipes on a blog somewhere.  Being in grad school with a decent amount of free time

I ended up losing a total of 60 lbs over the course of the diet!  I've met a lot of cool people and hopefully helped others at the same time.

**Here are some NSVs:**

* Went from an XL to a medium
* Size 40 pants to 33/34
* Obese to normal BMI
* Did a 50 mile bike race
* Biked over 1000 miles since starting the diet
* No longer get winded walking to my office from the car
* Started browsing /r/malefashionadvice and totally reworked my wardrobe

And now the obligatory **Progress Pictures**: [Caveman Keto before and after the keto transformation](http://imgur.com/a/EgVdX)

I've taken other progress pics with more skin throughout the journey but I'm not sure I'm ready to post them yet. Also

**Top Ten Caveman Keto recipes (Based on user traffic):**

I've been a regular subber of /r/Keto and other related subreddits for a while now

Here's how you can utilize Reddit functions to get the best out of r/Keto:


1) **Read the FAQ!**

This one is simple. Don't just know it's there: go on and read it. Today. The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto) is a nicely organized source of information put together by mods and users here in r/Keto. In the FAQ

* a [tl;dr](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#TLDR) of the Ketogenic diet basics
* Further information about [what may/may not be eaten](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#TheStandardApproach)
* (My favorite) A fantastic list of [resources](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Resources) to help you find answers to your keto-based questions.
* A ton more information you won't know unless you read it


2) **The Search Function**

If your question has not been answered by the FAQ

*Question: What are your favorite Thanksgiving recipes?*

We will conduct a few searches confined to r/Keto using keywords. [Here's how to](http://i.imgur.com/VPE1h.png).

* Keyword search: [Thanksgiving](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=Thanksgiving&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- This shows 160 threads pertaining to Thanksgiving.

* Keyword search: [Pumpkin pie](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=pumpkin+pie&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) -- 30 threads relating to Pumpkin and Pumpkin pie.

* Keyword search: [Turkey](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=turkey&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) -- 440 results all about turkey.

* Also try the FAQ's list of [common r/Keto searches](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#CommonrketoSearches)

3) **Top Posts** (Motivation!)

I like to browse the top posts in r/Keto here from time to time, look [here](http://i.imgur.com/HVKLl.png) for a how-to or go straight to the [top posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/top/)). The top posts here are highly upvoted before/after transformations from our own users.

I personally find these a billion times more motivating than posting and asking folks here to motivate me. You have to seek your own motivation--no one here can talk it into you. I personally find motivation in the accomplishments of others

Spend some time looking through the photos and reading the stories of our users who have lost weight and changed their lives eating Ketogenically. (Is that a word? I'm going with yes.) 


4) **The Seester Subs**

Keto has plenty of other related subs that may help you in what you're looking for. Don't eat meat? Try /r/VegetarianKeto. Want to share and find great keto recipes? Try /r/KetoRecipes. The full list can be found on the right sidebar. Speaking of sidebar...

People are asking me about food and what I did. Several of my recipes are found here in r/Keto if you look back about a year- who has time for that?! I'm a vegetarian- so this was all VegKeto.

Staple foods/weekly shopping:

Olives

Nuts

Kimchi

Pickles

String Cheese

Veggie Burgers

Heavy Cream

Eggs

Veggie breakfast meats


Recipes: These are not scientific- I am not good at quickly throwing down recipes- you can PM me if you want more detail.


Keto Cheese Soup (a recipe found on here that is someone else's idea but I can't find to credit): 1/2- 1 stick of butter melted in a pan with 1 cup of heavy cream. About 1 cup of cheese of choice (I used cheddar mostly). Melt it together until it becomes soup. For variation

Mashed Cauliflower: Head of cauliflower cooked and then blended with heavy cream and cheese- all to taste preference. Add spices of choice- I like cayenne. 

Fried Tofu: Craptons of butter in a skillet. Extra firm tofu sliced 1/2 inch thick or less. Fry tofu on medium until crispy and then flip. Take off pan and coat in buffalo sauce

Peanut butter cheesecake mess: However much cream cheese you want mixed with a bit of splenda and vanilla extract (to taste). Slather peanut butter on top. Cram it in your face. 


Exercise: During the summer, you have to refuel somehow.

I'm 5""7 and went from 187 pounds to 155 in 3 and a half month.

I never really counted calories or anything like that. For breakfast I usually had some cheese or some cucumber slices with cream cheese on top and for lunch I went very light with just some cheese and maybe a small smoked 95%+ meat sausage.
After about 5-6 weeks I felt very little hunger during the day (despite me being a real muncher before doing keto) and often times skipped breakfast or lunch
One thing I must note is that I felt more energetic while doing keto than I've felt in many years before.

As for excercise I tried to take a detour to make my walk to the bus each morning a few extra miles

I got a lot of inspiration from this subreddit and I hope this can contribute somehow with some inspirations for food :)

Feel free to ask me about any recipes (or anything else) but I think most of the recipes are self explanatory just from the pictures

The yellow sauce you see on some of the pictures are either store bought bernaise sauce (1g carb per serving) or the following butter sauce:

* heavy cream
* butter
* lemon juice and chopped dill or parsely for fish OR very little lemon juice and ground pepper + what's on your mind for meat
* salt to taste

Reduce the cream to about 50-70% of it's original volume in a sauce pan

Please understand that I LOVED keto food too, a french fry, or potato chip. One french fry turned into two, then I found myself eating carbs and the same ratio as I was eating keto food before I knew it. On keto, I could eat a ton of veggies and meats which was great, but that 'portion mindset' transitioned over when I slowly relapsed. I gained it all back and tons more. 

I spent the last 7 months losing all the weight again through simple calorie counting. At one point I ate fast food for a month and lost 20lbs. But guess what? I still love and eat Keto food! I may not be in ketosis

Why I failed:

The simple mindset of feeling restricted from certain foods was what caused me to relapse after the initial excitement (6 months in) wore off. Now that I have learned to properly manage my calories

It is so often stated around here that calorie counting can be ignored, or 10 years down the road.

From my heaviest, now down to 155). I've never felt more secure and confident in my body and everything it is capable of. Yoga, hiking, running, swimming, dancing; I love the feeling of my body in motion without the extra strain once attached to it. My family in friends who haven't seen me in a few months consistently have the same reaction: ""You look amazing, how did you do it?""



The past two months, it's inspirational, but when it came to changing his diet, he was upset to say the least. My former Navy Lieutenant Commander, 6-inch-long-grey-beard-wearing, Harley-riding father was going to have to stop the boozing and barbecuing that made his motorcycle club meetings feel like family dinners. My dad and I had a distant relationship at best, he being strict and logical where I was creative and spontaneous, so why not give it a try? I explained that he didn't have to calorie count unless he really wanted to



He's been on keto with me ever since. The first week's worth of meals impressed him so much, my dad and I started eating together... AT A DINNER TABLE. After a whole lifetime of sitting by myself in front of the TV while I ate dinner, it was so amazing to enjoy a conversation and really take in the effort of my labor instead of mindlessly shoving food in my mouth alone. My dad doesn't talk about the pain from the procedures and the surgeries, but he does talk about just about everything else. I get to hear his views on politics and science, things he doesn't share with his club brothers or my mom. We talk about our jobs and music-- I never thought an engineer who loves classic rock and a waitress who loves EDM could relate so well. After dinner, we watch movies and play guitar together. Right now we're learning Put Your Lights On by Santana, one of his favorite songs of all time.



My mom and sister are a bit more reserved than my father and I

I have struggled with my weight for years, and said to myself, ""that's too much.""  I poked around at diets, and settled on Keto, because it seemed to fit with what I liked to eat, and what I could give up.  And the weight started to come off.

It was hard to stick to sometimes, because every day I would wake up, weigh myself, and know if what I did yesterday was good, or if I screwed up.  For the first few months, all I had to to was change what I ate, and weight loss just seemed to happen.  Then I started to hit plateaus, and weight started coming off again; slowly

I started running.  I was terrible at it (I still am)

I went from an XL to a Small or Medium in shirts

The first picture is from a backpacking trip I took with my sister.  I was horrendously out of shape for it, and wanted to share.

Thanks to everyone for posting the recipes and keeping the updates flowing.  It certainly has helped to see people making progress.

My starting weight was 222.2.  I'm probably about 1/3 of the way to where I *should* be, and watch the muscles grow :)

By the way, and I like turning the strips to pink... I think these rituals help keep me on-task.

- i have dropped 40 pounds from my all-time high.

- i sized down from from a 12/14 to a 6/8.

- i lost a cup size. D:

- i went down a shoe size.

- i got laid! by pretty good-looking dudes

- i feel confident enough to go out more often. no more nights sitting alone in my room

- i made my little asian mother cry with pride (and possibly relief). she has now made it her personal mission to buy me lots of new clothes now that i'm no longer creeping towards plus sizes.

- i cook less than i ever have before

- the staff at jimmy john's know me on sight. every time i walk in during lunch
MIMIIIIII! UNNNNWIIIIIIIIICH!""

- i also eat at wingstop far more than i'd like to admit. people tell me i'm going to become massive if i continue to devour chicken wings like i'm a middle-aged man watching football in my living room. but i keep getting smaller

- i have converted at least 3 people to the keto lifestyle. am i a ketovangelist now?

- i let people take full-body photos of me without being filled with self-loathing and paranoia.

- i have gained a new appreciation for certain foods i did not used to like: spinach

and most importantly

- i no longer refer to myself as a fat girl.

this subreddit has (with absolutely no exaggeration) changed my life and my relationship with food. i was so ridiculously skeptical the first time i came across keto

Before I knew it I found myself in the early afternoon on nothing but that breakfast bar. No fat, I was pissing like a racehorse and drinking like a fish. My strips couldn't get any more purple, my energy is abundant and pounds are starting to slip off however I was completely unprepared for what happened next. I began feeling strangely lightheaded and disorientated, I wasn't exactly hungry but I instinctively knew I had to eat and eat fast. Cue a frantic dash back to the car loading up the spoils of the grocery war and then the surreal moment itself. With my horrified wife in the seat beside me and my baby son sleeping in the back I preceded to eat a full rotisserie chicken with my bare hands.

Letting each piece of skin and flesh melt in my mouth as the fat ran down my cheeks I was the poster boy for gluttony and like a barbarian warrior feasting on the spoils of war I was filled with both a sense of achievement and shame for what I had done. For a few raging minutes of savagery the manners instilled in me by my dear mother were cast aside as I tore the carcass asunder.

I can honestly say following that frantic feeding session

Think of your favorite store brand of jerky. Jack Links... Wild Bills

NO. Spit that shit out. Look at the back of that package. Look at all those chemicals. And look at that beef!! its soo.. BLECH. 
IT'S SOYLENT GREEN!!! (Ok

Now

Read on..
if not.. go enjoy your nasty overpriced meat chips. Be careful to not choke on the ""do not eat"" packet they hide in there. Yes

First thing you need to do.

Call your local butcher

Tell them you need 5 lbs. (you can do less. 5 lbs is a decent amount and not too much) of lean roast for jerky. If they ask you what kind, or flank. Just make sure it is lean. Why? I know.. we love fat on keto. Sometimes it is inevitable and there will be fat in your cut. It's ok. But here is the thing. Fat in jerky makes it go rancid. When I get fatty pieces I keep those in the fridge, and eat them first. And also to be honest, I think they are really really tasty morsels. 

Anyway

Ok

This is for 5 lbs.... 

6 tablespoons of onion powder.
3 cups Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup soy sauce (more if you like it salty)
3/4 of a packet of dry italian dressing mix
Garlic powder


Now, all that marinade and throw it in a gallon zip lock bag. Sip that beer as you do this to assert your manhood in jerky making. Feel free to mix up the ratios to your liking. I will make the marinade separate and dip my finger in that shit to taste test. Then go nuts with a straw like a newly dumped frat girl on a pint of Ben and Jerry's

Anyway. Throw that in the fridge for 24 hours MINIMUM..

Also don't forget to occasionally during the time to swish things around in the bag so everything gets all nice and marinated. No swishing means jerky with dull

Ok, you're ready to call in sick because, well ... fuck responsibility right? Besides, we need this time to babysit our meat curtains. 

So, dont ring the meat out like a washcloth, but try to get as much of the moisture off as possible. I like to run the meat between two fingers before I put it on the rack. And yes, I know.. I have to clean my oven. Everytime I put it on the clean setting it smokes like a chimney and I have to abort the cleaning cycle like an out of wedlock fetus.

Shit

Anyway. Now

We want to leave that door open 1/8th of the way I prop mine open with a can of beans. Why? Well, it is to let the moisture out... we ARE drying this meat out, and not cooking it.. right?)

Set your oven to the lowest possible setting. 150-180 if you can.. 200 and over.. you can do it

and wait..

and wait..

And then the only question you should have.

How do I know when it is done?

Well

Also

If it gets too dry

Now take your jerky.. hold it up

And then plan on making another batch. This shit doesn't last long. I always seem to lose mine in other peoples stomachs.

I have suffered from severe stomach pains for the last 5 years. It got to the point where i was vomiting many times a day and vomiting up  blood. I tried different ways of eating that the doctors would suggest to me, everyday felt like a battle just to be able to get up and more around. 

I lost my job due to being sick

When I stumbled across this subreddit and started to read a little but about it I became intrigued and started to read as much as I could. I quickly decided that I would give it a try

Now onto more of less how I started and still continue with my way of eating today. 

1st) The day I started I decided I would go about this not a day at a time but a week at a time. I would prepare my dinners for the week along with lunch. So if i was going to have chicken I would make enough chicken for the whole week. I already had a foodsaver so it worked out well for me. Breakfast was and has been 3 eggs and 4 sausage links. Its 500 cals for the meal and very filling.

2nd)Lunches would always be what i was going to have for dinner that night

3rd) Dinner would be the same for me for a week, zucchini. 

Now I would always eat when i first started until I was full. No more no less. Snacks are always either pork rinds

I can answer any questions anyone might have for me.

So

And then I just quit.

I honestly don't even know why I did.  I just... stopped.  And then the weight came back

And I ended up

I started back on the 18th

Seriously....Keto is magic.

For everyone out there who is thinking up excuses about why not to start.... just do it.  

I'm not gonna lie - it's (about) one week of hell.  Even if you are really careful to avoid Keto flu by keeping your electrolytes up (I salted the hell out of everything I ate and drank a TON of water)

There were a few moments last week where I could have stabbed a kitten for a doughnut.

It doesn't help that I'm a stay-at-home mom - I'm handing out crackers and cookies and cutting apples and oranges all day long

For those of you like me with families who aren't conforming, but EAT.  Then eat some more.  And then some more.  Ignore your calories that first week or two and only pay attention to the carbs, and stuff yourself full of Keto foods.  It's SO much easier to say not to carbs if you're stuffed to the gills with steak and cheese and whatnot.  You'll eat less than you think.

Once you get your rhythm you can pay attention to the calories.... but it'll actually come easy by that point.  One of the weird side effects of this diet is the lack of hunger.    I mean

And that's the beauty of Keto - it teaches you to figure out the difference between hunger and cravings.

I know I sound kind of preachy for someone who is still relatively new at this, I loved my life, but I just hated what I had become.  I hated that I was that fat, stereotypical American mom - the kind they make fun of over in Europe, you know?  I felt disgusting.

And here we are, I'm still wearing the same shirts... but I feel sexy because I feel powerful (confident?) about how heading in the right direction, if that makes sense.  

On a side note

I look forward to sharing updated photos with you all.

Also, y'all.  Jump back on the ""treat your body right"" train.  It feels good :)

**TL;DR:  Keto works.  DUH.**

[This article](https://www.mayoclinic.com/health/artificial-sweeteners/MY00073) from the Mayo Clinic gives a good broad overview of the different types of artificial sweeteners.  It also points to the root of the ""fake sugar = cancer"" myth.  Back in the 70s

[Here is an article](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/are-artificial-sweeteners-safe/) that spicifically details the safety of aspartame.  It also debunks some of the more popular myths about the substance.  The *only* exception is if you have a genetic condition called [phenylketonuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria).  If you have PKU, and as they must also avoid meat, nuts, and dairy, they're almost certainly not doing keto in the first place.

[This section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose#Safety_studies) of the wikipedia article on sucralose links to several of the over 100 human and animal studies showing the sweetener to be safe.  Even the National Cancer Institute

There are a few people still claiming artificial sweeteners are dangerous, and snake oil supplements.  Nearly all internet FUD about sucralose links back to this guy, as I'm sure was his original intent.  Nothing like using fear to sell your products.  He's been [thoroughly debunked](http://kentuckychemistry.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/on-the-similarities-between-sucralose-and-ddt/) by the legitimate scientific community.

I've submitted many a food porn and posts containing random rants.  I've submitted blood test results.  But it's finally time to post some pictures.

Let me drop some back story.  I'm the typical ""big guy all my life"" but started gaining after high school.  I'm sure I topped out at 500lbs in 2011.  I ended up in the hospital with guillain-barre and a pulmonary embolism.  Scary times.  I dropped close to 50 pounds during that ""vacation"" (ha, and gained about 30 pounds before starting Keto.

I created this [album](http://imgur.com/a/UZ0A4) today.  If I ordered the photos correctly... which I hope I did.  I was probably around 450 lbs in the first photo

My weight loss has come from diet.  I've restricted calories on most days to 1200-1800 (sometimes as low as 1000).  I had great success with 16/8 and 20/4 mixed intermittent fasting.  I've also done a 3 day fat fast

I was thinking about the past few years the other day, most) of my meals into MFP for the last 2+ years. 

I started being concious about what I ate when I was 265lbs, and start to feel better about myself. I didn't concern myself with protein or carbs, and adhered to the typical ""low fat, low cal"" way of thought that the media/food industry basically forces on everyone. 

Well, and I lost weight fast. I was at my lightest two winters ago, when I was 155-160lbs. It was far, far too much (for contrast, I'm sitting at 185lbs right now, and I feel great.) 

I looked back on myfitnesspal to see the average of carbohydrates/fats/proteins I was eating daily at this point, only 50-100g of proteins, and on some days, as little as 15-30g of protein. My average caloric intake daily at this point was 1700. I wasn't cheating, whatsoever. 

At this point, but I was happy that I was so slender for the first time in my life. I was however, obsessed with food. I wasn't happy with the amount of food I was eating, and it was a constant source of stress and anxiety. 

Fast forward to now. I gained some of that weight back (thankfully..) and evened out at about 185. I was ""skinny fat"" (which I'm still working on.)

It's been 5 weeks into starting keto, or just under. I'm working out 5 days a week, lifting heavy at the gym, doing squats, presses, etc. My body fat percentage is sitting at about 19%, and I'm much more muscular than I've ever been. I've lost 5lbs so far with keto

Here's the best part though. I'm happy with the food I'm eating. 

Really, beating myself up for wanting to go get a snack. I feel healthier. I'm putting more REAL, UNPROCESSED foods into my body. I'm eating vegetables, good fats, quality proteins, and I'm having fun doing it. I'm cooking more. And best of all, if I engorge myself on food (like I did last night. Honestly, I was ravenously hungry after an intense leg routine at the gym.) I don't hate myself for it. I don't wake up bloated, I know.) I just keep calm and Keto on

For the first time since my weightloss journey began

And THAT'S why I enjoy, more enjoyable alternative. 

I hope some reads this and takes something from it. If not

1358968915.0,17501n,[SV] I lost over 100lbs in 6 months. Thanks r/keto!,Killerpeeps,347,49,133,"Before I begin

Back in July I was hanging around 305 lbs while only 17. I was always one of the largest (and tallest) kids in my class for as long as I can remember. I had a pretty bad problem with not only eating tons of the wrong foods

Then one fine morning, and attempted to deal with this immense pain. While it was only temporary it was a scary feeling. I am 17 and already having health problems with my heart. A few weeks prior I had even been diagnosed with a fatty liver. My blood was no different either as my blood pressure and heart rate were completely terrible. That moment in particular though got to me and I knew I needed to change. 

So how did I find Keto? Well one of the Youtubers I watched actually mention Keto in one of his videos a few months before I started the diet. I remember watching it and skimmed back to it. Because Reddit pretty much has a subreddit for everything I also checked Reddit and found this community and decided to join. 
Link to video in question: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-l8MRaWfxs

From there on out the rest was history

[July: 305lbs](http://i.imgur.com/ib09nJM.jpg)

[September: 270lbs](http://i.imgur.com/9kEoiqs.jpg)

[October: 255lbs](http://i.imgur.com/OCW4mYx.jpg)

[January: 203lbs]( http://i.imgur.com/h4ExlZu.jpg)

[Now: 197lbs]( http://i.imgur.com/Uqn8Btu.jpg)

As you can see, you sure as hell helped me along my own journey. My life is totally different than it was 6 months ago and I hope that anyone who is new to keto reading this somehow finds this helpful. As we say in the debate world ""I now stand open for cross examination.""

So what does this have to do with keto?  Well, and medications at the problem?  - - On a side note, this would constitute a paradigm shift if implemented.

So I was astounded when she told me that she had actually just read an article that the A.S.P.E.N. group (the gurus of patient nutrition in all its forms) was researching exactly that: placing septic patients on ketogenic diets!  Just with my limited knowledge I can come up with several reasons that a ketogenic diet might benefit my patients or make my care safer so this has me really excited!  If this research comes out and starts being implemented with positive outcomes this could be the beginning of something huge.

TL:DR The guru's of patient nutrition are researching using keto diets in hospitals to treat a condition with a 50% mortality rate.

I don't even know where to begin and who to thank... Keto has been everything to me

Don't want to go on to long

But here is a few things I did to keep myself whipped up during my journey:

* ate only between 1250-1500 kcal/day 
* never ate my exercise or cardio calories i burned
* counted calories like a mad scientist
* logged everything in MFP to keep myself in line
* measured all food i ate with food scale and measuring spoons
* drank nothing but water and coffee and occasional diet sodas
* walked wherever I went
* play hockey twice a week and gym 1-2 times a week for 5K cardio jogs
* weight-lifting very sombre (but I will have to work on this more now to tone up)

Now that that's out of the way

* 1 week into the Keto diet. I'm firmly in ketosis and I've lost about 10 pounds (primarily water weight, but Altoid's help when I need them before talking to someone. The best part, though, are the things I get to eat: Steak, beef, chicken, cheese, high-fat dressings (Ranch, bacon, sunflower seeds

* Keto Week 2: 350 &gt; 338 - 12 pounds lost, though, so that helps a lot. And even when I do, it's usually something like a cheese stick or a piece of ham and I'm good to go. It's hard to tell for sure, but I think my ""keto-breath"" has gotten better. Drinking a lot of water helps, and hoo boy do I drink a lot of water. Having very little carbs in my system and therefore virtually no glycogen stores means that I don't retain water like I used to, so it's a necessity to drink 4 - 5 liters a day. It also means I'm up a couple times during the night to pee, I'm in a gray area between the very beginning of the diet and what is called being ""keto adapted""

* Keto Week 3: 350 &gt; 332 - 18 pounds lost, but I don't think I'll keep up with that. Looking at myself, I don't think I look much thinner. Maybe a bit in my face and my sides, but nothing dramatic yet. One cool side effect has been forcing myself to be more inventive in the kitchen. Since ingredients are somewhat limited, I've had to find interesting and new ways to create meals and foods that work with this diet. For example, today I made something similar to a cinnamon roll using flax meal. I couldn't believe how fluffy it came out and how delicious it tasted! The next step will be to start incorporating some exercise once it warms up just a bit more. I'd really like to get back into running, biking, and it nearly killed me] again...but that's a ways away. Finally

* Keto Week 4 (1 month!!) - 350 &gt; 325 - 25 lbs lost, of course. Reinventing everything you know about nutrition and finding ways to have some semblance of foods you used to enjoy has been interesting. I've learned to love broccoli and all the different ways you can prepare cauliflower. I've found which dressings do and don't work so well with spinach. Eggs have become my best friend, and I've discovered that you save a lot of money when you buy them in a pack of 3 dozen. I've made ""cinnamon rolls"" out of flax, fake gummy bears, fake sherbet, and found out that cream cheese mixed with cocoa powder and cinnamon with no sweeteners isn't near as good as it sounds. I've had to adapt my way of thinking and ordering meals at restaurants as well as exercise some restraint when those delicious carby appetizers come by. I'm learning to start listening to my body and recognize when it needs food and when I'm just thirsty.

I'm so pleased with the decision I made and the change in lifestyle. It's something that I adapted to quickly and can see sustaining for a long time. I understand that it may not be for everyone

So, questions, and discussion has helped me tremendously. The knowledge base is tremendous and I always point people to the FAQ if they have questions about the diet (it really is an amazing resource).

I can't wait to check in on April 6th. I'm hoping to be under 300 by my 30th birthday (April 15th) and I really feel like I can do it!

For the eating part
For the exercise I was in wrestling this past year and I started the diet right when we started lifting weights. So I attribute a lot of my ""transformation"" (I still have a long way to go) to being dedicated to my diet as well as lifting weights.
Also, i'll either have a shake with heavy whipping cream and unsweetened vanilla almond milk and a table spoon of peanut butter, or I sometimes will also have like 3-4 mcdoubles (without the buns of course). But I won't have these two specialty options for days in a row. (if that makes any sense).

**How did I do it?**
I stuck with the usual: 20-30g of carbohydrates a day.  Mind you, starches, drinks with calories(for 9 months I had nothing but water to drink) etc.  I never used ketostix either, but the telltale signs of keto were more than enough to let me know I was in a state of ketosis.

And this was all diet.  No exercise.

**What have I learned?**
More than anything

I also learned patience

2 months for a change doesn't seem like a lot to me now, 3 months is a small chunk of time to me to dedicate to something to see if I like it.

The trick to dieting for me: preparing excess portions for leftovers.  I need to have prepared food ready to consume or I know I will likely make bad choices.  When I cook chicken

**Where do I go from here?**
Keto on!  I've been hitting the gym hard for the last 6 weeks.  I train weightlifting 3 days a week using Greyskull LP

And before anyone asks, but this is uncharted territory for me so we'll see what happens.

I'd like to thank everyone here at r/keto for being a huge inspiration and help to me in this ongoing journey

That being said

1. [Keto sticks are not an absolute.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#HowcanItellifIminketosis) Some people might never turn them purple. You might be one of those folks so stop worrying!

2. [The scale is not an absolute.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Whatwillmyweightlossprogresslooklike) Just because you're not losing weight it doesn't mean you're not losing inches. Measure yourself weekly. Some weeks neither sets of numbers will move.

3. How bad did you mess up? That can only be answered by [how you choose to continue to eat afterward](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Ischeatingworthit). Most of us have had moments of weakness. It happens. Searching for sympathy when you cheat is not a healthy way to deal with your blunder. You can do this

4. The first week is different for everyone. Some people lose a lot of weight (possibly 10+ lbs)

5. Keto hasn't ""stopped"" working. [Plateaus happen](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#AllaboutPlateaus). Change something - what you're eating, etc. Search for hidden carbs in everything you put in your mouth. That includes cough syrup!

6. Keto flu comes in various shapes and sizes. Fatigue, headaches, etc. [You may get some relief by drinking more water and adding salts and electrolytes.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#Ifeeltiredandlightheaded)

7. By volume, it's not an absolute!) may move more slowly as your body burns off fat and adds muscle.

8. Liquor &gt; Wine &gt; Beer. Also, and yes there are some low carb beers out there. [Tread lightly, because keto might turn you into a cheap drunk](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto#CanIstilldrinkalcoholcoffee).

*MOST IMPORTANTLY*, you've got this!**

* Americano (ETA: there is about 1g carb per espresso shot though)

ETA: There may be some regional differences in the iced teas and iced coffees. Out here in CA

ETA: Be smart about the heavy whipping cream

**Chicken in sauce**

Chop a chicken breast into cubes and simmer in a small amount of chicken stock very gently for 30 minutes. Add a cup of sliced mushrooms and continue to simmer for 5 minutes or so. Stir in two tablespoons of smoked paprika and two tablespoons of hot paprika

Best thing to accompany: cauliflower



**Sole Meunier**

Either coat sole fillet in almond flour or leave plain.

Fry two sole fillets (lightly salt them first) in 1 tsp coconut oil for 2 minutes each side. Then add a lot of butter and when it foams

Then add half a cup of chopped parsley



**Beef Stew**

Take cubes of stewing beef and coat in paprika. Fry a few pieces at a time on a medium heat in coconut oil until just brown. Fry some pancetta/lardons/chopped bacon. Leave the bacon in the pan when just brown and add the beef back to the pan.

Then simmer in beef stock for 2 to 3 hours until the cubes are just falling apart. Add low carb vegetables of choice - I recommend zucchini/courgette and mushrooms and cook for 8 or so minutes more. Remove from the heat and add creme fraiche. Allow to cool a little an add some butter and chopped coriander leaves and finely chopped chilli pepper. Finish with a squeeze of lime and some grated cheddar cheese.



**Meatloaf**

Take one kilo of fatty minced beef and add 250 grams of sliced mushrooms and one grated zucchini/courgette and one egg. Add two tablespoons chopped chilli, one teaspoon cinnamon, two tablespoons dried oregano, one tablespoon salt. Stir very well and place into lined loaf tin and cook in oven on medium heat for an hour. Makes 5 portions which keep for about 5 days sealed in the fridge.",,False,self,False,t3_1799nf

After [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ajeuz/low_budget_keto_is_it_possible/) post about low budget keto, cook over a weekend and freeze them all individually.  I've got about a month's worth of lunches and dinners in this freezer.  It makes my life SO much easier and keeps me on track.  I spend about $130-$140 a month on food and feel like I eat like a queen.  Keep in mind, I live in Canada, our food costs are higher.  

Below are some of the recipes in the freezer.  Also, frozen avocado (smoothies), cooked bacon, frozen chicken and ground beef (on sale).  Most of the recipes that I use never call for full cans of stuff, so instead of chucking it, freeze it, use it later.  Half a pepper?  Chop the rest

* [Cheesy Hamburger &amp; Broccoli](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/cheesy_hamburg_broccoli_cass.html)
* [Stuffed Peppers](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/make_me_stuffed_peppers.html)
* [Meatloaf](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/meatloaf.html) - with spinach and cheese
* [Chicken Parmesan](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/chicken_parmesan2.html) - with shirataki noodles (which you don't freeze- learned the hard way)
* [Peanut Chicken Curry](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/chicken_with_peanut_curry_sauce.html)
* [Meatballs](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/baked_meatballs.html) - with zucchini ""pasta"" and lowest sugar tomato sauce that I can find.
* [Coconut Flour Pancakes](http://www.nourishingdays.com/2010/07/fluffy-coconut-flour-pancakes/)

I generally try to choose recipes that freeze fairly well or leave out ingredients like sour cream and add it later.  

Any questions

**EDIT** this does not include breakfasts (aside from the frozen pancakes) and snacks.  I recently discovered [Linda's Cheese Pie](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/moms_cheese_pie.html) made without the crust and baked individually in ramekins.  It's delicious and usually counts as my night snack.

Secondly

I am 5'2 or so

I've tried diets. I've tried working out. I used to be fairly active. I even used to run. I have a very hard time losing weight. I have hypothyroidism

I get heart pains frequently. My body always hurts. Taking out my trash or walking back and forth in my house makes me out of breath. I'm fairly certain I'm either close to diabetes or full blown. I rarely leave my house. I have no real life friends or family...no support system. I'm all alone except for my pets. And my online life. I need this life

I'm terrified. I don't want to die. I want to live for my pets. I want to be happy

My budget is incredibly limited. I can't afford a gym membership

I need help. I really

I'm willing to work out somehow at home...sit ups, whatever. I'm willing to figure out a diet plan. From what I've read, Keto sounds like it's the way to go when you're a land whale like me. I live on food stamps, and I do try to buy mainly healthy foods, but I sometimes buy the bad stuff just because it's cheaper. 

I'm not looking for a pity party, support, whatever. 

I don't want to die alone and have my body rot into the floorboards. It's one of my biggest fears. Nobody will even know I've died until my body has wasted away completely. I want to be missed. 

And now the pictures. I've edited them to keep my privacy as much as possible. My hands are shaking right now. I went all out with these. I'm totally naked before you. Please don't crush my soul.

This is the album of a picture every week starting on January 30th 2012 to January 28th 2013. Here's another picture I've shared with some people

**Diet/Food**

I'll start with giving my MFP account just in case anybody wants to add me. Things aren't that exciting but you can check what I ate and the consistencies www.myfitnesspal.com/fodazey. Here's a general breakdown of the foods I ate:

*Protein*

- Lean chicken

- Lean/extra lean ground beef

- Beef/pork steaks (cut was depending on price

- Whey protein (Dymatize Iso-100 and Kaizen whey from Costco)

- Eggs

- Fish (mostly smoked salmon)

A lot of people would think ""oh man, I use lean cuts so I can use more fats within my cooking if need be. 

*Fat*

- Unsalted butter

- Extra virgin olive oil

- Renee's ceaser/ranch/blue cheese dressing

- Hellman's mayo

- Coconut oil

Pretty simple here. Use butter for cooking, liquid sweetener, mustard and vinegar). Coconut oil has been used for some random 'dessert' things because I never really enjoyed it for cooking. 

*Vegetables*

- Broccoli

- Cauliflower

- Spinach/baby spinach 

- Lettuce

- Avocado

- Brussel sprouts

- Bell peppers (more so green than any other color)

- Mushroom

- Onion

Once again, sauted broccoli or just an easy salad. Mushroom and pepper were used for my Philly cheese steak dish. I also made the occasional chili with kidney beans and crushed tomatoes but that happens once every few months. Other than that I keep things pretty simple and didn't over think it. 

*Dairy/Miscellaneous*

- Cream cheese

- Heavy cream

- Sour cream

- Cheeses (provolone, parmasan, etc.)

- Almond milk

- Almond/peanut butter

- Sesame/pumpkin seeds

- Spices (onion/garlic/chili powder, half salt)

- Low carb ketchup (I bought this at SuperStore in Canada)

- SugarTwin liquid sweetener

- Almonds/walnuts/macadamias

Self explanatory here. I use cream cheese for some chicken dishes or mix it with avocado for a nice dip/topping. Cream is used for creamed spinach and a little depth in the ice cream I make. Almond milk for drinking and recipes. Almond/peanut butter goes in the ice cream or just take a spoonful for the lulz. Sesame seeds are used in the sesame bar courtesy of keto4life. Ketchup is used for taco salad or just general dipping (or homemade russian dressing). These are things though that aren't used every day but are convenient to have.

**Exercise**

Initially I did plan on working out and I've done a few spurts but prior injuries have forced me to go into physio therapy. It proved to me that I was doing the majority of exercises wrong anyway and that the just getting a good foundation was better for me at the time being. I do plan on going back to Strong Lifts once advised by my therapist. Until then

**Miscellaneous Info**

Other than all of what you can see here, I wasn't hungry at all. Know that this changes and you shouldn't really hold yourself back on calories. On days that I'm hungry I'll just eat but stay keto and more than likely I'll still lose. I've gone through phases of absolute hunger or absolute non-hunger. Just know that our bodies are trying to tell us something so eating over calories for a day won't hurt as long as you stay in parameters. 

As for water, I find it goes in cycles. 

Besides all of that I did use fasting to my advantage to fit in meals. Some days 16/8, there are days when you're hungry and some days you aren't and you just need to be aware of how your body is reacting and what to do for it.

1371389914.0,1ggbm4,[Update]Tomorrow is my 30th birthday and I just hit my goal weight!,nebulight,318,58,24,"Pretty excited. I've always been kinda chubby, and a few other things I figured why not.

The first 50 came off with diet changes alone (no working out). That took me 4 months, it was three eggs and 4 pieces of bacon. Lunch usually consisted of 100grams of spinach, 1tbsp full fat Caesar dressing, 2 oz of salami and 2oz of cheese. Dinner was usually meat and a veggie. I really didn't eat much of anything else. However when I started working out I kinda fell off the wagon. I ate all my meals keto, but would cheat with snacks (handful of chips, a few pieces of chocolate, small things) with probably kicked me out of keto. I also bought those Bryers Low Carb Fudge bars but would eat 2-3 a day :( I was still losing weight, no more low carb fudge bars that I'd binge on.  The weight has started coming off quickly again.

My workouts are pretty basic. I do the 30 minute circuit at planet fitness which basically has 10 stations that work different parts of the body and 10 stepping stations. I also ride my road bike about 60-80 miles a week.

I think I'm going to update my new goal weight to 175. I still have a bit of torso fat and some around my thighs. I'd like to get lean.

Keto on everyone!

1360081032.0,17xs28,[Pics] xpost from loseit. Started working on my health while I was paralyzed; no longer paralyzed and I lost 140 lbs.,Niceguy121,310,49,39,"A fellow redditor from [r/loseit](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) pointed out this subreddit to me when I posted there. Then I realized I've been on a Keto diet the past year of my life. He mentioned you guys might like my story

So just a little *back* story on what I've been through the past year to drop the weight.. I woke up paralyzed from the bellybutton down about a year ago, and probably 200% more in shape than what I was before the paralysis. This is all with zero surgery, really hard work, and little miracles. I truly am lucky! I may have lost a year of my life recovering, but I gained a lifetime of wisdom from it. If there's a lot of interest, I can edit this with what happened to cause this. 


I started my weight loss Journey with a 1200 calorie diet, which I mainly got from my coffee cream in the morning. You can eat all the protein you want, but the main structure of a meal is normally protein and a veggie, as well as a fiber. Exercise is key though, as it is with any sort of diet. You HAVE to stick with it, no matter what. You can come up with really lame excuses to why you shouldn't work out that day, but you're only hurting yourself in the long run. My exercise when I first started was walking around a tiny living room floor on my walker three times, I used a little motorized bicycle that I could use while sitting in my chair. Even though I couldn't lift my legs to pedal that bike yet, progress-wise. I swam laps for an hour straight and then ran in the pool for about 30 mins at first, trust me. You have to constantly push yourself


These days I'm back to a weight training regiment; where I don't put a ton of pressure on my back, wheelchair, or any sort of assistance. 


The doctors told me I would never walk again. They literally said, that eventually I would be paralyzed. Obviously this devastated me, but one night it was like i flipped a switch. Instead of sitting around depressed that I'm morbidly obese and paralyzed; I literally said, ""I'm not going to live my life like this the rest of my days. There's no way in hell that this is it. Fuck that."" My experience made me believe in the power of human willpower. You can do anything you want in life, if you want it bad enough. Take me as living proof; I shouldn't be walking right now, let alone running.


The main reason I'm posting is to gain a little bit of motivation back. Life is amazing right now for me, which to me is really beautiful; I honestly couldn't be happier. I figured if I couldn't get pumped up to go another 100 lbs, then perhaps I could inspire someone to change their life around, or even just to motivate them.

1369359352.0,1exzeu,Funny but [NSFW] [NSV] comment my wife made to me about my weight loss while on our walk this evening at the gym.,scgoodolboy,349,92,53,"So my wife and I have both been doing Keto about 12 weeks now. She is down around 30 lbs and looking great. She Still wants to get about 25 more off I think she said. I have lost a little over 50 lbs now and have a goal to lose about 70 more lbs. 

We started going to the gym together about 5 weeks ago then my wife hurt her ankle and we have not been going for a couple weeks now. This was our first night back and we road stationary bikes about a half hour then walked the track outside for a while. 

While we were on our walk outside we were talking about our losses and how it was feeling to get smaller. (Now I normally would never share the rest of this but I feel pretty close to you guys now since we are all on the difficult process to lose weight together. You all are sort of my weight loss support family) That being said I told my wife I feel for the first time like my belly isn't sticking so far out but instead is starting to get floppy at my belt line. I hope this is making since what I'm talking about. It just feels more like a lot of skin now I guess as opposed to a mass of fat hanging over my belt and it only sticks out inches instead of a foot like it used to. My wife then looked at me and said she knows and that the best thing was my belly doesn't slap her in the forehead anymore when she is orally pleasuring me. I about fell over on the track laughing. 

I had never thought about it when it was happening cause I was just enjoying what was being done. At least now she is not receiving brain damage for loving me. Anyway I hope this doesn't offend anyone. I would normally never share something like this in a public forum like this but I felt it was a small weight loss victory that others could enjoy. 

We have been married 19 yrs this past March and I have been overweight for the majority of those years. I really hate this is something that she actually thought about or didn't like during our love making. She had never said anything about it before and I would never had picked up on it. I hope this doesn't embarrass her too much and I told her I was going to share it with you all because it was so funny but also something others of you may not realize or have thought about either. As our bodies get smaller and more in shape we are able to enjoy many things better about life even sex or foreplay in this case.

&gt; Essentially I have quit sugar; I realized that I was highly addicted to sugar and that its effects were doing horrible things to my life.  For instance if I didn't eat for a while I would get horribly cranky or if I ate a bunch of sugary food I'd be really down and depressed the following day (all mostly verified from some searches online).

&gt; In place of sugar now I eat more fats (not transfats mind you) which I have found to be the only way to feel properly satisfied with my meals.

As a result I am considering creating an iOS and Android app focused on Keto dieting

I already have an app half way through development for an upcoming keto cooking youtube channel/blog that a friend will be releasing in the next couple of months. Initially the app was just going to break up the youtube videos into individual steps so you could follow along on your phone/ipad while cooking


These are the extra features I am considering at the moment

 * A keto recipe cookbook database with user ratings and reviews

 * Recipe ""Mods""
	* Each recipe would have a ""Popular Variations"" tab allowing the community to add or substitute a step or ingredient to keep thing organized

 * A fat/protien/carb tracker and all the commonly used food calculators
	
 * Some kind of web interface (either a simple website

 * ""Substitute"" product database
	* not sure exactly how this would manifest itself

 * And finally the original intent of the app

How many here would be interested in an app like this? What features would be mandatory for you to be at all interested in using it? What keto specific features would aid you on your diet that you currently can't get from the numerous existing dieting apps on the market? And if you are interested



EDIT: Wow I am glad to see there is so much interest. When I can see the light at the end of the tunnel I will start posting some regular progress updates. In all likelihood the youtube channel will be releasing before the app does

The first 9 weeks were a breeze, HIIT sessions, kickboxing and work with no problem. In the 10th week I hit a serious wall, I was incredibly tired all the time and mentally exhausted. Even though my body was looking better than ever, I was starting to look sickly and gaunt in the face. I think it was just a pro-longed period on such a big calorie deficit, not so much the keto... 

I hung on another 2 weeks

My problem was I knew I had to start eating more calories, and chest measurements along with my weight and monitor my caloric intake for the first week(s) to put my mind at ease, and make sure everythings stable.

So I calculated my maintenance calories using Lyle Mcdonalds basic method. It said 2500 per day, once you reach your goal weight, it feels so great to be able to NOT eat at a calorie deficit. I have alot more energy and can eat much more food without putting on weight.   http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/how-to-estimate-maintenance-caloric-intake.html

In 2007, etc), I suddenly started to gain weight like whoa. I mean, I'd always been on the heavier side of normal for a girl, but never, erm, *fat.* Now, it was like I couldn't *not* gain weight. I'm 5'8"", or chocolate peanut butter ice cream

It's so terrifying to feel like your appetite is betraying you. Terrifying too to try to diet as the mainstream says you should, ""Seriously, what do I have to lose? Atkins is so unhealthy -- but if it helps me to *stop getting fatter*, I am down with unhealthy.""

I laugh looking back at that moment. My entire life I'd been the low energy one, ""Enjoy life now, this is the most energy you'll ever have!""

Well

Trying a very low carb, in my view back then! But the prospect of becoming truly fat seemed even more desperate. So, I looked up a bunch of easy recipes on low carb forums. I baked chicken and bought string cheese and made some truly disgusting meals in the beginning and winced as I added tablespoons of butter to my eggs.

But within three days I saw one difference that kept me going: while I felt like shit, *I wasn't constantly hungry* any longer. And that alone was enough to keep me going in the beginning.

About a week in, at first. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was getting so much stuff done. Errands didn't exhaust me. I no longer had to fight to stay awake in the afternoons. Instead of wanting twelve hours of sleep a night, I was waking up after eight or nine. 

""Holy shit

Oh

It took me about six months to complete the weight loss period. I ended up dropping forty pounds. As a thirteen year old

Since my weight loss

At some point along the way, it all became natural. And along the way, even while losing weight, I kind of forgot eventually about weight loss as the ultimate goal, because for the first time in my life, I just felt so damned good. And all that extra energy? It finally drove me to the gym, where I discovered that I'd never been into exercise because I'd never before had the *energy* to exercise. Now I had it

I'm not sure why some people react so dramatically to a ketogenic diet. But for those of us who do, and I don't miss them afterward, and having them no longer triggers cravings for more. After almost five years of eating this way, it IS the norm. 

Anyway


*edit to fix a typo - stay awake

As I write this from being six weeks strong now on strict keto

- When people asked me about keto or laughed at my plate of bacon
- Don't treat keto as a 'diet'. It's not. I just think of it as a lifestyle 'experiment' that I enjoy.
- I have a massive sweet tooth. I found that the cravings for chocolate/sweets came at certain 'weak' spots during the day. So rather than just say ""cut all sugar"", and straight after dinner. So I scheduled a coffee for each of those times (or tea). As soon as that 3pm craving for milky sugary chocolate came over me, I just made a strong coffee with heavy cream (along with the usual 3L of water each day of course).
- Someone on here wrote a huge self-post a while back which really resonated with me for a particular point: don't think long-term on this. Set day-by-day goals. Each day as it comes. You made it one day without sugar or starchy carbs? WINNER. Now just do it again and again. Small gains

1373660691.0,1i6de1,Things I know after a year on Keto,LoneCowboy,285,45,68,"After a year on keto and more than a few pounds lost

1.  Weight loss is about diet, but it doesn't have dick to do with weight loss.  I can't tell you how many people I see come on here with great plans to do keto, exercise and do all this other stuff and within 3 weeks they disappear never to return.   They may just be bored with /r/keto, but my guess is that it's too hard trying to do everything at once.  Ignore the exercise at first.  pay attention to the diet.   The diet is hard at first, it's a pretty dramatic change and the diet is way more important.  Set doing some exercise as a goal (after I reach X lbs, after I lose X lbs, I'll start doing run/walk/lift/whatever)

2.  Weight loss is definitely emotional.   Don't deny it, you will be in better shape.  This is why stalls and plateau's are so dammed frustrating.  You are doing everything ""right"" and the body is not cooperating and it's like rebellion and anger against your own body.  

3.  On the subject of anger

4.  nobody reads the FAQ.  Ok, it's quite good and there is a lot of information in there.   On the same subject, nobody uses search either, or reads before posting.   Seriously, use the search, Luke.  

5.  Monthly reports, stories are dammed motivational.   Best part of my day is reading/seeing those stories of success and showing that anyone and everyone can do it.

6.  Cheating sucks and isn't worth it.  This is a strict diet in one parameter (everything else is pretty wide open), a month is not good for your long term health or success.  The first month is hard as your body adapts, but it's offset by the rapid weight loss.  The 2nd month is harder.  Almost everyone stalls, the diet gets boring (or can), the weight loss slows.  you see a lot of people disappear at the 6 week mark.   Be strong, stay on it, it really gets easier and after 3 months just becomes a normal way of doing things.   Keto is like magic, you have to think and check everything and some places and foods are just off limits and you just need to accept that.   It works

7.  I haven't seen this posted in a while but it used to be around here a lot.  ""The next year is going to pass whether you choose to do anything about your weight or not"".    I like that statement.  

8.  Fathead

9.  Carbs are dammed addictive.  Anyone who doesn't think so has never tried to quit.  

10.   Find a real butcher, you might pay 50cents of a dollar more a pound, but it's worth every penny.  The yield is better, the cut is better, the meat has taste.  You're saving a ton of money eating keto (which sounds counter intuitive, but if you've been here a while you know it's true), take a few of those saved dollars/euros/pounds and treat yourself to real meat instead of crap.   A fishmonger is great too if you happen to have one.  

11.  use a food log (for at least the first 3 months as above).   Way too many people post issues here and have no food log.  No food log means we can't help you.  YOU need to know what you are eating.  And since people really only eat about 10-20 things a week (this is true BTW), but for me, the key number is grams of carbs.  Keep that at 20 a day or less and everything else falls into place, including your appetite. 

12.  Stalled?  (not just PISS, this matters a lot).  Cut out dairy.  Those solve probably 90% of the stalls.   But do one thing at a time so you learn what stalls you.  What stalls me may not stall you.  

13.   Moderation.  Yes, this is a marathon and really a lifestyle change.  Low carb works, but going low carb and then going back to standard diet is just going to get you fat again.  You wouldn't be here if your body could handle the standard carb heavy diet.  And to be a lifestyle change, it has to be maintainable.  This means real food (no shakes that simply won't last beyond a few months) and sometimes it means taking a breather.  maybe you have an anniversary or birthday or just a night out.  But plan it, don't allow it to just happen and make sure you get right back on plan.   A meal is moderation, a week is falling off the wagon.  It's an addiction and it's always going to be there, you need to plan for it.  

14.  There are some great recipe sites on here and I've tried a bunch of them and some of them sound really good.  But for me and my wife, and green leafy veggies.  Simple, easy, tasty with only occasional ""hard"" recipes.  It's real food (it's probably some what paleo/primal) and it's maintainable.  It's also easy to eat out as you know what you can have and what you can't.   This may not work for everyone, but I bring it up because sometimes you see people trying all these neat sounding dishes, but that's hard week after week, month after month.  Even in standard diet, work thru and find yours.  

15.  nobody listens to you, that's not healthy"".   You can try, but it's really easier and more successful to wait for them to come to you with an open mind  (or failure at everything else)

16.  It is dammed good to be 2/3 of the man I used to be and I wish I had found this years and years ago.  I'll be on some form of low carb for the rest of my life, I'm full and I'm (almost) in shape.  I feel 15 years younger and except for my missing hair, I am 15 years younger.

I hope that helps and i wish everyone success on their journey.

Picture on the left was this morning and on the right was mid- december. 

What can I say

Me:
I'm 20, and started at 223lbs in January. My current goal weight is 170 but will vary based on aestethics. 

Diet:
I basically never counted calories, and half- assedly kept the fat to protein ratio pretty substantial like probably 80/20. This'll probably surprise a lot of you, I probably drink on average 15 to 20 shots of vodka/whiskey/tequila/rum a week, actually counting calories those days I drank and eating some fruit beforehand... probably not the healthiest of habits but... college. lulz. 

Exercise:
I work out about 4 to 6 times a week doing about 20-30 minutes of cardio which includes rowing

Fun Fact:
Probably what got me my losses the quickest is the fact that I'm a pretty hardcore raver. If you've ever been to a rave, which are multi day raves that last about 8 hours a day, since new years. I'm only a sober/drunk raver so I don't do drugs so don't think that contributed to my weightloss. 

For those who care:
I started this keto journey because I didn't want to be hindered by my weight any longer and it's easier dancing with hot girls at raves if you're not creepy or fat so... yeah. Also

But in all seriousness

Hi Loseit.  I started my weight loss process almost three years ago.  Since I have kept the weight off for almost two years

I hope this post helps somebody else.  My weight loss and lifestyle changes really helped to bring me out of a negative time in my life

The most important thing I learned about weight loss?  The process to lose weight is not unique in most people

I was 26 years old, and new house.  I was on a strict diet of everything in excess.  I like to eat a lot at a time, and love sweets of all kind.  I also worked the majority of the waking day to ensure that my program was successful.  I saw fast food and the wrong foods as the only option with my busy schedule.  And that is how I became over 250lbs.  

My motivation came from a few places:


   * I was 26 years old
   * I was at a size 38 pant
   * I started shopping for vitamins and personal care products on a health site.  I wanted to share this with people
   * A custodian at my school came to me on a Monday, and said I would talk to the kids about it.  
   * I hated how I looked


I started a few days before my 27th birthday.  My process came from a variety of sources, but here's some tough love.  I was reading an article written by financial expert Dave Ramsey on reducing debt.  Dave's strategy is to snowball debt by paying off the lowest balance first, and then then using the monthly payment from the paid off bill to add to the monthly payment of the second highest bill, and so on.  I remember Dave's quote going something like this: ""Now you might be thinking that the better way to go about this is to pay off the highest interest loan first in order to save money.  And I'll say this - if you were so good with numbers, you wouldn't be reading my article.""   Not trying to be a jerk, but that hit home.

Feeling like I had no motivation and no place to get help with my problem

I read the article, I decided to only take parts of it.  In short, I did a lower carb diet with a cheat day that turned into a low carb diet with cheat meals on a cheat day.  I have always been able to lose 10-15 lbs on a low carb diet, but didn't have the discipline to stick with it.  I felt that a planned ""cheat day"" would help.  I also ate high fat to feel full longer.  I'm sure it's been said to death, but eating fat doesn't make you fat.  And my cholesterol numbers improved, so that worked in my favor as well.

I also felt that I had four options:


  1. Do nothing
  2. Eat better
  3. Exercise
  4. Eat better

I choice option two.  I realized that eating better is a huge change

In more detail

Phase 1:


   * Starting weight of 250 lbs.  I downloaded the Loseit App (I love how it gave me badges/""achievements"" like it was a game).  Logged everything I ate.
   * Tuesday-Sunday I ate 100 grams of carbs or less.  I didn't count calories, anything.  Just carbs.  This allowed me certain fast food items.  Every morning I had a Big and Toasty sandwich from Dunkin' Donuts, or I had a couple of servings of some cereal.  Tried to eat within an hour of waking.  
   * Switched to drinking only water
   * Monday was my ""cheat day.""  I picked Monday because I felt it was my most stressful.  I eventually moved to Wednesdays (my longest day) and finally settled on Saturdays due to social allowances. 

Under 100 carbs a day helped me to lose 25lbs with visible results in about two months.  I was feeling better, so I decided to enter into the next phase.

Phase 2:


   * Current weight was 225lbs.  I kept going with Loseit.  Had my 25lb badge
   * Sunday-Friday I ate 70 carbs or less.  Still didn't count anything else.  This still allowed plenty of wiggle room
   * Cheat days were Saturday.  In this phase, though, and wouldn't allow another one until six consecutive days passed.

Under 70 carbs a day helped me to lose 20 pounds in almost two months.  Sitting at 205lbs

Phase 3


   * Current weight was 205.  Loseit was still very helpful with logging food.
   * I switched to 50 carbs or less every day
   * Completely took soda of all forms out of my diet.  I only drank coffee, but learned the pattern of the tiles behind the urinal perfectly.
   * Cheat days continued, and I had no desire to see junk food after a cheat day.

Under 50 carbs a day: pant size was now a 34 if I sucked it in really well.  Weight was sitting at 190.  My goal was 180lbs (my high school weight).  I felt so good now

Phase 4


   * current weight was 190.  I still used Loseit
   * I reduced carb intake to less than 35 carbs a day.  I could still do a sandwich if I wanted to, so I tried to avoid it all together.  
   * Cheat days continued, 3, 400 carbs.  Felt terrible after them.  Still kept on track.


Under 35 carbs a day: I could squeeze into a 32 (my high school pant size).  Finally got down to my first goal of 180 within a month and a half.  This was the hardest phase so far

I kept going at it, but I had exercise slightly to get there (I took hour long walks every day…nothing too major).  I now currently sit at 170-175, and try to stay here.  My danger weight is 180, and I avoid ever going above that.  Certain brands I can fit into a 30 pant size (down from 38), and my average shirt size is medium, although some smalls fit me.  

If you've made it through the novel above



   * Persistence
   * Work for small changes.  Losing even one pound is worth it
   * My work schedule was still hectic for a while, no bun.  Jimmy John's Unwiches (get a card; after you purchase so many, you get one free).  Wendy's chicken salads were a staple of mine, and Culver's burgers, with cheese, no bun, extra mayo.  I want one now.  At home, all vegetables
   * We all know how to lose weight.  Most of us are not more special or unique in that science and body chemistry does not apply to us.  
   * Log ALL food.
   * Buy a Brita Bottle or Brita pitcher.  Never pass up a bathroom.
   * Don't tell people you're losing weight.  Just don't do it.  Trust me.  
   * Don't tell people how you're trying to lose weight unless you want puzzled looks
   * Don't use special events as an excuse to eat junk.  I skipped cake on my birthday
   * Scales are not an enemy, measuring arms, legs, waist, etc.
   * Eating healthier or real food might seem like it costs more money
   * Water, except for V8.
   * I associated the word ""snack"" with pre-school or elementary school, I should have the willpower or discipline to hold off on eating if I was a little ""uncomfortable.""  This took a bit to get used to.  If you do what I did, it's ok to eat larger meals as long as you are staying within your counts.  
   * Too much fiber is a bad thing.  Trust me on this one as well.
   * Stare at yourself in the mirror
   * Don't expect an athletic body without doing some work

For anyone doubting that they can do it, and I want all of you to have your own positive story.  Let me know how I can help.

Here is where the greater than great news comes in: I was at the gym today ( I started working out 3/17 for the first time in my life. I have never stepped foot inside a gym before then. ) and I was on the elliptical going my usual pace. Two empties on either side and wouldn't you know it

First things first. When I was feeling really down about myself in July of this year, and thought about all the times I've passed by it and not weighed myself, for fear of being scared of what the numbers would show. But for some reason, that day, I weighed myself. 


Boom. 245. At 19 years old. 


Crushed, I looked for diets on reddit. Keto was the first one I saw, and also have heard about it before on Reddit. I started the next day. Only then did I realize that I was having bread, rice, and pasta every day. I'm not exagerating when I say every day; I somehow deluded myself into thinking that having an exorbitant amount of rice and beans everyday would be okay if I had some salad with it. 


The first day hit me like a truck. It was hard. I never realized how many carbs I was having in a given day. But its not just about the carbs. It's about the type of food I was eating. McDonalds


The next couple of days sucked; they mirrored my first day expierience, stomach felt weird, etc. But I trudged through. Week two was where my body started to slowly adjust to my diet. I knew it was going to be a slow and steady journey to 200lbs, and if I quit, it would only reflect on my lack of willpower.


So, I quit my second job. I took myself away from the temptations of fast food, and other shit I didn't need. I didn't need the extra money, It was only for pocket change to buy geek stuff, and more fucking food, so it wasn't a huge deal for me. What was a huge deal, was the amount of food I was consuming out of sheer *boredom* at that job. I now think of how lame it is to eat when your not hungry. Who does that? I did. But not anymore.


So the weeks go by. Eggs and bacon for breakfast. Dark green salad for lunch. Hungry during the day? Handful of almonds. Then I discovered food processors, I think I'm starting to enjoy this type of food. 


Month one. July 31st. Down to 235. Okay. 10lbs? Not bad. But was I happy? Mostly. Hell, and that made me happy.


Month two starts in August, the ladyfriend was loving that I lost ten pounds. Second month rolls by, and whilst she still likes my devotion to a diet, she didn't like how restrictive my diet was in terms of what I can eat when we go out, which was usually food loaded with carbs.


So, ends no carbs, ends the weeklong spree of my being an excellent keto-er. But, It makes me happy. It makes me look forward to an awesome weekend with my girlfriend. I love it. Granted, the first week I had popcorn, I threw it all up hours later, but that was because I had too much, but more importantly, it gives me motivation to really step my game up in terms of not overeating to compensate my for my popcorn


Month three, walking to work instead of taking the metro, and getting better quality foods, I was convinced I was going to step on the scale and see 250. I was scared, what can I say.

But then I thought about why I started Keto. I started because I wanted to lose weight. No


Where am I getting to with this block of text? I'll tell you. I no longer follow the Keto diet to the letter. Instead


As of today, I am now 220lbs.

A couple of years ago I was at my heaviest, and finally decided to do something about it.  I managed to get myself down to 190 lbs through the C25K program and pretty severe calorie restriction.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really get any more weight to come off, no matter how much I ran or how little I ate.  So I gave up and just decided to maintain.

Then I started having health problems, but in August of 2012 I was finally diagnosed with [PCOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome).  My doctor suggested a high protein, low carbohydrate diet to help manage my symptoms and lose weight.  I started keto that week.

I'm now 5 months in and 33 lbs down :)  I've only had one migraine since starting keto

***Bans and Bullying***

In the last week I've had a stupid number of personal requests for the lifting of bans. Other than the obvious trolling

If you're new the community or haven't read the rules in the sidebar yet

* If you continually shit on other members of this sub
* If you scoff at other people's slow progress or mock their efforts
* Please don't sexualize posts. Sensibilities get hurt and people scream bloody murder about double standards. If you wouldn't say it IRL
* The mods are not punchbags for your anger
* If you fly off the handle and resort to name calling or personal attacks in the comments section you will be banned. That's not what this community is about.

So it's pretty simple - if you aren't enjoying the sub and aren't willing to discuss things without throwing the toys out of the pram, then you're doing it wrong.

Thanks to everyone else who has reported all the spiteful crap in the last week. I'd appreciate it if you didn't PM me in future though

***Tagging and Descriptions***

Could I also remind people to tag their posts correctly with good

***Other Keto Subs***

Lastly a friendly reminder that many much more specific subreddits exist to cater for everyone

/r/ketocirclejerk - Exactly what it sounds like. If it's all become to much and you need to commit carbicide...  
/r/ketorage - Almost a circle jerk sub. Keto rage comics

**128lbs in 12 months!**

Keto has saved my life, working out and biking home.  (yes, even on leg day).  I have not been this small since probably 1997 or so.   

I really had no idea what to do, I read an article (on a political site no less) that talked about how the guy was 299lbs and he was not going to go over and he lost 50lbs in 6 months eating bunless burgers, bacon and eggs and meat for dinner.  10lbs a month for a fat guy without doing much work would be great.  The article (which I can't find again) referenced /r/keto and I explored.  Read the FAQ, read links, ordered the books and thought ""oh, what the heck""

I lost 30lbs in the first month.   

Clearly, even on a cheat) and without them, I feel full, I feel better, I feel human again.  My blood pressure is in the normal range, the meds are long gone (in fact all meds are gone).  Except for the lack of hair, I feel like I'm in my 20's again.   My energy is back  (who needs to eat? fasting is easy) and i've gone from a 4x shirt to a 1x.   and from a 48 fat jeans (that barely barely barely fit) to the 40's in the picture that are too big and I can actually pull down without unbuttoning.  

What  you are really waiting for

1) Take a head of cauliflower and chop it into small parts.

2) Use a food processor to pulse the small parts into a fluffy rice consistency. Pulse it for 10-20 pulses or until the bits are the size of rice. (depends on the food processor I guess).

3) If you don't have a processor

4) Put about 2 tablespoons of coconut oil (olive oil or butter would probably work) into a pan and head the pan to medium/high.

5) put the cauli-rice in the (large) pan with melted oil/butter and keep fluffing it and turning it every minute or more frequently depending on how hot the pan is.

6) The point is to get the rice cooked to the point that it's a little soft and tender

7) After it's cooked put a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar (find the sans sugar variety) with a tsp of low calorie sweetner (erythritol or stevia

8) Add 2 tablespoons of cream cheese into the cauli-rice and mix well

9) After 1/2 an hour or until the rice is cool, and add fish, veggies, you name it. I like smoked salmon, regular salmon, cucumber, and more cream cheese. Use the sushezi to push out the tube of ricey goodness onto the seaweed and sushi mat and roll it up.

Enjoy! Hope this helps. It's so good and sooo keto!

After 18 months of no longer eating the way I did in college mixed with working out every day I was down to 280. I was really happy about this because at the time I though I was doing everything correctly.... 

I injured myself lifting and had to take some time off from exercise. Keeping the same diet (SAD) I noticed I started to gain the weight back. After some digging in /r/fitness I found people talking about this Keto diet. 

In Oct 2011 I started my Keto journey. I had a starting weight of 292lbs. My blood pressure was high. I was depressed and hated everything. I believe I may have been pre diabetic. I didn't sleep well and energy was almost always low. I wanted to sleep after any heavy meal (full of heart healthy whole grains of course). I wore a XXL shirt and had a 48"" waist. I was miserable. Thanks to this video [The food revolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FSeSTq-N4U4) and www.dietdoctor.com I was convinced this was the correct way to eat. Also read Why We Get Fat? and watched Fat Head. These made me look at science more than what stupid fitness experts were saying.

[Pic of me in March 2010](http://i.imgur.com/8zVNa.jpg) 

Since then I can report I sleep like a baby. My blood pressure is normal. I weight 223.4 lbs as of today. I am no longer hungry all the time and I have so much energy. The energy is the thing I am most excited about. I am always looking for something to do now. It's so weird and awesome at the same time. My waist is back to a size 38""

This was fine until I became obese and couldn't lose the weight by exercise or diet restriction. Something was OBVIOUSLY wrong. I was an athlete for crying out loud. My own MD tried to put me on statins. My Triglycerides were over 300 and my HDL was under 40. I was 35.

It isn't that MD's don't get the biochemistry. Trust me

I've been trained to be some semblance of a respectable authority on peoples health. I am (or was )a liar made legitimate by virtue of a degree. I should have listened to my mother when all she served was meat, and a little rice.

Rest assured. ALL MD's are not fools who are unwilling to step back and reassess. The evidence is building and the tide is beginning to turn. I fear that until the NIH begins to fund research in the area of grain elimination and higher fat eating habits the general public will still think that fat is bad.

FYI I just realized this about 1 month ago when I was researching diets incorporating (whatever the cereal which compares itself with an egg is). I was directed to this sub-reddit by google and someone ranting about the evils of grains and etc. So I looked up paleo and read Sisson and Cordain. Then I read ""Wheat Belly"". I was still wrestling with the amount of fat in the diet. Then I got a hold of Taubes which blew my mind. Then I watched the video about fructose and HFCS [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM)

My fiancee is pissed at me because she loves her sweets. The other MD's I work worth are leery of me although they have commented about my ""wasting away to nothing."" I've lost 30 lbs in month on grass fed beef and buffalo, eggs, pork belly, and veggies.

So thank you for vociferously expounding on the evils of whole grains. Thank you for not shutting up and listening to nay-sayers and experts.

EDIT 1: I am not saying that appropriate drugs do not have their place or that they cannot be beneficial. I'm saying that preventing disease is much preferable to treating disease.

EDIT 2: I'm not sorry for being a doctor. I just wish the entire system understood the ramifications of their diet recommendations and the science behind them.

Keto isn't about fake bread and cakes. It's not about low-carb wraps and muffins and diet sodas. It's about eating differently than we used to.

I understand that we all have a sweet tooth and we need to satisfy that on occasion. But

When keto started, half Oopsie rolls, and Dr. Pepper 10, and Atkins Advantage bars, and low-carb sweets. What the hell happened?

I know I'm not the ruler of the keto world, and stop eating so much damn fake-ass food. I don't care if you can drink 10 litres of Coke Zero, and have it fit into your 20g/day limit. That doesn't make it healthy. That doesn't correct the carb addiction.

Anyway.. I get that this isn't gonna change anything. I get that a bunch of people are gonna be like 'Ugh

In fact, it seems like that's all we're eating. All things in moderation, folks. Please don't make this stuff the majority of your diet. Back to basics. Meat and veggies, with the occasional low-carb treat.

I know I posted an update not long ago but I'm so excited and I have no one to share it with

I went shopping with my friend today to find a dress for her Hen's night soon. I told her I didn't want a ""fat girls"" dress, you are small now... But in my head I feel it's mocking. (I'm working on my body issues!). 

Anyway we walk past a store that I used to shop at which is size 14-26

Looking through all the dresses, I want my legs and chest to show.

I kept telling her I won't fit in the small, TOO BIG! Alright I said, ill try the small. So I slid the small on and was confused, ""why is it bigger?"" I asked my friend. She said, ""I made you put the small on first as a test, so you can see how you actually are smaller than you think."".

I began crying, ""Now put the XS on."".

I put it on and it fit like a glove. I cried again. The XS is a equivalent size 14 and the smallest size they carry

This moment has been THE changing moment from transition of a large person to an average size. She did a great thing for me today. I just want to shout out to the world

I keep seeing posts concerning people who have only been on the diet less than a month (or sometimes only a week) and they are talking about stalls and plateaus. I know that if you have been lurking here awhile that keto might seem like a miracle cure, then you would know about PISS and how a plateau isnt really a plateau until several weeks have gone by. In addition, the resources in r/keto talk about the various ways to combat a stall/plateau.

Ultimately though

We are here to help, are you tracking to the letter, did you cheat, calorie deficit, etc? If you take the time out to do this, then you can probably answer your own questions about plateaus.

I started Keto on December 5th 2011. As of today I have lost a total of 47 pounds, I am 5'5 and I started out at 246 pounds. I've had a pretty horrible binge eating problem my whole life so my weight has always been pretty out of control, and I've had a hard time sticking to something long enough to make any progress. I am very happy to say that Keto has helped me completely kick my binge eating problem, and is slowly helping me look the way  I want to. I would still like to lose another 40-50 pounds, so I have a ways to go, but I am so very thankful that I found this subreddit, and read that FAQ 5 months ago. I plan to be a lifetime Keto-er.

now i read /r/keto and it's all about ~~""1 carb bread!"" this or~~ ""low-carb chocolate sundae"" this and that. come on guys, honest-to-goodness food for chemical concoctions and bread that can do your dishes?

if you want a chocolate sundae - eat a chocolate sundae. just eat it occasionally. if you want bread

i know this will be an unpopular opinion, but replacing two cups of sugar for two cups of splenda isn't really that much of a better trade, and i don't mean just nutritionally.

When browsing around /r/loseit one day, I thought it was some kind of joke. Lose weight eating fat? That's ridiculous. Every one knows you can't lose weight by eating fat. Eating fat makes you fat! Slowly, I began to see what was actually going on. I understood the thought process and the basic biochemistry behind what keto was. After three months of lurking and accruing information, I finally started keto. Throughout the year, I have visited this subreddit almost daily looking for posts with new information, videos, or motivation. I have learned so much about nutrition and how the body works and feel confident in the choices I make. I have watched countless hours of lectures, and documentaries

So here I am today, to M. I went from feeling like shit during the day, to feeling the best I've ever felt. I went from being hungry every hour, to eating twice a day. I went from an elevated blood pressure, to a normal blood pressure. Most importantly, My self esteem went up. I no longer care if people judge me because I know that I'm doing something to improve who I am.

I started Keto December 5th, and I wanted to show how far I've come. The last time I posted was when I hit under 200 pounds, but I've lost about 24 more pounds and I'm getting very close to my goal weight. 

Some stats:

* I'm 5'5 and I'm currently 175 pounds.

* My waist has went from 39 inches to 32 inches.

* My hips went from 51 inches to 42 inches.

* My chest went from 47 inches to 42 inches.

* At my heaviest weight I was wearing around a size 18/20 in jeans and now I wear around a 12/14.

* My BMI went from 40.9 to 29.1 ! ( I am no longer considered obese according to BMI)


I have been pretty strict with what I eat, but sometimes I eat up to 80. I also make sure that I have fat with everything I eat and drink. Coffee gets heavy cream, and my broccoli gets lots of butter. I love staying full. I do not exercise, unless shopping counts. I'm currently at a sort of plateau though, so I intend to add some exercise and maybe some intermittent fasting. 

Keto has helped me get so close to my goal, but now I feel like people notice me because I have a nice curvy figure, and a cute face. I love this community and it has been such a blessing to me. I hope this inspires someone to keep going. I want to lose around 20 more pounds and I want all of you here to do it with me. :D Thank you r/keto.
