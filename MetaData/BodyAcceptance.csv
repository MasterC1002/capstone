I have a bit more stretchmarks that stretch just a little lower. A couple on my lower back and I have them all down my arms.

I work out 3 days a week at the gym on my days off but I haven't gone in a week. I was visiting my boyfriend in California. When i'm not at the gym on days i work i do some exercises at home. Crunches and whatnot. 

I work out as much as I need to stay healthy

Nothing is really going to change much when it comes to the loose skin and stretchmarks.

Surgery is an option i've considered...and someday in the future i may do just that. But right now....I think i'm just fine. I have someone now who loves my body just the way it is. Who thinks that i'm beautiful and I know he means it.
My arm flab..he rolls his eyes at. My stretchmarks...he thinks are no big deal because bodies tend to do that when they gain or lose weight. He's a rare person that actually understands that real people don't look like they belong on the cover of playboy/playgirl magazine. People have flaws and there's nothing wrong or gross about that. Especially when those ""flaws"" are a result of you bettering yourself.

That doesn't make sense.  Because if you are in public, because anyone (regardless of how sexually attractive you are) is allowed to be there.  If someone has a problem with that, then they should be the ones locking themselves up and not going outside, not you.  It's their problem that they can't handle that some people don't fit their perfect ideal vision of beauty.  It's is not you who deserves to be shamed, it is them.

I grew up fat, I tried everything in my power to get rid of it. From the age of 7-8, my weight gain was so much and so alarming, that I ended up being part of several studies in hospitals. At the age of 10 I was offered weight loss surgery, which my mother was outraged at (and rightfully so!). I was 10, I wouldn't even know the ramifications.

I was told by people from the Karolinska Institute (who headed up the MandoMeter program a few years back) that I couldn't be a 'real' woman, implied that being fat and male was infinitely more acceptable to being fat and female. They ensured that I always felt like I was letting everybody down or just being a disappointment, combined with high praise and rewards every time I shed a few ounces.

I'd always been a tomboy, it was beneath me. I hated makeup and other women who wore it. I convinced myself that it was made for people who wanted to cover the things they were missing inside.

If I had to wear makeup for an interview

It wasn't until I ended up with a romantic interest (who has now been my partner for just over a year) that I realised that makeup didn't have to be about the terrifying inch-thick application of powders and chemicals to make you look like somebody else. Particularly recently, but just because I *want* to look good for him. He's seen me without makeup, he's seen me with and he does not judge me, and loves me all the same. But it makes me happy to go that extra mile to look nice.

To sound like a slogan, I feel pretty good. Yeah, okay, finding clothes is a pain where I have to catalog-order them, and I could be healthier because the student lifestyle of instant ramen is *really* bad for me. And yes, I'm still exceptionally tomboyish and am a lover of fine lagers and ales, and I still spend 99% of my time wearing jeans and tshirts and stealing my partner's shirts....but at least I can wear makeup now

So why don't we do something like that here? I'm always seeing posts from people either 1) trying to pep people up with their own stories of acceptance or 2) venting their own frustrations with their struggles.

My proposal would be to alternate each week: one week there's a ""Tell us what you love about your body"" week and the next would be a ""what are you still struggling to accept about yourself"" week.

She had the last of the summer sun sparkling on her nose in the form of adorable freckles. She was slightly muscular, runs-a real go getter! Her hair wild from the pool with streaks of gold highlights. Lovely, I thought!

She grabbed an ice cream cone and was heartily enjoying it as she stood in line with her shampoo

I watched her look at them. Finally, full of hope and curiosity. 

I watched her start to thumb through the pictures. She would stop and look closer at some of the pictures. Sadly

There were pages upon pages of women-well…I think they were. The pictures were close-up pictures of body parts. Very thin legs

The next article was about not having too saggy of breasts

She turns a final page and it screams out “Got fat over summer? Don’t be mocked! Lose that fat now!” My heart sinks and at that exact moment I want to run over and grab it from her hands. 

I want to save her from such thoughts and from such despair. I’m afraid even with an army I may not be enough though. Not when every magazine, women, boys and men become “Things” something that looks a certain way and fits a certain mould.

It's had an interesting effect on me. I'm a lot less self-conscious about my body. I think it's because something I consider ""pretty"" is now a permanent part of me. It's like I'm presenting my tattoos instead of body.

It's almost like makeup-- where I've painted on something to hide its faults and enhance its prettiness.

To the Mods: I really don't know if the bits in the top half are largely appropriate for this subreddit. Please remove my post if it doesn't jive. 


As far as my body goes, I got poked fun at, but in high school I had insane amounts of self confidence. I didn't give two shits what people thought of me. I was a badass outcast and I didn't care. 

College comes and I gain weight faster. Not a huge deal. I never thought I was a sexy beast, but I didn't really care. I had my boyfriend and family who loved me and that's all that mattered. My mom starts doing personal training and getting healthy and fit, a recent cancer scare in our family caused her to wake up and want to live longer. But she's getting happier, feeling more secure with herself. Good for her. I'm finishing out my last year of college (146 credits worth), and shit just starts hitting the fan. 

I just keep seeing the pounds slowly get tacked on me (10 pounds a year), ""Yeah, No. I want to get HEALTHY and I want to be able to do physical things, I don't want this focus to be on weight loss. I just want to be able to bike up the hill, and hike with my boyfriend"" The next few months I build up strength, but then he does really stupid bullshit that nearly kills me. Another trainer is shadowing us and he ups my standard workout an INSANE amount, not a gradual amount. I can't do hardly anything and nearly pass out several times in the session. Self Confidence blow #1. 

I kept telling myself ""I love my body, but instead throws a project at my face. I basically have to hand hold some outsourced people doing my job for way more money and far shitter than I would have done and taking 10 times as long. Self Confidence Blow #2. 

Whatever, stepmom, and other family at dinner. My dad is an alcoholic and made some quip about how he wasn't too sure he was gonna come since I wasn't technically graduating due to summer school. Big woop. I let it slide. The next morning we're cleaning up for the guests arriving for my big day and I get a text ( A FUCKING TEXT ) saying Dad's not going to go to my graduation... Self confidence KO! (My mother, boyfriend and all my mom's family suspect that my dad had no real intention of coming to my graduation at all.)

Apparently I wasn't good enough for a phone call

Anyways the graduation fiasco... that was the first week of May. Thankfully my mom's family and my boyfriends family still all showed up and supported me through what should have been one of the proudest days of my life thus far. But

I was stressed, I shut down. I don't sit there and try and alleviate the stress, I just fucking quit. 

I broke down nearly every other day, I couldn't look in the mirror without hating what I saw. I didn't feel like that confident me I used to be who didn't care what society thought of her. 

I hated myself

So what in the fuck changed? 

**Clothes... honest to god the thing I hate the most. Clothes.** 

I KNOW RIGHT? I'm the angry kind of person that gets mad at society for fat shaming and having ill fitting clothes for big boobed gals like me. I grew up hating the very idea of fashion and clothes. 

I went down to see my mom since she was having a rough emotional time with work. We decide on Saturday to get drunk (I drink maybe once a month... if that) at lunch and go clothes shopping since that's the only time I'm willing to buy clothes. Up until this point I HATED buying clothes. All the clothes I would wear were bland t-shirts and jeans, I don't like clothes that can't cover the belly &amp; butt! They literally feel weird on me, it's not an appearance issue it's more of a ""I don't like to be constantly messing with my shirt and pulling it down"" issue). 

We go into the store and I find this brand (Rock &amp; Republic for the ladies who are interested). I see some XL's &amp; 14's and think, and even better... I LOOKED GOOD. My 38 DDD's looked a-freaking-mazing, and that 210lbs looked sexy as FUCK. 

As materialistic as this all sounds, but oh damn was that fun and I think he liked it too ;D 

I'm not 100% better

Tomorrow I'm donating my grandma clothes to goodwill. I'm tired of hiding my body cause society says fat girls aren't beautiful. I dumped the trainer and his weight loss bull crap. It just wasn't for me. I'll still go to the gym mostly cause my workout is boxing and beating the crap out of things tends to be a nice de-stresser. And today I ate how I used to eat before the self confidence nose dive. I was able to eat normally again. 

Oh I did manage to keep up with my more in shape boyfriend hiking the other day! 210LB WIN! ) 

And the best part. Today I really smiled. I was able to look at myself in the mirror and accept my body and all it's blubbery goodness. &lt;3 

It feels so good.

Today I came on here and read a couple of posts. I won't point out which ones specifically

1) A lot of people seem to think that ""body acceptance"" includes ""coming to terms with being ugly"". This really irks me. I thought the idea here was to understand that societies ideals and expectations of appearance and beauty are incorrect social constructs that in no way need to be true. If that is the case, but I looked at your picture and I don't think you're ugly at all! I don't see what your problem is!""

None of this seems productive or helpful in any way. When someone is having body image issues, well, you're just ugly, so get over it."" Even worse, when someone is trying to share how they feel ugly and how this causes struggle in their lives, it seems equally counter-intuitive to then look at a picture of them and say ""Wow, you're SO not ugly AT ALL

2) A lot of people here seem to be of the belief that dieting is good, but come on now. A lot of the comments I've been reading here are shocking. If you guys don't see how things like extreme dieting and North America's war on obesity can have harmful effects on people, I think you need to start reviewing some of the posts on this very SR.

TL;DR: I have been shocked by some of the comments on this subreddit recently

I feel the need to post this, so I'm just going to copy and paste it. The rules of this subreddit state:

A place for body acceptance.
Welcome to r/BodyAcceptance! Click here for our philosophy
We are often bombarded with the ""ideal, regardless of their weight. We all suffer from a lack of perfection and comparison to genetic rarities and we all deserve to feel good about ourselves and comfortable in our skin.
We welcome bodies of all shapes, and disabilities. We are about accepting yourself right now, as you are.
Some hard and fast rules:
Any abusive behavior towards any poster will not be tolerated. This includes a general rule of respect and civility.
No weight-shaming.
No advocating diets, and it is absolutely not acceptable to push them on others.
Posts violating these policies will be removed.
Any questions
If you see anything that does not follow the rules listed above

Several of these things have been broken by many of the comments I have been seeing here

**Edit 1:** I can't see the original post that was made regarding this because it was deleted, promoting it can still in a lot of ways lead to weight-shaming, and pushing HAES on somebody is still ""telling anyone how they should eat or how they should exercise"".

  Last August, put up my middle finger, and have never had so much time in the morning ;). I'm not sure why exactly I decided to do this (stop shaving). I think I noticed I hadn't shaved in a while and just didn't do it again. But a clear influence was  a neighbor and beautiful kindred spirit I met around that time. She had hairy armpits but was the most classy, controlled, feminine woman I might ever meet. So when I look in the mirror and think ""I'm not feminine"" I think of her and smile.

  Hairy armpits and hairy legs do not diminish my breasts and ovaries.

  However, no one has yet. Honestly, I picked the perfect time to adjust as I've been in sweaters and jeans since September (I'm Northern). And with bikini season barging in I think about how self-conscious I get then more often. 

  And, too. Being 19, I haven't completely escaped the social pressure, so I occasionally trim. I have had a guy tell me that he wouldn't go down unless I shaved. My feelings weren't hurt, but my reaction was 'meh' I'll move on. The most shocking thing to adjust to was realizing that I was no longer a girl with a vagina in the eyes of casual sex seeking men (or what have you). But rather, I became this foreign object behind glass. The amount of random men hitting on me has significantly dropped (60% due to the dreads I assume, like I said it's winter). One hand - it's great

  Probably the best thing that came out of this besides feeling more like a HUMAN than a fucking doll with inadequate parts, if nothing else, try it before the summer.

My waist goes in, and my thighs go out. Creating what I formally called a ""double bump"". 

For my entire life, my permanent muffin top, my butt that was misshapen due to my high hips.

I thought losing weight might smooth it out. Nope. I thought gaining weight might add some fat and smooth it out. Nope! And then this just led to further frustration with my body and my esteem with my weight because I'm naturally built as a little bit bigger.

But then I found the term for it. I can't even describe the incredible feeling of finding it. It was kind of like a weight had been lifted. Other women have this

I'm not there yet. But I'm on the road to beginning to finally love my body. And I'm so excited that I've finally found the door to do that. It's still hard. I still think I look weird. And I know it's just in my mind - I see other women with violin hips and think nothing of it

The front page is riddled with posts about how ""curvy"" is sexy. And to some, The very title came off in a strange tone-- ""Was it really just 30 years ago that women were allowed to have round hips on television?""-- The reason it strikes me as odd, is because I see women like the ones in the picture all the time on TV and magazine covers.

I was never thin. My younger sister has always been this teeny thing, or what exercises I did, I could never lose weight. I was teased mercilessly for being big, even though I really wasn't that big once I went through my growth spurt. 

In high school I dressed to cover myself up. I wanted to be invisible. For the most part, and being in a sorority was the key. I mean, how many ugly sorority girls are there in the world? I mean really, truly ugly? I was (and pretty much still am) convinced that being in a sorority and being ugly are two mutually exclusive events, but I also believed that being in a sorority was what made you pretty. 

*If I make it into a sorority, and eventually realized something.

**I was wrong.**

Nothing about my appearance changed. My sophomore year, not hate, and that's why I love her as my close friend and really consider her a sister. If I had someone else as a roommate, who knows what my year would have been?

Anyways, I opted out. I still saw everyone getting tanned though. I saw so many half-naked (or more) girls that day, all I could do was feel self-conscious. 

But then I listened. 

""I'm SO fat!""

""Ugh I hate my boobs.""

""Ew

""I have no ass this SUCKS.""

""My ass is huge!""

""I'm too pale!""

""I'm too tan!""

Brushing my teeth that day, but I like to think I have some decent looks going. I like having curves, real curves, and looking graceful when I walk in heels, and having some killer calves (thank you 16 years of dancing) to show off in them. But if someone who is in good shape, healthy, and ""hot"" hates on their body, then *how can I justify being proud of mine*?

The issue kept with me the entire year. I dressed well, setting this sort of standard that I felt guilty for not meeting, and more guilty for being proud of it. It hurt me and confused me, so I did the most logical thing I could think of: I talked to my actually perfect roommate.

She felt the same way. She's skinny and built like Barbie, ideally, we would be able to change about our bodies, but we both decided we liked ourselves and our bodies. We decided not to body hate in our room. It was a sanctuary of Body Acceptance, a refuge from the negativity we felt elsewhere. 

What I learned that year was that being beautiful was a completely internal thing. You can be hot, it's impossible to stay confident. You have to remove the hate from your life. I saw it every day, every morning as I got ready for class. I popped my music in and tuned it out. I took my own little attitude towards body hate. Any time I heard ""I hate..."", I allowed myself one quiet eye roll, one little shrug to shake it off. I dismissed it. What did it matter what *they* thought of *their* bodies? Nothing. All that mattered was how *I* felt about *mine*. And, as I discovered, I felt good. ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1a9ntb/what_living_in_a_sorority_house_has_taught_me/

6. Peppermint foot scrub. Tingles so good.

7. A great body wash for the shower. Feels luxurious.

8. Sleep - 8 hours. It's good to feel rested.

9. Sun - I get depressed without enough sunlight. This occurs both in the winter (less light) and summer (staying inside to be cool or during rainy patches). So sometimes I just have to go and sit outside in the sun and recharge. Just for about 15-30 minutes.

I'm skinny and small. Not unhealthy, I have gotten much of the same thing. What is strange to me, however, is that it's often not intended in a malicious way like it seems to be against bigger girls (like typical ""fat bashing""). I get comments from people who don't understand why anything they say would bother me at all.

Things I hear on a daily basis:

* I'm ""a bag or bones"" or ""skin and bones"". 
* I look like I'm starving.
* I'm clearly in danger of blowing away in a strong gust of wind.
* Seeing me naked would be like giving a bath to a kid
* ""Do you even weigh enough to get your period?"" 
* ""Do you want my lunch? You look like you need it.""
* ""Wonder when you're gonna hit puberty.""

Etc
Yes

So here's the thing that really drives me crazy. I love the whole body acceptance community, because skinny is the ""norm"", nobody reacts to the skinny-shaming like they would to fat-shaming. It doesn't get taken seriously. (Not that fat-shaming often does, unfortunately, but you get my point).

Things that I constantly see from ""body acceptance"" groups on facebook and other places:

* ""Men like real women with curves"".
*Oh, just one of those strange fakers with a vagina.*

* The ""since when did THIS become hotter than THIS"" pictures. I've sure you've seen them- a bunch of skinny girls in bikinis, pointing out the beauty in curvy girls, but why do that when bashing others at the same time? 

* ""Guys like meat
*...Cool.*

I tried to do more research on other things to include, it's hard to be okay with your body when it seems like others aren't. So my question is, how would you handle these kind of situations? I have tried to point out before that skinny shaming isn't any better, and we should promote all body types, but have gotten nowhere beyond pissing some people off. I also never know how to respond towards the strange and (I feel) extremely inappropriate comments made to my constantly about my weight, even when we're not at all on that subject. Nobody seems to understand why I would be bothered by any of this, because I'm currently more of ""society's ideal"" of very skinny. What should I do?

I can count on one hand the numbers of pictures I've taken since puberty that I can tolerate looking at, but I'm pretty sure I'm not imagining the bump or the width of my nose, the fatness of my cheeks and the weakness of my chin.  Also now that I'm almost 25, I've stopped trying to convince myself that my 32B boobs will eventually grow.  They're not. 

I've been told in the last few years that I'm pretty, but I rationalize that in a few ways:  1) men will say anything to sleep with a girl,  2) men will sleep with anyone when they're horny, and 3) even if they legitimately think I'm cute, that's only because I can't leave the house without foundation and tons of eye makeup to distract from the rest of my face.  As you can imagine, this issue results in serious problems in relationships.

To be specific; the *lack* of weight.

I'm a generally healthy male, I simply can't gain any weight.
I'm painfully skinny
It's something that's really harming me because no girl wants to be with a guy who's so tiny

It's partly because I have such small bones
I can't be around anyone unless I have long sleeves covering myself up. 

What makes this even worse is that I went over to the US recently to see a friend (read: potential girlfriend/whatever) and she saw my forearms. She asked me on the train back to NJ ""why are you so skinny?"".
Yeah thanks. THAT helps a *lot*.
I felt about 3ft tall.

Isn't it weird that guys have to be in the middle? You can't be too skinny but can't be too fat either?
I'm not weak or anything; far from it - I'm much stronger than I look - but it just pisses me off that I was born this way and I just need to vent a while.

There's probably nothing I can do to improve how I look. Wrists will always stay the same size unless I manage to miraculously become fat.

This won't happen either.

I’ve had social phobia and depression since my early teenage years. At age twelve I started cutting to cope with it—I’m twenty-two now. For one whole decade I spent my life in fear when around people

Soon

I have retrognathia. That means my jaw is set back into my face, landed on my chin and cracked it open. Upon learning that, I felt angry, I felt that my entire life has been dictated by one moment that was beyond my control.

My therapist says I have body dysmorphic disorder in regards to my jaw and the rest of my body. I have always suspected this. It’s both a relief and scary to have this diagnosis. I felt hopeless. I felt that I was a monster that was unworthy of love. I felt that I deserved all the cuts I had given to myself over the year. I felt that anyone I loved would not be faithful to me because of how I looked.

Today: I say fuck that noise.

I just ate a bagel. I didn’t eat for a day and a half
I have my insurance card laid out on the table, and I think it will work.

I looked in the mirror and tried to see myself not through the funhouse glass that I usually do. I tried to look at a whole

I didn't cut myself last night

There is plastic surgery that I can get, but *for me* I am thinking of making that choice. But I will only make it after I love myself as I am now. And then, it will be my choice and my choice alone. I have already judged myself so harshly on this choice, wondering if I am betraying myself. I have judged myself too harshly on it, and I will no longer be afraid of judgement from others on it. When I make it, it will be made my me, because this is my body and no one else's.

I want to love someone else, can I get an amen?). So. This is me. I am posting an actual picture of myself, without a throwaway even. I never thought I could be able to do that. But I want to overcome, damnit. I am going to overcome. I am a strong, resilient woman who is intelligent, capable, worthy and I am awesome.

1352933398.0,137g37,School dress codes are predominantly aimed at girls and serve to negatively define them as individuals. Arguments for or against?,Epicfailer10,34,4,19,"(The is from another discussion I was having


One could argue our bodies are a core part of part of who we are, I mean, they take that negative connotation into account when they’re forming their opinion about themselves and their role in society.


That’s one of my problems with the typical dress code you find in schools… Most of the rules seem to be directed at the girls

-Shirts should not be too low-cut. 
-Shorts/skirts should not be too short. 
-Bra straps should not show. (My kids’ school says “proper under garments must be worn”. I don’t know what their definition of “proper” is or how they plan on going about checking…) 
-Pants should not be too tight. 
-You cannot show too much of your side (when wearing tank-tops). 
-Shirts should not be so short that they show back/abdomen.


Even when the rules could be applied to both genders (tight pants, a teacher might call her out for it, but I doubt people would be as upset by it if it were just the waistband of plaid boxers that made their debut (vs. a thong). And along the same lines, I would venture to guess that if a curvy girl and a thinner, more ‘boy shaped’ girl were wearing the exact same v-neck shirt, the girl with cleavage would be more likely to be called out than the girl without cleavage. The v is equally deep on both, but one appears more ‘sexy’ than the other.


Because isn’t that the point? To cover up things that might draw our attention to sex? It’s hard to read the rules or see the particular way they’re implemented and not draw the conclusion that (a) the concern is with preventing students for thinking about sexual things and (b) especially when it deals with the sexual nature of girls. If so, it says (since sex is bad) sexiness is looked down upon, therefore (4) people who are perceived to be sexier are somehow (morally) worse than others. And since females are the biggest target of the dress code implementation, then (5) females must be the most guilty of the crime.


In my opinion this is condemning the female unfairly. My daughter is 5. At their school they can wear tank tops, undeserved guilt.


I think it is equally as damaging that we’re telling the students that they are judged by what they look like. If the teachers/administrators are focusing so much on their clothes and the way their clothes display them


Not only girls will pick up on this social norm- the boys do too. How can we get angry at boys for defining girls by their bodies if it’s perfectly acceptable for their male and female teachers to define them by/ focus on their bodies?


It plays into all of the other social norms. Girls are bad for dressing sexually but guys will be guys and think about sex. A girl who has sex with a lot of guys is a slut


As a kid, but the girl’s couldn’t even have tanks for jerseys and our shorts had to come to two inches above our knees or we would be told to change. At church the girl who had a sexual ‘vibe’ would be called out for her skirt being too short when the dorky, awkward girl a year older than her with an even shorter skirt would be overlooked. I think that sends important messages to both sexes and it’s the girls who suffer the most for it.

After that birthday party, but over sized 'boy' clothes to cover my shape and budding breasts. Later in my teens I would still cover my self up.  At the same time being really reckless sexually... later I would take blades to my breasts and thighs so no one would ever want to look at them. 

My partner noticed something in the photos... and said they don't really look like me

Here are some additional pictures of me

[Trying to be sexy. Might be NSFW

With the exception of Flirty and Halloween

**EDIT: Please feel free to comment with any questions you may have for me.  I am happy to answer them.  Reddit is being painfully slow tonight

**EDIT 2: Downvotes?  Really?  I challenge anyone who thinks they should downvote this to comment as to why they did so.  Let's start a discussion

[I'm Miz.](http://hphotos-sjc1.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/184669_10150107758281067_800891066_6245179_2680131_n.jpg)  I'm 28 years young and am a curvy 300 pounds of well-educated and travelled woman.  I grew up in a small town, I am the only one who is obese.  I've had the opportunity of visiting Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, San Juan, Alabama and California.  I currently work as an IT Help Desk Specialist for a Medicare company.  

I was always a large child.  From the womb I weighed 7lbs 6oz, they stuck a bottle in my mouth.  I was already larger than the other children once I started elementary school, and I was given the nickname ""Ms. Piggy.""  As a child, who fully understands that she's different even at 7 or 8 years old, that can be pretty harsh and painful.  

Bullying got pretty harsh in Jr. High and High School.  I was already a size 20 by the 9th grade.  I never dated.  I was pushed in the hallways.  I had things knocked out of my hands -- all because I was different.  I had the typical crushes, but it wasn't enough. By my senior year, I was a 22/24, and nowhere near what most people wanted girls to be at 17 years old.  I ultimately went to prom by myself.  Needless to say, I didn't stay long.

My entire life

After high school, being on my feet all day and playing Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade. (This game is so hard to find nowadays around here.  The last time I really played it was 2004.)  I was a size 16/18, and I felt great.  Then I lost my job.  I took another in a call center, and without the constant movement, the weight slowly crept back on.  The hours I worked kept me from going to the gym at a reasonable hour.  I wasn't able to go to the arcade as often because I was also living on my own at that time.  Things had changed so drastically in a short period of time that I was unable to keep up with my needs regarding the way my body handles caloric intake.  By the end of 2006, I was a size 26/28, at 330 pounds

Regardless of my past, but that didn't bother me.  I loved him for who he was, and he did the same for me.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to last and we eventually split apart... I returned to Nashville to start over and try to live life as a single girl for a while, but I eventually started missing the companionship I had with my ex fiancee and I started dating...

The dating scene was pretty rough.  As a plus-size woman in today's world, or me leaving because the guy got too touchy-feely... Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE sex.  I just don't want to do it on the first date.

The failed dates

After a spat of failed dates, but he told me he couldn't give his heart to me.  I was crushed almost immediately.  I couldn't help but think that it was my body image that was keeping him from wanting to be with me.  A few weeks passed, and we got to the point in our friendship where we both admitted that we were both sexually frustrated.  A FWB type relationship started.  He obviously liked it, so after a few ""dates"" I asked him what he felt about moving further.  He said he still couldn't see himself dating a ""full-figured woman,"" and my response was, ""If you can get aroused enough to sleep with me, why can't you see yourself taking the next step and wanting to be more than just a booty call?""  He couldn't answer, whom he had been crushing hard for but was too busy with another man for him to get noticed.  That's when I told him that he should stop looking for someone who doesn't want him and try to open his mind to the options he has available to him

*Perfect is how we see ourselves,* **perfect is you... And sometimes perfect is right in front of you.**

A few weeks passed and he called me.  He asked me out on a date

I figured I'm comfortable enough with myself that I'd give it a shot

I'm twenty-four year old white woman. I'm five-foot seven inches and last I weighed myself

I've always considered myself big. At birth I was ten pounds and I've just steadily grown from there. In fourth grade I needed my first training bra

The first two people who would point out my weight would be my grandmother

My grandmother is tough grit and to this day will still pat my belly and snidely mutter ""Haven't lost any weight there, lol. I just take what she says with a grain of salt now, she's eighty-six and having hailed from the depression era, she had to harden up. 

However as a kid I didn't understand. She would force me to eat kale soup until I fell asleep at the table or felt like I was going to throw up. She would let my (5'1"" really thin) sister eat whatever she wanted. I remember one time she sat me down opposite my sister at the table while my sister hesitantly ate an ice cream pop and I went without. I recall my grandmother staring at me the entire time with her chin in her hands and occasionally making remarks like ""See? Good little girls who don't eat all the time can have ice cream."" Or ""When you aren't so fat

My dad was more relaxed on my scenario, he jerked me up and started yelling at me. Telling me that this was why he didn't horse around with me, I was too big. I could have broken the screen door and he'd have to pay for it, or I could have hurt him or worse, my sister.

The other time I specifically recall with my father was when he sat down on the stairs above me and (known for his brutal honesty) told me ""Bubba."" (my nickname he appointed me) ""You're going to be starting to look at them boys soon, you ain't gonna find any."" (He paused then, and said) ""Well.. Unless they're fat like you. Or fatter. Than the only reason they're dating you is 'cause they can't get nobody better.""

I tried to hold back my tears from that
(Especially considering he walked out on the family.)

This is starting to turn into a tl;dr and my apologies. If, I'll answer them. That being said though, school was obviously horrible for me. I've been kick, punched, sprayed with a random assortment of things, I've had my hair cut, gum shoved in my hair

Just for being overweight.

I've had my former pediatrician try to sell me on stomach stapling when I was eleven- for down the road

Then, but unfortunately years of (and I don't use these words lightly) mental, emotional, and physical abuse by my family and peers had left me utterly disgusted with myself. 

I tried to not eat. I tried to throw up after eating, and I always failed, and when my father threw us out and other occurrences led to my teenage world falling apart- I turned to self-mutilation. It didn't help my weight, it didn't help anything aside from giving me an occasional feeling of release. I was sent to see a psychologist about my (then) situation, which did help, until I was sent to see someone else who prescribed to me wellbutrin. Which didn't help. I was so stressed and depressed, I was making myself sick on a daily basis. SARB was called in due to my poor attendance record and I was almost shipped out to foster care. My case was dismissed however.

That was my turning point. With the friends I had

I remember hiding in the bathroom one time and hearing two relatively beautiful and thin girls come in and the one was obsessed with her looks

I soon began to like how I looked. I liked my curves and how soft I was. I found 'pro-BBW' sites all over the internet and started associating myself with that sub-culture. I ate what I wanted

Then my third year in peer mediation we received a new girl. Probably eighty to ninety pounds, and I was quick to fight for the righteous side of fluff and ignorantly bash all the thin people out there- until the teacher (in her wisdom) interjected and asked the girl her opinion on my comments. 
The girl took a moment and eventually said that she probably ate as much as I did, how hard her parents were on her- except for her, it was on the other end of the spectrum. 

I immediately shut my mouth and over the course of that meeting finally figured out simply: People are going to be how they're going to be. Sure some people can be unhealthy, now how they look.

I eventually lost interest with the whole 'pro-BBW' thing. It wasn't my cup of tea when I realized that a good number of the guys who are into BBWs are like guys who wouldn't be- they like them because they're big

Final word, and I'm not going to strive for something like that. I'm not going to diet, but I am going to exercise and be active, and I am going to better life choices when it comes to (what I do feel personally was) my addiction with food. 

And on an unrelated note I tell people: I don't want to lose weight to be skinny. I want to lose weight to be able to survive the zombie apocalypse.  :3


(Edit: tl;dr I was mocked and bullied all my life for being fat.

Upon meeting this girl I realized that she is totally average (well not average

After a few days I became more and more disturbed by this mother and her obsession with what her daughter is eating. The little girl is absolutely terrified of food that doesn't come out of her lunch box. ""Mommy says I can't have this!"" If she thinks we forgot to bring her lunch box out she will start to cry, banana, and orange juice. The girl starts freaking out because she knows she's not supposed to have juice. I tell her that her mommy would be ok with this, that a smoothie is healthy, but she is literally having an anxiety attack. I take her into the office so we can call Mom. Mom says the smoothie is fine for her and that she is ""so proud of her for asking first.""

Overcoming my body image issues is something that I haven't done yet. I am still very much dealing with them

List of Things That Have Helped Me 

* Places like r/bodyacceptance. For me personally

* Finding my own personal style. I used to try to conform to the college student (i.e. shirts and jeans)/Orange County (i.e. skanky tops, but have come to realize that I am what I am: a geeky femme who likes bizarre, bold, dramatic, and/or vintage clothes and accessories. I don't look like many other people and often am dressed a notch or two above others in terms of the formality of my clothing, but it's become my signature and I love it. I also know what flatters my figure best and makes me feel more confident.

* Faking it on days when I'm not so good with myself. People who say that confidence makes you attractive are onto something. It's not a magic pill, take more pride in your grooming and appearance, and smile more (what some call ""natural glow"" or whatever). That can do wonders.

* Exercise. Feeling strong, I do it to feel at home in my body.
Realizing that, socially speaking, but she freaks out about her ""big stomach"" because she doesn't have a six-pack.

* Follow-up to the last one: weight lost does not necessarily equal confidence gained. I weighed my lowest and was at my fittest when I was most depressed and had the least amount of things in my life that kept me happily busy (I would go to class,"" unhappy, and as if no one would ever want to fuck me, let alone love me. I didn't resemble the social ideal of hot and I never would, despite my hard work, and it really bothered me. So yeah, I don't labor under the delusion that weight loss will not necessarily make me happy, sane

* Lots and lots of orgasms. These don't have to be with a partner, wants, and general sexuality is very joy-inducing in more than one day. That post-orgasm wash of contentment hormones, as well as tingling all over my body, reminds me of why it's so good to have my body, flawed as it might be. This isn't for everyone, but having multiple partners (polyamory and open relationships) and BDSM have also made me happier with my body.

* Sincere, and strangers. A smile, a thumbs-up, an approving glance, a well-timed comment -- things like that help me to feel awesome. Of course, you can't control others, but you can control around whom you choose to spend free time,,False,t3_xd57o

tl;dr: My husband is wonderful, but it made me feel so low, especially after we'd had a great night, it just felt like even after that bodyrocking experience it still wasn't enough for him.  I have not asked him to never look at it again, I think that is unreasonable, because me getting upset came out of insecurity (he also tried to cover it up which upset me as well.)  Sorry for the long tl;dr... it needs it's own tl;dr 
I'm not sure what I'm looking for, or if I'm morally opposed, or what...

A little bit of background on me... I was raised Christian... I'm a little shaky on that at the moment but I still hold a lot of the values.  My husband is an atheist.  
I have my own image issues (also continually recovering from an eating disorder), so he'll recommend I go (and this is an ok thing with us because I really do feel amazing after a good workout!) or he'll tell me how wonderful and sexy I look, he'll caress the parts of my body I struggle with.  He's amazing and I know he loves me dearly.


So last night we had wonderful amazing shout from the rooftops sex.  It was great!  We both finished, I knock... nothing... I knock again (thinking he probably has his headphones on) and then hear him get up to open the door.  I see a blank google page.  Instantly I know what he was doing.  I could feel it.  I ask, and he says ""Oh the door, just habit, and I was watching gaming streams""

I let it go at first but then I ask him again ""Why did you lock the door?""
""just habit""

""Why did you clear your screen?"" 
""You're not going to let this go are you?""
""Are you lying to me""
Silence.
""What were you doing?""
""Nothing freaky I promise.""
""What were you looking at?""
I knew the answer before he said it

Instantly I started crying. He said he was sorry, that he needed more stimulation than me.

Because I interrupted him during his... session... he was still horny, and also, undeniably, because if he wasn't getting it from me he'd just go on /r/gonewild in the morning or something.  I am afraid that on nights when I am just not interested, I will make the decision to force myself to get into it, not for him, but out of fear or worry that he will seek it on reddit.

Eating Disorder – 

Oh God

I don’t like looking weirdly skinny.  I don’t want people to look at me and immediately perceive me as being ill.  I worried that this is happening more and more.  I’m a private person.  I don’t want to wear my heart out on my sleeve in this way

I’m frightened that other people will see or feel my bones, you know, but now I feel really fucking anxious whenever someone so much as touches my arm.  You’ve taken the pleasure of basic human contact away from me.

Speaking of relationships, and doesn’t deserve it.  You’ve made me feel proud of eating less than her.  Jesus Christ, I even feel good about myself when ____ eats more or looks chubbier than me.  In short, you’ve made me a secret adversary of my hardworking, self-sacrificing mother, and my innocent, 10-year-old sister.  And that’s fucked up.

I compete with my friends, or eating more than me.  On the one hand, I’m jealous that they allow themselves those candies or whatever, but mostly I’m just proud.  My God, though, nobody should ever be PROUD of themselves in spite of their friends.  I know this and I try to keep these horrible thoughts as secret as possible, but c’mon—I shouldn’t be having them to begin with.  You’re making me terrible at interpersonal relationships.

It’s not just in my thoughts that you fuck me up with my loved ones, and I’m rarely able to eat with my mum.  And even on those rare occasions when I do break bread with people, I’m always consumed by fears relating to calories and my weird food rituals.  I live in a society where eating together is meant to be fun, but you’ve stolen that from me, and have made me resort to strange, secretive food habits.

Hm, but I CAN’T.  You make me feel desperate when it’s 11 am and I’m still hungry, and yet I know that I can’t eat anything until 6 am the next day….or repulsive when I realise that it’s 8.30 am and I’ve already eaten 1,000 kcal.

I feel pathetic, I guess, but they pale in comparison to the next time I get to have a piece of BREAD.  I might have a BMI of ___, but I am a glutton and a food addict. Everything has become secondary to food now.  I don’t even feel like a person anymore, I care about so little else.  I feel like an eating disorder with legs.  And I’m so ashamed.  

Shame, but my constant thoughts about my appearance make me shallow and unkind.  You make me lie to people, too.  I lie about seemingly innocuous things because of you.  “What did you eat?” they ask.  “Oh, so much food!” I reply untruthfully.  That these lies trip off my tongue now frightens me.  Dishonesty isn’t pretty.

And let’s talk about the purging.  I haven’t done THAT in a while, bread, and melted chocolate?  I DO.  Thanks for the rush of endorphins at the end that’s ensure that I’d do it again.  And thanks for making me so efficient at it that I could do it before breakfast, in the school washroom, or on Christmas Eve, and so persistent that I wouldn’t stop, even if I was in incredible pain.

Oh God, or go to places where I can’t predict where/ when I’ll have my next meal, and exactly what I’ll be eating.  Holidays, restaurants, birthdays—everything—is anxiety-inducing instead of fun.  All I want to do is weasel my way out of “enjoying” these experiences. 

Eating disorder, when I had constant nightmares about being fat, and fantasised about carving the fat from my body?  Or how about Grade 12, when I first lost about __ lbs, and then gained them all back by bingeing and purging EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.  Now I’m 21, and I see a bleak future ahead.  I don’t even want to be alive, as the ‘life’ I picture is filled with insane thoughts and behaviours

And look—here I am still, I still WANT you.  You’re different from other conditions in this way.  I don’t want my anxiety or depression, much the same way I wouldn’t want cancer or the flu.  But with you—you reward me in these insidious little ways that make me cling to you, and become proud of you.  You want me DEAD, and yet I still love you more than I love myself.  I’d rather die than be rid of you, and you encourage me to feel like this.

Well, I see that the game’s up.  I’m in check, if not in checkmate.  Congratulations, you.  You’ve made my life a living hell, and have driven me to overwhelming darkness.  And what comfort do you give me, “friend”?  What do you say now, as I’m swallowed by the night?  Why, and you whisper in my ear

I hate you.

I thought that if I accepted my petite breasts, that they'd magically inflate. Of course, that wasn't body acceptance. 

So I went the cold hard truth route. I got naked and looked at myself in the mirror and said, and they will not get bigger if I just want it hard enough. They are what they are and I am not going to be Christina Hendricks. Ever.

(Wall of text and Possible triggers),whatthefox1818,31,5,33,"**Background:** For the first two years of high school I struggled with my weight being unhealthily low due to a combination of medical problems and eating too little. I was however very happy at this weight. When the medical problems were solved and I found myself at a healthy weight I was unhappy for quite some time. It took me until my senior year to accept the change in my body and embrace my new curves. Most of the time now


**Story:** After a fun and successful performance with my a cappella group Friday night my boyfriend and I decided to go to a beach-themed after party hosted by another member of our group. We swung by my house so I could change into something event appropriate. Although the party was beach themed, I put on a beach-y tunic length shirt, shorts, and sandals.    


Because I was planning on staying over at my boyfriend's place after the party and there is no legal parking at his apartment we were forced to park at a garage downtown. We parked the car and walked down to ground level when my boyfriend realized he left the ticket in the car. He's much faster than I am so I told him to run back up to get it while I started out for his apartment (where he needed to change into beach attire too) because we both knew he would catch up to me quickly. In retrospect I should have known better than to put myself in a position where I was walking downtown at night alone. Many worse things could have happened. That doesn't make what did any less hurtful though.    


There were many people out and about


As I was ahead of them I'm not exactly sure which one said what
""Hey! Hey! What's up with that??""  
""Oh god. Fatty. What the fuck. That's just embarrassing.""  
""Sssshh. Shut it.""  
""NO. She needs to know! Hey! Yeah! You're embarrassing yourself!!""  
""Oh god. (laughter)""  
""That skirt thing you're wearing is WAY TOO FUCKING SHORT FOR YOU. Thank you for at LEAST wearing black whatever the fuck that is!"" (talking about my long shirt and black shorts)  
""NO ONE wants to see that from you!""  
""too HUGE!""    


At this point my boyfriend had caught up to me and seeing what was happening and that I had no idea what to do gave me a quick squeeze of a hug and started walking backwards between me and my tormentors. He was calm and in control asking the drunks if they were having a good night and that they shouldn't talk to a lady that way and that they should keep their opinions to themselves. But they continued on even as we sped up and got further away from them. I couldn't hear it all because they were all hurling insults at the same time


I held it together until we got outside his apartment building. There I broke down in his arms. I didn't want to go to the party. I didn't want to move. I'm not sure how long I cried there or when he got me up to the apartment. I felt like shit. Every insult I thought to myself in high school felt true. I felt worthless.    


Being the amazing guy he is, and said all the things I needed him to to eventually calm me down and finally make me laugh. We even made it to the last bit of the party, which was a blast and exactly what I needed to stop my brain from reeling. That night though, falling asleep together, it all rushed back and he had to hold me and comfort me again for some quick silent tears.    


In these last few days


**TL;DR:** Body issues left over from high school. Now I'm 20. Three drunk guys followed me from downtown and yelled weight-related insults at me for several blocks until my boyfriend was able to intervene. Now my confidence is in pieces on the floor and I'm having trouble not taking what they said to heart. Help?

I couldn't give two shits about your weight"". This is HAES. Exactly this. From a person from a subreddit which actively speaks out against HAES and reviles it. So let's clear some things up. 

 Firstly

So what is fat acceptance and why would we support it? Well, shape, and condition it comes in. 

So why would we do that? Because we believe that you take better care of something that you love and because we believe that living your entire life miserable from body hate isn't a great way to live. Would you rather live with depression

So does fat acceptance require that you be a ""good fattie"" who follows HAES? No. Fat acceptance and HAES often work together but they don't have to. Some people just really hate exercise and really love certain kinds of foods. Again- quality of life is what's important. And some people will argue ""but if you exercise and eat healthy then your quality of life will improve!"" well.. maybe for them, but they don't have to. 

When fat acceptance and HAES work together: So, for various reasons but we tend to think of thin people as automatically healthy even if they don't work out or eat healthfully.. so by saying fat people can be healthy too they apply the same standards of not trying. The problem is that they fail to realize that a thin person is not automatically healthy- their health, just like us fatties- is dependent upon their lifestyle and food choices. 

What HAES actually means is eating healthfully and exercising because you love your body and want to nourish it and doing so regardless of the number on the scale. 

[The basic principles of Health At Every Size](http://www.peggyelam.com/haes.htm) (HAES) as outlined by the Association for Size Diversity &amp; Health are:

* Accepting and respecting the diversity of body shapes and  sizes.
 
* Recognizing that health and well-being are multi-dimensional and that they include physical, occupational, emotional, and intellectual aspects.

* Promoting all aspects of health and well-being for people of all sizes.
 
* Promoting eating in a manner which balances individual nutritional needs, appetite, and pleasure.
 
* Promoting individually appropriate, rather than exercise that is focused on a goal of weight loss.

So how do you actually practice HAES?

* find and exercise or multiple exercises that you enjoy (if you really love it that's the best!) and do it as often as you want, it's fun! 

* Intuitive eating- If you're following your internal cues then you're not going to gorge on junk food (at least not for long). Your body wants to feel healthy- it will want healthy foods.. you just have to listen to it. Sometimes it takes a while to really get back to intuitive eating because of years or decades of disordered eating. Eat what you want, end up eating a lot of the foods you've deprived yourself of over the years- it will balance out. Once you realize you don't have to hoard it because it's not going anywhere, then it won't be that big of a deal. This doesn't mean you can't make a decision like ""i kinda want a cookie but.. i think i'll have an apple instead"" because once you get the hang of intuitive eating the craving wont' be so severe that you ""have to have it now or the universe will implode!"". Just like when exercise is fun and not a punishment you'll do it, when healthy food isn't a form of deprivation you'll eat more and when treats aren't a form of reward, guilt, of giving in, you'll stop placing so much importance on them. For studies and more in depth information on HAES I recommend reading [Health at Every Size by Linda Bacon PhD](http://www.lindabacon.org/HAESbook/). It's a bit too complicated to squeeze into this space but it boils down to: eat when you're hungry, drink when you're thirsty

* Take care of your body. This means visiting the doctor regularly, of course, eating healthfully, intuitively, and exercising regularly. 

* Stop obsessing over your weight. It's just a number and it really doesn't matter. While you're at it

So let me go back over the main points or

* you don't have to follow HAES to accept your body or your fat
* but you do have to accept your body to follow HAES
* being fat doesn't mean automatically being healthy (neither does being thin)
* you have to work to be healthy
* but that doesn't mean you'll lose weight
* and you can be healthy even if you don't (which you probably won't)
* Even if a fat person chooses not to follow HAES and they're in poor health they still deserve respect and have the basic human right to be free of stigma and discrimination. You wouldn't discriminate against a thin unhealthy person
* and anyway
* and, lifestyle, mental or physical health, circumstances. Doing the best you can with what you have to improve your health in whatever way is what's important in HAES.

If you do lose weight doing HAES- that's fine. It just means that *that* weight is the one your body works best at. This may mean you're still ""morbidly obese"" or maybe that you find yourself ""normal"" weight. It doesn't matter. HAES isn't about weight, doesn't mean everyone else will. Stop thinking about weight as any kind of indication of health, character, or morality and you shouldn't have a problem. 

got it? good. If not, and knowledge-seeking way. If you just wanna troll and say ""but omg deathfatz!"" then it will be deleted, just like it would be in any other conversation.

I have all the knowledge to work through this. I'm physically healthy apart from a chronic illness that is now manageable, I'm loyal, I'm generous and hard working.

1299098281.0,fw181,Dear r/bodyacceptance: a note from your moderators. Please read. ,hlkolaya,33,11,35,"Dear r/bodyacceptance 


Your moderators have all gotten together and decided to make a post to clarify a few things. This is not a subreddit about fat acceptance, male acceptance, disability acceptance or racial acceptance- it is about all of those things and a hundred more. It is about body acceptance regardless of the size, shape, or condition that that body comes in. We want to emphasize that, like all subreddits, this is a community made place. Posters submit articles and questions and images that they feel connected to, or don't see enough of it then please submit- encourages others to submit. 



We, a refuge, for people who need a break from the body shaming, the misogyny, and the constant bombardment of body negative messages. 



So I want to get into some of the don'ts of this subreddit. People tend to think that body shaming is cut and dry- it's not. It's so ingrained, and tips on how to minimize or maximize certain qualities so that their ""more attractive"" parts show through. We, as a society, are all about deceiving through body masking because of an idea that a person's natural body is just not good enough. 



Because the issue has a lot of cultural, I want to emphasize the complexity of body acceptance and body shaming. The mods will often talk to each other about a specific post or a specific comment and decide whether or not it's a body negative comment- we have to have these discussions because it's not always clear. We have to think about how it effects others, the different ways it effects different people, the implications that could be drawn from it, and the subtle backhanded messages that can be hidden. In other words, *it's not easy*



It's important to recognize that body shaming changes from group to group based on social misconceptions. For example



Privilege is ""a special advantage or immunity or benefit not enjoyed by all"". In health that means that thin people are automatically assumed to be healthier than fat people. Though this varies depending on the level of thinness, fat people do get that assumption. So articles like this are challenging common misconceptions- and ones that are incredibly detrimental to the health and well being, both physically and mentally, of larger people. Even among larger people there is [a spectrum of privilege](http://red3.blogspot.com/2011/02/spectrum-of-privilege.html), so it's important to judge on a case by case basis instead of applying hard lined rules when we get into the gray areas. 



Part of body positivity- part of making it positive for *everyone* and not just yourself, in extending empathy and help to those in this community, and in creating a truly positive environment for all. 



The largest privilege denying that the mods have seen going on in r/ba is [thin privilege](http://sugaredvenom.tumblr.com/post/1295697338/thin-privilege-checklist) denying. Now, body shaming techniques, it appears to need some clarification. 



[Thin privilege means that thin people automatically have an overall easier time than their larger counterparts.](http://www.raisingmyboychick.com/2010/08/on-fatphobia-thin-privilege-and-eat-a-sandwich/) This does *not* mean that they have an easy time. It does *not* mean that they do not experience body shaming and it is *very* important to recognize that thin body shaming is not acceptable. What it does mean is that by ""virtue"" of being thin



Fat people receive worse quality of care in the doctor's office, parents of fat children are less likely to pay for their children's college education, they have to pay extra on planes to go the same distance, doctors give them less time and explain less to them, their health concerns are dismissed and blamed on their fat. The list goes on and on, and this is only the direct discrimination. In social settings there are far far more privileges that thin people get. 



It is important to remember that thin is the preferred body type in this country and that anything else is automatically seen as inferior by the general population. Denying thin privilege is no different from a man who says sexism no longer exists and denies his own male privilege- or to claim that sexism is not harmful. It is and so is sizism which is predominantly perpetrated against larger individuals. Thin privilege denying *is* sizism and it *is* body shaming. Don't worry

Wasn't sure if this was better suited for /r/blackladies but I thought I'd give this one a try. Let me start by saying I hope this post doesn't offend anyone but I really have to express this to someone.

I'm black. And I have a black girl's body. Yes, thighs, butts, etc. I also know there are women of other ethnicities with all of those features, but it's a bit more rare. On top of that, the standards of ""perfection"" seem to be different between the two cultures, which is why eating disorders are often considered ""white girl problems."" Black women that aren't naturally curvy are often referred to as being ""shaped like a white girl."" I hope anyone reading this can understand what I mean and not think I'm being a racially stereotypical asshole

Since I started college 6 years ago I spent a lot of time around white people. I was a cheerleader on a squad with only a handful of black girls. I had lots of white friends, but when I saw that he had started seeing a black girl the same complexion as me who was rail thin, I was crushed. 

I was never really overweight, and that was nice, but until I had gotten to a point where white men would find me attractive, I was not thin enough. I should mention that I've never been with a white man and wasn't necessarily trying to attract one; I just wanted to feel like I could. I wanted to be able to borrow my white friends' jeans. I wanted to look like...well, not this. When my extreme diet and exercise regimen didn't seem to be working well enough, I started purging. No one suspected a thing because black girls don't get eating disorders, right? Whenever I hear someone say that

Now I'm out of college and completely in love with a black man who tells me at every chance that he loves my curves. But I'm so unhappy. I gave up alcohol (for personal reasons rather than fitness), you name it. I got down to 130 pounds. Like many black women, I carry my weight in my lower body, so my arms are thin and my collarbones are prominent, but from the waist down, I feel like an absolute monster. I step on the scale and feel like I should feel victorious, then look in the mirror at my thighs and hips and am utterly disgusted. I've had many friends accuse me of trying to ""look like a white girl"" - turn on any rap song and all you hear about is big asses and thick thighs, I know I'll never attain what I'm killing myself to get, keep popping diet pills

This post is about circumcision. I was circumcised at birth. I had always been happy with my penis exactly the way it is until one time I came across a ""cut vs. uncut"" thread on 4chan (not /b/, and not very indicative of what the ‘real’ 4chan is like). They say ignorance is bliss, and in my case, I learned the true meaning of this phrase. I always thought browsing the many different boards of 4chan had made me a more emotionally stable person. Nothing I read on the Internet could upset or anger me. That is until I came across this one thread. I was plunged into a depressive episode for a few weeks by a single troll post. Trolls in threads like that say things to circumcised individuals like ""enjoy never having real sex"" ""your sex life will never be the same now that you know” after posting infographics of the nerves in the foreskin. Now I feel silly talking about this, but this single thread and the posts that the trolls made really put me in a bad place for quite some time. Something I had always been happy with, my penis, was suddenly unsatisfactory. Sex and masturbation are very important to me, were suddenly in chaotic disarray. First

I was born with a birth defect called a hypospadias. A hypospadias affects the penis and it involves an abnormally placed urethral opening, but in my case, it certainly was: my urethral opening was located right at the meeting of the shaft to the head/glans. Even if I wasn’t circumcised at birth, they would have had to remove my foreskin because it was blocking the urethral opening that had to be closed during the surgery. So, if circumcision is “mutilation,” then my penis is extra-super mutilated, because they literally had to slice open my penis lengthwise and re-route my entire urethra. I have a scar running down the length of my shaft on the underside. When it’s flaccid, I contracted a Staph infection. According to my parents, Vancomycin

Fast-forward to me being a teenager. After puberty I discover my sexuality and I crave women. I remember masturbating frequently as a teenager, because that meant it was time to watch hardcore porn and masturbate. Also after puberty, my genitalia grew to their adult size, and I would later find out my penis is above average size: 7 x 5 inches (17.78 x 12.7 cm for the Eurofriends). I discovered something about myself during these times: my sexuality is a part of who I am, and I love it. Never once during any of these times did I ever once think I was “missing out” on anything. 

When I was 16, and I’ve been told I have unusual taste in women (but I’m really just a chubby chaser/ BBW enthusiast) so I have never had a very difficult time getting a girlfriend. Total, I’ve had sex with 12 girls (14 if you count oral sex as sex). Not bad for a man that was born with a penile birth defect almost lost his penis due to a Staph infection. Up until that one fateful thread, I had never ONCE felt like I was “missing out” on anything. I had achieved the totality of sexual satisfaction.

Then when I came across that thread, I always thought it was better to be circumcised than uncircumcised. My state of mind was this: the foreskin is a superfluous flap of skin that can trap smegma and oils, and creates conditions ideal for the survival of viruses and bacteria, so it’s cleaner and healthier to remove it. Then the trolls posted, and I read and saw evidence that sexual pleasure is greater in uncircumcised men than circumcised men. What changed was my view on the issue. The head of the penis is mucous membrane, not skin, so ideally it should be protected. The result of this new knowledge: I was plummeted headfirst into depression and unhappiness. For the first and only time in my life, mutilated, I wanted to circumcise him. 

I’ve always been very happy and self-confident.  I’ve never had many problems with body image or depression. People who know me usually describe me as being a bubbly, which is a very bad idea if you’re in a crisis and self-conscious about something like this. All I found were propaganda website explaining that 100% of circumcised men die as a result of the procedure, and the ones that do survive never experience any sexual pleasure whatsoever. (I’m exaggerating but you get the point). I also wondered what it would be like if I was at a nude beach in Europe or South America. Would people point and laugh at my unnatural johnson?

One day I realized the crisis was over. The thoughts of unhappiness and dread disappeared. I realized feeling bad about something you can’t change is a waste of time, so I finally found the strength to accept what I can’t change. It was because I was able to focus on the positives: I should be lucky to even have a penis in the first place. And not only is it fully functional, it’s bigger than most. Two of the girls I had slept with were grossed out by uncut dicks. If I was uncut, I would have never been able to sleep with those girls. And because of my penis’s unique history, with the surgery and all, I can offer unique perspective on the sexual satisfaction issue. My dick is extra-SUPER mutilated because of the scar and the surgery, and thus even less sensitive than most circumcised penises, not in the penis. Sensitivity just aids in getting you to orgasm faster.

I still get aggravated when I come across places like r/MensRights. I went there today for the first time, posts from men who I would describe as being “beta as fuck.” Men who would kneel before an uncircumcised penis, admitting their “mutilated” penises are inferior in every way, spending the entirety of their lives obsessed with a flap of skin. This makes me mad because I know there are men out there who are circumcised and happy with their circumcisions, but you never seem to come across their voices on the Internet. Their opinions are always discarded in a flurry of anti-Semitic remarks and links to propaganda websites.

When I have a son, and its unique history makes it one of a kind. It is large and capable of giving women pleasure. Using it, I have achieved sexual gratification. I realized that while others are calling my penis mutilated on the internet, I'm too busy bringing my girlfriend to orgasm with my sleek, sculpted pecker to care. So try not to spend time worrying about whose penis is better, and certainly don’t spend time trying to find validation from strangers online, and be happy with the penis you have.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/xsqsl/ignorance_is_bliss_my_rollercoaster_of_emotions/

I have very large labia minora that stick out. I personally find this extremely unattractive. I cant help but look at porn and pictures posted to GoneWild and wonder why I cant have a small cute vagina like all of the other women and feel depressed.

I watched the documentary ""The Perfect Vagina"" and started feeling way better about it... I geared my self up and grabbed a mirror convincing myself it would look better after having a perspective/attitude adjustment from watching the video. I was optomistic...But when I looked in the mirror the same sinking feeling came right back and I couldnt help but think that I have an ugly vagina. 
Something similar has happened with a website called ""The love of large labia"" it is dedicated to helping women appreciate their larger labia and the same thing will happen. I pour over the pictures

My looks dictate my life. I do not consider myself a vain or conceited person

On a bad day I am an introverted wreck and get agitated when someone tries to interact with me. I feel I'm being judged and my self-worth is somehow related to my how I'm perceived. I have 0 confidence (because this shirt does not bring out my good features.) Sometimes someone I like passes by, I'll be ""myself"" tomorrow, you'll see.

There is no middle ground. On a rare good day, and I think to myself ""wow if I could look this good everyday, I could actually have a fantastic social life.""

In reality I know this is not the case. I see people who I would consider far less attractive than me by my standards (this sounds bad but I can't think of an honest nice way of saying it) and they are happy, flirting with others I would consider way out of my league. And they flirt back.


These people all have confidence and I have none. My only source of confidence comes from my hair falling the right way. I feel shallow, but I can't train myself to believe it.

So I ask you 



-EDIT: It seems many of you assumed that I am a female (and understandably so given the forum and the stereotypical context), albeit to a lesser extent. I do recognize, that with the current state of media, women are much more prone to this type of cognitive misdirection, and empathize with that.

Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.

I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size

But when I start to tell them

They think I'm telling lies.

I say

It's in the reach of my arms

The span of my hips

The stride of my step

The curl of my lips.

I'm a woman

Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman

That's me.


I walk into a room

Just as cool as you please

And to a man

The fellows stand or

Fall down on their knees.

Then they swarm around me

A hive of honey bees.

I say

It's the fire in my eyes

And the flash of my teeth

The swing in my waist

And the joy in my feet.

I'm a woman

Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman

That's me.


Men themselves have wondered

What they see in me.

They try so much

But they can't touch

My inner mystery.

When I try to show them

They say they still can't see.

I say

It's in the arch of my back

The sun of my smile

The ride of my breasts

The grace of my style.

I'm a woman


Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman

That's me.


Now you understand

Just why my head's not bowed.

I don't shout or jump about

Or have to talk real loud.

When you see me passing

It ought to make you proud.

I say

It's in the click of my heels

The bend of my hair

the palm of my hand

The need of my care

'Cause I'm a woman

Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman

That's me.

I entered a costume contest recently. I was a character from a cartoon show, how much open scorn, body policing, and just general HATE I would receive for doing so. It's ridiculously depressing.

The thing is, after all. But this is so much worse than what I've dealt with on Reddit, in a way, because they're commenting on my body, not my viewpoints. My body, which I beat up and cut and starved for half my life. My BODY, which I've worked hard to feel comfortable with, which THEY have no fucking right to comment on. It's a goddamn costume contest

Also, incidentally, dressed in the same costume as me. But, there's only one comment on hers, and I don't even know how many on mine. All of the others have no such open hatred, though there are some gross and lewd comments (but are still ""positive"").

The photo is not in my control - it is in the album of the cartoon blog's facebook page, I'd have to post it on the open forum, which would, in turn, open me up for more hate-filled nonsense comments. And I wonder, if I could remove it, should I? I think I would. But then it feels like they win. They win, the chilling effect has already succeeded. I won't be posting in any costume contests

TL;DR - Entered a costume contest. People on the internet talking shit about my body. Feels bad. What do?

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL for your kind words! I messaged the contest people and told them to take the picture down. I also told them that they should put in place rules or guidelines to commenters to only comment on the COSTUMES

But it really got me thinking... everyone should be accepted.  I'll acknowledge that it's been a long night of drinking and my rambling may not be coherent but right now

Why should you be ashamed of doing pull-ups before bed?  You should be proud that you can do them... 90% of the people here can't and it's an accomplishment.   Well maybe, I had big arms and a six pack.  Don't worry; I used a throwaway so this isn't a humbebrag. My friends also noticed the change and that became part of my image... the guy whose always running or lifting or whatever.  So you have a good body - why bother posting in BA?  Because, to share a drunken fear with you all, I am terrified.  I'm so scared of missing a gym week, so scared of losing what I've made of myself.  Will my girlfriend be disappointed if one day I show up with a flat stomach and skinny arms? (naturally high metabolism)  Will my friends think I'm lazy and apathetic if I stop going to the gym to spend more time with them or at home?  I decided that today, I would skip the gym and work on my car and clean my house, and the feeling of guilt that I hadn't worked out

I guess the point of my incoherent rambling is, and that is not ok.  Body acceptance does not mean that just fat people and skinny people should be OK with how they look; it means that everyone should be OK with how they look.  I know that a lot of fit people in the gym are d-bags, but I can assure you that just as many are equally insecure about themselves as you all are.  

A lot of times, being in good shape, I also feel guilty about not being in great shape.  And, being in good shape, I also feel scared to let myself no longer be in good shape.  All of these are unhealthy things, and I guess the point of coming in here is to urge you to not judge a book by its cover.  Discriminating against someone for being fit is just as wrong as discriminating against someone for being under/over weight... they too may have the same body images that you possess.

1336781538.0,tizme,"Hi girls, here are tips/advices that helped me to love and accept my body the way it is.  Wanted to share this with you, hope it will be helpful !",pennylanemiller,25,8

First of all, I apologize for it !

I hated my body since I was a kid. I've never been overweighted, and from that day, It never started. 
I finally realized that my body had NOTHING wrong

This is only based on my own experience, but if only one phrase helps you, I will have achieve something ! 
Here it is

- SPORT. This is what had worked the best for me. Recconects you with your body. And this is not at all about how muscular you look if you exercise - I actually don't exercise enough for that. But whenever I feel fat, because it reminds you that your body is effective, healthy, and that you're doing something good for it. Plus, when you exercice on a regular basis, you will notice the positive effects very quickly. More strenght, less difficulties to breathe
Also

- EAT HEALTHY. Same thing than for sports : not for being thinner or anything. Just because it feels good to know you're doing something good for your body. Also, and be in a better mood, and be more encline to be positive about your body (and other things too)
But eating healthy doesn't mean you have to feel bad when you eat somethin that is supposed to be ""bad"" for the body; on the contrary

- Stop reading magazines. Top models are not reality. First of all, friends, relatives, people you see in the street.
Real people

- Think positive. It had been said and said so I'm not gonna extend a lot about it, my legs are beautiful the way they are, because they are mine, I love them
the way they are. Plus

- Don't get caught by the fashion industry. I don't know how to formulate it
You're supposed to look the way you are, people are supposed to accept you the way you are (and if they don't, well, foret them, they don't deserve your love and friendship)

- Read books about how women have been ""trained"" from ages to hate their bodies. The best book I read about it is [""*Mon corps est un champ de bataille*""](http://ma.colere.free.fr/spip.php?rubrique4)  (""*My body is a battlfield*"") Don't know if there is a enlish version of this one,  but as women we have been taught very young that we are supposed to suffer to be beautiful, find a man, and have babies. because after all, we are only here to carry babies and give birth in suffering. Our bodies are made to suffer, they are supposed to be painful. THAT IS FUCKING UNTRUE. Your body is supposed to be your ally, not your ennemy. It is not here to be a source of pain

- SEX. My sexlife was not really great when I hated my body. Not confident with your body = not relaxed in bed = bad sex = low self esteem ( "" I can't even appreciate sex
Better self esteem in your body = more confident in bed = better sex = gain in self confidence etc...
Plus

- KNOW your own body. Look at yourself
But even if it's harsh on the beggining
Compliment yourself about what you like in your body.
Then look at the parts that you dislike,
whenver you think something like "" I hate my boobs they are ridiculously small compared to how big my ass is"" Add something like "" BUT they are also firm, try to erase the negative things about it: ""Wow, I'm lucky to have boobs like that - so firm, and what a nice shape !"" even if you don't truly believe it at first.
With time and pratice

If it's really to hard for you to look fully naked in the mirror, do the same for the lower part (and vice versa)

Knowing your body is really important

Too many people treat their body like a total stranger
to make things easier"" 
You can't love your body without knowing it. Sport is also helping to know it - learn its limits

AND know your body sexually too. Look at your vagina in a mirror. Know it. Don't think it's ugly because of the shape or the color or the hair or anything (their is also a great book about that, it is normal because only porn stars have one like that. And it's because they had surgery. True story !)
All that makes you more confident in bed

- Don't mistreat your body with diets and other things. It will only reenforce the negative thoughts about it. If you arm your body
Be nice with it : put cream
You take care of things you like. If you take care of your body

- UNDERWEARS. First
So find your real size, because a well chosen bra can make a real difference on how a top look on you.
Same for panties : take them at your size. If it's too small you will feel uncomfortable. It will cut your blood circulation
Underwears that fits you will flatter your body

Secondly
you gain confidence in your body.

My entire life I have never felt comfortable with my body, and being the oldest of three girls I was constantly criticized and scrutinized for the way I looked and compared to everyone around me ( skin too dark, hair too short, too fat, etc. ) But also being of mixed race ( My father is Italian / Irish ) I never properly fit into the Asian community, I was ""different"" looking, and looking different is a big deal when everyone is striving hard to blend into what is ""proper"" and ""respectable"" there. When I moved to America, but the situation didnt change. I didn't fit in with the american / white kids at my school, when I was 8 years old I had my two front teeth kicked out by two boys during recess ( obviously my baby teeth ) they had given me a black eye as well. When I was 10 a few girls ganged up on me and shoved me down a flight of concrete steps and I was severely injured, and ever cried or cracked in public
Hair - I hate everything about it. Its ugly, cut poorly. I hate the length, the color, my bangs are hideous. It gets greasy quickly, the texture is ugly and I feel like I am losing hair, and that it’s thin. Has no volume or style and it looks dead. I can see my scalp alot.
Face - I hate the shape of my face. From thr front it is round like a moon, almost like a pan. My jawline is atrocious, I have an overly small chin, double chin and turkey neck fat. I have a bulbous overly round nose that reminds me of a clown nose. I have disgusting acne prone oily skin that feels constantly greasy and bumpy and even tons of makeup cant hide it. It is red and irritated and scarred and disgusting. My eyebrows are sparse and grow weirdly. I have almost no eyelashes. I grow a mustache. My smile is horrifyingly disfigured. I hate to smile. I hate it I hate it I hate it. My teeth arr extremely crooked and misshapen, I dont take photos while smiling. I am my most ugly when I am smiling, and the most uncomfortable. I will never be happy to smile. I hate smiling. I have no photos of me smiling.
Body - I have a very short and fat neck like a stump. I have fat shoulders and poor posture so I have a large humpback. I have very fat upper arms and there are stretchmarks. I have very fat ugly boyish fingers, and a barreled ribcage so i look disfigured. I have absolutely no waist whatsoever, and an enourmous huge gigantic gut covered in stretchmarks that makes me look like i am pregnant and it is just a huge ugly fat flab that hangs over my pants. You cannot see hip bones because i have such a fat stomach. I have love handles that are set too high on my body so it is like a saddle bag and i look disfigured. I am so fat when i bend it makes a huge roll on my sides. I have a huge belly button from all the fat in my swollen nasty gut. I have a weird back because i am hunched. I have a flabby cellulite jiggly pancake butt. It is small flat and ugly. My butt crack is always hanging out because i have no butt to fill into my jeans. I have a fat vagina that is an ugly brown color. I have fat cellulite thighs that touch together. I have stretchmarks. I have short stumpy ugly legs and big calves. I have ugly dry feet. And short dtumpy fat arms. My skin is an ugly color, and i have weird tan patterns.
I re-read this and realized there is actually not a single part about my body I even find remotely attractive, understanding, compassionate, open minded, and strong. But outside I feel like I look like something out of a horror film. It gives me anxiety to think about the way I look when I will be standing there with the man I love exchanging vows on my wedding day. I can't even think about having photos taken, and how sad he must feel when I explained to him I cannot smile in our wedding photos. At the same time I feel like these are such silly / stupid things to feel upset over, yet I still feel upset over them anyways. And my lovely man, gorgeous, I tend to avoid mirrors, I want to love myself and be a confident bride. I just don't even know where to begin in all of this. I hate how I look so much to the point where it has made me cry. I have nothing positive about my body or physical looks whatsoever. It is defeating at times. I want to love myself and I have been trying to for years

It's not my face I mind; it's my body. I can manage well by not really looking in the mirror all that much. When I don't look in the mirror

I used to have a compulsion to look in the mirror all the time, I'll be graduating high school soon. I'm a little stressed out with school, but it's nothing I can't handle. Literally, the thing I hate most about my life is my body. Now, I've always been insecure, and my body hatred has gotten worse with my ED. Apparently, I had a warped view of myself because even at my lowest weight, at my lowest weight was the only time I sort of liked how I looked. So

To get specific, short. So, already, I get people commenting on that. To get very specific, the part I hate most about myself is my thighs, and my hips. I feel like they look like these huge, monstrous tree trunks that do not fit with the rest of my body. I'm a runner, it does not at all fit with what I think I *should* look like

I don't know what to do when I start obsessing over this. Seriously

Sometimes, I don't love how I look, but I can live with it. But other times, I can't stand it. I think I look absolutely terrible, and I think, how could that be me? 

My therapist told me that, but I hope that it hasn't, because I desperately hope that what I see in the mirror isn't actually what I look like.

I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to get by because, about how much I can't stand my body. I eat healthy and run pretty much everyday, but I feel like my body does not look as it should with all of my effort. I feel like this is a huge detriment to my life.

I'm in my mid 20s and all my life I've battled against obesity. I can proudly say I'm just a bit chubby and no longer obese. I have lost nearly 100 lbs in under a year.

Unfortunately the trauma from never being ""hot"" has taken a toll on my mental health. I find myself trying my best to say that I am lovely and these huge hips are sexy. But in the end

I'm bitter because I've never had the hot teen girl body. I've never known what it's like to have perky breasts. My breasts are weird and malformed. The nipple sits at an odd angle and even worse when I'm laying on my side. The fat shifts and sags down to my side. A weird visual as it's difficult to describe in words but I don't think I'm brave enough to post a pic to really let you know how weird and ugly my breasts are. 

I'd really love to say that I did this to myself, my mother would feed me all organic foods and vegetables. I always ate healthy. She'd sign me up for activities such as dancing and martial arts but my weight just grew out of control. Doctors tested for any imbalances but there was no answer. I feel like I'd be less hateful if I had done this to myself, like sat on my ass all day and ate junk...

I don't know what to do. I've successfully lost weight, oddly shaped wide body for being short. My breasts are my biggest insecurity and my huge huge huge hips make me want to scream in anger.

Why me? I feel like I was punished for something I did in my past life (If I believed in that sort of crap that is). I try every day to tell myself I'm beautiful. I look at myself in the mirror naked and force a smile and I try so hard to accept and embrace myself

I don't know what to do.

But I have no conception of how to be comfortable with my body. Everything about being thin to me is a matter of working to be thinner. I haven't been able to get used to being thin without cutting calories and counting them meticulously. I guess what I'm saying is that I have no conception of what living at this size is like. I certainly don't think living like this is sustainable.

Ever since I can remember, you're either ""thin"" or ""fat"". 

No in betweens. 

Anyways. I recently started liking my body and started wearing shorts and dresses for the first time and actually feeling good about it.

Until I got home from college.

During Mother's Day, ""Yes. You look like it."" 

I. Was. Pissed.

I told him, ""Do you exercise?"" I said, ""I rock climb, but I've been too busy recently. I go to the gym when I can."" He asked, ""Are you sure?""

I really wish this didn't upset me as much as it did,""You need to work out more"", etc. What I hate even more is that I have to get my confidence back up AGAIN. I know I'm not the thinnest of goddess-looking, but I was actually happy and enjoyed wearing awesome clothes. Now I just keep thinking ""He's a product of this society, so he must know what looks good."" and it's killing me inside.

Last year my dad got really ill, this syndrome was the cause of his sudden illness. There is a bit of uncertainty because genetic testing for such syndromes takes ages and he was taken ill very rapidly, so details of exact causes of his illness are still coming to light. People in his family have always died young, and they think it was this undiagnosed syndrome that caused those sudden deaths. He’s still recovering, and has had multiple surgeries to make him better again. 

Where I come in is that it’s a genetically inherited syndrome, MMA and yoga immediately with my physio stating that she was shocked I hadn’t done myself serious injury. The doctor confirmed this about two weeks later. 

My problem is that though I now have both an explanation for everything I had thought a bit odd about myself (but had always just shrugged off); as well as an early warning system for possible heart and other organ failures
I can’t do things that I used to love doing; I have to be careful around activities that I thought I was fine doing. I don’t feel like my body belongs to me

What can I do to accept this? How do I move forward and stop being scared of doing things like exercise? I know my disability isn’t as bad as other people’s

So I'm 26, though to me it seems meaningless nowadays. I dropped almost all my excess weight (I was near obese at 265) and then gained weight back in muscle. I'm now in the best shape of my life. I've picked up new hobbies that I enjoy (when not in my head), and do volunteer work every weekend. I've worked incredibly hard on my social skills, learning correct posture, the advantages of maintaining eye contact, and making sure I smile at people. I've put a shit ton of work also into my wardrobe and style, making sure I always leave the house looking my best, and getting higher-end hair cuts from salons. I even got my college degree and have interviews lined up for much better jobs. I also always try to force myself to go out and meet people

Yes I might be a much better person overall than I was before, and have had the unfortunate experiences of having people tell me the same thing in person (both friends (kindly) and strangers (not so much)). So when I put my pictures on somewhere like /r/amIugly, and they only tell me I'm not too ugly to date, I still feel like they just are focusing my story, and not on my looks due to me not having much. I see other guys put pictures on there and women say stuff like ""would definitely date"", but I never get these kinds of comments.

My apologies for getting kinda off topic with my fixation on looks (though I feel like it's my biggest hindrance), but it has slowly flooded my mind to the point it's all I think about, and it has made me miserable to the point of considering suicide (I'm not actively suicidal, so no need for links to /r/suicidewatch). Until I get a full time position with benefits which include coverage for a therapist, therapy isn't an option for me (no one in my area is accepting patents under sliding scale either).

happy. When I am writing, or near my family, I do not need to fill my heart with a junk shot of food (healthy or not).

It is not simple laziness that has made me this way. It is a series of events and feelings, criticisms, even compliments taken the wrong way that have degraded my image of myself. I think only people in my situation understand ""I'm depressed because I'm fat, I'm fat because I'm depressed.""

Every body needs to find its own path in its own time. I am tired of people saying, but I need to find my own way.

Anecdote. In high school, and anemia. Blood disorders run in my dad's side. This was fixed by moving to California and low-dose iron pills. I didn't do anything besides that.

But for the longest time, I got shit for ""making all other women feel bad"", because I look the way I do (I have an hourglass shape but I'm very small) and I eat utter crap. This saddens me, because I've always thought that all women are beautifully themselves. I'd never try to make others feel bad about their bodies.

Relatives would tell me I need to eat because I ""haven't grown into a woman yet"".

I move downward. My shoulders, the shame I felt when I knew they'd be seeing my breasts. The disappointment I saw on their faces when they looked at me.

My stomach. Skinnyfat.  All my weight goes here. Sometimes I feel like my stomach is the core of negativity

My hips and ass are no better. Tiny

Every day

Sometimes I feel like no one will ever love me because of this body. Though I'm technically considered thin, like less of a human being, because I don't have that ""womanly"" shape or conventional attractive face prized by the rest of society.

When it comes to men, and was in love with him. We clicked mentally, but when the clothes came off, he wanted nothing to do with me, and rejected my attempts at sex many times. He said it was because he was nervous, and had performance issues. But then we broke up, and days later, who was gorgeous and had a perfect hourglass figure. I'm convinced it was my looks and lack of curves that pushed him away. I would love to date again

I'm tired of perpetuating this stereotype of ""girl with body issues."" I honestly just want to feel normal. But I feel like I can't feel normal without my body changing as well.

This includes buying new clothes, I still do struggle with negative thoughts sometimes.

I am in a much better place now than I was a year ago. I am an avid runner, and I think that knowing that I need to eat enough so that I can be a strong runner helped me a lot. I've also been seeing a therapist, though I will not be seeing her once I go to college.

I used to be about twenty pounds heavier than I am now, and now I am at a healthy weight. But I am afraid of gaining weight again. I used to feel uncomfortable in my own skin when I was heavier, which I am sure fueled my ED (along with other, personal issues), so I mostly stuck to wearing baggier clothes. Now, I am still the same way, though I have been gaining more confidence in the way I look, which would mean having to go out and buy new clothes to wear. But I'm terrified of buying these new clothes

When I was at that higher weight, I am much more conscientious. As soon as I started running, I began losing weight, but then, before I ever leveled out, I spiraled downward into an ED, and then I had to crawl out of that hole that I'd dug for myself. I consider my life now to be much healthier than it ever was in the past.

I guess I am nervous about this because college is a new environment. I will not be eating the same foods I do now, and I will be joining my school's club cross-country team, so I will still be running. I know that I can't just gain twenty pounds in a night, but I am afraid of it sneaking up on me. I was just so uncomfortable with myself when I was at that high weight, so I don't know how to quell my fears about this now. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice for me.

I'm 23 years old, my face barely grows patchy bits of stubble, and I have a naturally boyish looking face.  My hair is naturally curly too, which has also contributed greatly to my insecure body image over the years as well (I think it makes me look even younger).  My last girlfriend said it made me look like a ""cherub"" -.-  Which she said she liked, but it's still hard for me to accept nonetheless.  I'm insecure about all of these things and I'm insecure that I'm insecure about them.  I feel like it's stuff I shouldn't worry about, but I do.

Just found this community.. seem like a great group of ladies and gents who might be able to help me. I'm 26 years old. I've struggled with my weight as long as I can remember. My mother and sisters are the same. My mother told me to go on a diet when I was in kindergarten. I was constantly teased for being fat. In middle school, I was 325lbs. At this point, I decided to have weight loss surgery. I got the Lap-Band in 2007. At my lowest weight, I was 200lbs, which was a 125lb loss. I lost 10 dress sizes.

The secret that nobody knew was that I was also bulimic. I was bulimic before the surgery. I used laxatives. After the surgery, I knew it would eventually, but it was disappointing. It's sort of how weight loss surgery works.. you have your big loss but you have to maintain it yourself after those first couple of years. 

In any case... I had a boyfriend (who became my husband, my weight went up and down. I've been at 220 for awhile now. My mother still comments on my weight and eating habits constantly. It hurts me very much.

In order to start over, strongest urges to start purging again (I stopped right before I left to teach overseas). I don't want to do that. I don't want to hurt myself anymore.

I don't want to be like this. I am making healthy changes just to feel better (more fruits and veggies, so it isn't my weight, but still..). I want to feel sexy for my boyfriend who loves my body. 

I need help. I need to read a book. I need someone to talk to.

Time passed. I became indulgent of physical pleasures. Sex, I was gluttonous for pleasure for enjoyment. I wanted to consume whole my life and burn out fast and beautiful. I danced and drank, I was a good chaotic wild person. 

Time passed, it was my body I must have been undesirable I said. I got depressed and I ate and I ate and I ate. I gained a lot of weight. Then one night when he didn't come home (I might add he was a drug dealer) I got scared he was not okay, I called him I called all his friends, and finally I tracked him down and he was drunk and he said ""get off my fucking nuts or I'll start treating you like I treat my mom and I only call her on the holidays."" then he hung up on me. I went to the bedroom and I sat there thinking about killing my self. I've never been suicidal except for that one moment, and something in my brain snapped. I knew this was wrong, I was better than this I deserved better. I got up called my friends and asked them to come over with empty trunks. I packed all my things in a few hours and in one large caravan I left. 

Time passed, like with knives. I'm sure this is not healthy. what is worse Is I'm afraid to really talk to anyone about it. I'm afraid to admit there is a problem. I cut my calories down so low that I'm losing weight pretty fast now... But I feel tired and sad all the time. I know what I'm doing is wrong and I want to stop.

I've never posted on this site before
I am female
I used to be anorexic

My problem is that despite this, which is something which has plagued my life even before I started hating my body as a whole. I feel incredibly shallow and ungrateful, because, though I have a few minor health problems, there is nothing seriously wrong with me, and I know I should be thankful that I am a generally healthy person every day of my life. I know this, but for some reason when I catch a sight of myself in the mirror I forget all this and begin to tear myself apart. 

Also I am always looking at other women and comparing myself to them

I am currently in a relationship with a wonderful guy who constantly tells me how much he likes the way I look, and I really hate myself when I have days where I can't help but say the most horrible things about the way I look in front of him, he really doesn't deserve to hear me be so emotionally abuse to myself (it sounds strange, but this is really how I feel I behave sometimes!)

I don't know what to do really

A short while ago I asked /r/amIugly if I was ugly. I got a cascade of responses that *if I wore makeup* I *would* be hot.

Excuse me? What

“But Gashcat

No. Fuck you. Men don’t have to ‘embellish’ anything. Why? Why is that? 

If I’m unattractive, and women are expected by society to bend over backwards? When did natural fall out of favor? So many girls on AmIUgly are told ""throw on makeup!"" It's like an equivalent to ""Hit the gym.""

I just don't understand it. The whole ""if"" factor just boggles my mind. If my face isn't good enough

And I don't want to be told I *have* to be if I ever want to attract a guy...That part in particular is just depressing and perhaps the most wishful part of this little tirade I have going...

I don't have anything against choosing to wear makeup for fun



On a more BA note, and not in an interesting, angular way, but in a bulbous squashed kind of way, and I can't put my finger on what is wrong with the bottom half of my face but there just *is* and I feel just awful about my looks. The only thing I like about it is my eyes and my hair but of course everyone tells me just to straighten it... I have tried makeup. To be honest it looked like it didn't belong on my face.

The problem is, I weighed 245 lbs (at 5'10""). I always had this idea in my head that one day I'd lose a bunch of weight and I'd feel so good about myself and that's when things would get better for me. Well, miraculously, I actually did that. I had gotten up to about 265, and someone bought me a step counter for Christmas, and I actually used it, and I got down to 185 at the lowest. The problem is that I had set my sights on 170 and at that point, but I get really frustrated because it didn't really make that much difference in my life

In the mean time, and as a result, I just couldn't imagine a woman being attracted to me. As I've gotten older, more of my peers have put on weight, yet they all seem to be able to accept themselves as they are and believe that women find them attractive, while I anxiously imagine that they all are happy to be my friends but they don't find my physique appealing.

It didn't bother me at the time, and when my aunt constantly told me I had fat legs whenever she came over. After several years of on-and-off cycles of binge eating and starving myself for no reason, edging on anorexia at one point, I am okay with my body. I've found peace with myself through something I love: sport and exercise. I am an athlete, and I have an athlete's body. I am able to run up several flights of stairs without being winded and lift weights equivalent a freaking BEAR. So why do I doubt that I have a beautiful body right now? 

This friend and I have been 'best friends' for close to a decade. She's not a bad friend, especially online. It's like she doesn't know that some of the things she says are really offensive. She has gained a lot of weight and a lot of curves in the last few years. Recently, she started to love her body, and I'm extremely proud of her for that. But she has also begun peck at my lack of breasts whenever there is a chance for her to, and will then proceed to makes sure that my other friend and I know that unlike me, she has jugs of feminine fat on her chest. Why do people do this? I feel extremely insecure about it, but I'm trying to fight it. 

Earlier today, it will draw more attention to your 'problem area'. Instead, wear ___, to hide it!"" I don't feel like I need to fluff up my almost-flat-chested-ness by wearing ruffles where my boobs should be. I don't need to wear an A-Line or puffy skirt to make it look like I have hips proportional to my broad shoulders. I don't have to avoid 3/4 sleeves or tight tops because that would make me look 'more lanky' and accentuate my lack of a defined waistline. I will wear whatever the hell I want to because I feel good in them, and they will help me perform in competitions. I am not abnormal because I don't have the proportions of everyone else.

With that said, or my fast, powerful legs just because they don't fit in with the general consensus for what is 'beautiful'? I am not going to change myself to look a certain way for society to be okay with looking at me, I will look like however I want to. I will choose my clothes, my clothes don't get to choose me.

I read it

I come from a family of chunky women. Not a one of us is thin. All of us are pretty busty, wavy hair. We are pretty average looking as a group. And as far as I have come with regards to accepting myself for what I am (mom of 4, victim of stretch marks), and being comfortable with myself (and I am)... I come here all the time and upvote, mod or comment on women that are so incredibly hypercritical of themselves because I want you all to know that you are OK, exactly the way that you are.  Be healthy and be happy and love yourselves. 

And when I saw that link, because I wouldn't want any guys to feel worse about this kind of thing or more insecure than they already are. This was my very first thought! Well, that and I have certainly lied about it like a rug in past situations and I wouldn't want anyone to think that women were a bunch of liars. 

In this sub, or shame people that don't fit into their ideal. And it's a constant battle to keep up with removing comments or banning. 

I wondered what would happen if women started telling the truth about something like this? If hypercritical commentary were suddenly directed at something that they had that was lacking? Women as a group are constantly being compared to an ideal that is often very genetic. We can't all have model perfect bodies

I have really spent a lot of my life trying not to hurt other people's feelings and mostly as a result of being bullied for various things. It wouldn't even occur to me to just insult someone for any reason. And as a mom

I've struggled with ED and felt myself slipping back into that some. When I brought this concern up to my SO


Then this happened. While talking to my SO last week over Skype (we're in a LDR at the moment), so continued support of my initial goal would make sense. **But.** What I heard was every insecurity I've had about my body confirmed by someone I care about deeply. What I heard was a clear, direct connection between my weight and my attractiveness/sexiness that I immediately connected to my self-worth. I just broke down. 


This conversation is still bothering me after talking with my SO about it that night and afterwards. I've noticed huge urges to binge and purge, which is a good sign. I tried bringing my concerns about these urges to my SO and my mom, the two most supportive people I have in my life. Both gave a ""But you look so great! You've done so much work! Keep it up!"" What. The. Fuck. Logically I can't expect them to really get it, but I did expect them to trust my sense of knowing when I'm not ok. Without having them grounding me, I'm starting to doubt my own concerns.


I know my body acceptance needs to come from me. I'm trying and trying not to let this unravel YEARS of work. I'm mindful enough to know when I'm in dangerous territory requiring some outside help and grounding. Trying to ask for extra support before I get in too deep seemed like a great idea until my fears were totally invalidated, so hopefully that helps some. In the meantime, *am I going completely insane*? Are my concerns really totally invalid?

Sorry for the long post.

So I was anorexic
As you can read
For sometime I was around 110-115 pounds, along with other sport three times a week.

[The only nice photo of me from now](http://i.imgur.com/3I1KC.jpg)

[I used to be so much thinner.](http://i.imgur.com/kVapH.jpg)
This was when I was wonderful 115 pounds and felt great.



So now I am 130 pounds

But I feel bad about myself, but now I am afraid of dressing like that.

I feel like people would think I would look stupid to dress in cute and colourful now

But I just feels like this applies to me, I haven't had time to go to sleep early, nor do I feel like I deserve anything I want. 

I feel like my boyfriend is really unlucky to be with a person like me and I feel like I don't deserve being happy

Sorry about wenting and all

It wasn't too bad for the first few months of our relationship. At least, I didn't allow him to touch the areas of my body that I don't like, sex was strictly to take place in pitch black darkness. I don't really have those problems as much anymore. I undress in front of him quite often, but I do still have bad days/weeks where I need to change in another room or with the lights off. I get bad skin breakouts on my back and I have red bumps on my arms, and I'm a bit on the thicker side. I have lost a lot of weight, though.

I don't get it, and the man should have the right to choose to undergo the procedure or not. But why do people go out of their way trying to psychologically assault cut men? For instance, I came across [this Yahoo Answers page](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306103532AABR72T) on why Michael Angelo's statue of David looks uncut when David was Jewish. Scroll down 3 or 4 posts to see the troll posts. None of them are answering the question, they're just railing against the procedure and saying how much sensitivity you lose, and how you'll never enjoy sex, and how you're mutilated, and your manhood was stolen at birth, there are always some circumcised men also railing against the procedure

I was circumcised at birth, I would have had to undergo the procedure anyway, because my urethral opening was misplaced underneath the foreskin. In other words, it was doomed from the start. So I'm a special case, but I happen to like my penis. From the surgery to correct my birth defect, I have a scar from where I had the stitches running lengthwise down the shaft. Not many people can say they have such a unique penis. I got a Staph infection after the surgery, and I literally almost lost my penis. Fortunately I was cured by antibiotics, let alone a larger-than-average and fully functional one. 

So I take offense when people make comments about mutilation, would these same people go out of their way to let him know how he's missing out on walking and running? No. But when they find out someone is circumcised, they go out of their way to torment and bully him psychologically about how he's not a complete man, and he'll never know what ""real sex"" feels like. Why is it not okay for a man to be happy with his penis? Please, if you are one of these people, explain yourself. I understand your intentions to save the babies. But why must you torment men who are cut?",,self,,

1343709755.0,xfly0,I'm a guy and I have low weight issues and low self esteem. Everything is emotionally piling up. ,lankyd,14,0,20,"Everyone around me


and I start to feel like shit about the whole thing and it's starting to really bother me. I just find it amazing how it's so accepted to point out someone's weight

Recently I've had a lot of run ins with people making random comments and it sort of piled up emotionally...

Right now I'm feeling extremely self conscience

I'm really lonely but at the same time I have low self esteem...I can never make that jump into any intimacy with any girl I date..due to my self esteem...thus I eventually just stop. Sometimes I talk to women I'm interested in and and ask myself what the point of even talking to them is...because I'll eventually stop. To add to my pressures and anxieties I'm a virgin..and I'm inexperienced so I feel extremely scared of telling someone or meeting some girls that are more experienced than me because of the stigma of my inexperience. sometimes i can't imagine why or how a girl would like me

I have a ton of issues that gather up together to make this terrible concoction of frustration, lack of self esteem, self consciousness. i'm very aware of all this and it's frustrating, I just want to break out..I feel trapped.


I dislike how my face looks, I dislike my low weight which makes me feel inferior and unmanly..and weak, I dislike my lack of success in life, I dislike my depression, I dislike my body hair, I dislike my lack of muscle.

I dislike my loneliness

I feel very emasculated as a guy

I really dislike my face

I hate the fact that even if I gain weight my face will still look terrible and shitty

I dress very well in a way that compliments my body, hygiene to maintain what little confidence i have so I'm okay with any advice on that.


For example I have a girl who's a friend who always comments on my weight. Also all my guy friends give me shit about it too

I was out on a date with a girl a couple days ago and she commented on how I was really skinny and asked me for my weight

everyone mentions it

even my parents make fun of me

I haven't been going to the gym since I got better due to various things..it took me forever to get over my fear of going to the gym and having people watch me. I have another issue of not having much food because I'm broke and my mom doesn't cook(pathetic i know)

i'm depressed and self conscious about my weight, and it distances me from people and makes me feel very scared to get close to people. i constantly feel like people point out my weight. i'm very low right now. i keep looking at my face and the bags under my eyes...even in my face it shows...the sadness..I have a lot of wrinkles.

So I started reading it and it's the type of book that pisses you off every single chapter because this is *not* what you've been told your whole life.. you're told, if you just stop being so (insert whatever) then you will lose weight and then everyone will love you and life will be roses and sunshine- being thin is the key to happiness after all, right? But after the anger came the sadness.. because, once you believe what the book is saying, you realize that your dreams of being thin (the fantasy of thin) isn't really real.. and you're not going to get there by dieting. 

I was dieting when I read the book.. counting calories.. the more I counted the less I ate until I was down to 300 a day or so. I felt like crap. A few days after I finished the book I stopped. The other day I wanted cupcakes... but I felt so incredibly awful for wanting to make them that I decided to go ahead and make them just because no food is allowed to make me feel *that* bad. They were vegan chocolate cupcakes with chocolate icing- and they were good! :-) 

Since reading that book I've stopped dieting, and I signed up on the website ModelMayhem.com and already have two shoots set up. I asked the question that started this subreddit and I'm so glad for it. I never would have had the confidence to do any of it without that book.

I used to think that while men do tend to gravitate towards the cultural norm, and I know I'm not one of them based off of what they say. In the few and brief relationships I have had, the guys often get shit about dating a bigger girl, and at least in one occasion has lead to a breakup. I am coming to the conclusion that it doesn't matter who I am, or all the awesome stuff I do, or how funny I am, how kind or... anything. It just seems that guys who want relationships go after what they are attracted to first

Not that I have a problem getting laid. Quite the opposite. Since my last relationship ended 6 years ago I have occasionally hooked up with acquaintances or friends of friends, I discovered, they just want to have sex, and nearly any vagina will do. I just happened to be the one that said 'sure'. The more often that happened, with the guy not calling back unless he wanted to get laid again, or not wanting to hang out unless sex was on the table, the less interested I became in sex. I was beginning to wonder what was wrong with me, and I rarely do. 

Since my last relationship imploded I've been having a hard time letting anyone in. He was the one who's friends had an issue with my size, I think he was the first person I ever allowed myself to love in that way. Since then I've been on 6 to 8 first dates in the past 6 years, mostly on purpose. I'm just not trying anymore, and the guys I did end up going to dinner with were just didn't click with me. 

I've lost nearly 45 pounds in the past year, and gross. I belong to a camping community where clothing is optional and I have many good friends there. It's probably the least judgmental place on the planet when it comes to body type, and I've seen all shapes, sizes, able and disabled folks there in all manner of undress, and to me it's all good. Other people's nudity doesn't bother me one bit, and I always encourage others to push boundaries. But one day I went over to a friend's house, all sitting on the floor, because I know it's not something that should bother me, repellent

Thing is, I think I'm becoming one of those bitter 40 yr olds that'll knit sweaters out of their pet's fur and talk angrily about how the opposite sex and how it's so much better being alone, because talking up being alone is better than feeling like you have no choice.

For the first time since I was 11, only now I have to wait a few weeks if not months.

When I've told people how I view myself, people I actually genuinely believe that care. Coupled with reassurance and compliments that are designed to help, it actually makes the situation worse. Because I just feel like saying ""Don't lie to me.""

Other people, not as aware as my friends are about some of the things I've been through in my life (sexual abuse, rape, psychological trauma and manipulation), usually greet me with a stern, and even amused. ""Don't be ridiculous. There's nothing wrong with you."" Amused, like it's a joke I've just told them

Since I was 11 my coping mechanism was to bottle all my feelings away. If I just pretended that the issues weren't there, wasn't happy at all, it was just a facade. I broke up with my partner of seven years because I want her to be happy, and I've always thought I was holding her back. She doesn't think the relationship is over, and keeps trying to convince me to let her help, to let her be with me and support me. But I don't think I can do this with her worrying at me, and telling me it'll be alright in the end when she doesn't know for sure if it will be. No one knows.

I'm so scared that I'll go to therapy, or make everything even worse. 

I don't even know if I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I reached out yesterday after curving a panic attack and found a BDD chat room to talk to someone. All I got was ""That's not BDD. That's just low self esteem"".  How is that supposed to help me?  If I have self esteem issues like you say

I'm supposed to be wearing a bikini for the first time in years next week...I just went from excited to terrified over night. ,Malcriao,16,5,16,"I'm so excited for this vacation, lovely town.  I'm only 18 and I work these crazy 10-12 hour shifts and I haven't had more than one day off work in forever.  So basically

I was there last summer as well, or anything really.  Silly, right?  I feel like since then I have come a long way.  I've started lifting weights, and holy has that boosted my confidence.  I have these muscles Ive never had before, and strength I never thought I'd have. I've learned that the layer of fat I keep over my muscle is healthy, it's just the way I'm built.  There have even been times when I've liked my figure! A lot!

I thought this year I was going to kick ass on the beach! I was all ready to bust out my salsa moves and maybe meet some cool people.  I bought this ADORABLE little black bikini.  Something I would never have even considered before.  I tried it on, 'oh gurl, look at your hips in this! you're fuckin hot! dang mami you fine'. I talk to myself in my head like that when I'm feelin good.  

Oh man

I didn't notice any of those little imperfections I usually loose my mind over -*I'm looking at you awkward bra strap area fat*- which admittedly aren't even that bad! Hell even my ass

Fuck yeah. 

Well

I know I look the same in the clothes, mostly just skin and a thin layer of pizza and beer.  Whatever, I'm healthy.  I know I am.  So why don't I feel good anymore?

Has this happened to any one else? It's like I woke up and all the confidence I had just died and now I'm depressed and terrified of going on this vacation because I don't want anyone seeing my  chubbies.  I don't know how to overcome this!  It's so illogical and it seems so silly

I want to enjoy this vacation so bad
