1376578839.0,1kf6pm,Corruption in San Antonio,jefsr,198,47,61,"In 1982 the City of San Antonio created a monthly billing account (commonly known as the variable) to consolidate and pay monthly department phone bills received from SBC (the phone company). 


Corrupt City employees and officials discovered that the unaudited account provided unlimited clandestine access to City Department
 
They circumvented the law, OMB regulations, etc. when they submitted fraudulent requests to the Finance Department under the guise of paying the monthly phone bills when in fact they were obtaining funds with no competitive bidding, no Council approval, no public review, no vote, no ordinance, no accountability, etc. The “variable” account grew with every illegal transaction until it totaled about $ 5.2 million annually.
 
 
As the City’s new Telecommunications Manager I discovered that the IT department had over 240 employees BUT the “telephone/pager/cell phone/voice group had just 5 employees and almost no money. Months of research exposed the illegal scheme to drain telephone budgets across the board over the past decades. Every report, etc. I touched was false. I reported the fraud and theft that crippled my ability to support the City’s phone- 911 systems. The City immediately began to hide the crimes rather than investigate and expose the long term theft and fraud. They have been lying ever since (many times under oath in court and in sworn depositions/affidavits) to hide the massive fraud. The City removed my civil service protection in February 2006 and terminated me with no reason and no public hearing. They needed to keep the fraud/theft secret.
 
Three years later the City conspired to defraud our courts in a February 2009 whistleblower trial when city attorney Deborah Klein and attorney Mark Kosanovich coached numerous City witnesses to lie under oath to hide the three decades of criminal activity and ongoing illegal cover-up. I learned that as I reported the crimes to DA Reed her office was sending my information over to the City. Corrupt City Attorney Bernard and his staff took every crime and fabricated a CYA story to justify or hide the illegal act. The whistleblower trial was a series of soap opera/novella performances by City employees involved in the fraud/cover-up orchestrated for the court by corrupt city attorney Deborah Klein. CIO Richard Varn told the critical lies and others followed in his footsteps. Super Lawyer Malinda Gaul sat by and allowed the fraud to continue, and refused to call for a new/fair trial. Gaul, Klein, Kosanovich, City Attorney Bernard, Judge Antonia Arteaga, Police Chief William McManus, aggravated perjury
 
 
My appeal was denied as Super lawyer Malinda Gaul purposefully refused to preserve the error and never objected to anything. If there was no objection than the appeals court cannot even look at anything. We filed the appeal to preserve our right to ask for a review once the corruption is exposed and the lying within our local government and law enforcement community is halted.
 
DA Reed, etc. have proof of the fraud and ongoing criminal cover-up but refuse to reply to calls, letters, etc. They stall in an effort to allow the statute of limitations to expire as in the case of Watergate – the illegal cover-up has snared too many top level crooks. They must keepm the crimes/cover-up secret.
 
 
In June I filed police reports with SAPD and BCSO and delivered documents to City Hall proving the crimes and cover-up. My wife and I delivered the documents and set up meetings with Councilpersons with no problem, 2009 two SAPD officers came to my home and served me with a criminal trespass warning baring entry into City Hall and Council Meetings. Chief McManus and City Attorney Bernard signed the illegal/unconstitutional ban BUT will provide no reason, time limit, due process hearing, etc. Bernard has lied and stalled any effort by Attorney Edward Pina to get the ban lifted. He can't afford to have the crimes, the cover-up, his role in the criminal conspiracy
 
On the night of July 4, threatened no one, etc. he apologized and said that he was embarrassed. He published a factual report on July 5, 2011 stating that there was evidence of no mental problems and that the allegations I discussed with him were backed up with documentation and that I was credible. SAPD has this report - SAPD 11167835/SAPD-2011-0702097 – on file since July 5 BUT still refuses to acknowledge the fraud/theft and cover-up. We believe that the City was attempting to fabricate some justification for the 25 month illegal ban making ALL Council meetings since July 1, 2009 illegal and ALL city business voidable. Officer Bandoske refused to participate in the criminal cover-up and told the truth - a first for the SAPD !
 
SAPD and the City ignore letters asking why Mental Health Division officers are available to harass law-abiding citizens who report public/police corruption BUT couldn’t assist mentally ill citizen Pierre Abernathy who recently died at the hands of the SAPD on August 4
 
 
Editor Elaine Wolff with the SA Current wrote a few very informative articles BUT when she left any support from the Current evaporated.
 
The Express News refuses to cover the story
 
KSAT and WOAI refuse to cover the story and sometimes censor comments.
 
The public/police corruption should have been exposed six years ago. The criminals inside the City should have been terminated and prosecuted. Efforts should have been made to locate and recover our money.
 
Instead, theft, cover-up continues. The list of criminal conspirators grows.

However

The guys featured in the operation video are shown putting up a bunch of stickers. That will appeal to a certain demographic, but we only need to convince more to vote against him than for him.  

I think as a first step

Is anyone with me or am I alone in my desire to vote out Lamar Smith?

Does anyone have any ideas as to what we should coordinate?

EDIT: As one of the few democrats who live in his district, the best chance we have is to vote for a different Republican in the primary.

Truthfully, we raise awareness and maybe shame him.

1370566528.0,1ftxz1,The girl with the Billy Bob's Beds post wants one more word. Please take the time to read.,UsefulPlatypus,93,25,27,"I posted the story of Billy Bob confronting my father about his service dog in the store. Most of you took the story how it was meant to be perceived. Most of you understand the wrong doing in that situation. 

But to be honest, NEED a service dog. It's not your fault you haven't had the reason to know a service dog personally and that's a lucky thing. 

Part of me thinks this is none of your fucking business, whatever, and it makes me sad for him. I would like to know that, as his daughter, I tried to help at least some of you understand his situation and others like him. I would really appreciate it if you would read what I have written for you, and I welcome any further questions.

My father broke his neck in 2006. His spinal cord is permanently damaged at his C5 vertebrae making him what they call a ""super quad"". The link below will give you an idea of what his body is capable of. It's not much. He is put in a motorized wheelchair every morning but since he cannot keep himself sitting up, he still probably wouldn't be able to reach it.

His hands remain open and flat. Try to carry out your everyday activities with flat hands and not drop one thing. It is not possible and it sucks.

All of that being said, with his ramp still up (which has happened probably more times than he's admitted to, he would have to wait for someone to walk close enough to his van and hope to get their attention. We all know it gets pretty fucking hot in parking lots around this time of the year....and all the other times too I guess.

Quadriplegics cannot regulate their own body temperature and if they get too hot or too cold

This dog is necessary. We are not abusing the system, we get harassed everyday. I do not blame you for being ignorant on an issue you have not been a part of personally. But please, learn something from this.

Not all service dogs are large breeds. If my dad's dog was a large breed

Not all small dogs are ""comfort dogs"". This schnauzer went to school for almost a year and works his fucking ass off.

That dog IS the reason my dad doesn't need a nurses aid with him at all times. He is the reason my dad has what little independence is left in his life.

The restaurant was extremely hot inside, there were loads of people in flip flops and t-shirts. It took at least 10 minutes for the waiter to get us much-needed water, and by the time we got our cocktails I had already proposed and we had figured out our entrees. 

Fortunately a family was sitting next to us and were kind enough to take our picture right after I proposed to her and she said yes. 

[Right after she said yes! ](http://i.imgur.com/f5vcq11)


The place was so dark, and the table next to us walked. When the waiter finally after another 20 minutes came by with our appetizer and got the WRONG ORDER, my fiance was so upset she insisted we complained to the manager, got comped and left. At least the manager was kind enough to let us walk for free. 

We went to our favorite restaurant, and Charter House is not that place. Extremely disappointed, do not go, but at least I got a fiance out of the deal!

**Places I Know Exist and have been to.**

1.  The Ghost Tracks

Located near the intersection of [Villamain and Shane Road](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=&amp;daddr=29.317227,0.01929&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=ddw1&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all).  Legend has it that a bus got stuck on these train tracks and all of the kids died as a train hit the bus.  The streets in the neighborhood near the tracks has street names that are named after the kids that died.  If you park your car on the edge of the tracks, put it in neutral and even turn the car off, the ghosts of the kids will push you across the tracks to keep you safe.  It's kind of creepy because the tracks actually rise up and your car is pushed up hill and over the tracks.

2.  Ed Clark's Place (Crazy Christmas Guy)

Located at [14106 Short Horn Street](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=14106+Short+Horn+Street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=29.569837,-98.385158&amp;sspn=0.00064,0.001206&amp;hnear=14106+Short+Horn+St,+San+Antonio,+Bexar,+Texas+78247&amp;t=m&amp;z=16).  From what I understand, Ed Clark's wife died and she loved Christmas.  In her memory, like HEB and stuff, so that may not be true.  (you can get a good look with google street view)

3.  Peacock Subdivision

I went here back in the 90's, I have been looking for this place for years)  Anyway, there is a subdivision that is literally crawling with real peacocks that the residents feed and keep around.  The story that I heard is that there used to be a small ranch across from the subdivision but the owner died, leaving the peacocks to fend for themselves.  They eventually left the ranch and took up roost in the neighborhood.  I did not know this, but peacocks are freaking loud and they actually roost in trees.  I really thought that they were just lawn decorations until I saw one jump into a tree.

**Places that I have heard of

1.  Toy Tree Lady

Rumor has it that there is some crazy lady

2.  TRO Bridge

Located [here](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.976735,0.617294&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=0x865bf34b316176c7:0xb90eb2db6d69febf,29.976735,-98.845995&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=11).  It is well outside of San Antonio, but it sounds pretty scary and cool enough to be included.  Supposedly if you walk across the bridge and look down, you feel hands grabbing at your ankles.  Creepy!

* **Reason for Take In:**  Routine Oil Change 

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 201009

* **Details of Take In:** Took a vehicle in for an oil change. Was informed car barely had any oil due to a MAJOR oil leak that needed attention ASAP or the engine would go out (at this time was told it was leaking at oil pan gasket and valve cover gasket).  *This is the ONLY issue with my car notated at this point.*

* **Result:** Paid for parts upfront to ensure I would be back to get work completed.


3rd Visit:
* **Date:** 12/13/2012

* **Reason for Take In:** To Complete work to fix leak at oil pan gasket and valve cover gasket

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 202000  (&lt;---This Mileage recorded at 202000 would indicate that I had driven almost 1000 miles within two days---a Tues-Thurs

* **Details of Take In:**  Take car in

* **Result:** Mention now of air intake hose needs replacement. *(No mention of this notated the two previous times vehicle was in shop)*



4th Visit:
* **Date:** 12/26/2012

* **Reason for Take In:**Car is leaking considerate amounts of oil onto driveway and street

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 201963 (&lt;---This Mileage recorded at 201963 now shows that I lost 37 miles from the last Mileage recorded?  This concerns me when they are offering a warranty.)

* **Details of Take In:** Was informed correcting initial problem caused more pressure throughout the engine and because of that, by replacing those gaskets, it created more oil pressure and caused another two gaskets to blow (including Rear Main Seal). The original estimate given to me for the second job was well over $600 dollars.  One of the managers named DANIEL (Argenal) suggested I replaced my oil pump because it wasn't working.  When I had him repeat the exact same things to my husband (as I knew I couldn't repeat all of it word for word), and my husband inquired as to if the oil pump was working, Daniel changed his story and then said to him, ""Well it works, but it's not as smooth as it should be."" (ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?!)  He JUST told me it wasn't working, and just get it out of there (because at this point

* **Result:** Paid additional $440.03 to repair newly blown gaskets (including Rear Main Seal gasket)


5th Visit:
* **Date:** 01/04/2013

* **Reason for Take In:** Car is now leaking massive amounts of oil onto driveway and street. Except this time

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 201963 (&lt;---This Mileage recorded at 201963 AGAIN

* **Details of Take In:**  I take it back, I just want the problem FIXED.  After not receiving a call the next day after they'd been open for 5 hours, I finally call them to inquire about the status of it, only to be asked by Matt, **""Did you add more oil to the car?""**  ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?!  NO!!!! THE ONLY PEOPLE TO REMOTELY TOUCH MY CAR AND IT'S ENGINE PARTS WERE YOU GUYS!!!  So he explains there was an extra quart of oil in the car and that's what was causing the re-leak.  **How the heck do I know those ""mechanics"" there didn't put in an extra ½ quart the FIRST time and that's what caused the other gaskets to fail/blow?!**   

* **Result:** Was told that correct amount of oil was replaced and no other issues were found at that time.  


6th Visit: 
* **Date:** 01/05/2013

* **Reason for Take In:**  Went in because car was now smoking and makes whistling sound while driving or in idle. 

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 202198  

* **Details of Take In:** When I picked up the vehicle the day before, caused the leak (this is the first time I am learning that any repair work was done to my car the day before other than the replacement of the correct amount of oil---If this is the case why wasn’t my correct mileage updated to reset the warranty?).
  
* **Result:**  Cleaned the bottom of the car thoroughly to stop the smoking.  Was informed whistling sound came from Air Intake Hose that needed replacement (although it needed replacement prior to this




At this time, WHY/WHAT was the cause of the leak, and he repeated that it was a faulty Valve Cover Gasket.  **When I asked him why this was the first time I was hearing about the faulty replacement he goes, (and I quote), “Oh, that’s my bad mam, I should’ve told you about that.”  When I just stared at him in disbelief, “But I’ve been really, how do I know YOU didn’t go and add more oil to it?”  Appalled, he went out to my car




After I left, Marc Lascano, who initially tries to get me to go back to the store to check out the vehicle yet again.  I inform him I do not trust those mechanics, but agree to let him attempt to fix whatever the problem might be. I agree to drop off my car at another location further away and offer to leave it yet again overnight.  Mr. Lascano, called me later the next day after I dropped my vehicle off, to inform me that there was indeed still a leak and it was coming from the Oil Pan Gasket and the same Valve Cover gasket that had been “replaced” by them before.  **He admitted that “it was a botched job” by his mechanics and would be replacing/redoing those items personally himself.**  He then said that a Rear Main Seal may be leaking but he wasn’t 100% sure (the Rear Main Seal was supposed to have been replaced the SECOND time, but according to Mr. Lascano, about how the heck do I know if his mechanics at the initial location didn't put in an extra ½ quart the FIRST time and that's what caused the other gaskets to fail/blow


7th Visit: 

* **Date:** 01/10/2013

* **Reason for Take In:** Car STILL leaking (took into another location other than initial location)

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 202302

* **Details of Take In:** Took in AGAIN to get same initial problem corrected. 

* **Result:** Replaced BOTH valve cover gasket and oil pan gasket.  



The District Manager, I dealt with the manager at that location named Louis Yarborough, a very nice gentleman.  Interestingly enough, Mr. Yarborough informed me that the day before after seeing the work done on my car, Mr. Lascano called a mandatory surprise safety meeting, in which he showcased my car and the work that was done to it, saying the work done was a big “NO-NO” for the company.



Personal Statement:  I don’t believe there was ever a need for the second job (at a cost of $440.03).  I honestly feel, upon inspection of my vehicle, could not confirm any work had been done, but could confirm that there was a possible Rear Main Seal leak (which was supposed to have been one of the newly replaced gaskets the second time around).  

If I was trying to screw this company over the way they did me, as I do not believe there was any other problem with the vehicle other than the initial problem (as stated by their own District Manager), however, I am not having much luck in getting that back.  In addition, I don’t even think the second time around job was completed considering the fact that the District Manager could NOT confirm any work had been done, but could confirm a possible leak at the Rear Main Seal.  


If anyone has any comments/concerns/questions

Thank you

I had to drive my good friend across town (from Wurzbach/I10 to 410/35) after the game so she could pay her ransom and release her car.

So, instead of within the lots themselves.  ASK YOUR FRIENDS where they parked when they show up.  I feel slightly guilty for not thinking of this last night :(  It'll save everyone a lot of time, money, and frustration.

My daughter has a crappy fleece blanket that she earned with her H-E-Buddy Bucks. We have been working on getting her to show affection and attachment

Like the overwhelmed idiot parents that my husband and I are

We would just go ""buy"" another one but this prize cycle ends at the end of this month and we only have about 250 of the 500 points needed. 

We would be ecstatic if anyone could hook us up with a new one really

The closest H-E-Bs are in Kerrville and NW San Antonio but we can drive a little further than that. The blanket is blue and pictures a personified grocery bag in winter attire. 

**TL;DR-** Stupid parents lose kid's comfort object- blue fleece H-E-Buddy blanket. Mom begs for replacement in Kerrville or north San Antonio. 

**Edit-** Thanks a million for the offers, right? It's Christmas Eve and the nearest one is ~35 miles away, so I hope they have one there and don't mind! I'll update when we get home. We may have to take some one up on one of these offers. 

**Update-** We drove over 30 minutes to the nearest store and I explained the situation to the busy middle-aged lady at the service desk. She looked down at my 240 out of 500 points, up... She then gave a sigh of reluctantcy, threw our points away (I'm tense at this point), and from under the counter dug out a new folded blanket in crisp plastic wrapping. Through her tough act I saw her eyes misting. I cried and told her I was happy, she cracked a smile, I got out of her space ASAP. 

The kid was sleeping in the car so I draped it over her lap. You shoulda seen dem eyes light up when she found it. 

Thanks again for all of the offers as well as giving me the balls (ovaries?) to just ask the store politely for a new one. Lesson learned and mission accomplished.  

**Second TL;DR-** Begged and traded less than half of the points required for a new blanket. Teared up like a wimp. Kid was happy. Thanks. ",self,t5_2qqch,1356383483.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/15ctfx/anyone_work_at_heb_my_family_needs_a_favor_xpost/

This issue is bigger than ""does Walmart have the right""? It is really a quality of life issue that affects us all

 
Walmart is not a convenience store and does not need to be right in the middle of any residential area

 
Folks, I have heard it from a multitude of people at the local level and from many business executives considering San Antonio for possible corporate relocations. When I am looking at aerial photographs it is very apparent that we are trading green space for ugly concrete and asphalt. Our ""inferiority complex"" is evident as you drive the City and see the ill conceived and badly located commercial projects that are encroaching on the residential neighborhoods, projects that the City and it's people should not have approved. To think that we would approve of a Walmart at this location, right next to a beautifully done park, a real ""sanctuary"" for a lot of people, is beyond my comprehension. Most quality, major metropolitan areas would not allow this to happen and for sure it will reflect poorly on San Antonio. 

 
Walmart says ""it will create jobs"". I contend that if we keep allowing the ugliness created by unbridled development to go on, than Walmart can ever hope to create. On many occasions, at the end of a tour of SA, when I've asked corporate executives considering relocation for their honest opinion of what they think of San Antonio, their response has been ""well, it's nice but outside of the River Walk, it sure is ugly"". As a side note, they comment on the amount of trash on the streets as well. Walmart, put our foot down and take a stand if we hope to become known as a ""quality city"". 

 
Let's not confuse ""business friendly"" with ""sure

Case against assistant DA's son dismissed
By Brian Chasnoff

June 2

Shortly after midnight

Behind the wheel was Truman Biggs


At first

He told the officers he hadn't been drinking, found a fake ID in his wallet and saw an open, half-emptied beer can on the front passenger floorboard.

After struggling through a field sobriety test

He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated.

From there

Eight months later

That prosecutor was not Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed or anyone in her office. Sensitive to the conflict of interest

That same day, Bunk filed a motion to dismiss the case, scrawling “interest of justice” as the reason, and Christian signed it.

In Bexar County, mandating blood draws for anyone who refuses a Breathalyzer test. And it's virtually impossible to get a charge dismissed if a suspect blows above a 0.15 — particularly when witnesses are available and no motion to suppress evidence is filed.

First Assistant District Attorney Cliff Herberg acknowledged this reality.

“I think that's accurate

In Truman's case, never filed any motion to suppress.

So I called Bunk last week to ask why, exactly, was the “interest of justice.”

Bunk

“I'm really not at liberty to talk about any of my investigation that I did on that

Christian, he said, is the prerogative of the prosecutor.

“It's not my interest to question why the special prosecutor is dismissing stuff

When I told him Bunk wouldn't discuss his rationale

For her part

“I have absolutely no knowledge of it

Biggs “is my chief and I work closely with her, 'I'm not going to handle this.' I haven't even spoken to her about it. I haven't spoken to Charles Bunk probably — I don't even know when the last time I saw Charles was — oh, ages ago. It's been a long time.”

Bunk began working as a Bexar County prosecutor in the mid-'90s

Reed said Bunk should've filed the complaint against Truman.

“That would've been his responsibility

I asked Biggs if she thought her position had enabled her son to skip the charge.

“I'm not going to comment on that

“I did not talk to Bunk once about this

On Friday

“This is a video that does not comport with the breath test

Asked to step out of the SUV

At one point

“So

“I'll be honest

“What would you do?”

“I would have him call somebody to come pick him up and take him home because I can smell alcohol on him.”

“I'll tell you what I'm going to do

Kuntz cited this exchange as a reason the case was not “makeable” for a prosecutor. Yet, and the other officer was far more experienced. Had the court summoned the officers as witnesses, a jury could have considered this interplay.

Instead

Another case in which Reed recused herself came to a similar conclusion.

In 2008, when airport screeners reported finding a gun in Mueller's backpack. Mueller was arrested and charged with a felony.

But within hours of his arrest

Reed later turned the case over to a special prosecutor, calling it a “reckless act” by someone with no previous criminal record.

On Friday

“Stand up and say why you're doing it

“To dismiss a charge 'in the interest of justice

 Read the motion to dismiss the DWI charge

 Read Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed's motion to appoint a special prosecutor

 Read Judge Wayne Christian's order appointing a special prosecutor

The murderer is still not behind bars. In fact, I don't know when it will be but I wanted to find out if people would be interested in supporting us (call it a hand count). I will of course let you guys know when the candle light vigil will be held. I just wanted to know if I can count on you when the time comes. Please let me know how many San Antonians would be willing to spare some time to make people aware of hoe long a hate crime can go unpunished. (Unfortunately I will not be able to provide all the candles) Also, if anyone has any other ideas on how we can make people more aware of the slow justice system, I am all ears. Thank you.

I have had a long history with small scale agricultural projects

We will use underutilized land and pay the landowner up front for the use of his land. This way, so we obviously want happy animals.

My mission is to create a web platform that connects farmers, but for farmers and ranchers. Our goal is to provide ‘Whole Food's' quality meat at an HEB price. By avoiding distributors and retailers, we can eliminate the middleman and save a lot of money. This project is the first step towards fulfilling that goal.

All Natural, Antibiotic and Hormone Free Beef

 The price is $200 for a 10% share. That is roughly 40 lbs of meat. The meat will be ready around November 2013. I will begin collecting money this week. Payment can be made via cash

For sanitary reasons we will be using a professional butcher to slaughter, but I estimate it will be roughly $50 /share for butchering and packaging costs. The butchering cost will be due when you take delivery of the meat. 

The steer will be butchered at around 1000-1200lbs, however, I do welcome any suggestions on how to divide the meat equitably.  

We will purchase a steer and keep him to 1000-1200lbs in weight, but again, it will be around Nov.
The ranchers who will be raising the animal will be helping me source a quality animal. 

The steer will be grass fed only
When the meat is ready

Some of you may have heard that Rep. Lamar Smith (TX-21) is being challenged in the GOP Primary by Sheriff Richard Mack. Lamar Smith is the big sponsor behind SOPA and other bills that are going to be used to regulation and possibly tax the internet. One of the things I will mention is from the currents maps proposed

- Our uniqueness. SA doesn't try to be anything/anyone else.  We're a proudly unique city.

- Our multicultural city...a place that (after living all over the place in my military days) is the least racially divided city.  Everyone is welcome in SA.

- Our incredible history that goes well beyond the Alamo.  Missions anyone?

- Our amazing food.  Sure

- The fact that many of us here are bilingual to at least some degree.  Uncommon...and very cool.

I'd like to ask you...what is it that makes SA special for you?

A description from EarthSky.com:

The Perseid meteor shower is perhaps the most beloved meteor shower of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. The shower builds gradually to a peak, for us in the Northern Hemisphere, this shower comes when the weather is warm. The Perseids tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into midnight, and typically produce the most meteors in the wee hours before dawn. They radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus the Hero, but, as with all meteor shower radiant points, you don’t need to know Perseus to watch the shower; instead, you can look for the Perseids around August 10-13. They combine with the Delta Aquarid shower (above) to produce the year’s most dazzling display of shooting stars. In 2013, 12 and 13.

Dough Pizzeria - As we were walking up to the restaurant, which I hadn't been expecting. We sat at a table outside and shared a bottle of wine and some appetizers while we waited.

We were finally shown to our table and our server asked if we had ever been there before, like using tomatoes from the San Marzano valley region.

The wait at the pizzeria meant I had to cancel my reservations for the Ghost Tour

Ocho Lounge - In the basement of the Havana Hotel. This place was exactly as described. Creepy, quiet, fairly swanky bar with two very friendly bartenders. There was also a staircase that led back up to a seating area by the river with large chandeliers and generally a fantastic atmosphere. We enjoyed this bar very much and I definitely recommend it for dates.

Saturday we hit the Farmers Market, some goat cheese, and head to Brackenridge park and sat, ate, and read on our kindles. ;)

Saturday day we watched movies on netflix, she loves Pool, this place had both. It was already busy and only got busier. The clientele that night was primarily black, which I really enjoyed, being from the very white Austin. Now, I'm white, and so is my date, so when I saw my audience would be mostly young

We had plenty of drinks and after 2 hours or so (it was very busy) I got to get up and sing James Brown - It's A Man's World. The people I had met that night and had been chatting/dancing with lost their shit when this little white kid got up and belted out some James Brown.

Sunday we slept in til 11, for some reason, quiche. I love to cook so we went to the grocery store, picked up supplies, and I made a quiche for her from scratch, crust and all. More TV watching and reading followed, then for dinner I cooked her my well practiced steak in a cast iron skillet, and roasted asparagus.

I left Sunday night

**EDIT 2:** Our dog is safely home after a long day. The mom and daughter that found her were awesome folks and help get stray dogs off the street so they can find the owners with no expectation of a reward whatsoever. They find her wandering near Rittiman along the highway where all those 18 wheelers are--it's scary to imagine what could've happened to her if they didn't take the time to get her. They said she was very timid and frightened. They found her with a makeshift rope noose around her next, but it feels like it's been forever! F

We live in a place that produces what is arguably the best beef in the world. We should have the best of it on our tables. 
We raise the hogs ourselves in Lockhart, who have been raising beef since 1908. 

I explained my goal of finding better uses for under-utilized land and creating humanely raised yet affordable grass fed beef, no corn or anything GMO, no antibiotics, and a diet of fresh grass and hay.

Animals should not be confined in feedlots and fed corn. Pasture raised grassfed steer

A 1

We are selling 10% shares of the animal which should give you around 40lbs of meat. A 10% share is $200.

All Natural, Antibiotic and Hormone Free Beef

 The price is $200 for a 10% share. That is roughly 40 lbs of meat. The meat will be ready around Oct. 2013. I will begin collecting money this week so that we can pay the landowners next week and get the ball rolling quickly. Payment can be made via cash

For sanitary reasons we will be using a professional butcher to slaughter, but I estimate it will be roughly $50 /share for butchering and packaging costs. The butchering cost will be due when you take delivery of the meat. 

The steer will be butchered at around 1000-1200lbs, however, I do welcome any suggestions on how to divide the meat equitably.  

We will purchase a steer and keep him to 1000-1200lbs in weight, but again, it will be around September.

Pigs have large litters, sick, or already large enough for slaughter. It makes sense; anyone who is selling cattle before they are ready for slaughter will sell you the worst animals of his herd. He will keep the best on his ranch. Because of the difficulty in finding the right animal, I can’t tell you what breed will be bought at this time. I really have my heart set on either Angus or Hereford. (The best beef I ever had was from a grass fed Argentine Hereford.) I can guarantee that it will be a great animal with premium/heritage genetics. The ranchers who will be raising the animal will be helping me source a quality animal. 

The steer will be grass fed only

When the meat is ready

All Natural Hormone Free Pork 

Officer Dan is the hog currently living on my land in Lockhart. This heritage breed from the UK is a Berkshire, stale bread, fruit, and spent grains from homebrewers. He also eats GMO-free corn and hog feed. I used to let him run wild and eat grass, but now he is too big. Chasing after a hog gone wild is surprisingly fun, but not something you want to do more than once.  He lives in a pen now, but has plenty of room and is able to root in the ground


Each share is 20% and costs $150. A share gets you roughly 28 lbs of meat. There will be lots of lard for the taking if anyone wants it. The hog will be ready to eat in around five months. If you want me to make bacon for you please let me know

There will be a butchering fee due upon delivery of the meat. It is around $0.50/lb. Again

Please email me at Tacosauruscoopfarm@gmail.com so I have your contact info. I will send out an email on Saturday with all the details. 

 made a Facebook page to keep everyone posted as the project progresses.

So we decided

The two things that are stopping us are a place to host the tournament (Where we can bring in a good number of awesome gamers and they can all relax and enjoy themselves without it being too crowded) and planning the budget in a way where we don't go broke and we can still award our winners and provide snacks and such for the participants (And if I'm being honest here

The budget is still being worked out though and it's getting better and if you have any ideas on that feel free to leave them

Also, ways to keep everyone entertained (especially if these tournaments take a few hours), or any other ways to make the whole experience better.

We'll come back to this periodically, We really want to hear what you think.

I am writing this on the behalf of a young man from San Antonio
  
This young man may or may not have a learning disability, and puts everything into his time on the job. He is married, and his $200 a week paycheck goes entirely to the $200 a week cost of living at a Homewood Inn in San Antonio. I will try to clear this up, but I do believe his wife has a job as well, but it provides only enough to enable them to eat. A hamburger is treated like a steak at Ruth's Chris.  
  
About a week ago, so he and his wife spent every dime they had to take a bus to check on her. His mom has also been taking care of her eldest son's (who is apparently not the greatest father in the world) two daughters, so the young man I'm writing about knew that his presence would be beneficial.  
  
Unfortunately, so the young man and his bride could not stay there after she passed away. With his two nieces and his wife to take care of, in the midst of grieving the loss of his mother, he had nowhere to turn. They have been living in a wooded area with no shelter for a few days now. That's right: No car, no tent, no food, no money.  
  
He called my little brother and told him the situation, so I don't know what limits he might face. He asked my little brother for a job reference and of course, my brother obliged wholeheartedly. But this young man might not understand that it's near impossible to get a job without an address.  
  
This is tearing at our heartstrings. Neither of us have the financial resources to help him, I've helped Lucas, I've helped Karen the bus driver in New York, and cried along with each of you at many other posts that showed how fragile life can be.  
  
I am asking you for your advice on how to help this kid. I am considering cross-posting this to /r/Assistance
  
Thank you in advance. If I am leaving out pertinent information

1) What's there to do around there? Museums, etc. What does the entertainment scene look like? Night life? How about the music scene? (And saying that Austin has an awesome music scene and is only an hour away is cheating!)

2) How bicycle friendly is the city? I picked up bicycling as a hobby in the past year, but bike trails and parks I can go to are essential. I hear the hill country outside the city is great for outdoorsy stuff, too, so feel free to mention your favorite sights/camping spots/whatever.

3) Where should I live? I looked into some older posts, and would be looking to spend $700 (give or take about $200) per month on a one bedroom apartment.

Please

They're poised to stifle all forms of artistic expression and free speech simply because it conflicts with their personal beliefs. The basis for their hatred is is due to the fact that the play [Corpus Christi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_%28play%29) in which Jesus is depicted as gay recently showed at [The San Pedro Playhouse](http://qsanantonio.com/corpuschristi.html). 

They have every right under the constitution to protest

Any advice on how best to confront and stop their plot would be much appreciated.

So I used to work over at Sea World of San Antonio as the ride operator of the Great White. I would either be on the platform, today was an exceptionally crazy Saturday, meaning we had a full queue of people waiting to board. I remember that day clearly.

There were 4 guys on platform, watching through the window and making sure everything was good and dandy. The 4 guys on platform were dicking around, but nothing too bad, just enjoying themselves as much as someone working at a god forsaken place like Sea World could.

I look through my monitor to check everything (I can only see a few back rows with this monitor) and I see everything is fine. The 4 dudes get on their pressurized pads, any one of the guys on platform could have walked off the pad and stopped the train from leaving the station).

So, and launch the train. As the train is going by, with the mindless idiots still with their freaking thumbs up and on the pressurized pads, I watch as some lady still has her harness up ([picture of the seats and harness](http://woofcubs.com/BDO-990501/BDO12-990501.jpg)), and hanging on to the seat of the ride. [This is what she saw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvpXdGNZeY4) (Best Video I could find. This is the front seat though and she only went up a few feet.)

So I see her

**back story here** Our boss that morning had a meeting with us, pretty much we hit it, we get fired. 

So I'm seeing this poor lady, run out of the control room and drag the step rail a good 10 feet up, helping the poor lady from the inclined seat (you should note that my co-workers were staring stupidly, I guess cause of shock). As I'm coming back down the stairs with the lady, my boss has his eyes on me as he motions to me. ""Go home,"" were his only words. 

Gladly

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Texas during the late fall/early winter and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration

Here’s what I propose.  Those of us who can do something around 7 or 8pm on November 22nd should all find a relatively inexpensive restaurant (I’m thinking Cracker Barrel – they have good Thanksgiving type comfort food) and have Thanksgiving dinner together.  Maybe we could hit up a bar afterwards.  Any ideas for restaurants or bars?

Bring your own liquor

I have a fucked up pool table with no felt for a table for inside but not much outside. There is no sound system that I know if so if someone wants to bring something

There is maybe 35-40 yards of weeds I can mow in the back if people want to play frisbee or something. I was also thinking beer pong/beirut if people still play that.

Not sure when to start

Thoughts?

The best things I discovered were the Menger Hotel

I'm a huge Teddy Roosevelt fan. The history in the area was a pleasure to see
Interesting there's a room dedicated to Roy Rogers there too.  The hotel itself reminds me of the lafayette hotel here in Buffalo

We weren't able to get to the spots that were suggested for live music
The cove's food was good. While it seemed a little overpriced

The less traveled parts of the riverwalk are quaint

the alamo is pretty cool to photograph at night. is much of it rebuilt? we were wondering about that....

wish i more time to wander and discover more hidden spots off the beaten path of the city.  
cheers.
