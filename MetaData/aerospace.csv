I am a complex individual

I am a 26-year-old male software engineer. I received my BS in Computer Engineering in 2010

I am a good engineer and I would like to work on more challenging projects. For me

The people who have worked with me express a great deal of appreciation not only for my commitment to well-designed, but also my abilities as a communicator and synthesizer - ""team skills"" that can sometimes be shortfalls for specialists and engineers.

The companies I am most interested in working for, Blue Origin, appear to have frankly awful work/life balance. In fact, I have all but written these companies off at this point. It would be great to be that kind of engineer, but I know myself better than that. I am a complex person and I need time for arts, exercise, socializing, or I will probably fall into depression. It is my personal philosophy that there is no point doing something

However those companies are the ones doing the things I want to do, the large contractors also do a great deal of defense work, which I want to avoid.

Are these general assumptions correct or am I completely misguided here?

Are there other options out there I am not thinking of? For example

Where do you think I might fit in best?

Does anyone have any suggestions for things I should think about? Please don't be afraid to speak up if you think I won't like what you have to say. Honest opinions from people with first-hand knowledge is the most valuable thing anyone can give me right now. Life involves a lot of tough decisions and sacrifice and I am prepared for that. But it never hurts to have the best information one can get before making those tough choices!

Thanks in advance for any and all help!


**EDIT**: Many people are pointing out that only having web dev experience and Ruby proficiency is not going to serve me very well. Let me address this. First off

- C++ (I am in the beginning stages of my first small C++ project)

- Embedded Systems (I intend to purchase an Arduino and possibly one of those small hacker's quadcopters.)

- Robotics (I am currently enrolled in a control theory course on Coursera.)

In addition, and developing my instinct for correct encapsulation and separation of concerns. In an interview where theory questions are asked, I believe I would do okay.

3. How does a company like Boeing or Airbus choose to source an engine with a particular company? I know that may be a long or, in the case of engines, do they choose two companies and not three?

Hello [/r/aerospace](/r/aerospace) folks! This is going to be largely a self-plug, and I wish you all the best whatever happens. I can't wait for the day when we can all go to LEO and beyond.




So

Needless to say, but I need your votes to win!

You may ask, **I hope to go up there with a HD-video camera and capture some footage from orbit, and then bring it down for all to see on YouTube!This footage, I believe, should contain a slip of paper with a picture of the reddit alien, floating serenely in microgravity. Never mind putting Reddit on the map, we'll put it into space!**


The regional competition closes on 25.3.2012, they get presented to a committee that makes the decision who gets selected for the final competition. That part is all up to me, and I will do my utmost to be charismatic and win that for us.


I'll also be taking any suggestions you might have that could be realistically be realized within the constraints of a commercial spaceflight company; I'm not certain about the video, and share this with your friends!**


With as much personal humility as I can muster while asking for such a big opportunity, but the vote button is the yellow Äänestä button, and of course you recognize the facebook thumbs up.


Below is the short blurp I wrote for the page
Private Space industry provides us something we've never had: A democratic access to the stars, and though I cannot offer that to you, we can bring that future into fruition. The winner of this competition goes to the stars in our stead, until such a day when we can all do the same. If you choose me to be that representative, I will to the best of my ability try to bring back HD-video for all to see, and I will share as much as I can about what I saw and felt, until such a day until you can experience the same. I have from an early age tried to understand the world and its incredible beauty in any way possible, but absurdly enough I am too tall to ever be an astronaut.

&gt;* If I want to watch a launch in the Continental U.S.
&gt;* The launch platforms I have to choose from are: [Minotaur I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur_%28rocket%29), ~~Delta II~~, [Delta IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV), and ~~the Space Shuttle~~.

NASA provides [instructions on good public viewing positions](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/viewing.html), I'd love a view like [this one](http://www.launchphotography.com/GLAST_2.jpg) if possible.) Who do I schmooze in order to get the best seats in the house? (I'm guessing that the CEO of *SatelliteMegaCorp* isn't watching the launch with binoculars from his pickup bed on the state highway...) Could choosing a poorly-attended launch help my chances of getting closer? Do different launch providers have different policies on this?

I would have switched majors, life. I looked into internships

I graduated with a GPA of 2.04, working for a paltry $11/hr doing retail completely unrelated aerospace, for over two years now. I've been looking, and networking, even spending the little I can afford to go to aerospace conferences to network, and hopefully try to find someone within the industry who will give me a chance. 

I've known since the beginning of my sophomore year that my grades weren't going to be my strong point and spent the rest of my college life doing everything I could to make up for that. For four years I was on a team that worked to develop a rocket entirely under sparse sponsorship funding with the end goal of making it past the Kármán line, made significant advances in total integration, and redesigned entire systems, all as a part of an extra curricular activity. I was even the team leader of my senior design project. I stand behind the fact that even in comparison to my peers who had far better GPA's than me, I have hands on experience that was invaluable to my understanding of aerospace and its application far above what they learned in school.

So here is what is going on for me, I ordered 10 grams of synthetic cannabis online wanting to try it as I had been abstaining from any substance due to drug testing in the industry. I had smoked natural cannabis while I was in school, mostly on weekends, and some nights after class as a way to relieve stress and anxiety from all the pressure.

A short synopsis of what happened next:
The Department of Homeland security intercepted my shipment in December (before the substance I ordered was actually illegal), but I had 5-6 police officers pointing loaded weapons at my head with 3 of them screaming conflicting instructions at me. I'm lucky as hell to be alive.

After several months of legal battles with a privately hired lawyer (I would have been *completely* screwed with a public defender)

The way things stand now, they made synthetic cannabis a felony as apposed to a misdemeanor (it took months of negotiation to even avoid 3 months of jail). For a while, I faced a 1-3 year sentence.

Regardless, thereby causing me anxiety-attack inducing stress. I need to be able to afford to live on my own, and soon.



Right now, It's a sealed record, but before it's sealed, the company can save your record in a database and forever prevent you from doing what you love.


So






A Place in my hometown is extremely interested in hiring me, this company is entirely unrelated to aerospace, and I'm not sure how I would ever get back to aircraft/spacecraft design after the 3-5 years I would owe them. The starting pay is ~40k and currently that is 2-3 times what I make with my hourly salary over a year. It would be enough I could at least move out of my fathers house and start a life of my own.

My major conflict however, but my worry is that if I tell him everything that has happened, it will ruin it. At the same time, however, if I tell him, he could be the person who gives me the chance I need.

What I am worried about

So

What should I do?

Tl;Dr: Please just read it, but it's the only way to understand the choice I'm looking for input on.

I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light as to why this is.  My experiment was performed at a Re of 100, the Cd should decrease as Re increases. My Cd values turn out to be smaller than the NACA values due to the shift, so I don't think this is the reason.

Strange question but I have never seen it posed elsewhere.

I am currently a 2nd yr Analyst at a Bank in Manhattan in an Operations group. I graduated 3 years ago from a Finance Target University that is in the top 20 Undergrad Business Schools. 
For various reasons

One of the many problems I am having is obviously a complete lack of relevant work experience. 
Basically my question is - Is there any reasonable way to go from Finance to Aerospace/Commercial Space industries?

A. What Things can I do to bulk my resume with Aerospace goodness?
B. What Sort of jobs will be big in the coming years - business side of these industries? 

I obviously know that grad schools are the main reset button for careers

1. Debt load + Opportunity cost of not working is quite a high price
2. Ive been taught if you do not go to the top ten MBA programs then dont go. Would it be better to try to go to a top MBA program that aerospace Companies target or to attempt to get a masters of science or something like that in Aerospace focus?

We know helicopter blades encounter vibratory loads (primarily at 1/rev frequency) as a result of small dissimilarities between blades and the aerodynamic environment. Trail edge tabs on the helicopter blades are added to help increase stability, and time consuming. I am interested in the use of shape memory alloys used as *in-flight* tracking mechanisms/actuators to control the trailing edge tab in the helicopter blades.

Does anyone know whether or not this option is still being explored as a somewhat common solution to helicopter blades? If it isn't being explored, and I know certain Nitinol shape memory alloys were produced to create a deflection of nearly 20 degrees have been obtained. I'm not sure, however, whether this was ever put into use.

Can someone enlighten me?

Clearly this is not a realistic goal in the pure sense. Many (probably most) of the technologies developed for one purpose are, and would quickly be adapted to it.

So I would just like to get a sense of how the aerospace industry tends to organize projects between civil and defense, or project lifecycle perspective.

There are many companies that develop exclusively for defense. Outside of newspace, such a company would not be able to survive long, and thus would be rare or non-existent. Is this correct?

I have many years of test engineering experience (hardware and software), and am concerned about it hurting my future career prospects. Additionally, I am one of those people who is extremely results-oriented. I would take a job doing grunt work for minimum wage if it meant I had the chance to contribute to an interesting and important company/project. I'm not unrealistic-- I'm not expecting to get a job as a test engineer at SpaceX (though that would be my ultimate dream job, as I'm sure is the case for 99% of other people here)-- I'm applying for jobs similar to my prior ones at all kinds of aerospace-related companies, even including companies like airlines and component suppliers. I am also totally open to jobs that are unrelated to my past experience.

Anyway, only jobs in totally unrelated industries. I don't think there's anything grievously wrong with my resume or experience, as I've asked recruiters, my advisor, and classmates point-blank. And I have no problem getting jobs in other tech fields-- but that is not what I'm looking for.
