I'm a computer security and distributed systems guy. I've did audits and trainings at many large banks and lotteries and also built complicated stuff like a quantum cryptography engine and a p2p file sync engine. I also worked at TradeHill for 3 months in 2011. You can learn more about me here http://paulbohm.com/about/

You may also know me from a Bitcoin article I wrote two years ago that's popular on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Bitcoin/Is-the-cryptocurrency-Bitcoin-a-good-idea 

I'm really annoyed at the exchange software quality and yesterday spontaneously tweeted that I'd start working on an open-source high-performance highly-secure exchange engine and asked if anyone wants to join me in my San Francisco apartment.

Seven people showed up, someone who previously built a payment system and an angel investor. They all were tremendous help in nailing down the core architecture. Later today another friend will come by who is an expert in B-tree filesystem design, which will help with getting the data structures right.

I'm doing some explorative coding at http://github.com/buttercoin/buttercoin and note-taking at http://buttercoin.hackpad.com/ but it's really just a rough outline right now.

Basically I want to build something similar to the LMAX architecture (http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html)

Let me know if any of you are interested in joining a hipchat or hackpad and discussing the design

I can't promise this will succeed - before yesterday I had no plans or ambition to write an exchange

You can email me at enki@bbq.io or if you want to motivate me send donations to 1McqPj92jvWfFg5F24dwyDSUptjTosH2EY (i will donate any funds received to the bitcoin foundation should I not succeed at building buttercoin).

I am not a wealthy man.  I am actually quite poor and have a lot of student loan debt.  But I have good credit.  I have applied for, which I have slowly been investing in bitcoin for the past two months.  I started when it was $14/BTC.  At this second, it is $25.10/BTC.  I have invested some of it in satoshidice, and the rest will be stored in an offline wallet.

I may someday regret this decision.  It represents the exact amount of my entire retirement and savings accounts.  If bitcoin ever becomes worthless, I will someday be a wealthy man and my family will be set.  

I am not doing this out of greed

I am not going to post again until a year from now.  And then I will post each year following.  Wish me luck.

EDIT:  Thank you all for the feedback.  I expected some opposition and advice.  I have received more than enough

UPDATE 4/9/13:  I won't give a full accounting until after a year, or at least pay my debts back and enjoy some time off from work for a while... or forever.

UPDATE 4/10/13:  All:  I cashed out $30, and 242 price points.  It was just getting too stressful watching all the recent gains and corrections.  I will have a little seller's remorse as the price continues to go up, but I also feel relieved that all the coins I have at this point are icing on the cake.  Plus, I am hopeful that my incoming Avalons will generate a lot more down the line.  More later.

UPDATE 4/11/13:  A few have suggested that I have played a role in the recent correction with my decision to cash out my initial investment.  I highly doubt that, at whatever price that is.

UPDATE 5/15/13:  What a month.  I took the plunge and quit my job a few weeks ago.  Last day is Friday.  I was told by my supervisor I could ""come back anytime, I cashed out about 100 coins when the price was $76 a few weeks back.  Talk about a panic sell!  I didn't post the update here in the off chance it would influence the market as some of you speculated.  That should get me through the next few months until all the ASICs arrive and start hashing.  After that, who knows.  I have a new lease on life right now, and have been exercising and spending tons of time with my kids the past few days as I wound down time at my job.

**TLDR: I started a website in April to sell products for bitcoins. I offered to give bitcoins to customers purchasing via PayPal. This violated PayPal's Terms. They gave me two days to stop, they just decided to end my service. If you're using PayPal and Bitcoin as payment methods, you may be okay, but be careful how you market. Learn from my mistake(s).**

 started selling brand name and budget electronics for bitcoins in April. I decided to give my customers an option to pay with PayPal or BitPay. If they paid with PayPal, I'd give free shipping and 10% off the sale price of the products. 

Things were going great until PayPal somehow found out. I was asked not to continue that incentive marketing model, and by Monday, before I could even provide the info, they just decided to hell with me. They told me they didn't want to deal with a site that was selling using bitcoins. Blew my mind.

I've checked out a couple payment providers available to Canadian business and one wouldn't allow me to sell products for bitcoins on the same domain as non-btc purchases that they would be used for.

So

**Edit:** Because my inbox is exploding with people asking for the web address

I've decided

To be fair, prior to me shipping the goods), but the bitcoins were lost. I hadn't published the list, as I wrote it in anger, and as an old friend of mine always said, never send an email (publish a page) when you're angry. Wait until you've had time to cool down and re-read it. I had marked the page as hidden on my Big Commerce site, unaware that it was actually published. (A Reddit user brought it up here). I have since removed the page all together, this was the claim that caused PayPal to investigate my account.

In their eyes (and probably the government's too)

My primary goal is to delivery brand name and budget electronics and gadgets for bitcoins at reasonable and competitive prices. My attempts at giving away bitcoins with each purchase was to spread the word about bitcoins. I want to get more people interested in using the currency

**Edit 2**: PayPal just called me with some information that may be of interest. 

They have informed me that due to the recently high number of transactions involving bitcoins, or via other websites - PayPal on the other hand will not allow people to sell, or transfer any amount of bitcoins in relation to a sale via their service. 

This is due to numerous chargebacks by users buying bitcoins, and I think this clears up some of the ambiguity as to why PayPal isn't dealing with businesses that are doing transactions involved with bitcoins (giving away bitcoins with a purchase like I was doing led to at least once instance of a customer receiving the bitcoins and filing a dispute). 

I'm not sure if PayPal is against bitcoins

There is still no word on whether I will be allowed to do business with them in the future

Buyers however need to be assured that once they send their bitcoins to a website (especially a new website like mine), search for reviews of the site, or find a site that has been well established.

We've been here before. 
Many times in fact.  Peer through our history and you'll see that the [value of a bitcoin has fluctuated many times in the past.](http://i.imgur.com/E0jriM7.jpg)  And that's okay.  

By design

What caused this most recent price rise?  A variety of positive factors:

* The block reward halving last December from 50 to 25 made bitcoin supply all the more scarce.  

* Demand could now comfortably outpace supply

* Companies became heavily delayed in the development ASIC products

* Companies involved with bitcoin began [posting positive profits](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/bitcoin-based-casino-rakes-in-over-500000-profit-in-six-months/) early in the year. Bitcoin caught on with merchants &amp; investors alike.

* Bitcoins became accepted as a form of payment by [many companies

* FinCen regulations were seen as the first step towards legitimacy

Most importantly though

But it's a cycle that can't continue indefinitely, (690 billion) then each bitcoin would be worth roughly $32,000.  But I can't stress this enough: **this is only the 2nd reward era, 3600 BTC are still being made each day, and it will be a long time before scarcity can sustain those high values.** 

What's going to happen now is that the market will search for an equilibrium value between the amount of BTC mined each day and the demand for it.  Bitcoin is absolutely prone to overshoot this value, bitcoin will become more and more scarce, further sustaining its ability to hold value.  

This is not the worst correction we've ever endured either.   June 2011 saw the peak of a 33-fold rise in value, escrow, and trust](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA&amp;list=WLB84DFF3E3B6A009E) will come all in due time.  And you may participate in any way you wish.  

What is Bitcoin?  It's an experiment
Don't make it out to be something its not.  It is not a get rich quick scheme.  It is potentially an investment but also a risky one.  Advice is abound in this subreddit but remember that no one can perfectly predict the future, and myself and other helpful members of this forum will always be around to assist in any way we can.

However, and it has potential enemies, and I think there's a very good chance that the currency could be basically destroyed overnight.

*THE PROBLEMS:*

1. **The code.** Bitcoin is not a magic black box. It's a complicated piece of open-source software

2. **The value of exploits.** With the soaring value of Bitcoins, it would be almost impossible to discover the culprit or recover any losses. [This was already happening when there was almost nothing to gain from it!](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0)

3. **Government intervention.** Currency manipulation is one of the core economic controls of government. Mass adoption of Bitcoin would render this tool ineffective, such a move would cause a rapid exodus of significant funds, by a few small high-worth individuals over a very short timescale. This, combined with the effect of legislation, would almost inevitably trigger a large-scale panic sell-off, and there would be no market remaining to allow for the currency's revival.

4. **Corporate sabotage.** Moneygram, despite its rapid expansion and long-term potential, is tiny compared to many large organisations which have a vested interest in seeing the currency fail. At its current size, the Bitcoin economy could be toppled for a handful of million dollars- enough to buy and sell large volumes specifically to cause huge price swings, to undermine confidence with smear campaigns, or to directly attack flaws in the software or the network that underpins it.

5. **Fundamental flaws.** The design of Bitcoin is not perfect. We're already seeing the blockchain becoming bloated by the micro-transactions of SatoshiDice. What if the volume of these were to rise a thousandfold

With the current public interest in the currency, I believe that Bitcoin is extremely vulnerable at present. Any one of the problems listed could trigger a panic which would crash the currency overnight, and in a way that it wouldn't likely recover from.

1)	Do not spend more than you can afford to lose! For a good guide
2)	Have an exit strategy, but I can tell you that if there isn’t a burst, there will be a correction. And the higher and faster things rise, the harder they fall. Once a correction is triggered, people will panic, and trading sites will be overloaded and even crash. trading sites may even go bankrupt. New accounts can be slow to be approved or delayed indefinitely. This is why you should have at least 2 trading accounts made, and linked to a bank account. And test them, and it reaches $500. Then it starts falling, and we are at 275. You make the trade at 250. You could have had it at 350 had you registered. You finally get the money and have it transferred. Hey,000
Now by all means, and encourage vendors to accept them. This ‘bubble’ is only a small part of the big picture. But for those of you who have $40K in bitcoins and only $300 in your pocket, well, this advice is for you.

Here's the problem.  I haven't bought any bitcoins.  Here's why:

1. The slew of posts talking about ""securing your wallet"".  A laptop with no hard drive?  Live linux installs? ""Disable all internet connections!"" etc.  Not to mentioin the stories that pop up of people ""missing"" bitcoins. I get it - online wallet's are not as secure but the work that goes into having a secure wallet on my deskstop seems to daunting.  Solution: An online wallet with some guarantees.

2. I can't spend it.  I don't want to buy drugs.  Every other place I can use bitcoin just instantly exchanges it for dollars.  If that's the case, or a ""locked in"" price or action figure.  Something.

3. Complexity of purchase.  I figured I'd buy a few bitcoins to play around with.  So far, but they don't have the depth to sell.  Someone needs to fill this void.

1369251650.0,1eurf8,Bitcoin gets another day in court- I had to testify for 30 minutes,btcthinker,799,139,271,"I invested in Bitcoin in June of 2012 and I've done pretty well since then. Today I was posting bond for a friend of mine who was booked on a drug-related charge and I sold some BTC to cover the bond. I had to produce statements from MtGox in order to show how I obtained the money. I was grilled by the prosecution for about 30 minutes regarding Bitcoin. The prosecution had looked up some stuff in Bitcoin and they were trying to argue that I might have obtained the money by illegitimate means (i.e. laundering money)

**Some of the questions I was asked by the prosecution:**  
1. Is it true that Bitcoin is not regulated by any state?  
2. You are aware that MtGox is not a registered money transmitter?   
3. Bitcoin is not a real currency in the sense you can't use it in Wal-Mart
4. Your MtGox account is not an investment account, correct?  
5. Is it true that Bitcoin is not the official legal tender of any country or jurisdiction?  
6. Is it your understanding that Bitcoin is not regulated by FinCEN?  
7. Do you realize gains from the rise or fall of the current Bitcoin price?  
8. Do you know how Bitcoin mining works?  
9. Do you mine Bitcoins?  
(there are many other questions in the span of 30 minutes

**My answers:**  
1. Yes
2. Objection by defense and sustained.  
3. Is that relevant? (the judge said that he's going to determine if it's relevant and I should just answer the question) ... Yes
4. It's not a traditional investment account
5. Objection by the defense (asked and answered) and sustained.  
6. Yes. Objection by the defense
7. Yes. It works just like any other investment: you buy in at a certain price and you sell at a different price. If I have profit
8. Yes.  
9. No.  

**Statements by the prosecution (most of them dismissed by the judge):**  
1. Bitcoin is used for money laundering and other illegal activities.  
2. Bitcoin is not a real currency.  
He went on about how it's not regulated, but the judge agreed with the defense that the statements from MtGox are sufficient to prove where the money came from. The judge also made statements that this seems to be in line with any other investment and it should be accepted as a legal source for the bond.  

**Closing statement from the defense (this was the best part):**  
""Some people like to keep their money in the bank, erupted in laughter)** However, that's not grounds for rejecting the bond. It is entirely reasonable that the witness, who is x-years-old, not married, has no children, has no mortgage and makes x amount of money per year is capable of producing the bond amount.""

The reason I feel compelled to write this is because I am SO tired of hearing people bitch or speculate that “wallstreet” somehow in some way has been manipulating the market. As a representative of one of the big 4 wirehouses

So I have been following bitcoins for a year or so now. Since about late March with the explosion of coverage I have made it my personal goal to survey as many people as I can in “the industry” on whether or not they too have any interest in bitcoins. The answer? Almost 0. Part in this is because the average age of a wallstreet employee is 62. I asked the simple question “hey

The notion that wallstreet is behind these “pump and dumps” is retarded. At its peak the bitcoin market cap was what $2.5 billion maybe $3 billion. Wow!!! The size of a mid-cap stock! Jee-wiz!! I could probably name 500 companies that none of you have heard of, they would just use a small stock. The entry/exit is 1000000x easier than bitcoins. 

I think back to playing Diablo 2 and trading the “virtual goods” in that game. When a Windforce went from $20, we simply understood there was an extremely high demand in our very niche market and within the community there was somebody out there comfortable spending $500 on an item that doesn’t even exist (tell that to my Amazon!).  

But what about all the articles on yahoo.com/finance &amp; cnn.com/money?!? No legitimate investor on wallstreet uses either of these mediums as a source for news. Even if this made the front page of Barrons or the WSJ – it would just be another one of those articles most people just skip over (like 3D printing

My last 2 thoughts… 

Any mutual fund, managers will bend the rules from time to time and invest outside of the box. Perhaps going 35% emerging markets when the prospectus says they can only go 30%. But there is NO CHANCE in HELL any of them would risk their firms asses to go so far outside the realm of what was set up to put real investors’ money in bitcoins. Yes, there was that ETF or two that was a “bitcoin ETF”. But hell… if you look deep enough I’m sure you can find a World of Warcraft ETF… There is one in practically every space. 

Me personally

I am more than happy to continue this conversation. On a complete side note – as a day trader I am more than happy to share in insight or prospective on any charts relative to BTC/LTC/PPC/TRC/NVC. I do REALLY enjoy trading alternate currencies as a hobby. Feel free to send me a PM.

--------------

Unfortunately, or next week, or next month, or next year. Guessing short term price movements is a fool's game. 

My sentiment is the same today as it was a year or two years ago:  either Bitcoin is worth zero, then it's a good idea to hold on to some Bitcoins. If you think it's just too risky, or are unconvinced of the narrative, then it's best to sell. As stated many times, Bitcoins are incredibly risky and volatile. The whole thing is one grand experiment. Don't ever hold more money in Bitcoin than you can afford to lose, and in general you should assume the whole thing will go to zero.

Now

1) A handful of ""respectable"" online merchants are now accepting Bitcoin

2)  Cyprus scared the hell out of everyone (and rightly so). While a few Cypriots may have bought some Bitcoin, but rather that the world realizes that as this euro (and soon dollar...) crisis continues unfolding, a greater number of people will seek some degree of refuge in Bitcoin. Speculators, seeing this possibility, are buying up Bitcoins.

3) Venture capital (and private investor) money is moving into Bitcoin. A handful of VC firms putting in a handful of money would explain the current price rise.
 
4) An increasingly wide swath of the libertarian/gold &amp; silver ""hard money"" types are buying into Bitcoin. They were very skeptical at first

5) The FinCEN ruling clarified the government's stance on Bitcoin about 3 weeks ago. The good news is Bitcoin is very much legal

6) The press attention gained from all of the above real-world events is fueling a huge amount of hype (justified or not). 

7) Ignorant, or impoverish themselves, but either way they're in it for the wrong reason.

All of the above have combined over the past couple months to cause this price rally. It may well be a bubble, it could be the start of a mega bubble that drives prices over $1000 before they come crashing down somewhere and cause widespread misery and chaos. The price right now could be the highest Bitcoin will ever be from now on, or the lowest. Nobody knows!

My advice... don't obsess over the fluctuating price on any given day. The market will figure out the value of these coins

But certainly

It's a really great piece of technical work

As you can see

Next, experimental, and no one really knows what will happen with it and what people will do with it.  It is this way with all new technologies.  This means that there is the possibility that unexpected or bad things happen, and we may have to modify or suspend our implementation of Bitcoin support if that happens.  We think that adding Bitcoin support is very worthwhile, but having worked in the online payments industry for awhile for a player (PayPal) which in its early years hoped greatly to reform and revolutionize the global money system, I know that things can be complicated and not always turn out the way you intend them.  I hope things go well, and so I ask the Bitcoin supporters here to help us make that happen.  I believe that adding Bitcoin support to reddit will help it gain a fair bit of press

I've worked in the computer security industry almost since it was created

1.  You simply cannot trust computer hardware manufacturers.  [Hardware Backdoor's](http://www.darkreading.com/advanced-threats/black-hat-researcher-demonstrates-hardwa/240004674) are real and more prevalent than you can imagine.  The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system.  Fabricating your own silicon chips is a [surprisingly simple process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GQmtITMdas)

2.  Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language.  Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the [Ken Thompson Hack](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack).

3.  Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet.  Some people might suggest using Linux,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for [rootkits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit) might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.

4.  Create your own bitcoin client.  Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors

5.  Dig a very deep hole into the earth, or high tech peeping tom.  A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common [keystroke sound vibration attacks](http://gcn.com/articles/2011/10/18/smart-phone-sensors-steal-keystrokes.aspx).  Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave.

6.  Before generating your public private key pair

7.  Once your wallet is setup

8.  This is the most important: *Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground*.  Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe)  [water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding).

1371820357.0,1gsiwy,An Update from Mt. Gox,WeAreMtGox,529,100,170,"Dear Mt. Gox Customers and Bitcoiners

The reaction since yesterday’s statement regarding the temporary suspension of U.S. dollar withdrawals has had mixed reactions

1) The problem with the U.S. withdrawals (and even other currencies for that matter) is that our bank can no longer handle the volume of withdrawals. They struggled in the last two months, but it was sudden for us as well. 

2) We are now working with new banks and alternative methods for transmitting money to our customers. This does not mean we are stopping entirely within the next two weeks, but we are dedicated to doing as many per day as possible. We announced a suspension in order to manage expectations while we deliver at a temporary reduced rate. Our goal is to have a new system set up in the next weeks with clarity for both the banks and for our customers. 

3) Our previous release was rather vague, but our kind of business is completely new to the banking industry. Processing international wires does not just involve pushing a button. It requires real manpower processing everything individually, even in this modern computer age. While Bitcoin's power lies in its ability to transfer fast and securely through software, the rest of the financial world does not operate like that (contrary to popular opinion). Money is surprisingly analog in many ways, and scarily digital in others.  

4) Every customer’s funds are safe, in our dealings with the Japanese financial regulators we have been assured that we are not under local pressure or suspicion and can operate as usual within normal legal frameworks. 

5) Mt. Gox is certainly not a martyr, regulators, banks, and a media that still doesn't quite understand what Bitcoin is. This is a job we are happy to fill, and not just because we are compensated for it. Our hope is that, once Bitcoin finds its place, we will be able to say that we made a difference in sorting it all out in the early days. New exchanges, merchants

6) As risky as it is to invoke the name of Litecoin (LTC???), though that depends on a few things. Mainly, we want to do things correctly from the beginning.

Well

The front I have taken thus far with ccn is that submissions which directly break the rules (including obvious plagiarism which we enforce while not having a strict rule for) get individually marked as spam. /u/PLURFellow and /u/xrandr in particular have been quite helpful at reporting and disambiguating rulebreaking posts.

I view banning an entire domain as a big step for a number of reasons. Not least of which is sparking an arms race of throwaway domains and url shortners

We do already have a bot mod that is cousins with Automoderator. /u/theymos runs it so ultimately he's the chap you'd need to sell on the idea of opening up the domain-banning can o worms. :3

Amagi Metals would like to reach out to the bitcoin community for your help and support.

We have worked with BotW since 2011. In the last month they began requesting information about our business and claiming that we were a Money Service Business (MSB). However we only accept bitcoins as a payment method

Today we heard back from the bank that they are closing down our account and that we can no longer use BotW after mid-August. They think that we are a ""risk"" because we accept bitcoins as a payment method.

So

Please note that we plan on continuing business as usual and this will not affect our current business operations. Thank you for all your help and support!

5)Wire money out at any time on your schedule and not on the schedule of the Exchange

5)Support of 22 Currencies so you can maintain your funds at your choice of Currency without converting to USD

We are in the process of working out our terms and fees as we try to keep the fees such as wire in wire out and any maintenance fees to the bare minimum.

*I'm fluent in Chinese, and I've owned a fair share of bitcoins since mid 2012 and litecoins since two months ago.*

Here's what I thought of the CCTV Documentary from the perspective of someone who's originally from China

**= Initial Reactions =**

- The documentary was fairly accurate, how mining works, and the prices.
- The documentary seemed to be pro-bitcoin
- It is clear that the Chinese government (who does in fact censor
- CCTV is pretty big in Chinese news

**= Ramifications =**

- I believe we'll see more news coverage on BTC in China
- Many Chinese citizens are fairly technologically savy
- If China decides to adopt/promote bitcoin
- To Chinese citizens

**= Predictions =**

- If the Chinese bitcoin exchange fairs well and plays it's cards right
- Chinese companies will begin to produce cheaper and more powerful mining 
- The price will shoot up as citizens begin buying coins.  However
- Chinese hackers will realize how effective the denial of service operations were
- The Chinese blackmarket may very well adopt bitcoin and begin selling goods and services on a platform.  They may use Silkroad

So my advice to all of you newcomers:

 - [Don't panic](http://allymalinenko.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dont-panic.jpg)
 - Invest only as much in Bitcoin as you can afford to lose
 - Unless you are a day trader
 - ~~Weekend dips are a common occurrence~~
 - When you are new to Bitcoin
 - If you decide to stick around for longer

Following those guidelines you should have a more enjoyable time. However

I wrote this guide because I believe that an informed userbase is key to Bitcoin's success!

Rough summary TL;DR:

* User Bob creates a transaction by declaring: ""I give Alice 10 BTC"". (But in Bitcoin protocol language).
* This transaction is digitally signed with the private key each address has and can't be forged.
* The miners make sure the transaction is valid and record it in a public ledger that is distributed over the whole network.
* Alice check this ledger to get her balance.
* Bob can't cheat the system because everyone in the network can consult and check this ledger and would immediately refuse a transaction with double spent funds or funds he hasn't got in the first place.

-----

You can start using Bitcoin in a matter of seconds and

With Bitcoin it is you who has control over the money and you need to take care of it responsibly. 

**The following text is a very simple guide that will introduce you to the nature of the Bitcoin network and explain what happens during a Bitcoin transaction in a very simple way.**

*The Story of Alice and Bob*

Once upon a time... there was a reddit user called Bob who wanted to send his friend Alice some bitcoins. He knows that Alice needs 10 BTC and so he decided to send them to her. 

Bob has got a Bitcoin Wallet with some bitcoins and before clicking the send button he wonders where his bitcoins are actually stored. *""Is every Bitcoin a file on my computer? Or a serial number maybe?*""

Bob quickly notices that this would be very inefficient. What would happen if someone was spying on his connection and intercepted this files? And what would happen if the connection dropped?

No. **The way Bitcoin works is simple and elegant.**

When Bob sends Alice 10 Bitcoin

""I

Of course

These declarations are protected by a mechanism known as [Digital Signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature). It is an implementation of mathematics and very strong cryptography that guarantees that only the owner can produce a valid signature. Else

**Digital Signatures**

You probably already know that in order to receive and send bitcoins you need a Bitcoin adress. Just like with email. And just like with email you need ""your password"" to be able to send and receive bitcoins. 

Bitcoin Adresses are generated using mathematics and they can be generated in a decentralized manner. You don't need to login anywhere nor do you need to be online. You just need a program capable of generating such an address. 

A Bitcoin address

* **A public part** - Give this to anybody so they can send you bitcoins. 

* **A private key** - This is what most users don't know. Each Bitcoin address has got it's own very unique key. Most Bitcoin programs don't tell you about this and they keep the keys hidden from the user

This is the key used to digitally sign a transaction and to guarantee that only the owner of the key can emit a valid transaction and thus spend those bitcoins.

**Back to Alice and Bob**

Once Bob's bitcoin wallet has signed this transaction

Bob's transaction gets relayed from node to node. These nodes verify that the signature is valid and pass it on until

*""Nice!""* Alice thinks. But at the same time she's worried about something else. Alice knows how the Bitcoin network works and ponders whether it was possible for Bob to make up that amount. 

She knows for sure that it was Bob who sent the money because the digital signature matches. But what would have stopped Bob from writing down any arbitrary amount? What if Bob would have said ""I give 1 Bazillion Bitcoins to Alice?"". *Whie Alice keeps thinking about it

**Meet Miner Steve**

As the transaction keeps hopping from node to node in the Bitcoin network

Steve's objective is to collect all transactions and publish them in a sort of ledger. In order to guarantee Bitcoin's decentralized and open nature

Miner Steve and other miners are running a program on their computer that helps them solve extremely difficult mathematical problems. Steve knows that only the miner who finds the solution to such a problem is authorized to publish the next block of this ledger that contains all the collected transactions.

All miners are competing with each other because they want to be the first to solve the problem

In order for Bob to have 10 BTC in the first place, with a little bit of luck, his computer program is the first one to find the solution. 

*Guess what?* Today's Steve's lucky day! 
He finds the solution and immediately publishes all the transactions he has collected. The rest of the network verifies that the solution is correct and watches dumbfolded as Steve gets the reward. But there's no time to lose because new transactions never stop arriving and new blocks of this ledger always await to be published. 

**The blockchain**

This ledger is known as the Blockchain. It is called a chain

What if someone decided to maliciously edit a previous block and assign themselves thousands and thousands of bitcoins? Fortunately this is impossible. If one were to change one single digit

Also

The openness, where absolutely no one can cheat. 

**Back to Alice**

As soon as Miner Steve published the next block of the blockchain, as it was the case, made sure to inform Alice that her transaction was *confirmed* and is now a permanent part of the Bitcoin network. **Transactions that are included in the blockchain receive a confirmation.**

Notice how Alice doesn't need to be online in order to receive bitcoins. She could be offline for hours

Actually

Once she wants to spend them

Take a look at http://www.bitaddress.org . This is an online Bitcoin Adress generator that lets you see the private key. 

**About Bitcoin Security**

As you can see

You are the sole owner of your bitcoins and it is thus your responsibility to keep the private key to those coins safe. Many bitcoin wallets will encrypt these keys using a password you provide. This is extremely recommended. 

Also make sure that your computer is free from keyloggers

**Where does Miner Steve get the reward from?**

He gets it from the voluntary fees that are included in each Bitcoin transaction. That's why he wants to collect and publish as much transactions as possible because he gets the fees associated with them. 

Also

Are 21 million bitcoins enough? Yes

**Why does it take so long for my Bitcoin Wallet to synchronize?**

The first time you run a full Bitcoin Wallet

If Bitcoin is going to work, and the one thing nerds are bad at is figuring out how to include non-nerds.

So, prohibits them from withdrawing or sending more than 1000 dollar worth of Bitcoin a day, calls them up when someone tries to withdraw large amounts, and if things *still* go wrong, is willing to pay out to people who lost their savings.

I have launched a blog here www.blog.bit-banking.eu in the first post there is a PDF that gives a better overview of everything that we will be doing and how we shall overcome the obstacles we will face in getting the Cypriot people to use our services.

Constructive feedback is appreciated and we already have several hundred merchants willing to accept our payment terminals and a large number of people that are waiting for our branches to open so they can move their funds away from their mattresses and into an account held with Ploutos Bank.

If we treat Bitcoin as a trading stock, Bitcoin will become more of a stock than a currency. On the other hand, if we want to establish Bitcoin as a digital currency we must shift our focus a bit more from exchange price and trading to online merchants.

""recently received a full refund from BFL for an order I placed several months ago.

I know, there's ""final"", and then there's ""final""...

It took a month

-I sent an email to office@butterflylabs.com in which I politely requested a refund.

-About a week later

-I filed a dispute with PayPal. In this dispute I noted that BFL failed to deliver

-PayPal closed my dispute the same day

-I called PayPal's customer service and complained about my dispute being closed

-I sent an email to fraud@paypal.com in which I listed my transaction and dispute number

-A few days later

-I waited a week to give BFL plenty of time to contact me.  They didn't.

-I emailed the PayPal Customer Solutions Supervisor and told him that BFL had not contacted me. He seemed shocked. I wasn't. He told me that PayPal could take action against BFL if necessary.

-The PayPal Customer Solutions Supervisor escalated my dispute to the next level (whatever that is).  He told me that someone else would call.

-The next day I received a call from a guy named Bruce at BFL. He told me that since I had complained to PayPal, I just wanted my money back. He wouldn't give me a firm answer and just kept repeating that they were placing my order ""under review"" and taking it out of the queue. I even asked if this review would take a day, week, month, or year. No answer, just the same ""under review"" statement.

-Within 5 minutes of BFL's call

-My payment to BFL was refunded to my PayPal account the next business day.

BFL needs PayPal. If you want your money back

We have interest already from some people who may be able to immediately open Bitspend up to process many more orders daily so we hope that happens soon.  If you placed an order already, we will be processing it today - do not worry!  As always, email us at support@bitspend.net with any questions or concerns you have

[**/EDIT 4**]


Hey guys 

We are [Bitspend.net](https://bitspend.net), you place your order with us by giving us the URL of the item(s) you want.  We send you an invoice and ask for your shipping details.  Once you've paid in Bitcoins, we place your order for you just as if you would have ordered it yourself.  The order is placed based on the URL and details you give us, and shipped directly to you which is why we ask for your shipping details.

For those of you who are as privacy-minded as we are

We were planning on allowing Anonymous payments using Blockchain.info, and ordering using our accounts on the chosen websites of your products - there is really no definitive way to tie a Bitcoin payment to an order we place, especially if multiple split-payments are made.   Again, this option is only for those of you who want another layer of privacy.  For the rest of you, read our privacy policy regarding your data.

We plan on accommodating orders up to $5,000 in a few weeks.  For now, while we iron out our processes, we will be in an open beta and will allow orders up to $100.  We will accept orders above $100 on a case by case basis, just email us at orders@bitspend.net and we will happily help you.

Our goal is to provide the absolute best customer service possible.  In an effort to do that, /r/bitspend, and any forum accounts to answer any and every question possible. 

The end goal of this and the Bitcoin community is to have all retailers online accept bitcoin - however that is not likely to happen at your larger companies for years if ever.  We plan to bridge that gap for as long as needed

We know a lot of trust is needed in a business like ours - the guys over a pizzaforcoins.com have helped pave the way for honest start-ups to provide services letting you buy things with Bitcoins you cant otherwise.  In an effort to be as transparent as possible, we are not a disappearing scam, but instead we are in it for the long-haul and have a few surprises coming in the months ahead that we hope will shake up the Bitcoin marketplace everywhere.

1367598080.0,1dmjyg,Bitcoin from a banker prospective; a serious discussion and solutions,bitfan2013,322,54,293,"Let me know your opinion

First I think Bitcoin is a great concept that is sorely needed in today’s Global – Fast moving internet economy. I am personally a true fan of Bitcoin of its openness and transparency. My family and I sit on the board of directors of 4 small – medium sized private banks. Over the past couple of months as the big hoopla over Bitcoin has garnered worldwide media attention

I know that Bitcoiners everywhere believe that the Banks are scared of Bitcoin and are out to crush it; however, and provide credit to others to use your money to fund their home, car, business, etc… there is no big mystery or conspiracy behind it. They just don’t want to get fined by not complying with the AML/KYC bylaws.

HSBC was recently fined $1.9 Billion just for that. Now maybe HSBC as one of the world largest banks can handle a $1.9 Billion fine
Bitcoin solves many issues on a global scale providing the ability to move “currency” for almost no fees

I would personally love to setup a Virtual Exchange account in one of our banks and have recently discussed that options with the Board of Directors

So let’s cut the banks a break and really dive down to the core issue that Bitcoin is facing: Fiat to Bitcoin and back to Fiat. A real Fiat Bank from scratch should be setup by Bitcoin users, not just one exchange account as we have today.  If there is an issue with one account, only that account is dealt with not freezing all other accounts. Any account holder would transfer funds from their existing Bank account to their Bitcoin bank personal account.  An escrow exchange clearing account can be setup to transfer funds in and out internally within the bank for executed trades between buyers and sellers of Bitcoin on the exchange open market.  So your money will be in your personal private account and not in a here today gone tomorrow exchange account that has thousands of exchange customers funds tied up together with your money.

So if the Bitcoin community chooses to look at Bitcoin as a long term solution and not as a quick get rich scheme then the only viable long term solution for the success of Bitcoin is for members to join forces and form the First true Bitcoin-Fiat Bank. Serious replies only.

I would recommend opening a Bank in one of the few Bank Friendly nations like Panama. You could still receive a Banking license for a $3 Million Security Deposit. It requires Class B license to be authorized to do business with clients from all over the world

        
The Idea of this thread is to measure the community's reaction and feedback to a such a proposal

Just Revised:
We could use the open Bitcoin idea

TLDR: Reposted from user:doyourduty below:

1) OP comes from a family of bankers

2) Banks aren't afraid of bitcoin

3) Too many unaccounted for funds can cause a huge penalty

4) Main problem is bitcoin&lt;--&gt;fiat

5) OP's Solution: An international bitcoin bank in panama where fraudulent activity within a specific account could be dealt with individually instead of screwing everyone (i.e. bitfloor

6) A personal bank account
and you and only you would have control and access to this account

7) Internal bank exchange from BTC to your currency would be performed instantly with other bank account holders though an escrow instant account to provide anonymity. 

8) The Bank will act as any other bank as far as Fiat is concerned but will also provide you with the option to convert your Currency into BTC at any time from multiple open exchanges that will open accounts with the bank.

Due to the overwhelming consensus that I should *do something*, BTC address, email, phone number, description of him, time we met, everything I can think of.

With that said, email, or phone number. I know, the pitchforks are raised, but I think it's for the best:

1) I do know 100% that it was a mixer address and nothing else. Unless you are in control of the mixing service

2) The email appears to be a throwaway or unused

3) Phone number. My best bet for a police report

With that said, it's probably going to be overlooked, but hopefully it might be used later down the line, if he is a perpetual scammer.

In those days I was super-broke and struggling to recover after trying to go in full-time for music alone...of course I didn't put any hope into this but thought I'd support the idea because I liked the decentralized way of doing things.

Bitcoin, like the euro zone, where government meddling in native currency valuations has left many distrustful of the money in their bank accounts.

Americans don’t have this problem -- yet. And that may be a problem in itself. According to bitcoin proponents, Americans risk ceding to the Chinese and others control of the future of what could be the most disruptive force in monetary exchanges since the credit card. In turn, the dollar and the ability of the U.S. to navigate global currency conflicts could be seriously weakened.

“Here’s the bottom line: Bitcoin has much higher popularity outside the U.S. and much higher potential outside the U.S., there’s this new thing, bitcoin,’ they say, ‘Well, what’s wrong with the dollar?’ That question is different in other countries.”

Bitcoins are a finite,975 bitcoins are in circulation, all of which have been purchased on exchange networks or mined. The currency is mined using software that processes transactions on the bitcoin network, adding groups of transactions, called blocks, to the chain. Miners are paid about 25 bitcoins per block. That digital money can then be used to purchase a variety of goods online, from legitimate software to heroin on the infamous virtual black-market Silk Road.

Bitcoin surged in value to $266 last month, and Kickstarter). Suddenly, everyone was talking about buying bitcoins. But the bubble burst in late April, and in the U.S. at least, bitcoin faded from the news. That was not the case in China, where Antonopoulos said downloads of bitcoin clients have eclipsed those in the U.S.

Bitcoins are mined in several steps. After downloading a bitcoin client, even some otherwise forward-thinking American investors. The irony is that, for now, American startups are leading the bitcoin charge, and the U.S. government was the first to issue guidance on using the currency as payment -- a seemingly tacit recognition of bitcoin’s validity as legal tender.

**Why China Poses A Threat**

Feng Li

Q coins were introduced in March 2002 by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (HKG:0700), and they currently average an annual transaction value of more than 1 billion yuan ($163 million). That value is growing at about 15 to 25 percent each year.

Q coins, Tencent regulations prevented Q coins from being traded between users or converted back to yuan, but allowed users to trade points and purchase Q coins with their game accounts, then use the black market to convert them into cash. That caused concerns at the People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank. In January 2007, converting game points to Q coins was banned, and Tencent reiterated that Q coins constitute a product, which seemed to satisfy the concerns.

“There has already been proof with the Q coin

Already, as does the similar service, Tencent’s PaiPai.com.

The Chinese are embracing bitcoins in other ways. The first bitcoin fund began to raise money in June, and it will mature in four years.

Q coin’s popularity isn’t the only reason bitcoin has appeal in China. As it turns out, which provides the necessary computing power to run a successful business converting electricity into mined coins. Price caps on electricity already create wasteful use of energy in China, so running a code-crunching computer for hours on end isn’t as costly an investment as it would be in the U.S. And so-called “gold-mining” or “gold-farming” businesses already exist in China’s cybersphere. None of that will come as a surprise to any “World of Warcraft” player: Gamers in Chinese urban sweatshops are known to sit in front of glowing blue screens for hours, slaughtering players in the game for their spoils or mining gold deposits found in the sprawling milieu of Blizzard Entertainment’s international blockbuster. Those treasures are then sold to players in the game for real money.

China has a heavily controlled currency

“The more controlled the currency is, the more appealing the coin is,” Antonopoulos said, noted that the most appealing place to use bitcoin would be a country whose economy is a veritable train wreck -- like Zimbabwe, except that the southern African nation lacks the necessary technology. “I would say China is perfect,” he said. “It’s got the penetration, it’s got the smartphones, it’s got the not-as-appealing national currency.”

**Regulation In The U.S.**

Guidance issued in March by the U.S. Treasury Department said that companies issuing or exchanging online cash

Less than two months later

Federal officials obtained a warrant Tuesday to seize an account tied to Mt.Gox, of failing to register as a money-services company with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. An account held by the online-payments firm Dwolla was subsequently seized.

Many feared the warrant execution could cast a chill over the bitcoin industry as a sector centered on a borderless

That proved not to be the case, it will be used in a higher and higher amount of transactions,” he said, adding that Coinbase is registered as a money-services firm. “There’s no way there will be all this money flowing through an unregulated system.”

Chris Larsen -- the CEO of OpenCoin, [and] we actually think that’s a really good thing for the industry,” he told IBTimes. “I thought the guidance was a good idea. One of the things the guidelines seem to make clear for the first time is that a virtual currency could be used for goods and services.”

**The Price Of Regulation**

But such regulation is a slippery slope

Perhaps it begins with measures to prevent money-laundering

“Bitcoin has the potential to be a disruptive technology that would be beneficial to the economy, who plans to speak next month at a conference on virtual currencies organized by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, added: “We’re already the first country to enforce money-laundering laws against bitcoin. But the U.S. would be shooting itself in the foot if it went too far [with regulations] and either outlawed bitcoin or made the legal guidelines impossible to comply with.”

**Will China Step In?**

So far, which heavily controls the channel’s content, that the currency is worth exploring.

Some of those interviewed speculated that the Communist Party wants to see bitcoin stockpiled in China, the dollar is shaken from its perch as the world’s reserve currency.

It remains to be seen whether -- or, which is considered a necessary step for gaining a grasp on the bitcoin market, limited government control will have to allow the money, like the Internet that birthed it, to develop organically.

I've spent almost ~~300~~ 350BTC on rewards, then it was totally worth it! Hopefully this won't be the last time that we spare some coins to make the world a little brighter. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!

ps: if i forgot or omitted you
ps2: whoever bought me reddit gold: thanks! while i can see absolutely no difference at all

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



right now 1btc~=$35

1) you must donate to any charity of your choice. by this i mean any known, you get the drift. no political/social movements types of orgs. please comment/msg me if in doubt.)

2) you ~~must~~ should send a short message to the said charity

3) you must send me a verifiable receipt - i reserve the right to contact the organization you donated to before i send you any bitcoins. don't get me wrong, caring people, but there is no shortage of thieves and scammers, and i don't want to make their day.

4) your receipt WITH ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFO BLACKED OUT will be posted in the comments along with txid of your reward; hopefully this get enough momentum to actually make some impact in and outside of the btc community

... and that's it. let's get it going :) imho there's no better way to promote bitcoins than to share some.


ps: before anyone asks

- there is a limit of 5 btc per person
- i'm a very privacy oriented person
- max 100 btc to give away
- i've been quite busy lately
- for creditability i can send few btc upfront ONLY to the reputable members of the community who declare they willingness to participate


now


EDIT: you people are FUCKING AWESOME! didn't expect it to escalate so quickly. i'm currently waiting for bitcoins to confirm on my bitcointip account*
* - funny story time: if an e-wallet service charge some % of the funds you keep with them for the transactions fees


EDIT2: ugh 5 confirmations

- please don't take it personally if ask you for a receipt (or an uncesored version of one)! i just want to be as sure as possible that btc go to people who actually cared and donated!

- bitcointip bot is actually very easy to use. once tipped, check out [quick start guide](http://imgur.com/kvGk6) or even ask here if you feel lost. if you fall in love with it as i did, make sure to send some cryptolove in author's direction

- i'm going through the pms in the order i received them

EDIT3: WOW you guys mean business. since i'm pretty close to reaching 100 btc and i'm just about 1/3 through my inbox

!!! BUT !!!

when this limit (overall 250 btc) is reached i will have to stop. SO IF YOU WANT TO DONATE ONLY IF YOU ARE GETTING BTC IN RETURN PLEASE

SERIOUSLY people


EDIT4: aaaand it seems that i'm out. it's been a one crazy ride i'm keeping few btc locked for people who donated earlier but didn't send a receipt (or send a one lacking details). if they don't answer in a while i'm going to send the remaining btc to any not rewarded donations in order of their receipts incoming in my inbox [damn i don't know how to english :/]. for those few people who donated and didn't make it on the btc train,,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1362499050.0,,True

That's cool. You probably don't like it. It's where the kids hang out and it's riddled with invasions of privacy. Where do you think our biggest opportunity is? Facebook. Now walk your happy ass over to that arrow and make it red.

**The Revolution:** Let's start the next bitcoin revolution on Reddit tonight. I'm about to plant a seed that will make bitcoin a reality for the world. The goal seems impossible

Your job is to think about this. Tell people about it. Pastebin it, hack it, code it, share it, github it, develop it, then facebook it.


**What is it?** The concept is simple: Transparent integration of bitcoin onto each facebook page. Users send money to other users with the click of a button and no worries. When they ask more questions they follow a link to a simple explanation.

**What are the requirements?**

* The functionality is not dependent on facebook

* There is little or no dependence on a third party server. If code is pulled from a third party server it should be trusted and robust. Integration with a service like blockchain.info wallets or instawallet.org  are probably required - but preferrably with diversity and failover. (round robin?

* Viral - The functionality spreads from one user to another with little or no action required. Transactions default to public but may be privatized.

* simple - One or two clicks should do the trick.

* Should not require facebook user app permissions - but this may be necessary (?)

* Public - the entire framework should be posted publicly to github.


**Sounds impossible, get some coffee and make this happen.

This was entirely my fault due to screwing up with my security, and I'll be back once I've done all the things you said.**  

So those of you who don't know me. I'm a nerdy girl who mines bitcoin/altcoins and is poor. A few weeks ago I decided I was going to camwhore for the bitcoin community on /r/girlsgonebitcoin in hopes of getting some tips and paying for my groceries. 

After a week, and so I took my savings account money and went to a drugstore and sent cash to mtgox via zipzap/moneygram. The money was depositied fine into my account where it sat happily for weeks awaiting a good day to buy bitcoin. 

Having read horror stories

This morning I awoke to an email from Mt.Gox letting me know there had been a withdrawal on my account. While I logged in yesterday, and then sent the bitcoin to a vanity address.

My bitcoin wallet address is the same address I have always used when camwhoring on r/girlsgonebitcoin. Feel free to examine it. The vast majority of the btc in that wallet came from two large deposit purchases of bitcoin via my own cash. Pretty much anything over 1btc incoming I bought in cash
https://blockchain.info/address/1669nJLncdiyuwRYmBfk4D6qF4Dibz7GjQ

The bitcoin address that was used to transfer the bitcoins out of my account was this taunting one (1 Lulz): 

https://blockchain.info/address/1LuLza3QfbXP3GcABCe86MYSAy9jDq3DRm

Gox gave me this message:

There has been a withdrawal from your Mt.Gox account:



Transaction reference: 50a9344e-d627-4996-9cea-4db442acaaae
Date: 2013-05-13 09:22:02 GMT
IP: 171.25.193.20

I immediately contacted them letting them know I did not authorize this transaction. They replied with this:

Hello

Sorry for the inconvenience.Please change your email address password and Mt.Gox password immediately. Please do not use the same username and password on different services. You can use the Yubikey or Software Authentication on our Security Center to further secure your accounts.

Please file a police report in order for the police to investigate the case and make an effort to retrieve your funds. We will cooperate with the police authority in providing the necessary information for the investigation

Thanks

I replied to them:

I have software authentication via google 2ndary authorization on my account already.I also have a unique password for GOX.

I got no reply

Well? Whats the story? My account should be secure

They replied to me:

 ~~I cannot fathom how this was possible unless my money was either stolen by an insider at gox

  
  
**TLDR**
  
  
~~In any case

~~Let my misery stand as a warning. There has been lots of talk lately on bitcointalk and other forums about money dissapearing from sites like mtgox, but take every possible precaution so you don't end up losing all your money like I did.~~

 
**Last Edit before bed: Somehow an API key was put onto my account and that was used to do the withdrawal. I do not know when this occurred. I never set one up and literally had no idea what it was until I was told to look for it.  If it was done prior to my 2FA it was done literally right after I made the account as it was empty for a week or two before I made the cash deposit. If it was done after, but when I come back, my computer will be far more secure, and I suspect will be dual booting linux and windows with all my bitcoin dealings on the linux side fully encrypted.**",,False,self,1368564197.0,t3_1e9v0l

The last few hours have been eventful

You're not going to help yourself by just staring at bitcoinity/mtgox/reddit etc. constantly pressing f5

So just take a break, we have seen exponential growth over the past couple of weeks, and the current price is still higher than what it was a week or two ago.

Just my advice


peace


Edit: What we can take out of this situation is that we clearly need better exchanges that can handle large volumes of trading/traffic. We can't rely on Mt.Gox. We need to push for better quality

Hello fellow Bitcoiners! It's taken me over a week of effort, and the many outstanding lecturers - I was definitely impressed. I personally got a lot out of the conference, especially the networking with everyone, and getting to see the 'face' of Bitcoin, which might be quite different than one might imagine from only reading reddit or hanging out on IRC. I strongly recommend attending these events in the future if you can. Below I've provided a list of the 17 playlists, but please note that there were many more lectures that I could not attend occurring in parallel to these and thus I could not record those. As such, keep an eye out for the Bitcoin Foundation to release official videos to all the lectures in the near future, enjoy these!

* 2) Entering the Convention Center
* 3) Will Bitcoin Change the Payments Landscape?
* 4) Decentralized [stock] share issueing

It's DanielTaylor again and I wanted to create a simple yet intuitive post to explain the folks out there what happened a couple of hours ago. This might also be useful for bloggers or journalists who might be going to write about it in the following hours. 

**TL;DR**

- The programs that read the blockchain

- Due to a bug in 0.7

- Miners (the people who add pages to the blockchain) are told to switch to the 0.7 program so that this version gains more support and the other one is discarded. (orphaned). 

- Regular users are not affected. Their transactions are included in both ledgers and don't need to change any programs. 

- During that time

------

**The Blockchain Fork Explained**

As you might already know

This huge ledger that tells everybody how much their bitcoin addresses are worth and how many bitcoins they have. This is the central piece of the Bitcoin network and is called the Blockchain. 

It is decentralized because everybody can add a new page to the ledger when they have the correct solution to a mathematical problem and there is no central authority. 

**So

In the computer world we use programs that interpret and read files for us. In order to read the blockchain we often use the Bitcoin client from bitcoin.org.

And reading this blockchain is very important for miners

Some miners rely on the 0.8 version of the program and others haven't made the switch yet and rely on the older version

There was a bug in the 0.7 version and

At the same time

0.7 answered: ""Only over my grave! THIS is the correct version"". 

And voilà

**How was the problem solved?**

There must only be one unified blockchain

Due to the bug

As you can remember

Finally

**What did this mean for regular users?**

Nothing. Almost.

A regular user making a transaction during that time would broadcast his transaction to both ledgers and it would be included in both. Obviously one would be abandoned sooner or later

Also, as all clients would accept the eventual resulting ledger.

As you can see

**What's a double-spend?**

This is the reason why some merchants and exchanges stopped processing incoming bitcoins for a couple of hours. 

The bitcoin network prevents people from spending the same coins by mantaining this unique ledger

With some luck, have the transaction confirmed on the 0.7 ledger. 

What happens is that

*This is not something easy to do and requires a lot of luck* because the blocks mined (the pages added to the ledger) must be mined precisely in the correct order. But still

Now the situation has resolved and the blockchain keeps growing happily

As you can see

But the thing is

But this is where Bitcoin is very different. YOU DIRECTLY have the opportunity to influence the value of your investment.  As has been pointed out before, the more people using and benefiting from bitcoins, the more technologies built on Bitcoin; all of these add trust and value to Bitcoin. 

If you're a programmer, convince your FED-hating  gold hording friends of the unique properties of bitcoins as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. If you're an internet user (going out on a limb here) convince the companies you buy things from to accept bitcoins. And if you are just a general user, get educated and tell your friends and family why this could very well end up being a huge and disruptive technology that benefits everyone.

Those in the &lt; $3, so I could imagine the process taking the same amount of time now (and maybe longer since hundreds of customers are re-submitting their documents all at the same time). I don't believe Bitfloor has a large staff doing this manual processing the way that MtGox does, so I don't expect Bitfloor can get through thousands of verifications a day like they do.

Likewise, say, half of all Bitfloor users, IAFCU may have already received a couple hundred new applications in the last few days, each of which requires a telephone confirmation step (and possibly even a confirmation of a donation sent to a local charity). So I won't be surprised if it takes a few more days for IAFCU applications to get processed.

I know it's frustrating that it's taking so long. But I still think our best bet continues to be patience.

_Here's the email response I received from Internet Credit Union after I submitted my account application:_

Dear AudenX

Ok so you have submitted your application for a new Account- If I were you I would saying:  Now What?

**First Step**

The next business day a real person in the good ole US of A will review what you sent and perhaps wonder why you forgot some information we really need.

**Second Step**

This real person (maybe even me) will call and verify you are really you.  So please pick up the phone or at least call us back.  

When we call

1. We are required to “Know our customers”.   This means that personal touch of actually speaking with you and verifying some of the information on your application.

2. We will give your account number .  If you want a really cool account number you can request one by donating either dollars or bitcoins.   Hey we are a not for profit and need to keep fees down for everyone.  Accounts numbers from 100-9

3. We will ask you if you want to set up A2A transfer from another financial institution.   Then you can transfer money from one those big banks that helped bring down the economy just a few years ago to us little but good guys that care about your financial well being.

**Third Step – Sign onto online banking:**

READ THIS

Log on now the day we call you and we mean today:

You need to log on with 24 hours of us creating your account and contacting you otherwise we will have to reset your PW.  And why take up your time on long call with us when you could be out there saving the world.  

**How do I log on?:**

We encourage people to jump from our home page: IAFCU.ORG.   Also then you can read my old and new blogs and make my dad happy.

**What do I do if its my first time?:**

Mainly answer the phone!   Part of being with a Credit Union is that we like to get to know our members and we will personally call you and walk you through how to get on and navigate online banking.

**Name that Account:**

Once on you may want to go to Nick Names Under XXX and change the names of your accounts.  Primary Share is called a Savings Account in the banking world and Share Draft is checking account.  Yup we can help you with that.

THANKS FOR JOINING AND BECOMING AN OWNER OF THE CREDIT UNION

_/u/df546rtghr65y4 asked an important question:_

_**So how is it that the IAFCU is able to issue accounts to people outside NJ?**_

Very good question.

This may seem weird to some customers who are new to [credit unions (Wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union), the field of membership is those who live or worship in New Brunswick, NJ. _However_, IAFCU can satisfy the field of membership requirement for those outside New Brunswick if they make a small donation to a New Brunswick-based nonprofit.

So for those who (like me) are opening an IAFCU account but reside outside of New Brunswick

&gt; Please note that if you live outside New Brunswick NJ the only other requirement is donate $5 (usually we ask $10 but understand circumstances) to a local charity.  There are four who are bitcoin friendly and worthy the one we deal with the most is [Elijah's Promise](http://www.elijahspromise.org/) they are a soup kitchen-food pantry and a lot more.  They have no relation to us and it is tax deductible.  We can tell you about the others when we call you.

Although this might seem like a hassle to some, and the $2.50 processing fee + $5 donation is hardly a loss compared to what we were fearing might happen (e.g. 25-50% loss through a class-action lawsuit).

With the recent Bitcoin “bubble” fiasco and the subsequent rise and fall of Bitcoin value

(OK


Let's discuss my favorite attribute of the Bitcoin protocol: anonymity.

Many noobs getting into the Bitcoin game fail to realize that anonymity is an important key to understanding the importance of Bitcoin. In places where your wealth can easily be taking away from you (see Cyprus, the USA and others), Bitcoin can function like a store of cash buried in a dessert in the middle of nowhere – buried so deep that nobody can find it, not even the most powerful men and women on Earth. 

**POINT:** *If you are purchasing your Bitcoins through services like Coinbase or Mt. Gox, and although it's difficult, it's certainly not impossible for those with the knowhow to find you and prosecute you. See [this link](http://decryptedmatrix.com/live/an-analysis-of-anonymity-in-the-bitcoin-system) before continuing.* 

Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous. You must take steps to protect yourself in order to keep your identity a secret. And even still, I offer this guide as a way to accomplish secret purchases and covert trades. Of course I cannot guarantee you won't end up in jail. At the end of the day, nobody knows how closely governments are tracking BTC purchases over the TOR network. Some people even believe that the TOR network was created by nefarious forces. I doubt it, but you never really know. 

**STEP ONE: Anonymous Hardware**

Because you cannot *really* know whether or not you are being watched

**STEP TWO: Anonymous Software**

~~If you don't know how to download a Linux LiveCD

It's arguable which software you should use, leave no trace on the computer you're using, and to use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, email and instant messaging. 

**ProTip:** For an extra layer of protection

DO NOT CONNECT TO THE NETWORK FROM YOUR HOME.

I repeat, you don't want to practice on your home Wifi, which you probably pay for with a bank account or credit card. 

After you've spent a day or two using TAILS and familiarizing yourself with the LinuxOS, boot up the LiveCD, and connect. Browse the TOR network and triple-check that you are protected. You can do this by [checking your IP address for DNS LEAKS](http://www.dnsleaktest.com/). Only if you feel comfortably hidden from prying eyes will you want to continue.

**STEP THREE: Creating an Anonymous Wallet**

There are [several different ways to to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b9p8d/how_unsafe_is_it_to_use_bitaddressorg_to_generate/)

1. Save bitaddress.org.html to your computer
2. Close browser.
3. Disable computer Wi-Fi.
4. Open bitaddress.org.html in browser. 
5. Generate an address and record the private keys.
6. Close the browser window.
7. Go home. Think about what you are about to do.

**STEP FOUR: Funding the Anonymous Wallet**

Funding your wallet will be the most difficult part of this process. Obviously you don't want to go to a site like Coinbase or Mt. Gox and link up you bank account

Probably the best way to get coins is to know someone who is willing to send you a few

My suggestion is to make cash deposits through ZipZap or Bitinstant, over the TOR network, from a site like Hotmail or Yahoo, which doesn't require a phone number to sign up – I'm looking at you Gmail. Make sure your new account  forwards your email to yet another account, perhaps Tormail or a temp address. You probably won't need to use the email more than once anyway, for confirmation, if you need it. And you might want to create a new address with every deposit, you are caught on camera. Maybe offer a homeless man some money to make the deposit for you. And hope he doesn't just pocket your money. Regardless

If you absolutely must make deposits from your bank account

Another great idea is to use the [localbitcoins website](http://localbitcoins.com/); meet with a seller locally; pay cash and GTFO.

   
**STEP FOUR: Spending from the Anonymous Wallet**

 If you are looking to CASH OUT, it's about spending your coins.

To buy things, download a lite client like Electrum and access your account. Every time you want to spend, you will have to re-download, but it should not take more than a few minutes. And though you are probably safe enough to spend directly from the client, if you really want to be safe you should send the funds to a second wallet though a mixing service, then to a third or fourth or fifth wallet, also through mixing services. These “Mixing Wallets” should NOT be created using the TOR network because the TOR exit node may be monitored. I've never had a problem myself

To created the mixing wallets you will also need a way to hide your identify without using TOR. The best way to do this is to sign up for a VPN service though a public WiFi hotspot and then pay in Bitcoin. The best service I have found is called [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/). You can access their service through a public computer, you now can safely create mixing wallets without exposing your password to the open network. Make sure that after you mix the coins you send them all to a safe, final address, which will be your Spending Wallet. 

Remaining anonymous will cost your some time and money. With each transaction you're going to have to pay for mixing

**REMEMBER** Your Spending Wallet should not contain all of your funds. The bulk of your coins should be address you created using bitaddress. Never trust an online service to hold the bulk of your funds. The recent hacks have shown that the best place to store your private key is in your head.

**Final Notes:**

The Bitcoin protocol itself is not anonymous. And theoretically it's possible to trace every transaction back to you. This is why you need to use fake emails, the FEDS will have a hell of a time tracking multiple address though VPN tunneling back to a cold storage wallet that you created offline and only use to send coins over TOR. There are just too many roadblocks. Of course nothing is impossible. But I sleep very good at night knowing that my door is not going to be kicked in by the Men in Black. And even if you're not doing anything illegal, this sort of behavior is certainly suspicious.

If you were lucky enough to receive a tip from Reddit's own /u/bitcoinbillionaire (I myself was not) and you haven't cashed out. Create a VPN-tunneled throwaway account and tip yourself before claiming your coins. Then send them through a mixing service and to your cold storage address. Now you're on your way to being an anonymous spender. 

I hope this guide helps. I really do. **The purpose of Bitcoin isn't to make money. It's to protect the money that you already have

In typical use, the paper wallet is empty, this is due to the way to the way that the client handles change. 

Lets explore this with an example.

--------

Let's imagine that I send the full contents of my paper wallet (5BTC) to a new address


    +-------+
    | paper |
    +-------+
        |
        | 
        |
        V
    +--------------------+   
    | destination (5BTC) |    
    +--------------------+   



This is the expected behaviour

This time


    +-------+
    | paper |
    +-------+
        |
        +------------------------+
        |                        |
        V                        V
    +--------------------+    +---------------+
    | destination (1BTC) |    | change (4BTC) |
    +--------------------+    +---------------+

Unfortunately this isn't how bitcoin works. There is now nothing in my paper wallet


The mistake people have made in the past is to import a paper wallet with 100BTC in it

----------

This situation is *only* an issue if you reimport a wallet and expect the funds to remain on it. This issue doesn't apply if you are using your wallet normally. 

----------

Hope this saves people some serious hassle

1364398843.0,1b454a,I asked VALVE if they would consider accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.,cyborgcommando0,231,49,81,"I submitted a ticket through Valve's Support System ([proof](http://i.imgur.com/wpSCLJy.jpg)) asking if they would consider using Bitcoin as a payment method for games and such on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com).

Here is the transcribed ticket:

---

Hello
I was not sure where to address this concern so I did the best I could in selecting the right categories for my question.

I was wondering if Steam would look into accepting Bitcoin as an additional payment option for Games

I'm not a salesman

Bitcoins have been steadily gaining popularity and value. There is a slight learning curve but when you grasp the inner working of Bitcoin you can see why it is gaining acceptance by merchants and users alike.

Bitcoin is an online

There is a lot more to it but I will live it up to your organization to decide how and when is best to accept Bitcoin. If you could escalate this ticket or pass it on upwards I (and many others) would appreciate your consideration.

Thanks!

---

I am pretty excited to see if VALVE would consider adopting Bitcoin as a payment method. I think that would *really* send ripples throughout the gaming world and stimulate the Bitcoin economy.

I will update this with their responses if there are any. 

**EDIT 1:** Due to popular demand I have also emailed the man himself... Gabe. Waiting for a response.

The bank said this company is involved in bitcoin trading and asked if I used the money to buy bitcoins.  Again

Finally they asked if I was involved in buying and selling any virtual currency

What the hell is going on?

EDIT-

After gathering my wits and reading opinions here I went back to the bank.  

First off

My plan was to sit with the branch manager and answer the questions (since he knew the answers anyway) and then find out why I was being questioned.  If things went poorly I planned on asking why I should keep my money at the bank instead of choosing a better one.  None of this happened.

Instead

She pulled out a pad of paper where she had written my responses and explained that her district manager had asked her to make the inquiries about my account.  She said the branch manager was on vacation this week.  When I asked if the branch manager usually does this kind of stuff she said yes

I can see the email she had received from her supervisor on her computer screen and saw that he had a number of things for her to do.  One of them was to question me.  I volunteered to help her answer the email so she looks good to the new boss.  She agreed.  We read the email together.

Turns out the guy researched Mtgox on his own and became curious about bitcoins.  The way he had worded his email was not threatening but more like he was on a quest for more information.  The final question he wrote his banker was to find out what I thought about bitcoins in general.  There was also some nonsense about me withdrawing a lot of money in cash which didn't happen

I got to proofread her email as she typed a response to the regional.  I followed evoorhees's advice and said I bought them as a one time investment and did not plan on doing it again.  The personal banker said in the email that I would love to speak with the boss personally and gave him my number.  I left the bank feeling 10 pounds lighter.

**BTC-E.com**

To pay into this exchange

Now either wire money, Unistream) to fund your account or find an Okpay exchanger somewhere. Or Ukash/CashU. Just because contact-sys is Russian doesn't mean there aren't sending points in every country in the world. 

BTC-E codes you buy on #bitcoin-otc from verified gpg authenticated traders with good ratings

Perfect Money is a shady HYIP digital currency run by Russians much like Liberty Reserve. You sign up for free

You can also obviously dump Litecoins you bought on Vircurex to fund the account

**Bitfloor.com**

Fastest way to deposit is through CapitalOne P2P or cash deposit
https://bitfloor.com/docs/#funding-deposit

Be aware Bitfloor is insolvent due to owing 25k bitcoins that were stolen last year but they have a repayment schedule that may or may not bankrupt them. Use at own risk but most ppl trade there everyday with no problems.

**Bitstamp.net**

Great exchange in Slovakia? I think. You have to pay with Euro SEPA wire, convert to EUR and send SEPA for you if you request it. If they don't then check with Bitstamp what a SWIFT wire costs (probably nothing, I think they use Latvian banks that charge no receiving fees). If you want a bank account in Latvia then sign up here: http://www.rietumu.com/ if you have a local corporation or business where you live you can, maybe a personal account too. You can always incorporate a dirt cheap Delaware LLC or Oregon LLC from anywhere in the world and use it to open up worldwide bank accounts.

**Bitcoin-24.com**

Takes direct wires
You can also use Liqpay if you have a USD or EUR card. Sign up to liqpay.com, so pointless to load anymore money. Liqpay may also call you to verify card details this is normal. Liqpay is meant for Russians and CIS countries to use like Ukraine so due to epic fraud of credit cards don't expect to load too much this way unless you find a Liqpay exchanger, but what's the point when you can just wire money to bitcoin-24 anyways. 

**Vircurex.com**

Good exchange
They only accept BTC
https://www.aurumxchange.com/ or from somebody on Bitcointalk

**Cavirtex.com**

Can only fund if in Canada

**LibertyBit.com**

https://www.libertybit.com/funding various easy methods

**Bitcoin China**

https://btcchina.com/ fast growing exchange

Check english forums to see if anybody exchanging Alipay or taking wires.

**CampBX.com**

Accepts money orders

**Bitcoin-central.net**

Just had a major outage due to instawallet hack

**VirWoX.com**

You can pay with Paypal to get Second Life ""Linden Dollars"" then convert to BTC

**Or course there's all the fixed price exchangers**

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0 for everything from Moneypak to Skrill. You can also risk buying coins on Silk Road with moneypak

The more Bitcoin appreciates in value, but it attracts people to Bitcoin who probably shouldn't be into Bitcoin. Those people being Wall Streeter types, who tend to get into things purely to profit from them. They will unquestionably be quick to jump ship at the first sign of any existential threat to Bitcoin.

The US Government in particular is believed to be *the* biggest threat to Bitcoin, the higher is the chance that Bitcoin itself doesn't survive an existential State sponsored threat.

*Take-Away*: Don't talk about the price, but that's a good thing. It creates a more stable base of enthusiastic Bitcoin users over the long term.

That said, is how easy it is for us to get caught up in the success. It's easy to forget how vulnerable this success is, or how quickly markets can change direction.

The window of opportunity for making major strides with Bitcoin is wide open to everyone right now; but it will only stay this open for a very short period of time. That means

*Stop celebrating your success.*

To prepare for this day

The beauty of Bitcoin is that, if your idea is in fact world changing, you still make a world-changing amount of money. The dynamics of the Bitcoin economy inherently encourage anonymous, open source collaboration on commercial development projects.

Bitcoin is completely different from most other industries in this regard. Because in the Bitcoin economy, and boost the exchange rate. Therefore, you can profit indirectly off of ANY success, even stolen success.

It bothers me that more developers don't recognize this, trapped inside the consciousness of a single entity until they inevitably perish.

How incredibly unfortunate it is that these ideas aren't released in full, or otherwise tossed out by the community. Regardless, openness in Bitcoin entrepreneuriship would exponentially enhance the creative process, which is what the Bitcoin economy needs to make leaps of progress, right now.

We *need* your ideas to be public

To encourage this style of development, starting with hard disk encryption and graduating to anonymous communications.

The information will be dense.

My motivation is that I wish more people would take advantage of anonymity and the unique properties of Bitcoin to skip the secrecy and bullshit. We need to lose the facade of secrecy if Bitcoin is to rapidly take off in a big way

If you're sitting on the idea of the century, you should want it to succeed at all costs; including the cost of having it taken from you. This is because the larger Bitcoin economy needs your idea to succeed to survive the coming existential threats. (see my previous posts). Even if your idea is stolen from you, your BTC stash will markedly appreciate in value anyway, and Bitcoin will rise. It's a win-win for the entire planet.

If you secure your account with Google Authenticator

Here is the step-by-step for dummies:

1. MtGox -&gt; Security Center -&gt; Software Authenticators -&gt; Add New -&gt; you will see a bar code
2. On your Smart Phone
3. In Google Authenticator -&gt; hit ""+"" to add a new authenticator -&gt; ""Scan Barcode"" -&gt; Scan MtGox's bar code
4. Back up either the bar code or the private key for the case you lose your smart phone.
5. Enter the MtGox number you see in your smart phone into the field in your browser
6. Drag this authenticator into Withdrawal AND ""Security Center"" (or even Login if you want to)

Done!

**EDIT**

reimeuk just pointed out that if an attacker can log in, it should be mandatory!

**EDIT 2**

Roujo pointed out you can also set the Authenticator for ""Security Center"" which makes it so the settings can't be changed without the Authenticator

It’s related to the issue of change going to a different address that has been in contention lately


I managed to get my coins back today


The cause of the missing coins was because I was making payments from the same wallet on two computers while they were syncing with the block chain. For whatever reason
I had tried many times to load different wallets and rescan the blockchain again and again and never had any luck. In the end I had a mess of different wallet files


Well after the price went over $100 I figured I would have another crack at it and took a different approach to see if I could recover the coins.


I installed [pywallet]( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34028.0) and did a dump of each wallet file that I had. I have never deleted a wallet file and this is what saved me.


I searched the dumped wallet files and in one of the files I found the address I was looking for! I assumed I must have missed this wallet so I loaded up Bitcoin with the relevant wallet and let it sync…. 


I was disappointed; the transactions as they loaded did not contain the change I had expected. But I had seen it in the dump of the wallet.dat it must be there!


I ran the following command within the Bitcoin console after unlocking the wallet.


    Dumpprivkey  &lt;bitcoin address&gt;


My heart skipped a beat

I then imported this key to a blockchain.info wallet using the import feature and my balance adjusted! I had recovered my missing Bitcoins! I then transferred them to my new secure wallet and the transaction confirmed


Here are some things I have learned that should probably be common knowledge for anyone using Bitcoin.


 * Keep a backup

 * Be aware that a transaction can result in change that will go to a newly created address in your wallet.dat.

 * Encrypting your wallet will reset the 100 pre-generated addresses that are used for change and new addresses.
 * Don’t make transactions while waiting for the blockchain to sync.

 * If a wallet for some reason does not contain an expected transaction or address dump the data with [pywallet]( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34028.0) and search for any relevant information.

Keep your Bitcoins safe everyone!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Thylmann

Fabian Thylmann is the owner of some of the world’s most heavily used pornography websites (YouPorn, etc), via his company Manwin, which has its headquarters in Luxembourg and offices in Hamburg, London, Los Angeles, Nicosia and Montreal. Combined

Little is known of the reclusive Thylmann, lives in Belgium, is married with two children and is a computer programmer. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s when he developed software called NATS (Next-generation Affiliate Tracking Software), which linked up the vast number of internet pornography sites for the first time and enabled visitors to select sex films according to personal preference.

He has only ever given one press interview, we want to create as many opportunities as possible for people to spend money."" He has not spoken publicly since.

Germany's Focus magazine claimed that he has revolutionised the business of pornography consumption by allowing the free viewing of pornographic video clips

Today I received a request to discuss it with the head of product for our division.  I'm not sure if this will be tomorrow, where things are, and where things need to go.

I'm thinking given our industry and position, of course I'll be ready for both.  Thoughts? 

Key points I'd like to make is that for our Merchants

* They do not need to worry about charge backs.
 
* Even with volatility as it is today

* Lower fees for our merchants allowing them to grow more quickly.

* They can offer discounts to draw more sales in.
 
In terms of how we can continue to earn money given that we'd be charging lower fees for these transactions

* Bitcoin is in need of someone to develop a secure online wallet that merchants can trust to keep funds in if they wish to maintain sales in Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin can benefit from someone creating a trusted escrow service for larger transactions. (Counter to no chargebacks

* We're adding value to the merchant by giving them the ability to integrate with one provider

What do people think? Where else could I take the discussion?  I'll be going over the myth list so I can be prepared to dispel them.  

I'm not sure how long I'll have so the more prepared the better things will go!

I've seen an increasing amount of people who think that saving (or ""hoarding"") is somehow bad for bitcoin.  I'd like to take a moment to dispel this myth.

It's important to remember that saving *is* spending.  This may sound paradoxical

Saving is deferred spending.  Nobody is buying bitcoin with the intent of setting fire to their computer.  Saving is also spending in the present.  People who hold bitcoin and opt not to use them are spending an opportunity cost to consume in the moment in hopes for a greater ability to spend in the future.  This is perfectly normal when the price of bitcoin is increasing so rapidly.  Any attempt to dissuade people of this is utterly futile.  

This leads me to my next point.  How does a market based on bitcoin work?  If one were to peruse reddit

If you believe this is an appropriate way to organize an economy

It's important to understand that bitcoin will reach a market equilibrium.  The price *will* stabilize eventually.  At that point

Those who insist on berating people into acting against their own rational self interest are only displaying 1) that they do not respect the rightful decisions of others to use their property as they see fit; and 2) that they do not understand the fundamentals of an economy.  

Lastly

It was a crazy thing that rich kid's dads might have to do ""Lotus 1-2-3"" on

Yeah, and it didn't have a fucking COMPUTER IN IT that could also show you PORNOGRAPHY.

My point is: Year after year, and I never saw it coming, and NOT ONCE WAS IT JUST A FAD. Not once did it go away. I can't think of any cool, never seen before ""WHOAAA, BRO"" thing that actually failed. Not once.

Specifics may change - ""reading messages on a BBS"" became ""reading usenet"" became ""reading reddit""

OF COURSE BITCOINS ARE THE NEXT BIG THING.

Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. ""THE POST OFFICE IS GOING TO TAX EMAILS LOL"" remember that?

No

Do you really think, Wii points, Amazon coins, etc? Yeah, sure. Just like how people still use Prodigy and compuserve.

So I just convinced a local clinic here in Pensacola to take Bitcoin. 

Not convert BTC into fiat and then pay them. *Actually pay them directly with coin.*

This is great for Sean's Outpost and the homeless people we serve because health care for them is sparse. The ER's here are fickle to say the least, the medication cause an allergic reaction, and then the ER refuse to see that patient again because they consider it ""follow up care"". 

Its a nightmare.

Thanks to the generous donations of the Bitcoin community, into see a doctor. 

By no stretch of the imagination this is Bitcoins being used to *save* lives.

And that is awesome. Really awesome. That clinic is really going to help the homeless here. And Bitcoin is helping to make that happen.

What I didn't realize until talking to the Doctors at that clinic was how much Bitcoin can actually help that clinic. And apparently

Bitcoin can fix the cash flow problems that are plaguing most doctor's offices. Apparently

The clinic was already giving a cash discount. Because cash helps keep them in business. They are treating Bitcoin like cash

I'm still wrapping my mind around the implications Bitcoin can make in this area. I think this is low hanging fruit for the Bitcoin community. Know a Doctor? Talk to them about Bitcoin. You are a Doctor? Take Bitcoin. If you're an entrepreneur start a medical services business...that takes bitcoin. 

Health care in this country is a catastrophe. And that's probably doing catastrophes a disservice. 

How can we leverage Bitcoin to help fix that?

There was a great post on the frontpage of r/bitcoin today that had this comment in it...

Can we start talking about how we could leverage Bitcoin to really disrupt the healthcare industry?

Unlike traditional payment systems such as VISA and Paypal where fees are enforced by a central authority

**It is NOT developers who decide the fee**

Unfortunately, *you have a voice and a vote.*

--------------

**How does it work?**

Fees work in a similar way to the Bitcoin market price. Ther are two forces that oppose each other and will balance on an equilibrium: users and miners.

Right now many miners don't accept anything less than 0.0005 which was the standard fee many months ago. Miners certainly don't have any incentive to lower the fees unless users start sending out transactions with lower fees. 

If every Bitcoin user, miners would be pressured to accept this as the new standard as they would lose a significant amount of money by not accepting them. 

Miners will never have an incentive to accept 0 fee transactions

**You choose what you believe is fair**

The idea is that you open your Bitcoin program's settings / Adjustments and set a fee that you believe should become the new standard. *This is how you vote.*

Bitcoin users are voting with each and every transaction. Keeping the fee at 0.0005 is a vote in favour of that fee

The idea is that the community of users will reach a consensus. Obviously this consensus is much easier reached if people speak up. Right now there is no website to do this

**Speak your mind reddit!**

Tell other users what you think the new standard fee should be and vote accordingly. To facilitate this task I have created [**This Poll**](http://poll.pollcode.com/ixs91) where you can vote and view the votes of others. 

-------------

**Last notes on miners and transaction fees**

Currently

While the Bitcoin price is free to go up, because its value is similar to the value we had last January.

Here's why it's important:

Bitcoin is a new way to to pay for products and services. 
It brings many advantages for customers and suppliers but its path to mainstream use is very slow and difficult. 
Google is a company who has showed to be ahead in granting to its users astonishing advantages with bleeding hedge open technology. Its support would mean the beginning of the real wide spread adoption of the virtual currency. 
Many are the risks and the drawbacks but also the adoption of the Internet had theirs in the early days and even if many of them have remained unchanged we are glad to be on it.

1367701652.0,1dp4c4,Why The US Government Have Likely Already Approved Bitcoin,JuliusPragatan,178,36,132,"Hey Reddit


**The Elephant in the Room**

Bitcoin is an enigma.  It has renowned economists like Paul Krugman entirely perplexed whilst Silicon Valley CEO's are falling over one another to get a piece of the action.  The headlines change on a daily basis: “It's A Ponzi Scheme!”, “It's The New Internet!”.  

As a result of these, swinging wildly to the slightest bit of news, good or bad.  

Of course

Government officials have been oddly quiet in addressing this question.  Aside from some rudimentary FINCEN guidelines and a vague ECB report

Whilst I can't provide any definitive proof as to what decisions have and are being made behind closed government doors

**Satoshi's Lament**

Back in December 2010 Satoshi was involved in a heated discussion amongst Bitcoin developers on BitcoinTalk as to whether they should support Julian Assange by offering Bitcoin as a means to bypass the notorious banking blockade that had rendered Wikileaks' cash reserves impotent.  Bitcoin's creator

“No

By 'destroy us', at that point in time they could have easily compromised the project by purchasing enough computing power to overrun the network (known as a 51% attack).

Despite Satoshi's protestations, just 4 months later in April 2011, Gavin Andresen (now lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation) announced that the C.I.A. had contacted him.

“I'm going to give a [presentation](http://www.Bitcointrading.com/pdf/GavinAndresenCIATalk.pdf) about Bitcoin at the C.I.A headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference...I accepted the invitation to speak because the fact that I was invited means Bitcoin is already on their radar

Satoshi disappeared shortly after.

Gavin recently spoke to the New Yorker about the event.
""...I think people realized once I got invited to speak at the C.I.A. that there was no kind of hiding. They
[Source: http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/04/the-future-of-Bitcoin.html] 

**The Silk Road Goes Live**

2011 also saw the release of the notorious 'Ebay for Drugs' website, client downloads and trading volume began to skyrocket after its inception.
[Source: http://gizmodo.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable]

A week after the Gawker article, including heroin, cocaine, and meth, and users sell by hiding their identities through a program that makes them virtually untraceable...[it's] the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen. It's more brazen than anything else by lightyears."" he told the assembled press.

As an aside, the TOR Project claims that over 80% of its funding in 2012 came directly from the U.S Government [Source: Tor Project Annual Report 2012]

**The Radar Screen Lights Up**

Suddenly

The C.I.A, and the illegal activities it was funding via Silk Road and other places would have done nothing but confound their concerns (or so you would think).  They must have also known (just as Satoshi did) that if there was ever an opportunity to kill Bitcoin (either with regulation, criminal proceedings and/or a 51% attack) then it was back then, in 2011, with the network still in its infancy, that they should strike.  

We should have expected the kind of domain seizures that we saw with the likes of Megaupload; Bitcointalk

And yet

**Eric

Back in 2010 Google dipped their toes into the world of virtual currencies, Facebook may have also faced increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny.

In June 2011

Also in attendance at the meeting was Jared Cohen, Director of Speechwriting for Ambassador Susan Rice at the US State Department and current Communications Director of the International Crisis Group, and Lisa Shields, Vice President of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Here's an excerpt:

**JA:** ...there’s also a very nice little paper that I’ve seen in relation to Bitcoin

**ES:** No.

**JA:** Okay

…

**JA:** And very important, untraceable etc. People have been experimenting with over the past 20 years. The Bitcoin actually has the balance and incentives right, and that is why it is starting to take off. The different combination of these things. No central nodes. It is all point to point. One does not need to trust any central mint….

...

**ES:** That's very interesting


So, thanks to Julian, the CEO of Google was now beginning to get an inkling as to its disruptive potential.

Just 13 days prior to the Assange meet

Topics of discussion included:

* Emerging Economies: Roles and Responsibilities
* Economic and National Security in a Digital Age
* Technological Innovation in Western Economies: Stagnation or Promise?
* Imbalances

Some of the 2011/12 attendees included: 

* Josef Ackermann (Chairman of Deutsche Bank)
* Jean-Claude Trichet (President of the European Central Bank)
* Chris Hughes (Co-Founder of Facebook)
* Reid Hoffman (CEO of Linkedin)
* Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon)

To see so many tech luminaries in attendance at Bilderberg is indicative of the kind of power and respect that geeks and hackers now command in shaping the world stage.  Just how many high-level decisions are being influenced by this new technorati is hard to say, united through technology on a global scale – not governments – are dictating the speed of change.

**Joining The Dots**

None of this means that bitcoins ride is going to be friction-free - just because Eric Schmidt is open to the idea of bitcoin displacing traditional currencies (as he and Jared Cohen alluded to in a recent CNBC interview)

However

It suggests to me that any nefarious corporations that attempt to shutdown bitcoin because of a perceived threat to their business model

Indeed

And perhaps, like TOR, was also developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory.

Though I prefer to think it was just some lone genius sitting in his attic who accidentally changed the world.

* Wed. 11:50am - Groceries arrive at my front door

Total turnaround time: ~36 hours.
___
**Pros:**

* All communication from Bitspend was impressively prompt.
* I got to order groceries with bitcoin (duh!)
* Bitspend normally asks for full confirmation of payment before proceeding with order. They offered to proceed after just 1 confirmation for my order since the requested delivery time was imminent.

**Cons:**

* Invoices received from Bitspend were often missing relevant information. I always had the information I needed to complete my part of the order process, the order total (in $), MWG service charge (in $), Bitspend service charge (in $), and requested payment amount (in BTC) were all listed, but there was no subtotal (in $) listed, and no listed quote of MTGox weighted average (which was used to convert $ to BTC). Obviously I could figure this out with simple arithmetic
* Requested payment amounts were quoted to 10^-15 BTC, and I asked Bitspend what was the appropriate way to truncate the amount, but I'm still not clear on what is expected. Requested payment amounts should simply be presented to the user with no more than 8 decimal places to avoid ambiguity.
* I included some produce in my order, while the amount Bitspend paid to MWG appears to reflect the amount that was actually delivered. Overall the price I paid to Bitspend was $1.15 too high for the amount of produce I received. I imagine this could swing in the user's favor at some point if the initial price were an underestimate (instead of the overestimate I paid). It would be nice if the price I pay accurately reflects the delivered products' price, but I'm not really sweating the difference. (This seems to be an issue with MWG itself, rather than Bitspend. See edit 1 below.)
* Including MWG fees ($4.95), I could have saved $8.60 if I went to the store in person. Actually, I was charged no taxes in this transaction, and I may have been charged 5.5% sales tax on some of these items if I purchased them in person, so maybe the fees are not that bad.
* Just about every time I sent an email to Bitspend
* Having to request a new destination address and MTGox quote if I don't pay within 30 minutes of receipt of the invoice is somewhat irritating. Bitspend told me that this process will be automated soon though
* Bitspend's website indicates a 10-item limit for orders of $50-100. My order was in this price range, so I'm not sure if the item limit was waived, or does not apply to an itemized grocery list. I'm not sure if this belongs as a ""con"" or a ""pro"" or as a ""I'm confused by their website still"". Some clarification would be nice.

**Overall impressions**

I was generally very happy to be able to spend my coins on groceries

**edit 1:** I received a response regarding the price estimation issue and email spam:

the red blob on the right side shows there is plenty of activity currently across the whole board

As much as it sucks to see such a massive heist

With Bitcoin transactions being non-reversable Bitcoin exchanges should probably be even slower at releasing funds than existing banks/exchanges.  Multiple exchanges should spring up to cater to different the different needs and acceptable risk level of traders

Bitcoin white paper.. http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
section 7 last paragraph.

There has been a lot of talk lately about changing bitcoin protocol and doing away with asics.  I hope others will join me and speak out against this idea. 

Part of the idea behind bitcoin is that the rules were defined before it was started.  An entire industry has sprung up around this idea and millions have been invested.  Changing the proof of work would essentially alienate the entire mining community and what more, I for one would be done with bitcoin and would in my mind be dead.  How can I trust something where the rules can be changed at any time.  

Am I the only one here?  Discuss. ",self,t5_2s3qj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fe2h5/satoshi_not_only_forsaw_the_51_attack_but_said/

Let's get organised! In line with Gavin's ""Don't wait for permission"" philosophy, but there's no real network in Australia, or at least Sydney. (Seems Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane have meetups)

I attended the conference the other week and came away with a few easy things that would really help ground the Australian community

1. There isn't a **Sydney meetup**! Anyone fancy fixing that with me?

1. Lindsay suggested that if anyone is interested in starting **local chapters of the Bitcoin Foundation** they should get in contact. I've already sent her an email and she's forwarded that through to Jon who's managing the Chapter stuff. He's not gotten back to me yet

1. I spoke with Josh Rossi about **Satoshi Square** - a public Bitcoin outcry exchange, but if people would like to organise one in other cities I suggest you mention where you're located in the comments so each mob can get acquainted.

1. I'd love to get a **Cryptocoin pegged to the AUD** distributed. This works on two levels: it gets the usefulness of cryptocoins out there, really); and I think the potential gains outway the risk.

1. Got an idea? Add it in the comments and I'll edit it in.

Cheers

**Bitcoin is not even close to ready for use by the general public. The problem is not a lack of exposure. The problem is that it's a pain in the ass.**

I mean no offense to the developers working on the client. I'm a web developer myself

For the sake of making this discussion easier

- *Developers* are the folks working on the client itself
- *Nerds* are folks like you and I
- *Users* are normal people, not easy-after-I-spent-2-weeks-learning-it easy. If something is difficult, they will stop using it. Nerds have a strong tendency to look down upon Users, because we're anti-social and kind of jerks and because Users are great at pointing out when a system that we spent hours building has a stupid flaw that makes it utterly baffling to use for anyone who didn't build it.

Developers are building Bitcoin for Nerds right now, this bubble that everyone keeps talking about is going to burst and instead of being left with an inflated currency but a thriving, stable economy, we'll have a bunch of Nerds who spent a lot of time day-trading and never actually buying anything. Bitcoin needs sellers of goods and services in order to thrive, sellers can't thrive without buyers, and we *need* Users to buy. There aren't enough of us Nerds alone. There has to be growth.

So

http://mlkshk.com/r/35UI

Here's what I think needs to change.

1. This Address Book hijacks the common usage of the phrase - that is, unanswered questions: Why do I have multiple addresses? Which one should I keep my money in? I didn't create this address, why is it here?

I'd recommend obscuring the multiple address concept as much as possible. The creation of a new address when sending bitcoins is a clever anonymizing tactic

(Side note: if one wanted to determine where someone had sent bitcoins, one shows up on the EFF's website, and the other is brand new. Seems sort of frivolous to me.)

2. Calling this ""Your Bitcoin Address"" implies that the User has one address. ""This is *your* address"". In reality, at least, but I'd again recommend obscuring the concept as much as possible for the sake of preventing confusion.

3. The balance is, and the current balance displayed in larger text above the Credit column. This would create a visual flow between where a user is now in terms of bitcoin balance, and how they got there.

4. For about a week in to learning Bitcoin, replace your current (singular) address with a new address, theoretically wiping out your old one. The button copy needs to be improved, to better explain what is really going on. ""Create Additional Address"", ""Add Address"", something like that. Less new/replacing, more creating/adding.

5. Why can't I just highlight the address and copy it with Command/Ctrl-C? Visually

6. This doesn't belong at the beginning of the table. Confirmation count is only useful to determine whether or not a transaction is valid

7. Hid this for the sake of protecting my privacy, no indication of the time zone used. There are a number of little quirks like this in the UI. Individually, they're just picked nits, but combined they create enough cognitive stress to make an interface ""difficult"". It just doesn't feel good.

8. Listing the address that received the transaction is silly. Of course I received it with that address

9. If you're going to use plus signs

10. I'm twelve years old and what is this. Or if you'd prefer, but that should be displayed as a binary Connected/Not Connected indicator (red/yellow/green light?) or not at all. Block count isn't important for a User to know unless they explicitly want details on the system's status, which should be buried in a menu somewhere. Transactions count should be with the transactions themselves.

So that's a short list. I didn't even get in to the concept of the ambiguous delay when receiving bitcoins, but maybe I'll touch on that later.

For now, as it stands today? Why would she? How could she? Bitcoin needs to be accessible, easy, and - dare I say it - *fun* to to use if it's ever going to succeed. Functional isn't good enough, and the discussion about the next steps needs to start now.

And for what it's worth, I'd just like to offer anything I can to improve the system.)

Thoughts?

[Edit] Wow, sadly, but I'll do what I can. The post from MtGox today implied that they're working on reducing the difficulty surrounding converting currencies, which would be a huge step in the right direction too.

Also realized I should have included my Bitcoin address!

1. Write a long post.
2. Get a ton of attention.
3. Don't include Bitcoin address.
4. ~~Profit!~~

My main problem with bitcoins is that eventually the number of bitcoins will be fixed at 21 million.  Right now


However, why risk your bitcions (for a better return) if you could get a less risky return by hoarding your coins?  


I have no problems with the fundamental idea of a crypto-currency, and bitcoins are stable, then there is no problem.  However, if you have an interest rate of 3%, and the currency is inflating in value by 10% (10% more purchasing power), then you're essentially paying ~13% interest.  This is extremely problematic and in my opinion, makes bitcoin un-adoptable on a larger economic scale.


In order for a currency to be successful, but with the same aspects of decentralization.  Inflating a currency disourages hoarding, encourages spending, encourages investing, and encourages leveraging.  These are all the hallmarks of a successful economy.


I'm glad I looked into bitcoin, because almost nobody has adopted the currency.


Fixed supply is why the Gold standard didn't work, monetary policy, taxation, other external factors).

* Only keep the minimum balance for trading
* Keep 95% of your bitcoin OFFLINE in cold-storage
* Use paper wallets or offline computers with Armory
* Generate keys and wallets offline

What you should do **ANYWAY**

* Use strong passwords
* Use two-factor
* Use Armory
* Use printed backups
* Buy a small home safe and/or rent a safety deposit box
* Spread your bitcoin across multiple storage locations
* Be very careful with encryption and backups

I got about 2 bitcoin as payment for a job I did online for someone, I sent about .9 bitcoin to there and tried to withdraw using their wire method. To my dismay I got nailed by a 2000jpy wire fee from mt.gox, followed by a $15 foreign transfer fee from Chase. So, that basically cut my income by half. Enough to make me not want to use Mt. Gox anymore.

Then, as I was stuck in the ""verification"" section of the coinbase bitcoin plugin that the humble bundle was using. However, I did decide to check out coinbase and make an account there, and I must say, the fact that there's a $.15 flat fee makes it HUGELY more appealing than Mt. Gox, and even more so that I can just buy with the same bank account via debit too. It sucks it takes 5 business days to get my money into my account, but that's fine.


So, overall it's an excellent alternative to PayPal, and I look forward to offering Bitcoin for my contracting business in real life, and turning as many of my clients on to the idea as possible. I also wanted to just thank the community for all the information I've gotten before taking the dive! Thanks again!",,False,self,False,t3_1e6eb1

1364562595.0,1b8mtn,The largest Bitcoin exchange in Brazil gets hacked: depositors are not guaranteed to get their money back,avsa,172,34,111,"**Disclaimer: I'm not associated in any form with Mercado Bitcoin other than having done trades there. Luckily for me I didn't have any money there at the moment.**

Mercado Bitcoin, but the owner [just sent an email to all accounts](http://pastebin.com/PZfuZM3X) explaining he was hacked. I haven't seen it posted anywhere in English so I'l do my best to translate what I got.

As far as I understood, leaving MercadoBitcoin without enough BTC to pay back all the other depositors.

Mercado hasn't revealed how much was robbed or more details than that

1. Withdraws in Reais that were requested before the attack

2. Deposits in Reais that hadn't been credited yet

3. Current balances in Reais

4. Current balances in Bitcoins

Meaning that depending on how much was left

[I posted about MercadoBitcoin last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1axsml/a_tip_for_bitcoiners_with_brazilian_friends_or/) when I wanted to share the word that Bitcoins in reais where 25% overvalued over other currencies. I assumed it was mostly because of the small amount of sellers but it seems there was also another factor: lack of trust in the exchange.

I doubt this attack is related to this reddit post: this week Exame one big financial magazine in Brazil also had a feature in Bitcoins which mentioned the Mercado. Either this was an opportunistic hack or just a case of worse timing
