Now start your Internet Browser. Let us assume

On your first page you see something
It resembles Google

Be Happy. If so

When you want to search something using the URL Bar

Be Happy. If so

.

Uninstall Delta Search:

Now move your mouse to the three Lines on the upper right corner. Also called ""Options"".

Now go on ""Settings"" --&gt; ""On startup"" and click on ""Set pages"". You will see something called ""Delta Search"". Click on the cross. Now it shouldn't be your first page anymore.

Don't leave the Setting. You have to go on ""Search"" and click ""Manage search engines..."".
Make Google a default and click on the cross on ""Delta Search"".
Now using the URL Bar to search

Restart Chrome. Look on your first site. See Delta Search. Scream. Vomit like a lawn sprinkler.

Go back to Settings and see

Restart the process 3 to 5 times

Click your Windows Start-Button and go to ""Windows Control Panel"" --&gt; ""uninstall Programm"" and find the Delta ""Fucking"" Toolbar. Uninstall it.

Start Chrome. Restart the process before. It doesn't work. Bash into your keyboard again. Scream: ""FUUUUCK!!! Fuck you. You Fucking Delta Fuck. Noone likes you you fucking Fucknut.""

Take your Keyboard in your Hands and hit your screen while crying.

Now open your window

Understand why it's called Windows. (Even when it's not it's fault.)

Now you're done. Delta Search should be uninstalled properly now.

For those wondering, but it hasn't helped. The warranty support team has told me it's not a ""good reason"" due to all the parts being intact, so I need to brick this thing instead. A computer-wise friend was telling me to flash the bios and pull the battery out halfway, I just want to know how...

The Problem: The notebook goes to HP Recovery Manager when booted

Critical Information(Skip to last sentence for important info) : Last night, I had no other OS on my notebook. After going through the installation steps, I came to the last step: choosing the installation type. I chose the device /dev/sda2 ,type swap, no mount point, no format, size 480190 MB, then realised I shouldn't install it before I knew what I was doing and quit the installation. I then powered down the laptop down and went to sleep. The next morning

TL;DR: My Notebook of 2 years sends me to HP Recovery Manager after I made some changes to the partitions in a Linux Distro. The root cause seems to be 'system volume on disk is corrupt' according to Startup Repair.
