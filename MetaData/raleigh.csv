* **The Big Venue: The Lincoln Theatre** The biggest music bar in Raleigh, it's hard to say what will be at the Lincoln one night to the next. That said, they are the most consistant at booking bands everyone has heard of.
* **The Little Venue: Kings/The Pour House** Kings and Neptunes is split level bar that caters to the indie scene. Not a huge space, you can bet your ass it's hipster gold. The Pour House is a bit more... hippie? It's got a great scene and works very hard to bring good bands to the triangle.
* **The Townies: Slims/Dive Bar** Both are the hole in the wall bars where you'll get a new best fried and/or stabbed. Slims caters to the local music scene while Dive Bar caters to the heavy metal crowd. Both seem kind of scary from the outside
* **The Gay Bars: The Borough/Legends/Flex** The borough offers LGBT friendly dining. I've never seen that place get crazy nor have I ever felt uncomfortable there for being straight, queens, and much crotch grabbing. Maybe that was just the night I was there, but from what I understand, that's what it's generally like (correct me if I'm wrong)
* **The Beer Garden: Flying Sucer/The Raleigh Times** Both are water holes. The Flying Saucer has hundreds of beers on tap and in bottles
* **I JUST WANT TO DANCE: Mirage/Architecture/Solas/Red Room/The Hive/Neptunes** These are the bars where you go to get down. Loud music and expensive drinks are on order for the evening. If you go to these bars
* **Pubs: Tir Na Nog/Landmark Tavern/Mitch's Tavern** Really chill places to get a pint and chill with friends.
* **See and be Scene: Glennwood South/Fayetteville Street** Put on your best outfit
* **Billiards/Pool Hall: Buck's Billiards/Snooker's/Pantana Bob's/Sharky's** Although Buck's is technically in Cary it's one of the best place that's close to downtown to play pool, granted you tend to get more of the college crowd there prob due to it being on hillsborough st. Oh and there's Sharky's, they just recently came under new ownership and i believe they also have new tables. Talk about great food and drink specials.
* **Munchies: Snoopy's/Char-Grill/Mecca/Cook Out/Most Bars** Bars close at 2 am. at 2:01, most delicious drunk food you'll be able to get your hands on. Mecca closes when it runs out of food or the cooks feel like cleaning up, but it's worth it to get there early. Great diner food. Most places on this list will serve food (especially the pubs) and most of the food is great.

It was warm, my windows were down, and his wife was eaves dropping on us for 45 minutes! (OFC I didn't know it was his wife. It was a lady who was parked near us for a long while, then parked in front of their home for another fifteen minutes, then finally went in.)

",adamtrimmer5,45,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/urrn4/ok_so_i_am_going_to_start_posting_a_thread/



There are so many people that are simply looking for stuff to do or just people to hang out with every weekend

Here is how it will work. Post something you are doing or something your looking to do in the comments. Other redditors will see that and comment ""I am in"", and put everyone in the OP under the edits.  I will post them in as best order as I can so that things that are happening on Friday come up on top.

 An example I will give is that I saw a couple separate redditors are going to the railhawks game on Saturday(i think that's the day) So i would make an edit post on the thread similar to this:

**Carolina Railhawks Game Saturday 8:15** *drinking optional* (I 
Redditors going (2)&lt;-- number will increase as people comment)
Meet up at the snack bar at 8:00 &lt;-- I will need OP's idea for a spot for to meetup. The person who suggests the event or what ever will give a brief description that I will put right here. 

**The first Rule of this thread will be: do not post stuff you are doing unless you want to invite people to it**. So if your going to a house party but you don't know if you can invite people to it, and meeting new people. 

**The second rule is: don't be shy**. Your event doesn't have to be the coolest thing ever. If you want to sit at home and play video games put it up

Lets give it a try

what do you guys think?

What I had in mind was a session going over safety and handling and then a trip to one of the local ranges.  I am a certified Range Safety Officer.  I would see us going to one of the two local PUBLIC ranges
    
I would like to keep this both safe and productive so would like to limit the group size to no more than 2 per person instructing

If interested respond here or PM me.

EDIT:
prerequisites: if you just want to shoot a .22 rifle, must be over 21.
Any range we go to will require a safety test before shooting, no pregnant weapon(lead dust is bad), no food at/on the range. be ready to practice, and have money for lane fees(around 15 dollars an hour, 1 dollar per target I think, and 15-20 for box of ammo or more depending on what you want to shoot(.22 is cheap will start there, other calibers are more expensive), hot brass is hot.

I have chosen Pullen park because it is the least headache for me and I hope that everyone can make peace with the decision. I understand that some of you guys don't like the idea of a potluck, after-all it isn't about the food it's about the people.

Everyone who can make it, but you better bring yourself!*

I will buy some patties and an array of hot dogs and buns from BJs. (Unless someone knows where I can get the goodstuff). If you are a grilling expert (or have a grill you can bring) then please indicate so in the comment or PM me

If anyone can come about 20 minutes earlier and help me set everything up then please PM me. I'm hoping to setup some activities e.g.: sack race.

Oh and **NO ALCOHOL** in the park

1374590634.0,1ivx4h,Two new taco and pizza restaurant discoveries,kcsquared,23,3,15,"I'm bored and not working today so I'm gonna spout off about food because food makes me happy.  

Over the weekend I was over at Justin's (Millbrook and Falls) having a shwarma when I noticed a pizza joint that I had never seen before.  It's called Cristos Ny Style Pizza and it is right beside Tijauna Flats.  I finished my shwarma and still had enough room for a slice so I popped into Cristos to give it a try.  It was awesome.  Best NY style I've had in the Triangle.  Their sauce and crust is so damn yummy.

  When it comes to NY style, and Randys but my all time favorite in the area is Salvatores which doesn't really count because apparently you can only get his pizza at Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival which I frequent twice a year.  But now I'm thinking that Cristos might actually be better than Salvatores.  I don't know.  I'd have to try them side by side.  Cristos is definitely the closest thing to Salvatore's in the area.

As for tacos...I was on my way to Popeye's Chicken and if you are a fan of Popeye's then you know that the only one is in east Raleigh on New Bern Ave.  On the way there I noticed a place called The Taco Market directly across the street so I popped in there to get a torta.  I'm a huge fan of tortas.  I pull in the drivethru, pay, and then wait a good 7-10 minutes.  I immediately thought that this is a good sign because I don't want no stinkin' premade, microwaved torta.  So, she comes back to the window and hands me my torta, asks me if I want any homemade hot sauce and I say yes.  As she is gathering the sauce, this delicious smell of the torta fills my car and when she returns I tell her that I can tell by the smell that this is going to be a good torta.  She laughs and I drive off.  The smell becomes so strong that I can't take it anymore so I open that puppy up at the next stop light and gobble half of it down.  It was awesome and all over my shirt.

I arrived to the house and immediately began dissecting it's contents.  Tortas are rarely ever constructed the same way but this one is how I want all future tortas.  Seasoned chicken, jalapeno, onions, refried beans, guacamole, AND two slices of bacon between the most delicious crispy and fluffy homemade torta bread.  Why did they include bacon on a chicken torta?  Because bacon.

With that being said, radishes, jalapenos, sauteed onions, hot sauce etc.  The tacos were ok but the torta was phenomenal.

I was at a conference conference, but no where nearly as good + cool as Parker's.  

Non BBQ: I tried Sitti, delicious food.  The conference made us eat at the Big Easy one night, and that place is a disgrace.  The worst thing is that we had people there from other countries, and New Orleans has one of this country's most interesting and delicious cuisines,  but that food was an embarrassment.

The management won't pay for our motel bills. They also refuse to put us in their vacant apartment right above us without charging us for the third bedroom (ours is a two bedroom two bathroom apartment). Apparently, or so we've been told by the mold inspectors.

I can't get a hold of my attorney as of right now

Here's some pictures of the mold if anyone is curious (http://imgur.com/a/O37kq)

I've been able to convince them to reimburse us for staying at a motel until they get the mold issue resolved by a professional crew.

We tried Seattle

**What we're tired of:**

* Going to the same few places to eat, pine trees are beautiful, but I've been looking at them for 20 years now!), the same few parks. We're tired of not having variety.

* There's nothing to do here but camping and shopping

* California transplants have driven home prices and rent prices to an absurd level. You pay a lot for a house in a subdivision of .2 acre lots and no yards. We're over it.

* It's expensive to fly in and out of our airport and we absolutely LOVE to travel. If we want to take the family to Disenyland, Maine, Florida, etc., it would cost several thousand if we planned ahead. It simply costs too much to experience the country, and the world, from this part of the US.

* The weather is relatively extreme with summers seeing mostly 90+ (up to 110) and winters that are long and wet. 



**What we think we are looking for:**

* We are good people, and we have heard that this can be the case in that region of the country.

* We want to be able to meet people easily. I love to do everything from working on my classic cars to weekend adventure guy trips to gaming to golf and a lot of stuff in-between. My wife loves to socialize. My children like golf and Lego and gaming. We want an easy way to meet people like s

* We like to eat out

* As a user interface designer and software developer, I am a big fish in a small pond and it's difficult to progress professionally.

* A place where we can get a lot of house for our money (anything under $3k a month for a rental is fine) renting without having to settle for .25 acre cookie cutter lots in poorly planned subdivisions. We don't care if the houses are the same

* More *stuff* to do. We would like to be close (within a couple hours travel time by car) to resorts, museums, plays, couples retreats, horseback riding, boating, summer camps for the kids, and anything else that will enrich our lives

* My wife loves the snow, we would end up in Florida. We're looking for something inbetween, but close enough to both that a half-day drive or an hour-or-two flight can get us to either depending on the season.

* Our oldest will be going to college in the next couple years and we would like to have a good local college so she doesn't have to move too far from home.



It has really started to hit home that we are wasting our lives living so far removed from what metro areas have to offer. They are so, I get this anxious sinking feeling that these are moments I wouldn't be wasting if we were somewhere with more to offer. We are interested in Raleigh because it is somewhat centrally located to the placed we want to visit (Maine, DC, Boston, Florida, everything in-between, international flights) and the airport is large enough that flights are relatively inexpensive. The housing prices are low for what you can get

I've done quite a bit of research about Raleigh and Cary so my questions aren't just about where to live. I can answer those questions myself. I'm more curious if the picture I've put together in my head of Raleigh is accurate or if I'm fooling myself.

My boyfriend and I have lived in Oakland, their self entitled ""F-you"" attitude, the crime, the crowds and the noise among other things. I hate that when I hear a sound outside my window I have to pause and think - was that a firecracker or should I be reporting gunshots? Our car has ended up with bullet holes before. I hate this city. I hate this state. I yearn for the small town quiet like feel that I grew up with in Ohio. (Why don't we move to Ohio or NJ? We dislike snow!)

What I do like about it is the opportunities I've had to meet different people and learn so many new cultures. I like that the people I work with are educated and interesting. I like that people are accepting of other lifestyles. I have gay friends

I know that Raleigh and the surrounding area has a pretty OK job market for my field (I'm a project manager for web/app/digital design) and I am not too concerned with finding work. I also know that we'll be able to comfortably live on a salary typical for my work.

Wingnut is shy and fluffy. She will sit in the hallway like a Buddha statue and just purr. She sleeps with her paws in the air and be the laziest thing in the world

As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. McIntyre voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse. I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving into the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this.

- Didn't take care of the cat very well.
- Couldn't make rent or car payments. 
- Had an arrest record for charges including writing worthless checks. 
- Had a reputation with nearby neighbors as being crazy and having a drinking problem. 

Here are my questions. What legal obligations do I have to give the cat back?  Shelters will only hold a lost animal for 3-5 days before they give it up for adoption. Does this apply to us? We have documented files showing we made an effort. 

If she insists on wanting the cat

Any advice on how to handle this lady when she finds out she'll need to pay at minimum $400?  The total will likely be much higher after we tally up all the food

Should be noted that this lady also lives very close to us and thanks to the neighbor

I'll be mostly working

My plane tickets &amp; hotel are already paid

* how much is regularly spent by day/week in food and just ""living""? That means
* is it easy (and not too expensive!) to rent a car and visit the mountains or the beaches? Or just move around town?
* How is the weather in October? Is already ""heavy winter""? or still leaving summer?
* Any links to ""new age"" (the religious view) communities?

I represent a Raleigh, be careful) who’s interested in taking things to the next level for in-house events and local tournaments. There’s no hiding the fact that the entire Triangle area in North Carolina is pretty quiet when it comes to StarCraft II, even when major events like MLG come to town (always the most under-hyped IMO). We’re in the process of running some small in-house tournaments trying to nail down a system that we can use to provide larger LAN-based tournaments to the entire Triangle area. If all goes well, we’ll push this further to NC, but yeah, we’ll get to that later.

We’re going to be hosting the finals for our in-house tournament season next weekend, and the last major one is casting. We have our own players swapping out for casting during the games, and to be honest, we’re Bronze through Diamond, so it’s a little hit and miss...SOOOOO!!!!!

Are you old enough to drive? Old enough to party (oh baby)? Love StarCraft II to pieces, NC is supposed to kick off. We’d really like to find a caster we can work with and get used to the set up so that we can provide a great production, it’s always good to find a new friend local, this should be a great opportunity to be a front face for a hopefully great digital production!

In addition to the link to our tournament website in the title, etc.), my apartment and some of the people involved. Right now there are 13 of us (give or take one depending on who’s playing on a given weekend). If you’re interested, I’d invite you out to my apartment this coming weekend for a cookout to maybe meet some of the guys and enjoy the good weather. Maybe we can add someone totally sweet to our rag-tag outfit of players.
