I noticed that post yesterday, news and other interesting stuff. The post in question had literally zero content, it's a screenshot of a common Ubuntu operation with caption implying that it works as advertised.

I convened with the other mods, and yet for various reasons I feel like this is a danger if we let such low content posts stay.

I'd like to have your opinion about memes, and we sometimes consider outright banning them; but I believe this community belongs to its subscribers rather than its moderators, and this is a decision that belongs to you.

PLEASE UPVOTE THIS POST SO OTHERS CAN SEE, because it's important to get a wide array of opinions on the subject.

I mean, before I felt confident enough to call myself a ""Linux user"". Now the installation takes 10 minutes (Literally), and it installs ALL drivers, and sends me directly to a recognizeable desktop. No fiddling around in terminals. Even my fucking webcam works..... And ALL the buttons on my keyboard, even the ones adjusting volume, and touchpad! Wow! I NEVER thought that it would be possible to make it this user-friendly.

I installed Ubuntu again because I didn't want to buy a Windows copy, and the ones I do play like Minecraft are supported anyway. And all the applications are not really that big of an issue; since they have their (Admittedly) shittier Open Source counterparts. And then I installed it, and find out that Valve are going absolutely nuts and are currently porting a shitload of titles to Ubuntu. And Nvidia too! Video adapter drivers used to be hell, but all of a sudden I can literally run TF2 *better than I did in Windows*. It looks incredibly promising. I nearly came in my pants the first time I started steam natively in Linux without use of WINE. I was contemplating dual-boot, but you know what? No reason to do it anymore.

And the application called ""PlayOnLinux"" just taked WINE to a completely new level. I remember running notepad and the windows native calculator on that thing - but now I can literally run Portal2. And with great performance! I would never... EVER have expected that. I thought my decision to go Ubuntu would mean sacrifices

So far, really made me irritable. That is not what GNU/Linux should be about. But knowing the OS, I knew that there was some kind of hack for it somewhere. I didn't even need the hack. I was happy to find that I could turn it right off in the privacy settings, and now I feel like a boss.

Even when I want to fiddle around and do the kind of stuff that I can't do in Windows, and paste whatever command is the solution. I vaguely remember having apt-get in Debian (And in Red Hat too); but I don't at all remember it being this easy. And solving technical issues in Windows honestly never has been this simple. I haven't been forced to use vi yet, and the only time I've had a crash in the past week was when my spotify script looped and flooded the memory. OK, I'm rambling and I'm going to stop now, because you already know all of this.

I said ""which one?...""(I have 3) ""the one you are in front of right now sir"" ""Uh... I'm not at my computer

FF to today, ok, whats the worst he could do, gave him the login info and proceeded to hold back the laughter while he scurried his mouse around clicking away, trying to figure out what he was into and how to show me what was making my computer slow. Finally he asks what OS I was running and then he called his supervisor who told me there were dangerous programs on my computer. ""I haven't downloaded any dangerous programs"" I said. Then the supervisor directed me to go to another website, I guess since they couldn't ""show me"" these malicious programs they skipped the fear mongering and still tried to sell me one of their protection packages. I said ""no thanks"" and he said ""ok, thank you for your time"" Yea

**TL;DR**
scam caller tried to convince me there was something slowing my computer

Make sure to follow the installation instructions

Benefits of running a game this way:

* No matter what the game is

* It may run faster

* If the game crashes the X server for some reason it won't take out your other applications

* Even games that allow switching back to other applications sometimes mess up when you restore their size

Future plans: I have a few more ideas floating in my head to use this system to make multiple monitor gaming *just work* on Linux, etc, and use Ctrl+Alt+F7 and Ctrl+Alt+F8 to switch between the game and your desktop, as with the single monitor (I think that would work, right?). Thoughts?

Anyway, anyway. All the quirks about Unity that I did not like in the past are different or gone to a point where I enjoy using the computer now.

My company recently moved to a proxy-based Internet connection for all employees

It turns out that only a bunch of applications honor the global Unity proxy settings: other applications  use their own configuration and refuse to read the global settings. Other applications
To make things worse

So far this is the situation as I see it:

1- the first step is to enter the proxy configuration in the system settings. This dialog should set the environment variables http_proxy, but for some mysterious reason some want the uppercase version of the variable (HTTP_PROXY). 

The second problem is that the config dialog does not give the option of entering a username and password for the proxy

2- so naturally the second step is to set these values in the env variables by hand using the command line

3- third step, chrome, skype etc., which have their own individual config dialogs (and where the “use system wide settings” fails to work).

4- fourth step

5- discover now that if you need to add a PPA or a key from the keyserver this is still not enough

    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver-options http-proxy=http://URL:PORT/ --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys GPG_KEY

While to add a PPA you must explicitly tell sudo to consider the environment variables:

    export http_proxy=http://&lt;proxy&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
    export https_proxy=http://&lt;proxy&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
    sudo -E apt-add-repository ppa:whatever

I feel that this problem needs to be addressed ASAP if we want Ubuntu to gain traction in the corporate world. The current state of things is simply not acceptable.

I have always liked Ubuntu and used it on and off over the years since Dapper Drake but I never stuck with it, functioned pretty much the same, essentially it was just another one to choose from. 

Now, a bit haphazard. For example, I sometimes use my girlfriends laptop which has Windows 7, I feel it looks cluttered, there is so much going on. However, in Ubuntu, there is very little going on, the tray icons are all the same colour. Windows Explorer filled with the various textures and multiple bars but Nautilus is more calm and softer. The start menu

Another point is the post-installation process. After installing Windows 7 the laptop and I spent about twenty minutes tweaking Windows - removing icons from the desktop and taskbar, installing free software and missing drivers, turning off all the Windows features - of course it is not something that needs to be done often, it is still a bit of a chore, whereas with Ubuntu 12.04, all I needed to do was set the Unity bar to autohide and just get on with using the computer. I just don't need to be adjusting lots of different things after every install. Most software I needed were included as well. Other Linux distributions and previous Ubuntu releases needed a bit of tweaking. It gets old after a while.

There isn't any 32bit version because I have a 64bit PC with 4GB of ram and I am never going to run a 32bit OS on this PC.

All this Distro is, music and web content .eg [flash and java](http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4931/plugins10001.png), plus I have done a few fixes as well. like fixing wireless problems, gwibber's facebook problem and flash videos in fullscreen.

Everything is setup for samba

I have added a Upnp server as well so you can share your music

Nautilus has been changed for Elementary-Nautilus with added plugins so it can get music and video art from the web.

The default theme is Elementary using ttf-droid font with Docky and a custom Conky.

The tv plays youtube, the trashbin is clearly a widget, the clock and alarm clock actually work, the books also serve as launchers, the top bar with the date lets me know of future events. I created the desktop for fun, but don't really recommend it as screenlets seem to use a lot of RAM.

[update]JohnPickens called this ""Ubuntu Bob"" and it got me thinking. You could really play around with this design and make it even better if you used multiple desktops and each one represented a different room. The way I would do it, and then make each wallpaper a different section of a house for example: one is the entertainment room, one is the office, the other is studio..etc..  I think it's possible with the tools we have in Karmic.

[Update 2] A few people commented that they'd like to see me prove this desktop works. So I figure if I'm going to go through the trouble of making the video

I am newish to linux and ubuntu but I think I see a parallel that needs examining.

Here is how I see things as an avid Android consumer and partial developer. Android and Ubuntu are both open source and share some very close similarities now that Ubuntu Touch is out. But both are open source. Canonical is starting to act more like Google in terms of how it is building its OS. They are going their own direction to a certain extent and in my opinion

However, and third party developments. AOKP, CyanogenMod, and Paranoid Android etc. This is very similar to how Linux is panning out. There is the Source, and different ""flavors"", Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint

In both worlds, both Android and Linux have changed drastically since their beginnings. It happens and it is a good thing.

Now i understand the Canonical/Ubuntu - Google/Android parallel isn't exactly equivalent. Where I see people getting upset is long time users who have used Ubuntu since maybe the beta days and don't like that it is very different from how it used to be
Here is what i say to you. If this upsets you, dual booting and live CD's but I kept falling back on Windows when it didn't work. Now, with 12.10, I can say that, Linux works for me, and many more people. Isn't that the whole point??",,,,

**A).Get redshift from the software centre. This app reduces the colour temperature at night

For the newbies on this forum

1) Create a file called redshift.sh. Put it in any folder you like.


2)Add these lines:


\#! /bin/bash


gtk-redshift -l [Latitude]:[Longitude] -t [Color temperature at daytime]:[Color temperature at nighttime]


an example would be 


gtk-redshift -l 30:9 -t 6100:4300


3) Make the file executable by right-clicking on it and going to properties &gt; permissions


4). Now go to startup applications and add this file to the list of startup programs.


**B). Use xbacklight to lower screen brightness at startup**


Create a file and add these lines to it:


\#! /bin/bash


xbacklight -set 45


Make this file executable and a startup program as I have shown you how to in the first example.


The brightness will automatically be set lower every time you login. Unfortunately


I don't consider myself to be an expert by any means. If you have any tips

2. It's been delayed further

3. It's 13.04 now, 

And frankly, it stays the same way, despite a fix [being tested numerous times](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ayatana-ubuntu/+bug/805264).

So Canonical, why not bring **some actual polish** to the desktop instead?

Given that this fix has been released for almost 2 years

Thoughts? Maybe we'll even have translucent window borders to stop desktop background clashing soon :)

Today I woke up to receive an email from Ubuntu Forums (forums@ubuntu.com) telling me that the site has been compramised. I went to the [Ubuntu Forums website](http://ubuntuforums.org/announce.html) and it seems that the news is true.

There are certain concerns about this attack, but it's still recommended to use strong hashes.

So I'd like to start with my questions:

* Are the Ubuntu Forums using strong hashing schemes such as BCrypt or are they using one round of MD5/SHA1?
* Are the Ubuntu Forums using unqiue saltes?

Here's the story. I have a junker laptop that fried its hard drive, I buy a used hard drive ($25, because a new one would have exceeded the replacement cost of the computer), and moped home, worrying that a Linux install would leave me the way I usually deal with computer problems: swearing a lot and breaking things.

Instead, wireless will cause me headaches, the usual. But- screw it.

Instead- flawless install. No swearing. Very slick. I reboot, but the next thing I know, I'm on Reddit with Firefox, checking my email, playing Tetris. Back to wasting my life.

All I use that laptop for is writing (OpenOffice), and checking my email by web. And now it does all that, plus more. I'd switch my other systems, were it not for how I have files all over the place- and the other laptop runs nothing but my custom Access database.

My mid range gaming PC started to be plagued by a number of issues.  First, I have been plagued with random reboots, especially when playing games.

Software upgrades and hardware diagnostics availed me not.  Aside from one BSOD

Earlier today, I realized why that was after trying a few Steam games.  

I was getting nowhere... messages that lead nowhere until I tried Skyrim, I realized something was up.  After disabling my second monitor and restarting X, I was able to choose my native resolution for my main monitor and...

START PLAYING!!!

That felt great.  The last time I tried to do anything serious on a Linux desktop

Edit: It was a real bonus to see my Naga was working without any need for extra drivers... gives me real hope for my main addiction: WoW

Edit:  I was able to get Skyrim working and that was a blast.  Loaded my last saved game copied over from Windows... killed some wild life

This lead me to believe something may have been wrong with my windows install causing the crashes and lockups.  I decided to reinstall Windows but now I wanted to try an SSD.  I went out and got a 180GB one and started the install.  Windows locked up just as it tried to load the installer.  Hmm... let's try again... hmm... not even getting a POST from the BIOS now... but I do see blinky lights on my HDD access light and my optical drive.

I had high hopes for ubuntu 13.04, because it looked like it would fix a lot of my problems with quantal, and even donated 50 dollars on the download page. Boy was I wrong.

1. Apparently just about a week before 13.04 was released a huge kernel update was released with many code changes. This causes a wide range of severe issues for many people, to shutdown hangs. Its been a month and there still has not been a fix released (only just barely reached -proposed). If they had had any sense at all they would have rolled back this disastrous update before release.

3. The default instant messaging/ubuntu online accounts is a total mess. Trying to add a facebook account opens up firefox instead of the ubuntu SSO browser so I can't even add the facebook account. Adding a google account works but it CONSTANTLY stops working and asks for ""authorization"". Clicking the button next to the authorization message does nothing and I have to reboot to get the damn account to work.

4. Lots of issues with nautilus. Sometimes re-ordering bookmarks causes nautilus to crash, it gives some random gvfs error and fails (and this one seems specific to ubuntu, I've never seen that problem with upstream nautilus 3.6.3 on other distros I've used)

And all these issues are known bugs that I experienced on a clean and updated install

The worst thing is many of these problems have had ""fix committed"" for a very long time

I think there is something very, or perhaps the SRU process should be re-thunk.

2. Core features of Nvidias Tegra (since Tegra4) align with what the Edge is supposed to do. The software modem takes no space

3. Nvidias HDR technology is optimized for close personal shots

4. Nvidia claims to have/has always the fastest SoC, and Cuda will make it attractive for desktop stuff too, something other SoC's can't do. In the video linked above Huang even promoted the same convergance vision.

Offline messages are a mess - they only arrive when the user who sent them logs in, so I have no idea what type of animation the Windows user I'm sending to is receiving.

1.  It caused compiz to chew through RAM.  I've seen compiz use over 1500 MB (I have 2GB).
2.  When I'd wake the computer
3.  It crashed on me.  Gnome has NEVER crashed on me.
3.  Global menu infuriates me.  I have no idea what menu options are available
4.  The window controls change position if the window is maximized.
5.  The window controls are on the wrong side.  This is partly preference
6.  The Unity launcher takes too long to open when I want it
7.  Two panels are completely unnecessary.  This applies to GNOME 2.32 as well, and set it to auto-hide.  If your argument for moving the panel to the left edge of screen is to ""preserve usable screen space"", this makes no sense.
8.  It's hard to open programs that aren't in the launcher if I don't know what they are called.  I can right-click on the magnifying glass that doesn't zoom
9.  There's also the other magnifying glass that doesn't zoom
10.  Dash takes up the whole screen to show very few options.
11.  The mechanics for rearranging the launcher are strange.
12.  Also, the pointless differences infuriated be when I'd switch between them.  Like the launcher on the left vs. bottom (even windows let's me customize this), close buttons on the left
91.  Switching to different windows in the same app is awkward.

Things I DID like about Unity:

1.  Shortcut keys

So, it performs well, but it doesn't look quite as good.  It does seem to take longer to load even though I've swapped my gnome startup apps (gnome-do, guake) for KDE versions (yakuake).

a. No configuration options means that my grandmother can't break anything anymore

b. I won't have to remember how windows works every time that my grandmother needs help

c. We are power users; we break software and put it back together for fun. When did we all turn into pussies who can't install software for ourselves anymore? Why do we care what comes preinstalled? 

d. Canonical has clearly been saying that it is not pulling the 200 million users goal from nowhere

e. Is it really so hard to believe that we aren't the target market for this distro? There are a ton of linux distros out there all aimed at power users

Having more users (especially the large corporations and OEM manufacturers that want to play ball with Ubuntu now that it has Unity as a Desktop) means more software being developed for Linux and Linux users won't have to have google develop a app so they can watch netflix. A linux distro aimed at our grandparents is the best thing that can happen to FOSS

f. Do we really believe that someone won't make a Unity-Tweak program to change everything that you want ubuntu to do... or a gnome 2 packet we can install after 11.10... or whatever missing option has gotten everyone's panties in a bunch. It's a 1.0 release guys, or just log into Classic.

With that being said, I can never successfully download FLGRX (Post-Release Updates) but I can download the regular FLRGX.

Remember when Shuttleworth said he wanted Ubuntu to reach 200 million users when 15.04 arrives
Well it's been around two years and while those kind of statistics are hard to measure

But it seems to me that there still is some hope for Ubuntu to succeed in getting a wider user base.

According to [this](http://blog.projectz.me/2013/03/03/theres-something-ubuntu-needs-to-do-if-the-phone-is-going-to-work/) article at projectz.me it seems that Ubuntu needs to expand where the rest of ""them"" are weakest - the mobile market in the business world.

**What I got from the article**:


The situation in the business world is as follows: It's not as heavily occupied by iOS and Android as it looks. According to the article both iOS  and Android have poor management and their updates are causing more problems than they fix (for business users). As it is right now, X megapixel cameras and Facebook integration in the business world. What matters is management and security, and security breaches in Android (according to the article) doesn't help with the reliability on the Android front. 

*Enter Ubuntu Phone.*

Ubuntu Phone might just provide what these businesses, full fledged computer. It's got security built right in since it's Ubuntu. And it's easily manageable from an IT department, because of Ubuntu Server, Landscape and Cloud. And it's dependable because of the Long Term Support stuff.

Those are going to be the main selling points for businesses. The reason they should choose Ubuntu over

**TL;DR**:
iOS and Android are consumer operating systems that aren't suited for the business world. 
Ubuntu Phone actually is. 


**So

^This ^is ^actually ^where ^I'm ^gonna ^need ^correction ^if ^since ^I'm ^not ^so ^sure ^about ^the ^LTS ^side ^of ^Ubuntu. 

What I understand is this: 
Ubuntu is basically running two release cycles at the time. 
A release ever six months and another (LTS) every two years. 

Now
Kids

How is Ubuntu ever going compete on that market if Ubuntu isn't supposed to put out too many new feature updates? And then expand to the desktop too?

It's easy: 
Divide development into two categories:
LTS for the business side 
Short term releases for cool stuff that appeals to the general user.

What do you guys think? Can Ubuntu cater to both business and general users if they get a foothold in the business first?

Here's the dilemma: Stallman says to ""remove Ubuntu from the distros you recommend or redistribute"", Linux Mint stands for staying the same. When Ubuntu made the bold decision to universalize their UI by doing Unity, Linux Mint took advantage of this by...staying the same. They appeal the the crowd who want something familiar, and that's fine, but do we really want the distro representing linux to the the one that bases itself on stagnancy? This isn't meant to be a Mint bashing, but I think it's important that we realize the significance of what distro we start recommending. If we have a distro that isn't bold enough to incorporate big changes, linux isn't going anywhere quickly. 

Other than Mint, there isn't really anything I can recommend besides Ubuntu. 

I hope to spark a debate. Tell me what distro you're going to start recommending.

Maybe some suggestions on Gnome/Unity/XFCE or whatever would be nice...

Thank you


**EDIT**: Thank you so much for all of the replies everyone.  To answer the ""Wait until 12.04"" comment; I wanted to.  I even told her about the differences between LTS and other versions.  However, she can roll with the 12.04 update when it comes in a few weeks.

**EDIT 2** Install is done.  Currently I have Unity set, better transparency and so forth.  Set up the printer (through our windows home server), and also have added Minecraft (because that's a requirement in this house, damn it). Also, I added an install of windows in VirtualBox and didn't tell her.  I want her to not know the crutch is there, and if the need arises we will venture into that realm.  Mostly I think it will be used for Spotify (so that there doesn't have  to be a monthly fee, which is required on the Linux beta).

I installed Ubuntu for about 4 years on my desktop server, I didn't use it much.  Rather, I was just curious what all the fuss was about.  This instance on my netbook is the first time I've actually run Ubuntu as a host OS. I installed it because of my frustration with Vista.

Despite running Avast, Vista ran like a turtle on this netbook but Ubuntu feels so much faster (at least so far-hopefully, it won't slow down the way Windows machines inevitably do over time).

The Ubuntu installer is so well crafted. My netbook doesn't have an optical drive, and it gave me the option to overwrite it or install along side it, reconfiguring partitions on the fly, which is what I did.

I was really impressed that Ubuntu gave me the option to automatically download updates during the installation. Windows doesn't do that! Also, touchpad, camera, bluetooth, USB, etc).

That's simply amazing

If I can get Vista operational

I'm still amazed that Ubuntu is ""free.""  If my positive experience continues after a few weeks

But because we all, people allowing this to happen, will not be considered a community by those being harassed, and should not be seen as such by anyone else until we get our act together and stand up for the right of anyone in it to be themselves.

**[This is the story that made me write this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/lr1tl)

Skud is an important female voice in FOSS. Quite literally as a public speaker at conferences, which is a huge deal.

Why get a panic attack from that? If you're in technology you should only expect that what you do gets posted online. Sounds like a weak women, and if you had to explain to your boss why someone might call to say that you are distributing child porn.

All of this has happened to Skud and so many other women who have dared to be visible in technology and Free Software. And because of this she and many others like her have quit the tech business or stepped out of the FOSS community. One of the really bad incidents for Skud was after a speech at the Open Source Convention.

This is a tragedy and a shame. We have to start taking seriously that harassment like this is creating huge problems, these kinds of attacks are effectively censorship as good as any other.

Even among the majority of men and women who do not harass we need to be more aware. Of course we need to be active in denouncing harassment and always speak up when someone talks and behaves unacceptably [at conferences](http://geekfeminism.org/2011/10/19/wednesday-geek-woman-unnamed-complainant-at-javaone/)

But we also need to be more aware of our own ingrain, unless we make an effort to be conscious about it. Things we don't think about at all might for women feel like a barrier to being as integrated a part of the community as the men. As just one example the [choice of t-shirts at conferences](http://geekfeminism.org/2011/10/18/t-shirts-yet-again/) might make women feel less welcome.

There are tons of ""passive"" things like this that we need to start taking seriously. And there's tons of active things we need to start doing to get a more diverse and Open community where anyone and everyone have the Freedom to contribute

For help with identifying both passive and active things you should be aware of and do

**Edit:** Hi guys and galls :)

Thank you all for your enthusiasm around this topic! I just wanted to make a few things clear:

* Yes, but a big problem in tech and FOSS. The Geek Feminism Wiki has [gathered a list of well known incidents](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Incidents), but this is only some of the big things. *The cumulative effect of the small, almost invisible things; everyday teasing/low level harassment, focus on looks, etc, is just as important. This is a widespread problem

* No, and Ubuntu is a big part of that movement. You might not agree with me that it is such a widespread problem, but it is a big problem for those affected by it and so we must talk about it and do something about it. *Note that I'm not saying this is a bigger problem in the Ubuntu community than in any other part of FOSS, or even tech. Ubuntu even has some great [community guidelines](http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/conduct) for dealing with this. But it's still a problem here, so we need to talk about it.* Just like I might say to one organization within (i.e.) the environmental movement that they need to be aware of a specific issue (i.e. the disproportionally few black people in environmental groups), even though that issue might not be a bigger problem in that specific organization than in the movement/community as a whole. I just might feel closer connected to that organization. But I do want to crosspost this in r/opensource etc. too.

* English is not my mother tongue

* Thank you all again. :)

**Edit 2**: Just two more points I want to address:

**""If you're public/get notoriety/active online you will be harassed, not just women. It is not acceptable no matter who it is targeted at, and we need to fight against all of it. What I am arguing is that the threshold for getting harassed because of sticking your neck out in tech and FLOSS is much lower for women than for any other group in our community, and that we can't tolerate that. *We can't tolerate any harassment of any group, of course, but it very much seems like women are disproportionately affected and so that's the group I wanted to focus on now.*

If we plot online activity/fame and level of harassment on a scale from 1-100, while a women only needs to be at level 30-40 to reach the same amount of harassment. This is of course only an illustration. I don't know if the scale is correct here). This is of course only in general, not true in every single incident (i.e. there might be many men getting harassed more at a lower level of activity than many women at a higher level, and the other way around, without that invalidating the argument that in general women is affected worse, sooner)

**""There's nothing we can do about this (short of inflicting censorship/horribly invasive surveillance)""** - Sorry, to say rude things, to behave terribly towards people straight to their face if they where ""different"" (skin colour, mental issues, physical disabilities, etc.). Children could stand and point and laugh while their parents watched. This is mostly not the case any more. Some people still insist on calling dark skinned people ""nigger"", but those are mainly a  minority and not much respected. It's the same online. Some online communities are mostly friendly and helpful (see e.g. Caterina Fake [talking about Flickr as a big party](http://netmagazine.com/interviews/in-depth/caterina-fake))

*So clearly there are things that can be done to change the direction one way or the other. What are those things, and make clear trough our actions, inactions and words, what kind of community we want (open, inclusive, free, etc.). And what kind we don't want.*

Most of the ""rules"" behind the way we behave and talk are internalized, might lead to us doing/saying things that feels like rejections/unwelcoming to some groups, without us realizing at all. Other things we might realize could be taken in a bad way, but because we don't feel the weight of all the unintentional and intentional acts of harassment that the members of the group do all the time, we don't think it's that bad (because it's not by itself, but nothing is only by itself).

If what I wrote can inspire some people to think the slightest about these kinds of things, then I'm happy.",,False,,t5_2qh62,True,,
