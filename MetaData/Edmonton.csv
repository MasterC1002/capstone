My half-brother (and I use that term loosely because we consider each other brothers) was the driver of the car with the four teens who were killed that night. I've woken up at night for almost a year now, but I hope that anyone who has been or is in my situation can understand why I feel the way I do.

I'm posting this because I'm not only disgusted by the fact he has his license again; I'm not only sickened by the fact that the reason he got his license back was so he can, call a cab or take the bus or ride a fucking bicycle to get there. But no, this just shows people that if you make the CHOICE to drive drunk and kill four teenagers you can get your license because you ""have to get to work.""

I chose to post this to reddit over facebook on the CTV Edmonton facebook feed because I don't want to face the people on facebook who will defend Hobulwich and his DECISION to drive. I realize there will be people who say, really wasn't. He didn't just happen to stagger into his truck that night. He didn't just happen to slip and turn the key to start his truck. He didn't just happen to trip on the gas pedal and begin to drive; and when he crashed into my brother and his friends, he didn't just happen to slip and run away from the scene. He made the choice to drive. He made the decision to run.

My brother wouldn't drive drunk. He wasn't that kind of person. I love my brother with all my heart. He meant the world to me even if we didn't see each other a lot. For this..this pathetic human being to be able to drive again...I'm crushed reddit and my heart is breaking more than it can handle.

I have a good studded set and I was fine today. There were people fishtailing, spinning out, hitting other vehicles.

Please keep this in mind. You can bitch about the city not clearing the streets. You can put as much sand as you want all over the road. When it comes down to it everyone is much safer with winter tires.

http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/340174_10152126130315006_569694656_o.jpg

Jarrett Bortscher is missing. His family doesn't know where he may have gone

He has a mental health condition called catatonia. He also has aspergers

DESCRIPTION: 5' 4"" tall; 125 pounds; blue hazel eyes; dark blonde hair; 18-years-old

It's pretty unusual for him to be missing given his seemingly strict medication schedule. I know he has a tendency to go on very long walks to random places

He is officially listed as a missing person. Please call Edmonton City Police if you see him or hear anything about where he might be. Also Jarrett if you happen to log on and see this

**UPDATE:** He was last seen in walking last night in the Duggen Area. I've also added a second photo of him. 

**UPDATE 2:**

* HOTSPOTS TO LOOK FOR.
* Duggan Area
* Whyte Ave
* U of A area
* Legislature
* Emily Murphy park
* Hawrelak. 
* Churchill/City Hall/EPL area 
* These are his favorite spots.

It's official: our corpse flower (Amorphophallus Titanum) is in a flowering stage. Growing at a rapid rate of six inches per day, could reach a height of 10 feet. This will be first time that Western Canada has ever seen an Amorphophallus bloom.

The corpse flower is named for the stinky smell it emits to attract its pollinators -- carrion beetles. The flower only blooms for a brief 2-4 days. Seeing (and smelling) it will be a once in a life time experience that you will not want to miss. Keep tuned to our Facebook page for updates on Putrella's expected ""bloom date"".

So anyway, but we went to wunderbar instead. So I've kind of got it in my mind that I want to go to the pourhouse. However, looking over the menu, it seems kind of expensive, so I'm open to other suggestions (I prefer something around whyte or south side).

*And* that weekend happens to coincide with my real birthday. So I can maybe take some photos to put on facebook so my mom doesnt think I'm such a loser. 

Let me know what y'all think. I'm pretty set on that date

**Edit: So far I've had about 30 people indicate they'd come, and that they could only accommodate a reservation of up to 15 anyway. I'm going to call the black dog next, but if you have any other ideas let me know.**
    
**Edit 2: I've sent the black dog an e-mail. They have a room in the basement they might reserve for us on saturday**

Edit 3: So when I called the black dog they told me to just e-mail them the details, and as of yet have not heard back. Should I be concerned? ",,False,self,t5_2raht,True,,

The next week there was a huge [relatively for bboy events] rally down at Churchill. The entire cypher was dedicated to him and his struggle. They shouted out his name throughout the night and danced harder than they ever did before. All this for someone they hardly knew

I'm doing a bunch of contract work in the upcoming months

- most of the jobs will be running new network cables in restaurants. No electrical work or anything dangerous.
- most of the jobs will be night shifts
- most of the work is slightly physical, etc. No heavy lifting needed though.
- most of the work is a little gross. I never knew something could be fuzzy and greasy at the same time before this job. It's not awful
- pay is... Good. You'll be happy.

Requirements:
-Be cool. (you're a redditor
-Don't be uncool.
-Be reliable.
-Be smart. You don't have to learn a lot
- don't be dumb. 
- be the kind of person who tries hard.
- be the kind of person who can have fun. We like to have a good time.
- size doesn't matter. I have a 5'2 120# girl and a 6'5 240# guy. Just be able to put in a good day of decent physical work.

First thing one of them says after he comes in, then started looking around the living room. Then the other one started talking about how people in the area were complaining about the bills from Direct Energy and they were investigating it. Sure, fair enough, I thought. But then they started to ask us to provide them with bills from Direct Energy **AND** EPCOR so they they can copy them down. That's when my dad thought this is absurd, pushed them out the door and shut the door in their faces.

Oh yeah, however you want to put it.

They then went around the block knocking on everyone's house

So did anyone have similar experiences these few days? How did you deal with it? Am I just being paranoid or should I report this to somewhere?

Tl;dr, and asked for bills from Direct Energy and EPCOR. Is this a scam or is it just me?

Frought not, of frozen liquid crunching under your feet.

You may think yourself something of a spider beneath the master trees, the grips on your under-shoe giving you cocksure confidence and abilities in traversing many challenges of geological and topographic gradient. Feel constantly refreshed on your trekking with a breeze flowing in under the edge of your thigh-fabric. Laugh silently at your compatriots as they are bogged down by restricting material that traps the  moisture of the entire lower half of their body. Show them tacitly how it is to be free!

Your community feels poisonous and hateful. When people do interesting things in town

* Complaining that art or anything artistic is the realm of hipsters and thus must be derided. Really? You push against culture so hard that the only acceptable cultural event is one that is heavily commercially promoted and aligned with common pop interests?

* Downvoting anything that smells of event promotion. I want to hear about events thank you very much. This city has a huge communication issue and it is hard to hear about venues and events.

* Downvoting anything that's creative or took time and effort to create. The most recent instance is that guy who photographs event posters. Is it really so bad that he shares these posters with us?

* Downvoting any call for collaboration (there was some Edmonton wiki post a while ago like this). 

This all seems very strange given what tends to be popular on this board: lost cat postings, but there is this aggression on this board that is really irritating and needs to be addressed.",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,

1370539599.0,1fswlo,Concerns about the new South-East LRT Line,Mtnn,42,5,30,"I’ve been very excited about the LRT project and think improving transit for Edmonton is a great investment in the cities future. Last night I attended an information session on the South-East corridor that got me concerned that the design is not for users and priorities fail to address working people who need to travel from point A to point B. The system is going to cost $1.8 billion dollars and is slower than current bus systems. As someone who has used transit to get from south-east Edmonton to downtown the past few years I see this system as a step backwards and will explain why:

  •The train stops 10 times between Mill Woods Town Center and downtown. The projected travel time is currently 30 minutes. The bus route #15 currently takes 27 minutes to travel the same distance. 

  •The train route will travel along 83rd street taking over two lanes from car traffic. The existing road will become single lane north/south. This is one of Edmonton’s few north/south roads in the area.

  •Bus routes which currently flow along 83rd street will be redirected. Planners claim they will take parallel streets. What are the closest parallel streets to 83rd? 75th and 99th. South-east bus routes will be negatively affected and the displaced traffic and buses seem likely to cause even more traffic problems. 

  •There are no actual comparisons of capacity available anywhere on the City of Edmonton website. Page 8 of LRT for Everyone has an infographic with a lack of concrete numbers. http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/LRT_for_Everyone.pdf I asked at the information session: How many people can the train move downtown versus buses and compared with the existing high speed LRT? They have no estimates available.

  •While searching for more information I came across this blog: http://www.rapidtransitforedmonton.org/?page_id=145 which seems to echo some of my concerns. It goes into more detail about problems with the low floor designs and how the system doesn’t make sense for Edmonton.

I’d like to encourage everyone to visit http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/ets/lrt_projects/southeast-to-west-lrt-mill-woods-to-lewis-farms.aspx and voice feedback now while the project is still in the design phase before it’s too late. The cost of this system is more than three arenas and for what we seem to be getting it’s worth more discussion!

I ran the email address through Google

------

I inquired about a rental property in Edmonton. It had really nice pictures, two parking stalls and on 105th street. Asking $800. I knew from the start that it seemed way too low for what they were offering, but I inquired about why it was so low (could have been a temporary sublet or something).

Anyway

&gt;Hello
 
 
 
&gt;The apartment located in  10388 105 ST, Canada is in excellent condition and it's just like in the pictures, very clean and very well kept. Honestly from point of view I'm sure that you will rent it on spot. I'm not looking to make a business or a profit with the apartment, I'm just trying to find a responsible tenant to take good care of the place. The apartment has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It is furnished but if you want you can use your furniture and deposit mine in the storage unit near the building so is not far away. The rent is 800CAD/month with everything included (heat, hydro, water, electricity, 2 parking spots, fitness room, I'm 45 years old married with 2 children. The reason I'm renting the apartment is that I'm relocating with my job in another country and I already signed the contract that will be for the next 4 years. Everything in the apartment is new so there will be no need for repairs. The only problem is that I need to send you the keys and papers because it is a private property.I'm sure we can make this happen. 

 
 
&gt;Regards

&gt;John

&gt;Hello

&gt;    Thank you for your reply. As I told you before the rent for 1 month will be 800CAD and damage deposit 400CAD  with no extra fees and you will have full access to all the amenities of the building. The price will not increase  for the whole period that you will stay there. I would also like to know how many people will live in the apartment and also which rental contract do you prefer- 6 months rental contract with option of renewal or 1 year rental contract with option of renewal. The monthly payments can be wired to my Bank Account (TD Bank) or we can setup a payment method that is suitable for both of us. The apartment is in excellent condition, United Kingdom and obviously we need a safe way to complete this deal.The solution is a worldwide third party company called CLICKANDBUY (www.clickandbuy.com) ,they will provide assistance in handling the payment and delivery of the rental package.  With this procedure you will be able to check the apartment before I receive the payment. Please be aware that is NOT necessary for you to register with ClickandBuy given that I'm a registered user for 4 years and I've made over 30 transactions with them so far. They are really professional and they have great services. 
&gt;My phone number is +442070973803    (if you are calling from Canada or United States you need to dial 011-44-20-70973803). You can call me or e-mail any time you wish. 
Let me know if you are interested so I can provide with all the steps of this transaction


&gt;Thank you and hope to hear from you soon!


Email 3

&gt;You will only have to deposit to ClickandBuy the first month of rent from contract 800CAD$ so they can proceed with the shipping

&gt;1 - To start the process all I need is your full shipping info(full name

&gt;2 - I will go at ClickandBuy to deposit the keys and the contract on your name as the intended receiver. 

&gt;3 - ClickandBuy will check the package to see if everything is in order and also the legal papers that will come along with the keys and proof of ownership with their Real Estate Professional Department in London. They will also confirm with the building manager that I'm the legal owner of the apartment I'm renting to you.

&gt;4 - ClickandBuy will send you a delivery notification to let you know they have the keys and the papers in their custody in which you will also have all the payment instructions to complete the money transfer to the ClickandBuy Agent.

&gt;5 - At this point you will have to make a money deposit on the ClickandBuy Agent Name for the amount we agreed

&gt;6 - After you make the deposit you will have to send the payment details to ClickandBuy.

&gt;7 - ClickandBuy will verify the transfer and if everything is in order they will start the shipping procedures using UPS or TNT Next Day Shipping Service.

&gt;8 - After you receive the package

&gt;Let me know if you have the funds available (800CAD$) so we can move forward and e-mail me your full shipping information I requested. Any further questions regarding the transaction you can call me or e-mail me. 

-----

This scammer asks for a deposit payment via Western Union or MoneyGram to an escrow company with a promise that he will send the keys through a courier company.

Sounds safe. It's not!
These companies do not work this way.

At other times
This proof is in the form of a Western Union or MoneyGram payment to a lawyer

In either case
You will not hear from them again.

If you are reading this because you are looking for property to rent, then it will also be a scam.

**Part 1 - Picnic @ Hawrelak**

Time: 2:00PM

Location: Hawrelak has a bunch of picnic spots that work on a first come first serve basis so I'll go there early on the day of the meetup and reserve us a nice spot (one with a pit). I'll also put up a bunch of signs around the area so it shouldn't be hard to find.

In order to organize food

If you're planning on attending

This is all assuming that the weather cooperates with us on June 25th. If not

**Part 2: Meet at a Pub for drinks**

Time: 7:00 PM

Location: TBD... I'm having a hard time finding a pub for this meetup. The general consensus is, and somewhere with a good, cheap beer selection. The problem is, is that many of the pubs downtown and around Whyte turn into nightclubs on the weekends with live music and DJ's. If anybody has any suggestions write them down below. For now, I'll put my vote in for O Byrnes. If I call in advance I can probably get the back room reserved for Reddit.

The comment

As a city, and they aren't the only thing that defines us.

Here is the text of Spanish_Muffin's comment:

&gt; Edmonton

&gt; It's a city striving on the cusp of the petroleum industry. And being the closest major city to the ""camps"" of oil workers

&gt; Basically, Calgary and Ottawa respectively) are collectively rude and self serving (one might make a case for ""all people"", but this is just my opinion here based on comparison). The majority have either become depressed with their lot, or turn into douche bags, to the levels that DnD Mike could never reach, with their ""oil dollars"" from working the rigs.

&gt; Giant, but always appear shiny and perfectly maintained, as they're only used for penis-pieces, not for actually lifting, hauling, or off-roading.

&gt; The City prides itself on it's sports teams

&gt; We live in snow 7-8 months of the year, at minimum, 6 accidents, on my 15 minute drive to work. Then if the snow melts, and it snows again (despite no snow being on the actual roads) the accident counter needs to reset, and we all need to crash again.

&gt; The city is filthy

&gt; The city floods itself with bars, yet under staffs its police force in this areas, giving rise to street level riots after every major sporting event (thank the great Spaghetti that the teams here suck so it doesn't happen often).

&gt; The roads are picture perfect, without the snow, the roads are poorly maintained, as all infrastructure budget is spent on ""fake architects"" (see Edmonton City Planners) that waste years and millions on through-ramps and overtakes on the few good roads that we have.

&gt; Our famous University seems to the be the only highlight, but don't expect to see any of that money go into your education - NO - it needs to be used to open up more buildings that we can't fill anyway.

I've tried kennels, my cats haven't had any shots since they were fixed as kittens, they are now 3. They are indoor cats, never been out of the apartment their whole lives, so I never bothered with the shots. Probably not the best, I know. I've also been looking for a home for them for a year now, as they belonged to my ex, If the exterminator comes Friday and the cats are still there, playful. They might even end up hiding away anyway since they're only wherever for a day. 

I'm in desperate need for some help right now, so they can't go to her place. If anyone knows of something I can do, Please help me. I can pay for them to stay somewhere, I just need to find somewhere for them. I have food and litter to go wherever. Please, I need help.

If the right wing gets a majority government we might leave the province altogether.,pansysauce,44,20,51,"I wont be unrealistic and demand that the Liberals or NDP win the next election... I know alberta is basically a sea of farmers that will (from my perspective at least) vote against their own interests no matter what.

But for the past 15 years I've seen:

- Ralph klien butcher healthcare with bill 11
- Energy prices skyrocket from deregulation
- Teachers get hosed, and then the entire province 20 years later when they try to enter the workforce
- Oil sands money in alberta given to anyone but albertans
- the creeping mentality that a for-profit contractor is somehow better than a city employee at infrastructure work
- More cops on the streets being the response to the increased crime as an indirect result of the above

Then I listen to 630CHED radio tell me non-stop how the Liberals and the left are to blame for all of this

I pay stupid amounts of taxes

I know I'm probably preaching to the converted

The white van speaker scam is a scam where two or three people rent white vans or SUVs and stock them with cheap crappy knockoff speakers and other stereo equipment and attempt to pass them off as state of the art equipment. Boxes often have a fake price on them and they attempt to sell them at a grossly ""discounted"" rate. They prey on people in retail parking lots like those of Wal-Mart, Home Depot, etc... Moreover, they use rented vehicles so they can't be tracked down.

Anyway, and even seeing a few videos of them being confronted, I leapt into action, alerting my manager and chasing them off.

I called the cops to make a complaint about it and was told that they operate in a very legal grey area and for the most part

So anyway, it was implied during my phone call that they'd love to come down and arrest them for trespassing.

We felt that it was important to focus on quality and with that we do have higher costs than normal asian made manufacturing.

Here's our Spring Release

Also, work with us on projects, collaborate etc etc, we're always down for that. We do a lot of work currently with the hip hop community; However, that does not mean we aren't interested in working with other genres, we'd love to!",,self,,

Although I like the vision of a new downtown arena
  
It's still lacking a $100 million contribution from the province and the City's been told that money is not forthcoming.  
  
**Many people point out that the original Katz Group contribution was to be $100 million
  
What's more
  
Many taxpayers are upset that the Katz Group will get all revenue from all sports and events at the new arena even though the City will own the rink.  
  
Besides all that we still don't know the total amount of dollars the City will contribute to the entire project including the interest on a loan of at least $350 million the city will take out to kickstart the arena.  
  
Nor do we know what the arena will look like. Key elements in the original sketches produced by the Katz Group have changed dramatically. **For instance
  
We need to get back to the table and renegotiate this deal so it's a win-win for taxpayers
  
A new downtown arena is a great idea
  
Thanks again for taking the time to express your views.

Me: I'm actually with Enmax

JER: Bring your utilities bill so I can look at it.

Me: Ummm...Why?

JER: We are authorized by the goverment of Alberta to ensure you are getting the lowest rate for your utilities.

Me: Huh?  Are you saying that you are a government of Alberta agency and that I am obligated to show you my power bill?

JER: That's right.  We are authorized by the government of Alberta.

Me: No

JER: Yes

To me, we are not a government agency, but a utilities company and I'd like to look at your utility bill.""  While their reply is not technically lying, they're not forthcoming with the facts either.

After posting our original post and reading all your comments

1) You people drive fast. Really, highways and freeways were pretty empty so I didn't feel too stressed about it. The drivers seemed pretty good. 

2) People are really nice! The eye contact

3) Huge trucks. Huge.

4) It snowed the whole time we were there! Classic. Actually

5) We got lost in Gibbons looking for some Rural Road # we could not find. That was weird. None of our maps showed the area so we hit a gas station to buy a map

6) Edmonton is pretty diverse actually. Saw people from all over. In comparison

7) We were surprised and impressed by all the green areas of the city. I think Edmonton is actually very beautiful that way. The valleys and rivers are amazing.

8) We saw Help Wanted signs everywhere (very noticeable in Leduc particularly). Coming from Vancouver

9) We liked Leduc and Spruce Grove quite a bit. We drove around Cooking Lake area, it seemed potentially scary.

10) The roads were in about the condition you all warned us about. Potholes etc. Possibly this is why all the big trucks?

So, lower taxes, plentiful work and nice people certainly gave us food for thought! Thanks for the nice visit Edmonton :)

After a few months, with a concrete job sorted!

The downside is its going to be a complex old affair! My stepdad is coming over first for 2-3 months and then the rest of the family is following after. 

The job is in Athabasca initially, and I have deduced that it is a very small, friendly community that is a bit 'out in the sticks'. Don't really know what to expect is all!

Secondly - what are the internet connections/radio/TV scenarios? My sadly ignorant Englishness doesn't know much about the above in other places! If anybody could compare anything to something they know about in the UK

Thirdly - When it comes to getting furniture to Athabasca and back to Edmonton a few months later

Fourthly (again


Finally for now - What's the fishing scene like around Edmonton + surrounding areas? My stepdad likes a bit of fishing

Many thanks for the last time all you beautiful people

In case you've got no idea what I'm talking about
ENTS is a collaborative workspace where our members can come to work on projects
If you're curious and want to check the space out, meet some cool people and hang out.

1354155316.0,13yxof,Homeless in Edmonton,helpeveryone,23,4,11,"Hi Guys, small essentials etc. Someone wanted to gather up some winter items for him and so called an outreach worker in Edmonton to discuss. They let us know that most homeless in Edmonton are quite well known to them and they have access to most of the things they may need (besides housing) to stay warm in the winter (blankets, I don't think people really think of this as something to give. I know that this individual would get several coffees a day from people as they passed him. Which is great but I am sure he can only drink so many. If you know someone who is need or have become familiar with someone who you know is homeless buy them a gift card in whatever amount you can afford.
Of course this is if you don't want to give them straight cash. Lots of people don't like to because they think the person will spend it on liquor etc. I say who cares
