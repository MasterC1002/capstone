So, everybody is rollin’ face and having a good ole’ time when some form of mini riot breaks out in the back fence line where I just happened to be. Cops everywhere and people are getting jammed up. Unsure of why the riot even broke out....I still get slammed on my neck and thrown into the back of the patty wagon. 

Now this is where it gets interesting. Due too poor police work or a lot of chaos the good ole’ “pat down” or frisk missed the 30 or so pills of Molly’s tucked into my sack and now I’m sweating bullets in the back of the wagon because I know the more thorough check at the jail house will have the pills turn up and I’m looking at some serious time. Then DING!! IDEA!!! I say to the other 15+ plus tweakers on the bus “Want some molly’s......for FREE!!!?” 

Of course

&gt;Borax

Thanks very much to Borax for inviting and facilitating this discussion. I conduct human psychopharmacology research as a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. A major focus of my research involves laboratory studies determining the behavioral and psychological effects of psychoactive drugs in humans, and dextromethorphan; stimulants including cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine, and caffeine; and sedatives including alcohol, GHB, and benzodiazepines. I published the first placebo-controlled trial of salvinorin A to demonstrate psychoactive effects in humans. My current research with psilocybin is examining its potential for facilitating behavior change including therapeutic effects. These studies include a trial determining the ability of psilocybin to increase engagement in a meditation program, and a pilot study examining psilocybin as an anti-addiction medication for tobacco smoking cessation.

In addition to my laboratory work, and health risks associated with “bath salts” products. Similar surveys have been conducted in Europe, but this is the first to focus exclusively on the United States. If you have used a “bath salt” product previously and live in the U.S., I would very much appreciate you taking 25-30 minutes of your time to complete the survey, which can be found [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JHUBathSaltSurvey). My hope is that these data will provide a glimpse into the expanding “legal high” marketplace. Please note the survey is not designed to assess use of known, single-entity cathinone derivatives, but rather use of “bath salt” products without knowledge of contents (e.g.,” “plant food

The ramblings of a paramedic.,fischestix,1280,316,539,"I get sick and tired of the misinformation about drugs in this country and society in general.  Dishonest drug education is insulting and damaging.  Without sounding  preachy or judgmental I have compiled a list of how dangerous I think certain drugs actually are.  These are in rough order from most to least scary to me.  I will only comment on substances I have come in direct contact with as a medical provider.  I will not discuss case or patient specifics.  **I will disclaim this by saying this is my personal opinion based on my experiences

 **Combinations**  Ask any overdosed dead celebrity..... combos kill.  By far the number one thing I see in drug related emergencies is combinations.  Mixing substances can have unexpected and powerful effects.   

**PCP** is the drug that frightens me personally the most.  I have fought normal sized humans that easily took on 5 people and a taser with out slowing down.  I don't know what habitual users look like or the down sides of long term use because I have never treated the same PCP patient twice.  The people who are on it do not look to be enjoying themselves.  I have never seen anyone as violent as a person on PCP.  I have no idea what percentage of users react this way.  

**Bath salts** People on bath salts behave similarly to people on speed but with a bit of the disorientation and violence of PCP.  Users have often picked their skin off or have scratched themselves raw.  The neglect and decline in physical health reminds of of methamphetamine.   I have seen this drug cause serious heart  arrhythmias and neurological deficits that I believe to be permanent.  

**Huffing/Inhalants** (edit)  I forgot about this because I consider more like auto erotic than a drug  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;.  You are using a chemical that replaces oxygen in your blood.  This is obviously not good.  I have seen people with brain damage so severe they are in a nursing home from huffing.  Huffing is getting high on a mild to severe head injury.  Long term huffers and old traumatic brain injury patients are indistinguishable.  

**Methamphetamines**  The effects of heavy meth use are exactly as bad as shown in the media.  This drug literally breaks your body down.  I can't say enough negative about this drug.  The things it does to the human body and mind are just sad. 

**Cocaine**  The only contact I have had with cocaine is when someone has a major heart problem, that's about the extent of my experience. 

**Benzodiazepines**  (edit) Basically the opiate's slow cousin (as far as how people present).  Symptoms can mimic heroin overdoses but are more difficult to reverse.  The reversal agent isn't carried by many ambulances because of the side effects of treating benzo overdoses with out doing lab work first.  I almost always see benzos combined with other drugs

**Opiates** are opiates....  I make no distinction between Rx pills and street heroin as far as the addition is concerned.  The delivery method, at least some.  Also, reversing heroine overdoses is easy.  A simple nasal spray or injection of a relatively harmless drug totally reverses opiate overdoses.

**Acid/LSD/Shrooms** I call these the non-violent hallucinogens.  The effects of LSD, just distorted.  Sometimes people on shrooms have gastric problems like vomiting.  I imagine that's less than fun while on a hallucinogen.  I have never seen any major changes in vital signs that I couldn't attribute to anxiety.  

**Alcohol**  By far the most wide spread drug I encounter.  If it's after midnight at a car wreck and I don't have a drunk person

**Marijuana**  In almost 15 years I have only twice taken care of a person who's only medical problem was cannabis consumption.  Both cases were panic attacks.   I have had people injure themselves while high, similar if not less problematic than alcohol in my opinion.

**tldr; A breakdown of how scary different drugs are perceived to be by a paramedic.**

If someone has an idea for me to verify my credentials w/o revealing my identity let me know.  I will answer any questions to the best of my ability.

Follow up to common PMs-- 

What do I think about legality of drugs?  My personal opinion on drug prohibition is that it causes more death and suffering than it alleviates.  I believe in personal accountability.  People are to blame for tragedy, drugs, knives etc.

Where did I work?  I have worked 8 years in a high volume urban setting and just over 6 in suburban/rural 911 based EMS.

How often are calls drug related?  If you count people exaggerating or fabricating symptoms to get drugs

Do I tell the police when someone is on drugs?  Not unless I absolutly have to for legal or safety reasons (children present etc).  If the police are around what you say is up to you.  When they are gone I'll ask again so that my treatment doesn't accidentally kill you based on the drug you won't admit you took.

You are alone with nothing but a large clump of excrement exiting your backdoor

Your thoughts are racing already, or the poop grunts of adjacent toilet-goers, but they are far away, unable to reach you in your now smelly sanctuary.

Your pants are down around your ankles, you do not care. You look up at the door in front of you, it is decorated by the memoires of the faceless hundreds who have pooped here before you. Some are funny, some are smart, most are stupid. If you are tripping, you find yourself unable to decipher whether they are incomprehensible because they are written in the hip-hop-esque calligraphy that so often adorns any surface bereft of constant adult supervision, or because the letters are dancing around in a slow breathing waltz

You gasp.

It has begun.

Far tougher than you had imagined, and a focus point. Your attention has planted it's foot squarely on the task ahead, the thoughts that were previously storm-like in nature, brushing sides with every conceivable topic: The girl, the friends, the night ahead and the night passed by, your life, have now found a point of focus.

""This is it"" you hear yourself thinking, but you cannot keep going like this. As you relax, a nice short log plops into the toilet below you.

The second wave is harder, fast hold-release work. The eruption is muffled by the intense feeling in your body, as an avalanche of brown matter shoots out of your anus, sputtering onto the sides of the bowl, but luckily missing your exposed and clenched buttocks.

You realize you have been holding your breath

That was the hard part, each plop brings with it a short surge of ecstacy. 

You are almost drenched in sweat, you pull up your pants and walk out the door, a hero.

I miss MDMA. I miss the sheer and utter bliss of rolling, just for a night.

I miss LSD. I miss opening up to the sheer beauty of the things around me. I miss the colors radiating light

I miss Adderall. I miss that brutal, playing for multiple hours straight, playing till my fingers were raw as a butcher’s product.

I miss That One Night I Did Ketamine At A Rave, unfamiliar feeling when I looked in the mirror, as if I were looking at a stranger for the first time on the street, as if I were looking at myself objectively for the first time in my life.

I turned 18 last week, aside for the time being. Aside until I get a little better, until my anxiety stops being so bad that I can't make a simple phone call without shaking. Aside until I implement true discipline, until I am practicing my instrument every day... I’m about to go to a very expensive school in August. It’s my dream school and my parents are sacrificing a lot by helping me pay for it so I can’t fuck it up. 

I have never had an addiction, drugs have fucked up my reward system a little bit. Caught up in the magic of drugs, it is easy to forget one's purpose. Why practice tedious scales when you can get high?

But there's more to it than that. Now I finally understand that the only thing that will save me personally at this point is music

Now, while others were knocking back pills, and I got convinced to take some molly although I have an exam 2 days later. It's fine, no worries, haha. Anyway, so everyone does the substance of choice that night, then we go out. I don't feel anything at all during the concert, while at the concert, dancing like I don't care. The rest of the fellas, it would turn into some godly heaven of music. 

I ended up having a blast. One of my friends left before Zedd even came out. It was all about mindset. I went in to have fun from the beginning no matter what. Even before it got crowded and the hype grew

Walk through parking lots
Walked as the crow flies  
Fuck the police  
""If we walk on the sidewalk we are no different than the animals in the cages we are about to go see""  
Probably the most stereotypically dumb sounding quote you would expect from someone who ingested LSD several hours ago to be saying  
But our thoughts nonetheless  
Walk through collegeliberalhippy neighborhoods  
See sign saying ""BEWARE OF GUARD FROG""  
Yes, we checked  
Should have taken this as a literal warning sign that shit was about to get weird  
Pass through what looked suspiciously like the generic wallpaper that comes with windows XP  
Arrive at zoo  
Make stupid comments about how there is another species on display at the zoo that is walking all over the place (humans)  
Stressful navigating through the herds of families  
Notice the flocking algorithms utilized by the family units moving about  
See animals and shit  
They look like alien creatures walking on a foreign planet  
Thought the flamingos were plastic lawn ornaments till I saw one move its head  
Watching buffalo  
Looking in amazement at its enormous
It suddenly begins shitting hilariously  
I bust out laughing which causes a bunch of little children around me to start giggling  
Feel I've crossed everything off on my zoo todo list  
We begin heading out  
Annoyed because stuck behind slow moving ghettoswagwhiteboiwithshinyearings and his unattractive girlfriend  
You can have swag
Finally get out of zoo  
See old lady being helped up a curb by family members  
Oh wait
That old lady is clutching her heart and falling over and maybe dying possibly I don't know what is going on  
Fat guido looking woman holding the old lady screams something to family  
Family along with everyone else just keep looking at old lady gape mouth'd  
Several people call out ""someone call 911""  
I promptly decide to veto experiencing this situation anymore and walk away  
Made my way through the crowd in my very tasteful
Takes a good 30+ seconds for anyone to noticibly call 911  
Feel like I'm in a psychology textbook's hypothetical situation illustrating the bystander effect  
Get bizarre acid image of myself as Michael Corleone walking away from the scene of the murder in the Godfather  
Feel guilty over not being able to help because we were dumb and on acid  
Rough road of thought to travel down when lost in the forest of LSD  
Branch this line of thought and start a new path  
Try to piece together with J what happened  
""We saw the circle of life""  
""Funny thing
Walk by J's actual birthplace  
Hospital looks completely empty and abandoned for no apparent reason  
Maybe there weren't many sick people today  
Walk to the lake in the finally beautiful spring weather  
Enjoy the fucking shit out of the cool ass breeze and nature shit going on around here  
Sit on rocks by small ragged docks  
Watch waves on lake  
Think of how often the abstract concept of wave shows up  
Water waves  
Sound waves  
Radio waves  
Even though we consist of particles
We are just waves knocking up against each other in the 4 dimensional ocean we call the universe  
But within, like the ones traversing the 2D plane of water in front of me  
Waves, everything seems to be tying together today, almost uncomfortably so  
""WTF though did we actually see an old lady die though seriously wtf""  
Continually frustrated/slightly frightened while attempting to integrate the experience of watching someone die into my own memory
J's not very phased by any of this though  
We watch in awe as an enormous fish undulates through the water in front of us  
J says this moment is the most memorable of the day  
J says some zen like things about appreciating small individual experiences and living in the moment  
We chat about dumb life stuff on walk home  
We have a maximum number of fucks we can give each day  
Our job is just to distribute them as optimally as we can  
But give a fuck about your family

I learned of a term that I had never heard before called ""dusting"".  People who were members of ""the family"" supposedly used powder / crystal LSD and blew it into people's faces as a form of punishment when they fucked one of their own over

I just want to point something out before everyone reads this.  I never really felt 100% comfortable with the story that you are about to read.  I never had contemplated using LSD in this manor before.  My WHOLE goal in life was to spread the beauty of LSD when I was younger.  I wanted everyone to have the kinds of beautiful and mind melting experiences that I had; I never wanted to hurt anyone.  The actions in the following story were not pre-meditated.  With that

A friend and I were selling liquid L at a rave somewhere between 1997-98. We never worried about a THING when carrying around $3000 in cash in our pockets at these events. Bringing in 10 vials was never even thought of as dangerous or risky thing to do.  I mean, they normally just did a light pat down for weapons on the regulars.  People DID get caught with vials and big bags of E at the door every weekend though; they were just put into the back of a cop car, they took the drugs, and let them go and told them to never come back. The police even made walks-throughs during the parties about once an hour, but as long as they didn't see you making deals they didn't bother you. As far as people getting jacked for drugs / money, it just wasn't going on in those days.

One night my friend had just finished selling a vial for me and he met me in the back of the drum n bass room to count out my money and receive another vial. All of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw these 4 GIANT Samoan guys that I had seen once before. These were some of the largest human beings I have ever seen in my life. They were all 350-400+ lbs and they were all over 6'6"" and taller. Their arms were the size of my legs. Their hands were as big as dinner plates. No joke.

The reason why I had seen these guys before was because I ran a night club. One month prior to this experience

So as we are counting this money in the back of the drum n bass room, that's how hard he was getting beat! The other guy who was with them was holding me back making sure I didn't interfere with what was going on, not that I could have if I wanted to. I stood there in SHOCK while I watched my friend take the most relentless beating of his life. I had to go get help.

I ran around the party to get a mob of friends together; I needed numbers to help out. By the time I got back around to the dnb room about 3 minutes later they were gone. I had 15 people in tow behind me and found my friend standing there (luckily) with that signature pumpkin head I had seen before. His face was bleeding profusely and his shirt was ripped half way off his body. Out of nowhere I realized that I had a weapon on me. I had something that had the power to teach a ""lesson"".  I wanted these guys to know that attacking and robbing people in our scene was the last thing they should be doing (let alone in ANY scene

I unscrewed a cap off one of the bottles, and stanky in there. There were fog machines blowing and vision was minimal. I walked up to the guy who initiated the robbery attempt / beating and I tapped on his right shoulder from behind. As he turned around I took that bottle of L with the dropper removed and splashed it into his eyes and took off running....

To this day I don't know what ever happened to those guys. I do know that they ended up leaving about 5 minutes after that. I can only imagine what kind of a dose that thuggalo took to his eyes / nose / mouth. I was selling some VERY strong Silver at the time and 3 hits of the stuff was extremely mind melting.

The one thing I do know for sure is..... those guys NEVER came back  to any electronic music event from that day on. I know this for sure because I was throwing those events and attending every single one of them during those years.

I think those guys learned an important lesson that night. At least one of them did...

Many people on reddit are coming forward with their trips

However - I'm seeing a lack of realistic warnings. Nobody wants to be ""the buzzkill"", but as many of you already know, shrooms, DMT, mescaline, LSD, Phenethylamines - these drugs are not always a direct line into your spirit leading to a beautiful experience every single time.

There is a popular idea that a ""bad trip"" is where someone freaks out and loses their shit, no horrible screaming - usually there's just you looking into yourself introspectively and literally not having the capacity to see any shred of self worth or confidence in yourself. For many, for anyone - myself included -  the ""mind opening"" experience of our role in the universe can be terrifying and scarring. For the euphoria that these compounds can bring you, for the spiritual openness and connectivity with the world, they can do the exact opposite too. This is what nobody seems to want to talk about.

**RCs**: I’ve been lucky and only had one real bad experience, but nothing could have prepared me for the existential terror I felt. Oh, and it was humiliating to realize that I was only an atheist as long as I didn’t think I was dying.

In retrospect, if something goes wrong, there’s very little help a doctor could give you.


**Psychedelics**: Shrooms, a year’s worth of therapy, or they can land you in a nightmare of your own creation. I always tell people the same thing. If you can’t sit still and meditate for 10 minutes, you’re not comfortable enough with yourself to go mucking about in your psyche. The greatest moments of bliss in my life have been on psychedelics and in the sack.


**Uppers**: Having a boost of energy and confidence is great. But overconfidence can land you into serious trouble. No matter how great you feel


**Downers**: Benzos and sedatives fall into the same category as uppers for me, take too many or mix them with alcohol and other sedatives and you might have booked a one way ticket to an out of body experience. That being said, there’s nothing quite like popping a Xanax before you have to deal with something like international travel, just make sure to give yourself lots of extra time.


**Opiates**: I consider these guys to be a class of their own. They are seductive. They feel amazing. Neurologically speaking, I’ve had scrips for em a few times, and I enjoyed every minute of them, but I never felt the drive to seek out more when I’d finished the prescribed dose. But I have to admit, if I had access to an unlimited supply, I’d probably be high 24/7.


**MJ**: Pot is an interesting one. I consider it to have the potential to be either a sedative or a psychedelic. Like wine, it can bring you to a state of greater awareness and creativity. If you experience this state enough, you can learn to bring it about without the aid of MJ. I’ve had some success with this, but am still working at it. 


**Synthetic MJ**: tried it twice, not like being high but distinctly altered. The second time felt wrong. Of all the substances I’ve done, never had I experienced anything that felt like it was polluting my brain. **Never again**.


**Salvia**: The stuff in the states is very different from the stuff I tried in Europe. The euro salvia was awesome, but completely void of introspection unlike the serotonin psychedelics. It was like peeking into a crazy dimension that could easily be likened to Roger Rabbit’s world. The salvia in the US seems weak, even in extracts supposedly stronger than their euro counterparts.


**DXM**: I’m torn, the hangover is a bitch and if you’re seeking the fabled 4th plateau or sigma experience, you’re taking dangerous amounts that could result in permanent brain damage or even death. My advice is that if you’re set on doing DXM, do the research, read about all the hospitalizations and ODs. If you’re looking for a life changing experience that will expand your consciousness permanently, the standard LSD, Shrooms, so I imagine they’re similar.


**Dramamine**: Ever wonder what it feels like to not be able to distinguish between the thoughts in your head and external reality? It’s a lot less fun than it sounds
 

**Alcohol**: Some people may be opposed, scientists, and innovators usually have a reputation for hitting the sauce hard. It brings out our primal nature. It’s a celebration of life. It’s a friend in times of great happiness and sorrow alike. It allows us to let go, and live in the moment. There’s a reason control freaks avoid alcohol like the plague. It takes the analytical brain out of the driver’s seat and lets the primate take the wheel for a while. The primate is far smarter than you’d think. As long as you don’t get behind the wheel, alcohol is bitchin’.


In the end


But don’t be retarded


As a final note, beta blocker, and all the rest. I don’t recommend them unless there’s a medical need. The side effects are usually a bitch.

Video games and caffeine were my first two vices. They gripped when I was younger the same way my other habits grip me now. I knew I didn't ""need"" them, but as time progressed I graduated into substances and habits of greater mindful grandeur. 

Fast-forward to myself as a senior in high-school: good friends, drinking til we blacked out and recounting the details the next day. Making up silly drinking games as an excuse to get drunk. Bugging those old enough to buy liquor just so I could have a stash. Drinking my stash by myself because I had nothing better to do. Failing classes. Losing relationships. Going to class drunk. What the fuck have I been doing with my final year in high-school? I need to get my shit together so I can get into university. 

Oh hey, and before they were due. Awesome, check out this wonder-drug that lets me accomplish my goals effortlessly. 

University rolls around: Fraternity life for me, attain a good GPA and have a fucking blast. A few years pass and the constant boozing starts to hinder my GPA. I'm no longer drinking for fun, and taking Adderall almost daily. Oh hey, I met a guy who sells acid, mushrooms, and MDMA. I wonder how these compare to the legal things I've experimented with?

""Wow, and what I want from life. I can't believe such beautiful things are illegal"". 

Fuck

I wonder what other drugs have been given a bad name...

Cocaine? Yeah, buddy. 

Weeks go by

A few more weeks go by and I find myself drinking with this friend once again. I ask him if he has any more

Hah

I buy a couple more grams over the next few months, just like my video game and caffeine habit were when I was younger. Now I've found several dealers, and a connection for much better cocaine than I've been dabbling with. 

Oh, I wonder how that compares? Oh shit, this is cheaper and gets you higher? Why was I wasting my money by putting shit up my nose when I can just smoke a purer and cheaper alternative?

I use drugs. A lot. But I read about them first. I read Wikipedia. I read the sources cited on Wikipedia. I check them against legitimate medical journals I access through my university's library. I understand the details behind each drug's mechanism of action. I understand terms like ""pharmacodynamics"" and ""serotonergic"". Do I expect others to have the same level of knowledge that I do? Of course not. But it's discouraging to check this and other subreddits/forums daily and see, you have to time to google it. No, you can't take an SSRI and LSD. No, shrooms are not a good idea if you're a diagnosed schizophrenic. The answers to these types of questions are extremely obvious. If you don't have the knowledge to answer them yourself, you have no business doing the drug.

These are also the same ""friends"" that can't stay clean for more that 3 days and it's all because of the mentality they have towards heroin. Blaming it all on heroin isn't going to get you anywhere. I can't tell you what made me change my mind, inexcusable actions towards the people I cared for... The people that used to care for me.

From that moment on I've never looked back. I moved out of my home town to a place full of strangers and an empty address book. I puked

Every single thing I had done the entire time I was high and numb started crashing down on me. I started hating myself. How could I do the things I did? How could I steal from the people I care about? How can I lie so easily

I spent the next year and a half struggling to stay clean, or to sleep at all.

So on my 23rd birthday (January 29th

I learned you can never blame something for the mistakes you make. All you'll do is continue to make the same mistakes and never learn. Never grow. I learned that without heroin I would never be the man I am today. I would never have developed such a strong sense of willpower and dedication. I would never have felt what it's like to hurt the people that loved you the most. To watch them cry on the ground in fear of you. I would never have learned working hard and earning what you have feels 100x times better than stealing it. I wouldn't have learned how to feel again. I would have never became the empathetic

TLDR; To some this all up I'm glad I did heroin because heroin didn't make me a horrible person, responsible, caring, loving, and dedicated man I am today. Admit to yourself it was your fault and move on. Since the day I woke up and realized all this I have accomplished the following personal goals I NEVER thought I could do, and you could do it too!

    Stopped Smoking (ciggs and weed)

Just believe in yourself. Stop using the drug as a crutch for your justifications and I guarantee you life will get better. Take it one day at a time! I BELIEVE IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!

With as much sincerity as I can muster

EDIT: I do not actually attribute my success to heroin. This is what I like to call ""finding the silver lining"". It was just the catalyst that helped me help myself; It helped me by creating obstacles to overcome

Its been fun. Ive seen the posts in the past, not even seeing them on reddit before; I disliked them as a person. I never thought it was a good thing. That was probably the *very immature*, ""hardcore"", bang all the cocaine till your nose is bleeding~Smoke all the meth till the shadows are talking to you part of me. But I see what ive become and I hate myself for it. I never knew what addiction was. I thought it was some painful I NEED THIS DRUG OR IM NOT GOING TO BE OKAY feeling, and for some drugs it can be. But its not for me. Tho I am addicted in other ways that the only possible outcome is very negative. Im going to MA meetings to coincide with changing my circle of ""friends"". 

Im also going to quit smoking in all of this

I plan on joining a gym again and getting my life back on track. 

I think I will still smoke weed but im not sure I even want to do that. Not in fear of doing hard core drugs again

Just glad I have the right mindset now and dont believe there is any chance of relapse as I have NO urge to get high again besides mentally and physical withdraws

I still love to browse /drugs tho. Its been a blast

**First synthesis:** 1938 by Albert Hofmann. Fun fact: he was also the first to use it but did so accidentally!

**Intended use:** Fun fact #2: was originally produced by what is now Novartis and marketed as a psychiatric drug for treating a wide variety of mental ailments

**[Current research into medical applications:](http://www.maps.org/research/)** Alleviating anxiety for terminally ill cancer patients coping with their impending deaths

**Legality:** Illegal in almost every country, The Czech Republic, Portugal) have decriminalized possession under a certain amount.

Anyone I talk to I feel like they are never genuine. I can't relate to anyone. My friends seem distant to me now
Everyone I work with is doing a terrible job

Has anyone ever felt like this after LSD? It seems to have opened my eyes to what the world really is like

I know it was the LSD that changed the way I think. Is this depression? I know I never thought this 'outside' way before to what my normal life is like. I used to think my life was normal and everything is fine. I enjoy having a new outlook but it has made me feel distant from all the sheep in the world

Anyone else have this happen? Can anyone offer any advice?

1352466699.0,12wtdw,A Rave Mistake,e_mote,742,170,294,"I purchased turntables soon after I started smoking weed with friends in high school at age 15. Newfound insight and social reinforcement lifted me from depression and I was filled with eager energy. After a gauntlet of experimentation

Weeks after my eighteenth birthday I attended yet another party. I attended alone, but after I declined gave me the item anyway. Following my sunset mix, I enthusiastically consumed a hit of blotter from an unknown in the crowd. Soon afterwards I eyeballed a dose of MDMA, perhaps in the range of 0.1-0.3, and took it.

At the onset of the trip, and why she looked sad. Her boyfriend was a cop on the team busting the party that night, and she was torn between her loyalty to him and her friendship with me. Struck with this realization, the panic developed very quickly. Unsure what to do with this information, I rejoined my new acquaintances and considered warning them. As I reached the group, I saw the fellow who had gifted me the paraphernalia - he was throwing an empty baggy into a fire. Failing to mention anything I took the cue to run back to my car to ditch the rest of the molly and weed I possessed. Rolling hard as shit now, I violently dug through the interior of the car looking for something I couldn't remember. In the walk from the fire I had tripped out enough to forget what I was getting from the car. So I sat there and tried to think. As I waited for sense to come to me, the mother of the property owner, and she was waving her arms as if she were an orchestra conductor commanding the the fidget house or psy breaks or whatever was playing. Here it all came together: it was a trap, and pipes and grinders and lighters and anything sketchy and dumped it all in a bag. I distinctly remember being so high I couldn't think of the word for 'bag'. To my left

In the morning I woke up in my car and knew it was all a delusion. There had been no cops, or not. Anxiety gripped me during the next week. I destroyed every party flyer I had collected, and all photographs of my friends, no matter the context. Waves of heat and trembling would overtake my body during waking hours, and dreams were composed of scenes of running through the woods trying to hide my backpack. Every nook and cranny of my life became illustrated in the story, and all of my observations led me back to believing the delusion.

Weeks before graduation, but could not name. Despite any degree of uncertainty, I took it that this was one of the guys I was on the lookout for. I feigned illness or tiredness and immediately returned to my parents' home, where I packed sweaters and cash and a couple pictures of my mom and dad into a bag and ran away. For a couple weeks I didn't appear in school, the police looked for me after my parents filed a missing person report, and I skipped around town squatting.
It was this week that I became suicidal. I kept a blade on me at all times, though, and I eventually met with my sister so my family would know I was still OK. She comforted me and bent over backwards to enable me to return to school, which was in another city, to graduate. The entire last weeks of school I carried a blade, waiting to barricade myself in the bathroom and slit my wrists when the officers came to get me.

I began to place markers on time to bargain for my sanity. I told myself that if nothing happened by graduation I was safe. Graduation came, but I did not tell them anything. The end of summer came, and the marker just moved ahead. I decided they wanted to work with the university police to build up a profile on my habits and connections, and then arrest me after my first semester. This went on for three years, the marker moving forward, as I lay waiting to kill myself.

With time I moved away from the event and met a young girl. She relieved much of my stress because she represented a new life. She had no connection to anyone I knew and provided a haven outside of my hometown where I felt fairly secure. I was not without troubles, after years, I confided in her. I told her the story very meticulously, and emphasized my inability to process the event. The weight did not magically lift. She had no idea what to say, and said the wrong thing. A fight ensued, and she retired to the locked bathroom to shower. All hope vanished when that door locked. The years of pent up despair did not unravel, but tightened. Out of options, leashed her to a bench, and soon the police arrived. I was taken to the hospital where my sister works as an ER nurse.

The next week or so I spent in a psychiatric ward

I struggle daily with delusional thoughts about people. Often

First of all, in the heat of the moment, rolling balls with the guy who created me, that promise would be swiftly disregarded and replaced with basking in ecstasy and savouring existence in that short frame in time. Sorry.

As for the story... 10am wake-up. My dad was in the living room scanning a newspaper. ""So... you're on holiday now""

By around the 40 minute mark his pupils were bigger than the devil's balls and it was time to pick up the guitars. Simon and Garfunkel, signified by the characteristic first-time roller mumbles of ""Hollly shiiit"" and ""Phwooar"", he asked me to play [Kathy's song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXZyDtzDJMY) while he laid back and drifted along with the waves of euphoria. I thought about the magic in the fact that as a baby, he used to play me The Boxer to get me to sleep at night, and now I am here, 19 years later, playing him a song from the same artist into a different kind of dream world. Memories of rolling tend to slip away over time

The rest of the time was well spent stroking my comically fat

The experience was not what I had expected. I expected bubbly father-son love ramblings and firm hugs and handshakes

I wish I could write more about what an experience it was, you can always be sure that you had a fucking great time and the knowledge of that, for me, is enough to make up for the lack of memory.

I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia since I was 19 years old and since that time (3 years) I've been hospitalized for psychiatric problems 5 times.  I've spent a good 4 months of the last 3 years in a hospital or long term psychiatric treatment facility.  I wanted to make this post because I believe, but once I stepped out of my house and was on my own I began to experience severe mood disturbances and mild auditory hallucinations (hearing police sirens for extended periods of time and occasional voices).  I began using marijuana and enjoyed the experience so much that I instantaneously began abusing it.  Some nights I remember buying a quarter ounce bag and smoking the entire thing in one night. 

My connections were sparse so I used any drug I could find.  I abused cough syrup as well and ended up in the emergency room twice because I had extremely prolonged trips.  I would usually take around 600 to 700 mg of DXM and completely black out

Things really went bad when I ordered 2c-e online.  At this time I was becoming increasingly detached from reality and felt extreme emotional pain.  I took 20 to 30 mg at first and I enjoyed it.  After this though I don't remember much of the next few days other than the fact that I injested over 17 25 mg capsules and the next thing I remember I had completely destroyed my laptop, was sweating profusely and was going in and out of consciousness.  I don't remember much else except for the fact that my roommate had called the police and I was acting so erratic and bizarre that I was sent in for observation at a psychiatric hospital.  I spent over 6 weeks there and every day I made frenetic attempts at running away, holding my breath until I passed out, stabbing myself with sharpened plastic silverware, and slamming my head against walls and furniture to the point I was forcibly restrained several times.  I wasn't diagnosed with anything but instead was released after stabilised and sent to a drug rehabilitation facility.  It was there were I  started experiencing severe psychotic symptoms and after being sent to the hospital again was put on Haldol, Trazadone, Depakote and Cogentin.  Over the next month my symptoms started improving but the problems I had with my mood still lingered around.

I could say a lot more about my story and I left a lot of gaps in it but it would probably fill an entire book.  I just wanted to say that anybody with mental illness should just be aware that using drugs could make their problems worse.  For me drug use was like an on - off valve

1369150489.0,1erobv,My guide to figuring out if what you bought is really LSD!,WishIlivedintheNL,688,140,286,"Hi everyone

I'm gonna lay it out in a sort of checklist kind of way

Before I start all of this I'm gonna talk a little about test kits and LSD. There are two kits that can help you determine if you have LSD. The Marquis and Erlich reagent (THE erlich reagent is the commercially available LSD tester from Bunk police, etc.).  I've never really used a marquis on LSD, I think you're pushing your luck.  With regards to the Erlich I really do not trust it.  I know that it triggers in the presence of an indole, and when you look at the chart it's clear LSD is the only drug that can fit on blotter; However, I've spoken with many people in the RC scene and it is very common for people to dilute their bunk drugs with a very easy to purchase indole.  That means, that if someone is laying a sheet of bunk L all they have to do is grind up some melatonin and put it in their solution.  If they do that their shit will trigger an Erlich test.

Step 1:  Trust your source

This is kind of a bullshit one but from my experience you need to trust your guy. Always ask if he's taken some of the drugs he's about to sell you. If he has you need to ask him the following (this is why you need to trust he isn't bullshitting you on his response)

1.  How long did the trip last (it should be between 10-14 hours)

2.  Did you mouth feel numb when you took it.  Real LSD should not numb your tongue at all! A few times I've had some it has numbed it a little but if you can't feel your tongue you've got bunk shit. (If anyone says they could ""taste the acid"" it was probably bunk as fuck)

3.  How did you take the tab/dose? (If your guy says you HAVE to keep it in your mouth to trip then it's not L

4. How many did you take?  (FROM MY EXPERIENCE most LSD is layed/dosed out at around 50-60 micrograms

1 dose-you feel a little funny and can drink/smoke as much as you want

2 dose-colors are vivid

3 dose-Things look funny

If any of the questions to your dealer seem a little off or he responds with any of the negative responses I've listed above then you should tread carefully and maybe only buy a few hits to try it out first.

Step 2: Form factor

LSD comes in a couple different forms.  The most common I've seen are blotter

Blotter: There are a few things that I look for when someone shows me blotter they believe to be LSD.

* Size -Like I said above

* Texture -  The LSD on blotter I've gotten has a very non-specific feel to it.  Because there is such a small amount of crystal in each paper your blotter should feel like normal paper.  It should be pliable, as a result of this when it is layed onto blotter the blotter will be very hard and rigid.  If you have small tabs that are shiny/rigid/not bendable you probably have bunk shit. This is because the crystals are much more numerous and permeate throughout the whole paper

* Taste- Some blotter/Acid solutions can be a little bitter. This means you can taste whatever is in your mouth but that's really it.  If you have something like a 25x then your mouth will be unbelievably numb.  You won't feel your tongue, etc til the tabs have been out of your mouth for a while.

Liquid (I don't have a lot of experience with liquid

* Look for the same things I just mentioned

Candy 

* If possible look at the dose under black light. The areas with Dropped LSD should fluoresce.

* With candy I have also gotten a DOx chemical.  The only way to really tell is if you've been tripping for 15-18 hours you probably have this instead of LSD. One thing to remember is that like the 25x-nBOME's the dosage for DOC is 1-8mg.  This means there will be a lot of chemical on the medium (this on is hard to tell besides taking some and feeling it out)

Step 2: So

At this point it is time to do some experimenting. This applies for all form factors. 

1. Eat 1 tab and enjoy.  Your trip should be awesome, or have been given super large doses.  

2.  If possible trip with a friend and have him swallow the blotter, if you had doses on altoids I would suggest having one friend keep it in his mouth and the other swallow it straight like a pill.  If the person who swallowed it trips then you are able to rule out the 25i series.  

Step 3: Make a moral decision. 

If you have bunk shit you need to decide what you're going to do with it. From my experience most people will still buy it if you just describe it as NOT LSD.  You can sell it for a normal price if you're upfront with people. Explain to them that this is a drug a lot like LSD but it isn't.  Let them know not to take more than 2 doses for their own safety and go on your way.

Step 4: Enjoy

I walked. Walked. Walked. Reddit I walked. I looked down



Lo and behold........ It was him. I ran. I ran to him. I slowed. I speed walked. I wanted to sit with him. He got up. I was a little dapper. He walked my way. We passed each other without a word. I sat where he sat. I enjoyed the view. Then I worked up the courage reddit. I walked after him. I caught up to him. I said excuse me sir. You are very strong you know that. You are still walking and you are very strong for that. He proceeded to tell me that he had a stroke last April that left him like that. I asked if I could walk with him and we walked reddit. And then he told me about his life. We eventually reached the end of our journey and he thanked me for listening to him. We parted ways and I informed my best friend if what just happened.  I stood at the bridge I was at earlier and took in the view.  It was beautiful.  Life was grand.  I then decided to go get something to eat as I figured I was coming down now.  I start walking to Carls Jr to try their new bourbon burger because I heard it was pretty good and the idea of food to bring me back was nice.

They had $2 for the both of them and got Takis, I never had enough money for what I wanted.  They asked me if I was sure and I assured them it was fine and to get ice cream or something.  It was like reliving my childhood in a way.  I walked away and one of the kids chases after me and hands me a bag of Takis saying ""Hey mister.  Thanks.  Take this!""  I thanked the kid profusely and just smiled.  I made his day better and that's all I can ask for because I'm happy with life already.  I've reached nirvana.  I want nothing.


Walk, eventually reach Carls Jr.  The very nice girl at the register asked if I wanted to try their bourbon burger.  Perfect!  I said sure!  And eventually I got my burger.  I sat there eating it.  I looked around and took in the view.  There was a couple, a white couple.  Some would call them rednecks but the man was happy.  He was smiling.  Nothing can take that away from him at that moment.  I look and see a black gentleman.  Excuse me for being racist but I judged him.  But then I came to the realization he was just like me.  He was here for food and he was just like me.  I look at the girl that served me.  She's not happy with life reddit.  She's stuck with this minimum wage job and it sucks because she wants better, but that's all she can do at the moment.  Then these two ladies come in with two kids.  The two kids run straight for the playground but the door was locked.  They kept trying to go but the door just wouldn't budge.  They called one of the ladies over (presumably a mom or sister) and they try to open it but then they notice the sign that said it was closed.  They were sad.  I was sad.  I felt bad.  Those children just wanted to play on the playground.  The lady said she'll get them ice cream instead and I felt a little better.  But then they all left......the kids without the playground or ice cream.  I wanted to stop the lady and remind her about the ice cream but I figured that'd be a little crazy...


Then I started writing this.  I wrote, typing this at the very moment.  I copied what I had on my phone and emailed it to myself to continue on the computer.  


I'm still coming down from the trip.  But I'm still very happy.  I'm happy with life reddit.  It's one of the most amazing feelings ever.  I want to say I've reached nirvana but even I know that I have not because I know I'll revert to having needs again and worrying about life.  But you know what?  I'll never forget this day.  That's what.  I'll always remember this day as the day I was content with life,False,self,t5_2qh7l,False,,,t3_1cb4al

**A concise guide for first time users.** If you still have specific questions afterwards

So you've decided to take MDMA. Good for you! It is a very safe

Here at /r/drugs we're passionate about people enjoying themselves while also staying safe. We get a lot of people asking about what to do and what to expect and we can't answer everyone in the same detail so we've tried to put together a ""one-stop"" guide which is both concise and informative. It won't cover everything

* What is MDMA?

MDMA is a stimulant drug which creates powerful feelings of love, talk and dance.

* Getting it safely:

MDMA is typically a grey or slightly tan crystalline powder

MDMA also comes in pressed pills which can be adulterated too. You can check your pills using a [marquis kit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_reagent) or on [pillreports](http://www.pillreports.com/index.php).

* Using it:

MDMA is quite a safe drug but regular use causes irreversible tolerance after 5-10 uses

You should drink an normal amount of water for the activity you are doing. MDMA does not cause dehydration but dancing in a busy rave can. Drinking alcohol, cause dehydration, nausea and other unpleasant problems. Being tipsy is fine but getting drunk is definitely worth avoiding. 

* Overdoing it: (

MDMA is a very safe drug when not mixed with other drugs, difficulty reading, realistic hallucinations, nausea and confusion. If you are feeling unwell and you cannot quickly find a friend, seek medical help. MDMA users are quite pleasant for first aiders to treat because they are so compliant so don't hang around worrying about being a nuisance. Nothing is more important than your health.

* Afterwards:

As your experience comes to an end you *will* want to redose. Nobody ever wants it to end. Unfortunately it won't get you back to where you were

MDMA is not toxic like alcohol so you will not have a hangover

* I LOVED IT

Just like taking too much, of course, the larger your breaks ought to be. Having MDMA as a ""special occasions only"" sort of thing makes it surprisingly easy to use sparingly.",,False,self,t5_2qh7l,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/xihdo/rdrugs_ama_series_mdma_aka_ecstasy_e_x_molly/

This was my second time tripping, who have experience with lots of different dosages and potencies of acid. My trip was on the last day of Bonnaroo of this year, so about almost a week ago now. 

I took my tabs around 3 PM and started walking with my friends into the festival grounds. The walk was about 30 minutes, and the combination of music and people really excited me. I never felt scared during my entire trip. The acid was really starting to take hold of me as I was headed towards Kendrick Lamar's set, and that's also when I think my transformation started, so to speak. 

For the first time in my life, and enjoying myself without really worrying about judgement. My mind was open and I was open and I was excited.

After Kendrick's set, letting in all of the sounds and sights of a music festival. I finally found a good place to be outside of Tame Impala's set. I laid down on my back and started listening to all of the sounds coming in, all of them crystal clear. 

I don't know if this is how everyone experiences acid, acid enabled me to hear everyone's individual conversations, tones, and even allowed me to be able to tell if they were enjoying themselves. 

The conversations I heard were very telltale of my generation, and I could hear their tones, and when people sounded upset, mad, bored, or any negative emotion, they were almost exclusively talking about their cell phones. 

I realized how much my generation has started to rely on their phones as a form of constant entertainment, using twitter and Instagram to share my experiences. At Bonnaroo, however, I didn't have my phone with me at all. I used to essentially live through my phone, always checking it for notifications and ignoring the world right in front of me. In the days since my trip, I've almost completely disregarded my phone outside of using it to make plans with people, contact work, and I've felt more connected to every experience I've had since

The other realization I came to at Bonnaroo was that my life was not as important to other people as I used to think. By that, other people are too busy living their own lives to notice mine. It's quite relieving in a way. It's refreshing, even.

I've been able to be myself a lot more ever since my trip, and for those of you that haven't yet experienced something like this, I hope that you find it soon. 

Have a safe journey. ",self,t5_2qh7l,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1gvgw0/lsd_changed_me/

I spend an enormous amount of my time exploring gray-market novel drugs that were either created and then forgotten or synthesized outside the US and subsequently too low key to show up on DEA radars. Some of my favorite include Bromantane, an experimental nootropic that increased digit span to 22 in studies (up from the human average of 8), and well, a bunch-- but that's not what I wanted to bring to your attention.

Amfonelic acid! Originally discovered when some scientists were investigating new types of antibiotics, stress, racing thoughts, etc. Since amfonelic acid ONLY has affinity for dopamine, it's used in studies of the effects of dopaminergics to figure out how dopamine works in the brain independently of interfering factors of classical amphetamines, as well as to isolate the pharmacological peculiarities of said amphetamines. It has *no* peripheral effects, but it does seem to raise levels of tryptophan and serotonin metabolites to a lesser extent, leading to the possibility of a novel antidepressant. If you aren't familiar with pharmacology

Why am I bringing this up? Amfonelic acid has been a gleam in the eye of gray market legal highs for a number of years, it was discovered on some legal high websites-- and the CoA looks legit. (For those not familiar, CoA = Certificate of Authenticity, the document verifying legitimate synthesis, read: the product is legit)

As far as I can tell, even inhalation while measuring it is enough for a full-on experience, and measuring it itself is almost impossible, because it's theorized to be active as low as the microgram range (like acid). So! If you know anyone seeking this, or buying it, be CAREFUL! There is no plan of action at hospitals and clinics for treating an overdose, and we don't even have standardized dosing practices yet. For all we know

I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up in party scenes soon- so do your research

Like the title says, it’s one of those places that has never left the safety of the 1950s. The kind of city where drugs are abhorred - except caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and acetaminophen for the grown-ups, and Ritalin and Adderall for the kids. I grew up taking my prescribed instructions on reality from television, Jesus, but, always making sure to stay on the rails of civilisation.

I had a little rebelliousness in me: I quietly stopped believing in God, but, other than that, I’ve been a good boy. One day, I had an opportunity to try this DMT (I won’t go into details, I knew a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy) that I’ve heard so many praises sung of from all corners of the internet. When you’re an ex-evangelical and you hear something lets you experience death and come back, well, I’m naive in the ways of the psychonaut; cannabis and alcohol are all that have altered my reality until then, and a PVR ready to show a National Geographic special on the known Universe. I heated up what is colloquially seen as a “crack-pipe” and

Here’s where words fail, exploded isn’t the right word... It was blisteringly fast, I was almost instantly scattered evenly across the Universe, but it wasn’t “violent”, it was like chalk-dust rushing away from clapped erasers. What perception was left could “see” everything in an infinitely high resolution, and I plunged through that resolution, “knowing” more the deeper I went. I didn’t feel alone, but there wasn’t a sense that we’d comprehend each other. Eventually

When I came back I was baffled and exhausted; I think I was pretty sure I had died and there wasn’t going to be a coming-back

The next few weeks to a month were sparklingly beautiful. Follies and fallacies had been swept away and all was new. Everything that had a shape or a texture, this feeling wouldn’t last. I started to feel like I couldn’t communicate properly with others, my friends and family; they’d go on about Dancing with the Stars, the activities of Tiger Woods, what kind of new new new car they were going to lease next. I used to be able to participate in this fantasy, I couldn’t anymore, the banality made my head swim and the hopeless emptiness of it filled me with grief. Morally

I thought I just needed to give it time - I could go back to blaming the poor for their poverty, they don’t want to know, so I have no one to talk to.

I loved it. Meth made me a social god, the sex was fucking amazing. FOUR hours. Let's just say she was fucking satisfied. Sober sex was NOTHING compared to meth sex. Being sober was dull compared to life on meth. I tried going out while sober and I was just bored... almost numb compared to what life feels on meth.

Hopefully your kitchen isn't a complete disaster zone, crumbs have a tendency to turn in a swarms of ants, and fruit can get disturbingly biological. 

Making tea involves a couple of steps that you have to do in the right sequence. Thankfully it's pretty hard to make any disastrous mistakes. Fill the water with kettle. No wait, teabags, milk. Are you making tea for your friends? Yep, they are separate people and physical constraints dictate one cup per person. It is a little sad, but trust me, despite what you're feeling right now, it's the way to go with this tea business.  

If you find yourself getting bored waiting for the kettle, the flat colours and strong graphic design is inherently distasteful. That sugar box with its corporate slogans is definitely not your friend.

Water's boiling. Hopefully you haven't wandered off and forgotten about the rest of the plan yet. Fill the cups with water, that tea cup can be the moon, the ocean, a commentary about mankind and the circularity of our existence. Eventually you'll have to break the trance, but probably only a couple of seconds have passed. You might want to take some spoons back to your friends while you are in the kitchen. It will be worth it for the distorted liquid reflections and mind bending Matrix references. 

Congratulations, tasty beverage. Now you just have to get back to the living room...

Over the last month [our group](http://i.imgur.com/dLyDV.jpg) has tested nearly 2

The results have been truly sobering.

Nearly 100% of samples are cut with one or more substances

Research chemicals, Electric Forest and Camp Bisco contained large quantities of or were completely comprised of one or more of these chemicals. Many of these ""research chemicals"" present very real overdose fatality risks and have been in news all over the world. There were 8 overdoses attributed to tainted MDMA powder at Camp Bisco. Three of those individuals are no longer with us.

An overwhelming majority of tested LSD samples were negative for the chemical. In the best-case scenario, a dark hallucinogen with a three-hour onset (leading to multiple doses) and can last for over 24 hours. Overdose effects include memory loss, irrational and sometimes violent behavior and the possibility of causing harm to oneself. At high doses, analogs of this chemical have the power to change the way the mind works permanently.

What we are doing to help

Testing 

The [Bunk Police](http://i.imgur.com/dLyDV.jpg) deploys an array of chemical reagent tests to identify substances and cutting agents. These tests, pill or paper contains. We can test for well over 20 chemical compounds and we are constantly trying to expand our knowledge and capacity to test. The testing equipment that we use at our campsite is the same as Dancesafe.org has been using for over a decade. In addition to these standard tests, we also have the same tests that are used by the State Department, DEA and many EMTs.

Mobile Testing Centers 

In addition to a stationary camp

Outreach Program 

We are able to identify substances in most cases

Information Sessions 

I personally conduct a brief information session every day of each event on the changing substance market and drug identification. I will cover the methods used to disguise dangerous cutting agents and how to know what you’re taking is real
Ents, kindest people and some of the most twisted, greedy and evil souls that this world holds.

If you believe in our cause

1) Legal advice

2) Advice on becoming a nonprofit

3) Help in constructing a website

4) Help in advertising online

5) Help in manufacturing and shipping test kits

6) Help at events

7) Financial advice

My partner in this operation is heading back home to his family

Yeah

Basically, all soggy and shit, and swallowed it all whole. Now, from this point on, I have no idea how much time passed, how long it took to kick in, how long it lasted, I just had no semblance of time

I had intense euphoria, but it was amazingly pleasureable, like an orgasm, I don't know, but yeah, this was amplified greatly. This... I think was on the come up, I actually kind of remember the time of this bit, language didn't make sense, I think I experienced what most people call ego death, I lost all sense of being

The first time, and he wouldn't wake up."" I'm normally really cold and emotionless, but this fucking broke me. I hadn't cried in years about anything, and I had to leave the room every time she said it to sob uncontrollably. After composing myself, I would go back out and color with her and take her out to the swimming pool for as long as I could hold the tears back. 

I took my brother out to eat a day or two after that, I looked him straight in the face and calmly said, ""Don't give me that shit, dude. I don't ever want to hear your daughter say 'my daddy wouldn't wake up' ever the fuck again."" He broke down too, and said ""You're right.""

He immediately started doing better. He's prescribed the pain pills for his back injury, his dad died in the hospital due to multiple organ failure from decades of alcoholism and drug abuse. We went up there to see him before he died, but he was unconscious the whole timer. Despite his dad being kind of a deadbeat asshole, my brother didn't take it very well. He wanted to act like he didn't care, but it was obviously hurting him. He started over-medicating again afterward.

He came over two days ago asking if I knew anyone who needed some pain pills

Here is my story, please read this, for everyones sake.",650," **First off, I know everything that happened to me is partially my fault.** Trusting someone from a certain subreddit and disobeying Reddit policy was a stupid thing to do; and being naive didn't help too much either. Oh and one more thing

***Her Reddit name is /u/MeowKitty420...I know her real name and address as well

 Anyhow, you don't have to abide by it. So, a couple months ago I'm on a subreddit and come across a link asking where people live. I state where I'm from and come across a couple friendly redditors who live in my area. One, a girl (who even sent me a picture with her name and etc, so I'd know it was her) says that she gets scripts and has them all the time etc, and could get them for cheap. She tells me where exactly in my state she's from and I'm kind of put off by the 2 hour drive difference, so I put off seeing her for awhile. As time goes by we start talking more, about how she got beat and how she would never be able to do that to someone nor ever has. I start to think she's a decent enough person and maybe I should give her a chance. Well, she was worried about w/d and her dads pain

 So after a couple more days she coaxes me into meeting up with her. I drive two hours to meet her at a convenience store near her house and give her the money. I asked her for something for collateral, something physical to hold onto so I knew she would come back. She says she ""doesn't have any jewelry and wont give me her ipad cause it's more expensive than the amount I'm giving her"". So she offers me her fucking bong, so of course I don't want to be waiting for her with paraphernalia so I just ask for her home address. She gives it to me and I hand her the money. She then tells me she's going to the pharmacy now and she'll be back in ten minutes; I was to wait in a near buy parking lot. So as I wait I text her to see what's up and eventually 4 hours go buy and she keeps saying ""the pharmacy wont give her dad the script until they check with his insurance"". It eventually gets late and she tells me to go home, she'll come by my place in the morning when she gets it and not to worry. I, stupidly, believe her and go home and wait.

  The next day I text her, but I'll have to meet closer to her this time. So the next day my brother (he put up some of the dough) and I go for an hour drive to meet her at this random mall that's halfway between each of our homes. Hours go by with her constantly repeating ""I'll be there really soon""(sound familiar?); my brother and I are really fed up by this point and begin to call her out on her shadiness. She responds with hostility, saying ""I'm fucking coming, do you want this shit or not, I don't have to do this for you, I could just fuck you over!"". Anyhow, another two hours go by and I get a text from her telling me she's incredibly sorry and busy with her father. Then tells me that we should go home and ONCE AGAIN says she would come to me later that night when she was ready. My brother and I wait all night

  Eventually, just in case she has trouble finding it. I text her, asking if she's dropped it off. She says yes (why didn't she fucking text me?), so I go outside to my mailbox and check.......what do you know? NOTHING IS THERE. She claimed that she put the pills in a plastic bag, hanging on my mailbox flag. I searched that thing and the surrounding area pretty damn thoroughly and nothing, I mean NOTHING, was inside/fell out of the bag. I begin to get a bit heated now and say some nasty things. She responds furiously, even though I know none of this is my fault and she's a fucking liar. She never comes by, I text her a couple of times and hear nothing back. This was the last time we spoke

   *****edit Once she saw the first version of this post, saying she owed some ""tough mexican guy"" money and what she did was so wrong. In a confessing tone, though probably lying, she says she really did have them the second time but her friend changed their mind about fronting her. Anyway, Monday rolls around and of course no text, eventually she says she didn't get it right the first time and it was supposed to be wednesday. Well, to say the least, as expected. She called crying, I just want to make things right"" about a thousand times. There's something wrong with this young woman and I hope she gets the help she needs before she fucks with the wrong person or something much worse.

 So Reddit

The fact that she took my good nature for granted so many times just really makes me think how lost some people really can be. I am a strong believer in Karma and I know (and even hope

Probably that's why I tried a lot of other drugs, always properly. But not alcohol, even when I was a bartender.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago, I really had a lot of fun, it was perfect setting. The high was very weird, I would say it was as sharp as LSD can be, but much clearer. I though't I'm really really focused and not really drunk as I would expect it, alcohol always gave me impression that it makes you slobby and slow, but no it was opposite of that. Probably the scariest thing about it though is - I'm quite confident person, so I'm pretty brave when sober, I dominated the dance floor and was chatted up

And then we went back home, it's usually as we both let the steam out like that, then we hug and move on with our day. But arguing on alcohol is soooooooo... intense, I had no control over my emotions at all, and they felt.... goood! It's really scary and if I'm anything like the average person giving people free access to this drug is the stupidest thing ever. It actually makes agression and rage feel good. No other drug ever made me feel like that, and it scared the shit out of me the next day. 

Plus it has the most terrible come down of anything I ever tried. I actually prefer amphetamine come downs to this because I can smoke weed and feel fine, and out of any energy. Considering I'm pretty fit, I haven't felt that weak and hopeless for a very very long time.

To summarise, but the risk and reducing emotion management, plus very very hard come down make's it totally not worth it and makes me think why the hell people do this to themselves. I would say MDMA is far better alternative for the same type of social drug, atleast it's very simliar, and if you are carefull with it and doing it only sporadically there are no side effects at all, emotional issues are on the other side of the spectrum and it feels so much better.

Hi everyone

My best friend of 25 years, and he took too fucking much and he's gone. It seems like there's at least one post like this a week, but all the cliches that are easy to brush off come into sharp, sharp relief when the shit hits the fan. 

Everyone says the same thing when something like this happens, please* be careful and be safe. Chris said the same fucking thing to me and all of our friends last year when he found his roommate dead of a cocaine overdose. It was a huge head-check, and he personally implored certain friends who are/were hitting the coke too hard to *be careful and be safe*. We're not invincible and we never were. Now the goddamn guy who never left my side since we were 7 years old is a fucking corpse for the *SAME FUCKING REASONS*. 

I don't do any drugs beyond weed and booze these days, but scattered opiates I'd tried had made me feel really sick, and there's a family history with heroin). 

Anyway, shrugged my shoulders and just told her, ""Uncle Chris took too much of a bad drug. It was an accident. Drugs themselves aren't good or bad, and doing a drug doesn't make someone a good or bad person. It's about the choices we make. A lot of people, most people perhaps, take some sort of drug almost every day...coffee, beer, Tylenol

She grasped the concept of drugs and addiction immediately, nor do I want to use scare tactics and imply that every drug is bad and will kill you. She really understood, and in retrospect I'm really glad I was able to say those things to her, because it won't be very long before she's offered a cigarette, a beer, a joint, whatever. And I want her to have a real

Which brings me to you guys and /r/drugs itself. This community is absolutely incredible, and I wouldn't be surprised in the least if it has helped save lives at some point. When Chris and I were growing up and started to get into drinking booze and smoking pot, around the age of 17, resources like this simply did not exist. Neither of us even had regular access to the internet, which itself was in its relative infancy at the time. Thus, we approached drugs with a fairly casual, loose attitude. The idea of having a testkit, doing any research into any given drug just never crossed our minds. We found Erowid just after high school, even when we started trying harder things like ecstasy and coke

I'm sick of seeing the same information that is EASILY found in any sidebar or within 5 minutes of typing Erowid's URL. 

I can see someone asking something along the lines of ""Trying (new substance) and wondering what activities may be unexpectedly awesome"" or something along 5e lines of that....  but asking what to expect when you're dropping L for the first time is redundant and ruining our awesome druggit community.

1370581321.0,1fueqb,Methamphetamine - My understanding so far,clockworkworks,518,94,147,"When I was in my teens and alcohol wasn't really cutting it anymore, everything bar ""Meth"". 

3 months ago we were after some go-ey but to no avail, we got it and collected a glass flume from a dodgy shop across town. I obviously had heard about its dangers, but never really bothered with it as I was content with our usual supply. Anyway, We lit the bowl, felt the hit laughed and continued chugging for most the night (surprisingly). 

To be fair, a few weeks later I had had a hard day at work also hungover from the night before. We were going to a gig uptown but i was clearly not in the mood, my friend told me he got some more of ""the stuff"". I imagined nothing could liven me up at that stage, I blazed the bowl and took the hit........THIS was the exact moment I knew the true power of this stuff, I was back to normal.. 3 meals, 8 hours sleep in a few puffs. So, this is where I learnt that people who underrate it have not been in the situation in where it throws a hook in your brain

Methamphetamine is a sneaky piece of shit

Me and my GF found that we were both ten times funnier when we were on it, we have good jobs and we know to keep it separate.  It was about two weeks ago that I realized we always had a stash in the house now at all times. How has this happened? It was only supposed to be a one off purchase for a rave. My GF admitted she had sometimes snook a few puffs before the cleaning, and thinking about it I had also snook a few tokes now and again. It was only until today, right now, that i realized this dirty drug has snook up and got me as i had skipped a friends birthday party to get high and surf Reddit. 

The point to this is that, it'll find a similarity and use that as a hook on you. Money wont matter, I moaned at a 120 food bill, but dont blink an eye paying 350 for a stash. It tricks your mind and it will fuck you over. 

Beware


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great comments.. Didn't even expect a response. This has actually been extremely constructive and was great relating to other people. So what now? not entirely sure, maybe ill look into doing something similar, I really dont know. All i know is its time to drop the anchor before I hit the falls, and get the fuck of this boat!

1365005192.0,1blesm,One year of stimulants in college. My thoughts and advice...,,498,78,165,"I am 20 now and am studying Chemistry (BS) in college. Over the last summer I obtained a script for amphetamines which I have successfully been using to raise my grades. I believe that I do have some degree of ADHD


1. Adderall is addictive

2. Most doctors that i've seen do not believe people who have ADHD are even capable of getting high from their meds. This leads to somewhat reckless prescribing of stims.

3. The most amphetamine the average person can take in a sustainable manner is around 50mg. Note: ""the average person"". Your mileage may vary.

4. If you are taking amphetamines you would probably be better off with total abstinence from caffeine and tobacco. I get a lot more out of my script by doing this, and get much better quality of sleep.

5. All the amphetamine in the world doesn't mean jack shit if you don't get at least 6 hours of sleep and 2 solid meals per day. Minimum. You'll feel better the more sleep and food you get. I try to get a solid 8 or 9 hours of sleep and munch all day.

6. Don't pull all nighters, and in general fuck shit up.

7. Amphetamines will, but not entirely. Do not try to compensate by upping the dose. Doing so will just make the problem worse. Instead, you're just gonna have to learn to do shit that you don't want to.

8. If you have trouble sleeping

9. You won't always feel like eating but you have to. A good way to get your calories when you don't feel like eating is by drinking whole milk and eating cliff bars. Beef jerky, juice, shakes, and gatorade are good ways to get calories as well.

10. Take whatever vitamins you feel is appropriate, one vitamin C tab, one Omega-3 supplement, and two iron supplements in the morning (I have low blood-iron). I take melatonin and magnesium before bed (both help a tad with sleep).

11. Stimulants can make switching between tasks very difficult. It will always be ""one more second/game/flashcard/whatever"". Learn how to watch out for this and always think ""what am I doing right now

12. If you cannot moderate yourself with your own meds

13. This one is an opinion, vyvanse also lasts all day without the up/down bipolar feeling of adderall, and it ends with a much milder comedown. The fact that vyvanse only uses dextroamphetamine as opposed to levoamphetamine supposedly means more dopamine is released compared to epinephrine and norepinephrine. I believe this reduces the stressed out feelings I get from adderall. Finally, less people ask you for vyvanse yet it is worth much more.

14. Stay hydrate. Try to use water fountains.

15. Stimulants can take away the ""gross

16. Try not to mix booze with stims. It will fuck with your head if you do it to much and/or too hard.

17. Do not take stimulants everyday for an unending period. I personally need at least one day off per week to recharge

18. To elaborate about the consequences of not getting enough sleep... with enough stimulants you would be hard pressed to feel tired or miss class. You can make yourself feel fine even when you have only a couple hours of sleep per night. You won't notice until afterwards, truly don't care about, and then you barely even remember what you learned during your obsession. Stay the fuck away from this place, it takes a toll on your body, mind, and relationships and it is why my girlfriend now distributes my meds to me.

19. Smoking on amphetamines causes synergistic addiction to both cigs and amps. Try to stay away from here.

20. On the flip side

21. It is very easy to make mistakes like spending all your time making flashcards and no time learning the flashcards.

22. Smoking too much weed with amps can hurt (maybe damage) your heart. Pay attention to it while blazing on stims.

23. More sleeping advice on stims. Eat a big meal before bed, get a wide bed so you can stretch and not wake up you SO, try to do pushups/situps/run/ect around 6pm, keep the room dark, try melatonin - it helps a little, keep hydrated and well fed, and finally try taking a shower if you can't sleep. Start out with a cool shower

22. In a pinch


Thats all I can think of for now folks

I had a death wish that shrooms cured. In high school and all of college I was goth. I wore nothing but black for about a decade (actually I'm wearing all black as I write this) I was also obsessed with death. I found the concept fascinating and the act very desirable. I found joy and happiness in my life and accomplished a lot of really cool things. I traveled, friends, an SO, and was really smart. But none of that changed that I wanted to die. I wasn't necessarily suicidal, I didn't want to kill myself, but if I was to get hit by a bus or fall of a cliff snowboarding, than fuck yeah. I don't even really believe in an afterlife. I wasn't looking to get to heaven or have some transcendental experience, to go to sleep and never wake up. All the ""fun"" I got out of life never overcame the day in day out stress and expenditure of energy required to keep living. Anyway I took shrooms once in my life (really damn hard to get a hold of in my circles) During that trip I had an epiphany. I met God (happens a lot on my trips) and he explained to me why living is better than dying and what an amazing opportunity life is. After sobering up, but that day alleviated my desire to die. That was nearly three years ago. I've had those feelings again rarely over the last year but never anything as strong as before

8. Lastly, and consider having a ""sitter."" Do exhaustive research on both Wikipedia and Erowid before trying anything. Learn some pharmacology: even a basic background in pharmacology, and which drugs bind to which receptors, can yield massive benefits on which substances are safe or unsafe to mix with others, or any prescription or OTC medicines you may be taking.

**EDIT:** Okay so there may or may not be some inaccuracies in my post but I am telling you that following the advice I have given has always worked for me. I have never once gotten in trouble from following these tips, this is not hard-and-fast legal or medical advice.

wtf nothing is happening

colors gradually start to become stronger

trying to avoid glancing at people

starting to get anxious

don’t want to freak out in the middle of the fucking beach

look at clouds

clouds look like faces

it’s mom and dad


look away from the sky

footprints in sand look like screaming faces of hungry ghosts

look back at sky

mom’s face is full of pain and dad’s face is wrathful

mfw I realize that guilt and fear (feelings evoked by god aka parents) come from above and push to keep my head down
and rage come from the ground (nature) because they are natural instincts


can’t look at the sky nor the sand

afraid that someone will pop into my field of view and i’ll scream terrified

sit down in the shade of a shack

start talking into tape recorder

i must look like a lunatic mumbling to himself alone


take out a cigarette

promised myself I won’t run home to my girlfriend

need to prove to her that I can spend time alone

need to prove to her that I don’t need constant attention

people walk all around me

fucking bitch girlfriend

need to prove that I’m a strong man

but that’s my dad’s mistake

don’t want to be like dad

girlfriend will think I’m needy and pathetic


if I can’t even spend a couple of hours by myself on the beach then what good am I?

it’s me who wanted the LSD

cigarette’s almost over

I should shout for help

if I’m able to shout for help in a public place I’ll never be afraid to ask for help again from friends


a woman and her child are walking by

LSD will make me scream for help involuntarily and that will heal my soul

the mother is looking at her child

no

I won’t demand her attention

why? not because of the social norms

I have no right to deny a child his mother’s undivided attention


so that’s it? I’m left alone to nurture myself?

this is fucking high school all over again

nobody’s there for me? again I have to be strong?

I’m sitting in the fetal position trembling with anxiety

more LSD effects kick in


perspective grows like magnifying glass

time is slowing down

oh my god this could last an eternity

gonna call my girlfriend

no

I won’t turn my girlfriend into my mom

I should call mom right the fuck now and demand some answers

maybe I should wait until the trip is over

so that’s what it’s about? ‘not now’?

only later

what’s the matter mom? you’re too busy?

what’s so important? what’s the rush?

there’s no time?

time?

no time?


mfw

mfw

mfw deeply hurt and bitter


THERE’S AN ETERNITY TO BE ALONE

THERE’S ETERNITY TO BE ALONE

AND YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT’S GOING TO END AT ALL


*bitter tears of resentment at having been treated unfairly*


even if I would call mom

well who then?

who can be expected to give me 100% of their attention 100% of the time?

if only I could figure this out I could be relaxed

need to understand


why?

what do you need to understand for?

isn’t it enough that I need comfort?

do I have to have a reason?

only myself I can hold up to that standard of 100% attention

and even I don’t live up to it

just like mom didn’t

the nurturing aspect of my personality still doesn’t give its full attention

well now it does


if I don’t dedicate time and attention to myself

I’m holding myself and I’m relaxing

just be with myself when I need it

keep being with myself

anxiety fades


notice the sunset beginning

the sky’s colors are amazing

this is bliss

hold on a fucking minute

not everything is the same

i want to see the effects and the colors of the sunset


horizon is wide

some people walk alone

accompanying each other as long as their feet can take them

in the long journey through the desert of life


reminds me of long walks on the mountains

after a while you’re deep into thoughts

that’s the journey of life

where to? the sunset is right in the middle of the horizon

like a magnificent picture

with a long curvy road stretching towards the sun

home


am I willing to start walking?

alone

I have a girlfriend at home waiting

some people don’t even have that

that’s how easy it is for me to start walking


I imagine that I’ll walk blindly into the sea and when I arrive I’ll actually be back at home

LSD would lead me home though it will appear as a road into the sea

I didn’t know how right I was

I walk until I get to the sea and I start climbing the rocks



I’m tripping my eyes off

but that’s how life is

I inch my way up the rocks until I get to an empty spot

so many hardships to go through just to get a little rest


I sit down

holy shit it’s beautiful

I need a cigarette.. where’s my bag?

I search frantically in the bag so I can enjoy the sunset properly

mfw wtf am I doing?

the sun is almost down! by the time I find a cig it’ll be gone!

the cigarette never enhances the experience

I laugh hysterically and look at the sunset


oh man the sun is so brilliant

it was there all along for me to watch the sunset in its magnificence

while I was struggling with untangling my anxieties

this amazing view is always there for me to see

(and the sunset is fucking amazing on LSD)


the beauty

the beauty is always there for me to see

will always be there for me to see


OH GOD


THE BEAUTY WILL NOT ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME TO SEE

the sun is setting

life is setting

so little time

I’m overwhelmed with ecstatic sorrow

look at the sunset! forget everything


oh man the sun is so brilliant for teaching me this

all it had to do was to look good and wait for me to realize

this must be what meditation is all about

focusing your attention on extracting all the beauty you can from the moment

because there’s so little of it

and because life

where the fuck is my mind wandering again? keep looking at the beauty!


it’s almost gone into the sea

please

and the sun comes back up

I moved the fucking sun with my thoughts

AND I FUCKING GET IT

I’ll take living in any moment from now on

because if I put enough attention into it

maybe


and with that the sun finally sinks into the sea and disappears

Firstly, my family seemed to stop trying to help me, and even I stopped trying. So, after reading about another depression sufferer's success with psilocybin, I decided to give it a try.

The trip itself was not at all what I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to mostly be about hallucinating, there was a little bit of that (walls and trees ""breathing,"" surfaces seemed to shimmer, and colors were incredibly vibrant; it seemed like I was seeing life in HD) but mostly, what defined it for me, is just an **amazing feeling**. Paradoxically, it was the most organic feeling I've ever experienced

So while the visual hallucinations were awesomely beautiful, I had literally forgotten what it was like to be happy, and, in retrospect, that's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone now that I know how amazing being truly happy can be. 

While tripping, while shrooms just reveals your latent confidence that your own insecurities bury inside of you.

Going forward, life itself just seems so simple. I just hope I can maintain this good feeling for a long time.",,False,self,t5_2qh7l,True,,

""I hope I didn't eat too much before this, any sense of self is quickly dispersed and my own mind feels as if a congregation of entities is scrutinizing my being.


""You're going to do just fine. You're going to do.....just.......fine...""

Boom, my heartbeat becomes the rhythm of my existence.  My breathing is no longer under my control.  My lungs fill with as much air as they can hold, and exhale with a great Wooooosh that sends the blood flowing through my veins.  With every second my body fills my lungs with air, exhales as much as possible, and I fall.  I fell deeper than I could have imagined, before my head even hit the pillow my eyes had shut and a veil of flowing light sweeps over the room.  I fall into the fetal position, and the comfort of being somewhere I had been a million times before takes over.  I'm home. 

""Do you know why you're here?""

""Yes.""  Before I could even think of an answer

""What is the meaning of life?  What is life?  Who am I?  What was I?  What is anything?""

With every question I ask

""You will do just fine.  You will do just fine.  You will do just fine.""


My human face appears before my eyes, and I know my lover's.  I open my eyes and they fill with tears.

Never a deliriant though

So I figured I would add to my ""resume"" if you will and give diphenhydramine (Benadryl) a shot. I read up on Erowid and a few forums to acquaint myself with it



**11:00 PM-** I popped sixteen 25mg tablets of Target's generic sleep aid for a total of 400mg DPH. Sat down to Reddit and watched some South Park

**11:30 PM-** My head's slightly heavier and my eyes are hard to keep open. This was expected

**12:00 AM-** Now is when I start to feel it strong. A slight buzzing sensation starts up in my arms and legs

**12:15 AM-** My ENTIRE body is warmer than usual

**12:45 AM-** A movement in my peripheral vision drags my attention away from  my screen and HOLY FUCKING SHITBALLS there's a shadowy dark guy standing next to the door staring at me. I said ""Hi

**1:00 AM-** I look up again, turning to mist as he touches my bed. Fuuuuck. I jump to the light switch and fall down in the process. My muscles are loose and feel like I'm moving them far too fast. The light (thank god) turns on.

**1:15 AM-** With the light on I haven't seen anything else. I decide to walk (slowly) to the kitchen to get a drink

**1:30 AM-** Once I hit the threshold of my door

**2:00 AM-** I've fully decided I do not want this real nightmare shit anymore. I won't leave my room and keep my eyes directly on the familiar screen and let the music surround me. (That's a positive I suppose, frightening, and talking about me. 

**2:15 AM-** I couldn't sleep before this point

**10:30 AM** I wake up with a glass of water on the nightstand next to me, but I'm still slightly paranoid about what I saw. 



So I've learned I do not like this. I won't be doing it again, and I was legitimately afraid of them. There was no control over the experience, no sense of reality and a trip. It was horrible, twitchy, scary as fuck, and like I have now experienced the body load is a LOT to deal with. Physically and mentally unpleasant.

7 days ago I started a 10 day fast. I am only eating magic mushrooms and drinking fresh squeezed juices. 

I am having amazing results and I have documented my journey on a blog.

http://crackediphoneglass.wordpress.com/


What I have learned so far
- Mushrooms are conscious and when you work with them for long periods of time with an intention to learn and grow they will give you buckets of wisdom and understanding about life and the universe.

- Tolerance - I have eaten mushrooms several days in a row. The effects have changed but haven't decreased. I am not looking for visuals, the thoughts that I am thinking, the feeling of bliss and expansion, and the visions I am having are out of this world. 

- It has been 7 days and I feel amazing. Clear. Focused. Attentive to my blog...responsible I guess :) What I am trying to say is that I don't think the mushrooms are having a negative mental effect on me. 

I am learning so much.

1362325610.0,19kv7c,My understanding of how trips go bad.  Hopefully this will help someone out there.,bubblerboy18,412,71,195,"  When tripping on acid, or even think thoughts that just plain scare the hell out of you.  Well if it hasn't happened to you
  

  The number one mistake I made during that trip was trying to ignore those visuals, and instead trying to force myself to think of happy thoughts.  Studies in psychology have found something called the ironic rebound effect by doing the white bear study.  Try this now: Do not think of a white bear for 5 minutes (if you're going to do it, set a timer for 5 minutes).  Whether you tried it or not, you will find it is extremely hard to not think about a white bear, let alone trying to not think about crazy thoughts and visuals.  This is because your brain handles the order do not think about something in an extremely weird way.  The very fact that you are trying not to think about a white bear will actually cause you to think harder and harder about the white bear.  Eventually it will overcome you.  You may ask, ""why can't I stop thinking about this? Whats wrong with me? It can take you into a state of paranoia.  Now Imagine tripping and seeing something scary, or thinking bad thoughts.  The more you try to push away those thoughts the worse it gets and the more those thoughts encompass your trip.  I would say to myself, it's all in your head, listen to music.""  No matter how much I tried
  

  I should have changed my approach to the situation.  I figured out my flawed approach after my recent roll on MDMA two days ago.  I had smoked on the comedown and the visuals were pretty awesome but brought back some negative vibes. I heard myself say to stop thinking about the visuals, I am on a drug that causes hallucinations. Yes, I am scared right now, but it is normal.  I will be fine and these visuals and mindset changes are not going to cause me harm if only I evaluate the situation.  By avoiding the sitiation you tend to make it worse 99% of the time. 
  

  So insted, confront the situation.  The more you beat around the bush and the harder you try and think happy thoughts and to stop thinking about what is bothering you, realize you are going to think about it more, and it will drive you crazy. I would like to hear some of your experiences here, bad trips, how to save a trip that was going bad, what pushed your trip over the edge

TL;DR

Don't avoid scary thoughts or scary visuals. The more you avoid them the worse they will get.  Acknowledge them

is although questionable, or the paths it's taken. Being advertised at 80% one can safely assume
that it would be closer to 45 or 50%. Need not worry as the only contaminates besides half shot low dose ergotamines would be cotton fibers, and well... other 
somewhat natural stuff ;). 

Through the course of this thread (this is a thread?) I will document the laying procedure of 200 hits of LSD onto blotter. The crystal (LOL) pictured below is only bagged for
purposes of easy storage for this shot. Typically it would come right off of the scales and into a solution. Actually that wasn't honest
out of it's packaging into a glass of ethanol. But this is jungle juice and while one should care and respect it

http://i.imgur.com/JZetPuH.jpg

A little setup with the lights on to show what all we'll really need to get this going. Just a simple pyrex dish, a dropper, and a nice
print to set the mood. 

http://i.imgur.com/1I4LzCJ.jpg

So we'll begin from here so bear with me. I will answer questions as needed and document the process as I go. Not sure how I can verify myself other than posting up a signed
pic but I'll be happy to answer anything regardless. 

I am only laying 200 hits as that is what was partially left over from a previous lay. The quality as I said is guesstimated
hits. Yes the math works out to more

Stay tuned! 

______________________________



Well the genie caught up to me quick! LOL! But no worries we shall continue. Of course it's always nice to have a home brew on hand while laying your hits. 

http://i.imgur.com/IROd7u4.jpg

So we add the xtal to 40ml of etoh. Why so much you ask? Well typically one would weight the paper and then know the exact amount needed to saturate the hits evenly. However
given the fact that this is jungle juice, we take the strike/dropper approach. So we need more solution to work with to continuously saturate
these sheets. Kind of like how dogfish head does a continuous dry hop addition to their ipas :) :)

This also can lay to rest the whole ""double dipped"" myth. Sure, packs can be double dipped. Hell, they can be quadrupedal dipped! If the solution is being laid
onto unweighed paper or someone is trying to be careful and squeeze every last drop out evenly
in packs.

As you can see we drop in this nasty purplish green/gray xtal into the etoh. After a few stirs and one pull/push from the plunger the color is quite clear. Now it is heavily 
diluted but this should prove another point. Even wash from several batches will turn crystal clear for the most part. As with any lsd xtal the ""color"" doesn't matter. It can
be lavender, jungle juice, fractal fluff, etc... they will all mostly dissolve clearly. 

http://i.imgur.com/dEAgx3E.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/jrFwcGw.jpg

______________________________________________________________________________________


So we count out our hits and I divided them into two separate sheets to contain the runs. Not a worry when you're dealing with pages but with lower amounts it can lay unevenly.

http://i.imgur.com/px7opmV.jpg

We then take and apply 2ml of solution to each sheet. This takes a bit of finese to not have an over spill or unevenly lay. When dropping/striking do just that ""STRIKE"" go in 
slashes across the page but make it uniform. Diagonal, and Down!!! Be careful around the edges as it will spill and you'll lose potency with enough spills.

http://i.imgur.com/dFuxXpf.jpg

Once it is saturated it's time to wait. 

http://i.imgur.com/uDJRbNj.jpg

This will need to be done 18-20 more times. I give the uneven gap for the fact that as you progress some paper will soak up faster than 
the other. But from here it's just like learning to driving a stick shift car... at first it's a bit difficult and you have to get it done just perfectly. Once you shift into the 
higher gears however it all just flows. Until something fucks up of course ;)

So yes the waiting game... I'll update with more pics as it progresses but not EVERY strike (LOL). 

That's the jist of it though folks. Perhaps soon I will make a shot of laying a pack as it's a bit more interesting! :)

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Well I have more pics but they are quite blurry. All basically the same concept of strike, wait, etc.. However I was going to show how you would deal with the bubble up when laying this way. After your 10th saturation or so the sheets will start to bubble up. Couldn't get a good picture of this, but I'm sure you can all
understand! :)

The easiest way is to not let it dry out that fast, the solution will run off the sheets and cause an uneven lay. 

Here are the finished products though. After several hours it's finished and could have been done quicker. However a more diluted solution makes for easier control with dosage. Not to mention the loss you will have if it does runoff is minimal. 

http://i.imgur.com/fVXPEmv.jpg


In cellophane and about to go into a book for storage. This is possibly the best storage your average Joe can do. While it would be nice for us all to vacuum seal our sheets with a dessicant pack and powdered with ascorbic acid, the dyes for the print, or the fact they used ascorbic acid while storing. The majority of the time though, it's a good rule of thumb that it shouldn't be 
IN YOUR FACE bitter. 

http://i.imgur.com/vy6etK3.jpg

Stay away from aluminum foil. In smaller amounts it's not a huge issue but several problems arise. One being speculated mostly that L and aluminum oxide don't play well together. This is present in foil and even more so in foil stored in colder and moist conditions (ie

It is also speculated that polyethylene (ie: ziplock bags, and a cool environment. This will provide the best bang for your buck as far as storage goes.

It would end up being one of the worst trips of my life. 

I drove to Baltimore (about an hour away) to pick a friend (we will call her E) up from her dorm so that we could go visit another friend (whom i will refer to as J) in Salisbury. Acid flows through that campus like water and

J was dating this guy at the time who was just kind of... Out there. He was super sweet but he really was a weirdo with no social filter. The thing about that

We played music (J and her weird bf had a band and E &amp;amp;amp; I had a band) for a few minutes and then duder shows up with the blotters. 

After a careful cutting session on the kitchen table we were psyched to get the ball room even . 

Everybody doses. I am the last one. I go to put the paper on my tongue

Did I mention that the floor was crooked? Like literally inclined. Also it was a college dudes house so the floor was filthy nasty. 

We looked around like a couple of crackheads but we couldn't find it. 

J's boyfriend

On the ride there (alone with him) he proceeds to tell me all about these crazy drug dealers who have apparently once ""cut a bitch"" who tried to sell them fake acid or something. Somehow this digresses into a monologue about his and J's sex life

Shit is way too real how far are we? i am not on the same page get me out of this car.

A million years of awkward conversation later...

We get to duders. It's an rv parked in a trailer park. We go in and there is expensive dj equipment and records stacked everywhere (cool) with terrible graffiti (if you could call it that) spray painted all over the place. That's when I remember the cut a bitch story from the car.

J's boyfriend explains the situation

A few minutes go by but it feels like hours because everyone is tripping except me at this point.

Duder comes back with a huge fucking knife with a curved/hooked/serrated/fuckinggutyoulikeapig blade. He has a crazy look in his eyes which are locked on mine. Oh my god hes gonna fuckin cut a bitch and the bitch is me holy poopdick what am i gonna do (meanwhile j's boyfriend is staring at his hands talking to Duder's roommate about Freemasons or some shit I mean no help at all). 

He says

""Hey

- pause for dramatic effect

... You wanna fuckin' party? Stick out your tongue.""

A jolt of electric fear runs through me. The light refracts off the blade as he moves towards me and my life flashes before my eyes.

That's when I notice the little piece of paper on the tip of the knife. Fear subsides, he places blotter gently on the tip of my tongue. I keep it in my mouth for a while then swallow. 

The trip only got worse from there. We had to call the cops TWICE while we were tripping to report two separate assaults we witnessed and I got desparately and awkwardly hit on by a stupid guy who was taking hits of nitrous while leaning on his enormous tank (stupid idea # one) while standing up (terrible idea # two). Of course he fell and cracked his head on some shelving. He had a huge bump on his head and kept alternating between ""you're real pretty can I kiss you"" and ""should I drain this bump? I think I'm gonna drain this bump"" in his fucked up nitrous voice in between more hits (dumb idea # 3). Then J was so whacked out she drove in reverse 10 blocks home and said that driving fast in reverse while tripping felt like it was ""meant to be."" 

When we were driving home the next day

I thought about posting this in r/Askreddit but thought it would be more appropriate here. Let me know if I was wrong. 

(Oh yeah don't be stupid remember the Internet is a public place and use a throwaway if you must)

Woah. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Keep 'em coming (and for fuck's sake be safe out there)

So last night I was with some friends and a few of us decided to take shrooms and have a grand ole time. Well a sober friend, I decided to not make a big deal out of it as no one knows that I ever was going to commit suicide. Well the place we went to overlooks the city and I cant explain how I felt but I'll try. I looked over the city and saw all the lights and it pulled me back to that moment when I was holding a gun to my head. The pain that I felt in that moment was as real as the first time I had been there but at the same time I was okay with it. I want to say that going through that experience has made me think less about suicide but it hasn't. What it has done though is made me okay with the situation that created the urge to commit suicide in the first place. I just hope that this first step of acceptance will bring better and brighter days for me. Again just needed somewhere to share what I felt last night and thought this would be the best place.

What I wanted to know was how many people working in the various fields of science have had any experience with LSD and other psychedelics. I've heard stories about scientific discoveries inspired by acid trips and its certainly something I can see being true. Some specific questions:

* Have you ever taken a psychedelic? If so

* Was your interest in science perhaps sparked or fueled by your psychedelic experience? Have psychedelics given you a different perspective on your field of science?

* Was it a positive experience in your life

I eventually stumbled across [this post on erowid experiences involving 3mg of melatonin and one hit from a bong that sounded exactly like what I had felt the first night](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=54295). I showed the page to my friends. This is EXACTLY what I felt. This is EXACTLY what they felt...except way more intense. We've gone ahead and picked out quotes that we feel best represent what was felt. Here they are:

&gt;There was a mild stonning effect, I began spouting playful musings with only vague connections to reality. It was as if my imagination had flooded the logic centers of my brain. I literally could not think in any other terms than metaphorical or out and out fantastical without a great exertion of mental effort. [...]
&gt;At this point my mind was wandering in and out of dreamlike states. I would drift off to the point of actually having what almost seemed like auditory hallucinations, I simply swung on a pendulum back and forth, now almost totally asleep, now almost wide awake. [...]
&gt;The music would change and be some other sound, drowned out by what seemed like nearly intelligable sounds. Small intrumental aspects of the music would seem much clearer and more noticable than ever before when in the more 'waking' states. And let me say again, my imagination was running wild. Images supersaturated my mind. I can't remember it all clearly but there were entire dramatic scenarios playing in one conner of my brain, while quite literally, I had cartoons in another corner. I distinctly remember one about Bugs Bunny and another about a drill sargent. These were easily distinguished from actual hallucinations.

##UPDATE 2: I get it. My friends are dumb, idiotic fucks. No one knows that better than me, but please don't include me in the name calling. I warned them of the risks on multiple occasions. Sometimes the only thing you can do to keep them safe is to be there for them in case shit goes terribly wrong. Yes, I took 15mg (only slightly larger than a normal dose) of melatonin and smoked the first night. I don't regret it, it was nice. I'll likely do it again sometime.

I am posting this so that anyone searching google for how to get high on melatonin will have a chance to receive this warning:

Using melatonin to get high is definitely possible

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT ABUSE MELATONIN FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

YOU WILL HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

About a month ago friends of mine heard about getting high off melatonin. Melatonin is a natural supplement and sleep aid.

They purchased a bottle and set about experimenting. At first each person consumed between 5-9 3mg melatonin. As expected

The feeling is VERY relaxing.

However

In amounts greater than 50mg

Combine that with smoking weed

Two friends were reduced to only being able to slur the response ""fuck haaaaaaa"" and ""I'm chillunnn'"" regardless of the question.

The first few days went without incident

One friend missed his midterm on a Thursday...because he thought it was Monday. He doesn't remember barely anything.

Another friend didn't sleep for 2 days after he stopped taking melatonin

Another friend who only took melatonin and didn't smoke was in a mental fog for the majority of the week even after taking adderall on a daily basis.

My friends range from 150-190lbs and range between 5'10"" and 6'5"" and all had negative effects.

Edit: I forgot to mention that the melatonin was only taken at night. They never took it during the day because of classes.

so I was deep in an amazing complete sensory crossover acid trip and ZZZZZZZZZZ my alarm went of...

I was meant to be at work
So I needed to contact work

So... I had to go down to the 7/11 on the corner

grabbed what clothes I could, and fell around the room looking for sunglasses, PLEASE SUNGLASSES...

FOUND. Good. Keys

FINE I will leave the back door open. So I Go out the back door and leave it open. 

I go round the side

FROM THE FRONT GAH

So I hang over the fence, get inside, open it, get out, then head for 7/11

as I walk I notice time is travelling about twice it's normal speed - which is making walking fun!

The cars are all stretched

I notice a big red ominous smear down my jeans - crap - must have spilt DXM on the earlier


With the sunglasses on

I notice a mother with her daughter - avoiding me.

Another stranger

I feel good

This is where shit hits the fan.

I'm pulling in EVERYTHING ive got to look normal.

Breathing - heavy
Hair
Sunglasses

I notice my fly is undone

At the time this was happening all i was concerned about was getting credit - but now I realise that's not what everyone else in there thought...

I notice now the guy in front left without paying saying anything or asking for a receipt - fast

I remember noticing another guy come in

I NOW remember noticing that she, but at the time presumed she was trying to sell me something under the counter?

It was the first time I'd spoken since the trip started.

""CREDIT"" I accidently warp...

And here I think is where what I thought happened and what actually happened MUST split.... I'll tell my side of the story

""$50 CREDIT""

She slid out the register swiftly, 'just the credit'.

GAH i'm still tripping

Anyhow. at the time i SWEAR she was HELPING ME. like she'd done it before

to me she was AN ANGEL

As I walked away with my credit it started to dawn on me though.

She was terrified

Truffles, of all places, tripped in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, Shrooms are illegal, but truffles, since they lack the cap, are not in reach of The Opium Act, are legal. 

Forgive me if that information is wrong

So, and while there, really wanted to find some weed. However, I'm with my family, so that wasn't much of an option. While shopping, I kept seeing ""Magic Mushroom"" advertisements, but had no idea if they were actually psychedelic, I asked.

The lady told me that they were in fact capable of making me trip, seemed high to me as well) while nobody noticed. I then, at around 9:30 decided to go back to my hotel room and trip. Like I said, I'm with my family, but I ended up getting a hotel room by myself. The room number? fucking 420. 

At 9:52 I decided to ingest the truffles, but I started feeling a little jittery at around 10:15. I was on my phone the entire time talking to my friends in the states, because I as alone and didn't feel like watching dutch television.

At 10:30 I felt the urge to laugh uncontrollably, I was hit with a feeling that i've never experience before!

Suddenly, I have never had anything like this. Also, this was my first psychedelic trip. I no longer felt like I was on drugs, and I saw nothing wrong with the world. My speech became poetic, my typing fluid, and my thoughts very philosophical. 

This continued for hours, was fucking AWESOME. I was laughing so hard and just really had a good time.

Wow, in my hotel room, with some fungi and a Bruce Willis Movie.

It's been 2 months and 21 days since thanksgiving morning, these days, are the furthest thing from my mind.  I just plain don't think about them anymore, and they certainly aren't missed.  Unlike any of the other times I quit, this time I never got the whole PAWS shit where my head would start romanticizing them and I'd start craving them.  This time, nothing.  I finally saw opiates for what they really were to me.. a cavernous pit where my life and dreams were going to die.  I actually moved out recently and while I was packing up my desk I stumbled across a big old rock of heroin that I remember losing.  I remembered how heartbroken I was about that stupid little clump and how I tore my room apart for days trying to find it.  Needless to say that little ball of my former disease earned itself a very prompt trip to the toilet :P

If I were going to relapse, among other reasons, the fact that I'm gay started to be an issue.

I felt no remorse as I flushed it and I never regretted the decision.

There is something that looks like urine in a puddle on the floor under my record player. I am not sure how to tell if it is real or not. 100% sure that it isn't urine... then what is it? How did liquid get on my floor? It couldn't have come in the window... It didn't rain. My cat definitely couldn't fit under my record player to pee... And I certainly didn't pee. Well

5. I need to write more. The response that my little bits of writing here today produced were really encouraging, style. I never show anyone my writing, and it's really good to get some positive reinforcement. I promise to report back about my book when I'm done, put a link in for a free download or something.

I went to Shambhala music festival last weekend (in Salmo, benches, giant hammocks, etc.

My own context is that I smoke weed regularly

But I always grew up with advice ringing through my ears: drugs can be dangerous, drug cocktails are stronger than each drug individually, etc. The idea of popping unknown pills is disgusting to me, and I would never do a drug just because someone offered it to me. And if I'm relying on drugs to keep me entertained, then something's wrong.

It seems that sort of irresponsible drug use was the norm there. The guy in the tent next to us crawled out of it after he did 2CB, pretty early in the night.

To me, fun as they are, can and will kick my ass (and mind) if I'm not careful. But most of these 'kids'—actually just people my age—seemed to relish the opportunity to get fucked up, and only interested in doing as many acronyms as possible, no matter what the effects.

It surprised me to see the extent of it

I'm amazed and want to share my story but due to its highly personal nature I only wanted to do so in an anonymous setting... ie reddit.

So about 3.5 years ago I was raped. It was brutal and violent. 

A few months later my boyfriend ""Mark"" and I started dating. The relationships was wonderful except one huge problem: sex. Whenever we were having sex, which often turned into a full blown panic attack. It was impossible to know what would trigger me... Something as simple as placing his hand a certain way or grunting a certain way would send me into hysterics. It got to the point where I had so much anxiety about having a panic attack I couldn't enjoy sex, so it was impossible for me to get ""in the mood."" I would try to fake it for his sake, but that was physically painful and emotionally draining for me. Inevitably we would fail to have a good time, which led to shame and guilt. Eventually, we were unable to have sex at all.

It got so bad that even seeing sex in a movie or over-hearing someone talk about sex could throw me into a panic attack. I went to the doctor and she prescribed sertraline (generic Zoloft) and Klonopin. I was on that for 5 months and it did help my anxiety but it also made me feel like a robot and affected my personality

Next I tried therapy

I fell into a pit of depression and self loathing. At this point we hadn't had sex in 11 months, and I was paranoid and mean, and not fun to be around. I didn't think our relationship was going to last much longer.

Until shrooms changed everything.

I had some shrooms left over from the summer

We had a lovely afternoon in the park and were relaxing in our living room listening to music. I was peaking at this point

We kissed for a long time and then spent a long time cuddling naked, and I saw myself through his eyes... beautiful, perfect, worthwhile despite my many flaws. Like a scuffed jewel that can be polished to a new shine. Like a beautiful queen. I felt confident, and powerful. And I thought about my rapist, and how weak he was, and how pathetic, small and impotent

We didn't go any farther that night. But the next night, really, since before my rape. 

And we had sex. And it was awkward and physically painful, we did again. Twice. 

Today I poured my remaining bottles of liquor down the drain.

I feel like a new person. Strong

All because these magic mushrooms repressed my shame and allowed me to see my own value through someone else's eyes. The last 3.5 years of my life are gone,False,self,t5_2qh7l,False,,,t3_10shyc

There's a huge live music event outside celebrating the last day of classes at my University, when you hear live techno music is coming round and you're a drug enthusiast you think of sweating your balls of in a huge crowd almost orgasming at the light show.

Instead, so you know you're gonna party at that time.

MDMA, I've made good friends with a pledge in my fraternity who I was not a fan of before, and I've had a conversation with my ex-girlfriend about how we will always have each others' backs, because we've been through waaaay too much together not to. Even if long-distance fucks things up, an amazing person is an amazing person. I feel fantastic and emotionally complete in a way I haven't for a long time, and I can only hope that some of the emotional progress I've made on this great, once-in-a-blue-moon drug stays with me tomorrow morning.

I guess my point here is this: don't just write off MDMA as a party drug. I still wouldn't recommend it all the time with all the neurotixicity and shit I don't wanna think about right now, stay happy, and stay high my enthusiast brothers and sisters.

What I have noticed from LSD since the first time I tripped is the fact that I was completely off the earth. I got three liquid drops from a friends dropper and just levitated away to everything.

I started listening to some [liquid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOX67QP75ZY) and remember being one with the music

I can just recall clear as day that something was telling or showing me that me tripping on this ""mystical natural *something*"" had already happened at one point in my life. LSD wasn't affecting me like a drug

I went to my bed because I accepted that my time had come and I was waiting for the lights to go out, I dabbed quite the amount and after that I do not remember anything except for; ""if the pillows are on the ground, then we can have a comfortable life"", which was written in my note app.
