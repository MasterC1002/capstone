We're 65daysofstatic, drums, pianos and loads of electronics. Mostly, we just try to make people dance or go deaf.

Our last 'proper' record was called We Were Exploding Anyway and you can find loads of that streaming on our homepage here: [65daysofstatic.com](http://www.65daysofstatic.com).

Last year, which caused a bit of a stir. You can find that on the website too.

Right now we're all together in the studio. We'll be about all day, make music in between.

Ask us anything and we will endeavour to answer whatever comes through.

Cheers.

It seems like most new bands have this etched vision how postrock has to sound. It becomes rather repetitive and thats kinda sad for such a beautiful and inspiring genre.

Want to make a difference?

sleepmakeswaves have had an amazing 2012, supporting numerous amazing bands in Australia (including Omar Lopez Rodriguez, Karnivool and are currently on tour with 65daysofstatic) and generally exhausting themselves.

Unfortunately, half-joking tone).

AW: “A few weeks ago we bought our drummer new shoes for his birthday cause his old sneaker let the water in and he couldn't bring himself to buy new ones. Please tell me that there is at least enough in this instrumental rock game for shoe security.”
http://themusic.com.au/interviews/all/2012/12/28/65daysofstatic-paul-wolinski-alex-wilson-sleepmakeswaves/11704/

Now I know there’s so many bands out there that are trying to make it big. I know they’ve made themselves broke and maybe over-stretched if we look at it practically. But this is the band that I love and that I think can be amazing in the post-rock scene with their epic

Underground, with many sacrifices. If we can help them overcome just some of those obstacles wouldn’t that be fucking awesome?




**What can you do to help?**

It’s simple, now would be a great time to get one of their CDs on your shelf or in your hard drive. Have a listen, if you haven’t already and see if it’s worth your money- http://sleepmakeswaves.com/album/and-so-we-destroyed-everything

*Have all their CDs?* Buy a t-shirt

*Can’t quite afford a full CD or got every piece of music already?* You can use the “name your price” option on this EP to donate as much as you can afford- http://sleepmakeswaves.com/album/split-with-tangled-thoughts-of-leaving (insert normal kitsch of ‘if just everybody gave 50 cents”). Plus you get some pretty awesome songs while you’re at it ('we sing the body electric' in particular!).

If you’re in Australia

*Can’t afford to do any of the above?* I know that feeling

Thank you for at least reading this and an even bigger thanks to those who’ve brought something!

Seven months ago,000 strong, so our growth has been pretty amazing. I grabbed [a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/m2jQB.png) of our stats today, which will give you some additional insight.

**So

We need your feedback - any ideas or thoughts about any new features that we can try out? What do you like

-----

Some additional thoughts:

* How can we get more eyes/ears on lesser known bands? What about a ""band of the week""?

**Edit**: Ok

* New music Fridays featuring tracks from 2011/12 albums?
* AMAs - I've got a tentative ""yes"" from Red Sparowes and TWDY
* We need a ""post-rock essentials list"" ([a lot of talk about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/search?q=essentials&amp;restrict_sr=on))

**Edit**: Have a volunteer to help out with this

* The new wiki system will be released soon - how can we improve our FAQ
* /r/Music has implemented some [new rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wh5p7/new_rules_you_wanted_selfpost_friday_no_images/) as well as /r/Metal implementing a [band blacklist](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/smons/on_reposts/) - good ideas or too much?

**Edit**: Going to hold off on this for now

* Did you know we have a [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-postrock) &amp; [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/rpostrock)?

**Tangled Thoughts of Leaving**

It’s like jazz meets post-rock and starts screwing it in hardcore’s bedroom while Beethoven experiments with electronica on the bedside table. Utterly original sound


**sleepmakeswaves**

The big success story of the Aussie post-rock scene so far, dropdead gorgeous songwriting and an incredibly energetic live show. 
Their best song- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZSL_7W5Rqw


**Laura**

Think of a more concise, conventional stuff here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtgMQ8dwIc


**Nikko**

Doom-country fused with post-rock. That's about as close as I can get to a description. Melancholy bar-room ballads so good you can almost smell the spilt beer and cigerette smoke staining your room as you listen. There's a mean violin in there too. Lately have gone more traditional song-writing but their post-rock instrumental punch is still in there.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLiQBnc_hWw


**hazards of swimming naked**

These guys put the rock back into post-rock. Their cinematic and driving songs feature a great dynamic between the two lead guitar players
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiotsbW80VA


**Mr Maps**

Fusing together post-rock and math-rock, drums, guitar and cello in particular. Perfect fusion of emotion and technicality in music.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUPMXaF5874


**Dumbsaint**

Halfway between post-rock and post-metal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me9JKjkBS3Y


**Echotide**

The new trio on the block
http://echotide.bandcamp.com/


**Meniscus**

Their brand of free-flowing and melodic post-rock is stunningly layered and beautiful. Another extremely strong songwriting team too

A few dedicated posters post about 5 new unknown artists every single day. I have discovered pretty much 99% of my post-rock music over there. They of course also post updates on the most famous artists on the post-rock scene.

They usually do very good at finding out if one of the artists they've posted about has created a new album.

Most of the artists they show are just starting their career and are thus looking for a fan-base. This website is a very good way for them to reach an attentive audience. Nearly all the albums proposed can be downloaded under a ""Name your price"" policy. If you feel like downloading for free

At exactly 6:30 AM on April 9th, ""YEAHHHHHHHHHHH!"" Later on that year, I bought tickets to see them in Chicago, which was the closest place from where I live (South bit of Indiana.) I hyped up the trip hardcore; it'd be on my spring break, so that made it hundreds of times better.

Last night, so the line wrapped around half the block. I got there early enough to secure a good spot close to the door (and got to watch a 14-year-old try to enter a bar with his parents.)

After getting in, the opening guy (Eric Chenaux) came on, and played something that sounded like radio static for thirty minutes. Finally, he announced, ""This will be my last song."" and the crowd exploded in applause.

A few minutes after Eric left the stage, the members of Godspeed took the stage. Moya came out first, and the air in the room suddenly felt much thinner as everyone breathed in at once. He smiled, then waved, which resulted in another round of thunderous clapping and hollering. He then sat down at his guitar, and began tuning.

Each member that came out after that picked up their instrument and started playing. By the time Efrim appeared

After 18 minutes of solid noise, as this is more or less the epitome of song intros.

There were two projections being played at this point: flowers blooming

Sleep was played after that. Equally amazing. The films showed flocks of birds flying around.

Albanian dropped after that. Nobody really saw it coming, and it was awesome, but nothing compared to the metal-like ending. If the rumors are true, and this song DOES get recorded, then I am very excited.

Dead Metheny and Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls were also played. And

There were several parts during the show that had an almost spiritual experience to them. We all seemed to be experiencing it differently (two people looked to be having seizures during Albanian.) When the peak of BBF3 hit

They ended the show much like it began; each member left their instrument blaring at full volume while the projectionist played a loop of random images until one of the stage managers came on-stage to kill the amps.

The crowd remained clapping for a while, a tour poster, and a shirt. It was a bit pricey, but I picked up a shirt.

And to make things even more awesome

Another guy is working on a recording too

And so I laid down, followed by The Only Moment We Were Alone.

Wow, examining each sound and how it works with all others, and trying to absorb everything that's going on at once. I found out how intricate the songs really are, that there's much more than I can catch by simply putting it to the background.

I knew the songs really well, it all worked in a way I didn't understand before. I also realized how much work has this had to take to create something like this. Then the climax at the end of The Only Moment We Were Alone came, and it was great. 

Really, for the parts I liked, basically ignoring everything else, listening to it just as the necessary boring part.

I also found out that some songs I liked were rather flat in comparsion with some I found boring at first.

Guys, and really, not only post-rock, but any music for that matter. Listen to each sound, think about it, try to listen to it all of it at once.

Albums:

On Little Known Frequencies- From Monument to Masses.  I've been listening to this album non-stop since its releases.  What I love about Monuments is how all of their songs have a real drive with strong riffs.  A lot of my friends aren't big fans of the ""softness"" or ""swelling"" nature of a lot of more progressively minded postrock

The Earth Is A Man- self-titled.  These guys are unsigned

Easily Misunderstood- Samuel Jackson Five.  Recently discovered these guys as well (thank you, and some strange time signatures.  Good introduction to some of the common aspects of the genre, methinks.

Law-Cougar.  These guys are exceptional, and really catchy.

Songs:

Those Who Stayed - Murder By Death.  Not exactly a post-rock band, too

Pulse Conditioner - Cougar.  This whole album is a go-to for me.  This song is actually one of the first songs that got me interested in the genre.  The song Altatl would also do nicely.

Frederica - Do Make Say Think.  Beautiful song


Runner ups include: Mudy on the Sakuban, Mescaliner, Maserati, Tera Melos, El Ten Eleven, Dirty Three.

Again, Icebreaker, through the UK and Ireland.

The tour starts with a pop up show in Glasgow at 'The 13th Note' this Saturday (March 23rd). Our stage time is 11pm sharp. It's small. It's sweaty. It was booked yesterday.

The shows between are as follows:

MARCH 23rd | Glasgow @ The 13th Note

MARCH 24th | Edinburgh @ The Voodoo Rooms

MARCH 25th | Leeds @ Milo

MARCH 26th | Manchester @ Castle Hotel

MARCH 27th | Huddersfield @ The Parish

MARCH 28th | Blackpool @ Later At The Blue Room (Festival)

MARCH 29th | Nottingham @ JT Soar (BYOB)

MARCH 30th | Stamford @ The Voodoo Lounge

MARCH 31st |  Lincoln @ The Shed

APRIL 2nd |  Brixton @ The Windmill

APRIL 3rd | Colchester @ The Hole In The Wall

APRIL 4th | Brighton @ The Prince Albert

APRIL 5th | Cardiff @ The Full Moon

APRIL 6th | Bristol @ The Exchange

Your involvement could be anything from actually setting up the show to just giving us the name of your favorite place to see bands play live. We will be traveling with our friend Dan and his one-man-band [DSF](http://www.myspace.com/fogontheshore). Below I will provide the projected dates and locations of where we will be, so if anyone in these areas would just PM me with the info that would be wonderful and I would love to see you at the show. Below will also be provided a resume of what we've accomplished over the past couple of years.
