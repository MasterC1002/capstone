Nothing blows my mind more than thinking about things like the size-relativity between Earth and the Sun and our galaxy and then truly massive objects such as that newly discovered quasar cluster U1.27. Or thinking about the sheer number of planets and stars and galaxies that are out there. And then thinking about the incredible distances between those galaxies. There's no way humans will ever come close to even discovering a fraction of what is out there to discover! 

It can make me feel quite insignificant sometimes, humans (and the other probable intelligent lifeforms throughout the Universe) are just a sort of consciousness of the Cosmos. It's really incredible to think about.

1) Everything I've seen shows that dark matter affects visible matter

It's commonly shown as giant globs surrounding galaxies (see video).  But why isn't it affected by its own mass / gravitational force? Shouldn't it start condensing / compressing onto itself?  Does it somehow send OUT gravity, what would allow it to maintain its ""shape"" but if it *is* affected by gravity, what keeps it fluffy?

example of dark matter halo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=PznhzHOtr_Y

side note: while the 85.5%(from memory) figure may be well confirmed, are there ""pockets"" of dark matter more dense (gravitational) and others less dense?

The Bigger one:  For the purpose of this

2) Dark matter has been shown to exist (through inference) *all around* galaxies.   It's shown as a galaxy inside a giant round blob about 6x the size of the galaxy with the visible galaxy smack in the middle.

**But galaxies are known to collide.**  It's my understanding that when galaxies collide, stimulating star formation.  

But wouldn't the ""effect"" of dark matter of one galaxy distort the gravitational ""effect"" of the other to a measurable degree?  By itself

But

Indeed,000 light years before the visible part of the galaxy started touching the target galaxy.

**To me** the first one of these question/issues just doesn't make any ""sense"" but the *second* question / issue would probably be observable, wouldn't it? 

Certainly, and I would think the gravitational effects would be that much more distorted.

Isn't the measure of time based upon the expansion of the universe from the start of the big bang forward since that is the beginning of observable motion?  Why couldn't the matter that made up the pre-universe exist infinitely before the event of the big bang?  In my head this makes sense since it could simply be sitting there and for a reason

As I also understand it, however is there any evidence that the constants and forces of nature could have taken on any other value than what they currently reside at?  Could light have traveled at a different speed?  Could the strong force been any other value that it currently is?  It seems to be that if light could take on another value there would be evidence of being able to alter that value in some way.  As far as I know, there is no way to change the nature of photons on a universal scale.  It seems to me that the nature of light, gravity, weak force and other constants; are completely unalterable and could not take on any other value that what their nature truly is.

As many of you may know, or at least a geometry which wouldn't result in collapse or desolation. Basically this ratio is:

**Actual Density of the Universe's Matter / Density Needed to Maintain a Stable

Robert Dicke showed that the universe, then the Universe would have collapsed in on itself, as the force of gravity outmatched the expansion force of the Universe. In the opposite case, if the Universe's omega value was less than 0.999...9, then the Universe wouldn't have been dense enough to slow it's own expansion through gravity, and it would have expanded *too* quickly, resulting in an extremely empty and desolate Universe. 

Supposedly, duration. Dicke knew that we had, at the time of the late 1930s, hard **observational** evidence for the expansion of the Universe one second after the big bang.

The first quote confused me because it sounds like the redshift of galaxies is decreasing, right?), it just means the galaxies observed at z~0.2 were fully assembled at earlier times. But that sentence seems to contradict itself to me. If it's not the same galaxy (or same group of galaxies), how can the quote tell you what happened at an earlier time?

The second quote almost sounds like there's a peak in galaxy number at z~0.7-0.8, is it saying that for most galaxies within a redshift of 1 of us, they were already there at the age of the universe given by z~0.7-0.8?

I understand redshift is a measure of relative speed, redshift is therefore a measure of how far away something is. How far away it is can also tell you how long ago it happened, given light's finite speed. So I guess what I'm asking is whether we change from distance given by redshift to time ago given by redshift (and vice versa), or if it's just about comparing groups of galaxies at different distances/redshifts?",,False,,False,t3_16wzly

After reading 'Something from Nothing' and watching his videos I am a little confused regarding one of his claims. He mentions that if you remove all the matter/fields/particles etc from a given space to make that space as 'empty' as we can. That space still contains virtual particles, doesn't this ""empty"" space still exist within the constraints of our own Universe? From what I understand the 'singularity' from which our Universe began would have existed outside of our Universe before inflation started and began to create the Universe we all know and love today.

If the theory on causal relations in this article is sound, the ending of the universe could trigger its own beginning, because the beginning (Big Bang) and end (Big Crunch) would both be on a scale at which quantum mechanics would apply. This could possibly answer the question of the universe's origins—the eternal question of, Well, if the universe hasn't always been here, what was here before it? and what caused it to happen?

Closing down these telescopes would be a huge loss for the scientific community!

Not only the instrument itself but it would mean less access for astronomers and the loss of a great educational center.

Here's a few random facts about the Green Bank Telescope:

*No other telescope covers, certain windows to the universe will be closed.

*No other telescope can both find and time millisecond pulsars, the Nobel Prize).

*No other telescope can match the GBT’s sensitivity to the faint spectral lines of molecules in space

*The kinds of results that come out of single-dish radio telescopes will come out of telescopes in other countries, and Great Britain. The US will have greatly reduced its scientific competitiveness in this arena.

*The Green Bank Telescope site hosts numerous educational programs, the Radio Astronomer for a Day program, field trip experiences, and conferences such as StarQuest and the Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers. These programs give students, teachers, and regular-old adults the tools to explore the universe, and they affect thousands of people each year.

*600 astronomers put in proposals to use the GBT last year. Given that there are only about 10

*If the observatory is non-federally funded, and the only thing between you and the control room is the scientific merit of your proposal. In other countries, and on privately funded telescopes, the sky is not so open, and time is often based on affiliation or citizenship.

Other Cool Facts

*Can record up to 800 Megabytes of data every second
*Provides astronomers all over the world with almost 7
*Used radar signals sent from Puerto Rico and bounced off the moon to examine  the Moon’s surface
*Helped NASA track the Phoenix Mars Lander to make sure its landing was going as planned.
*Can detect signals from the beginning of the universe
*Is the largest fully steerable telescope in the world
*Is 485 feet tall
*Its dish Is 328 feet by 360 feet across
*Could readily fit two football fields inside its dish",,t5_2r5v1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/zchcx/hey_yall_nsf_has_recommended_divesting_the/

First off, written by character B, which revolutionizes the field in a contested, bitter sort of way. This article isn't signed, nobody knows who wrote it (character B is in a mental institution. He is a genius with a genetic mutation, providing him with a sixth sense (seeing space-time curvature, maybe?) and crazy-person mannerisms). 

The article shows a) that the universe is going to *crunch*

The article prompts a change of plans for A, because then B could've tricked A into building it before she even wanted to try and survive the crunch in the first place, just by describing it as a ""start engine"" in his article.  

It would also be good if there was a sciencey reason for why Character A and her staff believe that the article tells them everything they need to know to build the spaceship

I would love to have some help with filling in the science details here

Bullet point questions:


**What does the article need to do to demonstrate that the universe will crunch



**What kind of spaceship will it be? Will it have like an alcubierre engine? The story does not require faster than light travel



**If a machine could bend spacetime sort of willy-nilly, but I don't currently posess the language to write it nor the know-how to write it *well*.**

1372214216.0,1h2yyk,I have a hypothesis regarding Dark Matter and Dark Energy and maybe what comprises matter.,SarnXero,12,12,5,"I am looking to get some feedback on this hypothesis I had. Not sure if there is anything here. Let me know what you think. When I read the wikipedia article about the Banach-Tarski paradox

Could the Banach-Tarski paradox have anything  to do with the structure of electrons or bosons

Perhaps the wave like action of sub-atomic particles could be represented by the creation and  annihilation of pseudo-particle and anti-particle pairs.  If their alignment were during their action were that of a paradoxical decomposition set

Can rotating paradoxical decomposing sets [PDS] be what  comprise electrons or other bosons? If so

Is it possible that the action of the annihilating pseudo- particles arranged in a rotating paradoxical decomposing  set acts on space in such a way that it drags space along  and leaves us with 2 quanta of space when before there was  1? 

If so then the expansion of the universe could be explained  by this. Might the action of [PDS] leave exponentially smaller  and smaller [PDS] the further the distance from the  originating set. This could account for Dark Energy

If mass were to act on this new space, gravity would act on this space, as it does, and leave it twisted  as the matter at it's center rotates around the host  galaxy's black hole. Might this twisted space actually affect our measurements through it and may account  for dark matter. 

An example of dark matter acting like a galactic exhaust  cloud may be see in Abell 520 which is a merger of galaxy  clusters. Measurements in 2007 showed the the dark matter  clouds of the merging clusters to be traveling independently  of their respective hosts. I would picture this similarly  to 2 cars with smokey exhausts colliding. Their exhaust  clouds would continue to move and pass through each other  as the the cars hit.

1355890981.0,153bdo,"The beginning of it all. A new perspective. ""The Small Split Theory""",murphy2020,2,3,0,"nfinitely small and infinetly dense are impossible because something else would have to exist for somthing to be a.)small and b.) dense. With nothing else in existance both infinetly small and infinetly large would exist and every spectrum in btwn. Also infinetly dense and infetly light with every spectrum would also have to exist because the ""singular"" must also be the ""everything"". If we hold that nothing in our hand and split it in half (haven't worked out why yet, beginning with nothing! Now these nothings keep splitting
Lets pause and think before the big bang, zero does not exist. If you take a number line both positive and negative, zero is always the combination of two identical opposite together. Image taking 1 and -1 and slamming them together to make zero. We would say there is nothing, but we can rip zero apart and now we have 1 and -1 again. Because numbers go on forever, we can do this forever or infinitley positive and infinetly negative. When combined we always ""see"" zero but we now know that zero or nothing is the combination of everything. Nothing is the cancelation of two everythings. 
Now this is a working thesis so instead of trashing it please help to refine it. The key questions are the split of this nothings. Please also take into accont the obsertity of infinitely small and dense
