In planning my education I've always gone with trying to do something that gets you well paying jobs. But I'm kinda having some doubts.

I really like the connection between social circumstance (i.e. history) and the art that's produced in a given time or location. I'm fascinated by the philosophical and political outlooks that cause waves and fluctuations in subjects and style. I do not

So I'm sort of wondering what job opportunities education in this field or related fields offer and also whether the paragraph above sounds like I'd have a good time with the subject.

The first question I feel has been answered well enough and I am content with the answers I have

One area I find trouble is that of the 'faceting' technique Cubism uses, elevation and section'* in order to '*expose the absolute, and not merely the factitious woman'*, which suggests him painting not what he sees literally in the one scene, but what he knows about the scene and how it interacts with the space, how it appears from all angles, the quality that each viewpoint expresses, describing Braque's works at l'Estaque, and what the Cubists rebelled against was the fact the Impressionists were '*more concerned with expressing an idea than trying to present the world around them*'  and had *'lost sight of the solider aspects of reality'*. Is there not some contradiction in his argument here? Surely isn't him imposing his own sense of reality upon a scene not the same as what the Impressionists were doing? 

In addition, Cooper argues their basic intention was *'to recreate visual reality as completely as possible in a self sufficing, non-imitative art form*', however, I find this supposed movement towards reality hard to grasp when their work is progressing from pieces such [Les Demoiselles](http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/assets/images/images/avignon.jpg) to [Harbour in Normandy](http://www.friendsofart.net/static/images/art3/georges-braque-harbour-in-normandy.jpg) to [Still Life with a Clarinet](http://uploads6.wikipaintings.org/images/pablo-picasso/clarinet-1911.jpg), ie. becoming more abstract.

Edit: The Bison is an interesting piece only because it belonged to my Great Grandfather.  Since he was born in the American West in the 1890's (he had children very late in life) I felt it was a good idea to post it.  He also worked for some kind of commission during the Great Depression.  I am not exactly sure what it was; I know he was payed by the government to travel to the Native American tribes and interview them.  I know that some of these tribes were dying out and are no longer in existence.  The idea was to preserve the history before it vanished.  Its VERY heavy, its rather old, well crafted, and according to my Mother and Aunt, he always kept it close at hand.

Hello,000 subscriber mark. It's a great moment for /r/ArtHistory, but unfortunately not one I can take credit for. Of course, reddit is growing at the same pace, and now there is a veritable cornucopia of art subreddits for the discerning redditor.

When I first arrived at this subreddit, like /r/ArtSphere, have sprung up with similar ideals. With that in mind, I think it's time for us to ponder /r/ArtHistory- of what it is now, of what it could be.

Feel free to answer as many of the questions below as you'd like- if you feel I forgot/neglected a topic

____

What should /r/ArtHistory's goals be?

How satisfied are you with the subreddit? What content would you like to see more/less of here?

Would you like to see a ruleset for the subreddit develop? If so

Should we try to foster a stronger sense of community? If so

I'm interested in museum studies but I don't know if I'm socially adept enough to be a decent curator. 

So I'm thinking about getting a PhD in art history and teaching at the postsecondary level. My focus and major area of interest is contemporary Chinese art.

Pros:

I am a prolific and decent writer

I like art history

Cons:

I am about 30, good for me, I hadn't added it up yet)


The key motivation for what I do is a combination of a passion for art history and a desire for my future children to live extremely well and be healthy and shit. Can anyone here with a PhD give me insight on how well starting a family meshes with this kind of career

I cannot afford to travel to China on my own steam--I would need a job--and I don't feel I could earn a PhD in contemporary Chinese art without at the very least visiting the country. Obviously. So I'm wondering if the degree would actually take even longer since I'd spend ideally a few years in China. 

My advisor offered to get me a job near Shanghai after I graduate--he has good connections. I'm not too sure about it yet though. 

Ugh this is the worst time to have a career crisis. I have to start applying to grad schools soon.

I'm a freshman at Rhode Island School of Design and had some questions about the theme of the course. I was also wondering if you guys could share some stories and ideas from your courses.

Basically it was a lecture series class with a discussion group. Basic midterms finals and papers were assigned and it wasn't a terribly difficult course as long as you were on top of things. 

We did a full summary of art history by focusing on major periods in AH, basically from the renaissance on, we focused a lot on issues surrounding patriarchy and the constructed social society where males rule and control. Especially in controlling what is created. These ideas are somewhat new to me and definitely weren't delineated in High School art history. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth understanding this thread that runs through so much of AH. It's kind of like discovering the dirty secret behind something.

1277083767.0,ch5t4,A lot of questions about art history careers (please help!!),,9,3,9,"I was wondering about a few things related to art history and its careers. First

-I am seventeen years old and I have just graduated from high school and am attending a community college to get my AA
-Related to art history studies, humanities I&amp;II (It was really just on western art), and A.P. art history
-I am really only interested in western world art history
-I have over six years in fine arts training through both magnet school classes and outside workshops
-I am very depressed about the idea that the only thing I am interested in/ like is the least lucrative career in the art industry.
-I hate the idea of being a teacher or professor at all.
- I think I would like to study world history in general, I *am* good at art history

Some of the questions that I can think of right now:
1. What degree in art history has the biggest return on investment?
2. What careers pay the most?/ are in the highest demand THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING A TEACHER
3. Are there any law related jobs having to do with art history?
4. Should I minor in something different just in case art doesn't work out and
5.What schools' programs (both undergrad and grad) have the most respected art history programs?
6. Geographically

 I've posted similar questions before but I don't think I was clear enough the first time

**Before I begin I would like to point out that this is a serious post. I do not wish to offend or spark a debate. I'm simply looking for academic answers.**

I am currently writing an essay about the rise and fall of avant-garde modernism in Paris during the 20th Century and of course one of the key elements has to be the German invasion of France in 1940. I want to tie in a particular quote about so-called ""degenerate art"" which goes a little something like this:

*""As for the degenerate artists, and should go to an asylum. If they only pretend to see them blue, they are criminals, and should go to prison. I will purge the nation of them.""* ~ Adolf Hitler

The problem is I can't seem to find the source anywhere. One website suggests that an abbreviated version of this quote was attributed to Hitler by Dorothy Thompson, 1944, which is about as far as the trail leads to...yet this also appears to be something he would typically say in a speech to rile up his audience...

This isn't a field I'm particularly well-versed in, albeit depressing and grim, part of art history and wondered if any of you could help me out?

How he made the piece was just as important in the video I saw as was the finished product of his efforts. He started from nothing (big bang theory)

* The concept was abstract and the ultimate image seemed pretty minimalist considering that his art was representing the cosmos.

I was fortunate to come into possession of this painting and it's simply spectacular in person. It seems to be fairly old as the linen is aged and the oil paint is extremely dirty with dust. The colors are much duller than the pictures suggest (the photo is over saturated for some reason.) At 24"" x 30"" it's very big and the paint is applied very thickly. I can't figure out what the signature says though!! Any guesses or help would be greatly appreciated. This seems like a real treasure and I'd love to verify if this actual is one!

Artist lived in a house in the middle of a body of water while constructing the piece.  

The actual piece was a canoe/boat that he had chiseled out of what i think was a very heavy black stone.

I believe he had a bunch of cats living with him in the house.  

The piece may have been inspired by a pagan myth of some sort.

**TL/DR**: Over about 10 years, artworks, museums, etc together. It's called **The Athenaeum**, and you can check it out [here](http://www.the-athenaeum.org). We just hit 100,000 artworks, I've made some updates since the first post, I'll do this about every three months or so as I develop the site.


**MODS**: I don't want to do anything out-of-line with repeat posts, I hope it's ok. Plus, the discussion last time was really fruitful, and I think it's a natural resource for r/art to be aware of.


**PSA**: Reddit will overload the site for a while



**Changes since original post**

* Updated look: People said the site looked dated
* Better search: I was in the middle of a search update last time
* Better logging in/registration: Upgraded the forum and removed captchas
* Showing copyright status: This has been a ton of work, per US law), and artist and artwork pages have a Copyright tab to explain the reasoning in plain English. Copyright symbols shown in lists of artworks so you don't have to go all the way to the image to find out it's just a thumbnail.
* Random artworks: We now have a random artworks page linked from the home page that loads 12 random artworks at a time.
* Sorting of people is now LASTNAME


**Ideas from original post still being worked on**

* Art movements/schools/styles: I've begun this
* Contact page: Need a contact page instead of the footer going straight to e-mail. This is easy
* ""Mini galleries"" in various places - Maybe on artist listing pages
* Fixing the ""hack"" to get full-res of copyrighted works: Not going to link to it
* Responsive design

**How to help**: Not sure what's ok to say in the post

I'm in grad school for an MFA in Animation

Firstly

I'll make this short and sweet

Essentially the assignment calls for a 10+ page research paper with presentation on an artist and a specific piece of art and an issue.

I'll cut right to the chase though

My proposal was to look into the secret artworks of Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and analyze a small selection of them and try to determine what movement he belonged to.  The issue which I proposed is that some experts kind of argue over where he stands in art history due to his widely varying style of his ""secret art"" collection (NOT illustration/books!)

I won't elaborate on the conversation I had with her in emails but the summary of it is this quoted text:

*Historiographical research does not mean a survey.  It means you choose one piece and you trace its conception from the reasons

So.  Can you guys help me come up with a specific piece of Seuss that was controversial enough to analyze his inspirations

She's reiterated several times that I need to read ""scholarly articles""

1365898192.0,1caqzx,Benjamin West's Native Americans (any West enthusiasts?),snuggle-butt,1,0,9," Hi all!  So I have an academic predicament here.  I have an incomplete for an Art History course taken last semester and I had all of this semester (which is almost over now) to finish a ten page paper on a topic from Neoclassical or Romantic art history (19th century).  It's not like I haven't been trying

I chose Benjamin West with a focus on his depictions of Native Americans because his inclusion of American Indians in his paintings is often very enigmatic and creates a beautiful effect (see ""The Death of General Wolfe, and he did so with greater attention to detail regarding dress and other Native customs than any other hacks that dared to approach the subject.  And compared to his other paintings (his catalog is enormous) these few are very different.  A lot of art historians say West invented modern history painting since he was the first to depict a historic event with his subjects in their contemporary dress instead of using Classical, Biblical, or mythological references to make the subject look impressive.

Guy Johnson: http://www.staroilpainting.com/images/shop/product/b0747a2c1c59f07321ffb3376c2b8dee.jpg

So I chose an oddball topic, discuss Benjamin West's paintings of Native Americans with a fresh approach?  I'm at my fucking wit's end here.  I'm so desperate I'm considering comparisons to various saintly or religious figures (lame).  The Indian in ""A Portrait of Guy Johnson"" looks like a St. Francis of Assisi to me, but does that line up?
