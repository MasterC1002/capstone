Nyt kun on puhuttu Snowdenin julkaisemasta vakoilujupakasta, sillä ruotsin läpi kulkee 100-200 mm valokaapelit. Lähes kaikki Suomen ulkomaan tietoliikenteestä kulkee Ruotsin kautta.

Basically, I guess: do you feel like your country looks better from the outside than it feels from the inside?

The article brings up that some Finns has threatened the broadcaster and called her ""traitor"" and ""swedish whore"". It also tells us that  there are strong public opinions in favor of regarding Sweden as a former occupying power.

Another example in the article is that if Sweden loses early in the Hockey World Cup

This came as quite a shock for me since most people in Sweden consider Finland as the ""brother in the east"" since we share so much history. Another example is our minister of defence that has said that sweden will instantly help finland if you are attacked

So my question is if this article fits in to the real situation in Finland

I moved to Vaasa in August last year on the account of love


One of the first things I applied for was the FPA card, at the same address as my girlfriend. I've also been registered as unemployed at MOL since the day that I got here, and the EURES person at their office assured me I had everything in order to apply for unemployment and/or labour market subsidy if I started interning somewhere. I then promptly started working at a children's daycare centre as an intern. From what I've gathered, Kela is supposed to pay me labour market subsidy for this. After all, I work full days five days a week and there's a 40 kilometer drive each way to get to my workplace.


I received a rejection letter from Kela/FPA about 3 months after I applied


Last week I got yet another rejection letter

I'm living off the last money I got when I sold my car before moving here, she just shook her head in disbelief and tried getting in touch with Kela on my behalf to discuss my case, but it didn't lead to anything. I'm constantly applying for jobs and going on interviews, but it's *really fucking hard* to get an entry-level job when you don't speak the language the majority of the country speaks. I do great in Swedish, but there aren't really that many Swedish-Finnish employers hiring. Does anyone know any magic tricks to be welcomed into this country? I'm running out of options, and fast.

Edit: By racism I mean

Edit: Thanks a lot for the response. Summarily, there is very little direct (open/aggressive) racism, but a considerable amount of indirect (passive) racism, which is mostly from the older people. Also the probability of experiencing it is more in less cosmopolitan areas. But I think all that holds good for most countries today.

Also, is bound to be at least slightly wary of people who look different.

    I have a friend that is at this moment working in a finnish company. She is from Spain.
    Recently a collegue of her
    They are very upset because none of their finnish colleagues went to him to give him their condolences. In Spain this is the usual way to proceed.
    I told her that probably in Finland the silence about this kind of situations is a sign of respect. From my point of view they are preserving his privacy and his decision of talking or not about his father's death. This is my point but I have not had the oportunity to ask any finnish  about this topic.

My sister is going to move to Finland to study for her Nursing degree. She got admitted to the program at Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences. This is the first time she will be living oversea so she is half anxious and half excited about it. Therefore

- The most important thing we are concerned about is what she should bring with her to Finland, scarf, glove and sock?

- Any tip for housing? She is going to live at a place arranged by her university. But I'm sure there is cheaper options out there. 

- Finance issues: Should my sister bring cash? We are from Southeast Asia. From my experience living in the US

- Is there any exchange site for her to purchase second hand stuff like household appliance

- Cell phone plan: Is there any carrier that offers prepaid plan? What's some reasonably priced option? 

That's some of our many concerns right now. Please feel free to add some unrelated tips if you think it's important for us. Thank you very much for your time and I hope you all have a nice day! :)

Even walking through shopping centers or down a road you can see the tension in people's reactions. Most Finns (especially mid-aged) get really tense if you are near them or approaching them. I remember being in a kirpputori and causally browsing the isles and not walking fast or anything.

Hei fellow Redditors of Finland! I will be spending 4 weeks (July) in Pohjois-Pohjanmaa/Northern Ostrobothnia, near to Lake Koivujärvi together with some friends in a nice little cottage with lake access (+ boat and kanootti) and separate sauna house, no TV, no flowing water, electricity from solar collector. We will fly into Helsinki, from there we take an inland flight to Oulu, and then drive for about 170km with a rented car to ‘our’ place. 


Our days will be mainly spent with fishing


I have a few specific as well as general questions which I would like to address to you guys


1\. **Can I bring my Compound Bow to Finland without any troubles at the customs?** After all it’s a piece of sports equipment. I am no hunter but rather a marksman which enjoys precision and I find it to be a great idea to practise in the wild since I have more than enough time in these 4 weeks. Are my reason believable or will I get into trouble. 


2\. **Are bears, or am I mistaken?


3\. **Are the solar collectors any good at this kind of cottages?** Just in general


4\. **Is alcohol sold in specific shops or in super markets?** Also


5\. **For which town should we head if we have the urge to leave our cottage for 2 – 3 days to get among people and have a/few boozy night-out(s)?** Back to Oulu? 


6\. **Unsure if we should import our own Cannabis or rely on local sources.** We are in our late 20’s


7\. **Anything you might want to tell me in addition?** A good place to eat / a must thing to do or to visit? We are here for 4 weeks


That’s it for now. Reading through all the above I must say I find question no. 6 somehow the most important one
Kiitos paljon for your time guys! … and dammit


Cheers

I am an American 19 year old who has dreamed of going to Finland for what seems like my entire life. I will try and remain brief (the story I tell people when they ask ""Why Finland?"") 
&gt;At a young age of around 11-12 through a lesson and project assigned in a class I became very interested in Finland. I read many books about Finland, read The Kalevala, listened to Finnish music (popular, folk, metal, and rap), and eventually met local Finns. I coincidentally dated a Finnish girl for about a year, and made a lot of musical acquaintances from an old Facebook group with around 2

Fast-forward to now and I will be (within the next week) travelling to Finland from the USA to stay in Heinola with my foreign-exchange student friend and his family about a month. I'm pretty damn excited and also trying to not remember everything I've read about Finland because simply put

I have some questions that are not the typical ""What is Finland and what do I bring?"" sort. Kind of just specific things I am packing

Thanks in advance for any replies, etc! :D

**Questions:**

* I own an iPhone 4. Will this automatically work in Finland or will I need to purchase a specific temporary SIM card? Is it even necessary to have my own working phone since I will basically be with my friend who has phone access? I will be contacting my ex-girlfriend and her family at some points during my stay and visiting them...which may be a reason for needing my own Finnish-number. *The phone should still work with Wifi and taking pictures

* My friend and his family own a few Apple products including laptops, I don't expect to have problems finding a charger for my phone but just in case, what sort of outlets are used in Finland? I suspect my charger may not be something that will work.

* I will be going to my bank here in America before I leave and let them know I will be travelling internationally so my card does not get frozen. I use a Visa debit card. Would it be easier to use cash to pay for things? I am unsure if American cards have issues swiping in Finland, etc).

* How much does a round-trip ferry ticket to Estonia cost?

* What is the most efficient way to visit Stockholm or Oslo? Cruise?

* What is the most efficient way to visit St. Petersburg?

* I do not expect to be driving at all

* What type of ID is required for bars, for tourists?

* My friend says he already has all sorts of plans for us (Lapland trip, etc), anything you definitely recommend? I will be seeing all the obvious tourist attractions that are mentioned in every book I read, but anything so different and strange that many tourists may not ever see or steer clear of?

* I'm basically packing for 15-30 degree weather. I know its slightly chillier there recently

*  Anything I should bring as a nice gift from America for my friend and his family? I know my friend loves Vanilla Coke so I might ship that out to him before I leave

* I might be trying to meet up with a few of the musicians that I have become acquainted with over the internet for so many years in Helsinki. Any nice pubs, that are great for such meetings? 

I honestly can't think of any other questions right now because I am super tired

Next week in between doing ""work"" we are going to Tallinn to eat at [this restaurant](http://www.oldehansa.ee/) and see a city that is MUCH older than Helsinki...and on Thursday if it's not raining we are going to [Hvitträsk](http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/hvittrask). **Edited to add:** on my own I will be walking / tram-ing through the Art Deco part of town and also visiting the Arabia district. I will probably stay in the city for Juhannus itself and of course in 2 days I am going to a local [reddit meetup](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/reddit-couchsurfing-pree-juhannus/)!

This is my first visit to Finland for more than a day (came on a Baltic cruise ship in the 80s) and probably the last I can afford (in time/money) for years to come

In addition to my host's recommendations (he is not to blame for the following) I already know I want to see some Finnish tango (sadly just missed [a good performance](www.kompitus.com)), a leather festival that looks as if it's for men primarily, but I did bring one pair of my best leather boots just in case. (I enjoy dress up of all kinds and so now you know why I particularly appreciated the ladies in historical costumes, but I tried to act properly and with respect while I was in there.)

Also your food sounds so god-damn-FU**ing amazing (Mammi in particular sounds totally awesome)

So I hope you don't mind if I ask some questions! If some of these come off as rude or A little to personal

* What Is the culture like? More in regard to family culture

* Is it paralytically difficult to make friends in Finland? Are the Finnish A social

* What is the working culture like? Are you guys “hard men” that work 20 hours A day and rest for 4?

* What are the hunting laws like? And is hunting A large part of your culture? (It's massive over here)

* Can you get around without speaking fluent Finnish?

* Are there A large amount of outdoor clubs? Eg: Tramping

* What is the weather like in summer? (Winter is pretty self explanatory)

* Do the Finns have A problem with eccentric/energetic/outgoing people?

The next question might be come off as A little strange/personal. Please just tell me! And don't think I am some dirty bastard just going overseas for A shag!

* Are the women in Finland friendly?

Finns respect Lenin as he recognised Finland's independence 3 weeks after the declaration (in stark contrast to what happened to the other nations who declared their independence from Russia at this time) as he himself respected the Finns for when he was in hiding there. And although the Soviets supported the Reds in the Civil war the view is that without Lenin as leader of the Russian SFSR the first few tentative years of Finnish independence would have been harder like other nations who had recently declared independence; for example look at Estonia.

I'm a Canadian student that has been living abroad for almost a year in France. I have 2 months off before I have to restart University back in Canada and was intending on spending 2 weeks in Finland from the 4th of July until the 17th.

I will be coming from Krakow (Poland) by plane to Helsinki and will leave from Helsinki by plane as well.

I am going to be with a good friend of mine and the two of us really enjoy hiking. I realize the  Archipelago National Park seems really beautiful but is it really a good idea to visit by foot? (It seems you need a boat to really visit it well + we want to find a 6 or 7 day trail so we can do some camping and fishing). I read a little about the Lakeland which seems really nice and more fitting to travel by foot and also it seems to have longer trails (up to 150 km) but getting there seems to be the problem.

Like I said we intend of spending at least 6-8 days hiking and we're gonna keep a 3 or 4 day hole in our schedule to visit Helsinki and the surrounding area. Which brings me to my next point: The festivals. 

To get a good feeling of the Finnish culture we would like to find out if there are any festivals going on during the time period which we will be staying in. (4th until the 17th).

Really any tips would be helpful; either it be traditional food, historical monument, national parks, bar (Especially cool Helsinki bars) or anything really!

Cheers and thank you in advance! 

EDIT1: Wow ! Just got back home from work and thanks a lot for all the info! I have a much better idea of what my options are here.

Your responses confirm some of my concerns:

I'm going to be attending a summer course in Vaasa for the month of July. I'm a university student in New York City with two years of Finnish experience. 

-I was looking for some advice on getting to Vaasa

-What's the vibe like in Vaasa? I looked it up and it seems like there's a Swedish population as well as some Finns. I've been to Helsinki, and Tampere so the closest thing I can imagine to something more of that demographic is Hanko. 

-If anyone is from Vaasa or has been there

-Any tips on how to get people to respond in Finnish more? I probably can get by. Puhun vahan suomea (probably an understatement) and I noticed people love switching to English as soon as I have a little grammar mistake or struggle with a few words.

Thanks!

* Do Universities/Polytechnics care more about entrance exam scores or transcript grades when considering prospective students for enrollment?
* Is it possible to take an entrance exam abroad?
* Are entrance exams uniform throughout the country
* What are some good websites to use as information resources to find out more about applying to/studying in Finnish Universities/Polytechnics?

* I am not necessarily looking to transfer any college credits.

The entire route was 162 km (100 miles) with shortest day being around 7 km (4.5 miles) and longest 36 km (22.3 miles).

I maybe able to post the exact route later on but the approximate route was Rantasalmi - Oravi - trip around Koloveden Kansallispuisto (national park) - Oravi - Linnansaari (part of the Linnansaaren Kansallispuisto) - Rantasalmi.


[Saimaa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saimaa) is the largest lake in Finland and also the (only) home to [Saimaa Ringed Seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saimaa_Ringed_Seal)

Koloveden kansallispuisto is mostly off limits for anything using motors. It's very peaceful and quiet there


If you ever go to this area,28.498535&amp;hnear=Oravi&amp;t=m&amp;z=15) is pretty good base of operation for longer exploration as it's in the middle of two nice areas. Also Linnansaari is a place you would want to visit.

* I am scared that I'm going to be snowed in

I've never seen real snow before. Living in the subtropics of Queensland, but I don't know if its hard, if you can walk through it, if it melts at all... it's something so foreign to me that I can not understand how Nordic places survive under all that snow!

I'm also scared I'm going to be snowed in if I visit during the colder months. Does this happen a lot? If it does

* Not knowing the language

While several tourism sites have said that people should know english

* I'm allergic to all manner of things

Peanuts, penicillin... the first two are deadly, the other two can put me in hospital for days. I will obviously have travel insurance, but I want to know if allergies and the like are known in Finland. I know that I can't ever really visit asian countries because of my allergies, so I have to be careful about where I choose to go. Also, are the emergency services good?

I'm a 28 year old guy from Spain that will be attending a conference in Tampere next October

I would like to ask you all for advice. I have traveled a lot around Europe

1) Do you know of any affordable place where I can stay? I don't care about sharing a room, any other options?

2) About the language

3) I assume it will be cold

4) Any chance of having a good view of the aurora borealis or should I travel to the north for that?

5) I have read of some places to go visit, places nearby to go hiking? I'm not very interested in museums.

6) I love music. Do you happen to know if there is any music festival or concert in October? Any bars with live music? I know your country is famous for some heavy metal festivals, heavy metal, techno and many other kinds of electro music, so I guess this wide variety of styles will give me some options, right?

7) I also love drinking some beer and meeting people

8) As for food, so I'll definitely try it. Any other food worth trying?

9) I would also like to know about you Tampere inhabitants. Do you enjoy chatting with obviously foreigner strangers? Or you usually just talk with your group of friends? Would it be weird if a tan, a lot of students live in Tampere, so I was guessing people were probably used to  interact with strangers.

10) Where is it OK to smoke? I guess it is like almost everywhere else in Europe and outdoors smoking is almost always fine.


I think this covers pretty much any doubt I have. Thank you for reading! And of course thank you for helping me. I can't wait to visit your country!

**EDIT** I'm back from my trip, which was very interesting to me. And no one prepared me for the amount of alcohol Finns drink, I could not keep up with their pace!

Summarizing, you have been very helpful! If you ever come to Spain, PM me and ask for help if you need it, I'll be glad to give you directions or advice. Thank you!",,False,self,1350293939.0,t3_ztip1

I've already decided to go to Levykauppa Äx since they have a better metal selection than any store in Iceland. I've seen some places before
I'm a bit difficult because my activities need to be located around the centrum because I need to be at the train station by 17. I'm mostly looking for suggestions on places to check out (stores are included if you know of anything that a foreigner should check out or if it has a good selection of black-and/or doom metal) and a nice café/bar to hang out at. Also looking for suggestions for cheap-ish but good restaurant (fast food is fine) since I'm on somewhat of a budget (my friends say I have enough money but I'm still worried).

I'm hoping one of you can help with some advice.

I'm going to be in Helsinki all of August for work; I work for a company based in Vantaa. 

My wife and 16 month old son are going to join me for the last 2 weeks.  We are renting an apartment and the apartment owner doesn't have children's equipment to loan or rent.

There are two pieces of equipment that I'm hoping to find for these two weeks:

Play Pen Also Suitable For Sleeping

This is what we use when we travel in the US; it serves as both a playpen during the day and a crib for sleeping:

We're a group of four middle-aged Swedes who took up bicycle touring a couple of years ago

We like staying and sleeping outdoors

Also

Right now

We've also heard the route Nådendal -&gt; Tammerfors -&gt; Vaasa -&gt; Björneborg -&gt; Nådendal are really nice?

The main plan is to experience as much of Finnish nature and culture as possible. We will be there for up to three weeks and can comfortably cover 75 km per day in average. We'll probably start at either Helsinki or Turku

So, you must see... you should avoid... ?
