This is the 2nd news org that posted it and the CNN news guy only took one camera thus confirming nothing.

If you would be willing to do this

Thanks!


**Edit:**   Phyridean

**Edit 2:** Agnostix is organizing.  PM if local and available.  Also seems at least one person will be there Saturday at noon.

**Edit 3:** A relatively large group will be at 84th and federal 11:30am/noon this Saturday.   Let us know guys and thanks again for the effort!

**Edit 4:**  I've asked a few of the participants to PM me their links after they're done.  I will update this post with the link to whatever they find be it reddit posts or just youtube vids.  Either is fine for me.

**FINAL UPDATE**  All further information will be gathered here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/13da3k/this_is_the_denver_ufo_meeting_followup_post/

We did good things today. 

About 8-12 redditors from the Denver area showed up today around 11:30 AM and started recording 30-60 FPS

We stopped recording around 1:30 PM and promptly went for pizza across the street (thanks

There were at least 4 quality cameras running for the entire time

This post is being created as a way for those who showed up to come together to share your captures.

I personally want to thank everyone who showed up. It was a great time. Let's now analyze and report our findings. 

I'm currently sorting through my hour+ worth of HD footage. I'll post a link to raw video ASAP

*Fox 31 actually showed up today and interviewed us.* They apparently caught wind (pun intended) of our meeting and sent a camera guy to cover the event. It will air tonight on the Saturday evening news broadcast. 

I will be going out again over the course of the next week or two to video some more. Anyone interested in joining me

In case you're wondering

Stay tuned to this post for that clip and others from those who joined me. 

Thanks again!! 

EDIT: I found our first [""UFO""](http://i.imgur.com/AZ4j6.jpg). Sarcastic quotes used on ""UFO"" because it's a fly. They were everywhere. 

EDIT 2: And BAM - I just found the [money shot](http://i.imgur.com/LD6Df.jpg). I believe this is all that's needed to bolster the bug hypothesis. 

EDIT 3: ~~I just got Halo 4 and am off to play it until my eyes bleed~~ I'm heading out for the night...but my computer is currently uploading about 30 minutes of unedited video to youtube. It won't be live for another few hours (it's 4:30 PM now). I'll post a link when it's done - feel free to scrub it for UFOs yourselves!!

EDIT 4: **Holy bickering redditors

EDIT 4 redux: I'm headed out to the site today around 11:30 and will be using my brand spankin' new 255mm zoom lens to get some really good mid-field video. Feel free to join me! As for the youtube link...mother %*#(-ing power went out at my condo yesterday evening so I'm having to restart my original uploads. Thanks for your patience. I'll get the link out soon. 

EDIT 5: Nothing remarkable came from my shooting yesterday (Sunday, please let me know and I'll timestamp it and correlate with others who were shooting at the same time.

I saw the Walkmen mon night at the Ogden (which was great) and met a couple people at the pub after. I walked home by myself, when I fell they held the gun to my head and stomped my face into the curb as they took everything from my pockets.  I am not large (5'9 155), but I am very fit, but no one has a chance against three guys with a gun who rush from behind.  This was on the front step of my house.  I have spent the last few days dealing with police and doctors and banks and trying to score a phone, and now my jaw is wired shut, and will be for the next five weeks because it has major fractures in two spots, not to mention the dental work needed when they unwire me.  But I'm still alive and I'm gonna take some time off work to go visit my little nieces and nephews, right?

The moral of the story is:

DONT WALK HOME BY YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

NEVER WALK HOME DRUNK BY YOURSELF THROUGH ANYTHING LESS SAFE THAN SUBURBIA.  KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU

TL;DR No more street food in LoDo if conditions of Vendors permits are not changed.

The snow hit just as my daughters gym class ended. Unperturbed I parked up at King Soopers in Centennial to do my groceries and when I came back out laden with shopping and two hungry and chilly kids

So, and two cold and scared kids.

I tried a few friends on my mobile

I got out of the car (in a t-shirt and jeans) and looked under the hood to see if there was anything I could do.

The guy parked in the space in front of me got out of his car to check what was up. He too had a flat battery and was waiting on a friend to come and give him a jumpstart. 

When his friend arrived, but I didn't have anyway to get the car later, even if I called a tow.

I spotted an old Brakes Plus sticker on the car and called them from the superstore (they let me use their phone!) as I knew they were just across the block from where I was. The guy on the phone was very sweet and when I explained I had the kids with me and no coats etc

Clear all dead and dry brush and grass away from your house; the further away you clear the safer you are. Nothing flammable should be right next to your house including wood mulch. If I still lived in the Springs I’d be taking out the hedges and rose bushes near the house. Stacks of wood, etc. need to go away. Be 100% thorough. Mow everything within 10-15 feet of your home. Rake the dead stuff right next to your home. It will get very hot for quite awhile and those green leaves will turn as dry as paper and then eventually burn.

Trees are now your enemy and may cost you your home. Cut down spruce trees that overhang or are right next to your home. Cut off all low dead branches.

Be smart about where you put debris; expect it to be very windy when your neighborhood burns over.

Clean your decks and carports; just pile things in the garage for now. Put the extra car or boat in the garage or away from the house.

If you live on a hill realize that fire spreads more quickly uphill.

Last December, the district is not using its taxpayer dollars on its students.  The link to this report can be found [here.](http://www.adams12.org/files/boe/Fact_Finding_Report.pdf)

Instead of investing in these kids

* cut middle school sports
* cut course offerings; for example
* cut Outdoor Ed
* increase the walk distances so that more students are walking further to/from school when they could be bussed
* increase student fees; students must also pay to ride the bus
* class sizes are becoming too large; I teach a mix of 32 freshmen
* reduce the number of campus supervisors; the building I work in serves 1800 students and we have only three campus supervisors 

Please help by spreading the word about this situation.  Fox 31 News is airing an investigative report about the Adams 12 School District this Monday through Wednesday (Feb 4-6) at 9 p.m. each night.  I have an image from [Fox 31's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fox31denver) that you are more than welcome to share on your own Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/what have yous.  The image can be found [here.](http://i.imgur.com/gBP6Imx.jpg)

Please help me spread the word by sharing this if you can.  My students do not deserve this and the Denver community needs to know what is going on in its public schools.  Thank you so much in advance.  

And no I don't secretly work for Fox News haha :)

Yes.  With the passing of [Amendment 64](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/s/regulate-marijuana-alcohol-act-2012) marijuana possession of an ounce or less has been made legal in the state of Colorado for people 21 years of age or older.

**I don't live in Colorado

Yes.  It is legal for anyone within state boundaries to possess and consume cannabis provided they're over 21 years of age.  Once retail stores open in 2014 visitors to the state will be limited to purchasing a quarter ounce at a time

**I'm not 21 yet

Yes

**So now that it's legal I can just go out and buy it

Wrong.  Retail stores won't open up until 2014 and the law is written so that the only legal way to sell marijuana will be through these retail stores.

**Then how am I supposed to get my marijuana?**

You can grow your own marijuana

You can also try to find someone who's willing to give you marijuana for free. The text of the amendment clearly allows for marijuana to be given away freely.

**So I can't buy any weed?**

Legally

**Now that I've got some cannabis

You are allowed to possess marijuana most anywhere in the state of Colorado.  Private businesses and residences may choose to disallow people from possessing it on their property, federal courthouses, national parks and national forests.  The city of Greenwood Village has also enacted legislation [barring possession/transportation of marijuana in all public spaces, including roads and sidewalks](http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22500645/greenwood-village-ordinance-test-pot-legalization-law).

**What if I live in a college dorm room?**

Sorry

**Who cares about simple possession

Consumption of marijuana is legal in Colorado in ""private"".  The only place this clearly includes is inside private residences (with the homeowner's permission).  Boulder is so far unique in legally defining ""private property"" as [any part of a residential property](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_23039897/boulder-approves-pot-use-adults-private-property)

Businesses may allow on-site consumption if they're not a marijuana retail (it's illegal to consume marijuana at any place that sells marijuana

You can't smoke while walking down the street or playing in a park or driving your car.  You will probably see people smoking out in the open but they're not doing so legally.

**Is my personal car a private space that I can smoke in?**

No.  Unless your car is parked in your own garage while you're in it

**I've just consumed cannabis

Probably not.  The [legal limit](http://www.statebillinfo.com/bills/bills/12/1325_01.pdf) for THC in Colorado to operate a vehicle is 5ng/ml of blood.  Many habitual smokers are at this limit without even smoking in the past 12 hours.  If you are pulled over and they suspect you are under the influence

**Can I take cannabis with me outside of the state?**

No, you may also take marijuana with you.  States that allow medical marijuana reciprocity are Maine, Michigan, Montana, Rhode Island and Arizona.

**Now that marijuana's legal

Yes.  The amendment explicitly states that no part of the amendment is intended to affect the ability for employers to have policies restricting the use of marijuana by their employees.

**How much do things cost?**

Currently

**So why would folks even bother with a medical marijuana red card?**

As mentioned above

**Resistance**

Your city is laid out like a grid, a high amount of gun ownership in Colorado (Especially in the surrounding countryside and inner city). The interstates would pump freshly infected for only a brief while before they are shut down. Backroads are easily patrolled by military units, with clear lines of sight from block-to-block, making it comparatively easy to fortify the central city.

Food and fuel is your number one concern. Your city is ranked 6th in wind power, because you *will* run out of fuel for coal-fired plants rather quickly.

Assuming you shut down offices' power, (unlike many other places in the country) and if your local Government does a good job, you likely have enough power to run essentials such as water treatment for a time while also keeping a crackdown on the few inlets into the city.

You aren't immune from forest fires, you could create a dead-zone for the summertime fires to keep it away from the city.

Denver Airport will have to be cut-off. It is too far out, but with enough forward thinking, hydroponics or getting clever with rooftop/office/public space gardening, you may well weather it out until a Summertime wildfire wipes out the zombies for thousands of miles around you, at the cost of any lone-wolf survivors who have managed to survive until the wildfire hits.

**Downfall**

If food doesn't last, then I suggest moving from place to place and just trying to pick off and thin out the herd with reusable weapons, such as a concrete brick suspended via rope/pole across the street, with a rope to pull it back and let it go like a pendulum to pick off zombies in the streets below. Perhaps when a fire hits, you can hope diffusion gets the zombies to spread out thinly enough to re-establish a battle line.

**Outer ring:**

Denver is in near-constant danger of wildfires in the Summertime. 

Assuming the apocalypse hits in the Winter and you don't have to deal with ill-equipped refugees trying to camp out in the woods (creating a fire), assuming the central city has held out, a raging inferno will bear down on the city, *completely* unchecked. You may have only a brief warning before it's move-or-die. Any crops survivors are trying to make will wither, some will suffocate, and more will burn.

I do not have any metric for what would happen to the center city, or to enact whatever backup plan you have to get out of there.

Theater 8

I woke up on the morning of July 19th with an excited smile. I was going to see the new Batman movie, reading Batman comics, watching the trailers – even playing Batman video games. Our excitement could no longer be contained, so we took our pre-printed tickets and left for Century 16 six hours before the show would begin. As we drove we talked of the scenes from the trailers and tried to plot bust the final film before we would see it. We walked through the doors smiling wide, looking at all of the people bearing the black and yellow symbol of The Dark Knight across their chests. We fiddled with a machine scanning our tickets unsuccessfully for several minutes before finally getting help from a cashier. As soon as our tickets came we walked in disbelief over to where they’d roped off an area for people to sit and wait, excited as children on Christmas morning. We were finally going to see our hero rise for the final time. I frantically kept checking my ticket stub, fearing it would disappear if I didn’t check that it was in my pocket every few seconds. I couldn’t stop smiling as I looked at it. Dark Knight Rises showed in bold letters across the top with House 8 directly below. We purchased our tickets at 7:14, and couldn’t be happier. Shortly after we arrived we met a very nice and VERY excited guy (we later learned his name is Alex), he called

As usual the trailers began, and enjoying the show. Our excitement grew steadily as new characters were introduced, and the story began to unfold. We were taken to the story of a cop, and into the middle of a harsh action packed gun battle. Suddenly it was as though the movie was no longer a movie, the chaos on the screen had manifested itself into the very room. At first the sounds of what I thought to be cheap fire crackers didn’t phase me. Smoke billowed around the right side of the theater where people had previously been entering. This still didn’t phase me. I was determined to ignore the asshole interrupting my film, I wasn’t going to let fire crackers ruin my night. Noemi gripped my arm, worried, and more “smoke” billowed around the right side of the room. It didn’t occur to me until later that it was not smoke, there’s a man out there shooting people.” The only light in the room came from the big screen, as though a switch of understanding struck me along with everyone else we began rushing back up the stairs towards the exits above at the top level – not the ones we came through. Noemi and I rushed out onto the bright and loud balcony level overlooking the main lobby. We were in the middle of what seemed like a war. Police officers with shot guns and pistols rushed below and out of sight while others guarded the stairs up to our level

I shook my head, and that we were okay. Rumors of a death passed from person to person. My world was shattered. I had to get her out of there. Without hesitation she led me back to the car, and I drove us out of the parking lot behind a line of cars trying to escape the massacre. Sirens cut through the air as countless police cars and ambulances rushed past us. The fear deepened as I saw this. I wanted answers. How many people were injured? How many had been killed? Did I know any of them? I still don’t know if I do know any of them. I am shaking as I type my story now, recalling what happened. 9 news plays the details as I type now. Twelve dead, around fifty wounded. It is nearly ten o’clock in the morning. Ten bodies still remain inside of the theater. If we hadn’t purchased our tickets in advance, or arrived for good seats five hours before the movie… would we have been in the seats where people were being hit with bullets and debris from the walls? I don’t know. What if we’d been in theater 9 instead of 8? Would I be alive to tell you my story? I don’t know. I never saw the man who shot up theater 9. I heard he was dressed in black, and wore a gas mask as he used a rifle and two pistols on helpless innocent people. Men, children. Children. Cute kids dressed up as the caped crusader or the infamous back breaking Bane. There is no justice that can be brought to James Holmes. He deserves a fate worse than the most agonizing death can offer. I want to see him burn alive,,False

Yes, [as it was originally intended](http://www.denverpost.com/music/ci_17533323).  

I think we need to bring it back, but it seems like most contain the festival in one big park.  I went to the Summer Music Festival in Quebec City that did something interesting; rather than have multiple stages in one big park, it spread them out over multiple smaller parks that were within easy walking/transit distance from each other.  We could have stages at Confluence Park, Civic Center, somewhere on 16th, and maybe Wash Park or Cheesman (other possible places: Elitches, Auraria, etc). That would distribute people throughout the city, or shuttles.

1372789361.0,1higbb,Warning: Don't use King Moving and Storage in Aurora,TheSuperSucker,101,11,24,"Using this company was

We set up our move through a national company called Father and Son Moving, King Moving and Storage. We confirmed our move date almost two weeks in advance and paid a $100 deposit for our move on Friday 6/28. The day before the move, King called to confirm for a morning move. I had to remind them that we had been set up for an afternoon move. This was my first contact with King and I should have taken it as an omen. Luckily, they had scheduled a lady for an afternoon move who had actually wanted a morning move, so they just switched us. Crisis averted, or so I thought.

We were told that our move window was 2-4pm. At 1:30, and they were going to have to move us first thing the next day. Really? They offered us 5% off because of this inconvenience. I asked for 10% and the representative told me he couldn't do that. I called Father and Son to discuss the situation and they were able to get us the extra 5%, although I was still mad about the situation. I called King and told them that the next day would be fine. I was told that we would be moved first thing in the morning and the move window was 6-8am. I asked, since we were first, if we could get a more set time and I was told that they have to give a two hour window because they don't know what traffic is going to be like. I didn't think traffic would be an issue at 6am on a Saturday, but I reluctantly agreed.

My girlfriend and I were up and at the apartment at 6am. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. At 8:05 I called King. I was told that the movers HADN'T EVEN ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE and that he didn't know when they would be getting there. I didn't receive a phone call or anything from King to let me know. I had to call them. The dispatcher on the phone seemed flustered and I asked him to call me as soon as the movers arrived and were headed our way.

10am, I called again and nobody answered. 11am, I called again and nobody answered. At this point I wondered if they were screening their calls so they wouldn't have to talk to me. At 12:15 my girlfriend called from her phone and somebody answered (suspicions confirmed about them screening calls). She explained the situation and asked what the plan was. Silence on the other end. She even had to say ""are you still there?"" The dispatcher then said that he would get a manager, at which point they hung up on her.

At 1pm I called Father and Son, which she said I could.

I got a call back from the F&amp;S representative telling me that King had a truck available and they were on their way. I told her not to bother and that I wanted to cancel.

The whole thing was a debacle. Luckily, didn't honor our rescheduled move, and blatantly refused to talk to me about why any of this was happening or to let me know what was going on. 

I will never use this company again.

**MORE TIPS**

**According to AAA**

* During non-emergency situations, you should not be braking hard enough to activate the anti-lock braking system.

* During emergency situations, pumping the brakes will not help you in any way, and can even be counterproductive. Just step on the pedal and let the electronics “pump” for you

* Of course

**Some tips from The Weather Channel**

* Driving in Snow and Ice

The best advice for driving in bad winter weather is not to drive at all

Don't go out until the snow plows and sanding trucks have had a chance to do their work

If you must drive in snowy conditions

It's helpful to practice winter driving techniques in a snowy

1. Driving safely on icy roads
1. Decrease your speed and leave yourself plenty of room to stop. You should allow at least three times more space than usual between you and the car in front of you. 
1. Brake gently to avoid skidding. If your wheels start to lock up
1. Turn on your lights to increase your visibility to other motorists.
1. Keep your lights and windshield clean.
1. Use low gears to keep traction
1. Don't use cruise control or overdrive on icy roads.
1. Be especially careful on bridges, if the conditions are wet, you might encounter ice in shady areas or on exposed roadways like bridges.
1. on't pass snow plows and sanding trucks. The drivers have limited visibility
1. Don't assume your vehicle can handle all conditions. Even four-wheel and front-wheel drive vehicles can encounter trouble on winter roads. 



**If your rear wheels skid...**

1.  Take your foot off the accelerator. 

2.  Steer in the direction you want the front wheels to go. If your rear wheels are sliding left

3.  If your rear wheels start sliding the other way as you recover

4.  If you have standard brakes

5.  If you have anti-lock brakes (ABS)

**If your front wheels skid...**

1.  Take your foot off the gas and shift to neutral

2.  As the wheels skid sideways, and accelerate gently. 

**If you get stuck...**

1.  Do not spin your wheels. This will only dig you in deeper.

2.  Turn your wheels from side to side a few times to push snow out of the way. 

3.  Use a light touch on the gas

4.  Use a shovel to clear snow away from the wheels and the underside of the car.

5.  Pour sand, to help get traction.

6.  Try rocking the vehicle. (Check your owner's manual first — it can damage the transmission on some vehicles.) Shift from forward to reverse

I take care of my 3 sons, and heroin addicts who need help and as well as love and understanding in the same day. I help anyone anytime even when I am not asked. I humbled myself to ask for help for this little puppy and by my surprise it came!
I received a message from a fellow redditor (username: Silent_R) who offered to pay for her care. I was shocked and skeptical. I rushed to the vet and they called my anonymous benefactor and he did exactly what he promised. I cried and cried when I realized my new friend was real. 
I owe him everything. My heart will never be the same after the kindness he has shown me. I will do my best to repay him every penny

It’s been 3 days and I’ve yet to see any media outlet compile a bio of everyone on Hickenlooper’s Marijuana Task Force.  So I gave it a go.

I’m biased.  But my biases are only through the scope that I believe Colorado can have a marijuana industry as fruitful, and internationally celebrated as our craft beer scene.  (After all, didn’t we vote to regulate marijuana like alcohol?)  If you share my same outlook, I encourage you to try be active in the rulemaking process.

The way the news was reported

Despite Amendment 64 passing with more YEA votes than any US President or politician Coloradans have ever cast their vote for

**TL;DR:**  (I'll just put it up here) On the surface, the “Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act of 2012” passed overwhelmingly.  We voted to regulate marijuana like alcohol.  We have a working alcohol regulatory structure that need only be reapplied to marijuana.  The sole purpose of this Task Force is to deviate from the model you and I voted for.

This first meeting was a brainstorming session.  My overall opinion?  I wasn't that optimistic going in,"" the primary objective of the Task Force as laid out in Hickenlooper's press release.  ""Reinventing the wheel"" may be a [gross understatement](http://meblogwritegood.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/screen-shot-2011-07-21-at-3-33-40-pm.png).

**THE POSITIVES:**

* All A-64 Task Force meetings will be public.  NOTE: They're NOT at the Capital!  They're at the CO Dept of Revenue ""Gaming Board Room"" 17301 W. Colfax Ste. 135, Feb 5, Feb 19, and if necessary, Feb 28.

* All Task Force meetings should allow for at least 30 minutes of public testimony.   (Caveat: if the Task Force operates like the state legislature, the Task Force Co-Chairs may begin requiring people to sign up in advance on the Department of Revenue website.

* To maximize input and minimize testimony, all inquiries can be directed to Mark Couch, the Task Force press liaison, at **mark.couch@state.co.us**

* While the Task Force membership is closed, should they choose to entertain those requests or acknowledge an individual's particular expertise.

**THE MEETING:**

All members of the Task Force were in attendance except John Salazar

The chairpersons distributed binders to all the members which were not for public purview.  The binders included a committee contact list
identifying geographical areas where dispensary bans and other restrictions are currently in place.  The binders also included the [full text of A64](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/s/regulate-marijuana-alcohol-act-2012), the [Cole Memo](http://safeaccessnow.org/downloads/James_Cole_memo_06_29_2011.pdf), as well as a general statement that Washington State, not having previous experience with a medical marijuana program, will be looking to Colorado's example to help implement their state's legalization effort, Initiative 502.

**PROCEDURE:**

The Task Force will ""strive for consensus"" regarding all policy matters.  ""Strive for consensus"" was clarified to mean the attitude: ""will this work

If consensus cannot be reached

Approval of procedural issues requires a majority vote of the people in attendance.

Approval of policy or ""issues of substance"" requires a majority vote of the Task Force.

There will be no additions to the Task Force membership.  Additions *may* be made to any subcommittee

The Task Force will be divided into 5 subcommittees.  These subcommittees are charged with creating an efficient regulatory structure, Legislature, etc).  The subcommittees are:

* Overall Regulatory Framework

**PEANUT GALLERY &amp; PUBLIC TESTIMONY**

&gt; Plea for members to tour dispensaries or grow operations; ""See the businesses you're decisions will impact."" (Six Task Force members began to raise their hands

&gt; Oppose DUID- setting a minimum nanogram limit defines impairment without determining impairment

&gt; Plea to reassure local governments of the progress of the Task Force and not rush into local bans

&gt; Dissolve the MMED altogether. Simplify licensing requirements and classification.

&gt; Regulating THC content of cannabis buds is absurd when edibles and oils can be so highly concentrated. Poses that Task Force members are unknowledgeable.

&gt; State-operated dispensaries would trigger DOJ interference for expressly violating the ""positive conflict"" clause of the Controlled Substances Act

&gt; The Governor or Department of Revenue should put out a press release defining exactly what is currently legal for Coloradans

&gt; The Feds will come after banking.  Colorado needs an in-state exchange and insurance system to move the black market over to a legal market.

&gt; Upset that there are no card-holding marijuana patients on the Task Force

&gt; Loose regulation will minimize the black market.  Suggests Task Force members may not be willing to acknowledge ""the sheer amount of marijuana available"" that is out of their control.

&gt; Affirm employee rights in Colorado; address marijuana and medication in anti-discriminatory laws regarding physical disabilities and handicaps

&gt; Create laws determining what happens at the airport

&gt; Follow the alcohol model that allows for Colorado's generous craft beer market  *(a man after my own heart)*

&gt; Ease plant count and patient count regulations

The requirements for this job would be that you're at least 16 years old

Currently working at the store would be myself, and Mitch. We are all male and range from 18-22 years old. We are all pretty easy going and friendly. Lastly at least 3/4's of us do happen to be 420 friendly, what you do in your free time is none of my concern, however if it gets in the way of business it will be a problem. If you are able to maintain a good performance than it doesn't matter to me. That said, I have no tolerance for showing up drunk OR making customers uncomfortable by your obviousness of being stoned. As long as you can be responsible and smart about your actions though it won't matter.

1. If you live near the fire be prepared to evacuate. Fire moves fast and many of the people I talked to had five minutes between the time they were told to evacuate until when their property was engulfed in flames. 

2. The most important thing to pack and bring with you is your pets. One of the most common ways people die in wildfires is because they went back to save a family pet.   Shelters will allow pets.

3. Be sure to bring prescriptions. It can be very difficult to get replacements. 

4. Don't forget your important papers such as birth certificates

5.  If you have time take pictures of your home and property before leaving. Most phones can do pictures or video and this will be very helpful in proving value if things are lost. 

6.  Don't worry about food. Shelters will provide food for you. 

7.  If possible grab a week's worth of clothes but that should be a low priority. Tons of clothing will be donated to fire victims. 

8. Expect to be out of your home for at least a week. Even if your property isn't damaged

9.  If there are multiple evacuation shelters go to the main one. That is where the insurance companies and federal representatives will focus their attention. 

10.  Don't risk your life. One of the fire victims in Texas was killed because he went back into the fire area to get a tool he had left behind.   Fire is unpredictable,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,t3_rg1rm

So I did that and all was good. 

The next day

So I get off work and walk to the gas station to borrow their gas can. As it turns out

This guy about my age heard me talking with the attendant and turned and said ""wait

I nodded dumbly.

I'm not really a believer in karma but that whole experience was pretty convincing. Just thought I'd share it with one of my favorite subreddits because this is where it all started.

Between the prohibitionists and the protectionists on the committee, ""Voters set sail for the New World but the ship captains laid plans for a flat Earth ahead.""

So will we be able to legally smoke marijuana in a bar setting? In the words of Reverend Lovejoy,* Long answer: No, with a *but...*""

I'll start with the latter; the former is my TL;DR.

**NO

I'll list these 7 recommendations

1. Create regulations with the overarching philosophy that alcohol and marijuana should NOT be consumed in combination

2. Explicitly prohibit marijuana products that are combined with tobacco or alcohol. (Sorry

3. Amend the body of the Clean Air Act to change instances of ""tobacco"" to ""tobacco and marijuana""

4. Amend the Cigar-Tobacco Bar exemption to explicitly DISALLOW marijuana consumption (Sorry

5. Amend ""the outdoor area of any business"" exemption to explicitly DISALLOW marijuana consumption -- **NO CONSENSUS**. The two leading recommendations are: 1; explicitly disallow it

6. Redefine consumption conducted ""Openly and Publicly""

6a. Openly -- **NO CONSENSUS**. However

6b. Publicly: *area is open to general access* **without restriction**. It was clarified that ID-checking, would all be considered restrictions.

7. Create separate

So... before we can smoke marijuana in a bar legally, and must specifically delegate the authority to allow counties to create certain marijuana-related exemptions to the Clean Air Act.

So smoking in a bar legally may still require some hoop-jumping on a local level. Going to one bar to purchase both alcohol and weed to drink and smoke on-premises may be a whole 'nother animal.

And I say *may* because the General Assembly may not like any of the Task Force recommendations

Anyway

Site links: 

[OccupyDenver.org](http://occupydenver.org)

[Denver Post Article](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19325299)

Don't be surprised if the article disappears or is edited.

**EDIT** - Here's a [related article](http://presstv.com/detail/209849.html) from PressTV contradicting the Post article.

**EDIT 2** - Actually

**EDIT 3** - After looking up related articles, the only difference being that the more recent one has a headline and image that make the protesters look bad, whereas the original article headline and image looked a bit more...police state.

Is it within a 2ish mile radius of Downtown Denver? Check [DenverInfill](http://denverinfill.com/blog). We keep up with the downtown projects. Everything we post

For all other projects around Denver proper and smaller scale projects around downtown

Once you've located your permit record number, head on over [here](http://www.denvergov.org/developmentservices/DenverDevelopmentServices/HelpMeFind/CheckYourBuildingPlanReviewStatus/tabid/437372/Default.aspx), type / paste the record number in the box and click check status. This will show you if there are any reviews such as zoning, design, etc. The first four numbers of the permit is the year it was filed. If it's 2010 / 2011, there's a good chance it's an inactive project.

Some permits don't have any details when you look them up but are active projects. To dig a little deeper type the project name in Google like this: ""1756 Clarkson"" denvergov. This limits your search mostly to www.denvergov.org and you can usually find out more information about the project you are researching such as site plans
