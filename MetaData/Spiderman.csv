http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQL4EkEHFQ8

It doesn't really spoil the movie too much other than Spider-man puts Connors in jail (big surprise)

I think it was Morbius. Before I explain why I'm going to explain why I don't think it's two of the top people that keep being listed.

**Norman Osborn**
Norman Osborn seems to be the most popular pick. But here is why that doesn't make sense:

-Disappearing act: Osborn doesn't hide in the shadows of a prison cell. And he certainly doesn't have the ability to disappear. Even if he did it's just not his shtick. Osborn wouldn't pop out of the shadows. He'd walk into the visitor's lounge with an entourage of guards. Why? Because he's one of the most politically powerful men in New York. He has no reason to sneak around.

-Looks: Whoever was in that cell had aged hands and wild unkept hair. Osborn is a business stiff with a clean cut who's roughly in his 40s maybe even late 30s. Appearances are important to Osborn. He wouldn't be that shaggy. Even if he was sick


**Electro**
People seem to be guessing him because of the lightning bolt before and after the man is in the cell. But here is why I don't believe it's Electro.

-No sign of lightning entering the cell: When Electro enters a room he enters the fucking room. There are no scorch marks. No smoke. The man himself generates no electricity. And when he disappears the camera is even facing him at the time. No lightning bolt carrys him away. Just the light itself.

-He looks NOTHING like electro. For one thing: Electro is [bald](http://i.imgur.com/HxxuO.jpg)

-His career doesn't match. He's an electrical engineer. Not a scientist. Certainly not a guy with any expertise in cross species genetics. There is almost nothing that would make him work directly with Connors and Richard. 

So that's why I think almost everyone is wrong with those 2 choices. But here is why I'm right 

**Morbius:**

-Morbius is a living vampire. It would make sense for him to be in the shadows. Especially if he's hiding from Osborn.

-He's a scientist

-The looks match. Long black jacket. Aged hands. Long shaggy hair.

-One of the camera angles strangely focused on Connor's neck. Was this what Morbius was focused on

What do you guys think of my theory?

Hey guys I am TOTALLY stoked for The Amazing Spider-Man 2! Electro, and Mary Jane all being added to the mix from Amazing Spider-Man 1 sounds like it will be a blast. I posted just after The Amazing Spider-Man how I thought the movie would go, now with all of this information I want to present my updated thoughts on how it could go.
Based on all casting knowledge and such we know that Electro, who's character hasn't been revealed yet. I have a strong feeling Colm Feore will be playing Norman Osborne, he would fit the profile of the man we saw at the end of ASM in the shadows, and there's no way they aren't going to introduce the character by this point in the game.

Rhino, where he doesn't necessarily give each and every villain a full origin and extensive character arc. Peter Parker is the star of the show and that's what I think is the focus from here out. I can see Rhino being a villain used at the opening of the movie, sort of as an introductory action set piece to bring us up to speed on Peter Parker

Electro will be awesome, as in we will see some form of origin and resolution to his character, I'm still curious as to how much of the movie will be focused on Electro. Which brings me to my next point, because I have a feeling that the final showdown of the movie will not be with Electro, but the Green Goblin.

I think that Electro will be the central protagonist of the movie for sure, ending with the death of Gwen Stacy. You may be thinking WOW this sounds like an awful lot to fit into a movie, but trust me this isn't even the half of it… 

This is because I also have a feeling that the black suit, will become Venom. This is why. The synopsis describes that Harry Osborne is an old childhood friend of Peter's, very much like Eddie Brock in the Ultimate Universe. Harry Osborne could serve to provide Peter with some insight into the kind of work his father did, and would also explain a potential relationship between Norman Osborne and his father (which was hinted at at the end of ASM). The black suit could also be what causes Spider-Man to make a poor decision leading to Gwens death at his own hands. The movie could then end with Harry finding out that Peter did in fact take the symbiote, when Peter goes to get rid of it, and Harry getting mighty mad about this and eventually bonding with it just like in Ultimate Spider-Man. The after the credits bit could then be a nice set up for the Venom spin off.

I wouldn't just make the assumption that Venom and the black suit is in the movie out of thin air though

Here is a picture of where the symbiote was stored in Ultimate Spider-Man: 

http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news/35583/_1360201279.jpg

Now here's a tweet that Marc Webb tweeted out on February 6

https://twitter.com/MarcW/status/299315202447536128/photo/1

The tweet has the hashtag #happybirthday. February 6 is Dane DeHaans birthday

So how do I think the movie will progress? We will be brought up to speed after a battle between Spider-Man and Rhino on what Peter has been up to the past few months of being a hero. Peter meets Harry who tells him that their parents used to work together. Electro shows up causing all sorts of trouble, fights Electro again, stops him for good maybe? During all this time Norman Osborne is being established as a rising threat. Finally there is a showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin (Norman already knows that Peter is Spider-Man, and can use knowledge of this to use Gwen hostage against him). Spider-Man in haste makes a poor decision that causes for Gwen to die at his own hands and the Green Goblin to get away. Peter gets rid of the symbiote, which finds its way to Harry.

Of course my analysis is only looking into the action and villain side of things

TL;DR: I think ASM2 will have Rhino, the Black suit and even Venom in it without being a bloated movie.

Just pivotal plot points and characters

Peter needs to get a job at The Daily Bugle (of course for taking pictures of Spider-Man)
There can be several motivations for Peter to need a job. With Uncle Ben gone Aunt May has been running through their savings

Eddie Brock as a character needs to be established.
Not Venom, rather than a cancer cure.
So Peter and Eddie Brock rekindle a childhood friendship, and ends up bonding with the symbiote, creates tension between Peter and Eddie, Eddie begins to resent Peter.

The Black Suit.
Hopefully it looks way cooler than it did in Spider-Man 3. Peter will be stronger

Norman Osborne becomes the Green Goblin.
Norman Osborne can be the man that has the answers Peter has been looking for about his parents and such

Mary Jane is introduced.
New girl at Peter's school sounds like an easy way to set it up. I guess she has a crush on Peter. Gwen picks up on this, or just, be careless regarding his relationship with Gwen. Again making Gwen more jealous.

Aunt May discovers Peter is Spider-Man
Either she finds out, so please lets not make her a completely oblivious character.

Gwen Stacy dies.
Peter and the Green Goblin are having their penultimate battle on the George Washington Bridge. It will end with the Green Goblin dropping a bus of children, being that Gwen Stacy dies. This happens because Peter Parker catches the bus of children, and shoots a web to catch Gwen Stacy, however she is falling too fast, and this snaps her neck on impact.
First off Peter fights this battle wearing the black suit, open to suggestions as to how the black suit leads to Gwen being captured).

Peter gets rid of the symbiote.
Seeing as how the black suit has made him a darker and more reckless character, throws it away somehow, again, suggestions).

Final Battle with Green Goblin.
Peter back in the red and blues goes for a final showdown with the Green Goblin. I don't know how this should go down, and he tells Peter about his father. Gives a bit more resolution to the story of Peter's parents, while still leaving some points to be explored further in the sequel.

The ending.
Gwens funeral, Mary Jane is Peter's shoulder to cry on, naturally in the third movie this could develop into a romance. No need to rush it though.

After the Credits Stinger
Shot of Eddie somehow getting the Symbiote, and then we see him quickly transform into Venom and a cut to black.
I'm obviously biased, we can finally have the Spider-Man and Venom showdown movie we have always wanted in the Amazing Spider-Man 3.

Also a couple things I think I should mention. I think it would be best to not have Harry Osborne in the franchise

Also I know some people may not like the idea of Gwen's character dying in the second movie and leaving it for the third movie, and also serves as the perfect motivation for Peter to abandon the black suit.

I know I haven't fleshed out too many of the plot points

This is about a possible theory behind the man in the shadows in the after credits scene of ASM that I haven’t seen else ware.

- WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID

First I will go over what had already been sad a year ago
The first reaction of many was its Norman Osborn because of the hat he was carrying around while not showing his face similar to the old comics
in addition to appearing ill as Osborn was said to be earlier in the movie. This has been stated false by Rhys Ifans “It’s not Norman Osborn. But it is someone who is in the employ of Norman Osborn without question…Who knows? Maybe he will be the next bad guy; we’ll see.”
”(LINK) A year later it has already been announced Chris Cooper will be portraying Norman. 
	Another idea many had was that Electro was hinted at because of the lightning. While Electro is the films next antagonist and an employee of Oscorp
	Going with what Ryan Ifans said about the character being an employee of Oscorp, the Scorpion, Kraven the Hunter, and Rhino (also has an actor Paul Giamatti). The man in the shadows will be a scientist.
	Based on the dialogue the Man in The Shadows worked with Dr. Connors and Peter’s Dad, Shocker, and Vulture whose fields have nothing to do with genetics. I also exclude Smyth because they agreed not to reuse characters used in the ASM video game. Morbius is owned by owners of Blade(Marvel) so, he isn’t really worth considering. 
	
- MY THEORY

The only geneticist I can think of left, AKA The Jackal. Before you shoot it down with “I REALLY HATE CLONES and 90s writing!!! It also enforces my theory of VENOM’s origin and eventual solo movie. More on that in section 3.
I hated the clone saga just as much as others who have read it, in may have meant something when Gwen said “Two of my teachers showed up.” (to the funeral) Miles later became The Jackal (ASM#129, exactly 1 year after Gwen Died, whose death put him into the depression that caused him to turn himself into the Jackal). Jackal does not mean clone saga, but based on the version of Richard Parker and the Clone Saga from Brian Bendis’s Ultimate Spider-man, I have an Idea how Venom can be introduced and brought into his own movie, without being disappointing.

- HOW THIS OPENS UP TO A VENOM ORIGIN TIE IN

Venom has many origins; the first cannot be redone because it was from a machine found during the secret wars (Which includes so many characters nobody holds the rights to them). In the nineties cartoon the symbiote came from a rock on the moon, in search of a cure for cancer. Sound familiar? Richard even based the symbiote on his own DNA. This is similar to the idea that Peter’s powers were only triggered by the spider bite and were embedded in him as an experiment, which likely was cut from the movie to be released in future installments (We can only hope. Unless that whole thing just gets shot to hell) . See here for the THE UNTOLD STORY. These connections suggest that Venom and Spider-man were the result of connected experiments, which could in the future be used as a reason for venom having spider like powers and being attracted to him without ever having to bond with him in the first place, and Parker DNA may be he key to both, which is what the Jackal has been known to obsess about in the past.
	In the ultimate comics, who may fit as well as The Jackal, but I feel the Jackal fits the silhouette better.

The Ultimate Clone Saga is the closest Spider-man ever comes to finding his father

First off I'll say that this is the best intro to a Spiderman game

What are the best parts of the game?

- Web rush (it really is the star of this game)
- The story is actually really awesome
- The interesting characters (the guy who plays spidey is fantastic)
- The games intro
- Web Slinging
- Web zip/rush combined into ""Spider Parkour""
- The outdoor graphics
- Side missions (there are tons of these things)
- The variety in the missions
- Lack of repetitive gameplay
- The stealth
- Character relationships

And sooooo much more!

I enjoyed every minute of this game (not EVERY minute really, at one stage ""someone"" mentions a cross species Bat/man and Peter says something like ""Half Bat half man! A Batman? Come on thats ridiculous!"" Even though I am a huge Batman fan, that comment made me laugh.

Now this isn't a perfect game

- The indoor graphics are quite often pretty choppy
- Lots of jagged edges indoors (No doubt fixed with a PC release)
- Sometimes the levels (Side missions) are quite similiar
- It does give one or two MAJOR movie spoilers (which I regret hearing)
- And the loading times are SO ANNOYING! Its like a whole minute to leave your apartment

These are my only complaints with this game and lets admit that they are minor ones!

But if I were to give this game a rating of sorts it would easily be a solid 9/10... a few graphical flaws and level design stops it from being a perfect game :D

There is many several theories to who it is, Krane, and the Chameleon.  My wild theory involves none of them.  

Right away I am going to tell you who I think it is, that could possibly be Strange.  The man is depicted wearing fine clothing and a hat, also could possibly be Strange.  The man enter and exits the room pretty much by teleportation, also possibly Strange.  

Now before I get downvoted into oblivion hear me out.  You may say Strange isn't a bad guy!  This is true, Madam Web!  He tells the Lizard, ""We shall leave him alone for now.""  Who does he mean by We?  Could he mean the Lizard and himself?  Osbourne as an employer and this mysterious man? Or Madam Web and Strange?

Web and Strange have both had major interactions with Peter and could both be tied into the story with clever writing.  While this is a more outlandish theory

I'll post the second one here and if there's significant interest I'll post more. As of right now I have enough for three trilogies(9 films).

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2**- The film begins with Peter struggling to maintain his daily life while still protecting the city from crime. He continues to push Gwen away on her late father's wishes, Dr. Michael Morbius, and the leader of Oscorp's son, Harry Osborne. Morbius begins secretly working on some sort of serum and informs Harry and Gwen that he is, in fact, dying. He decides not to tell his wife, Martine

A widowed down-on-his-luck scientist working at OsCorp, and Dillon is electrocuted. Instead of being killed, however, the freak accident caused a mutagenic change in his nervous system, allowing him to generate and control vast amounts of electricity. With nowhere left to turn and no way to feed his two daughters, Dillon turns to a life of crime as the mastermind Electro.

Peter begins searching for a job in photography, Mary Jane Watson. Electro begins stealing from small time grocery stores, but soon moves onto thieving from a large bank in the area. Jameson tries to play Electro off as Spider-Man's alter-ego, which Peter tries hard to fight but is unsuccessful. The public now views Spider-Man as a criminal, and shun him. 

Gwen and Harry become close

Electro becomes angry that he is not getting the recognition he deserves, and discovers everything about him. He kidnaps Gwen and Aunt May and brings them to the Coney Island pier. As expected, Peter follows him there. A large battle ensues, until Electro shocks Spider-Man with charged energy from a transformer on the pier. Before he kills Spider-Man, Dr. Morbius shows up and pleads with Dillon not to do it, saying he is a good man and there are other ways to feed his daughters. Spider-Man notices a broken piece of the pier under him before Dillon shoots Morbius with a charged blast, seemingly killing him. Spider-Man punches the piece of the pier and intentionally falls into the ocean, shorting Dillon out and killing him. Peter takes Aunt May and Gwen back home.

The film the flashes back to all the important moments in Peter's life(him being handed over to his aunt and uncle, his first fight with the Lizard, him saying good-bye to Gwen) and reveals that Morbius has been at all those major events. it then shows a picture on Morbius's desk of Morbius and Richard Parker standing together, revealing the knew each other in some capacity. Morbius's eye opens and is now a dark red.

In the post-credits scene, Michael."" the figure says. Morbius is quiet for a while.

Originally there existed only /r/Spider_Man. But then /r/Spiderman got popular and we decided to merge these two and provide users an exclusive approach in experiencing the subreddits by only allowing the comic discussions in /r/Spider_Man and other posts in /r/Spiderman. 

But recently there has been discussions going on among the users if we really need two subs and why dont we just make a single sub for all spiderman. So i decided to take the sub's thoughts into the matter by making this poll.

Kindly take this poll for the sake of feedback and we will act accordingly. (this poll is combined for both the subs)

Thank you! :)

P.S: Kindly Upvote this post so that everyone can see! I receive no karma whatsoever.

Edit: We haven't corresponded with /r/spidey so there havent been any communication with them and please dont ask us to combine with /r/SpideyMeme since we would like to keep the memes out of this subreddit.


This poll will close on thursday midnight! :)

For those of you who don't know, I know, that sounds UGLY and brings back some bad memories.

When I first heard about this

For one, strongly resemble Sam Raimi's origin from Spider-Man 1. While it does stray from the source material, at least it will be a new and fresh take on the character.

Now onto the nitty gritty of it all.

Does this change Peter Parker or Spider-Man as a character at all? I mean, I actually rarely consider the circumstances surrounding his origin as a superhuman as part of what makes him great. His humanity, awkwardness, and his ability to discern responsible vs. irresponsible are. If this power lies dormant within him, and it's awakened with this spider bite? The idea, in and of itself, is actually one that could prove to be extremely fruitful in the progression and development of the character in this universe.

It seems as though Peter's father will be working on this revolutionary project, but alive. Peter's eventual transformation into Spider-Man and doing good and upholding the wellbeing of people was what his father dreamed of. It's actually brilliant storytelling.

Naturally

Yes, but Ben is. Just because Peter's father gives him this power, does not mean Peter will know how to use it, and that's where Uncle Ben's cruciality has always lied.

In essence

1) What was [that room called that Parker went into](/spoiler)?

and 2) Is there any [android app on the market that would mimik the operation of said lock](/spoiler)?
