1332303512.0,r6ab5,A Guide for the Newest of Us,quaunaut,249,56,93,"Okay, [how to get some quick and easy cash/faction](http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/ql04k/free_zkeys/) and [a quick(smart!) way to 30/50 HoM Points](http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/iu3qw/a_hom_guide_to_3050_aimed_at_beginners/)

So I thought I'd help out. What this guide is going to cover:

* How to properly get your Ritualist skills
* Where and how to get your 'final' gear set
* How to get a functional hero group working as soon as possible
* How to farm Jade Quarry so you can get skills/faction ASAP
* A few links to things people haven't mentioned
* How do educate yourself from here on out

---
**Step Zero: Before you Start**

Some baseline things to help you out:

* Unlock your Xunlai Chest. Right now. No

* Buy bags with your money. The only thing that gets priority over bags is skills. You'll get 2 bags

*Always carry at least a basic Salvage Kit and Identification Kit on you. Always.

* Identify everything that can be. Often enough they'll get 'improved sale value' which is badass.

* Salvage everything that is a salvage item

* Sell everything else

* ALWAYS USE THE WIKI ON MISSIONS. EVERY TIME. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION



---
**Step One: Building your first bar

Okay

First, I'd be pretty horrible(well, as horrible as one would be at the beginning). But anytime I get an Elementalist Hero, or if I was to make a PvP-only Elementalist? I'd be able to roflstomp things pretty hard. That's because I've unlocked those skills.

However, while you get the others required?

You should be able to relatively 'start' with these abilities, or by buying them from skill trainers:

[*Pain*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Pain): Generic damage spirit. You'll always want this.

[*Bloodsong*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bloodsong): Damage/lifesteal spirit. You'll always want this.

[*Painful Bond*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Painful_Bond): Thing to make your spirits do more damage. You'll always want this

[*Boon of Creation*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Boon_of_creation): You'll want this until you get to Eye of the North proper and start making yourself into the State of the Heroes build.

[*Shadowsong*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shadowsong): You'll want this about as long as you want Boon of Creation

So those are your long term, last you'll get rid of first.

[*Spirit Boon Strike*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spirit_Boon_Strike): Holy potatoes, hell, I was tempted to replace Shadowsong with it(don't do that).

[*Splinter Weapon*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Splinter_Weapon): Cool ability your heroes will be using quite a bit of later on. Great for packs

[*Mighty Was Vorizun*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mighty_Was_Vorizun): Despite being named after a misspelled phone company, switch it out with this.

Okay! Those should last you while you get everything you need to get.  With all of these

For the record

---
**Step Two: Once You're on the Mainland**

Suddenly, you have a few priorities.

1. Get M.O.X. outside. Go out the Bukdek Byway exit, idunno. Yes, just get him, no he won't be in your final group, however he's a badass buddy to have for beforehand and arguably one of the most blatantly useful heroes.

2. Get the quests for [Nightfall](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Sunspears_in_Cantha) and [Eye of the North](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/I_Feel_the_Earth_Move_Under_Cantha%27s_Feet).

3. Check Michiko there for skills in Kaineng Center. She's near the NorthEast corner of the map.

Now

[*Agony*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Agony): Quite frankly, after acquiring Gwen.

[*Summon Spirits*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Summon_Spirits): Well, most useful abilities you have. Changes your quality of life instantly. It's just as amazing as it sounds.

&gt; Re: Summon Spirits...

Thanks [Nefara Molantsu](http://www.reddit.com/user/Nefara) for this suggestion!

Essentially, you'll want to skip to Step Four temporarily, specifically the PvP part. Do Jade Quarry and change your Imperial Faction to whatever Kurzick/Luxon faction your guild is with(I don't know if all the Reddit guilds match here). Remember, you have a max of around 10k right now. Next, find a [Kurzick Bureaucrat](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kurzick_Bureaucrat) or a [Luxon Scavenger](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Luxon_Scavenger), and donate the points to your guild. It'll build your title up at twice the rate, getting you to Title Rank 1 sooner

[*Signet of Spirits*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Signet_of_spirits) The strongest ability a Ritualist ever gets. We usually don't unequip it for anything, then hunting down [this dickhead](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wagg_Spiritspeak), killing him, and using the capture signet by his Corpse, and selecting the ability.

* Stated weapon damage assumes you  have 12 mastery in the attribute regardless of the item req. You do ~9% less damage for every point you are short. (The actual number is the 8th root of two. So, but to a lesser extent. The bonus for exceeding 12 is only 40% as strong as the penalty for not meeting it. As such, having 14 in a weapon attribute will do 107.2% of stated damage. 16 will do 114.9%.

* Hitting with an attack actually happens halfway through the animation. Those 1/2 second bow interrupts actually loose the arrow at 1/4 sec.

1328341508.0,pafmz,State of The Heroes Address,iamablackbeltman,177,44,117,"**Preface**

I come to you today with many notable revisions to the previous hero builds I have posted. They have been spurred by several things, and excel spreadsheets...so many excel spreadsheets. I aim to explain why I chose to use the skills I have chosen, as well as the gear. *It looks as though I won't have time to talk about the gear tonight, so I'll add that in tomorrow.*

**Previous Versions**

The least potent of my three previous versions, the damage sustained is sizeable. It is not nearly as idiot-proof as it once was, and I am removing my endorsement from it. That is not to say it is bad, just that it is not exemplary. 

My previously released Fromway is still completely viable

Blackway was, too is still completely viable.

[**My Current Hero Team**](http://i.imgur.com/hlR5Y.png)

The first thing you will notice about this team is it includes a bar for the player. This bar is important for the team to function correctly. I have removed the ST shelter rit from play, however, not be a paragon or warrior because they have insufficient energy regeneration \*.

\* If you absolutely must use one of these two professions

**Breaking Down The Player Bar**

Template Code: OwhiAyiMRDWN5D+NVOdNBNJXC

The most powerful Ritualist elite is SoS. Being able to summon 3 level 10 spirits (200 health and 63 armor) for free is incredibly overpowered. It is the basis of any spirit spammer bar

Vampirism is also a phenominal spirit (assuming max rank). It lasts for Two and a half minutes, and is very durable (280 health and 87 armor).

Pain and Bloodsong (200 health and 63 armor each) were chosen because of their energy cost. There was no room on this bar for energy gaining skills

Painful bond is on the bar if you need a burst of extra damage. It is too expensive to spam

Armor of Unfeeling is necessary because, spirits have pretty solid armor. However, they are of very low level. This means they are subject to a significantly increased chance of being hit by a critical hit. This skill negates that aspect.

Summon Spirits. What use are spirits that you can't take with you? Also: healing. You want your spirits alive. There are very few spells that heal your spirits. This is one of them. I would advise cranking up your faction title to r10+ to realize the benefit.

The last skill, which is nice because AoE causing foes are good to get rid of quickly.

**Breaking Down The Monk Bar**

Template Code: OwUTAHHHYynBBMPz6TNi6zlQAA

RoJ is a fantastic elite if used on stationary foes (casters). For maximum efficiency, it will do 338 damage, ignoring armor. 

Smite Hex and Smite Condition are both there because, Rit based healers are terribad on hex removal. This rectifies that situation.

Spear of Light has a high damage/energy ratio. As foes rarely just stand there, the bonus damage is realized often.

Castigation Signet helps balance out the energy. It functions well for the same reason Spear of Light does.

Wandering Eye and Signet of Clumsiness: Because armor ignoring AoE damage is better than a spear. And

Res Sig: because you might oops.

**Breaking Down The Panic Bar**

Template Code: OQNEAowj86QDmemumwFY5fXFA

I really wanted a Panic mesmer on the team because of what it can do to shut down a large mob. If you have ever seen it in action in a place like Urgoz

Mistrust is an obvious choice. It prevents damage to your team by stopping a spell cast at you

Unnatural Signet is free and is likely to be AoE considering how many hexes your team will be casting.

Chaos Storm is a beast of a skill. It's very cheap and outputs a ton of damage. The downside is that hero AI will not cast it upon an enemy that isn't wielding a caster weapon. As it turns out

Power Spike because 126 damage while stopping a caster is hard to beat.

Waste Not

Shield of Absorption was thrown into the mix because I couldn't find another Domination line skill that thrilled me, behind spirits) and you will see a whole bunch of zeroes hitting you. It's a good feeling.

**Breaking Down The Ineptitude Bar**

Template Code: OQNEAYwj0K9CgAmnREs8Z0EGJAA

Ineptitude is the best PvE Anti-melee skill there is. Period. Prepare to giggle at the Aatxes in UW if you're not used to having it on your bar.

Wandering Eye is cheap and has high damage. Significantly preferred to its counterpart

Signet Of Clumsiness is here because the price is right and the damage is good.

Drain enchantment assists in energy mgmt.

Waste Not

Gift of Health is a great healing prayers skill...if it's your only one, and it's energy cost is already paid for by the aforementioned skills.

Dwayna's Sorrow: because you have a MM with an 11 minion capacity

**Breaking Down The Minion Master Bar**

Template Code: OAhjYgFsoSyBbhVBoBKgYMeTVV

The most important skill here is not AotL. It is Death Nova. Minion bombers output so much damage

AotL is here because it can raise a metric shit-ton of minions in one go, hero AI will not renew this enchantment before it expires. If you want it to gain benefit from itself, you must micro it (not imperative, but nice).

Masochism is here because having 11 minions is better than having 10 minions

Bone Minions because

Putrid Bile because if you're killing a foe

Splinter Weapon and Ancestor's Rage buff the minions and make them actually do some damage while you wait for them to pop.

SoLS because spells are expensive.

**Breaking Down The Healer Bar**

Template Code: OAhiYwh8YtFeTOp5wccWVTu

Xinrae's Weapon counters spikes

Spirit Transfer because a heal of 205 is really nice to have. It has a quick recharge and cast time. Energy is not a problem due to soul reaping

Spirit Light because you don't have to worry about health sacrifice and it heals a lot.

Mend Body And Soul is a quick recharging heal with condition removal.

Protective Was ~~The Koala~~ Kaolai is a nice party-wide heal. Because it's precast

Life for AoE heals and another spirit for PI and Spirit Transfer.

Death Pact Signet because if you die often enough that the side effect is a problem

Now I'm sitting over 9

Don't have time to farm? Don't feel like it? Well

Consumables!

More specifically

**What do you need** to make a BU?

* 250g
* 50 feathers
* 50 dust
* 1 skill point

**Where do you acquire these things?** 

Kamadan. 

**Why not farm the materials yourself?**

The only reason you're still reading is you didn't want to farm. Settle down.

**What do the required materials cost?**

* stack of feathers = 9-10k

* stack of dust = ~4k

*After Canthan New Year is over. Dust prices are going to be exceptionally high until the conclusion of this event.* 

So

**How do I make the money

The beautiful part about BU's is [they sell for 3.5-4k each](http://argos-soft.net/GwEstimator/index.php?search=BU). They cost you ~2.9k to make. That means you are netting 600-1100g per skill point that you have.

**Ahh, I don't have that many skill points!**

Easily fixable.

[This is a map of the Gate of Madness mission

If you have done this mission before

**I sense you laying out a plan. What is it?**

You are going to leave the first portal you come across alive, this takes 10-15 mins.) Then, you are going to stand on the little black mound against the wall, just downhill from the portal. [I put a green dot on the map for you!](http://i.imgur.com/UrSyJ.jpg)

That way, but you are far enough back that you will not kill the portal. Then, you afk. Your heroes kill the monsters, and you can do other, more important real life things. Because you're standing there, you get exp. More exp means more skill points. More skill points mean more BUs. More BUs mean more money.

**How much money?**

Well, which when killed spawn Pain Titans. Those spawn two Madness Titans each when killed. All of these monsters are level 28 in NM (30 in HM). Let's say you have shitty heroes and can't do HM. That results in your team killing 16 level 28s every minute. Level 28's yield 	232 exp when killed, divided by the number of team members (in this case, probably 8). That's 464 exp per minute. Or, 27,840 exp per hour.

**But wait

Pop a [Scroll of Berserker's Insight](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Scroll_of_Berserker%27s_Insight) for triple the exp! It will never run out because the spawns are every 30 seconds. Now, and you aren't doing a thing.

**Get to the platinum talk already!**

That much exp translates to 5.568 skill points per hour. Remember, you're earning 3k per hour.

*That's terrible!*

But you aren't actually doing anything

**What's that going to buy me?**

Let's pretend you play Guild Wars 7 hours per day (you probably don't). That means there's 17 hours per day you don't play Guild Wars. That translates into 50k/day of afk money. That's 350k/week

**Now

Hard Mode will net you 32.76% more experience.

The celebration is for players to gather, give away surplus items for HoM-seekers, etc... At this point, it seems to me that it will be open-ended, and we can further organise if needed.

I'd like to suggest that the event begin at 18:00 (6:00PM) Pacific Standard Time on August 24, and I can adjust it.

The main decision we have to make is where to meet. I'd like to propose the following: anybody who has an outpost in mind can nominate one in the comments. In about 24 hours, then we'll vote using the [Schulze method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) to decide on the location. (It's a type of ranked-voting system; I can give more instructions when it gets to this point.) If there are significantly more, then we will do a round of [Approval Voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) and select the top five most popular candidates. We'll pass those over to the Schulze method to choose the final location.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions about this. I look forward to seeing you guys in game before the launch!

**Update**: A few people are suggesting that the times are a little bit too strange for certain zones. Should we just set a location to meet

In addition, any Eye of the North outpost. I'll continue to put down the nominations, but please keep it in mind during the first round of voting. (I'll also make note of it again at that time.)


**Update 2**: This post has an outpost selection follow-up [here](http://redd.it/ydrrj).
