Threads just full of angry fans, and we are the worst 12-3 team ever. Manage your expectations, people. I dealt with this shitter of a team for 10 fucking years, and in its best year yet, we apparently are only capable of losing three games. That's it, forget the wins, and forget the stats that make Kubiak one of the best offensive coaches in the league, no front office move will make this team any better

Also, even if it was our worst yet, you all neglect to acknowledge that the reason it looks so bad is because we are use to consistent success from Kubiaks offense. You think the Bears or Steelers balk when they only put up six points? We are all spoiled brats, and I can't stand the way we're acting when we lose. Remember how annoying it was hearing a Pats fan bitch about his team when the Texans had 4 wins? Yeah, try your own medicine Houston. Try telling anyone from San Diego or New York that our coach sucks, and get a little perspective.

Sorry for the rant, that were obviously not there when we *did* actually suck.",,False,self,t5_2s450,False,,

The reason I am here is quite simple, football, basketball, soccer, etc.  DeAndre and I have remained friends throughout college at Clemson University, and this entire town, in just a couple of days, the whole town knew he would eventually end up in either the NBA or NFL. NBA actually seemed more likely

There is really one thing you all need to know about ""Nuk"", faster, and stronger than him, but Nuk will come down with the ball, smile and trot back to the huddle. He has a winners mentality, knows he is the best, and acts like in on the field. 

Just a few tips, i hope to hear that on the TV next sunday!

As a Dutch Texans fan I had searched through all the Dutch TV companies to find that single company who aired NFL games. After some thorough researched I found the ESPN channel for Europe (ESPN America) and took a subscription. After a while I realised that ESPN is in love with that other Texas team and the birds from Philadelphia and doesn't air Texans games live and doesn't air them re-live until Tuesday.

So I was back to square one and week 4. So I searched Google and found this gem of a subreddit and found my way to some 'less then legal' online-streams. So I watched a couple of games this way

I needed something better. So I decided to pull out my wallet again and get NFL Gamepass

Fast forward to last Sunday 7PM (that's when the game starts for me). So I was all set to watch Texans history. First half was bad. I was really getting anxius. Second half gets underway, Texans start to dominate but I see the clock winding down. Now I'm getting nervous. 2:33, no time-outs and Yates pulls out that superb drive. And then that TD-pass to Walter. ROOOOAAAAAR! I must have yelled all kind of things for quite a bit because my voice is a bit hoarse. I didn't care it was past 10 PM on a Sunday. I didn't care no one around here knows what 'American Hand-Egg' is. I didn't care I was probably the only person in a thousand mile radius who watched that game. All I knew was that the Texans won!

Now

Lets hope I can roar a few more time.",self,t5_2s450,True,,texans,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/n9kqd/a_big_roar_from_across_the_pond/

Simply put

I mean

Kubiak failed to prepare the team

**It's not time to fire Kubiak...** Yet. 

I'm of the firm belief that Kubiak is the reason we're where were at right now as a franchise. Regardless of what he does *in game*

What i'm saying is that **Bob McNair needs to light a fire under Kubiak's ass**. This is one of those moments where McNair should pull Kubiak aside in private and explain perfectly clear why it's time to adjust his offensive philosophy to fit the team

Wade makes his living adjusting his defense to the skills of his players

 Kubiak needs to do the same as well. it's time to switch from setting up the play action off the run

take a moment and ask yourself:

What the fuck is going to happen after the playoffs

This year, but for some reason in the big games, we're out coached by miles. That doesn't make me very confident for the post season.

1352307454.0,12sz4c,The Green Bay Packers Guide to Beating the Bears,corduroyblack,53,16,42,"Having watched every Bears game for the last several seasons

**1. Rattle Jay Cutler Early**: I have no doubt that the Texans will be able to do this. Cutler is a talented and elite-capable QB, Cutler has only thrown for 300 yards on 4 occassions**. If the Bears fall behind, it's doubtful Cutler can dig them out. Cutler has a penchant for getting frustrated from sacks and throwing INTs as well. He simply doesn't have the game maturity to throw the ball away if he can't get the ball to where he wants it to go. The Bears can counter this by giving him options to dumping off passes if his first reads are not open. Watch for screens to Matt Forte and Michael Bush. Forte is the #2 receiver on the team (a distant second to Brandon Marshall).

**2.  Take away Brandon Marshall as an Option**: Jay Cutler relies on Brandon Marshall to an extreme amount. Cutler's targeting of Marshall is greater than his targeting of all other WRs and TEs *combined*. Games that the Bears won by the largest margin of victory (+15 points) were all games in which Marshall had over 7 catches and +100 yards. The Bears's one loss to the Packers? Marshall had 2 catches for 24 yards and Cutler was sacked 7 times. In watching that game

**3. Use power running to tire the Bears defense and rack up first downs**: There's no beating around the bush. The Bears have a great defense. But that being said, the games have been extremely close.  Those games excluded, the Packers, Lions and Panthers all had close games with the Bears. 

**4. Don't Turn the Ball Over.** The Bears offense needs all the help it can get. The Bears have forced at least 2 TOs in every game this year. When there have been 2 TOs or less, and barely beat a weak offensive opponent (Rams). Charles Tillman is the main threat here. His tackling is designed to knock out fumbles. This can be effectively countered by power running directly at him. He is successful because RBs and WRs are attempting to avoid tackling. Don't bother with that. Pounding Arian Foster directly into Tillman's face could well lead to broken tackles and a frustated Bears defense. **You can't be afraid of him**, as that response plays directly into his strategy to go for fumble recoveries. If the Texans don't turn the ball over and can get first downs, I don't see any way they don't win the ball game.

**TL;DR:**

**1. Sack Jay Cutler**

**2.  Cover Brandon Marshall**

**3. Run the Ball**

**4. Limit Turnovers**

1369493935.0,1f14vi,Warning: Homer alert. All of the following opinions may be influenced in varying degrees by my extreme bias towards the Texans. That said is anyone else ridiculously excited about the Texans 2013 Defense?,C0rnNuttz,35,6,24,"**Starting D-Line:**  
Earl Mitchell (NT) - In his third year in the league (2012) he split time with Shaun Cody (now injured and still unsigned) but secured the starting spot for the final 3 games of the season. Even with limited playing time he racked up 31 tackles, and a forced fumble.  
Antonio Smith (DT) - Returning for his fourth year as a starter, 7 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles, somehow didn’t get him into the 2012 Prow Bowl despite a 2011 Pro Bowl appearance with less impressive stats. His nickname is the Ninja Assassin. He said he became a ninja by taking an online course but he doesn’t use the full extent of his ninja powers because it wouldn’t be fair to the other players… crazy but in a good way.  
J.J. Watt (DT) – If I need to explain this one you should not be reading this.   
**Starting Linebackers:**  
 Whitney Mercilus (OLB) - The Texans first pick in the 2012 draft, 6 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. Also Mercilus (Mercy-less) is a badass name.  
Brooks Reed (OLB) – In his second season he suffered a bit of a sophomore slump (maybe due to an injury costing him 4 games) but still managed to record 27 tackles, 3 passes defended and a forced fumble. His third year should be more reminiscent of his rookie season, hopefully. He also has long, flowing, blond hair like Clay Matthews. And like Clay, that is where he derives his power.  
Darryl Sharpton (ILB) – His recklessness and complete disregard for his body is really exciting to watch. However, 2 passes defended, and an interception.  
Brian Cushing (ILB) – The 2009 Defensive Rookie of the Year, May 20th: “My return is right around the corner… I can definitely tell you I will be ready for the first game of the season.” And some have been nothing short of frightening (for Texans opponents), April 16th: “There’s gonna be no barrier to hold me back. Been through a lot this year mentally, physically and I think a lot of that pain and aggression will come out. That’s the driving force… and when it’s go time I’m gonna be there.”  
**Starting Secondary:**  
Kareem Jackson (CB) – After an abysmal rookie season in 2010 Jackson has steadily improved and got snubbed for the Pro Bowl in 2012 (see Homer disclaimer above). You may argue with the Pro Bowl snubbing but it’s hard to argue with these numbers: 53 tackles, 4 picks, and a TD.  
Jonathan Joseph (CB) – In 14 2012 games Joseph had 57 tackles, 2 interceptions and a touchdown which earned him a Pro Bowl selection. His numbers, while good, aren’t mind blowing, but that’s mostly because offensive coordinators and quarterbacks don’t like to throw at him. Texans fans will remember the great Asomugha vs. Joseph free agent debate during the 2011 offseason. Turns out the Texans front office made the right choice (Sorry Eagles).   
Danieal Manning (SS) – Coach Philips likes to use Manning to keep offenses confused and moves him all over the field. In 2012, 1 sack, 8 passes defended, 2 interceptions and a touchdown. He has a girl’s name but I think that only fuels his rage.  
Ed Reed (FS) – Hip surgery debacle notwithstanding
**Non Starters:**  
D.J. Swearinger (FS) – This ball hawking
Bryan Braman and Tim Dobbins (LBs) – Both had decent 2012 seasons as backups and special teams players. Braman was the Special Teams Alternate to the Pro Bowl and is completely nuts. Some of you will remember the solo tackle on a punt return he made helmetless and bleeding in 2011. They will allow Wade to play with the line-up of the linebacking corps. Brooks Reed is learning some ILB in OTAs…  
Ditto for draft picks Sam Montgomery and Trevardo Williams (LBs).  
Shane Lechler (P) – I debated whether to put Lechler in here but he is arguably one of the greatest defensive weapons the Texans will have. In 2012 he averaged 47.2 yards per punt with 21 of 81 inside the 20. So even when Kubiak has overly conservative play calling and Schaub underthrows his receivers or checks to the flat on 3rd and long the defense will still have long fields to work with most of the time.  
**In conclusion:** 6 former Pro Bowlers, and Joseph); plenty of talent available. 8 returning starters and 8 players entering their third or fourth season with the Texans means it’s a young squad who have had time to gel and absorb Wade’s philosophies. Lots of good draft picks will allow Wade to play with the defensive schemes (Think 3-3-5 with Swearinger playing a Linebacker-Safety hybrid).

+ The Colts do not have a 2nd round pick (they traded to Dolphins for Vontae Davis)
+ Saints do not have a 2nd round pick (Bontygate forfeiture) 
+ The Jaguars have the #2 overall pick this year.
+ This will be the loweset the Texans have ever drafted before.
+ The Chiefs and the Jaguars will alternate picks each round (Chiefs pick 1st in the 1st round

* Jets - Jets are in almost complete disarray.
* Packers - Lost to the Seahawks (Admittedly bad call
* Ravens - Defense has lost a step or two for sure and we get them at home
* Bills - true colors are coming out
* Bears - Bears got off last night on MNF but they took advantage of turnovers from Tony Romo.  Schaub is not prone to that at all
* Jaguars - Please
* Lions - Lions are perhaps the most poorly coached team in the NFL
* Titans - Please
* Patriots - Only one that is giving me slight pause.  Will have to see how they are doing in 10 weeks
* Colts - Please
* Vikings - Playing well now but looks like more smoke and mirros
* Colts - Please

At most I see 2 losses on here.  Patriots

i do have a couple of concerns though

* Arian Foster - Too many touches so far and whatever the issue is, the diet, his weight.  Whatever it is, he is not hitting the hole the same and a couple of times Sunday it looked like he was avoiding contact and looking for the sideline.
* Special Teams - Holliday has yet to hit a big one but has made some mental errors.  Shane Graham has been less than impressive
* Running D - We are giving up too much on Run D.  luckily noone has been ahead by enough to try to grind it out, Vikings and maybe Packers.

The defense is playing admirably

**So what's wrong

I just thought of a theory

We all know Schaub is a more than competent passer. He fits the scheme well physically. But, they generally lose (one recent exception is the JAX game this year).

Back in 2010, the team would collapse under the pressure. Stuff like throwing a huge interception at the last second in the end zone, or batting a deep ball into the hands of a reciever. you get it.

I had come to a belief that after our historic 2011 season

I think I was wrong. My theory is that, and thus, still infects the Offense. The offense is capable of being a destructive machine of running and passing like in 2011/10/09, but is terminally ill.

The difference between 2011/12 and the years before is the defense. The players are wildly different than in 2010 and the scheme is completely new. Paired with a new set of defensive playmakers, It allows us to win just two or three more games a year.

The solution? the offense needs a breath of fresh air. Maybe as ideal as Schaub is to QB this system, confident leader. I think signing an extension to Schaub was a huge mistake.

Sam Montgomery was projected to be [a 1st or 2nd round pick](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/23/sam-montgomery-nfl-combine-effort-draft/1941787/) in the 2013 NFL Draft. He played a 4-3 DE in college

He has rationalized why it was okay to do the things he admitted to doing. 

[On betting:](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/23/montgomery-admits-bets-with-mingo-lack-of-effort-at-lsu/) 

&gt;“Here’s the thing: Hard work,” Montgomery said. “That’s actually motivating me and Mingo. It’s not about the money, it’s about pushing us, at the combine and the drills in between. That’s what is pushing us to be the best.

&gt;“It’s always been competitive for me and Mingo and it makes us better in the end. He’s a fast defensive end

[On lack of effort:](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/23/montgomery-admits-bets-with-mingo-lack-of-effort-at-lsu/)

&gt;“When you are a young, you do things as a man,” he said. “From a maturing standpoint, and from everything going into this league that I have learned so far, I was a boy in college, and now that I am going into the league, I’ve become a man.”

[On whether he'll give 100% effort in the NFL](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/23/montgomery-admits-bets-with-mingo-lack-of-effort-at-lsu/)

&gt;“Of course, small divisions, it is all Alabamas and LSUs every week. **It’s definitely something I have to get adjusted to**, but I’m sure with the right coaching I will be fine.”

That said

Here's his [NFL page](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2013/profiles/sam-montgomery?id=2540149) - a 71.4 rating indicates an 'eventual starter'.

___________________________________________________________

Round One: [Alec Ogletree](http://draftbreakdown.com/players/alec-ogletree) ILB

Recently mocks have him going in the early twenties as some teams above us desperately need linebackers. If can drop to us it would be amazing to see him play along side Cushing next season. When he signed with Georgia he was a safety but coaches were impressed with his speed and bulk and saw him moved to LB. He has good coverage abilities and can match up against tight ends. He was suspended for the first 4 games of the season due to violating Georgia's controlled substance policy but still ended up leading the team with 111 tackles.

Round 2: Da'Rick Rogers WR

1st round talent that tested positive for drugs in his junior got him suspended indefinitely from Tennessee and transferred to Tennessee Tech. 6-foot-3 and weighing in 206 lbs he has the ability to run deep and play physical. We've been lacking a #2 option for awhile and this year has shown it. Andre racked up 1600 yds but Kevin Walter, had 6 games over 100 yds and earned SEC-All Honors. While his speed and size combo is similar to Julio Jones, his toughness is excellent and absorbed huge collisions while making the grab.

Round 3: [Bacarri Rambo](http://draftbreakdown.com/players/bacarri-rambo) S

Fitting with a last name like Rambo he reminds me of Seattle's hard-hitting talented safeties. Rambo has posted 16 interceptions over his career and seems to have a knack to lower the boom to receivers but he doesn't lower his head so he doesn't draw the flag. His aggressive style has lead to some missed tackles but that can be fixed. Very smart at reading the QB's vision and times his jumps and contact nicely to break up the play. He was the last line of defense for Georgia's stellar defense. A safety like him could eliminate playing times of Demps and Keo.

Round 3(Compensatory Pick): Brennan Williams OT

Before missing the rest of the season due to a torn labrum Williams was projected to be a late first round pick. He helped his team to rush over 2300 yds this season averaging almost 200 yards a game on the ground. He is surprisingly quick on his feet and sets the lane for his running backs to the right. Texans have had a spotty right o-line and struggled to carry Foster over 3.9 ypc for a good majority of the season. Williams could help with that.

Round 4: Kwame Geathers NT

NT for years has been our weakest link in our front 7. Shaun Cody was not the answer to stop running backs and open up holes for our LBs to exploit and was overpowered quickly. A 6-foot-6 355 lbs Geathers could solve that. While overshadowed by John Jenkins

Round 5: Michael Mauti OLB

Too many LBs can never hurt. Mauti ranks 7th in Big 10 in tackles

Round 6: Levine Toilolo TE

Another project that can be very interesting if he pans out. Measuring at 6-foot-8 he was behind a great duo of tight ends at Stanford. This pick is more for potential than for numbers running up only 400 yards. Also he fails to finish his blocks in the run game that could have possibly impacted the loss against Notre Dame.

Round 6(Compensatory Pick): Sam Brenner OG/OT

Texans love to draft project offensive linemen and Brenner fits that definition. At Utah he played both positions so the flexibility is a nice thing. He fits our zone blocking scheme perfectly and can get to the second level and open up some lanes. His work ethic and determination are a plus.

Round 7: Ryan Allen P 

Allen led the nation in punting this season with an average of 48 yds per punt and leads the nation in net punting with a net punting average of 43 yds. He also booted the longest punt this season with an 85-yard kick. Over 44 percent of his punts this season have landed inside the 20 and over 46 percent of his punts have gone over 50 yards. He also became the first player to ever win the Ray Guy Award (nation’s top punter) in back-to-back years. He can serve as replacement for Donnie Jones.

**The contest**: 

Predict the Texans 2013 NFL Draft Class

**The Prize**: 

Reddit Gold to the Top 5 entries. And Bragging Rights. Possibly a unique Draft Winner Flair next to your username.

***

**The Rules**:

1. Submit your prediction to this thread by **April 24th

2. **The 5 entries with the most points** wins Reddit Gold.

3. Each entry shall consist of the **NAME** of the **first** player the Texans select (No matter the round), worth 5 points each and the **SIDE OF THE BALL** of the remaining 6 players (worth 2 points each).

4. Ties will be broken in order of earliest incorrect answer. So if you have the first pick correct and none of the rest, they will beat someone who had picks 1 and 3 correct

5. Only submit one entry. If a user is discovered to have submitted multiple entries

6. Please note that this is picking the players selected in a certain order, the player selected in the 2nd will still count as the first player selected, no matter the round. Make sense? Good.

**The Format**: 

Submit your post in the following format (Make sure you follow this format!):

 1. JJ Watt, School, and Position for the first pick)

 2. Inside Linebacker (position only for the second and third picks)

 3. Offensive Tackle (still position only for the second and third picks)

 4. Defense (side of the ball for all subsequent picks)

 5. Offense

 6. Offense

 7. Defense

 8. Offense

 9. Defense


***

**Additional Notes**: 

* Please make sure you're specific about the position with the first three picks. Offensive Lineman or Defensive Back are not specific enough. Needs to be Offensive Tackle, Inside Linebacker, Outside Linebacker, etc. (Abbreviations like OT, C, QB, CB are fine)

* Punters and Kickers are not part of the rules.  If for some reason they take a special teams player

**Rules are subject to change!** *But probably won't unless someone points out a mistake to me*

+ Estimated 2013 NFL Salary Cap: $121
+ Texans will have 'around' $19

***

For anyone who wants Schaub cut:

Short of finding an amazing rookie QB in this years draft

He's owed:

+ $10.75 million in 2013
+ $14.5 million in 2014
+ $17 million in 2015
+ $19 million in 2016
+ Free agent in 2017

If the Texans were to cut Schaub anytime before 2016, this would count against the Texans Salary Cap figure. (that's how the Texans ended up owing DeMeco Ryans $9 million dollars this season - even though they traded him, they still owed him his signing bonus, and it became due within one year instead of being prorated over the life of the contract.).

If this is your first time playing i recommend you at least do some mock drafts at http://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/ 

It's not really fun for you when you show up on draft day lost.

Need a ***Email*** to invite you guys.

 room for nobody full.

Right now it's a 14 team league on espn. No draft set

I can create a second League if there is enough people. Right now there are 3 people.
