A prince has been promised in marriage to one of four daughters of a neighboring king. Unfortunately, but magically compelled to lie at all times; and one is both insane *and* compelled to lie. The fourth, unenchanted, princess is honest and sane. To complicate matters, they are physically identical. They can tell each other apart, but no one else can.

The prince is introduced to all four princesses at once. Of course, who are always causing trouble, he refuses to let the young man get to know them or even ask any questions. Luckily, the non-enchanted princess, being clever and having taken a liking to the prince (as well as wanting to get away from her crazy sisters), speaks a single sentence that proves beyond any doubt that she is not enchanted.

What does she say?

Edit: For further clarification, for example, ""2+2 does not equal four"" or ""the sky is not blue"", because they believe those statements to be true and therefore must deny them.

Edit 2: Here is a hint, there are other ways to combine logical statements than just ""and"".](/sp)

Edit 3: Answer time! [The sentence is ""Either I am enchanted or I have two dishonest sisters."" In order to affirm it the speaker must believe *exactly one* of its components is true (if she is honest) or believe neither or both of them are true (if she is a liar). The sane liar believes the first part is true and the second false, meaning she believes the sentence as a whole is true, so she must deny it. The insane truth-teller believes neither are true (since both are actually true from her POV) and denies it.

There are three guards stationed by the doors. One of them always tells the truth, but he doesn't know which guard is which. The prisoner is allowed *two* questions (he can ask both to one guard or one each to two separate guards). How does he get out?

edit: They have to be yes-or-no questions. Random answers randomly between ""yes"" and ""no""; he won't just say ""purple"" or anything like that. I don't think you could even solve the riddle with non-yes-or-no questions

edit2: The guards know which door is which

edit3: The guards know which guard is which

edit4: If a guard can't answer a question properly (according to their rules) with ""yes"" or ""no""

edit5: This is all in binary. The available answers are ""yes"" and ""no"". The liar can't just say ""purple"" because it's not the correct answer

(Have I covered everything yet?)

Hint 1: [Think about the goal behind each question.](/sp)

Hint 1 (more blatantly): [It's not like you have to narrow down your options; there are only two possible paths. So what does the first question do to help you?](/sp)

Hint 2: [Consider this puzzle: Two doors

A couple of months ago, nobody in the group was able to solve even the first part of it. I was hoping [1] /r/riddles would give it a shot (well, another shot) and solve it. The background of the riddle is that a man killed your parents and he left you with nothing but a riddle to find him with:

There will come a day to choose a side
and grasp the hand wrought with pride.
With clenched teeth
and silently greet you face to face.

Turn around and say my name.

Edit: Perhaps this riddle really was made too difficult. I gave some hints to them, I told them that the ""clenched teeth"" and the ""hand"" were both made of metal. 

Edit #2:  Congratulations for all who guessed [A door](/sp)  I'll give the full story about the riddle and the second part of it below.

[The player who was given this riddle controls the most intelligent character of the group - INT 22 - and it has been a running joke to say ""It's a door"" when he rolls low for a knowledge check. It happened the first time in a dungeon when he rolled for knowledge about a particular type of door and door trap. He rolled a 1, yet was never realized. Anyway, the second part of the riddle was ""Turn around and say my name,"" which, if you turn ""It's a door"" around, you get ""Rood a sti"" - Ruudasti - the murderer's name. Saying the name conjures a wrought iron door which opens to residence of the murderer.](/sp)

a third is quite general

everyone thinks that I am terrific!

we follow her around

Our second brother's moving

he commands us as if we're just as fast

also,

all that undoing redoing has got to take guts!

Our second sister likes things that connect

but for reasons unknown

perhaps it's because she's always been small

when really she leads us at times

Our third brother seems to have taken my path

but he's ever so lazy and

He sums up so much 'cause he hates wasting breath

he's done it since birth

Our third sister improves what was done by our first

as well as brother #2 (it's the worst!)

she'll even improve herself,

she brags about how many things rewrites!

Our fourth brother moves in so many ways

in, over, under, just like in a maze,

he assists brother 2 and connects him to me

he does it with joy

Sister 4 is quite loud

she leads our big group in the front

she's quite a loose cannon and curses a ton

she interrupts others and won't stop til she's done.

1358312950.0,16o2mu,Who shot Mom?,nationaltreasure,29,8,27,"As I look back on my youth, that is – a night that stands all alone in my memory. After all

The year was 1972. We were living in a small town in western Pennsylvania. There were three of us: Roger was 15 and Rory was 10. I was the middle child, it had been a while since my parents had found anyone willing to watch us. And so when we were old enough to stay home without a babysitter, my parents started to go out on Saturday evenings. They had been doing it for several years when the shooting occurred.

“Geez Carole, Mom and Dad were heading out to see a movie after dinner. As I mentioned in the beginning, every week it was the same routine. We would finish dinner around 7:45 p.m. or so. Mom would then go up and start to get ready to go out with Dad. While Mom got ready, Dad took the family dog, Misty, for a walk around the neighborhood. It was always the highlight of Misty’s week. Misty loved my Dad.

Dad and Misty made it home from their walk by exactly 8:00 p.m. so that Dad could watch Archie Bunker in “All in the Family.” He walked in the door with Misty and jetted straight toward the family room to sit on his favorite chair. “All in the Family” was the one show that Dad watched religiously – nothing came between him and that show. What’s more is that Mom made an exception to the “no food in the family room” rule – she let us have our dessert in the living room during the show.

When the second set of commercials came on at 8:17 p.m., we could set our clock by their routine.

The night that Mom was shot, but it was listed as an action thriller. Remember, Rory was only 10 years old at the time.

That night, so that everyone could help. Dad decided to make a game of it by having everyone draw cards when it came to chores. That night, Rory had drawn the low card, so he had the task of taking all of the dinner plates to the sink and clearing off the table. Whenever Rory chose the low card, he would clean off the table and then immediately take off to play outside until we dragged him in for bed. Roger drew the middle card, which meant he had the task of bringing the dessert dishes in from the family room and washing them after “All in the Family.” I picked the high card, and as a result, which hopefully would be before the start of the show. Tonight was not one of those nights though as the pots had taken a little longer and I walked in with dessert right after the opening rendition of “those were the days.”

At 8:28 p.m., Dad always gave that yell. As always, Mom answered, “I’ll be right down.” A minute or so later, Mom headed down the stairs.   Unlike normal weeks, the dishes from dessert were still in the family room, because Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend, Mom was unable to just leave them there for Roger to do when he got off of the phone. Instead, instead of coming out of the faucet

Fortunately, she felt that the drowned rat look might be acceptable. No one ever got blamed for doing it. However, the answer is clear. … Who shot Mom?

Some people like certain riddles more than others
My ideas for riddle ""types"" (examples on the site I link to):

1. [Reasoning Riddles](http://www.bigriddles.com/reasoning-riddles) involve the use of clever thinking.
1. [Logic Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/logic-riddles) often involve examining the situation and making judgements. ***EDIT: these types of riddles might belong in /r/puzzles.***
1. [Lateral Thinking Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/lateral-thinking-riddles) involve thinking outside the box and questions can be posed in yes/no form about the riddle.
1. [Language Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/language-riddles) are based in the use of language (i.e. what gets wetter as it driess?). Often rhyming.
1. [Spatial/Geometric Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/spatial-riddles) involve the arrangement of or rearrangement of shapes or patterns.

This is where hover-to-read comments come in. They eliminate the need for spoiler tags by spoiler tagging everything.

You are in prison with 19 other inmates. The warden decides to let you free if you can solve this riddle.

You and the other 19 inmates are placed in a room before the game begins. You are told the rules and you have as much time as is needed to collaborate before you are all brought back to solitary confinement.

Rules:
- Every hour one random inmate will be brought into a room with 2 light switches in it.
- The inmate must change one and only one of the switches before he leaves the room.
- The game ends when any inmate can say with 100% certainty that every single inmate has flipped a switch.

Some clarifications:
There is absolutely no communication between the inmates or any other party after the initial planning.
When a random inmate is chosen it is truly a random selection
The light switches go up and down and that's it
The game ends when an inmate comes forward and if positive that everyone has flipped a switch at least once. He does not guess

It's been found. I'm pissed about it. They needed two cops to move a brick to get it out

[Here are some people's comments on the ""Medallion found"" post.](http://puu.sh/3rYHm.png)


Clue #1: It's time to get this thing going in full swing. But a bag of clubs do not bring. There's no par for this course

Clue #2: You may think it takes *hart* to solve these clues

Clue #3: &lt;cityname&gt; is great at helping her sister out

Clue #4: I'm not on the edge of insanity. I'm not trying to shake you to your core. I just can't give you no *moor*.

Clue #5: My hiding spot has trees and a bench or two. There are no castles in my view. So to be just and fair

CLUE #6: My pleas cannot be heard above the ringing of bells.
Where the medallion is at

Clue #7: I'm here to state my case and send you in an about face. So I'm taking away the Keyes just to put your mind at ease.

Clue #8: To win this prize

Clue #9: The jury's back and the judge is in place. A glimmer of gold just might save my case. I won't make the Jamboree

Clue #10: The verdict is in..... My backs against the wall. It's holding me steady maybe I won't fall. Don't lose track or I just might

Clue #11: If you can't stand it anymore

They'll put out another clue tomorrow morning

Also, but it can be hidden in any public place.

There aren't any golf courses in the city. 

Okay, in case you don't read that. It's Columbia Heights, MN.

Thanks!

A bit of an update: I'm fairly sure I know where it is

Update 2: Nope

Yet another update: At Prestemon Park

Update 4: Maybe it's at Ramsdell? Curtis Ramsdell was shot with a .25. It also has a picture of his *face* there.. I've heard it's hidden at Huset often, which could also explain 25. It could also be at Wargo *court*, I checked there quite a bit though.

Update 5: They sneakily eliminated Kordiak, not Heights. So the ""Within Heights care"" is probably about that.

Update 6: Maybe a lot of these are red herrings? It says in clue 6 ""Where the *medallion* is at, a lot of the rest talk about where the *person* is..

Investigators could tell me that Mrs. Hansen always tend to have the door to her bedroom locked when she is there.

What has happened is that the killer has stabbed Mrs. Hansen in the chest as soon as she opened the door

However
Then she tried to crawl towards the end of the room where she has bed and a desk standing side by side.

Probably to try to give a message about who killed her.


But she has failed to come up to the desk where she has pen and paper lying and instead collapsed and fell dead about halfway up in her bed with her right hand lying on a blue and yellow gift paper.
Police think the fact that

All witness statements indicate that there were only four people in addition to Mrs. Hansen in the house when the murder occurred

- It was the South American maid Ana Lucia who has worked for several years for Mrs. Hansen. She was the first who realized that something was wrong when Mrs. Hansen did not answer when she knocked on the door with lunch.

- Dr. Christer Green is Mrs. Hansen's personal physician and the rumors say that they had a relationship. The doctor said he was upstairs in the bedroom ten minutes after Ana Lucia too give Mrs. Hansen her daily medication. She did not open when he knocked on as he assumed that she was busy.

- Ivar Hansen is deceased Mr. Hansen's son and Mrs. his stepson. He watched TV in his room when Ana Lucia shouted at him. Together with Dr. Green

- Eivind Steina is a friend of Ivar and was visiting. He said he did not know Mrs. Hansen

You are trapped in a bookshop. The door to escape takes a four digit code. You find a five part anthology of Shakespeare's plays:

1. Romeo and Juliet
2. King Lear
3. Macbeth
4. Hamlet
5. Othello

And a note scribbled on the wall near the door has a poem:

-------------
&gt;In here is a tragedy---

&gt;art thou player or audience?

&gt;Be as it may

&gt;all go on only toward death.

-------------

&gt;The first word at thy left hand:

&gt;a false lunacy

&gt;Hearing unhearable words

&gt;to a beloved's grave---and there

&gt;mayhap

----------------


&gt; As did this one playing at death

&gt;find true death at last.

&gt;Killing a nameless lover

&gt;pierced a heart rent by sorrow.

--------------------

&gt;Doth lie invite truth?

&gt;Doth verity but wear the mask of falsehood?

&gt;Ah

----------------

&gt;Still amidst lies

&gt;not

&gt;Will thou attend thy beloved? Truths 

&gt;and lies

&gt;a game of turning white to black and 

&gt;black to white.

---------------

&gt;Is not a silence brimming with love more

&gt;precious than flattery?

&gt;A peaceful slumber preferred to a throne 

&gt;besmirched with blood?

-----------------------

&gt;One vengeful man spilled blood for two;

&gt;Two youths shed tears for three;

&gt;Three witches disappeared thusly;

&gt;And only the four keys remain. 

-------------------------

&gt;Ah but verily...

&gt;In here lies a tragedy.

&gt;Art thou player or audience?

&gt;there is something which cannot become 

&gt;a puppet of fate or an onlooker

I posted it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oshcd/hey_reddit_whats_your_favorite_riddle/) yesterday and nobody could come up with the answer.  I heard about /r/riddles and I thought that maybe you guys would be able to help me out.  Here's the ridddle:

*There was once a village of 50 very smart and very crazy scientists. Each day these mad scientists studied advanced calculus and biomedical research and plotted devious evils upon the world. Realizing that the scientists must be stopped, and any scientist who discovered the color of his own bomb would explode that day at midnight. Unknown to the scientists, the leader of the wise men placed 10 black bombs and 40 white bombs. Of course, the scientists thought they could outsmart this curse. They removed all mirrors and reflective objects from the village and vowed never to tell another scientist the color of his bomb – for they saw each other every day and each could see the color of everyone’s bomb except their own. Five years passed and the scientists believed they had outsmarted the wise men. There had been no explosions and life progressed as usual. Then came a turning point. The leader of the wise men returned to the village and called for all the scientists to gather around him. Thinking that he might remove the curse, each of the 50 mad scientists listened carefully to what the wise man had to say. And it was this: “I will tell no one the color of his own bomb, but I will tell you all this. There is at least one black bomb.” And then he left the village. Thinking nothing of the incident, the mad scientists continued their evil plots. Then, they exploded. Why?*

EDIT: I didn't know if I needed to include this when I originally posted this

*It seems paradoxical that the scientists blew up since they already knew there was at least one black bomb. After all, what does he indirectly tell them that they didn’t know before?*

The two big questions I have are

1. What does the wise man tell the scientists indirectly and 

2. Why does it take them a ""number of days"" to explode?  What did they figure out after the wise man talked to them that they didn't know the first day he talked to them (the first day being the day he told them there was at least one black bomb)?",,t5_2qiux,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/otaly/the_mad_scientists/

Mark's dad won't buy himself a new car. 10 years of sacrifice

**Why did Mark kill himself?**

**SOLUTION**

[Mark's dad has been saving up to buy a new car for over a decade. When he finally got enough to be able to buy the car

[He was looking for a game with low odds, Norway was leading the game 30:29. The odds for Norway victory or draw (X2) were about 1.1, making this a perfect bet for Mark, since it was close to impossible for Poland to score two goals in less than a minute.](/sp)

[Well, Polish goalkeeper Szmal saved what would otherwise have been the winning goal for Norway, the winger Gliński scored the equaliser. Norway needed a win to advance into the semifinals, so they subbed their goalie out and brought in a 7th court player. With less than 10 seconds to go Norway loses the ball and Poland pivot Artur Siódmiak throws it into the empty net from about 50 meters.](/sp)

[Poland wins the game 31:30

Now keep in mind that the only helpful tool you can use for the 4 people is your sports car,...) and houses, so no one can take it for a walk, especially in this kind of time &amp; weather.

What do you do in that kind of situation? How will you give your help &amp; prioritize it to those people? Which one will you choose to be the first person to be helped? You have to think very quickly to come up with a solution for this predicament.

C LOOPSEEND

What makes it odd for him is that he remembers seeing an exact duplicate of the sign back home when he was a child. 

He asks the employees of the store about the sign and learns that C. Loopseend isn't the name of the store's owner or any of the employees

Can you figure out what the sign means?
