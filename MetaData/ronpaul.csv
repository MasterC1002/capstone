**UPDATE 3** I am talking with the mods of the RonPaul IRC channel over at freenode. The guy is setting us up a chatroom on his server to use. I'll have more info on it when I get it. But we should have a secure room setup by Monday. Mark your calendars

**UPDATE 2** May 14 is the day! If it goes well

I'll message Zak again and ask him to put it on the sidebar as a reminder. In the meantime

**UPDATE** I emailed Zak and the other moderators. They are on board. We need to choose a date(s) to do this. Also

Also-- just for clarification: We'd be using the official ron paul phone from home system. This whole idea is just to get us together in one place at one time to help the campaign out. It would be cool to get an IRC chat full of 15

I'm proposing a tentative date of Next Monday the 14th

-----
Nobody outside of the Paul campaign thought we'd still have a shot at this point. So that right there is a victory. Be proud of yourselves for that.

However

The bad news? It's not looking good (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries

The good news? It all is coming down to these two contests. If we can get Paul a victory there

Redit is pretty awesome

Last night opened the race up again. But if Dr. Paul doesn't win a state,. calling Maine radio stations, buying billboards in Maine, talking to friends in maine, registering voters-- EVERYTHING. We can do this. Let's put every ounce of collective effort into getting him this state. Then we can ride that momentum. Please you guys! We can do this!

So the story starts a few months back. Louisiana just had their 2012 Republican Presidential Primary results in which Rick Santorum took 1st place, not 15. The other 41 state delegates will be chosen by the congressional delegates who will be voted on in the Louisiana Caucus. Not too long after, Louisiana held it's Caucus for the registered republicans to vote for congressional delegates who will go to the State GOP Convention and vote for the other other 41 state delegates. Louisiana has 6 Congressional Districts. Ron Paul won 4 of the 6 districts, Mitt Romney won 1 district, and both presidential candidates tied and had to split the congressional delegates in half in the 6th district. The media still remains silent through this huge victory for Ron Paul. Ron Paul will have 113 out of the 180 congressional delegates represent him and his (our) platform at the Louisiana GOP Convention. This means that Ron Paul essentially ""won"" Louisiana. Needless to say the establishment was not too happy about this outcome and they made plans of their own. I'm proud to say that I am one of those 118 elected congressional delegates.

This past weekend was the Louisiana GOP Convention in Shreveport, platforms, and vote for the remaining state delegates. The GOP set up a convention schedule months in advance. The committee meetings were scheduled to be on Saturday morning and the voting of state delegates in the afternoon. Two days prior to the Convention day, the GOP Head Chairman had decided to move the committee convention up to Friday morning so that the inconvenience for delegates of missing work and making lodging accommodations would result in the absence of the elected Ron Paul delegates. Their poor tactic didn't work and everyone made arrangements to be there. The Chairman decided to hand out a new rule book which would take effect immediately on the night before Saturday's convention. This was a clear violation of the LAGOP rules that state clearly that new rules would be approved by a majority. The Chairman's new rules were obviously to favor his authority and power and keep himself immune from a majority rule. This would also give him the authority to choose certain delegates instead of letting the majority (Ron Paul supporters) vote on these certain delegates. A majority of the rules committee obviously denied this arrogant request by the Chairman on Friday.

Saturday morning. The Committee Chairman passes out his new rule book as if nothing happened the day prior. When the congressional district leaders filed for a motion at the convention the Chairman didn't recognize the motion and purposely ignored all the motions as if the leaders were invisible. The crowd started getting restless from the blatant disrespect. A congressional district leader stands up and makes a motion to the audience to appoint a new GOP Committee Chairman. This is a legal action and is supported by the LAGOP rule book. When the majority voted and supported the favor of a new chairman the new chairman was then implemented. The old chairman lost control of the room and told the cops to arrest the person speaking to the convention who led the new vote. While the peaceful speaker was being arrested

The old chairman kept resuming the convention schedule despite the fact that he was legally voted out. All of us 118 delegates (majority of the room) then stood up and turned our chairs 180 degrees to put our backs to the former GOP speaker and his podium and we resumed the convention with a new Chairman and speaker appointed who was facing us from the opposite end of the room. The new chairman had a microphone and amplifier to match the volume of the former speakers mic. The former GOP chairman then had the speaker arrested because he didn't appreciate his obvious diminished power. The cops tackled the defenseless 60 something year old handicapped speaker and during the process broke his hip. He was taken out in a stroller and later arrested while he was getting X Rays in the ER. We then had a new speaker (a female) who led us through the process of voting on the rest of the 31 delegates who will represent the state of Louisiana in the Republican National Convention while the former GOP Chairman took votes with his minority delegates of who they believe will be the 31 people to represent Louisiana in Tampa.

After the convention the cops proceeded to bully ""The Ron Paul People"" to leave the convention and not to loiter despite the fact that we paid for the use of the convention center. I have left this experience disgusted with the Republican Party and disgusted with the police who ""protect and serve"" their community. We still live in a brutal Police state where politicians and cops are above the law and will resort to physical violence against their own peaceful citizens. The establishment has broken its own rules to keep itself from a peaceful revolution that legally played and won at its own game. They've hired the police to violently restrain its own citizens and elected chairman/delegates/etc... This is a modern case of a slavery plantation's tactics to keep its slaves in line. I hope that my good work will one day pave the path for a true Republican candidate that will arise in my lifetime whether that be in Gary Johnson or whomever. For the present, Mao Tse Tung, and all fascist government organizations that blinds its citizens facade of freedom under the blanket of nationalism.

When i watch the nomination of Mitt Romney all I will think of is the famous quote from Star Wars when Padame says ""So this is how liberty will die

Listen up, and we are going to give it to him. I don't care what he sounds like in interviews, I don't care why he doesn't outright attack Romney, but we're taking the nomination from Romney and we're beating Obama.


All of these dimwits on the GOP are going to be removed and we're taking back our party. The recent announcements by Benton and Paul himself ARE NOT FOR YOU. Paul is playing CHESS and not checkers like the rest of the GOP (a comment I read here).

Remember

Dr.Paul has relentlessly fought congress and all others for over 40 years, neighbors, cousins, family, church members, cult members, what ever. IT IS GO TIME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

The MSM and others think he's out, he will not drop out until the results of the RNC in Tampa.

Another great comment I read here is, the original idea behind everything! Liberty! 


We must not allow these corporations and their money to control OUR lives. It's time to wake up and take back our dollar, but if we do not correct it, WE WILL PAY FOR IT WITH ENSLAVEMENT. I am a free man, not a slave to anyone, it is time we pay off our debts and remember where our foundations come from.


What happened with the revolution that started America? They left their families and warm houses with food to fight for their rights. It is time we realize we cannot be warm and well fed with the issues at hand. Turn off your damnable television and start educating yourself and everyone around you about the issues and the consequence.


You and I both know that if Ron Paul does not win this nomination


Take every damn negative comment and article you've read on reddit and throw it out of your mind. We're winning this fucking nomination and you can't deny it. We have raised millions of dollars for liberty, our dollar WILL collapse and it will cause more consequences than anyone else can know. Your hard work in school / college and every day jobs will be worthless if we cannot keep our country alive and the USD real. 


People speak of Paul causing a movement

It is time for each and everyone of us to realize, call you insane and old. Dr.Paul is NONE of those. We should not give a damn about any of these name calling people, we know they're scared of anything that isn't ""OKAY'D"" by their mommies and daddies, and foremost their government to keep them safe.


Now Listen folks, don't stop, liberty does not sleep and we know tyranny is lurking in the shadow of our doorpost. 

Ron Paul has never dropped out

A vote for anyone but Ron Paul is a vote for murder. There is no reason for any war

* They just announced each counties delegates numbers vs actual delegates signed in. Now they are asking to meet with each of the County chairmen in private with their total county delegates

* Webster has asked Tweed to take up his position as chair...and so it begins.

By saying that Ron Paul is racist

All it would take is a well produced message giving Ron Paul the camera 3-5 minutes to talk about Race. It doesn't have to be on tv - the internet will spread it.  Clearly he cannot get this out in a way liberals will believe it on MSNBC or CNN or TPM (who disgustingly and dishonestly tweeted ""fear of a black planet"" as a ron paul song

I'm not a writer but I'd imagint it along the lines of something like this:

-------------------
I am here to apologize for my past affiliations. I have disavowed them numerous times but I  know that is not enough. 


I hope that at the very least you can hear me out as to why I believe a Libertarian belief is a panacea rather than a burden on the racial problems that plague this country. I believe that even admitting we have problems with race in this country is in itself more honest than my fellow candidates.


Because of the the ""war on drugs

(also talk about wars

I hope at the very least you will consider that unlike anyone else you've seen running I have said and believed the same thing for 30 years and I have a public record to reflect that. I ask you

And lastly I humbly ask America that the Libertarians and real Conservatives and Constitutionalists in America not be burdened with this criticism because of my past mistakes in choosing friends. This is a vibrant and concerned group of people who have sparked more political movement on the ground in the last 40 years during a time when the country needed it most. Whatever happens

I know full that defending oneself' against accusations of racism is an uphill battle in America

God Bless America &amp; Merry Christmas

( bring tiny tim out with the corpse of checkers the dog (which signifies the death of the neo-cons) but maybe we don't need the dead dog

-------------------
edit: i'm also a longtime reddit user (since 2007) with a comment karma in the hundreds if not higher posting anonymously. i have argued against libertarians in the past and am happy to share my account with anyone that wants to PM me. something like this would win me and surprise my liberal minority friends -- i know that much. 

edit2: thank you guys for the upvotes and for even reading my thoughts. i have been feeling uneasy and frankly helpless and without a voice in this crossfire of unreasonable accusations and i appreciate and am heartened by this civil a conversation with those with who i have genuinely disagreed with for so long. you guys are awesome. many of us look forward to the progressive vs. libertarian debate that America deserves. i'm signing off now to go program a bit for work but i wanted to thank you again -- i love not seeing a single comment below zero points.

I've said it before

Now, something like, ""make sure you donate some money at some point"". People forget that. They get busy. They put it off. It's too abstract, just like the approach I feel many people are probably taking toward this primary season.

We're fed up with the lack of coverage he's getting from the major networks. Why are we fed up? Why does it bother us? Not simply because we want to see ""our guy"" on television

We have a month to spread this message. All of us with March primaries need to make sure we're registered and check to see if our friends and family are registered. We can't wait. We have to have the uncomfortable conversations with our parents or grandparents who take their advice from Hannity and Limbaugh. We have to speak WITH them and not AT them the way the talking heads do. Use truth and reason to break through the shell that's been built up by media bias.

I'm 18 years old, and more than that I have divulged myself in the liberty movement, something I feel I wouldn't have done without Ron Paul leading the way.

Dr. Paul has spent more time fighting for us than I have even been alive

This past March, from that moment on my involvement in this movement became more aggressive than ever, and I had the motivation to continue spreading this message despite all of the opposition.

All of us are upset by the events of the past few days, to continue fighting for the message of liberty. We must be the ones to run for office, we have to be the ones to never let our efforts be undermined by the establishment, we must be the ones who stand up into the face of the machine and prevail. And we will.

The events of the past few days have made certain that my future is in the government. We simply can not leave it up to anybody else to fight for liberty

Please, it simply was not meant to be. When the time comes for us to take the reins, let us look back on the motivation we had, let us fight for liberty with the same level of enthusiasm that we had this year. This is only the beginning of a fight that we WILL win. This system has run its course, and we are going to be the ones that will be remembered for saving ourselves from oppression, we will be the ones to make a difference, make no mistake.

Thank you, thank you for dedicating your life to the cause of liberty. You will be the one that we all look back and remember as the one who allowed for us to take control, and stop this mess.

You're all here for a variety of reasons and whatever those reasons are, is the lack of care.  When you see something that is even slightly anti-Paul, our reaction shouldn't be to immediately try to discredit them, cry fraud or, worse still, level charges of corruption and cronyism.  

I am not naive enough to believe that those things don't exist and aren't in place in the American government

Ron Paul's message is one of American solidarity founded on the single greatest expression of human liberty and freedom the world has ever seen

And part of that document is the right to free speech.  The EPS guys are allowed to have their say. Romneyites

You can and SHOULD argue with reasoned logic against things you feel strongly about

It's in jeopardy of changing in favor of the establishment.,davidverner,338,74,8,"A lot of people have been holding the state of Alaska as a Ron Paul victory when the fact is it is not assured yet.  Our convention was not adjourned but forced to stop until another day [video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXhJ_ZEDXmQ&amp;feature=plcp) [video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np5h7A0dNCA&amp;feature=plcp#t=37m).  The hassles and shenanigans that happened in the credentials caused turmoil for those that had to wait until the day of the floor meeting to be seated making people become more disenfranchise.  The blatant attempts by the establishment to bulldoze through issues has also left many with a sour taste in their mouth [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCx97hHkiYU&amp;feature=plcp).  

With the SEC meeting that happened on the May 7th the information I have been given [image](http://imgur.com/hQGnu) makes it seem the establishment want to prevent the SCC meeting on June 9th to become the second meeting of the convention by preventing a quorum from happening (2/3 districts present

I have also heard some disturbing rumors about Paul delegate selected for national convention being blocked because there isn't enough money in their accounts for withdraw for the national convention hotel.  I haven't been able to confirm this on my own yet so I'm still classifying this as hearsay until I can get more evidence to confirm this.  

It is not known if we might need help from the greater Paul community but the people that are upset with how things are going in Alaska might ask for help before the second round happens.  I'm self employed and have set up a deal myself to offer a small portion of my income (if I make anything this month) to help people be able to attend this convention.  I'm also going to try and interview people in my local area about problems that the establishment has caused them trying to prevent them from being a delegate.  

This is a big task for me since I'm flying to Chicago next week to document the NATO summit and the protests around it.  I will post updates as more confirmed information comes forward and can I validate it.

I have also posted some videos from the floor meeting on this [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/OccupyFromTheNorth/featured).  More will be uploaded this weekend.

I wanted you to get an update from me personally

Due to the smart planning of our campaign and the hard work and diligence of supporters like you

What's more, believe in our ideas of liberty, constitutional government, and a common-sense foreign policy.

When it is all said and done

And while this total is not enough to win the nomination

I hope every one of you continues the fight we have advanced so well this year.  I hope you will finish your local and state conventions, that you will head to Tampa in August to force the Republican Party to listen to the voice of liberty.

We have never had this kind of opportunity.  There will be hundreds of your fellow supporters in Tampa who will be ready and willing to push the Republican Party back to its limited government

There are many issues to fight for in Tampa.  Also, and Thomas Massie need your support as we move into the fall.  Across the country, supporters of liberty have won local office and leadership positions in the GOP, and we need to keep working.

Our delegates’ presence must be felt both in Tampa and in years to come. 

Stand up for what we believe in.  Be respectful.  And let the establishment know that we are the future of the Party and of the country.

Our Revolution is just getting started.  You'll be hearing plenty from me as we approach Tampa and the fall elections.  You'll also be hearing of important developments on Audit the Fed and Campaign for Liberty.

I hope you'll continue to stand with me as we go forward.  Our Revolution could not have come this far without you.

For Liberty

Ron Paul

to destroy the unity we all have worked so hard to maintain. You guys fail to see
the political moves that are being made to give you people a legitimate voice in the
Republican Party. 

The only way Republican hard liners will allow Ron Paul supporters to have a role 
in the upcoming National Convention is if they don't view you guys as a threat to 
their interests.

They fucked us over in 2008 at the National Convention

Rand's endorsement is just one way in which this perceived threat can be mitigated.

The GOP is salivating over this Rand Paul endorsement because it's exactly what they 
wanted this whole time. 

And if that endorsement is what it takes to get our foot in the door at the convention then so be it. Stop crying foul

Are we so narrow minded to think we can change the direction of American politics by the end of 2012? This is a decades long war which will require political participation on all levels. And your negativity about what is going on only gives joy to our ""enemies""

So wake the hell up and realize that you people who are not privy to inside information have no idea what is really going on. 

Just because you are confused as to what's going on is no justification for all the negativity I am seeing here.

And some people here want to demand that the Ron Paul campaign explain themselves over this endorsement

His Texas GOP convention speech is more than enough proof to see the Ron is still fighting for all of us

If this speech is a sign of things to come

And to quote Paul from his Texas speech:

""These old Republicans are a thing of that past

* The formality of your caucus experience will depend on the size of your precinct.  My precinct is fairly large and will be fairly formal.  In smaller precincts it's not unheard of to gather in someones home and drop a slip of paper with your candidates name in to a hat.

* Speaking of smaller precincts... because of RP's excellent ground game most will have a delegate to speak on his behalf, they can be swayed.

* You can bring children.

* If you will be 18 by November of next year you can vote in the caucuses.

* If you are Independent or Democrat you can register Republican at the event and participate.

* I heard the RP campaign will have busses available for people who can't make the drive for whatever reason, feel free to PM me.

1327148551.0,oq5fg,"Has Ron Paul really took over the web? It is time we organize, work, and win this election.",simplequestions1,279,52

This is a list of problems stopping Ron  Paul from winning this election.
1. We all know that the media for whatever reasons do not want Ron Paul elected. They consistently ignore him and misrepresent his views. 

2. Many voters do not have the time or motivation to do the hours of research needed to really see what is going on in this election. They rely on what the media pounds into their head to make a decision. 

3. Ron Paul's ideas do not break down well into sound bites. It takes a bit of thinking and time to understand his positions and the overall philosophy. 

4. His continued spread across the internet is hindered by people instantly ignoring anything about Ron Paul because we as supporters have been marginalized and deemed crazy

Here is how I feel we need to run this campaign and I am calling for organization from everyone to make a difference. 

We need to very precisely make comments which can be posted in specific news articles, etc. across the web. These comments need to have the appearance of someone who is not biased and isn't pushing a candidate. Since people marginalize us we should work around that. We need to express views in such a way that can connect with people but doesn't sound like we are trying to campaign. 

As an example. 
In response to a news article about Romney
""Romney is the ceo that comes by your place of work once ever 6 months and leave a big list of things he didn't like while he was there. Then cuts your budget and calls for layoffs. No wonder his top campaign contributors are goldman  sachs

There is a little bit of education in there. A little bit of connection with people who has worked in those types of jobs. We need to do soft educating about how the fed works, many things that will put more support in Ron's corner. People need to understand these issues but will not straight listen to you. We have to be very clever and not in peoples face about it. 

On top of making these types of comments we need to speak more directly to closer friends and family. Ask them to have a serious conversation with you about this election and the importance of it. In these conversations we need to express the liberties that are being taken away from us. SOPA, patriot act. The very pressing nature of our national debt and tie it back to real life people. We seem to think that the government owes that money....but they dont' we the people owe that money. We need to get across how important these issues are. Have these sit down talks with closer friends and family and ask them to research and educate themselves. If they come to agree  about the dire situation in our nation then get them to pledge that they will educate others in the same manner you educated them. 

The match is easy to see. If a thousand of us educate and gain the support of 2  people and those people gain the support of  2 more. It goes as follows. 

1000=2000=4000=8000=16000=32000=64000=128000=256000=512000=1024000

We can get this message out but we have to work together.  Use your facebook as a launching pad for these issues. Use reddit to discuss the issues in depth and further educate ourselves and organize our push. Lets use this thread to do some basic discussion about how to move forward and make some logical decisions. On top of these soft educational hit pieces it is still obviously fine to blanket all news sites and articles with  youtube videos on Ron Paul. Anyone who watches these videos will at least see the real Ron Paul and not just what the media says.

But to the very mainstream voter we have to grab them without them having to invest a lot of time. We need sharp direct comments and attacks which sound natural and are well placed to grab peoples attention. 
Above all hold these placements to the rule of truth. Ron Paul would not support inaccurate campaign ads and neither should we.  I'm typing all of this on my netbook and sorry for any bad typos. I hope my basis makes it through the web and explains itself to you all. Now

My supposedly-liberal cohorts are really starting to piss me off with their Ron Paul hate. Look, no more policing the world.** It's really that simple for me. I wish I could say the same for my friends, but it seems protecting social programs for any and all cuts is more important to them.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm a liberal dammit, egalitarian programs, regulation, etc. are all very important to me. However, I just can't rationalize letting more and more people be murdered by my country in order to make sure social programs go untouched.

I don't know what the hell happened to the priorities of my fellow liberals. In the Bush years, amplifies the Bush policies while throwing in some progressive rhetoric, and we no longer seem to care? WTF!? It makes me ashamed to point that out, but it's the dirty truth. Apparently it's okay to drop cluster bombs on children, just as long as you talk about raising taxes on the rich.

Getting back to the Ron Paul hate... Liberals will rightly point out that Obama has been ineffective in many regards due to Republican opposition in congress and so forth. Now, could come in and be a dictator? We seem to think he'd magically have the power to abolish medicare, medicaid, social security, the EPA, the Department of Education, etc. We really don't seem to understand the checks and balances of our system, but he could dramatically alter our foreign policy for the better.

In closing, but at the very least he could put some serious pressure on Obama and bring national focus to our foreign policy.

We can debate about the value of a tool like Twitter later, please help out, because we need to make sure that everyone knows that Ron Paul is still in it. Whether you believe he can obtain the nomination or not, the value of having more and more people see his name, and possibly hear his message, could be astronomical.

Do everything you can to help! Spread the word to your friends on Twitter

I think many of you feel the same way.  If the GOP shuts Paul out they will lose my/our votes and will have a hard time beating Obama.  The GOP needs to understand this: damaging Paul's campaign and shutting him out of the primary may also shut down the only chance they have at beating Obama.  The old school GOP has grown used to choosing one of two candidates who stand a chance to win the general election; they've got to understand that their choice no longer reflects the bulk of American beliefs and trust.  They need us.

We need a petition: Give us Paul or we will vote for him anyway.
