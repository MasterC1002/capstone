1341232655.0,vx6k2,How to speak without confusing your mechanic,tehdon,129,13,27,"I've been lurking and occasionally posting for a bit now
  
**Identify your vehicle**  
The *minimum* information that you should relay to us is the year, engine size, relevant options.  You will have to use your best judgement on what options are relevant.  Remember, it's always better to provide too much vehicle information than not enough.  Options that are helpful to know are transmission type (auto, manual), 4x4 vs 2x4, any aftermarket tomfoolery, and any recent work that has been done.  Again
  
**Vehicle won't start**  
  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, but doesn't start""  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, you should say ""The vehicle cranks and starts, but won't run""  
* If the starter spins the engine
* If the starter does not spin the engine
  
**Noises**  
  
When your vehicle makes odd noises try to tell us as much as possible about not only the noise, and what options are turned on.  Try to classify the noise that it's making, rather than just saying ""it's making noise.""
  
* Squeaks and Squeals: Usually a shrill,"" ""my belt on the front of my engine squeaks when the A/C is on, but only when it's raining out.""  As always, more information is good.  
* Grinding nosies:  That noise you hear when metal is rubbing against metal.  I've heard it described a plethora of ways.  Once you've heard it you will be able to identify it everywhere.  Tell us when and where you hear it.  If it's coming from your brakes then STOP DRIVING THAT CAR until you find out where it's coming from.  
* Clunking and thumping:  Clunking noises in the suspension sound like someone tapping a part with a hammer.  Sometimes it sounds like they are tapping it gently
  
**Driveability**  
  
This is the part that I'm sure people will disagree with me on
* If the vehicle seems to be running fine
* If the vehicle is jerking, or the engine is bouncing around like a [cat in an automatic catwash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyi8ly5dRkU) then tell us when it happens.  Is it only when you're going up a steep hill?  At night with the headlights on?  In traffic?  In the rain?  All of this information helps us figure out whats up.  
* If the vehicle starts, for the love of FSM don't say it ""won't turn over.""  Tell us it starts, and then dies.  Then tell us how it dies.  Does it idle for a couple seconds then die?  Can you feather the accelerator and keep it running?  Does it die when you put it in gear?  Information is key.  
  
**The Check Engine Lamp**  
  
We need to know why this light is on, drive the vehicle until the light comes back on, and have them read again, and tell us all of the original codes and the codes that came back.  The codes will be in a very specific format, such are ""p0300 Random cylinder misfire"" or ""p0305 Cylinder 5 misfire"" or ""p0420 Catalytic converter efficiency below threshold.""  
  
**tl;dr**  
  
Just take it to a mechanic and tell us what he told you

* Check your lights. Brake lights, you get the idea.

Underhood:

*  With the engine cold take off your radiator cap and check the fluid level. If it's nasty in there go ahead and flush out your cooling system. Top off as necessary.

*  Check brake fluid level

* Use a flash light and inspect your drive belts for cracks. If it is cracked

* Look around for oil leaking near your valve cover(s). If you see leaks a valve cover gasket is an easy, 3600, 3800 look in the valey on both ends of the motor for coolant leaking. They leak all the time from the intake gaskets)

* Check your power steering reservoir. If the fluid is low

* Check trans fluid

* Pull off your PCV valve and shake it. it should rattle a little. If it doesn't make any noise

* Check your air filter and if you are feeling so inclined pull of the tubing to the throttlebody and peak into the intake. If it's nasty try some seafoam treatment to clean up the gunk.

* Inspect your battery terminals for corrosion. This is cleaned with a baking soda water mixture. Then rinse off with more water. There is a special paint that can be sprayed on the terminals to protect from future corrosion if that interests you.

* Using a flashlight look for any motor mounts on the upper part of the engine bay. Check for tearing and replace any that are torn through or almost torn through. as soon as one mount goes

Wheel area:

* Check balljoints and tierods. On most cars jack the front end of the car up using the frame or pinchweld of the car. Hold the tire at 3 and 9 o'clock. shake side to side. a loose tierod will be light feeling. If you start to really shake the wheel back and forth you are going to feel some play from the steering rack. Just a gentle side to side shake. A loose tierod will be obvious

* Truck/SUV ball joints are checked differently. (the way these are checked are more dependent on the suspension setup. A good rule of thumb is that if the spring is attached to the lower control arm check them with this method). Jack the front suspension up by putting the jack under the control arm. Then use a prybar and pry up on the bottom of the tire. If the wheel moves

* Pull off one of your front wheels and peak at your brake pads. IF they are less than 2/32nds of an inch thick, you need to replace them.

* Pull a rear wheel and repeat the brake inspection in the back. If you have drums

* On drums check the shoe thickness. under 1/32nd of an inch and you need to replace them (if there are rivets on the shoe

* Check the tread pattern on all your tires. If they are at the wear bars (little raised pieces inbetween the treads) you need tires. If you have jagged edges you are having a toe issue. If you have excessive wear on one edge you may also have a toe issue. If you have a cupping pattern on the inside edge of the tire you need shocks. 

* Look for oil leaking from your shocks. You don't want oil leaking from your shocks.

Undercar:

* Do all that safe stuff so you don't kill yourself in your driveway

* Look at all of your suspension bushings. The little rubber pieces that are in all of the suspension connections. If you find some rotted out or torn badly. They need replacement. (90's Civics

* Look for oil leaks

* Check your exhaust for leaks and rusted hangers.


Ok

Please note that I breezed over many things

1372474200.0,1hagqf,Mini Dealership crashed my car on a test drive. Help!,starboxed,46,9,29,"I took my 2003 Mini Cooper in to my local Mini Dealership on Wednesday.  My brake light censor was faulty (brakes were already replaced) and never went off
My service guy had told me that he would be in touch Thursday, because I knew it was going to be a pretty penny.  He told me that he was waiting on information about my strut mount’s pricing from the “parts department,” and that he would call me back. 

He called me back a few hours later and told me that he had bad news.  Apparently, I asked him how bad it was.  He would not tell me anything other than that it was minor, and said he would like to discuss it further in the morning when I pick up a rental car.  He told me that they would pay for the damages from the accident, but that I was still responsible for the original charges.

I am not an expert in cars whatsoever. In fact, even though I wasn’t driving? If someone was seriously injured, am I held responsible?

I am so upset. Any help would be hugely appreciated.

edit; grammar

ACTUAL EDIT 1: I just remembered that my adviser had said that the damage was to the FRONT of the car. I will also update and attach photos tomorrow when I see him at 9AM Pacific, so I'm just truly hoping it's nothing bad.

EDIT 2: So when we went in there, and he gave us the scoop, and I braced myself. Apparently, an ambulance came out of no where (I live in Vegas, so this does happen at busy intersections. Where the dealership is located, there are 6 lanes of traffic) and everyone had to slam on their brakes.  My car gently clipped the car in front of it, and he said that the person who the technician hit in my car didn't even feel it. My adviser showed me pictures that he had taken on his phone ([they had already taken off my bumper when I arrived](http://oi41.tinypic.com/evat7a.jpg)), the way it looked from the photos, because I would have felt horrible had someone been hurt in my car).

So, and repainting my car free of charge. They are also deducting 15% of the initial price of what I brought it in there for (strut mount, oil change, fluids), and giving me a free, 2-year warranty that covers EVERYTHING they fixed: prior and after the accident. They also said that this is not going to go on my record, my car didn't lose any value, I looked at the paperwork

Right now, especially when they seemed to really be concerned with my happiness and were apologetic. Or maybe that's just my naivete talking, but I do feel like they went above and beyond to prove why my dedication as a customer is valued. What are you thoughts, guys?

I've imagined all kinds of nasty scenarios, like the car flipping over or something. I'm sure they're all highly unlikely. And I'm smart enough to not just try it (aren't we all?) so, for those of you who know transmissions inside and out... What happens?

My most optimistic guess is that the transmission goes to neutral and waits for the car to decelerate to a certain point before actually shifting (and thus giving the driver a chance to correct the error)

A few days ago my parents heard a clanging noise coming from the front tires when they started the car in the morning. Since it was also time for the front brakes to be replaced

None of us are mechanics and we don't know much about cars so even deciphering the invoice is difficult. If anyone could offer any advice on what the parts listed on the invoice are and why we would need them

Another thing is we're really confused why we are paying so much in 'labor'. Out of the $1500 we paid

Obviously $1500 is a lot of money and definitely not something we would be okay throwing away. With that said, I'd like to know if they were justified in charging us so much.  The car was in pretty good condition and we've never had major problems with it in all the years we've had it (we bought it new), we take very good care of it so this came as a shock. 

In the end, didn't work on it other than finding all sorts of problems with it, and then proceeded to charge us what seemed to be an entire day's pay for the entire crew.

Now my girlfriend and her sister know nothing about cars, but he's arrogant. We've butted heads more then once when he said something that's made now since. For example when her power steering acted up once last year, he said she needed a new power steering pump (without looking at the car), I simply said her car doesn't have a power steering pump because it uses electric power steering. According to him I didn't know what I was talking about because ""all cars use power steering pumps"".

Anyway coming to the most recent issues. About 4 months ago my girlfriend brought her car to have it inspected. Well it was there she asked if they could tell her what was causing a small clunk when when she went over bumps and give her a quote if it was serious. They told there was a little play in the sway bar links causing it

I don't know where to start with this fiasco. He came in after working on the car for like 6 hours, and then two weeks went by with her car out of commission. Finally I said screw this and despite hating working on cars I replaced the radiator. I was expecting there to be a whole from something going through it or a crack from it dropping on something but instead I find this http://i.imgur.com/f7mQ7kS.jpg?1 . Is it just me or does it look like he jacked the freaking car up from the radiator?

This brings me to now, he didn't give much detail on that. Lastly he claims the breaks AND rotors are shot. The breaks and rotors really get me, because for starters I'm fairly certain I would have noticed if the breaks were so bad the rotors were being affected. Also I know the breaks get checked during NYS inspection and I find it odd that they went from ok, to worn to the point of destroying the rotors in 4 months.

Am I fucked?,LOLumad1013,22,2,16,"I dont need a lecture on how much of an idiot I am. (I had been arguing with my fiancee about possibly ending our relationship and without paying attention put the wrong fuel in my tank)

1. 6.33 litres(1.5 gallons) of ""super"" unleaded fuel was put into my empty tank(This is what it is called at the pump in Germany where I am right now visiting my fiancee).

2. 35.74 litres(9.44 gallons) of ""diesel"" fuel was added immediately before I even started my vehicle. 

3. After filling the tank to full the rest of the way with diesel I let the car sit for about 2 minutes then turned the vehicle on and drove about 1.5 miles home without allowing my rpm's to rise past 1500.(I took it very easy on the way home)

I then parked the car and am writing this.

My question is should I or should I not drive this vehicle now? As it stands the tank has about 17% super unleaded fuel and the rest Diesel(including what was left in the reserve which I was using when driving to the gas station). I noticed no issue on the way back home but I also do not think the vehicle had driven far enough to have any new fuel pushed through the engine.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the advice. I wish I would have seen it earlier but I had to drive about 35 km away so a 70 km round trip. I tried to keep the rpms below 1500 but at times they got up to 2000. I did not go faster than 100 km/h(60 mph?) and am safely home. To be honest, or in how it accelerated and ran.

I can't see any evidence the frame is damaged.  The hatch is destroyed, but works fine.

I've gotten a number of opinions.  Mostly it boils down to my wife (and her father, and my mechanic/cousin) think it can be fixed.  If I buy the scrap for $1125, and pay $2000 for repairs, I could probably drive it for a few more years.  I'd save the $2000 left over toward the maintenance/replacement fund.

Some backstory: 

I've been using the same mechanic for about 10 years, and he did the work without discussing it with me at all first. When I asked him about why he responded that he thought I had just wanted him to fix it.


I was annoyed, my car had just overheated the previous day. To top it off, the driver's seat was rocking a bit and I needed a new inspection.


Still annoyed that he had done the work last time without clearing it


He told me he would get back to me later that day, he told me that the car was just about ready for pickup. I figured that it must have been something easy that he had quickly repaired, but it turned out that he had done $750 worth of work (and the inspection). He still had the seat to fix, but was working on it and I could come by in an hour.


I went in to discuss this with him. Again, but made it clear that I was very upset. He responded by apologizing and telling me about how sick his wife has been and how much time he has been spending with her. THat then dominated the conversation.


I started the car and the check engine light went on and the seat was still rocking. I needed to take the car


I picked up the car the next day. The seat had been fixed


Either that night of the next (I'm not sure when the next time I drove at night was) I noticed that while the check-engine light was off, but I assumed it was just the spilled coolant he had mentioned. I couldn't bring the car right back, as I needed it over the next few days.

Over the next week or so, he said that the metal that feeds the fuel had rusted out and that I needed to replace it, at a cost of about $400. 

I asked to see the problem

I have a 2002 Honda Civic.  I think my mechanic is yanking me around.  I don't know what to do.  He has great reviews but in the past 3 months

I live in Virginia.  My car started shaking on startup and jerking back and forth (not side to side) while pressing the gas about 2 months ago.  I brought it in to the shop, so I scheduled an appointment.  The day before my my appointment, my radiator cracked, so I got that replaced too.  They said an induction service would fix the spark plug issue.

A month and 3 days later, or at least by the second time I was in the shop.

Less than 12 hours after the ""repair, and I had to use my hazards and drive under 40 (over 40 and the shaking got worse).  At one point, I pulled over to let the engine cool off a bit.  I popped the hood and smelled burning coolant.  So that means not only did they not get the coil problem fixed, but it seems like they didn't get the radiator fixed properly either.

This is a Midas, and so I had no reason to believe they would jerk me around like this.  I don't know what to do.  I've poured every ounce of my savings into fixing this car, and they've essentially made it worse.  What can I do?  Do I have any legal recourse?  I'd like to ask them to pay for it to be repaired elsewhere because I don't trust them to do it anymore.  Or can I get a refund or something?  I'm so lost.

The story: Recently I noticed the car was just having awful mileage (for instance a trip from chicago to iowa city used up nearly an entire tank of gas, and so we decided to take a look. He was horrified to find the air filter apparatus was not properly sealed over the air filter, and the air filter itself appeared brand new. I'm sorry I don't have any pictures, but it looked completely unused, suggesting it was not filtering at all. We have no idea how it came to be like that, but I can assume that it must be very bad for my engine, since I frequently drive on unpaved roads in iowa, and it was almost completely empty. Coolant was low as well

First thing this morning I took the car to the nearest Mazda dealership and gave them the same play-by-play as above asking them to: Examine the air filter apparatus, explained my warranty, and assuming the car would be there all day I got a rental and left. 

Then just an 1.5 hours later I got a call saying they performed the compression test and everything is fine and the car is ready to be picked up. My gf's dad thinks they are bs'ing us. Basically:

-We have the warranty they may be trying to avoid. He does not think they took the time to properly look at the engine and assess if there was any damage. Instead, screwing us over.

And so he believes we should cut our losses and trade the car in

Given the situation

It is also relevant I was supposed to drive that car to chicago today

1361039847.0,18ncec,Airbag light on after servicing. Foul play?,prius_jess,15,4,12,"I need some help understanding what happened to my car at servicing at a toyota dealership. I don't know much about cars

I dropped my car off two Thursdays ago for servicing. I planned to leave the car with them overnight because I needed the 150, an oil change, and a new battery. The technicians performed a safety check as per the 150,000 mi servicing and reported nothing wrong with the airbag system.

I picked my car up at the end of the following day. When I started up my car, while driving, I noticed that the lights in my steering wheel were not on and none of the buttons worked (cruise control, volume, temperature, ect.). I called the Toyota dealership that afternoon and left a message. They called me back on Tuesday and scheduled me to come in on Thursday. 

The dealership called me later that day to tell me that the electronic component to my spiral cable had shorted out and that it was just an unlucky ""coincidence"" that it happened right after servicing the vehicle. There are a few confusions that I have regarding this statement: 

1) the technician who drove my car around stated that he did not see my airbag light on (and would not have let me leave the lot with this safety issue)

2) The technicians and manager are stating that the work on my car was not done near my steering wheel, who was not happy with me for insinuating that he was lying. He essentially told me I could have the work done there or come and remove my (unsafe) car from the lot.

I bought it knowing about a couple of minor issues and have pretty much taken care of most of them. However I have 2-3 residual issues that I am having trouble diagnosing/repairing.

The first has to do with the brakes. I recently had the shop I normally do business with look at the brakes and do an inspection. When we purchased it the emergency brake seemed to be inoperative. The shop inspected the brakes, then adjusted the e-brake to specs, but the e-brake will not hold the van when in reverse or drive. They said they tried to adjust to a tighter tolerance, but the brakes started to smoke when driven. Supposedly the mechanic asked around and this issue is common for the older E350 SD due to the weight of the vehicle. I'm just having a hard time believing that the NHTSA would pass a van for sale in the US with an e-brake that didn't work.

Then second issue has to do with a rubbing sound that occurs in hard right hand turns. The issue existed when we first looked at the van, though it is pretty close to the tire.

Lastly, Ford F250 (6.9)) I would normally say that it probably needs glow plugs. However, I'm not experienced with the 7.3 Fords. Are there other things I should check before I drop $80-90 on new ones?

So a little while back I had to take my car (A 2001 Ford Taurus) into a Midas shop for something, and maybe one or two other things.  Two days after I left, something else went wrong and my engine light came back on... I didn't blame Midas at all, I think it was unrelated.  So I took it back, they fixed whatever it was, and so I left. Upon leaving the parking lot, it came back on.  Getting irritated at this point, figuring shit happens; however, until..

Today I went to get an oil change at an instant oil change place (not midas).  After sitting there for ~45 minutes, whoever did your last oil change over-tightened it. We'll have to issue a refund and then we recommend going to the last place that you got an oil change at.""  So, off to Midas I went.

I got there, just give him a couple minutes.

Well, and they tell me they cannot get it off right now.  They want me to come back monday so they can weld a nut to the drain plug and use that to loosen it. They tell me that the entire oil pan/container/whatever may need to be replaced as well.  The manager says ""I know my guys here, and &lt;mechanic's name&gt;'s the one that worked on your car. I know him and he would NEVER tighten a drain plug that much,"" among other things blaming &lt;instant oil change place&gt; for everything.

So basically

I'm just curious, as Midas seems to be the worst thing to happen to my car.  I'd like to get all this fixed, but if the cost ends up being on me I'm going to be very annoyed, as I don't do a goddamn thing to my own car, since I don't know enough to feel comfortable around it.",,False,t5_2tkvu,True

The car is regularly washed and at least once a year (typically just after spring begins so as to get the winter salt out of the carpet), and sometimes also in mid-autumn) I have the interior completely cleaned and detailed. I've got WeatherTech custom molded mats in the car (which are awesome, btw). Any failed parts get repaired or replaced immediately.

Long story:
In the past couple weeks, rolling down the windows would make the radio shut off momentarily, and every time I tried to turn on my car, my radio would be wrong by a different amount. About a 3 weeks ago, it wouldn't start, not a click, for 5-6 tries. 

Last night, and we tried one of those charge boxes, neither worked. 

My dad says the battery is only a couple years old

Is there any advice or help you can offer? I'm a poor college student who's trying to avoid emergency services if that's possible.

- Replaced clutch (the whole ball of wax, master and slave, throwout bearing, etc.)
- Replaced alternator and battery
- Replaced various suspension/steering components, tie rod ends, and new shocks all around, complete with an alignment and fresh tires
- Replaced catalytic converter
- Replaced exhaust front pipe
- Replaced front wheel bearings and seals
- Replaced rear axles
- Replaced fuel filter a year ago
- Replaced plugs 12 months ago and 18 months before that
- Did a thorough flush and replaced dexcool with regular antifreeze about 18 months ago.
- Did the brakes and rotors about 30

Work that still needs to be done before safety and emissions inspections in November:

- New muffler (current one - the original - has a small hole or tear and makes a somewhat loud noise. Will probably not pass inspection) and possibly tailpipe

Work that I've been putting off for a few years:

- A/C is blowing hot air

Though I've had it for 13 years, money - into the vehicle over the last few years. As I'm guessing many of us have encountered, you fix one thing and two more pop up, leading into a rabbit hole where you're constantly referencing hindsight and deciding you wouldn't get rid of the vehicle because you've put so much into it now.

Anyway, hot (lack of a/c), and like any vehicle with that many miles, has its quirks. 

So here's my question: what would you do with this vehicle? Selling it 30, what would you do? Get rid of it immediately? Hang onto it as a second vehicle for weekend warrior-type activities? Or keep it as a daily driver until it falls apart? 

FWIW, using Valvoline MaxLife 5W30 during cooler months and 10W30 during warmer months. Also, per the suggestion of the mechanic I use, I'm adding about 1/3 to 1/2 a can of Sea Foam to the crank case with each oil change. I have noticed that I'm burning less oil since doing this.

After pulling the fuel rail, same as the others). I decided to replace all the O-rings on the injectors I pulled, and swap injectors #4 and #6. This way, if the CEL comes back with a cylinder 4 misfire, I'll know to replace the injector.  
  
Yesterday I put the whole thing back together. I turned the key to ""on"" (not ""ignition"") 3 or 4 times to prime the fuel pump. After one failed attempt, but still with a bit of a rough idle.  
  
Today, and then nothing happens. I charged the battery and even tried with it hooked up to a 75A charger/power source, no change. This is the same behavior I had in my one failed attempt above.  
  
One thing I was worried about was the ""union bolt"", but obviously I can't see this part when it's tightened. I didn't disassemble the fuel pressure regulator; the only other bolts I removed were the two circled in blue, which gave me enough room to lift the rail off the injectors.

About 4 weeks ago on a long road trip I noticed that occasionally at speeds above 100 KM/hr my steering wheel would start shaking like as if I had a tire that was out of balance. At the same time I also noticed that I was experiencing brake judder when touching the brakes at high speed. I should mention that only the wheel shakes

Here's the kicker: both of these symptoms will randomly disappear and reappear **together**. Sometimes the shaking will be pretty intense

Things I've ruled out:

* Warped rotors: I checked the lateral run-out on the front disks
* Unbalanced tires: The problem persisted when I swapped the front tires with the rears. Just to be extra sure it wasn't the new tires
* Crappy roads: On the same stretch of road
* (maybe) Wheel bearings: I ruled it out because don't hear any grinding/roaring noises.
* Loose lug nuts/axle nuts/suspension hardware: Everything's torqued to the recommended values in from the service manual.

Here are all the things I replaced in the last few months:

* Brakes: calipers
* Front control arms
* Inner and outer tie rod ends
* Rear struts
* Tires: 4 new Hankook brand

The front struts were changed but I have no idea when

I should also mention that about a year ago I replaced the right front steering knuckle/bearing/hub with a used part from a junk yard because the wheel bearing went bad. I don't have access to a press so it was easier just to buy the whole unit and slap it on.

The car was aligned right after I replaced the control arms and tie rods

My current theory is the front strut mounts

I'd like to buy another one in the lower 48 and drive it up to Alaska and am wondering if there is somewhere that is good to buy a used vehicle outside of Utah's classifieds.  By this I mean that I know some areas of the country are cheaper than others because trucks and 4x4 vehicles are less desirable than other places.  I'd kind of worried about buying a vehicle that I haven't been able to look at before hand but if there is something you guys recommend I'd love to do some research.  I'm not opposed to driving a little distance in order to get a vehicle that hasn't been beaten down by the elements (vehicles in Alaska take a beating in the winter).  I'm looking for an 01-04 Tacoma 4dr that is 4wd.  Any suggestions on where to look or another subreddit to ask?,t5_2tkvu,True

1370529366.0,1fsiun,1992 Buick Century - a variety of weird issues,SexySmiles,8,1,15,"Hi mechanics!

I'm a mechanically incompetent gal who needs some advice about her car.  I bought my 1992 Buick Century nearly five years ago, muffler, tires).  Over this past winter, my car wouldn't start.  I had it towed by AAA and had the alternator replaced.  All seemed fine and dandy, until about a week later, when it wouldn't start again.  I had it towed (AGAIN) by AAA, and had the battery replaced.

Since then, and guess what!? My car wouldn't start!  I tried again on a less rainy, less cold day, and it started.  From what I've deduced, it seems like this could be spark plugs? Or maybe moisture under the distributor cap?  My dad suggested that I get a fuel additive and some fresh gas (I live in Chicago, and I drive very little), so I did

Over the past 24 hours, but I think there may be some sort of electrical something or other with the steering column (since what happened this morning was even more weird and related to the steering column).

This morning (mild temperature, started it, all seemed fine.  I parallel park on my street.  My spot was kind of tight, so I put the car in reverse and turned the wheel sharply to the left (I parked on the left side of a one-way street) so I could start working my way out.  However, as I was turning the wheel, my engine died, and my ""service engine soon"" light turned on (for the first time since I've had the car!).  The weirdest part was that my key was stuck in the ignition? It would not turn all the way back to the position where I could remove it.  I moved the wheel back and forth to see if there was a ""sweet spot"" or something where the key would turn.  No dice.  I'm getting really annoyed.  

I then decided to put the car in neutral, I tried to see if my car would turn on again, it did, and it all seemed normal again.  However, I decided not to take it to work, since I have an appointment after work in the suburbs. I don't want to get stuck with no way home, so I'm going to have someone give me a ride.  I also didn't want to mess with it anymore since I was going to be late to work.

Sorry for the essay.  This car stuff has been really annoying.  I've already spent way more money on my car recently that I would have liked, but I'm not sure if I trust my car on a 200 mile trip right now.

Anybody have some suggestions for what I should do? Thank you!

But, close to dying. Idle in park was fine, so I figured no big deal I will adjust it a little. I noticed that when I turned the car on, the check engine light would come on when the sensors from the air filter were unplugged. Re-plugging the sensors and undoing the neg battery terminal cleared the light.

Well, as the car thinks you are accelerating and won't let you shift from park. I then gave a tiny turn to the idle adjustment screw. I also sprayed carb cleaner into the throttle and into the IACV opening. 

Now, this sounds like it almost misfiring or something, like chugging or pulsing. Also, there is a bit of white smoke now coming from the exhaust. Lastly, the check engine light is on and will not clear. Obviously it is something I have done in the throttle body but I am at a loss. I haven't checked the code to see what it is, but I thought I'd try here first to see if anyone could point me in the right direction.

I'm more worried about the little bit of smoke and water coming from the tailpipe. I just finished the head gasket and I'm worried that I did something crazy and it is already having problems again.

About 2 weeks ago just as I was leaving for work I turned on my car and it immediately died. The day is likely significant because it had dropped to below freezing from 50-60 degrees and had rained/sleeted. In the past I had some stuttering problems after it had rained but never this bad. Next morning the car worked fine and since than I've made sure to let it warm up for a good 10-15 minuets before driving any where. 

Couple days later while driving on the highway the accelerator gave out

1358829281.0,171ccs,2010 Chevy Cobalt: unresponsive to fob and key,33165564,10,0,6,"My 2010 Cobalt has started doing this lately. It first happened right after Thanksgiving and has now happened twice since (three times total).

End of November I came outside after work one night and did what I do every night. I pressed lock on my fob (lights flashed) and held down the start button on the fob for the factory remote start. Nothing happened. I thought maybe I was out of range, nothing. Put the key in, nothing. Key was stuck. Played with it for over an hour until some combination of the key turning and the headlights being turned on manually worked. Drove to dealership and they said they can't diagnose it if it's not broken, and it would cost me $130. I left.

Flash forward to last Tuesday the 15th. I started the car, no issues. Drove &lt;5 minutes to Target to get some cold medicine. As I was walking out of the store I pressed lock, and held remote start for 3 seconds. I did not have line of sight when I did it, but I was only about 100ft away so it should have started. When I could see the car, it was not started. Same story as before, fob didn't work, key stuck, tired many times. Called GM roadside to get a tow to the dealership since it was in the broken state and they could then fix it

Tow truck showed up (1.5 hours later than the 1.5 hour estimate I was given), since key was stuck and trunk release didn't work) and I tried starting it. Nothing. Flicked the headlights on manually, and it started. Disconnected, shut if off, started fine, no issues. Drove it to the dealership (same one as last time) and they said the same thing, not broke, but charged me ~$65 for an electrical diagnosis that found no issues..

Today I was going to leave work and tried starting it from my office since it was so cold outside (-10F). I had line of sight through a window from about 100yds away but could see it flash lights when it was locking, nothing. Got to the car, noticed all the same symptoms described above (no dome light, no alarm, etc). I didn't put the key in because I didn't want it to get stuck. Called my dad, he came to try jumping it, since that seemed to work last time. Didn't. Hooked up to posts under hood and battery in the trunk. Nothing.

In frustration, and alarm stopped. It was slow to turn over, but it had been sitting for 10+ hours in -10F, but battery didn't seem low, just cold. Drove it home, and it's fine now.

I know this is a lot of info

I thought from the start it was an anti-theft issue

Swapped my keyfob battery with my dad's and my battery worked in his remote

I think I covered everything

2010 Chevy Cobalt LT Sedan

Thanks in advance...

**EDIT 1/26** So this happened to me again today. Drove quite a bit yesterday, and headed into the mall for a while. About 5pm we were walking back to the car and I had line of sight from about 150 feet away. I pressed lock, lights flashed. I held start and saw the taillights come on, heard the car turn over (remote starter activated) and the taillights went off. The car ""started"" but never actually ran. 

After this, no dash lights, nothing. Headlights worked manually, taillights did not. Hazard lights did not work. If I pressed the ""i"" button in my radio, I could see the clock, but radio would not come on. I could eject the CD from the radio, and place it back in

Called my dad, engaging headlights, hitting the dash, etc (all the stuff that worked before...), the doors unlocked and all dash lights came on. Car started fine. Shut if off, started again. Took jumpers off and left it running.

This is now leading me to believe that the car battery may be the issue. I feel like it might be borderline OK so it works some days and if it gets just a hair too low

When I brought it to the dealership, but supposedly in the normal range. This was the second time it happened and I had driven it to the dealership, but only about 5 miles between when it was ""dead"" and when he checked it. It was only connected to the two truck for about 2 minutes that day, so not really enough time to get a good charge, but possibly just enough to start, and then start charging itself.

So I guess my plan at this point is to let the car sit overnight, I'm game. Just don't want to get a new battery and have that not be the solution.

It felt as though my passenger side, and I was just dragging it.  After about half a block it began to roll properly.  Didn't feel any unusual pulling on the steering wheel and that end of the car ceased to pull awkwardly on the rest of the vehicle.

Sometimes when it gets cold I notice that my wheels don't spin as well as usual when I first get moving.  If I'm in neutral the car slows down noticeably without touching the brake.

1346349350.0,z36nl,Spark Plug Questions,experimentalist,10,2,34,"Hello

Couple of quick questions... 

1)  I just put new plugs in my truck as part of my troubleshooting its ignition
issues, it ran extremely rich, until I properly tuned the carb.  This fouled up my plugs..they were jet black and grimy, and that caused me further issues.  Now, what I've read is that once they go black, they are garbage and should be replaced.  I don't want to have to replace my plugs every time this happens as I'd be going through them pretty quick while I learn how this all works.  I did clean them with carb cleaner and a #0000 steel wool, which seemed to return them to a reasonable state.  My friends say this is wrong of me and that I should replace the plugs no matter what.  I really dont want to do this....  I will replace the plugs one more time once I have the engine/carb tuned and whatnot, or was I right to clean and re-use them for the time being?

2) I bought the plugs as a set of six from orielly.. just cheap copper ones... I didnt
check the gap, and they were all gapped at 0.031 (or about) but my truck calls for 0.043 - 0.046  -- so I used the gap tool and corrected for what the truck called for.   I thought the plugs would be pregapped and set for my rig from the box... am I supposed to be gapping my own plugs every time or what? Did I do the right thing by changing the gap to what my truck wanted? It seemd like a big difference.. and.. the truck ran (seemingly) fine with both 0.031 and the 0.043 gaps.     

EDIT:

3)  One more thing... I notice that on SOME cylinders, they were whitish.. which from what I've read indicates those two cylinders were ran lean, and the black and grimy ones ran rich... how can this be??

Thanks for the advice...   :)

Sometimes It won't occur until after I'm already going 60 Mph I'll drop down to 58 and when I go to speed back up the car won't accelerate. Sometimes It will just slowly drop back down towards 45/50. It even occurs while using cruise control my speed will drop down to 59 from 61 and when it tries to compensate it won't speed back up for about ten seconds and then suddenly the car is going 67 and then it puts the breaks on and it goes back down to 61 where it's set.

I've been told it occurs to my father at around 75 mph as well.
My mechanic cannot duplicate this and cannot find any problems or codes showing up.

This seems pretty serious to me just to play a waiting game until it get's worse and hopefully something pops up on the computer.

The car doesn't always do this on every trip at higher speeds but I'm unaware of any similar conditions between times it does.

As well recently my Service Air Bag light has begun to appear and the passenger airbag light will go off when it's triggered on screen. It's usually only when I have a passenger but I believe it may have once gone off when i didn't have one. I'm thinking about taking it into the dealer because there is currently nothing my mechanic can do.

Also there's a  squeaking noise in the front right sometimes when I hit bumps or once in a while it will continue for a few minutes while driving. You can't Hear it with the radio on. Mechanic just oiled everything but has found no problems. 

Oh and my stereo/center console sometimes doesn't light up until thirty seconds after my car has been started.

I went ahead and took it to a mechanic, hoping to get the fluid replaced.(I'm a car novice, but after doing some reading this seems like a process I can handle) The mechanic said the fluid was fine (""good"", to quote), and said for me to save my money.

I just got a used truck

It looks like this: http://images.gtcarlot.com/pictures/27178371.jpg

The problem is, most of the ""repairs"" stick up above the surrounding paint.  They put the paint on too thick.

So

I figure I have 2 options:

1. Sand down the repairs (maybe wet sand) until everything is smooth and put down the right color (using a spray can of factory color paint) along with some clear coat on top.
2. Try and use some sort of cutting compound or scratch remover on the repairs.  This should take them down to even with the rest of the paint without doing as much damage to the surrounding area.  Then fill with paint and clear.  

Which option would be best or is there another option I haven't thought of?  I can't afford a re-spray and doing this myself should only be about $100.

1367791358.0,1dr5m8,2005 Honda Civic DX 1.7L Tensioner Pulley/Alternator Nightmare,lejonjames,7,1,5,"Hi

In the five years we have owned our vehicle

The vehicle was presented to an Air Force on-base Firestone for the standard milestone mileage inspection.

Results of inspection include recommended tune-ups of struts, spark plugs, and rotors. We follow through with the recommended repairs. We pick up the vehicle and pay.

A few days later, and as the car rolls into the parking lot, it succumbs to full-electrical failure, and coasts limply into a parking spot.

A Firestone mechanic takes a look. He notices visible slack of the ""alternator tensioner pulley"". (I don't know what this is). The Firestone documentation for this visit reads as follows: 

&gt;There is slack in the tensioner pulley. Part avail. through dealer. Cust came in for batt check and batt is not the problem. We rec seeing dealer.

Our vehicle is then towed from Firestone to the Honda Dealership. Honda dealership mechanics tell us

My limited understanding is that ""alternator adjuster"" and ""tensioner pulley"" are one in the same. Please feel free to correct me

My wife gives Honda permission to replace the part. They do. They call and tell us that the part didn't fix it; they put the car all back together but  it didn't work, they tell us that the fault is our own for not having a Honda-certified factory-direct-whatever alternator installed and settling for the aftermarket. I respect Honda's right to assert this. I may, however, disagree.

I decide to look back over the Firestone inspection checklist from before the car died. In every category, yellow for SUGGESTED, and red for REQUIRED, and in each check box, there are checks indicating inspection. I notice that the section for ""belt tensioner"" is unchecked; it is the only thing on the entire checklist without a marking. I bring the sheet to the Firestone to ask what this means but I get no answer. I bring the sheet to another Firestone, I'm told that it's ""weird."" None of this has helped me understand anything.

Firestone can't tell me if they inspected the ""belt tensioner"" in the first place. Honda is telling me the tensioner/adjuster was bad, Honda is telling me the alternator is also bad. 

**My questions:**

1. How are the tensioner/adjuster and the alternator interrelated. I was told by someone at Honda that these two things were NOT related.

2. If a tensioner/adjuster is too tight/too loose

3. Could the work on the brakes, etc. have brought a mechanic into accidental contact with the tensioner/adjuster assembly?

4. Is it not unheard of for an alternator with less than 10

5. Is replacing a tensioner/adjuster without checking the alternator on a car that has presented with electrical failure normal?

6. Is the ""belt tensioner"" portion of the Firestone inspection the same kind of tensioner I am replacing

One more thing I was told by the Honda service center: my tensioner was bad and I've been slowly damaging my alternator (even after they told me the two were unrelated) and there's no way of knowing how long it's been bad. Frustratingly

If I say tensioner/adjuster once more I might die.

I'm not trying to stir up any animosity or foment conspiracy

1361413585.0,18xf6s,Is this 1991 Toyota Camry DX worth keeping?,plopely,7,0,12,I recently picked up a '91 Camry for only $900. The interior and body are in good/very good condition. After having it about a week it overheated due to a leaking radiator hose (I think) which I failed to notice before and has some other problems probably as a result of that. My local mechanic says that it has blown head gasket which is most likely the root of my problems and that I should replace the timing belt while I'm at it since the car has about 173k original miles. He's quoting me about $1400. Now this is my first car and I'm not too auto-savvy so I really don't know if I've been ripped off already in buying the car and if this is a reasonable price for the repairs. Is the car worth keeping or should I try to turn it around before I sink more money into it? Of course I want to hear what will make me (and my wallet) happy but I want it to be given to me straight instead of dolling up what might be a big mistake. Thanks for your help guys.,t5_2tkvu,True

1359774687.0,17qgzh,2004 Ford Escape Idle issues (a bit elaborate),Btrash,7,0,9,"I have a 2004 Ford Escape XLT 3.0L V6. I have a bit of a multi-part question that actually may be more than one issue. Sorry if this is a bit long winded.

In [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/33OjS9f.jpg?1)

1. To begin, so I was checking for any flattening of hoses and noticed that the top circled piece, which seems to be a valve into the air intake, had popped out slightly.  I pushed it in fully and viola, I could idle.  Is this piece supposed to be just held in with friction? It seemed a bit gooey in there so I don't know if some adhesive or something is used.  

2. Today it was very cold ( -14F) and snowing with decent winds on the way home.  About 2-3 miles from home, so I didn't feel like I was pushing it).  After a minute, the engine seemed to feel like it was surging (can't think of any way to put it) a bit, so I let off the gas and it stopped.  Gave it gas again and it was fine for a minute again, then surged. (repeat 1 or 2 more times as I am pretty much to my exit now).  Now at the 2 stoplights to my house when idling, it is VERY rough and the engine is ""surging"". I made it home and decided to check the same valve, which was fine. When opening the hood to check this, IAC valve, but in removing the top cover, could this rubber piece be what smelled of burning and causing the problem I had tonight? As a note

Any help would be appreciated, but If you think it would be more worth my time to have it more thoroughly looked over by a professional  because of the such vague details that I am able to provide, please don't hesitate to let me know.

The genesis of this problem is, but I haven't had it out). I know I need to pull off the rail and I'll do new rings on all 4 injectors while I have it apart. How do I deal with the gas that's invariably going to come pouring out when I disconnect the rail from the fuel line? Everything i've read just says 'catch it in a pan' -- but that makes no sense.

Recently I've come across the problem of having very little heat through the heater core.
While the blower is not running, while the lower cool which I would expect. The thermostat has recently been changed along with the cooling system being burped properly, including the blower being on high/hot while burping the system to get rid of any possible air bubbles within the heater core.

I noticed while changing out the thermostat that the coolant temperature sensor was eroding because of the glycol mix of the antifreeze. It will be replaced. However, cruising at low RPM, or doing 65 MPH down the freeway.
The water pump works fine as I can visually see the coolant flow from the water neck on the radiator.

I would imagine that the radiator cap would cause a problem much like a clogged radiator; opening sooner rather than later by the pressure in the system. As I'm not sure when the radiator cap was last changed
The other problem that I would see is the coolant temperature sensor itself, rather the fans not turning on.
While squeezing all the hoses (upper and lower radiator, the coolant raises in height with the radiator cap off. This might lead me to believe that there might be a sleight blockage in the system not allowing the hot coolant to flow through the heater core effectively.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,

This one is perfectly rounded edges, save for the track where the boot locks in. As you can see I accidently pulled the boot off of it trying to pull it out. I don't know how to get it out! I've tried lots of different pry bars and places to pry off of, and nothing seems to give it that pop I need to get it out. anyone else ever come up with this problem? Currently I think I need to go grab a another pry bar that is a little bit smaller (looks like a flathead screwdriver except a lot bigger, with a bend at the end) and I might be able to get in there and be able to get it to pop, I dunno though.

Thank you r/Mechanicadvice for your previous help. I’ve been obsessing over this issue for the last 4 days and I have run into another unexpected turn. I was able to remove the starter. I took it in to a local auto parts’ store and it operated when the switch was jumped. Now

I am now back at square one since the starter is indeed in functioning condition (though this may be the original starter with 216k miles on it). I’ve read accounts of other peoples’ starters bench testing fine outside of the car but nonfunctional in the vehicle. How likely could this be for my own? Is it worth buying a new starter to swap and test?
I’m going to rerun my voltage drop tests to see if I can locate something I may have missed earlier. So far this is what I know:

1.	Checked all fuses. Nothing turns up.
2.	Tried started in neutral and checked for reverse lights when in reverse - no start
3.	Swapped Ignition Switch. Still hear the click in indoor driver side relays.
4.	Voltage tests (drop when key turned to III position)

o	Battery = 12.64 drops to 12.38

o	Engine ground check: Pos bat to engine block = 12.6 drops to 12.33

o	Starter ground: Positive bat to starter frame = 12.61 drops to 12.38

o	Starter power: Negative bat to solenoid power (wire/bolt) = 12.61 drops to 12.4

o	Starter activation switch: Neg bat to disconnected starter activation switch: 0 to 12.3. – should I test this on the solenoid itself or is the switch good enough?

I have jacked it up and had someone move the wheel around and I have determined that the sound is coming from the middle of the front axle but I couldn't visually see any damage or anything that would cause the noise. What do you think it would be and can I do this job myself without any outrageously priced special tools?

I have a clutch issue that has been nagging me for a while:

Engagement takes 2k RPM and a second of slip just to move in first gear. Problem is that at lower RPM it just stutters, causing loss of RPM and stall.  Stuttering can be felt throughout the car and is nearly violent at 1k RPM.

Car is a 2005 Subaru Legacy GT - otherwise is in great mechanical health. Clutch is ~1.5 years old with &lt;15k on it so far

Advice?

EDIT: I should clarify, launches are smooth but that's because I can let the clutch slip long enough to fully engage, but that makes for (really) bad practice and so you can't really drive the car in traffic.

To be clear, and doesn't slip unintentionally in any gear - the motor is also strong and doesn't lack for power at any time; the only reason a stall is nearly induced is due to the violent rattling caused by the clutch stutter if you try to engage first at low RPM.

The car will idle just fine (eventually check engine).  As soon as you open the throttle past idle it will hesitate, then die.

Before reading any codes we thought it was the fuel pressure.  The pump is running and the car will stay at idle no problem.

This is my first time visiting this subreddit. I hope I'm not in violation of any rules or etiquette. If so
  
---
  

I have an issue with the front passenger side wheel. I'm about to install the third set of wheel bearings
  
This is the first time I've done wheel bearings, and it goes about 90 miles a day. Without the car, I can't get to work, which means I can't support my family :(  
  
Here's what I've been doing:  

   1. Jack the car up on passenger side
   2. Remove the passenger wheel
   3. Remove spindle nut from CV axle
   4. Loosen and remove ball joint bolt that holds the ball joint onto the knuckle.
   5. Using a pry bar
   6. Now that the knuckle is separated from the ball joint
   7.  From the back
   8. Now the hub is removed
   9. The inner bearing is free
   10. Remove the bearing and seal from the hub assembly. I have done this two ways
  
Now this is where it differs. I don't have a press
  
The second time - which I just did on Tuesday - I used some sand paper to smooth out the cylinder that the outer bearing goes on. It's not highly damaged
  
In both cases
  
This morning on my way in to work

According to what I see online
  
I'm using Timken SET11 bearings
  
I had my tires rotated and two new ones put onto the rear yesterday. While the car was on the lift I noticed the new bearing (one day old at that time) was not right - I had play in my wheel. The mechanic tightened the spindle nut further and a lot of the play went away. The tire seemed to have a lot more resistance (is it possible to overtighten the spindle nut?) than before
  
This morning
  
What I'm suspecting:  
  

   1. I'm not pressing the bearings on correctly/fully. Maybe I need to remove the entire knuckle
   2. The minor wear on the inside of the wheel hub (that I smoothed out via sandpaper) is somehow causing it to fail. 
   3. I'm under/over torquing the spindle nut

  
Wheels aren't my thing - I can do brakes and CV's and basic stuff, due to family illness have missed a lot of work already, and something is causing this breakdown to occur.  
  
So, out of money now, and really hoping its not the hub itself. I can't find a new one ANYWHERE.  
  
Last, not seized or freely moving), and on the passenger side the castle nut on the outer tie rod end (I believe outer, the part the bolts to the knuckle) is stuck and wont completely tighten down. Oh, I just remembered another one. The part of my shift linkage that bolts to the side of the transmission (I think it's some kind of stabilizer bar or something) lost its bolt, so my shifting is funky - but that's not the issue just something I noticed when I took a look this morning after I got the car to my office).  
  
Now that I type all this out it really sounds bad
  
Thank you for taking the time to read this novel of a post

Next day, and someone recommends to unplug the battery, and reconnect it after 15 seconds or so to ""discharge"".  Well, I tried, and when I put the battery back in, it wouldn't start.  I took battery back out, waited an hour

So I do some more research and a lot of people are saying that the ABS + Trac lights are a bad Wheel speed sensor, I had the idea to post the totality of the problems and story here.

So I take it to Autozone to have the codes scanned.  The codes are (sorry for lengthy post

* C1261 ABS LF front inlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1262 ABS LF front outlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1266 ABS LF rear outlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1267 ABS right rear inlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1268 ABS right rear outlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1275 ABS Powertrain control module request ETS to be disabled
* P0748 Eng Pressure Control solenoid A Electrical

1373402988.0,1hykbt,[Need help/advice] Brake problem on way home from work today,faultlessjoint,7,0,5,"Car:  2006 Acura TL 6 speed manual

On my way home from work today as I approached a stoplight I pressed the brake pedal with the same force/depth as I always do given my speed and distance from stop line.  Nothing happened.  I had to depress the brake pedal much farther than normal before the brakes engaged.  I immediately pulled off the main road and began testing the brakes at slow speeds on side streets.  Here are my observations:

The longer (time) I go without engaging the breaks the further I must depress the pedal before they engage.  

If I constantly tap/pump the brakes then they engage at the normal pressure/depth.

At the exact same time as this problem occured a scratching/scraping/grinding noise began from one of my passenger side rotors.  I believe it was the front but as I was unable to confirm.  

I very cautiously drove the remaining 0.50 miles back to my apartment.  Upon parking I got out and did a visual inspection


So that's where I'm at.  My very limited knowledge of cars leads me to believe there was a sudden leak/drop in brake fluid pressure.  My questions are:

What should I do?  Is it safe to drive it to the shop (3 miles, stop-and-go traffic)?  Any advice at all would be much appreciated.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,

To replace the subframe you have to lift the motor up a few inches while you pull the motor mounts and install the new subframe. Looking at it

What I want to know is where to connect the chains when I lift the motor up. I have one of those engine stabalizer bars that sits on the shock towwers  and has two chains you connect to the motor that would hold the motor up.

In every other car I've pulled a motor from there have either been specific hooks or I wrap the chains around the intake/exhaust manifold runners or thread a manifold bolt through the chain link and back into the block which has always worked but that method isn't really an option with this motor as far as I can tell because the intake runners are plastic.

So anyway, my car seemed to work just fine and I drove home without a problem. When I left my car earlier in the day to go to class, it was daylight, so I was certain that I did not leave any lights on in my car. I thought about it and realized the only thing plugged in was the snapshot device, so I googled ""snapshot dead battery"". There are literally hundreds of people online with stories saying that this device has cause everything from dead batteries in their cars to a complete failure of their on board computer system. I immediately unplugged the device from my car and at that point I was still able to turn the car on after having my friend jump it the one time when I left class.  
  
In the morning, I drove to work and my car sat in the parking lot for five hours. When I went to leave work, my car again would not turn on at all even though I had a brand new battery installed only five hours prior. I again had to have someone jump my car, only this time it was car-to-car instead of by jump box. We attached the batteries to one another and without even turning the cars on I could hear something switching on in my engine. I then turned my car on and it started perfectly (while still connected to the other battery) without having ever turned on the other car.  
  
This morning my car turned on without any problems and I did not have to jump it. I have filed a claim with Progressive regarding this and the representative notified me that they have had many people calling in filing claims for problems they've experienced with their cars after installing snapshot. I am waiting to hear back from a claims adjuster and have scheduled a garage appointment to have a diagnostic run. My car is able to start just for a period of time after being jumped, but when turned on and off again that ceased. What do you guys think the problem is? Is it possible my new battery just needed to be driven around a bit more and now it's fine (as it started without any issue this morning after sitting for ~12 hours.) Or is it possible that some system in my car is now not turning off correctly causing some sort of parasitic drain? Any clue what this could cost me if Progressive refuses to cover the damage?

The torque procedure is two torques @ ft/lbs, and then two torques to an angle. I'm thinking since I didn't lube my washers, my ft/lbs torque came short, so after I torqued to angle, I'm a little short of how tight I should be. Is it a good bet that I did not get my head bolts tight enough? I'm thinking I can just tighten the bolts up a little more to get in the ballpark of the right tightness. I know the right thing to do is remove the head, get a new gasket and bolts and do the whole procedure over. Financial issues prevent me from doing so. What do you guys think?

Bought a new one put it in and connected all the wires. No problem so far. Turned her on and everything worked fine. Reved her up and blew out the lights.

At this point I have her running with all lights working except for the break light.

My headset is different and my switches are too.

I do not have an ignition switch like the  one in the above diagram. 

The cable that comes from the breakpedal (lightblue) which is connected with the light blue cable coming from the break light. If I connect those with the cable from the stator plate I get an output of over +100v. Disconnect them it stays at 6v. I have a rectifier and a regulator but I'm at the end of my electrical knowledge and it is bugging me knowing that my rear breaklight isn't working.

It's a '99 Old Cutlass 3.1M with 93, and checking transmission fluid level (sealed system).  I've never seen anything in the driveway other than A/C condensation.

I tapped the starter with a hammer while my girlfriend was turning the key.  Some smoke came out of the back of it and it eventually loosened up and started.

Should I go back and talk to them about it or is it normal for oil to slowly drip and build up on nearby components?  Is it even possible for them to get oil on it?  The filter is directly to the left of the starter.  What do you all recommend?

As the truck sits, I was unable to move it to 2nd gear or anything other than where it was.

My wife has a 2005 Dodge Stratus SXT, automatic with about 125k miles on it. She recently reported a CEL and that it was acting ""funny."" I took it for a drive first to see if it was acting up. It sure did. A little while after driving at highway speeds (55-60mph), with the cruise control on, all of a sudden the car started decelerating. I looked down and cruise had turned off. It wasn't just ""canceled"" it was all the way off. I depressed the gas pedal to get back up to speed, but as soon as the engine got up to about 2250rpm, the tach needle stopped suddenly and the engine rpm decreased all at once. Then it would creep back up to 2250rpm, hit a wall, put the car in neutral and revved the engine. Same thing; it revved up to 2250rpm then fell. I put it in park and got the same result. I turned the car completely off

I got home and ran the trouble codes from the CEL. They were as follows:  
&gt;[P2074](http://www.dtcsearch.com/P2074/) - Powertrain - Fuel and Air Metering and Auxiliary Emission Controls - ISO/SAE Controlled  
[P1697](http://www.dtcsearch.com/P1697/) - Powertrain - Manufacturer Controlled DTC - Manufacturer Controlled  
[P0340](http://www.dtcsearch.com/P0340/) - Powertrain - Ignition System or Misfire - ISO/SAE Controlled  

With all that, so I might just try that and see what happens. Does anyone know how to tell if for sure the MAP sensor is the culprit? Or any other thoughts on what it might be?

What has been replaced as part of recent maintenance:

- Upper/lower balljoints
- Wheels
- Tires
- Tierod ends
- Brake rotors
- Axles
- Distributor rotor/cap
- Sparkplugs/wires
- Front/rear motor mounts
- Air filter
- Fuel filter
- VSS
- Timing belt/water pump
- Radiator
- EGR cleaned (and gunk removed from fuel injectors during this)

Shuddering occurred before any of the stuff was replaced - a lot of this was necessary just because the car has 236

The problem is very symptomatic of torque converter shudder, and left-foot braking while shuddering (right foot to keep the gas pedal down, since shuddering only occurs with gas) does not stop the shuddering, but also does not appear to disengage the TCC.

I drove around with the TCC solenoid unplugged

I tested my TCC solenoid according to the factory manual - it says the specification resistance across the two solenoid connections should be between 12-24 ohms

I have a 2000 Saab 9-5 Aero 5-speed with 99K on it. I've been having shifting issues associated *I think* with the clutch hydraulics. In essence, all gears glide very easily and as they should. 

The problem gets worse as the car warms up and gets hot. The input shaft of the transmission is turning even when the clutch is depressed.

First I bled the system

That didn't really help either

On the test drive, I turned off the engine –– and then turned it back on to move the car –– and now it's hard to get the car back into 1st and reverse...as before. I can hear/feel the resistance of the shifter trying to move the gears.

It's too dark now to mess with the car and I'm just really frustrated. 

I know it could be a clutch or slave cylinder. If you know Saabs,400) and because the slave is inside the bellhousing, you just do that with the clutch. I would do the clutch myself, but it's a huge job and while I'm comfortable doing lots of mechanical work, a clutch job is just beyond my ability and schedule at this moment.

I'm going to take it to a specialist this week to see if he has special Saab bleeding tricks –– or to see if he can diagnose what's actually wrong.

1360619426.0,18c13b,2004 RAV4 - Blown head gasket due to coolant leak,doug4,6,0,13,"So I came across a thread this morning where one of the commenters mentioned that if you smell ""burnt maple syrup"" it means you have a coolant problem. That eventually led me here

A few months ago there was a terrible snowstorm and I lost control and hit a guard rail going about 20mph even with 4wd and traction control. It was a front end collision and needed a new bumper cover

When they opened everything up

Anyway

The first thing that I noticed when i got the car was a weird smell

As a sidenote, and I even drove it a few hundred miles one weekend and it was fine.

Now here starts the main problem:

3 full weeks after I picked the car up, other than being mad at the mechanic. So I continue driving on the highway, and after about 20 miles, the check engine light comes on. At this point, I thought I remembered looking at the temp gauge and it was normal, but the insurance inspector guy I talked to thinks that this is very unlikely. The ""VSC TRAC"" light came on at the same time, which is traction control

So I start driving the car easy since I'm almost at my destination. I start to notice the car making a putt-putting noise when I step on the gas. I roll to a slow stop at a traffic light. When it turns green, the oil light comes on and maybe another light or two. The time from the check engine light coming on until it overheated was maybe 2 or 3 minutes. Won't start back up, we had to push it to the side of the road and get it towed and in that time there was a big puddle after an hour from something leaking.

The new mechanic says that the engine overheated and it blew a head gasket and they want to charge me 5 hours to open the engine and see how much damage was done.

So I'm about up to the present on this story, but I don't know if that would cause such a drastic problem. I remember the Toyota Dealership said that my factory coolant was good for 100,000 miles, and I had 93k. So maybe if they put cheap coolant in there, this might be the problem?

Well I called the Insurance company and they're not going to cover anything - it'll be between the auto body and me. But they did send the original Appraisor out, the auto body might cover replacing the coolant or radiator or whatever, but they wouldn't take responsibility for the engine since I guess it was my fault for letting the car get to that point, even though everything happened in 2 or 3 minutes. Now I know I should have pulled the car over immediately, but this still sucks.

So

So my questions are:

Any idea what could have happened here?

Are there any cheap tests I should ask the mechanic to do? They wanted to take a look inside the engine

I'm worried that if I get a used engine, or just cut my losses and get a new car.

I am working on a 2005 F150 with a v6 in it. It has about 105

The PS fluid doesn't smell ""burnt"" and looks to be free of contaminants and at the proper level. Every time I have done a power steering pump the pump has whined like a mo fo when it went bad so am I safe to assume this PS pump is A-OK?

There are no leaks in the system

I am not super farmiliar with PS systems but they seem to be simplistic. Could this be a seal failure in the rack or something along those lines? Could the pump be failing without making any noise at all?

The belt is also in great shape and isn't slipping at all.

It's the rear passenger door and the liftgate in the back. The liftgate won't open and the lock on the inside of the passenger door will not even budge when I attempt to open it manually. I discovered both failures at the same time. 

The first Honda place I took it to said it was the acuators. Their total estimate for parts and labor to replace the actuators was $625.

I thought this was a horrible deal (afterall, but I need to be able to put my wheelchair in the back, so I called other Honda places in town to ask for estimates to replace the actuators in question.

I found a Honda place that gave a total estimate of $427.52 for parts and labor to replace the actuators

The second Honda dealer came to a different diagnosis that I have yet to fully comprehend (I just got off the phone with them)...something about the door handle on passenger doors ($288) and replacing the fuse box for the liftgate ($779!) ""because it's not receiving any power."" 

Which dealer is full of crap? Are these prices fair? Can these parts not be repaired rather than replaced? Is there a cheaper way for me to be able these door manually?

I'm pretty hesitant to invest a thousand dollars just to be able to open the doors on this car...doors that were working fine one moment and which just quit for no apparent reason. What use is this technology if it's so expensive?

I have already replaced the whole distributor and flushed my radiator of fluids and even replaced my radiator cap. The battery is also brand new. As of now I'm thinking it might be the main relay or the fuel pump but i have no idea how to check those. When I turn my key all the lights come on in the dash like normal and i can even hear my fuel pump click on and off when the check engine light appears.

**Edit 1:** So I tried to test the fuel pressure by loosening one of the nuts off the fuel filter to see if fuel would just spray out. Fuel does come out but it seems to be more like a trickle rather then spray. Also the tank does have fuel in it. 

**Edit 2**: Okay so I went and replaced the main relay and it still won't start. Like i said earlier

**Edit 3:** Something I noticed about my car is that there is a sticker that says something about an alarm along with a little red LED light near my steering wheel that looks a lot like an alarm of some sort. I purchased my car used and was never told anything about an alarm

**Edit 4:**Yeah we managed to troubleshoot everything else. I went and purchased starter fluid and was able to keep the car running by having my buddy spray into my air intake

Just to be sure I went and used electrical cleaner on a lot of my cables because of my paranoia. Wanted to make sure no moisture was in my plugs. I also cleaned my grounds to make sure there was no carbon build up. I even cleaned out my IACV just to check for air bubbles.

First off, and had the engine rebuilt last year (it's got about 12,000 miles on it).  The transfer case has been replaced, but that wasn't a new one, just lower mileage.  Beyond that, I haven't had much major work done to it, just maintenance and a few small repairs.

Last winter, I had to dig my way out.  I did however notice after that, that every time I have it in 4WD Hi or Full time (all wheel drive), it makes a clicking noise up front when I have my wheels turned sharp (like turning into a parking spot).
