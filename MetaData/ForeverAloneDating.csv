really is something special. I'm a 21yo guy who met this girl on reddit(r/foreveralonedating) on may 9th
and we started talking
and she in Washington state
skyping for about 5 to 7 hours a day for almost every single day for two months. Shes
so perfect and beautiful
than just being her best friend. I can talk about absolutely anything
with her
to talk and communicate is by far our best quality and what 
makes us strongest. So after I started getting feelings for her
it was really scary
already my best friend. So I tried to kinda ignore them and hope
that theyd go away but I soon realized that I was being silly.
I could have tried and convinced myself for weeks that she wasn't so perfect
for me and that she wasnt the sweetest girl Id ever met
just be me being in denial because she was all I thought of her and more.
Im 21 and shes almost 19
before we met
serious and only plan on being in one. We feel that a relationship
that starts should already at that point have certain 'vows' that
come with it
emotions. I always thought that when the right girl for me would come 
along
princess nothing has ever been more clear than our destined long
future together. 

A little less than two months after we first started
talking
biggest risk I ever took in my life. She was surprised and just 
confused at first
another time
and she was going away for the weekend
time for us to not be able to talk for a couple days. She did a lot
of thinking during her weekend away
again on Monday (it felt like a month away on Friday night)
said she also has feelings for me beyond that best friends have
and was willing to give a long distance relationship a try. 

This was July 9th
could honestly say I love this girl more and more each day. She means
the world to me and everything with her is just so effortless. We knew
from the beginning that a long distance relationship would be hard
we were convinced that theres nothing we wouldnt be able to work through. 
And we were right
nothing I dream of more than just being with her one night
will come and the wait would make it the best day ever
that day that most people would probably never come close to feeling. Theres 
no better feeling in the world than feeling loved for exactly who you
are
or try and do more than we were comfortable with
with each other all the time. We dont have to worry about us being upset with 
each other or even us not being together at any point
promised to work through all the issues that will ever come up
exactly what we've done so far. I know this might sound silly
my sister will always be my sister no matter what our future holds
is as just permanent of a girlfriend to me. We even picked out our kids name one day
already. We already told pretty much all our family about each other
started talking to and getting to know her friends and sister.

The reason we wanted to share this with you guys is so you realize that love
is out there to find
feel for each other because its truly amazing. Just keep at it
do yourself short. Theres someone out there that will make each of you feel
so happy and loved all the time
I never would have thought that I would find a girl for me in the next five years at least
but I'm blessed to have found her
and I cant wait to hear about all of you finding love so pure that it comes with 
zero doubts or second thoughts. Thanks for reading :)

As the title says, and learning how to make them. I'm just hoping to find someone who has the same amount passion for gaming that I do. Someone to stay up with until 4 am raiding on WoW, playing counterstrike, or maybe just some guitar hero. I do like to go out and party, but mostly I would just rather stay in and play games with someone I care about whether it be a computer RTS, console FPS, or a board game like munchkin or settlers of catan (although those probably wouldnt be as fun with just two people lol).

I'm not fat or anything. I'm 5'4"", I know I could easily go to any bar and find any good-looking douche to take home, but that's not me. The main problem I have in the dating world is that I'm a male-to-female transsexual. I pass 100% of the time and so I'm very nervous about going around dating guys and having to tell them this, knowing that if they wanted to, they could out me to other people. And at this point in my transition(I'm on hormones, been living as a woman for well over a year, and I've had my name and gender legally changed)

So if you're looking for a girl who loves anything and everything that has to do with gaming

I am 24 and living in Japan teaching English. It's a pretty awesome job and we get paid more than most of us should. Forced myself to come here so that I'd get out and meet more people

I am bad at being concise...

Rules say that I should say what is awesome about me?
Not... really... sure....

I am drama free and I don't think I've ever gotten in a fight with ANYONE (not counting family). Not sure thats a good thing.. but I feel as if I am logical most of the time and wouldn't freak out over stupid things. 

I'd like to think I am average in intelligence and not too bad looking. 5ft7 and 135lbs.. normalish..
I am a bit lazy
I don't play video games (well ok I do enjoy Yoshi's island on DS), but I don't like going out by myself so usually I sit at home while I should be out enjoying this awesome country.

I have kickass pet husky rats that do kickass rat things and are part ninja and I love them!  I will someday prove to my parents that someday a man will love me despite my choice in pets (they debate this...) I also love all other animals and have owned just about every type... 

I figure if the dating thing doesn't work out I'll just become a crazy rat lady and someday be found eaten to death by a hoard of rodents.


[](/party ""hover text"")  

You have to admit being eaten by the thing you love would be a cool way to go out.


I am OCD neat and tidy! I clean ALL of the things!

An ideal evening would be cuddling on a couch while watching an awesome zombie movie or something b-rated and amazingly bad while eating pizza ..or maybe pancakes... or both. I'd like to find someone who is a friend that wants to live a simple life together ...

1367586800.0,1dm7r2,How would r/ForeverAloneDating feel about a dating website that focuses on people's flaws?,copeman,33,5,24,"Hi r/ForeverAloneDating!

Firstly

I've been thinking for quite a while now about starting a dating website that only allows users to list their flaws, such as:

* it creates a less superficial dating environment
* it means users can feel more confident that they aren't being tricked into thinking someone has certain attributes when they might not
* it means that users can meet

I'm here to see how you guys would feel about this kind of format. Could it work for you? Could you see yourself signing up to something like this? 

It's not often that we meet someone already knowing their flaws. I think it could be a unique introduction to the saturated online dating world - but it would be great to see what you guys think. Thanks for your time.

I turned 20 within the last few weeks and I've decided to reach out online. I go to school full time, so all of that adds up to location and IRL type things being a non-issue. I like to be goofy and light hearted most of the time, but it generally makes people think that's all I am, but I also have a serious and somber side. I'd like to be able to find someone who I can feel comfortable acting either way. My friends think I'm a little boring because I don't like going out to clubs or parties, and I can't say I disagree. I'm a very empathetic and emotional person. 

My interests are writing, and the human experience/humans as a whole. (Does that make me sound pretentious? I swear I'm not!) Music is a big part of my life, and I really like too many bands to get into in a small space. I love movies and television too (okay, who doesn't?). I really like having in depth conversations and generally over-analyzing things I like, so if you have a crazy theory about the next Star Trek movie, or a truckload of opinions about the Christmas special of Doctor Who, don't hesitate. 

My favorite thing about relationships (platonic and otherwise) is getting really close with someone else: knowing all of their stories and their quirks, fears, and just generally feeling that emotional closeness.

**You are NOT doing yourself favors by waiting to show her your photo.**

It's become clear to me

Here's the thing: you think you will impress her enough that you will seem more attractive based on what she already knows about you. THIS IS NOT TRUE.

When women start talking to a guy, a girl is NEVER going to imagine someone hideous. We all HOPE you'll be attractive.

So when you finally do show her your picture, or you're unattractive, and she's disappointed.

THE OUTCOME WOULD BE THE SAME IF YOU'D POSTED THEM INITIALLY. With one tiny, because she is now comparing you to the guy she thought you'd be.

You have NOTHING to lose by posting your photo right away. NOTHING. The girls who pass you up would NOT have dated you if you'd waited to show your picture. A girl is not going to fall for your words, and then happily date you. That shit only happens in the movies with already reasonably attractive people.

 I especially love big band music, Armstrong, et al, would play.

  thrillers that make you go 'OHMYGOD' when you find out just who the killer actually was.

In a nut shell (and a possible tl;dr), and women are expected to be passive.

Now what do I mean by that? From my experiences and observations (and that's all these are) men are socially encouraged all their lives to ""seek out"" find and ""ask out"" the right girl. Their friends will tell them to go ask her out. Their parents will wonder when they'll ask a nice girl out. Their co-workers will ask why they DIDN'T ask out the girl they thought was cute. Because everybody expects men to be proactive in this regard.

HOWEVER!

Girls are socially indoctrinated from a young age to ""wait for the right guy to come along""

Our entire dating social structure seems to be needlessly bogged down in early 50's middle America!

Now

If you like somebody. Just tell them. If somebody likes you and is brave enough to say it

This isn't an issue exclusive to the real world either. You can see it on most dating sites if you start to delve into their communities, and [F4M] threads are almost never empty, and will have 4 - 5 response tree's, often with 5 or 6 extra unanswered comments below it all.

I'm sure to get a lot of responses saying ""There's more guys than girls"" or something to that effect. But I can't help but wonder if this social stigma isn't somehow related. The girls put themselves out there

I've been going back and forth on whether I should do this or not, and let me tell you, it's slim pickings for a girl like me. I'm not into racing or rednecks, i'm kind of a nerdy chick, so i've had a lot of bad luck. First, a little about me:

*I'm 24 years old

*I adore horror movies Nightmare on Elm St is my favorite! my friends describe me as ""creepy"" because i have an attraction to strange and unusual things. (you might see my name on the ""creepy"" boards a lot haha!) but on the outside i'm not that scary

*As I've mentioned before, i just like a couple of really good animes), and I dabble in comics and Lovecraft. 

*Alright, but I'm not skin and bones. I'm **average** and healthy. medium dark brown naturally curly hair (and i mean CURLY!) hazel eyes, a nose, a mouth, some appendages, ect. ect. I can send a photo if you pm me, but NOT for anything sexual

*I don't claim to be a 'gamer chick' but if you have a system and ask me to play i'll give it my best shot and have fun doing it :D

*I'm an avid reader

Alright, and cheated on 3 times. (that's the kind of caleber of men i'm dealing with out here.)  The unfortunate side effect of this is that i'm turned off of any man who looks like him (overweight with a beard), sorry. So, naturally, it takes a while to earn my trust. I'm not looking for a one nighter, or a sex-driven relationship. In fact, trying to get into my pants are a HUGE turn off for me. I want to get to know you, to be nerdy with

So, i tried! I'm open for friendship or something more. PM me if you would like to skype (again, nothing dirty/ sexual PLEASE.) it doesn't matter if your local or long distance, like i said i'm getting duds out here so i'm willing to broaden my horizon :D",,False,,False,t3_pqbpx

So then you message me...'Whoa! We actually have things in common!! You're telling me there's a girl who likes video games, she likes zombies too?' Then I'll correct you and say 'Fuck no! I hate zombies! That's why I buy games to kill them off and watch movies dedicated to their genocide and hope the human survivors win!!' Hopefully, those souls who understand my personality will see that when I say those kinds of things, I'm not being rude, I'm just fluent in sarcasm because those souls who do understand...maybe more then understand will lead them to perhaps my number...? But why should I tell you that? Because that's a spoiler :/

I guess by now I should reel back my post into something more traditional. I'm a college student going to graduate in May and hates to really talk about herself because it's all objectify-able. I love to make people laugh and be that person that makes a difference in someone's day if I can help it, I love art, music, games (cards, boards, video games, etc), and so much more.

So let me help you out. If you're down for late night bingo, then find a grassy soccer field to ramble about how deep our thoughts are when we're really just drunken fools instead and go to the nearest hotel for free breakfast....or to catch a coffee that's alright too, then you should consider messaging me. And if you don't know how to start you message, you should tell me something that you're very, VERY passionate about and tell me all about it because I would love to hear about it :)!! Perhaps I will reply with a picture if all is well. Sorry for the long message.

So I'm an adorable bundle of joy who enjoys playing video games. That's mostly how I spend my time. 
I usually play console or portable games. Mostly RPGs. I am very willing to play any MMOs that have great communities. I'm sort of into the anime scene but have more of an interest in manga and general Japanese culture.
I've been told I'm socially awkward and I have a rather small experience in the dating game. I'm extremely open to others ideals and opinions and tend to go with the flow.

My hobbies are...well..there's lots. I like astronomy

I'm a skier, and love to take vactions to the beach. 

I like to read

I like going to broadway. I've seen Phantom

My goals are basically to be happy and to make others smile. Not to descriptive

I am a trustworthy person. Kind, and friends with everybody (everybody is a potential friend :) ). I can go from the guy that lends his shoulder to the life of the party. I'm generally a happy person, that sometimes carries his heart on his sleeve. 

I was raised to be the kind of guy that holds doors, should be a habit, chivalry is not dead.....it just became less common.

I like all kinds of music. I don't really dislike anything

All and all, but above all...I do what I can for the smiles. I know useless triva..the kind of stuff that's cool to know...but won't get me food anytime soon :) I'm going to the gym to get a heathlier lifestyle up and going. 

I've bought a house a couple yrs ago, thats the whole bachlor lifestyle that I'm going to the gym to work off :) I like to hike, and go camping whenever. There's always something to do, at all times of the year. 

I'm a smart, but I always make things fun and interesting. I really enjoy understanding different points of view, learning about different cultures and religions (I'm also a bit of a political satire...ist :) . I also love to talk to people about anything in general, but a person that can have intelligent conversations with is hard to find.

I work in a hospital as an RN in post-anesthesia care and studying for certification in my specialty. I'll turn into Marge Simpson if I'm out in the humidity too long. See Exhibit A) the picture of me below in my scrubs and my crazy curly hair. I like being out at night, just to be clear. Being French and German kind of helps that out. I like Crown Royal, Hennessy, and in general darker liquor. I have Redbreast and Dalwhinnie in my apartment and at some point will grab a bottle of Macallan 18. I love seafood, and I'm originally from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. You should probably understand the sacred nature of a crab feast in the summertime. I listen to a variety of music, like We Are Scientists, Franz Ferdinand, Shiny Toy Guns and Fall Out Boy. I tend to sing along to Weezer and The Distillers. As you can tell by my Tosh reference

My interests are mostly outdoor: I love to hike. I love to explore in general. Some days I just feel like staying inside and watching a movie and snuggling ... [myself :(] I would love to go camping with someone and snuggle near a camp fire. I've been alone for too long: I mostly just want someone to share my life with. I like playing RPGs too. 

I wrote this a while back in a state of deep depression and loneliness 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/gmckv/i_just_want_to_be_loved/
So this reflects some of my personality. Admittedly it is a bit embarrassing to look back on. 

Why I'm forever alone: depression and somewhat awkward social skills. 

What I like in a potential SO: 
I want a genuinely sweet person who would also be patient and understanding of my depression. I would definitely return the favor with LOTS of love and make it worth it. The trait I want above all us is sincerity and a genuinely caring heart [Not to be bitter but this really does eliminate about 90% of people on OkCupid]. 

Other pluses though: 

*Introversion

*420/Psy friendly [I'm not someone who does psys / weed every night but occasionally I enjoy a trip. A few times a year sort of thing.]

*Likes to think about weird things and/or has a unique worldview


*Intelligence. Not like genius level

*Lives somewhat near by. Anywhere farther than NYC or central Pennsylvania would be too far. Close enough to at least visit on weekends. 

My AIM is ctbdenied. Feel free to IM me or pm me. Be aware that I leave AIM on all day and sometimes my computer randomly freezes. If I don't respond after a message just try again later.

Some of you may know me as Lurkin_Lobster, we have a great time in there.)

I'm 28

I have a job. I work nights at a family shelter. Not gonna make me rich but I like it.

I have an apartment with a roommate. 

I talk A LOT. This is not a great thing for everybody

Hmmm. I listen to a lot of rock music, but its still fun, screw it). I don't watch a lot of tv, I can cook decently, I'm very independent. I love learning how to do new things and my famous last words will probably be ""NOOOOO!!!!! I WANNA DO IT MYSELF!""

What I am looking for (and there is flexibility here

A man (obviously). I prefer to date guys my own age or older-I have been through a lot in life and although some of you younger guys are beyond nice

Please, for the love of fuck, have a job. You don't have to be rich, I'm not, but at least be able to take care of yourself. I'm not the type that will empty your wallet, I hate that shit, either to do it or have it done to me.

Honesty. It's key. If I find out you lied to me about something...see you later. I will answer absolutely ANY question you would like to ask me. Also

It would be nice if you didn't live at home with your parents

Things I award bonus points for:)

If you are musical-either you play or listen a lot. I love music and being able to share it with a SO would be so awesome.

You are spontaneous. That kicks so much ass.

You have ADHD. I have so much fun with others who have it...I really do.

What am I looking for? Well, preferably someone who is both friend and lover. I want to care, I want to feel, I want more than just the butterflies in my stomach that will inevitably fade because that's what happens when you fall in lust. It is so difficult to find that connection, even harder still to coax it into something lasting.

About me? Well, belly poking and snuggles, sports/sporty activities, staying active and enjoying the outdoors, yada, yada, yada. Am more along the lines of the quiet, curious and willing to learn, but I like to think of myself as easy on the eyes if you prefer dark-haired imps. Also

About you? Well, because we all know that like attracts like. Candor and compassion go along way, no? Yes, I have pics, but being an introvert, I would really rather the both of us feel comfortable first. No, I don't mean endless messaging/emailing, that's all

Bonus points if you dig Final Fantasy! We all know the best RPG ever made is FFJ6. Favorite character? Celes, duh! Suck it.

So I made one of these before but was a bit vague on honesty. 
:l

I have to say I love reptiles, 4 snakes)
Also a Savannah monitor

Pictures of mot of my critters: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/QyeIO#0)

Cuddle's is the biggest of my snakes who is on my computer desk. Id name the others but I don't want to confuse you. :B

Ive been bringing lizards/reptiles in general

But regardless of me loving reptiles way too much

I'm a girl! Another of reddit's worst nightmares! D: Cause we all know their's no girls on the internet. For all you know everyone here could be a *MANNNN BABY*.

Also I'm a huge goof. Tweak, ect ect....Sometimes I feel a bit hipster too. Since I'm the only one of my group of friends that's into Google+. Facebook is just too mainstream. -cool glasses-

I work in a sandwich shop that serves ice cream as well. Used to be a bartender until last month but had to give up one of my jobs since being in school full time was kicking my ass. I'm at a community college right now all set up for transfer to another school so have been applying applying applying! I'm a bit late on the school uptake but I'm making progress and have the determination prestige to do something great! And no one can stop me now! The world can come at me bro! I'm studying Art and Business or English. Leaning more towards the English side though the Business side would be smarter. :l 

I like that classy repetitive stuff all that's all the rage with kids these days! Like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLC8y_myEZc) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PSBwHeVCok).
haha. 

Actually I've always liked this music. but really I love anything. Soundtrack and electronic/house are just my two favorite genres of all the music genres. Also [Electro Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJFrqOMgvBI) music is FANTASTIC! Makes me feel like one classy mofo. 

I like to go to clubs and or raves when I can. Enjoy dancing! I party every once in a while and at least know how to have a good time. But not all the time.  Ent friendly to an extent. I'll join when I feel like it but it goes the same with drinking for me. Special events or parties and budgeting my time so it doesn't interfere with school and life itself. haha 

 I love aquariums, doing STUFF. Considering I know many people who actually don't do anything, I usually end up doing something myself or hiding at home for the remainder of a day, week, month. Whenever I decide to crawl out of the cave. 

I like philosophical discussions and video games. :D in fact I collect philosophy books, fps's, driving( Mostly a PC gamer as of late, but also PS3 and Xbox. Have a grudge against nintendo...sorry) . Favorite games are silent hill, alan wake, and bioshock. Completely in love with horror games despite how scared shitless I can get sometimes. haha. 


Hmm... now what are some other worst nightmares of reddit? I'm sure I fit in some of them somewhere. I'm conservative in that I wont ever be showing off on Gonewild like many of the people here gawk over. I love the community but hate its negativity and selfishness sometimes. But hey that's life outside the internet as well. 

I'm a person who talks to people O____O but am forever alone in the fact that I have no close friends to really connect with or even people to consider dating. Just coworkers and mutual respect/social skills in some regards.

But because of my quirkiness sometimes I'm the kid in the back who everyone picks on. Oh life. I'm not too hurt about it though. I just don't care if someone doesn't like me. :P why get your panties all in a bunch over it

I tend to push people away because of my insecurities, never been kissed, and I overthink every opportunity to engage in a healthy, non-platonic relationship.  It's like once someone expresses the slightest interest in dating me, I immediately panic and jump ship.

Maybe I'm oversimplifying things, and I would be able to venture out in the 'real' world and attempt it in an uncontrolled environment.

I'm Dave. I'm 24.

**What am I?**

I'm a dichotomy. I'm hard-headed, big-headed. I'm passionate about things until I'm not. I'm curious all manner of things and people until I know enough to lose interest, or know all I want to. I'm impulsive, compulsive, repulsive. I collect things that don't have any meaning except the fun of it- paperclips, old five pence pieces, newspaper clippings of pictures of squirrels.
I'm spontaneous, excitement, thrills; I seek out cosiness, conformity, normality. I'm wild, and untamed, but only in the way that a pre-domesticated animal might be; though it frolics in the fields, hungers for a home.
I like old books, old wine. I like the smell of an old bookstore, the sound of a babbling brook, the smell of rain on fresh-cut grass.
I hold ideals and principles close to my heart, not because I like the feel of the smoke filling my lungs.
I move to my own groove, bend rules, all because it pleases me to be just that little bit different, to ignore how society views me.
I don't care what people say
I am shrouded in mystery. I am laid bare for all the world to see.
I'm pretentious like a perfume advert
I'm all show and no substance
I'm complicated. I'm simple. I'm me.


**What do I want?**

I want someone to challenge me. Someone to have loud drunken discussions with, someone who has fire in their hearts and embers on their lips. I want someone who has certainty. I want someone who won't cling to like a lifebelt. I want someone who has their own world, their own life, whose orbit brings them to me but doesn't expect me to be there all the time. I want someone I can do things with, see things with, be things with. I want a woman who knows precisely how to be herself and does it wonderfully. I want someone with so much knowledge in their heads that they can't keep it all in, but who still wants to know more about the world. I want someone who looks at me with the same kind of wonder I look at them with.
I want someone who wants me.

I generally spend my days slogging through classes and lurking around the internet. I also work as a Residence Advisor at my university which is pretty good.

My favorite shows are some of the more popular ones; Doctor Who, Supernatural, as well as Psych, Teen Wolf (don't hate, haha), and the occasional episode of Castle. Movies are a similar genre/audience as well as superhero movies (my greatest weakness), and I also love movies from my childhood.

I also enjoy video games (WoW, movies, tv shows, reading good books and relaxing. When it comes to movies, my favorites are Star Wars and about every Disney movie.

So, the void within me became the sole thought in my mind. I feel that I am always missing something, endlessly searching for the companionship of like-minded people. Especially searching for that one person who is going to fill in the emptiness. I know there are other people like me out there, and I am looking to find a few more. I’ve had some luck through Reddit before, and I’m hoping I’ll be even luckier by making my own post.

* Looking for a relationship? PM me. I prefer the chubbiest, even just a little tiny bit, PM me, goddamnit.

And this is where I leave you with a short description of myself! I’m intelligent, I’m thoughtful, and I can be worth your time. I’m also fat AND confident. Deal with it. Ultimately, I am a real person. There’s no bullshit with me. I don’t play games. I don’t pretend to be something I’m not. I’m not the most intelligent person out there, but I’m still pretty damn proud of myself. In fact, I would humbly enjoy speaking with those of you more intelligent that me, as I am always looking to further my experiences in life. That’s always a good way to keep my ego in check. I also have a crazy sense of humor. I love to laugh. Life can be so much fun with the right people.

I love going to the beach and I love to take photos so I'm all for activities where I can take a camera. I'm horrible at most sports but hey I'll humor you anyway because I wouldn't dare be rude. 

Basically I'm into music

Music: Poets of the Fall, Alexandra Stan, Wisin y Yandel, Reik, Sara Tavares, Da Weasel, DJ Roger Sanchez

Tv: Dexter, South Park, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, Grey's Anatomy, Modern Family, Royal Pains, Law &amp; Order SVU

Movies: The Avengers, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast Five, old James Bond movies, Mars Attacks, Snow White &amp; the Huntsman, Batman movies!

Sports (I watch): Football (Soccer), NFL &amp; Basketball.

If you have any questions then ask me. &amp; to make things easier now here's [a picture of me](http://i.imgur.com/SgA7Y.jpg)! Thanks for taking the time to read this incredibly long post!

Honestly, and now that I'm out of college I see the internet as being my best bet for finding someone who shares my interests. I also try bars and nightclubs, but to be honest I find it very frustrating because it's often too loud and distracting to really talk to someone and the drinks are overpriced.

Uh…Hi.

I’m looking for a guy in the Knoxville area to get to know in a friendship setting at first… and then who knows.

A little about me:

    * Currently a senior at UT with hopes of going to grad school maybe somewhere in California.
    
* I like to read

* I frequent r/trees :3

* I apparently suck at video games, but I don’t have a console. If you have some serious patience and can stand a girl getting worked up and cursing like a trucker, I’d love to have someone sit down and show me the ropes.
 
* I get along better with guys than with girls. I have a lowbrow sense of humor. What can I say

* I'm a bit shy at first

*I love horror movies ( Can’t wait to see Paranormal Activity 3)

My version of a good first date is hanging out

I’m looking for a guy to get to know who preferably is either in school or working, someone who can make me laugh, someone who loves to just relax and is easy to talk to and….fuck I don’t know. Is awesome

Video games are my big hobby. I've been playing them since my second birthday when I got Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. I'm into action/adventure, text adventures, and platformers.

I also enjoy programming. I know PHP and am learning more about C and Python. I have a few project ideas I'd love to share and brainstorm with others. My endgoal in programming is to make my own video games. I'm aiming to make classic-style 2-D games with modern sensibilities

I don't always read... *but when I do* it's Chuck Palahniuk, stuff like that. I've been meaning to read Plato and Aristotle, 1984, Animal Farm, and other classics. Most of the time I forget I own a Kindle and instead end up watching win/fail or prank videos on Youtube. Sound familiar? We might get along.

What I'm looking for is someone who's a bit more progressive and open-minded. Someone not religious. Someone who's been burned and lied to a few times

I'm not one for small-talk, game design, philosophy, fulfilling weird curiosities, and Internet politics (seems to be common here on Reddit :)).

I'm into action and comedy movies, and billiards, and get really goofy/funny once I open up.

On that note

I guess that was sort of awkward... but it's good to know if someone's a stupid-ass or smart with booze

I'm looking for someone that can show me the beauty of the world. I feel like society as a whole is changing. The values once held in high regard by many people have given way to drunken shenanigans, and a general lack of respect for others. Now, I know these things have always existed to some degree, but I feel like all of this has become more prevalent with the advent of (and near dependence on) social media.

That's not to say that I'm some old fogey that wants to abolish women's rights or some stupid thing like that. I'm also not some religious zealot. I just... place more on values than the majority of people I've met in my generation.

About me: I'm a guy who loves anime, and losing myself in a good book. I was raised by older family members and this is reflected on how I view life. I'm a bit on the chubby side these days (thanks to a depression that I've recently overcome), but that's changing. Relief of stress does wonders for one's metabolism. About you: Intelligent with good moral character and not afraid to fight for what you believe in. If you frequent bars or get high, I can already tell you we're incompatible. Sharing interests is a plus, but we can learn the interests of each other if we feel a connection elsewhere. A keen desire for developing something long-term is appreciated. Also, if you can LITERALLY show me beauty through some awesome photography skills, that would be a major bonus.

A little about myself:

I live in Michigan. I am a naturally shy and reserved girl. Once I get to know a person, have a good sense of humor, and am probably the most laid-back girl there is! 

Some things I love include playing video games, watching anime/tv shows/movies, and playing tennis/volleyball. I am the type of girl who would be happy simply cuddling up and spending the day playing video games/watching movies or spending the entire day adventuring outdoors!

PM me if interested! (:

* Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker.

Alright, soaking up the sun, and just enjoying nice weather - but I also enjoy cuddling up in bed with a good book/movie. 

I enjoy all kinds of music, and the gothtacular. I've been listening to a lot of Depeche Mode and The Sisters of Mercy recently. (If you see someone in black clothes and heavy eyeliner in Kansas, it might just be me - not many of us around here.)

Currently I work at a deli/catering service. I really enjoy the work, crafty things, reading, gaming (I'm a huge D&amp;D nerd and I wish I could find a group around here, but I also love vidya games), exercise (if it's something fun, it's not like exercise at all!), I kind of like to drink a little. Sorry.

Here's the catch: I am not a small woman. However! I have lost 95 pounds

Other random shit I like: Firefly/Serenity, Twin Peaks, Being Human (U.S. &amp; UK both), Lost Girl, Family Guy, American Dad, horror movies, survival horror/psychological horror

I'm looking for a chat buddy

I am 25 years old, auburn hair, brown/green eyes, and Irish looking.  (I have a picture and will send it to you if you are interested =D)

My main hobby, Team Fortress 2, and Tera.  I will be picking up Diablo 3 when it comes out to burn time until Guild Wars 2 launches.  I have a PS3 that I often times neglect but just got Journey on it.  I also have a DS3D and have been playing Pokemon on it :)

My other hobbies include snowboarding in the winter, and watching professional SC2.

I have just recently (past year or so) really started to get myself in shape.  I lead a physically healthy lifestyle and have actually started to enjoy running.

A girlfriend nerd!  The most important part of a relationship, go on a run or walk together, travel around and see parts of the world together.

For physical qualities, and white (pale?) over tan.  That last one is a little weird but I figured I would throw it in there.  While personality is much more important to me...I feel that couples should also be physically attracted to each other!

If you are socially awkward and/or insecure about yourself then keep reading.
I'm a nice guy. Sometimes I'm too nice. I've chosen not to objectify women. I treat people like people. But that doesn't mean I won't give special treatment to a date.
I'm full of insight (at least that's what my friends say). 
I'm a patient person too. I have 2 ears and 1 mouth so naturally I tend to listen more than I speak. 
Play video games? Read books? Do you constantly crave information? I totally dig that

since i can relate to the social anxiety alot of people here on FA are experiencing i thought why not take a shot at getting into contact. 

I am aware that the chances of anyone finding the love of their lifes here are pretty slim so i am not expecting anything serious. A pressureless conversation with a like minded individual though would be a fresh breath of air.

First a bit about myself.
My current

**-Animes and Mangas** (*i rather like the classics like Berserk

**-Video Games** (*mainly story driven or creative ones*)


**-Books** (*i haven't read a whole lot which i would like to change*)

**-Onthology and science**


I am studying geology right now and consider myself an atheist. My actual opinion about religion is a bit more complex though

Even though what i have written about me until know seems like the standart FA loner/nerd which i undoubtedly **am** it is not exactly the person i **want** to be. I have a deep desire for doing the unconventional

I had these fantasies for quite some time but usually the daily routine of playing games and surfing on the net which i am so used to comes back at me. But now that i have some free time and an (hopefully) iron will i plan to seriously try and change myself slowly into a me that enyojs actual living more.

Another part i wouldn't mind changed about me are my social insecurities of course (otherwise i wouldn't be posting on FA). I have kind of come to terms with them to a certain degree and think that don't minding solitude is in a way part of who i am but i would really appreciate to share my thoughts and all with more close friends and possibly someone i love. If i'd never find it so be it no use crying over spilled milk but i have a feeling that getting closer to who i want to be gets me closer to finding that as well.

Well, perferably from the opposite sex, in order to learn a little more about how you come to and deal with those problems and how women think in general because i never really had much female friendships this would be an oppurtunity for me to learn more about talking to girls and other people in general. I just think that two people thinking of themselves to belong into the category of being ""Forever Alone"" could help each other more effeciently than one could do so *alone*.

If you want to know anything else just ask.

First of all

A bit about me: I'll be 20 in ~1 month, when I was writing this, I was streaming Game 6 (Boston vs Chicago, because I don't have a TV), I'm supposed to be studying for a statics (not statistics) midterm, and I love drinking water.

I'm not a huge movie/TV person, but ever since my knee started acting funny (about 3 years ago), I've stopped and now I just play for fun. Video games.. I don't really play video games anymore. Probably because I didn't bring a console with me, which is probably because I don't have a TV here. Why not PC? Because none of my friends play MapleStory anymore. Just kidding, I play VN's, if that counts.

Things that'll make you lose your interest: I have never consumer alcohol, African-American, East-Asian, or Hispanic. *watches as everyone leaves lololol*

If you have an awesome hobby I bet I would like it. (excluding underwater basket-weaving.) I love books, old and new, If you like ancient history I am your guy, Neil Gainman is a good friend my favorite author. I love movies too and video games.

Hello, chemistry, these are some of the things I am the most interested in, but I dabble in everything else, history, art, literature, philosophy, who doesn't love itemized lists? I know I do.

* Movies – Repo! The Genetic Opera, all the Monty Python movies, A Clockwork Orange, This is Spinal Tap, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, anything on Netflix, etc. 
* Shows – NOVA,  Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead. Anything except reality TV and game shows, really. Netflix applies to this section as well.
* Games – Electronic and otherwise. I recently finished Tomb Raider and I am currently spending my time playing Minecraft and Tera. I'm also working my way through the most recent humble bundle and loving Super Hexagon and Solar 2. I also like tabletop games
* Music – I am a big fan of Classic Rock. The Beetles, The Kinks, etc. Classical would be my second favorite. I am particularly fond of powerful piano pieces. After those two everything evens out. I like pretty much everything and will give anything a shot. I believe I mentioned I was a generalist before. 

Currently I'm still and undergraduate and I'm looking at graduate school. I think what I would like to do would be to teach at some level, but in my free time I can be found with my nose in a book, playing a game, watching the newest episode of Archer with a friend, or if it is the weekend, maybe out hiking on the hills and mountains around where I live. I prefer small groups of close friends over things with lots of people, so it is very seldom that I will go out to a bar or something. I also love to ponder. How and why are the most exciting things to think about for most things. Who, where and when are also fun

I guess what I'm seeking is to meet new people and make new friends. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I'm more than 50 miles from the closest Wal Mart if that is any indication. That is what makes the internet so great. I've met people from every continent. Except Antarctica. If you have ever spent time in Antarctica then I definitely want to talk to you.

I have been a Reddit lurker for years and it's a real testament to my foreveralone-ness that my very first post should be a self ad. 

A little about myself and then I'll mention what I'm looking for.

I'm a very athletic, or a big party animal. None of those are true. I have learned to fit in with the ""normals,"" but in fact I'm a total nerd. I play computer or board games, browse imgur,  read fantasy novels, or watch various shows like Dexter for the majority of my free time. However, as mentioned above, bike, several times a week. 

I'm looking for a girl who shares my interests in both worlds

Random factoids: I ride a motorcycle, play too much League of Legends, graduated with a BS in Biology and I'm not using it, was born in Bulgaria, eggs are my comfort food, sleep with socks on, am a terribly spontaneous shopper

**Location:**

**Occupation: (feel free to be vague!)**

**Some interests besides Reddit:**

**Your personality:**

**Where you are looking for this to go:** (1 night/fwb/casual dating/friendly companionship..whatever!)

**Sexual Preference:** (straight/bi/gay whatever floats your boat :))

i play piano &amp; have a really old moog that i pretend i'm good at using. i've also been vocally trained since i was seven

&amp; my biggest guilty pleasure is cosplaying. my roommates all make fun of me when a new wig comes in the mail &amp; i freak out

i'm open to a lot, has tattoos, &amp; elegantly disheveled hair. this is negotiable, though. i just really dig the hipster look.

You might think that there's not much you can achieve with only 30 minutes effort but I assure you, but if you feel particularly stuck the proof that change is happening can be just the kick you need to get you going. There's also something very empowering about making a commitment to yourself and to others. And then delivering on it.

I think that telling a girl you have low self esteem right off the bat is usually a terrible dating strategy but I'm hoping this is a place where I can find someone who empathizes. I can be very shy, but I am also super kind, independent, and open minded. I don't like to be pressured and I am very cognizant of not pressuring others. I'm not perfect but I have a lot to offer someone else who might be lonely. 

I like to go for walks, read, and play video games or board games. I love to try new places to eat and I am a vegetarian. I don't have much spare time recently because I work both a full time and part time job. The weather has been so fantastic this week I have been wishing I had someone's hand to hold while I walk.

I don't like to party or go to bars unless it is a very small gathering. I rarely drink although I do smoke weed. I dream of a relationship where my partner really enjoys just spending the night inside together.

1366341379.0,1cnmat,[M4F]29 Let's beat depression (and social anxiety) together!,willingtolive,9,0,5,"Hi! Let's begin with a the short version of a long story:


When I was around 17 I suddenly lost interest in everything and quit high school. I basically lived in my parent's house doing nothing for a couple years until I was offered a job. I worked for a couple more years
 
Due to an event that would have traumatized anyone, and based on my history it probably started way back in high school. Since nobody including myself ever really thought of seeking treatment (my parent's thought I was just mellow and I thought adult life was just really hard).


Fast forward to today. I'm on medication that has had a profound effect on me. I want to get better. I want to have a life where I look forward to the future. Though my mood and general outlook have improved considerably

Anyway, and even maybe we could help each other. Okay I know you're thinking ""Everybody has that same idea it isn't original and &lt;insert possibility of success&gt;"". Giving up before I try something was the old me. Now even though I'll probably fail (yay negative thinking), at least I'm moving forward (sort of). It doesn't even really have to be a romantic relationship (although that'd be nice). Best thing is, because I once wanted to kill myself and have lived a life of constant emotional pain, I don't get upset very easily (I get truly angry maybe once every other year). So as long as you keep talking, no matter what you say, there is almost NO way you can A) Weird me out, C)Make me judge you. So if you're looking for the person who might be immune to whatever reasons you think nobody will ever accept you for

Now I do have to include a disclaimer that I am still technically depressed

Shoot me a message! Operators are standing by! (Well at least one of them :D)

for the tl;dr version just read the post title :P

I'm new-ish to Vegas, but I sleep through most of the morning and spending time with the same two people every evening before work is wearing on my sanity. 

Which is where you come in. If you've got some free time between noon and 7pm, play some video games, watch Netflix, chat and hang out. I'm a homebody naturally, but I'm willing to go out and do stuff if it fits in my schedule and I don't have to work too hard at it. Really it's a matter of effort vs. reward, I'll play in a pickup football game once a month, because I like playing football, right?) because I have exactly 0 interest in baseball. 

I am interested in writing, and the free-thinking politics of the 70's. 

I'm laid back, and I'm not a complete idiot to boot. If you're cute, I'll flirt. If you play games, I'll try to recruit you for my tabletop night. If you get sad when you drink, I'll tell you it's a bad idea for us to drink together and then do it anyway.

Lets see here, have long hair, and yes, I do indulge. People are often freaked out by how chill I am, and I think I can attribute that to the fact that there really isn't much that gets under my skin. Pretty much unless is deliberately trying to piss me off, I can shrug anything off.

I cook! Yes

I've got a job in IT and I love it. It's decent pay for my experience, in my field of study! Basically, I work as a software tester. My last client was Disney. Pretty interesting story that one.

Nerdy things, RTS, and FPS games almost exclusively. My current gaming list includes halo 4, Borderlands 2, and smite. I also recently picked Magic back up. It is the oldest and best CCG ever to exist. I am also a very vivid Whovian.

I'm not very into sports

I'm all about my music. I listen mostly punk rock, Flyleaf, Nightwish, Sirenia, Evanescene, Sonata Arctica. Less than Jake, and Streetlight Manifesto. 

Well, right? I'd like somebody that can enjoy going out and having fun, but is just as happy staying in and being lazy. I think ink is hot, but I currently have none of my own. Similar taste in music is pretty important too. Finally, I believe a relationship should be a partnership, and the best ones involve both people doing everything they can to make each other happy. I do not want and never will want somebody who's ambition is to be the best housewife they can be. Finally, I'd prefer somebody who lives nearby

Last but not least, I'll open up once I know you, but in general I'm below average in the quiet department. Secondly, some may refer to me as clingy. I like physical touch and while I'm not at all controlling or obsessive, communication at least daily is important.

That's about it. In a bit I'll put some sort of picture of me up here. I'm not trying to hide anything :p

A bit about me, Live in Minnesota, am 6 feet tall, brown hair blue eyes 208 pounds, and I have a few screws loose.

Mostly the boring screws

Some more random stuff about me!

I am smart and fun loving and adventurous and kind and romantic. I will take you fun places and tell you interesting stories and make you laugh with my zanny antics and will write you poems and sing you terrible love songs.

Or maybe thats just how I see myself? I dont know. Introspection is so weird.

I do know that I like outdoor stuff, were I go to replenish my soul. and blow up microwaves. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.

I am also for sure a nerd. I like comic books and anime and manga and video games and talking about computers and scinece and stuff. I am also very adventurous, normal hiking, road trips, canoe trips, I've done them all!

I am also probably one of the most polite people you will ever meet. yay for shaking hands and please and thank you!

If I had to describe my self in one word

Enough about me and my self delusions

Well, a smart girl. If you read books, watch/read the news, and are interested in knowing for the sake of knowing, then you are the girl I am looking for!

But that's a bit broad... I guess what I am specifically looking for is someone I can go on adventures with. A girl I can randomly call up and say ""wanna go sledding?"" and you will say ""LETS DO IT"" and we go sledding.

Or a girl who is willing to put up with frequent pauses in the conversation as we mull over the implications of various philosophical topics. And then we say screw it and make Calvin and Hobbes snowmen on the side of the road and see how much we can slow down traffic.

You have to be nice and stuff too. That more important then the other stuff.

So ladies, in fact if you are a cyborg by all means reply. I have always wanted to meet a cyborg....

Wait

If you are a dude, if you are reading this and you think to yourself ""this guy sounds like lots of fun to go on an adventure with"" you should Pm me as well. I am always in the market for new friends.

Never thought I'd be doing this and I don't know exactly what to call what I'm looking for, both of which I am good friends with. However I have as of late been feeling rather lonely. At first I thought it was home sickness, but I am pretty sure the root cause is simply the lack of community I have here combined with zero women that I find attractive. So enough with the sob story... I'm looking for an upgraded pen-pal I guess. I have a couple pen-pals from /r/penpals[1] [1] (which is really cool btw), but I am now looking for a woman close to my own age (+ or - 5 years) that is willing to be penpals, and if things work out, consider taking things a bit deeper and more intimate emotionally. I don't want to force anything though, and I'm always up for more pen-pals if that's the case! So Yeah, In Burundi you don't date... you just get married...). I'm not looking for smutty pictures or people that want to sext or whatever. I'm more interested in just getting to know some women my age and being able to talk about random shit from the woes of university or co-workers, and everything. 

That was quite a wall of text. Anyway a little about me for those of you who haven't already closed the tab. As I said, and graduated with a double major in philosophy and geography. I don't know why I chose those other than I like thinking deeply and I liked taking classes where I got to color maps instead of writing essays. now, I'm in Gitega, Burundi, teaching at a new private school. This christians organization got the idea it'd be smart to bring a couple white folks out to build their new school. So that's what we did. I designed the curriculum, and now I'm teaching technology. After my time here, I have no idea where I'll end up, and I have a love for film, and reptiles. I am a staunch atheist. I like extremes and tend to sway towards them. Um... what else??? Well that's either enough for you to PM me or close the tab I guess. Either way if you got this far, and please don't waste my time if you think you might be the kind of pen-pal to just suddenly stop writing! Those people suck! 

Also, I would consider looks in order to move anything into the ""upgraded"" pen-pal status, so a picture of you would be nice :-)

1347038345.0,zij2p,40 M4F Cake Day attempt from Eastern Washington State,,10,1,0,"So the long and the short of it is that it's my first cake day on reddit and I really don't have anything interesting to post. I've been following this subreddit since very early on

Yet here I am. I am in fact 40 years old, but I still get carded going into bars (which I don't do but maybe once or twice a year) or buying alcohol in stores (again, don't do much, about once a month I get a six-pack of beer). Despite being FA, I still have high standards. If you are older than me, I'm probably not going to be interested. If you weigh more than me, I'm also probably not going to be interested.

I have an old picture somewhere (probably 4 or so years old) that I could share. I don't have much of an ego

So what do I do? I tell people I do as little as possible. I, I am on disability and don't work. I did manage to struggle through college and got a bachelor's degree in Anthropology. Most of my day is spent, currently (my interests can fluctuate frequently) playing EQ2 or trying to read classic novels. Currently I'm reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Typically I read sci-fi and fantasy. Some TV show I currently am watching: The Big Bang Theory, HIMYM, Doctor Who, Weeds (DON'T KILL ANDY!), Fringe

So, I am FA and SAP, and I might simply not know what to say or how to respond.

I am a 21 year old male Electrical Engineering major at Texas A&amp;M

I'm going to be very busy and won't have much free time during the semesters as a lot of it will be spent in lab/studying

I have very strong political opinions, passionate curiosity and deep discussion tends to turn off most girls I've met. But, if you are ready to talk about the rate of change of technology and how it shapes the world around us, what wave-particle duality really means for existence, or why people behave the way they do, etc., I would love to have someone to talk to - especially if they have input back. There is little I love more than listening.

I will be up front: I am a bit out of shape. Starting August

Also, and when my parents cut me off financially we got married for the tax benefits that would allow us to get grants and loans to pay for school. Between financial stress &amp; her very different moral system, when she changed birth control it all broke. However, as someone who was married for 6 months, I do know what kind of dedication it is, and am capable of commitment - that said, just getting out of a divorce, and if they go well

I've probably ruled out a lot just by being in College Station, but if you've spent the time to read this, and are interested, send me a message. If I don't get back to you immediately worry not; it may be a few days because of school/work/etc., but the response will come.",,False,t5_2sdpe,True

I'm an 18 year old female who will soon be fleeing suburbia and moving to Manhattan for college. I feel that my entire life has been the preamble to actually emerging into the world and exploring the dark corners and dusty recesses of my own brain. 

My favorite show ever is Firefly, and yes, Wow. I write poetry and love to thrift shop. I have been working on a book for the past two years, but it's not nearly well-written enough to be published. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies and criticizing/reviewing them. I like to think I have a good sense of humor. I'm ""weird.""


I have never been close with anyone, I get along with older people. I'm definitely an introvert, but I'm comfortable in social situations. I hate Disneyland.  I'm a night person. I love experimenting with drugs and altered states of consciousness. I'm really pretentious when it comes to music and literature. It's something I've devoted a large portion of my life to, and I'd love to discuss it at length. I'm not at all athletic or interested in sports, so if that's important to you we probably won't get along so well. 
 

Age doesn't much concern me, we can hang out in the fall. I'm blonde, 5'6, 115 lbs, and I get freckles in the sun. I'm attracted to people much smarter than I am and people who can show me new things. I don't really care what you look like, as long as you take care of yourself and present yourself well. Most importantly, I want to talk to a person who can intellectually challenge me and form mutual trust. I have no one in my life that I can tell everything to

I should start by talking about me! I am 25 years old

I graduated college about 2.5 years ago and have had a steady job since. My hobbies would include video games, music, snowboarding, paintballing, and anything else nerdy really.

What I am looking for in a girl is fairly simple. I am looking for someone who is ready to date seriously. I am ready to retire from the single scene and settle down with someone. Some attributes that I deem desirable in a girl: Live a healthy lifestyle! Be a nerd! Be friendly and optimistic rather than depressing and pessimistic! Be cute! Don't expect me to do everything to push the relationship along! (I seem to have bad luck when it comes to this one)

I am totally fine with things starting out as a long distance relationship. If things really work out then we can figure out the logistics of getting physically together later on :).

Why am I posting on reddit do you ask? Well

This ended up much longer than I had initially intended. To sum up: I am a 25 year old nerd that is tired of being single and ready to settle down with a nice girl. I hope to hear back from some of you :)

I'm a college student getting a degree to go into a really stable and lucrative field. I've got a great set of friends, hobbies, goals, the whole nine yards. The big problem is that I'm in an area of the US that I really dislike. The people around me are, for the most part, extremely conservative politically and very Christian, which is not how I am, but has become somewhat exhausting

I'm both a really serious and really goofy person. I take everything I love with great importance, try my hardest to be there for all of my friends. I'm a pretty smart person, and I love having conversations about big picture philosophy and pop culture and media and the meaning of life and tons of other cerebral stuff. But it gets exhausting sometimes, and I also enjoy watching cartoons, making dumb puns, talking in weird voices, and being generally immature. I really can't get along with anyone who can't have that sort of duality in their personality. Also, but don't we all?). I've been working toward changing my habits to a more healthy

Relationships can't be built on common interests alone, sharing theories and favorites and generally analyzing it all. Im also really inyo music and seeing live shows, but my tastes are a little odd in that realm. My biggest obsession right now is the ASOIAF series; I'm in the middle of the second book but caught up on the GoT show and could basically talk about that for half a century or so. I love tons of books, sci fi and fantasy as well as realism and just plain fiction. As for TV, I love Community, Arrested Development, Archer, Breaking Bad, especially human-interest type ones that follow one or several people. I've never been able to outgrow Disney films, but monsters and death (I've watched several documentaries on the funeral industry and am totally fascinated by it.) 

Overall, and I like to see that in others as well. I find myself most attracted to compassionate and considerate guys. If you have your own interested and passions and goals in your life that you get excited about, then we'll probably get along just fine. I'm searching for someone I can have tons of late nights talking and laughing on Skype and really connect with. I like body types of all shapes and sizes; I really fall for faces more than anything.

Basically, with varying amounts of effort &amp; varying yet little success. I mean, on the surface of it I don't think going out with me would be a particularly bad deal. I'm college-educated and I've got a good job and make good money, but I've never flaunted it. I'm probably a totally average 5/10 at best in the face, but I'm fairly fit and tall. I am generally a bit of a homebody, but I always get my ass in gear and plan things out when I'm going out with someone. I try to consider people as they are rather that according my expectations of them. Ditto for the relationships themselves. I'm good at taking criticism -- as long as it is immature or hateful, and I'll always take the fact that someone's stuck around over it. Sometimes I think people take me too seriously, live and let live views that I think would appeal to most anybody who considers themselves insane, but I still have passions and relate to people who are passionate too. I go well with fanboys &amp; girls, people seem far too reserved and unnecssarily ""hard to get."" I think the world'd be nicer if we were less isolated on average.

And I mean, you're healthy, consider average looks at best or better, and have similar world views you're solidly in the running. And by healthy, I don't even necessarily mean skinny, I can dig a curvy girl too. You wouldn't even really need to have your life together. Honestly, I'd love to have someone rely on me (see title). I'm pretty suspicious of permanently happy go lucky people

Ah well. This stream of consciousness has dried out, grab a throwaway and send me a message. I'd like to keep things anonymous to defer any pressure to not be completely open. I highly doubt I'll get more than a message or two, but I'll just let you know if I'm already chatting with someone. I don't like half-assed chats and I won't subject you to one.

1373233522.0,1htny1,27 [m4f] SW Missouri - I just want to find a good woman.,ridebikesgetnaked,8,1,8,"I've sorta given up on chasing women around downtown

It's so hard to find women my age that aren't taken or drunks in my town.  Is it too much to ask to find someone who wants to possibly build a relationship together?  

I'm 27 years old, green eyes and 160lbs.  I've been told I am good looking and I take care of myself, so I sorta think it's true, haha!  

My main problem with dating recently is that there is no real good place to meet women my age in this town besides (a) when I am at work (and I feel creepy hitting on women that come in) and (b) at the bar (which I am SO over.)  Most of the women I have met here are flighty and are not looking for a future

So yeah, riding/racing bicycles, hanging out, gardening, watching funny stuff on netflix, exploring, roadtripping, fishing and doing silly stuff.  I just want a partner to share this life with and to build a future with (if it feels right...)

I want to fall head over heals in love with a beautiful woman, nice house with a big back yard and a garden and just love as much as I can.  I love having someone to cook with, to clean the house with, to go on road trips with, to lay in the back yard and watch the stars with, just to be with!

**What I Like:** I'm in to gaming and not much else, and DoTA2. As for TV I like Frasier, anything on Cartoon Network, American Dad and Conan. Lately being on my own I find myself doing more and more handiman type things to get by, like mowing, painting, which i enjoy. I've even had a little experience as a librarian and a landscaper recently. My favorite food is chinese but my favorite meal is fish and chips.

**Who I Am:** Im 5'11"" 190-195lbs. Brown hair, I was raised and taught with honor, respect, and the golden rule. Being out on my own has humbled me quite a bit, I'm bad with people and a quiet person so directly asking people out who I find attractive has always been awkward for me.

**Who I'm Looking For:**What I would love is someone who is just starting out

Well then, I will never want to, nor will I ever be, be the sort of person that gives up on living life for their work. I am also rather romantic. I'm the type of person that wants to help as many people as possible make their lives better, and that just gets compounded in a relationship. I've also considered the possibility that I just get a kick out of her bragging to her friends :p I can also be a bit reserved, especially around somebody new, but I'm not akward.

I'm also a hopeless nerd. Dr. Who is the best show ever crafted by human hands. I also play many different video games, Pokemon, Borderlands, MTG, Smite, LoL, WoW, I can't sit on my ass for than about a day without wanting to do something. I spend a lot of time at the family lake place, hiking

I get real into my music, Streetlight manifesto, Rise Against, Nightwish, Flyleaf, Paramore, Sonata Arctica, and Blind Guardian.

I believe that a relationship should be a team effort. Couples where the guy does everything for the girl and vice versa are complete abominations of the definition. As a fair warning though

Now, and I'd hope you would at least be able to speak to me. Distance isnt a huge concern for me, but I would try to fix that as soon as it is reasonable. Short hair, ink (to a level), and hair dye are hot. You should also be a self-proclaimed badass. Being a bit kinky never hurt either.

I enjoy films, going out for meals, or cooking, I pride myself on being a good cook. Reading, gaming etc, all the usual.

I can't dance

I'll try most things, do new things. One day I'd love to travel, perhaps write a book about what I've seen and done..

I'm shy but when I eventually become less shy, but I think sitting around and playing dungeons and dragons while having some drinks with friends is pretty much an ideal Saturday night.

They are all incredible men who have more or less mastered their medium and who get paid to do what they love. They also go out of their way to do great things for people without a thought. It's my dream to have that freedom sometime before I die.

My dream is to eventually be a creative writer in some capacity working in film, despite my being allergic to them (cats, not people, I think).

You can ask any further questions on these at anytime.

I'm the guy who doesn't really see the world and people the way others do. I have multiple perspectives that makes things easier to understand but harder to chose. I'm not shy, if a friend of mine needs me then I'll drive or fly to see them, no questions asked. I'll be selfless to a certain point in order to help someone who's willing to help themselves. I judge others at times but I'm always polite and friendly to them. I'll usually tell you how I see things and the way they are, I don't sugarcoat things either like some people do. I don't lie, or at least I'm very conscious of it so I tend not to by catching myself and I feel bad and correct it. I see good in everyone, I see potential or opportunity in everything, and I'm just a general life enthusiast.

Nearly every single girl I've talked to, then she's either lingering in limbo because of a lack of communication (distance) or because we don't hang out enough (various factors).

I'm looking for four or five people to join me in an experiment. The idea is that we’d be paired with up to six mentors from /r/datingadvice, over time, helped to change both the belief system and set of corresponding actions that I believe keeps us alone.

This is a group mentoring project because I think groups are invaluable when trying to overcome challenges like this. Groups have deeper wisdom and often come up with better decisions than an individual would alone. Groups can also be much more motivating; not least because if you promise a group you’re going to do something it’s much more likely you’ll do it.

Once we’ve described ourselves and what we’re looking for we’ll be paired with our mentors. They’ll want to know more about us

Once the background work has been done, measurable steps to take towards our goal. The deadline helps us focus. The challenging but achievable steps develops our sense of self-determination. The measurable nature helps us understand we’re making progress. 

This is an action-orientated project, in order we understand that what went wrong is not due to something permanent and unchangeable about us or our luck. This will be an ongoing process because it’s likely we’ll encounter bumps along the way and we’ll need to be careful not to be catastrophic about them too.

We’ll need to be honest

I'm a marine biologist who doesn't get near enough work. I love being outdoors and camping, hate top 40's music...mostly. I also severely enjoy dancing like an idiot but I'm really shy about doing it in public. 

I play video games and consider myself pretty good at them but my best friend is way better. I like to keep current on world events, and even neighborly gossip. I cook like a mofo, though it shows in the fact that I'm a bit overweight. I love to BBQ, fry, sautee, slow cook, and pretty much any other way to turn raw materials into delicious dinner for everyone. 

I'm a pretty sensual person and love experiencing new things. I like long walks on a beautiful day. I'm happiest when I'm listening to good music while on a long drive to either somewhere or nowhere. 

A list of my favorites:

Music Artist: Ratatat

Album: Moon Safari by AIR

Beer: Magic Hat #9

Videogame: Fallout New Vegas

Book: Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut

Author: Douglas Adams

Movie: Mortal Kombat (I only picked this cause I like way too many movies and this is the one I've seen the most)

Color: Blue (though I am starting to like green a whole lot more)

T-shirt: My Peelander-Z mad tiger t-shirt

Superhero: The Hulk

Because of these things I've become quite socially awkward and don't know really how to talk to people unless they are too totally weird and out there. People who know me always find it weird when I say I'm a shy dude since I'm talkative and tend to go on but I am shy at the start. Even more so when I'm starting to get to know someone of the opposite sex

Right now my life is kinda not where I want it to be. I'm working a shit job while trying to figure out if I should go back to school and finish up my psych degree or maybe just start fresh again. I enjoy going out and having a good time. Whether its hiking, anacrhonox and the fallout series. Books right now don't really consist of much since I have a huge back log of books that Ive bought read half way and haven't finished. They mostly consist of fiction scifi and fantasy. Music Is also somewhere I tend to lag but I love all types except country. If you're like and worship the ground the bowie walks on I will love you forevers.

As for what im looking for? I'm looking for someone to start out with friends and then if there is something there, never will but but I'm me. Be open minded, enjoy the humor that life has to bring and lets rock and roll?

Hello gentlemen

I like to think that I'm well rounded when it comes to a hobbies - playing video games, gardening and working outdoors are a few of the major ones right now. Other things I like to do would be hiking, watching the occasional movie or TV show (Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and The Mindy Project are some of the few I'll watch), biking, the arts, music and live shows, and antiquing.

Things I don't like? Politics, those are fun to watch as well.

Currently I am unemployed; I worked in the aerospace industry and was laid off a few months ago. Since then

In the interests of honesty - I'm not in the best shape ever but I'm not obese - I'm working on losing weight by exercising, that's a bonus. :)

I'm looking for friends as much as I am a relationship

Oh and lastly, I don't like them really, I don't want to take care of your kids.  You must be an animal-lover, as I have a cat, a dog, and a horse and will always own animals. Please be clean. I don't care if you're an untidy person, as I am myself, sadly

One of my favourite quotes is by Tolstoy

I'm a pretty big guy (I could never be called slim, and you're probably about there.

I can't sleep unless I'm in total darkness

I have a love of exploring new places and learning new things all the time. I'm very open to trying new foods and learning lots of things about a person. I also enjoy basic hiking and scenic walks, so why not do so?
I have a continuously expanding list of things I like to do; not so much a bucket list, let's find something to do', list.

I love to read, some smooth jazz, and read. If I'm reading around other people- friends, family, strangers who don't know what they're getting into- I'll show them passages I like, or read out bits in various accents that may or may be completely wrong for the character. I have a huge collection of books, and particularly enjoy mysteries, detective novels

I like a lot of movies, thrillers, detective movies, and comedies. I love anything by Mel Brooks- bonus points if it includes Gene Wilder, too.

Musically, swing, classic rock and pop. Anything from before the mid-nineties, for the most part, though sometimes ill listen to something more recent if I can kind of persuade myself to.

What am I looking for? Ideally, and 18 or over, and we'll be just fine. I'm cool with whatever, though I would, ultimately, be looking at a relationship, whether long distance or otherwise.

I'm definitely more of an introvert, I just prefer interaction in small groups as opposed to large ones, and definitely prefer to spend the majority of my time alone or with only a few people.

So I'm just putting this in here because if you want someone to go to clubs/concerts/bars with on a regular basis, or talk for hours one on one, I'm your guy.

I'm athletic and outdoorsy, hiking, and rock climbing, although I hardly have at all since I've been in St. Louis, thanks to law school unfortunately. But if you're into any of that maybe you'd help get me back into gear, and if not it's all good.

Other than that I love discussing philosophy and politics (I'm in law school, and movies, and anything really. I'm not sure if there's anything I love more than cuddling up and watching a bizarre/strange/interesting movie, and kicking around our interpretations and theories afterwards.

I do a fair amount of computer gaming, LoL, etc). I'm not posting here to find gaming buddies, but it never hurts to mention it. If it's a common interest or you're just looking for someone to play these games or others with, let me know.

There’s nothing quite like the warmth of another. One of the things I’ve always wanted to do is curl up under a blanket outside and watch the stars through the night and talk until the sun comes up in the morning.

I really enjoyed going to college because it gave me a chance to meet new people and experience new things

My interests vary greatly; I enjoy being outdoors (camping, target shooting, hiking) , but I also enjoy going to museums and seeing shows at the theater. My favorite type of music is ska music, but I also have a fondness for jazz and random pop songs (like Call Me Maybe). I am also very big into acting; I spent four years in college as a part of an improv comedy troupe and I loved every minute of it.

I have a full-time job at a bookstore and on my free time I enjoy jogging/working out, playing video games and catching up with television. I like all sorts of music, from classical, ""oldies,"" indie, punk, soul, shows and karaoke. Museums and art exhibits can be fun! I enjoy looking around record stores and seeing what neat albums

Regarding the gaming: I enjoy shmups, own a Dreamcast and Xbox 360. I also have gotten back into anime and have watched a few current series. As for films, I love them all.

New account for this. I don't know if there are others out there with similar situations as mine, showing off good and hiding the bad. Doing that seems silly though. I don't want to false advertise. I am looking for a relationship but I'll need to go slow, it's been a while for me but I'm ready to get back up and try again.

I've recent'y moved to the area, and my own place if that's important to you. I'm a bit nerdy but more in the software and hardware sense. Girls that are a bit nerdy themselves or don't hate things that aren't 'cool' are pretty awesome in my book. Keeping an open mind is critical. I try to do this myself but am not always the best. I can cook *okay*, and am a pretty clean person. I do my work before I play and leave the best tasting food for last on my plate. I love winter and am a romantic. Coffee is the best addition to snow. Sometimes I worry more than I should; I'm also very sensitive. Having a same team mentality is important to me in a relationship. I'm fit but I don't look like the guys in 300. Being with a girl who takes care of her body is important to me, as I'll do the same myself. However, really skinny girls are a bit creepy sometimes. Three qualities I find to be really attractive in a woman are sincerity, patience, and being true to emotions. I'm pretty terrible at sports, I don't hate on those who do. Different types of art are pretty interesting to me; I tried painting once and it looked like something from a 1st grade class.

I'm by no means perfect, just together. If that makes sense. Someone who will let me help her when she needs it, and someone who will help me when I need help.

I understand that I'm not for everybody and that's okay. If this seems silly or too sappy for you that's okay as well

Musical Taste(s):

Favorite Books (Where do I begin...):
-One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Grapes of Wrath, and a crap load of other novels/books that would take me a while to list.

I don't even know why I'm posting this
What is there to tell about me ? Good question...

I guess I'm a 21 year-old guy who is sick and tired of being alone. And yes, extremely ugly (I assume at least) or totally nerdy. I just realized that I'm surrounded by a lot of (superficial)people who think that the important things in life are to befriend people to some extent, hang out with them for a while and then do trash talk about them behind their backs, as if it was the most ordinary thing in life. So I needed a break and enjoyed it. But I'm done with that now - that's why posting here I guess.

I really enjoy e-Sports like StarCraftII, watching movies, chillin out, jogging, smokin some pot sometimes and a good conversation. Additionally, reading some good Mangas (not that typical mainstream shit, so it rarely happens, or maybe I didn't search good enough?! So I guessed that there might be a person

Male
College Graduate



Working an IT position with a local company.

I am the prototypical nerd... I am an avid reader. I am a huge game player (video, etc.), mainly PC now a days, although I just got a 3DS. I love doing things outside also and other activities... hiking, soccer, football, volleyball, basketball, I will:) I love watching activities (such as sports) in addition to participating in them. 

I am a big fan of tv series

I play acoustic guitar and love music. I talk and text a lot. I am fairly shy in person.

Only ever had 1 girlfriend in my life

I can elaborate more on any points as requested. I will try many things.

Here's my boring story: My ex-girlfriend of just about three years broke up with me. I say just about because she actually broke up with me not even two weeks before our three year anniversary. Yes, it sucks being single. I no doubt have the sex drive of any 23 year old male but I’m also a very simple guy. I enjoy the simple pleasures like spending my Friday nights with my significant other cuddling under the blankies with a nice warm cup of hot cocoa and a movie playing through Netflix. In the two years I've been ForeverAlone I’ve only gone on two dates. The first date was unsuccessful. It was with a girl who I met on OKCupid and was more excited to meet me than I was her – need I say anymore?  My next date, whom I met through PlentyofFish wasn’t as unsuccessful and if you can call now having that person in my life as one of the best friends I’ve ever had then I don’t regret anything at all. Aside from that, online dating hasn’t really worked for me and meeting people in real life so far obviously hasn’t worked for me much either. Admittedly, I’m shy, but in no way socially awkward/inept. 
What really stings is seeing one of my friends not even be single for a month and already she has had more attention from guys in the time she’s been single (again, she has boobs, therefore it’s to be expected she gets more attention than a guy – still stings though, hence here I am hoping to receive a little love from my fellow Redditors :)

I'm going to school to be a preschool teacher. I moved away in january to FL for an internship with Disney, cuddle. I'm movie obsessed. I love to take trips into the city and just get lost. I think getting lost is really fun. I love caffeine so maybe if we hit it off any your close, some coffee? If not, maybe a skype chat from starbucks? :P

I am a 25 year old man looking for a long term relationship with a special female. I work in security for a living at a local distribution center. I have been there for 5 years, if anything at all. Personality wise I am a special kind of strange. Not the bad kind but the ""always keeps you entertained and on your toes"" kind.

I am looking to pick up new hobbies but I love video games, and just doing whatever tickles my fancy at the time. I love action and comedy movies but I will watch just about anything (even if its god awful, as these are where the most fun is had!) and for TV shows I am currently watching Dexter, The Walking Dead and will be starting Breaking Bad pretty soon. Music I will listen to anything but I find what I listen to the most are bands like Combichrist, Stratovarius, Grendel, Deathstars and sometimes 90's hits stations on Slacker radio (weird

I have no idea what I am looking for. Guess I will know when I find the right person. Just hoping they share the same love of games
