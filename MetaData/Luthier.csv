One time, I forgot to tell him to leave the original knobs on the guitar and not use the new ones because of the sentimental value of the guitar as a whole (I remembered this on my way to pick up my guitar). When I got to his shop, I found he had left the original knobs on without me even telling him to. He understood what the guitar meant to me without me even telling him. It may sound like a small, pointless thing but it meant the world to me that my Strat was that much more original to the one my dad gave me. From then on, no one else was allowed to work on my guitars.

He moved away some years ago and I went to see him once. I always swore I'd go back more often. Next time. Next time. Next time never came and I feel like an asshole. Pardon the rant fellow denizens of this subreddit. I just needed to share with you all the passing of a great guitar-man with great skill and great passion. I'm glad I knew him and the profession he leaves behind is that much worse off without him. He did what he loved and he loved what he did. I'm going to miss him.

I'm going to go check the neck relief on all my guitars now. RIP Eric.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/7RRn7) a before picture

**Things you'll need:**
Go out and buy these things. Home depot will have most of the stuff

* Your guitar (Like I said... idiot-proof)
* The highest grit sanding sponge you can find 
* Mask
* One can of spray primer
* 1 can of lacquer spray paint for each color you want
* 3 cans of lacquer clear  spray paint
* 3M perfect-it rubbing compound (gotta order this online)
* 3M perfect-it swirl mark remover (online as well)
* 600, 1500, etc... grit wet sandpaper
* 2""
* Exact-o knife
* 2x2 block of wood
* [Screw-on hook thingy](http://photo-dictionary.com/photofiles/list/6181/8142screw_hook.jpg)

**Things to know:** First and foremost, expect to see cracks in your finish. Don't paint outside, or somewhere where small particles float around (I made this mistake, and now my guitar has wood shavings embedded in it). Don't spray paint without a mask! And open a window for god sakes! Finally, don't paint while on fire. If you're on fire, you're doing it wrong.

**1. Disassemble your guitar:** Use a screwdriver to disassemble your guitar. Put the pieces in appropriately labeled zip-lock bags and store them somewhere. Make sure to label where each wire is connected. If your guitar's neck detaches

**2. Sanding the paint:** The layers of paint on your guitar are like so: paint-&gt;primer-&gt;wood grain finish-&gt;wood. Start sanding your guitar with the sanding sponge (use your mask). Once you see silver, your guitar will be smooth like Pootie Tang. If it's rough to the touch, you've sanded past the wood grain finish, and you'll have to paint on some more of your own finish (I didn't have to do this, so you're on your own here.) [Here's](http://imgur.com/Qjz2Q) mine halfway through sanding. Notice the silver primer on the edge of the red paint.

**3. Mask off the neck socket and binding:** So yea, you won't be able to reattach your neck exactly as it was before.

**4. Whip out the hook 'n stick:** Take your 2x2 stick and cut it to about arm's length. Screw in the large hook to one end. Screw on the other end to the guitar as if it were the neck. The purpose of this stick is to 1)  hang the guitar while it's drying

**5. Modify the wood:** If you're planning on putting in new hardware, but thankfully the knobs covered up my mistake.

**6. Learn the spraying method:** For the parts that involve spraying, giving the paint a rough texture. Start spraying away from the guitar, not while you're aiming at it. Make horizontal passes over the guitar, taking about 1 second per pass. Each pass should overlap half of the previous pass. If paint starts running, stop painting, let it dry a little, sand the run down, then the back/front. 

**7. Spray the primer:** Using the above spraying technique

**8. Spray the base coat:** Your base coat should be the lightest color you're using. If this is your only color, you'll barely be covering the guitar. You won't get the color you want until your 4th or 5th coat. Working slow like this is the best way to avoid runs. I didn't get a single run when I painted my guitar.)

**9. Mask your guitar and slice it:** Using the 2"" masking tape

**10. Spray the second color:** herp derp. This color should be your next darkest color. If this is your last color

**11. Tape up again

**12. Peel off the tape:** Now you can peel off all of the tape you put down (except for the tape in the neck socket). When peeling

**13. Spray ALL the clear paint!:** Herpin derpin. When you're done

**14. Agonizing Torture:** Now you have to let the guitar sit for 3 months. I know, you'll notice that the finish will take on the texture of whatever it's resting on, which is a terrible way to ruin your paint job. I read that Gibson lets their guitars sit for 6 months before they touch them, so you should feel lucky.

**15. Wet Sanding** Start wet sanding using a sanding block and your wet sandpaper. You'll notice that there are obvious bumps between your colors. This is because you caked on so many layers of paint.  Start with lower grits- your goal here is to get rid of the ridges. When you get to the higher grits, though, stop what you're doing, get another can of clear, and go back to step 13.

**16. Buffin':** Whip out the 3M buffing solution and a 100% cotton fabric (I used an old t-shirt). Apply a dab of solution to one section of the guitar and rub it in with the cotton. The harder you rub

**17. Reassemble and Enjoy:** In case you haven't noticed

I didn't take any pictures while I was spraying on coats of paint

**EDIT 1:** So some people were asking how I did my design specifically. When I was at step 9, spaced uniformly. This created a triangle pattern. If you look at the illusion, each cube is actually a hexagon. 6 Triangles make a hexagon... you see where I'm going with this.",,False,self,t5_2rxqu,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/qy2o9/cross_post_how_to_give_your_guitar_a_professional/

Needless to say I snagged it immediately, the electronics look nice, but I think the repair will be fine. 

The strings on it are brand spanking new elixirs so my theory is that they may have tried to go a guage too heavy for this neck.

I am looking at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc9xZJoZO9g for guidance

Update:
Guitar is now back with the original owners!

OK so the neck gluing seemed to work pretty well. I put the tuners and strings on to check stability

So I tried to put it in a case cause its raining out, she kept asking me ""how much"" she didn't understand I was just doing it to be nice, but she thanked me finally and said her husband would be thrilled. I told her just to let me know if she ever decided to throw it away again.

1350343051.0,11jeex,My scrappy short scale 4 string build,sitruss,23,6,17,"[Pics!](http://imgur.com/a/XtADO)

This is my second guitar and it's a headless design I came up with that was inspired by the reverse tuner setup on some Kramer guitars and basses. I made even more mistakes on this guitar than I did the first

- 23"" scale length
- 4 string headless design using a 4 string electric mandolin bridge and locking Grover tuners (pulled off my last guitar) with 3/8"" string to string spacing
- Neck has no truss rod
- Body made of mahogany and canary
- 1 Dragonfire hot rails pickup
- was originally going to be a neck-through made from a tin lunchbox but the material was extremely hard and frustrating to work with so I redesigned it as a bolt-on.
- electronics plates were hand cut and polished from aluminum sheet
- it uses a bolt for a nut (who what what?)
- right now it has the middle 4 strings of the guitar

I wanted to make a gift for a friend and I had been jonesing to see if I could make building a guitar easier than last time with what I learned from the first go around. I settled on a simple 4 string design inspired by cigar boxes. Originally the body was going to be a Darth Vader lunch box (he's a Star Wars fan) but I found it to be a difficult and flimsy material to work with and after devising and building a whole hidden tuner design decided to abandon it for a bolt-on with a wood body instead.

In spite of the flaws I learned even more this time around and the result is 10x more playable and superbly balanced thanks to the headless design.

Flaws:

- Spent weeks working on a design for mounting the guitar to a lunchbox which ultimately was completely scrapped
- Had to spend forever filing frets because once again they went in very unlevel (which I now attribute to using a rubber mallet instead of an arbor or deadblow hammer)
- Had to cut the mounting hole tab off one tuner to fit it on the guitar with the others (I measured the holes with another set of tuners that I eventually decided were too cheap to trust)
- Did a quick fix finish for the body (2 coats of stain/poly brushed on)
- Routing the strings through the body and around the backside to the tuning pegs made for a huge increase in tension behind the bridge with my initial design you see in the photos (I had small posts that routed the strings like a tree but later widened the channel and removed them) which made the guitar essentially untunable without breaking strings
- Although I lined the neck up flush while creating the body pocket
- When screwing the bridge on
- The tuners act a bit funny
- Because I'm an idiot I hand drilled the inlay holes and as such they ended up crooked looking

I'm sure there are others but you get the idea. On the other hand:

- It plays well. The action is a little higher than I'd like
- It sounds pretty good! The pickup is good sounding and I learned from my last guitar that they are not arbitrarily placed (the first one has it by the bridge and sounds very nasal) so I picked a sweet spot closer to the neck position. It takes cleans and distortion nicely.
- It is perfectly balanced. One of the biggest lessons I learned with my last guitar is how important balance is to an instrument. I completely ignored that fact with the first and it was nearly unplayable from the neck dive it had from it's tiny body and heavy thick maple neck (not to mention odd shape). That was the main reason I chose a headless design this time around and I don't regret it at all
- It is comfortable to hold. I got the contours better this time around (no room for any on the last guitar). It's a small instrument as you can see in my last comparison pic

1361291401.0,18ton9,I am fixing up an old acoustic guitar. Is this the right place for me to be? [x-posted from r/guitar],cloudmerchant,18,2,31,"Hi guys. I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong section. I'm fixing up an old acoustic that someone gave me and I wondered if there was anyone here who would be willing to answer a few questions along the way.

A little bit about the guitar:

It appears to be a classical guitar

The thing is

It's a natural finish with (what I assume is) an ebony fretboard. The inside of this guitar is mint, but I do know a thing or two about furniture and the wood looks and feels sound.

Why I'm fixing it up:

My current guitar is a roundback Ovation and, frankly, it's more of a family heirloom than an instrument.

My hope is that I can get this little guitar fixed and retire the Ovation.

What I need:

**I have to glue the neck.** It's supported by an inaccessible rod

**I need to replace the machine heads.** I found [these guys](http://www.dhgate.com/2pcs-set-guitar-accessories-gilding-classical/p-ff808081368687a601369b254d593eca.html#s1-6-null) for super cheap, suggestions?

**I am thinking about replacing the nut.** It's probably the original plastic version and I'd prefer bone - is there any real difference or did I get bonked by my last luthier? There's no saddle on this thing. Or maybe it's a metal saddle? The strings terminate into a metal piece [that looks a bit like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Stella_In_Case.jpg/800px-Stella_In_Case.jpg) and I have no idea what it's called. **Edit:** Thanks to u/jooes I now know the metal bit is a called a tailpiece. I apologize for my idiocy!

I can post some photos if you guys want to see what I'm dealing with.

I don't know what else you might like to know but I appreciate any and all feedback

Thanks!

**EDIT** In lieu of photos of my actual guitar, which are very similar to mine. The body shape is also pretty close, but mine has some fancy line work around the hole and a pick guard. Is this a parlor guitar, not a classical?

First
I am learning to become a science/physics teacher. My college gave me the task of interviewing someone who has a profession that somehow has something to do with physics (specifically sound). 

I would greatly appreciate it if you could answer me the following questions. It doesn't have to be an essay

* Why did you choose this profession?
* What is your favourite part about your job?
* And what is your least favourite?
* What education did you take?
* What other educations could you take from there? what kind of impact would that have on your career
* What part of your (high-school) physics class do you still use in everyday life?

this information will be used to make teaching material to make young students understand better what professions they can practice with a career in physics. 

Also
I know I am asking a lot of you

Started with an all-parts body ($60 second) and decided to do the coloring with orange kool-aid. For those who are interested:
- 11 packs orange kool-aid
- 1 liter water
- 1/3 cup vinegar

Finished the body with minwax tung oil finish. 

For the neck I decided to try and go with a used squier tele neck. (I may decide to replace this though. 

Pickups are [GFS Fatbody](http://www.guitarfetish.com/Alnico-Fatbody-Oversized-Polepiece-Tele-Bridge-Pickup_p_75.html).

Got the electronics working on the third try (turns out not everyone on the internet agrees where the capacitor should go)

**Here's where I could use some help:**
Once I finished and put the strings on I found that the high e is almost at the egde of the fretboard at the high end. [pic](http://i.imgur.com/YiILS.jpg)

I do intend to take it to a luthier for a proper set up regardless but I wanted to see if it was something I could sort myself as the whole point of doing this project was the learning.

I figured it could be a couple of things:
1) **[the bridge is on a bit crooked](http://i.imgur.com/KpwUZ.jpg)**. This is something I plan to fix soon anyway (I am ordering a different bridge as the one I purchased seems a little too short) but I am wondering if it could be the cause.

2) **The neck could be on a bit crooked**: It took me 3 tries to get the neck to sit straight. I don't see it but it could still be a little off. It could also be because it is a used neck that it has a twist or something I don't see with my untrained eye. If it is a twist I would be fine with just getting a different neck.

Oddly enough

Thanks for any insights!

**update** :It seems the solution was a crooked neck.

Here is the neck [after adjustment](http://i.imgur.com/M2ibs.jpg) and the bridge is [much straighter as well](http://imgur.com/a/kWTQk#30).

 - a new logo (does anyone have any ideas?  I tried some things out a while back
 - content - always.  We're not hurting for it - we get new postings all the time - but more is always better
 - more focus on acoustic instruments - violins, and it would be nice to see more acoustic instruments
 - perhaps creating some strategic partnerships with other relevant subreddits, or others (I have tried with /r/guitar, /r/bass, and /r/telecaster, and I've made postings there to let people know we exist, but other suggestions would be helpful)

1351957374.0,12kf8k,I am '3D Printing' an Electric Guitar,Yeah-BUDDY,20,5,28,"As the title suggests

I guess most people know that 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing is, but it means that there are virtually no limitations when designing the product. A great example of 3d printing is shown in [this video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArGg3fdqLj4), where a 3D gear cube can be printed *fully assembled and working*! (Ok, so the video shows a cube made in separate parts then assembled after, but it can be done in one step).

The AM technique people associate with 3D printing is done in a way similar to a inkjet printer where a print head moves in a 3d space and slowly builds a model from the base up. This has geometry limitations, and leaves the rest of the layer of powder alone. Then it spreads another layer of powder o top and repeats the lasering process. [Here is a good example of the sintering process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VImKhUD-8hk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=32s)

So, but [Olaf Diegel in New Zealand is making some pretty incredible guitars]( http://www.odd.org.nz/guitars.html) in the same method as I will be.

The guitar body is printed in one piece, this could be printed in plastic and have the right stiffness and tonal qualities. The material used for laser sintering is almost always Nylon12, a white plastic polymer with great qualities for sintering and also for life as a used product. To make it visually more attractive it can be dyed with a simple nylon clothes dye, but this takes a lot of trial and error to get right.

So why would you go to all the hassle of making this when a wooden guitar does the job fine? There are some things that the wooden guitars will always be best for - the AM guitar will have far less sustain

Possibly the idea I am most enthusiastic about is printing the body in other materials. I am using a Nylon12 plastic

A bit about me: I wanted to learn how to play guitar a few years ago, I made a Maple Tele which came out even more beautiful than the first.

I also need to carve the neck pocket, finish all the smaller drilling for the bridge, backplate, etc.  I need to knock out the current nut and replace it with a lefty one. Then I need to glue the top to the body, and hopefully fit it together and hope I haven't totally boned routing the pickup cavities.

I have *zero* idea how to proceed from here.  Moreso

1347808099.0,zz123,Difficult guitar - what are my options?,Ikarian,16,1,12,"Hi folks-

A while back, there's no denying that).  I managed to play one at my local GC for about 5 minutes, and didn't really have any complaints with it, so I mentioned to my wife that it was a model I was thinking of buying.

My wife ended up getting me one for my birthday, everything about it is great.  Until you pick it up to play it.

Now, I also have an older Fender dreadnought that is what I consider to be a little more in line with what an acoustic should feel like in terms of playability.  It's not the greatest guitar in the world, but when you finger a chord correctly, it sounds the notes (with a little fret buzz here and there).

The Ibanez is an absolute bear to play.  I have to *really* clamp down on the strings to get them to sound, this thing is kind of a bitch to play.  It sucks because if it played anything like my Fender acoustic, it would easily be my favorite guitar.

I decided to play it a while before I took it in to get it set up for the first time (about the life of the set of strings on it now, so whereas my electric has an adjustable bridge, the Ibanez does not.  I'm not expert, but I feel like maybe the frets on this thing are not high enough, which is what makes it hard to finger a note.  Right now, I have Elixir strings in an .11 gauge, and the action feels very stiff.   What should I ask to have done in order to make the guitar easier to play?

Thanks in advance for any advice.",self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/zz123/difficult_guitar_what_are_my_options/

Yes, and I really wasn't interested in trying to make a new one and screwing up the holes for the pickups again (This is where forms are *really* important), so I duct-taped it together and used white glue to attach the aluminum foil. I was going for an ironic elementary school arts and crafts look, I suppose. 

Here's the headstock:

The neck was off of a Peavy EXP that a music store sold me - not sure what happened to the rest of the instrument. The holes for the tuners were too big for the tuners I'd already bought, that's the cause of the white stuff around the tuners - the vapour from the glue reacted with the plastic.

The neck pocket was hard - I should have made a form, I had a lot of the stuff on hand) so that the neck fits in place properly.

You can see how the body doesn't quite fit the neck.

You know, put it on something soft so you don't gouge the other side (you can see what I'm talking about, I'm sure). I lost the cover I made (Arborite!) for the wiring cavity a while ago, and since I don't actually play this guitar I haven't felt like replacing it. 
If I were doing this again

People, had to move the bridge a bunch of times, and now it's an ordeal to change the strings

Blurry close-up of the electronics cavity:

The pickups are Burns Tri-Sonic replicas - clones of the ones Brian May used on his homebuilt guitar. I was a huge Queen fan when I built this, and three phase switches. It's a brilliant wiring combination and it gives you such a wide variety of sounds - I don't know why it's not in more guitars.

Is it worth investing in a large drum sander to ensure uniform thickness of the back

Next, why isn't the inside coated in something as well?

I'm considering a Les Paul build with a few different takes to ease the construction and change up the feel of the guitar. I'm kind of a sucker for trying new things and I also don't have much in the way of a proper woodworking space or a ton of specialized tools to work with so I'm thinking about making my Les Paul with the following differences:

* Flat-top - No carving in the top exept for...
* Body contours - Pretty much the same as on a strat (Tummy-cut and arm contour) but I'll need to figure out the best placement for the tummy-cut later.
* Straight neck
* String-thru tail with a recessed tune-o-matic bridge much like some of [Godin's Signature series](http://www.godinguitars.com/godinlgxsap.htm) guitars
* Possibly maintain the angled headstock or go with a straight head if possible but that's one thing I need some feedback on.
* Deeper cutaway for better access to the higher frets and a slightly different look. I don't like the [ESP Eclipse](http://www.espguitars.com/guitars/esp-standard/eclipse2.html) cutaway so it would be more rounded like on a [regular LP](http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-Custom/50th-Anniversary-1959-Les-Paul-Standard.aspx)

And that's about it.

The body is solid mahogany

The neck would be a set-neck with mahogany and a rosewood fretboard.

I need thoughts on the neck

I have no idea if the straight headstock on the guitar is possible. I see some woodworking issues if I need to have an angle on the headstock since I don't have much mahogany to work with and no experience in making an angled headstock. If it's necessary to have one I can work with what I have but I'd like to see how it would turn out with a straight one if it would be logistically possible without destroying the stability of intonation or the strength of the head itself.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/7jzCz.jpg) is the back being glued to the sides. This is the second attempt at gluing on the back. The first go around, it turned out flat despite the rake that had been planed into the sides and kerfing. Clamped to the bottom board, the back will curve to fit the rake. Unfortunately, [this](http://i.imgur.com/4DS56.jpg) happened. The center seam support fit fine on a dry run, but after applying the glue and clamping, the end got caught up on the neck block and was glued firmly to it, with a nice gap in between the back and the neck block.

I've gotten pretty handy with this thing, at least as far as estimating how much it'll take off in a pass, and I nailed it at .0935"" (probably the first time I've gotten it just right).

I came into a pretty nice telecaster body ""replacement"" so I'm jumping into my first build.  Have some basic DIY and woodworking know-how but don't have the space or money to get invested in a complicated set-up.

I have a mahogany thinline telecaster body with a sweet 5A curly maple top.  I'm hoping to grab some transtint dyes and do a basic two-tone sunburst but I'm still uncertain about what the plan is before/after that.  I was leaning towards doing the tru-oil ""build up/grain fill/buff"" method I've used before on a table but I want to make sure I do what a pretty sweet looking body deserves.

Does the Tru-Oil grain fill method work with multiple shades of wood?  What's the finish you recommend to first-timers to balance quality vs. foolproof-ness?  What have you used on your guitars?  Any and all wisdom is appreciated.

The cuts aren't perfect and as such, as long as someone who knows what they're doing takes the project on.

As you can see, hardware selected and routed for, controls routed, truss rod put in, head shaped and drilled for tuning pegs. You can also see that there are a few things I mucked up; the truss rod channel being the biggest one. I don't think it would affect it too much, and a piece of wood could easily be glued in to fill the router slip.

While it was in my closet, but aside from smelling like gun cleaner, I don't see how it would affect it much.

My first kit came last week - [the poplar telecaster from guitarfetish.com](http://www.guitarfetish.com/High-Quality-Solid-Poplar-Telecaster-Style-Kit-complete_p_1196.html)

It's pretty much there already, instead of the rosewood - I know most people would love that, but I kind of wish I had the rosewood...  I had an idea in my head of how it would look, and now it's going to look different...

Before I talk too much, and decided I wanted to do more than just do music, but be able to build guitars as well.  I have a dream I'll be able to become a real luthier at some point, but that seems more fantasy than anything.

My plan for this kit is, and start adding to it immediately.  Version 1 will be almost completely stock, except that a push-pull pot will swap out the neck pickup with a piezo I will mount under the bridge.

Finish will be bright red, it shall be named the macgyvercaster.  I ordered a product called ColorFX, but the post office is holding it ransom.  It's been over a week, and it hasn't left the post office in Saskatoon yet.  It might as well be on the moon.  :(

First upgrade will be to replace the pickups - both of them.  Bridge will be a GFS pro-series 63 neck pickup, hooked up to a push-pull pot.  It will be split in the normal position, and pulling the pot up will change it to humbucker mode - this way, by default, it will play like a normal tele, but pulling the pots will put it into weirdo mode.

Next upgrades will be locking tuners, though those are in no particular order.

The plan is built it as stock (ish), tearing down, and rebuilding guitars.  This is really an experimental piece for me.

Other ideas

EDIT:  Right, more like a spearhead.  I've shaved down the neck, too - it was REALLY beefy when I first got it, now it's just a little thicker than my LP.  I'm planning on shaving it down a bit more before I'm done with it, but it's pretty good.  Will post pics when I get a chance.

* In the middle position

1. I thought about first building a cheap kit guitar, doing electronics, setting up the guitar, etc. The kits seems quite easy when it comes to the assembly, but the finishing is definitely a skillset I have yet to acquire.

2. Second step for me would be to make a new body from scratch for one of my guitars. This will allow me to practice some more advanced woodworking. I might repeat this step if I'm not satisfied with the result.

3. Next up: neck time. I want to make a new bolt-on neck for the body I made in step 2. Getting the fretwork and the contour right is the part that scares me. I'll repeat this step until I'm satisfied with the neck I can make. 

4. Use acquired skills to make set neck and neck-through-body guitars around until skills are perfected. Gradually acquire skills to do nice inlays, etc.

For now I'm going to put off building acoustic guitars

My main questions are:

1. Is this progression realistic?

2. How many guitars do you generally have to build before you can produce something that plays well?",self,t5_2rxqu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/svdff/need_advice_getting_into_guitar_building/

1332367890.0,r7eub,Guys? I want to build a guitar but I could use your help on a few things,EndlessOcean,7,1,18,"Gentlemen

Recently

But I have a few preliminary questions about ideas I have that I could use an expert opinion on. I did do a search

So

I want to build some kind of double cut build, 2 x HB, string-thru with a tuneomatic bridge and a bolt on neck. I figured the bolt on would be easier to rout and for a noob to handle. I'd also like to rear-rout it, but we'll see how adventurous I feel once I get to that point.

But here's the concerns. There's a lumber yard getting rid of a lot of offcuts of about 11 different species of hardwood, maple, beech, mahogany, cedar... usual stuff, and the pieces are all over 18"", planed surfaces and assorted widths. I asked him if he could assemble me a bundle comprising all different species and all over a certain length and depth sufficient for guitar building.

The plan is to maybe end up with a 10 piece block of all different woods

It'll most likely be face grain to face grain

For the bridge: I presume there's nothing wrong with having a tuneomatic at 25"" scale, and 12th to bridge is 12.5"", but, I might be wrong there too. I don't want to use a Fender style bridge as TOMs kick ass. I know there's an angling issue with the TOM alignment, and I also know Warmoth have a $15 option to change the angle of the neck pocket when a TOM is selected which is other stuff I have to consider at some point down the line.

Everything else is to be ascertained

Advice and comments welcome :),oiliver,9,5,4,"Over the last few months I have immersed myself in resources about creating guitars; the materials and techniques involved, looks, so to me it was a logical progression to extend my learning by making my own guitar.
But I am a broke-ass student, let alone properly. So I decided that to save on costs, and to maximise the learning experience I would do as much as I possibly could myself. So off I went, and started to build a guitar!  
I am getting into the later half of my build (I have gone for my own unique/bizzare travel-electric form) and I figure I might as well show you all, and maybe encourage some of you other complete novices out there to give making your own guitar from scratch a go! It is so rewarding, and despite being time consuming, it feels like time well spent. I know I have not created anything special in the technical/craft sense, but it is special to me.

[Here is the album with some work in progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/bNWau)  (Some of the photos are atrocious quality; taken on the fly with my ipod as I work). The body and (currently oversized) headstock are red alder, and it is pretty darn hard! All the wood actually came from my property, cut by my own two hands.

So impulse buy from that link posted in r/guitar last month of that guitar part supplier going out of business sale.  I bought a body and a neck thinking since it was so cheap I can try out putting a guitar together and if i fuck it up it was only $60.  I have a ton of extra parts: pick ups, tuning machines that have come from upgrading things from my other guitars all I needed to buy was a bridge and a nut.  I have not purchased the bridge yet but I was thinking [this](http://www.fullcontacthardware.com/fch-strat-tremolo.htm).  

So here I get body and neck opened up and Im looking at the body... The body was given the number 3 off a list of 1-5 different ratings, so before I start comparing I thought I would ask questions.  My questions are stated somewhat in the picture album but here they are:


* The neck's nut slot is 4 cm (edit thanks georgetd) wide, thickness and depth.  Should I have bought a blank nut and filed my own length and string notches?  I bought a graphite nut for a fender it was only $6...

* Once I started measuring to make sure I buy the right size bridge

* Does the bridge cavity need to be cut wider to the left?  I think the bridge post holes are cut right

I have a carpenter father in law who has every tool and measuring device in his shop.  We have always talked about trying to build a guitar, I look at this as a learning experience, even if I have to scrap the whole fucking thing.

Should the metal guitar have a wooden neck or should I attempt to form a neck from sheet metal(cheap) or even have one cnc'd from a aluminum block(very expensive).

Well I'm fixing her up in a few ways to make her a unique guitar.  I'm not making it necessarily into a Stratocaster, I figure that would help the ""singing"" a lot, and if needed, I'll replace the rest of the electronics too.  Finally, what I think is the most bold part, I'm ripping out all the frets and making a fretless guitar. I have no idea how I'm going to do that yet.

First thing's first. I already disconnected everything from the body.  I figured I would sand off some of the paint and make sure the actual wood wasn't cracked and it was just whatever was on top.  Luckily the wood wasn't cracked, kind of brownish, hard stuff covered the entire guitar. I thought this wouldn't be a problem but after half an hour of sanding, I realized how thick this stuff was.  I knew it would take weeks of sanding to get it all off so I said ""fuck it"" and got out my belt sander.  I know this probably wasn't the best idea but I figured it wouldn't be that much to get a new body if I really had to.  Now, I tried to keep the original shape as in tact as I could but some of the corners would not allow me to keep it perfect. Luckily everything sanded out smooth and round so the body may not be exact dimensions anymore, but I'll see if that effects it in the end.

Now here's the question for the body, I'll put a few layers of clear coat on it to prevent moisture and wearing of the pages.  Now is this a good idea? I have no idea if sticking it directly to the wood will work or not. Also is clear coat my best option? As for the second question, there is really weird paint in the holes were the electronics go.  It's a lot duller than the outside and is spiky. Do I want to strip this stuff out? What is it exactly?

The second part is easy, I can go up to $100.

And the last one, but everyone has a different way to fill the fret holes. I've heard of people doing epoxy, using thin wood strips and sanding it even, I've also heard of people putting metal or glass over the fretboard, eliminating the problem entirely.  What would be the best approach to the soon to be empty slots on my neck?  Also, what is a good way to grind the nut down to lower the action with tools that basically everyone has?

That's all I can think of.  If I can think of anything else I'll ask,,False,self,t5_2rxqu,False,,True

1.  Since the base plate won't be contacting any metal from the pickup (the pickup is epoxy potted) do I still need to connect it to ground or is that unnecessary?  Is the nickel/silver baseplate going to change the tone even if it's not making contact with the magnet or coil?

Recently, the wood has started to get white in the grains (drying up?) and the frets almost look like they're rising up from the fretboard (by about 0.25 - 0.5 mil) at their centres, followed by small hairline cracks in the binding at the fret positions much like [this image](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2047/2197800549_bd471c7eeb_z.jpg?zz=1) but only adjacent to the frets. 

I only spent £200 on this guitar so I don't want to go for a full fret dress and there are no dead notes. But it means a lot to me and I don't want it to die in two years because I didn't do anything now. Would it be acceptable to secure it on a workbench and tap the frets back in with a rubber hammer as well as oiling the fretboard with lemon oil?

Secondly I have a superstrat I built with a neck I bought from stewmac. I set the neck up to be pretty straight and again got a lovely action on it but it has 2 dead frets (7th and 15th if I remember correctly) on the high e and b strings which dont really improve without a completely unplayable action. I guess I have no choice but to take this one in as I dont have the correct tools for fret levelling.

I've seen a couple different ways to go about making the neck

1) Cut a single piece neck toward the nut at a 15 degree downward angle, however, is it leaves a weaker joint behind the nut.

2) After watching Ben of Crimson Guitars on his Youtube channel, repeats 3x and laminates. What I like about this is you are able to get what I think would be a stronger neck due to the fact that you're not using a single piece, but you're using possibly 3 different grain directions to control and reduce future twist or warp. Another thing I like about this method is a volute can easily be incorporated behind the nut, strengthening a notoriously weak point on the guitar's neck. The only real drawback is the headstock will have end grain on the surface, which will weaken it in the event of a fall. This can be remedied with a headstock top laminate(no veneer). 

So I've already started method 1 on the least desirable end of the 1x6x8' maple board I bought

This is meant to be a telecaster style neck.  It is one piece flat sawn Maple with Jarrah ""skunk stripe.  I used a ""hotrod"" truss rod.

I am wondering how many ""sessions"" of french polishing I should do.  I am currently using 2 lb cut of blond dewaxed shellac flakes in denatured ethanol.  I go over each area maybe 10-20 strokes with the rubber each session.

I am planning to make future necks of better quality improving on the mistakes I have leaned with this one.  such as using quarter sawn maple instead of flat sawn and probably adding fingerboard markers before the shellacking.

1. How would I go about repairing the cracks in a way that wouldn't ruin the appearance or sound of the finished instrument? I've read on other sites and they've suggested using CA glue. Will this suffice? Are there any other (better) options? How big of a mistake have I made waiting this long in the process to attempt repair? Images are attached at the end of the post.

2. I also made a ""cheese board"" from a smaller slab of the same tree three years ago

3. How difficult are inlays to do? I was thinking of using them to cover the cracks if the repair didn't look very nice.

4. Could a cheap old soldering iron be used to burn a logo into the headstock after the neck is bought/constructed?

The new pickups came with machine type screws and also springs

My first thought was to just install the new pickups by putting the wood screws through the holes in the new pickups and then putting the spring between the pickup and the wood.  This is where I ran into a problem.

The screws are a little too big for the holes, it gets stuck.

My question is.  Am I doing this right?  Should I drill a hole the size of the screw into these existing holes (aka make them a little bit bigger) and then proceed?  I just wanted the opinion of someone more experienced before I proceed with this type of operation since I don't want to ruin anything.  Also

I also had them do a general tune up while they had it with a set of .012-.052 flatwounds. I've been playing flatwounds for the past 2 years and would like to give roundwounds another try. It would be the same gauge


    Flatwounds:

Will this lower tension affect the neck/truss rod? It shouldn't affect action since it's the same gauge... I've done truss rod adjustments on my cheap Strat, I don't have the proper tool, nor do I want to experiment with an expensive guitar.


As a point of comparison

I adopted this old, but not major repairs, so this will be a learning project as well.

The first major hurdle has been resetting the neck, so the neck was bent forward enough that the action was over half inch above the 12th fret. 

I have since carefully removed the neck, i have a steam kit to loosen the glue).

First issue is that the bridge end of the neck has an ever so slight curve upward from sitting in a bad position so long

Second issue is that it looks like the truss nut was wound all the way off, it becomes pretty resistant quickly, and doesn't seem to have any effect on the neck.  Of course I'm leery of forcing it beyond where reistance is first met. Is there anything else I can try, or am I left with no choice but to remove the fretboard and see if I can fix or replace the truss?

I'm on a very tight budget (3 kids!) so please keep this in mind. If needs be I can post pics if it helps.

I have a Les Paul that currently has a push pull volume and tone pot for the neck pickup. I have the volume wired for a coil tap on the neck pickup but is it possible to use the tone pot to wire the bridge pickup for a coil tap? I'm using [this website as a guide](http://www.guitarelectronics.com/product/WD2HH3T22_02/Guitar-Wiring-Diagram-2-Humbuckers3-Way-Toggle-Switch2-Volumes2-TonesIndividual-Coil-Taps.html) and I've managed to wire the neck pickup with a coil tap on the volume successfully but I was just wondering how I'd go about wiring the bridge coil tap to the neck tone pot?

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you Cactusbiter &amp; Zalamander! Just wired everything up and it works like a charm!

I hate just sitting on the design so I've decided to post my rough specs on here. If any of you talented ladies/gentlemen are interested in building it you have my full support in doing so. As i said before I hate sitting on the design and would just love to see it become a real thing.
