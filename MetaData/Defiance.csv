1365511236.0,1bzhpj,So you want to mod your gun? Welcome to modding 101,ThatFacelessMan,121,18,56,"The modding process is essential to effective weapon use. With mods a decent gun can be good

That being said, and at least 100 EGO rating. Access to the Salvage Matrix is unlocked prior to 100 ER, but at 100 ER you should be able to start adding additional mod slots to weapons. 

First let's start with where the salvage matrix is:
[Right here](http://i.imgur.com/dwAtalV)

There is no hotkey to immediately take you to it, as that can make a difference to your modding experience, but we'll cover that in a minute.

Welcome to the [Salvage Matrix!](http://i.imgur.com/Zy7L0q7)

In it you select a weapon

In order:

White - 250

Green - 500

Blue - 750

Purple - 1000

Orange - 1250

You should be doing this with almost any weapon, and an ark hunter flush with ark salvage can buy keycodes at lockboxes, and potentially get even better guns to work with! 

So now you've got a gun

[Looking good!](http://i.imgur.com/bEsotL4)

But you realize that maybe you don't really want to mod that pistol. You're going to scrap it

[Oooooh

So you can see what a gun with a mod already attached looks like. See how the icon for barrel is lit up

Well lets load that bad boy into the salvage matrix!

[Uh oh](http://i.imgur.com/vvCWgql)

Whoops! That's right

There we go! [Much better](http://i.imgur.com/2Hl58io)

Notice that there are now options to remove or retrieve the mods currently equipped on the weapon. Removing the mods destroys all mods that are attached to the weapon

I mentioned that cost was a factor previously. To simply attach a mod

[Remove mod: 285 ark scrap

[Retrieve mod: 5

[Add mod slot: 11

The cost for each weapon is dependant on it's EGO rating. The lower it is, for each mod slot you add, the cost doubles. It does not look like removing or retrieving goes up in price with repetition, so those costs are totally dependant on the ER of the weapon.

So yeah

So that's how you navigate the salvage matrix. But what about the actual mods? There are four mod slots, magazine, and scope. They follow the same color scheme for rarity, but also have the additional marker of being named with a roman numeral, I-V to denote their rarity level as well. 

There's a breakdown of all the types and their in game names here: http://www.ign.com/wikis/defiance/Modifications

You get mods from side quests, and rampages. They are also available from some vendors on sale, but there are a few vendors that deal exclusively in mods, such as Iron Demon Ranch, Headlands Transport and Cronkhite Station, and the faction vendors of Toolworks, VBI, and Echelon have a random mod from a synergy set for sale.

A synergy set? Yep

Synergy sets are a set of bonuses that all have something in common, the more bonuses from the set appear.

Let's take a look!

Here's my [baby](http://i.imgur.com/dgXM5ni)

She's a faction Frontier SAW from Toolworks, in that they can have their own stats as well. So an Extended Magazine III mod would have a x1.5 magazine, and could have any synergy set on it as well, so you're getting double the bonuses when using synergies. 

As you can see Prepared deals with ammo regeneration, or for builds looking for increased melee damage, like Blur!

So what are the other synergies, VBI, and Soleptor all have two types available, and Paradise and Echelon each have one. They're on purple or higher weapons, and it's also possible to find them, very rarely out in the world or through lock boxes. The odds of you finding a synergy weapon increases as your ER increases. 

You can also buy synergy mods from the faction vendors

So what are the synergies?

There are more synergies out there

1366401440.0,1cp1nd,Comprehensive Suggestion List,ManaPot,108,17,43,"Here is a list of ideas that I think should be added / fixed in Defiance.

Post on the official forums: http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?44223-Comprehensive-Suggestion-List

* **Whisper button** - Add a button in the friends list and clan list that you can click to initiate a whisper to that person. A lot of people have oddly named characters and it makes it hard to keep typing their name over and over when you have multiple conversations going on.

* **Replying to a whisper** - When you type */r* have it automatically fill in that person's name (Replying to Bob would change */r* to */w Bob*). This way if somebody else whispers you while you are typing a message

* **Toggle chat** - Make it so you can toggle that chat to stay up permanently (not fade out). I miss a lot of messages due to how quickly they disappear off the screen. I know that I can scroll up

* **Resize chat** - Having the ability to resize chat would be nice too. I play on PC at 1920x1080

* **Get rid of the salvage screen** - It is un-needed and makes things take longer than needed. Move it all to the inventory screen and add the buttons there. When you click on an item name, Add Mod Slot, Remove Mods, etc). The inventory screen is basically useless as it is right now, I never go to it.

* **Quick Menu -&gt; Remove Friend** - Get rid of this. I can't tell you have many times I've accidentally removed friends while using the quick menu. It's not needed here

* **Friends list** - Sort the friends list in alphabetical order. The OCD side of me goes crazy when looking for someone. Online in ABC order

* **Clan list** - Make it so online clan members are at the top of the list

* **Empty Loadout** - Give us the option to click a button and empty an entire loadout. It's really annoying not being able to attach mods or salvage / vendor items because it's equiped on a loadout I never use. I use my main loadout 95% of the time

* **Banks / storage** - Give us access to a storage locker. Even if they share the same inventory space, having to take time and navigate through things.

* **Map -&gt; Teleport Group** - Allow me to double-click a group member on the map and teleport to them like Fast Travel does. I often look at where my other group members are

* **Map -&gt; Waypoints** - Let my group members see my waypoints. This would help when trying to tell them where to go. Each person's waypoint is a different color and when you mouse-over it

* **Store -&gt; Lockboxes** - Adjust the cost of lockboxes from the Defiance Store. Nobody is going to pay $1.50 (T2 lockbox) for 2 green items they're just going to salvage. I'm not asking to make it ""pay to win""

* **Remove a single mod** - Why can't I just remove one mod from my gun? I don't want to remove all four of them when I need to upgrade a single mod. Let me remove one at a time if I want

* **Character customization** - A LOT of us had no idea we could customize our characters so much. The options are hard to notice at the moment. Put a ""barber shop"" type feature in the game where we can pay Scrip to change our character's appearance.

* **Different vehicles** - Some new vehicles would be nice. We basically have 4 different looks at the moment. I'm not asking for different vehicle types, people will work for / buy them.

* **Vehicles -&gt; Reverse** - If you quickly tap ""D"" (on PC) to go in reverse

* **Fullscreen windowed mode** - Please.

* **Nameplates** - Allow me to set it so the nameplates are always shown. At the moment

* **Clan -&gt; Founder** - Add a confirmation box when promoting somebody to the clan founder. I wanted to see how many ranks there are in the clan, just when promoting someone to founder.

* **More people per server** - Increase the amount of people on each server. I know that each game platform is one giant server

* **Ending perks** - Why is this even an option? Sometimes I double-click 1 on accident

* **""Lock"" items** - Have the ability to lock items so they aren't able to be sold or salvaged. - Credit: /u/verugan

* **Healing** - Get rid of that screen effect when somebody is healing you. This is **very** disruptive in PvP. I'm constantly thinking I'm getting shot at

* **Breakable objects** - For the love of God

* **Offline invites** - Let us send friend requests and clan invites when the other player is offline.

* **Rename character** - Be able to purchase a character name change through the Defiance Store for $5 worth of Bits.

* **Colorblind support** - Help out our friends who have trouble seeing the color-specific stuff in the game. - Credit: /u/sourceoritsbullshit

* **Quicker chat** - Make it so when you type */* it opens the chat up. That way I can just type */clan* and start typing without having to hit enter every time.",self,t5_2siko,1366512688.0,orange,pc special mod manapot,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1cp1nd/comprehensive_suggestion_list/

Q: Does the race/background I pick matter?

A: Very minimally. As far as I know

Q: What are bits?

A: Bits are the in game cash shop currency. They are basically equivalent to Microsoft Points. Most of the cash shop items are cosmetic only

Q: So

A: If you're just starting out, Oranges seem to be dropping more frequently from level 3 boxes, however.)

Q: Weapon rarity? 

A: The names of weapons are in various different colors. The order, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange. 

Q: Ok

A: Absolutely not. I don't recommend entering pvp until your Ego level is at least 200.

Q: What is the difference between minor and major Ark Falls?

A: The biggest difference is the difficulty involved. In a major ark fall, it's best to stick to the minor ones. I recommend waiting until you have at least 100 ego before entering your first major fall. Any less and you'll probably just be in the way.

Q: How do self revives work? 

A: There is a small icon on your hud of a man in a grey box. This is your self revive timer

Q: So I'm fighting some hell bugs and then OHGODIMONFIREITBURNSAHHHHHH!

A: Not quite a question there

Other things:

Vendors are your friend! Always check back to see what the new deals and sales are. I've gotten some of my best middle tier gear that way.

When participating in Ark Falls, so don't be that guy who tries to melee the crystal.

Gear that drops is different for every player

Boost is A on the Xbox

Now get out there and make some scrip!



Edit: Here is some added information provided by your fellow Ark Hunters!

""You can unlock all four of the powers but can only equip one at a time. This also gives you access to perks that you wouldn't normally have access to. (Assuming you steer clear of ""Increases your (Individual power such as cloak) by X amount perks.)
For example you can pick Increase item drop by 3% if enemy is killed by an explosive, you can still use the perk if you have it equipped."" - TimeLordPony


""There are Co-op missions that are instanced like other MMOs. You have to go through a queue to get to them.
Command for the 360
Dpad Left: Quick Menu
Matchmaking
Coop Mission
It should list all the available Coop missions that you have as well as Quick Join. If you don't see any there

I learned this from defeating instances and Items disappearing only to end up there!"" - Alexiib

World of Warcraft for three years took it's toll... eventually I just wandered from game to game hunting for that one that would appease my damn near infinite hunger for variety in battle...

You have succeeded in saving this gamer! Defiance has given me the thing I desire... battle which isn't simple throwing skills at a target and a host of friends to fight alongside. The only other game that gave me this feeling was Hellgate: London... which sadly died. You've taken the genre I saw from them... and much improved on it! 

I see posts constantly complaining of bugs and issues. Few people have taken the time to appreciate what you've done so far. Know at least one gamer out there has seen your potential... and eagerly awaits your future content in Defiance. 

Thank you for everything you've done so far and for the awesome times now and in the future!

My concern is that it has, but the average Star Trek series would be cancelled by now and then limp along trying to write new episodes while always having the ""okay we're done"" last episode in mind. If it weren't for the game tie in for this show... who knows.

I'd like to see the long arc start developing in this show sooner than later. These characters need to be going somewhere not just dealing with the next problem to come along and be done with it by the end of  every episode.

* Going back to Episode 8 when Quentin decided to give the key to Nikki so that she would tell him where his mother was, told him not to give it up. This would indicate that it knew Nikki was looking for it and was actively trying to prevent that. Why?

* The only other person to hold a key was Doc Yewell, presumably so she could take it from the Doc. Why?

At this point I'm assuming that the AI is self-aware since it seems to be able to choose who to appear or not appear to. To our knowledge

So what exactly is Irisa's real role in all of this?

Since the AI can manifest itself to people who carry the keys

However since we know the ship is old

However it came into being

**2.) Nolan was never dead

* If the AI can make Irisa see it as a whole other person

* With Nolan alive, she now has motivation to seek it out in order ""sacrifice herself.""

* We only see him shot in the right shoulder which would wound and possibly cause him to pass out from blood loss. The AI adds a bit of glamour, which I like.) 

**TL; DR** ""Irzu"" and the Luke McCawley ""ghost"" were projections of the AI in the hidden ship. Nolan was never dead,Show Discussion,True,nsfw,t5_2siko,False,purple,True

1365384769.0,1bw0nq,Guide To ''Factions'' and how ''Reputation'' works. I will Update as we figure out more.,Madwac,33,6,20,"Alright so please be kind

So here it goes. Note that I am currently a 750ish Ego player

**Factions in Defiance and how they work.**

There seems to be 5 ''factions'' right now in the game.

* 1 which is PVP related ''Echelon''
* 1 which is related to the coop Maps you complete ''Paradise Territory''
* The 3 left are ''world'' factions  ''Von Bach Industries''

&gt; That's cool but how do I earn Reputation with said factions?

Well

* One that is quickly do-able and changes every 24 hours. Example: get x number of y from z mobs at w location, seem to only provide 10ish rep points for said faction** (number to verify)
* The other type of contract is a bit harder to complete

&gt; That's awesome! but I cannot find for the life of me the Contract list that you speak of! where is it?

The contract list can be found next to the ''pursuits'' list. Default key to access the Pursuit list is ''J'' on PC. Once you are there click on the ''contracts'' list right next to it. If you cannot see them yet

&gt;So now that I got Reputation with factions what do I do with it? and does it stop when the line completes?

* You use said Rep to buy certain items at the faction's ''HQ'' they all have their own vendors on special spots on the map. The way it works is you will see the script cost of a weapon and next to it the emblem of the faction with a number
* No, will change you status with said faction (example for the 1st time it goes from ''unknown to Familiar''). And you can keep on earning rep. What are the benefits of maxing a Reputation? I don't know yet, the game has been out for less than a week and I have school/work give me a break ;).

&gt;But Why would I even want to buy Faction related items?

For a few reasons.

* They are adequately priced.
* They have great starting stats
* But mostly because they give out ''synergy bonuses'' which can be seen before buying them. These bonuses stacks with the mod synergy bonuses (as per my understanding) making your guns truly stand out from normal drops.
* Also

*Important to note*

* It seems that once you complete the objectives of a contract
* The ''coop faction'' (name: Paradise Territory) only gives you contracts to complete a coop mission

* The ''PVP faction'' (name: Echelon) only gives contracts that seem to be do-able in shadow wars



EDIT: apparently when they do server restarts the contracts tend to change and restart so it's either a good thing (if you wanna farm lots of small quick ones) or a bad thing (if you were working on a tough long one :( )

Alright I hope this was helpful, change the numbers and names to correct ones when I can verify them. Also, be kind english is only my 2nd language ;) 

Happy hunting fellow Ark scavengers !

I started playing Defiance two days after the TV premier.  I like RP servers on my MMO’s, and she is closing in on 900 ego.  

Here is my biggest complaint about the game:  Where are all the women?  

Now I’m not talking about the storyline, so I can brush that aside.  

But when running around shooting mutants, and Dark Matter I really have to wonder, Where are all the women?  Is there not even a small percentage that was as strong as their male counterparts?  Was it an odd, gender specific virus that killed them off?  Did they all say “Fuck this” and move away?  

Are they scared that gamers will freeze in indecision when faced with a pair of tits behind the machine gun?  

I don’t think so.  I think they would shoot her in the face, she’s not that big of a bad ass.  My least favorite Major arkfall, seeing as everyone just stands around and shoots her in the face, then adjusts where they are standing slightly before she comes back up.  

Maybe there are female bad guys somewhere in the world and I just don’t have time to notice them.  Shoot and move on.   Honestly, just long enough to say “Hey look!  A girl!” feeling perhaps a jolt of pride and equality and smiling as I introduce the girlie to my VOT Techmag Pulsar.  

P.S.  And what’s the deal with only Irathi men getting top hats?  I can understand some outfits changing a little between sexes, I should be able to wear a frakkin’ top hat.  I got a head.

1375635566.0,1joqto,"Why Defiance's price drop was not just a good, but a great idea.",Radiogirl1,33,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1joqto/why_defiances_price_drop_was_not_just_a_good_but/

I was in the beta and enjoyed my time in the game, there was just no way I could justify sixty bucks for a new video game, especially not when there are so many free alternatives out there, not to mention all the games I already own.

Then, I'd already watched and enjoyed the entire first season of the show and I eagerly bought the game.

Frankly, with entertainment budgets usually the first to be trimmed on shrinking incomes, it's a lot easier to get players to shell out ten bucks than sixty bucks on a single entertainment purchase.

If no one wants to pay the asking price on a given game, that includes bumping up the show's ratings and therefore sponsor advertising rates), more players play and the game survives to make more money for the publishers. When you consider that Defiance cost an estimated 100 million to make, that's a lot of incentive to keep the game viable as long as possible.

I mean, nor would many other players, and it wouldn't be as good of a game without those players playing. 

What the price drop did was help to ensure that the game survives and with it not only Trion's and Syfy's investment in it

1370643238.0,1fw494,A Humble Collection of Ideas,Takarias,30,7,13,"I've come to realize that Defiance as it shipped was a half-finished game. No, and I feel that Trion actually dealt with (and still is dealing with) these issues pretty well. So kudos to Trion for that.

No, the endgame. Every day, this subreddit sees a post that asks Trion for 'more meat,' or asks what there is left to do, or asks for an active guild because their's is dead. The truth is, there is no more meat, there's nothing to aim for

Here I have compiled a selection of suggestions that I feel would greatly benefit the game at large by promoting continued engagement. As people invest more hours into the game

**AUCTION HOUSE**
-----
-----

Perhaps the most frequently-requested feature

**Buying**
The auction house itself should allow for multiple filters (manufacturer, keyword searches, ect…) to make it easy for prospective buyers to find what they are looking for. Upon finding what they wish to purchase, players are then taken to the seller's storefront, where they confirm their purchase, as well as having the ability to favorite that seller, if they have consistently good prices. (This adds loyalty as well as player identity.)

**Selling**
On the selling end of things, creating a player-driven economy. (This will be expanded upon in a number of ways throughout this post.)

**SOCIAL INTERACTION**
-----
-----
Players need a place to congregate, I will explain within the corresponding section.

This section would include the nearly requisite complaints and suggestions for the chat system

**HOUSING**
-----
-----
Players should have a space to call their own. In other words, or the room of one of your friends or clanmates. When in your own room, you would have access to personal storage.

Players don't just get a free ride, scrip. A basic house is cheap; a dusty shanty house, rotten through with rust. But if you've got the jaja, you can buy fancier houses. Maybe you'd like a Castithan commode complete with bath? And, of course, you could buy some housing with bits. Once you own a theme for your house, you can change it at any time with a control panel in the house.

**Decorate!**
And of course, crafted yourself, earned from pursuits! Kill 500 Pow? Here's a Pow head to mount on your wall!

**MORE AND BETTER EMERGENCIES**
-----
-----
I should clarify. I don't mean more active at a time in the world

This system has promise, more non-humanoid enemies. Show us some of this alien fauna!)

**CLANS**
-----
-----
Clans certainly exist right now, but with people leaving the game every day, there's ever-decreasing incentive to do so. Obviously, clans need a complete overhaul. But what needs to be done?

The biggest issue facing clans today is identity. Clans need to be able to build their own identity and differentiate themselves from the crowd. They also need a way to help the members of that clan feel like they are part of an exclusive group

**A Place to Call Home**
Every world-changing organization needs an impressive headquarters, but a large building of some description that acted as a portal to a personalized clan hangout that only the members of the clan would be able to access.

This clan base could have any number of additional features and benefits for members, message board allowing communication/trading between people that aren't online at the time, ect…

**Only as Good as the Outfit**
Any powerful organization worth its salt has a banner to rally under, but this is probably stepping on the toes of premium content a bit too much.

**LOOT**
-----
-----
Everything about the current state of loot should stay exactly as it is. I know, lootable pieces. Pieces that are then crafted together to create new and exciting weapons. These weapons wouldn't just be there for a new set of stats, but they would work differently, and would directly tie into the auction house.

**Unique Craftables**
Each piece that a player finds belongs to a specific final weapon, but also much less harder to get all of the pieces for. This creates a market not only for the finished product, but also for the individual pieces.

**Elemental Cores**
Rather than have a set element for each final weapon, a Fire Core, a Syphon Core, and so on.

This idea could also be expanded to include an item that would set an inherent mod synergy for the weapon.

**Loot Tables**
As far as I know, people will have to grind for loot. Which, if my crafting system and auction house was put in place, grinding for said loot would give a definitive benefit.

**Guns with a Level**
With craftable loot, right? Well, what if each gun you craft can level up? Kinda like guns do currently, but they can level up more than once. Let's say… 10 times, just for a number. Each time you level up a gun, you get a bonus applied to it, much like the current system. What if you don't like the latest bonus? Throw it back in the salvage matrix and take a level/bonus off the gun. Do it enough times and get lucky enough, but it'll cost you to do that.

If you decide to sell this max-level weapon, and what bonuses are on the weapon will all affect the market value, which is determined by the community based on how much they're willing to spend for certain combinations.

**COMBAT SPECIALIZATION**
-----
-----
Another major issue that Defiance has at the current time is that everyone is more or less identical. This is an issue with implementing a classless system

But… for better or worse, allowing players to change specializations at any time, just by swapping loadouts. Each specialization would function as a traditional class, but could be freely changed whenever the player wanted.

You could have a specialization that would make you have really high DPS and shield regen, and capacity of BMGs (which, the game should be harder so these things are actually worthwhile.)

The benefit of these specializations is that they allow players to change up their playstyle as frequently as they want without losing the progress on their characters (the benefit of a classless system

As with my weapon level overhaul proposal, but there needs to be something to set us apart from the newbs and even each other.)

These leveled specializations could also be traded through an auction house

-----

**And now I open discussion to everyone.** I'd like to steer this away from bitching about the UI this, but god dammit, we can keep Defiance alive!

Here's the deal.  Since sieges have come out I've been addicted to them and have found information useful in both a strategic and casual manner about this game mode.  Before I get into it though, dip your toes in with the afflicted event and here's hoping that the Volge sieges will be much, much more challenging because the play style of a siege is enthralling.

**Looking to Siege?  Here's Some Tips:**

* Sieges appear approximately once an hour on the open map
* Sieges are 15 minutes long when triggered, I'm not certain which.  I'll investigate further.
* You only need to clear out enemies of each stage to complete that stage and start a new one.  Capture points are not necesary, all players in the siege area gain ~~30~~ 60 score/second).
* End rewards are based off of personal score
* As far as the afflicted go
* You gain weapon experience normally in a siege
* The easiest way to chain sieges together as it stands is to finish one and change phases.  Since the timer for sieges starts after the siege is over
* Sieges seem to progress much quicker with masses of players helping out.  Enemies scale in hitpoints like arkfalls, with approximately 60 players in the fray.
* Bosses are not worth many points compared to creeps, Chinatown Gate hosts Bulwarks at stage 8 first, and then stage 12.
* Sieges are a wonderful place for explosive weapons.  That being said, and Assassin's Cache (for Detonators) are great starter choices.  Unfortunately, the Afflicted have a low drop rate so Pinata or Just Reward aren't very effective.

I think that's it for now.  If anybody wants to add anything don't hesitate to chip in to the list

And for any of you who haven't seen it

I’ve had this week off work and I’ve played for  roughly 60 hours (Yea, but as a Brit I have to wait until the evening to play at all. I don’t have a major issue with this but I can see how some people may find it irritating that they cannot log on and grab a solid match at all for five hours. 


There are some serious negatives to this game. My most minor of the issues is that it feigns the MMO genre by a) offering quests and b) having many people present at once. The most interaction I’ve had with other players constitutes two emotes and a single line of text from an angry player regarding a PvP match. That’s 60 hours and no real interaction with anyone aside from the occasional fire fight in the same area. The game doesn’t feel or act like an MMO and while, the game feels very much like borderlands (not in theme, moreover in feel) if the world was constantly active and people didn’t need to connect to your session, they were just there. Doing their own thing. [NO SPOILERS] The quests from the major plot are repetitive and bland, although to be fair the storyline is quite good. It’s not as fleshed out as I expected but it’s certainly worth a playthrough. Every single main quest follows the same format from start to finish and it gets seriously fucking boring. The EGO in your brain (the computer plugin) has about 5 lines of ‘incoming’ text and every fucking mission does this shit where you go in, save someone, defend them while they do some shit on a computer then the EGO cycles through the same 4 lines.



‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE NORTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE SOUTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE EAST!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE WEST!’



You then defeat the waves one by one


‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE NORTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE SOUTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE EAST!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE WEST!’


Shit. I don’t know if others haven’t noticed this but even on the hell bug quests you do the objective and then it’s just spam waves like a boss. There’s no real variation and it’s not covered up particularly well. 


Quite frankly the side quests are embarrassing, and the objective is usually within around a 10 second drive and takes less than a minute to complete. They are seriously awful and seem like a total rushed afterthought. 


As a predominantly PvP interested player, yet there is only one gametype (I understand another was removed and will be returning). Also that open microphone shit in PvP. I play on a fucking PC, not a console. I don’t expect to have to mute everyone every fucking match because some guys kid is crying and someone else is giving their microphone a blowjob while he has major building work going on in the next room. We’re past that, and it’s fucking irritating to hear. 


I’ve enjoyed my time with defiance but there’s just no content left for me to come back to. In my personal opinion this game wasn’t worth 35 quid for what I got out of it and I certainly won’t be purchasing any DLC if the content is just as rushed and paper thin as what I’ve seen so far. This is quite a negative rant but if the price drops to 25, as this game has a lot of feeling and is quite enjoyable – it just feels rushed and unfinished. I’m sure there will be updates and new PVP maps to add to the existing TWO choices, but I have a feeling it will be more of the same. If you’re looking for an expensive single player game with console values (repetition, low levels of social interaction and being rather blasé about the entire content/dlc thing all the while hearing some fat guy eating a pot noodle through a straw) sure, this game is perfect to drop cash on. Otherwise I’d do some homework on it first and check out some of the reviews. 

The EGO pages are bland and boring and the variations are bland and uninteresting. There's no real personal touches or decisions here

It’s not a terrible game but it’s certainly nothing special and in places gets downright tiresome and boring


Just my 2 pence for anyone looking to maybe purchase. Honestly it sounds very negative but it's an OK game. Honestly if I could get frequent and varied pvp from the game regularly and on time I'd be very happy.

1371861441.0,1gtw0q,THEORY: Earth was to be conquered (And that is still the plan!),angeleus09,24,7,24,"TL; DR It may not have been the initial plan

We all know the story: the Votans, they asked for refuge and we all know what happened next.

With the recent revelation that the Votans studied humans well before they arrived on Earth and went so far as to prepare sleeper assassin clones who would have had access to Earth's leaders

At this point I think one of two things happened within the Votan leadership:

* They split into two factions. One which argued that we didn't deserve our planet and  advocated getting rid of us completely or subjugating us for service
* There was a majority agreement that we needed to go

Whether it was just a faction of the Votan leadership acting directly or indirectly to further their own interests or a unanimous strategy,](http://defiancenews.tumblr.com/post/45272885049/breaking-news-18-march-2023) does anyone remember the persuasion method Pol Matis used on Datak in [Episode Six?](http://www.defiance.com/en/series/video/2646784)

**Why would the Votans risk the casualties of war on their own side?**

I'm guessing they calculated that their advanced weaponry and medical technology would minimize their losses. Not only were their conventional weapons stronger than ours, it is more likely that they were purposely held in reserve as a strategic military advantage.

**But why would the Votans destroy their Ark ships and so many of their people along with them?**

I think the original plan (for taking over) was to use as few Votans as possible on the ground to clear out or significantly reduce the human presence on Earth and after they had taken over

The destruction of the Arks was either a last ditch effort by humans, wide-scale destruction. 

**Well now there is no option, right?**

According to the [World Map of 2046](http://www.defiance.com/en/series/world-of-2046/2046-map) the large colony of Sulos in South America is continuously expanding it's borders year after year. It is also a popular belief that the construction of the coast-to-coast maglev train by the E-Rep is actually a plan to build the infrastructure for a line of defense to prevent a Votan push north. I believe the Votans are still intent on conquering as much of the habitable space left on Earth as they can.

**Great

If you remember when Pol Matis and Datak were talking they spoke of the Votan leadership in South America in a way that made them sound almost like the mob

1370936496.0,1g3wod,The Plague: A Theory,Tobar,17,2,9,"First I want to say that the event on the whole was fun. Sieges are a fantastic new addition to the game and I'll be saddened having to wait for them to return after this week has passed.


That said

Why this is

This is the chain of events as we were presented:


* **Week One**: A sickness has broken out across Paradise and a series of data recorders reveal that it is the start of an epidemic. It is also revealed that Eren has sent the arkhunter (you the player) out to gather resources to work on a cure
* **Week Two**: Stage Four of the sickness has spread out across Paradise wreaking havoc. Sieges appear where you are seemingly tasked with protecting dispensers that contain a cure that Eren has concocted.  
* **Week Three**: An episode mission appears on your map and when you arrive Eren expresses her gratitude that you are there. No explanation is given as to how you knew to meet her there or why. She remains quiet while you run across Dark Matter


From the very start this event felt disjointed and lacking of much context. Which is why I theorize that large chunks are missing. I believe the intended sequence of events went something like this:


* **Week One**: A sickness has started to spread across Paradise. Eren summons you
* **Week Two**: Eren sends you out to gather materials to work on a cure as the inflicted raise havoc across Paradise. You gather all of the needed materials and are then tasked with completing at least one siege to protect the dispensers until they can launch to release the cure into the surrounding atmosphere.  
* **Week Three**: Meanwhile


As for how Dark Matter fit into this. There are a number of possibilities. One is that the ICBM belonged to Dark Matter and they didn't appreciate its theft. Two


I believe it's a strong probability that the Irathient Flu was purposefully weaponized in another attempt to destroy the town of Defiance.


What still remains a mystery is how Eren learned of the ICBM and how she was able to repurpose it in such a drastic way through the launch panel in a matter of minutes. It's possible she had already done all of the necessary work beforehand when Dark Matter showed up to prevent the launch.

*This is my first public attempt at some fan fiction and I thought I'd post here to get some feedback.  I've been a casual writer for a long time and an really into the Defiance lore, so enjoy!*



**Cloud Ninety-Nine**



Patrol duty never did pay off well, but at least lending a helping hand to the military medics had its perks.

She decided to pull in behind a half-rubble house and park for a break.  They called it a point of safety, the ark hunter had her fair share of favours to call her house as close to safe as one could get.  Her roller had seen better days, she could tell from the way her half-busted driver side mirror rained shattered glass onto her lap when it was popped open.

Yeah, but unfortunately her safe house didn’t come with a running shower.  It was no matter though, because relief was at hand as she brushed off the glass from her outfit and unlatched the glove compartment.

Complete in a stainless steel pouch was a single serving of her latest addiction

Building the cell and slipping its sharp point under the skin of her forearm, and what started as a joke of the trade soon became an ode to the fallen.

Rubbing her hand from cheek to brow in a slow dredge, masking the midday glow with her palm.  “Yeah, that’ll be the day.”

Not that she wasn’t making enough money to keep comfortable, a bed that wasn’t a car seat, a fresh meal, clothes not crusted in blood, and smokes.  Oh, cigarettes were a royal treat.

Paradise of relaxation was abruptly ended when her dashboard monitor screeched a warning signal.  The gadget startled her nerves and she reacted quickly to scan any information from the event.  Incoming arkfall

“Paydirt, bearing impact less than a klick off the bridge.  Here’s hoping it doesn’t wreck itself.”

The Irath’s dirty car bellowed a roar as it swiveled out of its half-broken garage.  Already miniature debris was pelleting the area, but a photographic wonder to the new world.

Blazing above the Overpass, the hunter sent out a message of her own after military orders were sent.   “Don’t think you’ll be getting a cut from any of this, Clancy.”

For a moment there was no answer, Sixteen.  Much of a grudge you have against Grant, the EMC has your back when you hit impact point.”

“You boys make San Fran a cozy place

“Wouldn’t be half as nice without the help

In a wild screech the veteran stopped her car after hitting Golden Gate, rummaging through wreckage there’d be something recognizable.  It brought a sincere smile to her face as she unclipped her receiver and nabbed some thicker wear from the back seat.

It was only after padding was donned and the driver door opened with a kick that there came sounds unknown

“No chance on staying ignorant to where the wild things are
 
Just like a play on stage, wrapping up with a vile conflict for glorious dramatic appeal.  And in turn, rumbling of the military’s heavy Titan trucks approached from the distant south and mysterious figures launched onto the bridge from the north with weapons ready.

It was a civil understanding that fellow hunters cleared vital threats before degrading to bickering over the spoils of war.  Not always followed, some were new faces, and a select few she wouldn’t see again.  Such was the life of her career.

“Cover up

The bridge wasn’t her first rodeo near open water, the fireball hit with a shockwave mean enough to turn Golden Gate into a white water river.  Debris of old cars washed away and the unprepared had trouble enough not joining the rusty frames in the blast.  Thaeya, however, was happy enough to only have down to her shoulders soaked in the downpour.

Bits of blazing metal were sprawled in all directions.  Sparks and faulty electronics littered the bridge making it a dangerous position for anyone distracted enough to take a wrong step.  Impact caused so much steam it was a chore determining north from south anymore

“Call out any sudden movements!”  The Irath shouted hard

Nothing, and being deafened didn’t calm her nerves.  

One hundred second passed

Thunderous bass rumbled from the north perking her attention and her gun in that direction, and the squealing bug clipped Thaeya’s jaw before detonating mid-air in confetti of guts and glory.

“Tango sighted!  Bravo

The hunter wiped her wound with her knuckles in a shameful grimace.  She hated being caught off guard.  It wouldn’t happen again

This is a list of fixs/suggestions that I personally would enjoy seeing in the game. feel free to make your own. I'm on my cellphone so bare with me of words coming out wrong (auto-correct) or if the format sends you into a blood frenzy.

1. Chat- By now I'm sure everyone knows how unfriendly the chat is and how it's killing the community. here is where I don't mind at all if they ""steal"" it from other MMOs, he'll suffocate long before he bleeds out.

2. Centralized player Hub-  This is a Multi-Fold suggestion that goes back to the community and convieniance. One of the reasons this game feels socially dead is because of the lack of a true gathering spot for players, new/old players that have questions that need to be answered and recruitment much easier.


3. Another thing about a Centralized Hub is convenience, or trade. To prevent vehicle griefing placing shops inside, behind a railing, or slightly elevated would help immensely.


4. With a Centralized hub or even two

5. This could also extend to the Shadow War


6. Major Arkfalls- These are great, trucks, and all kind of other ways, you can make a large facility or mobile base of sorts for players to fight in, and the ""Boss"" could be a number of things, from one strong trashing about the place, a small group of special forces types


7. Loot- Don't know about others


8. Salvage. click. click. yes. click- for the love of whatever deity you have chosen to fill the void in your life allow us to have an option to Auto-Salvage rarity types. Example: Auto-Salvage Blue and below


9. Story Mission Replays- Neat story


10. Cerberus Based Missions-  Me and my friends doing donuts running over raiders and blasting them away with mounted guns? yes please.


11. The Menu UI- I'm sure it's on a drawing board somewhere being redone


12. EGO score- This is an odd one to mention i'm sure and it may be a little too late to change the progress rate, the score number could reset back to 0 be much slower to progress and have some symbol next to it or something, guess like prestige from other games. three years from now I'd hate to to still be 5,000, or have the 0s take over my top bar.


13. Solo Instancing-  Maybe a world message if someone manages to complete an Instance Solo without extracting and some some separate achievements from doing it grouped (Scrapworks gives you a different color of the EMC Heavy Trooper or something). I'd enjoy the challenge even without incentives


14. Loot Gambling- Similar to the Diablo series and the lockbox system, but you'll still use him because it's addicting, this gives you more things to spend script on, and you don't have to worry about getting 4 shotguns from a lockbox if you can afford it.

15. Profanity Filter- On or Off switch

16. Shut up and take my money!- More outfits and crap to stick on me head in the shop. Why so few? do you hate money? I'm mad about hats! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJkg_9536PU

Pistols: Way underappreciated. Look for high crit value. Good for long Arkfall fights and when dealing with the bigger bugs. The slow firing ones are just too slow.

Shotguns: Way overappreciated. Range is short

Assault Rifles: Never leave home without one. Take damage over rate of fire to make your ammo last longer.

SMG: Spray-'n-pray. You get the most out of a larger (80 round) clip. Not much difference between a fast firing AR and a SMG

LMG: Like the AR but with its own ammo pool. Long reloads.

Sniper Rifle: I'll take the auto over manual any day since the crosshairs return to the exact same position after recoil and you can spam fire. Crit rating is the most important value.

Big-things-that-go-BOOM: Do a lot less damage than you'd expect them to. Somewhat useful (but shiny) in coop or Arkfalls. Run out ammo real fast.

1366921788.0,1d3uei,Vision for Defiance,vbl,35,20,32,"I've been thinking a lot about what I'd like the game to become and decided to write it down. I do reserve the right to edit and add to this as time goes on


**The World**

We're living in a semi-post-apocalytic place populated by aliens and humans. The landscape, money is tight, everyone is competing for the same resources and survival is anything but a given. Threats come fast, unexpectedly and often. Trust is rare. 


**The Current Player Experience**

The game does not match this promise. 

I'm rich. I'm rarely in any mortal danger. If I do die, negotiate, fight, sneak, steal, group up, save

I own more than ten vehicles and they all fit in my pocket. Most of them were purchased for 500 scrip

Granted

But **none** of it has any gravity because you're okay without it and doing it is easy.  The world doesn't change much and my character doesn't change much and it's all very stale and shallow.


**The Evolving Player Experience**

Mostly

**All enemies will be balanced

* Enemies will have their baseline stats start at the equivalent stats for a 4 player group

* We will introduce better tools (LFG comm feed) to help you find groups for missions and challenges. You can still solo and pair play


**Death will suck more:**

* Extracting will drop you at a hospital facility at the nearest settlement (with the existing 180 scrip penalty for transport and patching you up).

* You still get a timed self-revive and you can still be revived by friends


**Vehicles will be fewer in number and matter more:**

* All color variations will be changed to paint jobs

* All vehicles will have storage added

* Vehicles scrip prices increased across the board. All players still receive the starting Growler.

* Purchased vehicles are more noticeably improved over base Growler.

* Vehicles no longer disappear and get summoned within seconds.

* If in the field

* Requesting your vehicle from another location requires someone to retrieve it for you

* Cars returned to settlements can be stored and summoned immediately


**We're adding more ways for you to interact with other. Aside from the increase in difficulty (see #1)

* All settlements will have a pub and casino where players can bet scrip on several games of chance

* We're adding a WANTED board for players to post gear bounties. Request an item


**Reputation system overhaul:**

* Players may grant each other reputation points. You can only grant one rep point per day

* Faction reputation now consists of prominence and credit. Prominence increases as contracts are completed and grants access to better items


**Survival elements will be added:**

* Each player has a stockpile of food, can yield supplies as part of completion.

* Crates and containers will be marked with food

* Players may only store a maximum of supplies at a time

* Running out of supplies results in daily scrip loss as players pay for food

* Clan members share a common supply pool

* No money and no supplies results in an inability to pursue formal missions or challenges and penalties to health and sprint speed (i.e. you need to go into the world and replenish your resources before you die)


**Revisions to weapons:**

* Using EXP-maxed weapons will now raise your overall weapon skill

* Players may mark one weapon as a ""trusted firearm"", fire rate, mag size, reload speed, etc.); only one weapon may be marked as a trusted firearm, and this can only be changed once every 72 hours

* Trusted firearms may be given custom names (""The Violator"")

* Firearms wear out over time and must be repaired regularly using ark salvage; worn out weapons are not destroyed, with a ""repair all"" button; wear and tear is shown next to the weapon info; frequently-used weapons can be marked to auto-repair


**EGO customization and revisions:**

* Voice packs will be added that allow you to change the personality

* Your EGO will start to make commentary about things around you based on reputation of other players


**Cash shop changes:**

* Cash shop helmets and outfits halved in price

* More vehicle types added to cash shop; all side grades to vehicle available in game

* EGO customization packs available


**Quality of life changes:**

* Grouped players will always and automatically phase together when entering open world missions (such as Seascape Farms)

* Co-op instances now reset correctly

* Items can be salvaged directly from inventory

* Salvaged items can be recovered similarly to the buy back feature at vendors (for up to 48 hours)

* Flag for items to make them ""unsellable/unsalvagable""

* Player storage/lockers added at most fast travel locations

* Barbers now available in most settlements where players can change their hair for a scrip fee

* Enemy AI improved to be more menacing and unpredictable

* Enemies now spawn with occasional buffs

* Enemies may drop mods as loot instead of weapons and shields


**...and after that?**

* Player housing

* Faction warfare (true open world PvP)

* PvE and PvP raids

* Underground facilities

1364365037.0,1b3ic9,PC Field of View,Notturno,13,0,5,"Hey reddit

I made a fairly long post on the [PC Beta Feedback Forum](http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?10621-Field-of-View) about field of view in the PC version of the game. For those who don't want to go to the forums

*****

**Field of View**

I have [posted about this before](http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?6456-PC-Settings-Requests), is critical to the game's success on the PC platform.

**What is Field of View?**

Field of view (FOV) is the degree of vision you have available. A human has a complete 180 degree field of vision, which dictates how many degrees around your character you can see. A low FOV setting would result in seeing things closer up, but you would have less peripheral vision of what's going on to your left and right. There are also vertical elements to FOV, but that's another discussion entirely.

All you need to know is that FOV determines how much you can see to the left and right of your character.

**I'm still confused

That's fine! Perhaps a visual display will help out. Here's a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G7wKzDoUMY) a YouTuber made that showcases what field of view does. If you don't have the patience to watch through a whole video

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/mObQRwZ.gif)

[Image Source](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=464152)

As you can see, you can only see what's directly in front of you unless you physically turn your head, or in this case move your mouse. It's an incredibly disorienting experience for some gamers; many PC gamers playing at low FOV report experiencing headaches, or in extreme cases nausea from extended sessions. 

I know some people are probably calling B.S. at this point

When playing on a console, you are getting the necessary sense of depth because you have the real world still in your field of view, so the lower FOV settings do not impact you as much. Here's a visual representation of how that works:

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/NrNYr.png)

[Image Source](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=464152)

You can see in the above image why PC gamers would be disoriented. Instead of retaining your sense of peripheral vision like you would sitting further away from your monitor

**Why is it like this in Defiance?**

I cannot speak for why Trion has the game presented in this way, there are other issues that can result in low FOV settings. Increasing your field of view means the game client renders more game assets at once. This means you are demanding more from your GPU in each frame, which means lower performance. Since consoles are notorious for having weak hardware, FOV is capped to provide a consistent performance across all consoles. Having a lower FOV means you can provide higher quality art assets than if you had a higher FOV.

**What can Trion can do about this?**

I've been noticing more and more a problem when my gun's mag runs out of ammo, and the gun is still empty. 

For example, the gun reloads 25 of the remaining 100 rounds, but then resets the gun to 0 round in the mag, and 75 left available for reloads. Then it goes to 0 and 50...then 0 and 25...then I'm out of ammo after only shooting 1 mags worth. 

Anyone else seeing this issue?

EDIT: Glad to know I'm not alone here. Lets all report this as a bug then. I've had a little luck working around this issue by swaping to my 2nd weapon then back to main weapon and reload then. Anyone else have workaround suggestions?

EDIT2: For the people having this issue - does it only happen on certain guns? I think it started to happen to me when I mod'd my first weapon for faster reload times. Maybe just guns with mod'd reload times are having this issue? I need to check my guns tonight to verify this theory.

1365439823.0,1bxddp,Getting Started in Defiance,acefisher1,15,1,28,"I noticed a lot of people having some of the same issues I was when I first started playing Defiance. I didn’t have any pre-amble, but these are my tips. Use them as you like

Learning to play Defiance is a bit of a task. There is very little in the way of “real world tutorialization” in
the world of Defiance. I’m going to post a few points I feel would have really helped me out when I started the 
game. 

The top thing I see players doing wrong in Defiance is a big deal. 
**Don’t shoot the Skitterlings around arkfalls (the little crab looking hellbugs).**They open tears in the shards (big glowing crystal thing in the center of the arkfall) that you can then damage the shard through.

**Use your EGO Power!!!!** I can’t stress this enough. This power should be used the second it becomes available every time it’s up. This is your tide turner, but honestly if you utilize it properly, you won’t need to escape, you’ll have already won the fight. If you have **Overpower** on, target fire the highest-priority target, also be sure to empty your magazine before hitting Overpower, as it reloads your weapon instantly. If you have **Cloak**, reposition, this power is the weakest in my opinion

**Items in your inventory cannot be dropped, or broken down for materials until they are removed from EVERY loadout slot** in your loadouts screen. This is a very common issue I see players complaining about, and it’s a simple fix, but a frustrating problem nonetheless.  

**On the road again. Use the road!** The game has an unfortunate failing when it comes to traversing the map with your ATV, rock, or unlikely pebble, and you’ll find yourself turned the wrong way or vertical on a tree truck in no time. Use the road, boost like theres no tomorrow. Drain that boost every chance it’s filled. Just set a waypoint (right click a spot on the map on PC) and follow the main road around, and you’ll be anywhere in under 2 minutes. The longest drive I’ve dealt with was about 3 minutes using only roads. 

**Take the time to go to every market spot on the map when you’re nearby for any reason** until you’ve unlocked the fast travel spot at that location. It’s unbelievably important to have all the fast travel spots so that when an arkfall begins across the map you can instantly travel nearby to it and be there to start running that damage meter up. The fast travel spots show up as blue arrows. Don’t leave the camp until you see it show up on the map

**Do a lot of Arkfall events**. Every time you do a story mission
being a major arkfall. These give the most meaningful rewards of anything in the game. They take a bit of time, and currency that are amongst, if not the most, efficient method of getting these things in the game currently. As it should be, you are an Ark Hunter by trade after all. 

**Salvage items, you need to stop and salvage every item you aren’t using in a loadout. Find a weapon setup that works for you for each loadout, and stick with it. You level up weapons and thus, should continue to use the same ones for long periods of time. Only keep items in your inventory if they are actively used frequently. Certain items can always be broken down instantly. The second I get any bio-std grenade types (slowdown mechanic, little to no damage), I break them down into salvage. You’ll get enough in-game currency through missions and challenges to buy anything you need. **The only time you should be selling items** is for a couple reason; one, the item is worth upwards of 1, there is a specific item you want to buy
	
Don’t worry about buying items from vendors. There is the occasional upgrade that boosts you a few points
overall the vendors sell bad weapons
weapons from lockboxes. You can be more efficient by killing off lots of enemies and looting bad weapons to
 break down to salvage and then buying keys. 

	
**Try a bunch of different weapons**. Don’t be afraid to give something a shot. There is a key here though. Not every weapon works well in every scenario. You’ll have access to two load outs fairly early on in the game, or two quick weaker shots. This is a huge difference, and will change the way it should be used.  
	
**Pick up every item that drops**. If it isn’t useful (and few things you pick up will be) **you can immediately break it down for salvage**

  	 
**When you get bored doing something, or falling into the story missions and feeling obligated to keep going. You can stop doing anything, anytime, and go do a random side mission, time challenge, or hotshot. Go do something random! Everything has rewards in this game. The least rewarding of all of these are the time trials, and the most lucrative are the side missions.  
	
**Explosive weapons for hellbugs; machine guns for mutants. This is my mantra
Shotguns can be used for both these applications. Explosive weapons tend to have too low of an ammo count
and reload time for dealing with groups of mutants. The big’uns included. A we placed elemental burst to a
Mutant Chain Gunner’s melon will melt him faster than a barrage of detonator rounds any day. Even when you’re 
spec’d towards explosives like I am. Get a group of mutants together and drop a grenade into the pack. They’ll 
be weakened and go down easily under a hail of machine gun fire or shotgun pellets. **Elemental weapons are king when it comes to Mutants**. Fire and forget with a volley from your burning status effect assault rifle or SMG and take cover while they burn to death and you have a quick smoke behind that barrel. 
 
**Carry a gun in one of your loadouts to deal with strong single enemies**. There is almost always one very powerful or at least highly powered enemy in every pack of enemies that are worth fighting. It’s important to have a strong weapon for single-target fire to deal with them

You can download the [binaries](https://github.com/zeiban/defiance-tools/releases/download/v0.2.0/Defiance-Tools-0.2.0.7z) and [source](https://github.com/zeiban/defiance-tools/archive/v0.2.0.zip) from the Github [release](https://github.com/zeiban/defiance-tools/releases) page.

While I was testing and looking for meshes with issues I found meshes with missing textures. This not uncommon since a lot of assets are in partial development. What caught my eye was the assets were named in a way playable characters assets are named with the following. ski_1pc_XX where XX is one of the following.


* **hm** - Human Male
* **hf** - Human Female  
* **im** - Irath Male 
* **if** - Irath Female 
* **cm** - Castithan Male
* **cf** - Castithan Female


These assets have **bm** in the name and would match ""Bioman Male"". Based off these [renders](http://imgur.com/a/8A6AP) they look like Biomen to me even with the missing textures. Here is an [image](http://imgur.com/efeNOl8) of all the suspected Bioman mesh files.

So i think from today i will remove any of these i see and i hope the other mods will too.

Also on the thing of NDA if you are making videos of the Game and posting them to Youtube etc this is breaking NDA too and you could get your Youtube account messed up with copyright claims etc.

Arkfalls are cool, which was disappointing. 

Like I said, and the game isn't much fun for me anymore. I know they did the hellbug events, but the random events on the road get boring.

I feel like the show is outlasting the game, and weapons are pretty balanced so trying to get the best weapon ever isn't that big of a priority.

I want to get the pursuit for getting 50,000 and I don't see myself getting close any time soon. Anyone have any ideas for something to do? I haven't been playing it hardly at all lately, and the last time I played it I was bored in about 10 minutes.

Here's a link to the Skill Calculator

http://defiance-central.com/ego-calculator/

For me personally

[I call my build ""The Diversion."" Here's a link to it.](http://defiance-central.com/ego-calculator/?link=2c-3a-4a-5c-12d-21c-31a-41c-&amp;start=12)

*Note: I just put enough points to get the four main perks I'm able use. But at 461 you'll have many more points to put into perks. Just pick whatever you want really*

**EGO 461**

* Decoy (**Perks:** Pumped Up, and Self-Medicated)
* 3 Round Burst AR
* Ground Pounder
* Respark Shield - 1051,
* Frag Grenade 

Play style is just to shoot everything with the AR and switch to the Ground Pounder for Monarchs.

Decoy to distract enemies. Whether it be to go revive someone or just take the heat off of you so you can regain your shields.

That's my main build. I haven't put much thought into it but it sees me consistently getting top 3 in Arkfalls.

I'd love to see some builds using the other 3 EGO powers. Because I have no idea how to properly play them. ",self,t5_2siko,1366427154.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1cpthy/why_is_no_one_talking_about_builds/

I have two questions
Question 1: Which NPC
Question 2 - Beyond Arkfalls

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Right now the focus is on more dynamic co-op game modes in the open world rather than instances. It's something we'd like to do though and this is very often asked.

Xavier Horovitz

Hey Defiance dudes! I've got two questions for you. I hope I'm allowed to do that!
Question One: As a guy who really loves the aspect of clans in an MMO
Question Two: Has there been any talk about bringing Defiance to the next generation of consoles? With the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 on their way out the door for many gamers, but having shared servers would be remarkable. That is to say, a shared server between the PS3/PS4 as well as a shared server between the 360/Next Xbox. In short, the lack of a next-gen plan will spell doom for the consoles versions of Defiance.

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)
&gt;
1. Yes, Clan warfare and shared benefits (banks, bases, boosts, spandex wardrobe).
&gt;2. Yes, this is very much just another platform for the Defiance client to be on and a natural progression. Stay tuned.

spartan1124

What are your plans for an enhanced crafting system? Will we see one someday
 
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)
&gt;
It is indeed very much on the roadmap.

aydenpride

In defiance will end game content show up where a skilled group of players take down instanced bosses much like your co-op maps but on a larger scale of 10 or more players? Also any chance of a loot table being present in only these raids and not outside with the exception of maybe lock boxes?

&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;For bigger battles - its a fun idea
  
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Yes we've thought about larger co-op instances (ie raids) and wrt loot tables

RubenAlonzo

Any thoughts on player housing in the future or being able to mod our vehicles?

&gt;	Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;	We have thoughts - yes :) 

&gt;	Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;	I wub housing personally and we have a lot of ideas but first things first.

1. Will there be more Graphical option's... since the game was set for consol the pc version is so naked compared to other pc games.. so will we be getting more Options for graphics higher and lower end machines really want to know!

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Yes

Wyrdoli

Will it be possible for User created characters (assuming the name is not nonsense) to be able to enter the tv show in some form? either their deeds mentioned or even winning some kind of walk on part?

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Yes

AloneChief

1: What kind of new content can we expect in the future for Defiance? Since you released a season pass
2: There have been some complaints that the UI for the PC is a bit weird to get used to IF you don't play with a controller
3: One of your biggest selling points of the game is that it's connected to the TV series, fame or other? (I also hope we only get to see people with ""serious"" names in the series, not a person namned Trollface McGee)

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;1. 5 DLCs are planned
&gt;2. Yes you will
&gt;3. http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20130401 - you'll see it more in the future. Legally

i would like to see a radial menu for quick change loadouts for us console players would be very useful also i dont know if it is meant to be this way but i would like to have the opt to use the same grenade and shield mods on other loadouts as of now it wont let you

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;We'll be constantly improving usability of the UI

Amesiel

For a game like this

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;That isn't possible due to a number of policies and restrictions.

&gt;Technically it's no problem. You can connect with any client to the same Defiance server. It's how all our internal servers are set up for testing.

Jailbirdym

1) Any chance on pets or personal bots for our guys (or gals)?
2) Is there a time we could ""game with the Stars of the show""? (Nat and Lance excluded- lol)
3) Have you guys licensed a CCG or miniatures game yet?
4) Will you have more Holiday themed events in game?
 
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;1. Yes
&gt;2. Yes
&gt;3. Nope. 
&gt;4. Yes!

Legnirm

1. Is there going to be a Free Trial of the game 14 days or so
2. How big is Endgame PvE and how much and fast to you expect to expand it. Patch/DLC every month every 3 months or so. 
3. Guild Support is the main Feature in mmo's (imo). Do Guilds have ""levels"" Perks
 
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;1. Could certainly happen but I wouldn't wait for it.
&gt;2. It's about this big (---------------------------------------------------------------------)

&gt;We have 5 DLCs planned before Season 2 goes out.

&gt;3. No but they will have.

XxMeRcY_MaCaBrExX

Will there be any melee weapons released in the game.

&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;Melee weapons are some of the trickiest weapons to balance - they have to be good enough to get in close

Will be ever get to play as Dark Matter orget their vehicles? Perhaps even the awesome flying one?

I've had a gripe with the siphon nano effect and wanted to gather some communal discussion on it.  This discussion is going to have  bias against the nano effect and I can't help that, that the siphon nano effect is essentially deadlier than your run-of-the-mill shotgun cloakers.  Here's why:

* The siphon nano deals 463 damage on a proc, etcetera all seem to have virtually no effect.  If a perk were introduced to counteract this it would be much less of an issue, however that is currently not the case.
* Shotguns used to be the king of siphon effects with a high proc rate per pellet
* In comparison to the above point, but I've found a very large skew in the nano rates that doesn't ring balance.
* Siphon's damage output is vastly greater than any other nano effect save possibly radiation, it heals the user.
* Siphon has no falloff damage.  This is absurd.  Snipers are currently outclassed by anyone with a Tachmag because it's just so easy to spam the nano
* It's been said that nano effects were given a cap in PvP of proccing only *x* times per second

**TL;DR**, but some seem to have a far greater nano effect chance than should be allowed.  There is a problem here and the developers over at Trion have mentioned that they are balancing issues, but have given no insight into siphon work.  In conclusion, I do believe *all* of the nano effects should be reworked with the exception of bio, since it's right where it should be in tactical use.  Siphon, however, just feels like the highest priority.

If you haven't seen the final episode yet

So what we know so far: 

- Votanis Collective left their system to escape extinction.
- Arks left around 5000 years ago.
- After the events of the episode 12
  in the Gulanite mines under Defiance.
- We also find out that the Indogene have been looking for this ancient ship
  for about 3000 years.

Now onto my theory.

When the Votanis Collective were building the Arks, they were able to create an AI, and integrate it into a ship. What they then decided to do was use this ship as a unmanned drone to scout the galaxy for another habitable planet, that they could terraform. Once it was sent out the Indogene did not consider how quickly the AI would learn and adapt. It eventually, found a way to develop its own version of FTL, and then jumped away to complete it's mission. Eventually it found Earth, landed, and then waited until it was found.

Now 5000 years is a very long time to wait. As the AI waited it started to become more and more self-aware. Learning

In the meantime, but they knew which direction it was heading. They loaded up the ships, and lied to the Votanis Collective leaders and said they found a suitable planet to terraform, and they left.

The journey took about 5000 years to get from the VC planets to Earth. About 2000 years or so into it, the Ark Brains woke up an Indogene scientist to periodically check the signal, and try to find this ship. They eventually arrive at Earth, but it has been so long that life had evolved, and a civilization emerged. The AI ship had been buried under thousands or years of the planet's environment changing, and now there is a city interfering with the ships signal which has all but died out after being active for so long.

So, then who knows what it is capable of.

**TL;DR**  The ship under Defiance has a powerful AI that became self-aware

Following the premise that Arkfalls are actually pieces of the destroyed Ark ships falling to Earth bearing mutated life forms and technology

But why stop there? Why not use the new presentation to offer loot in a more immersive and interesting way?

1. Minor Arkfalls - Shown as a group of small ship pieces that players can loot like chests after completing.
1. Major Arkfalls - Shown as a large piece of ship that the mobs burst out of. After completion

The amount and quality of loot obtained from these lootable objects will depend on the player's performance during the event.

Example: out of 10 Ark pieces (Minor Arkfalls) or 10 lockers in the wreckage (Major Arkfalls), then 4/10 and finally 1/10.

* To make it even more interesting, 3, 6 and 8 (so three whites and one green) and a player getting only one spot might get 9 (one green).

* __Inventory size__: Is the size of your inventory tied to your ego rating? If so

* __Ammo/loot drops__: From playing different styles during arkfalls (attacking only the crystal vs. killing hellbug warriors and archers) I'm starting to suspect that to get an enemy to drop anything you have to have done at least some damage to it. So if I'm only attacking the crystal I often run out of ammo because nothing is dropping ammo since I'm not hitting any enemies. Is this correct?

* __XP__: Often after an arkfall or an ""emergency"" there's a whole bunch of XXX xp things that pop up really quickly. What are those? Is that the xp from the kills that are all given at once at the end?

* __Groups__: A few times now I've casually formed a group with someone out in the world. If I'm the group leader can he see any waypoints I set? If I trigger a mission they've already completed do they get the cut scenes too? Can they interact with the mission objectives to complete them?",self,t5_2siko,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1eg705/questions_about_progression_xp_and_loot/
1368657257.0,1eevwg,Cloud Ninety-Nine Pt.2 [Storytime!],Beastmister,11,2,1,"*Hey Ark Hunters

*To those of you who didn't catch [Part One](http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1dbucb/cloud_ninetynine_storytime/) of this story

*This is part two of Cloud Ninety-Nine, and a tag-along character I've recently developed a fondness for, Sade Fletcher.  Please let me know what you think of the story and I look forward to posting part three when it's ready!*

**Cloud Ninety-Nine

Wings buzzing louder than guns blaring, eyes darted from target to target as her feet made precision steps to avoid pools hazardous with unknown electronics.  She was a walking bull’s-eye, not faltering in her regime.  There was no parallel for just how mathematical the veteran became in the midst of combat.

Yet still, from chaotic to lethargic to just rampant and insane, but all underlings were led by a greater hive mind and that was the advantage Thaeya exploited most.  Her pistol continued to pierce chitinous armor by the second as she analyzed what exactly pushed savagery into this caste of enemy.

She hadn’t been targeted yet beyond her scratch, and soon enough the vehicle was clear enough for her to vault in and grab rifle and receiver.

Something was off about the attack.  She knew orders to give but not the reasons behind them.  Like any smart command the soldier followed her brain over her curiosity.  She clipped on her receiver and scrambled for the right broadcast channel.

“Staff Sergeant Clancy,” she called out to the static volume.  “Clancy, if you value your men here tell them to get the hell out of dodge.  Do not call ark patrol Foxtrot to the Golden Gate for assistance.  I repeat, do not send backup!”

In the midst of her warning Thae found herself a surprise of shattered glass done by one determined skitterling slamming her driver side window open.  The nuisance was quickly met with a bullet to the mouth

“This is Staff Sergeant Clancy of the EMC Overpass region

Critters flocked to her car like piranha to their prey.  In a nervous twitch the woman fumbled her rifle’s magazine while trying to load and watched in a blank stare as it fell beside the gas pedal.  She knew Clancy well enough that he wouldn’t be stupid.  And she knew well enough that today wasn’t the day for things to go wrong.  In a deep breath Thae snatched her gun’s clip and locked it in

“Listen to me Clancy, ripping into the metal like cloth.
Thaeya cursed them away in the Irathient fashion with a foul swing of her heavy Votan rifle

The channel’s low static cut silent after her harsh demands.  Clancy closed the broadcast without a reply which meant one of two things, and in the fog her rifle rained true to sundering claws and chitinous limbs alike.

Snipers that had moments before saved her from a nasty gouge now had wounds of their own.  It wasn’t easy to tell, but not simply executed.  Thaeya sprinted north to the nearest broken truck, finding a visual high point and rallying for attention.  

“Protect the humans

Pixelating into view from active camouflage, wrangle up these cattle and move!”

Sade Fletcher, flaring up in sharp fins.  Complete with renegade attire and four glaring metallic teeth of different hues, the Indogene didn’t particularly fit common expectance of her species.

“Hustle up, Sade caught attention of the flock but continued to bark orders for the sake of fun.

Like no time passed the entire group responded and understood her plan.  They gathered and marched in tow

“You sure know how to treat people like Pow
Flashing a multi-colour toothed smirk

“Without something big around to tell them what to do they sense threats and attack out of sync.  They’re not like a pride of Casti maulers

“And these ones were

Blazing lights from the front of the pack meant Thaeya’s precious car was riddled with holes before she had the time to drive it away.  The group hiked past, keeping in line but forcing a double take on the ruined machine and graveyard of skitterling bits surrounding it.

High beams slashed through the hazy field in a bright wave

Acidic pheromones flew at the clustered group

Blown away, and eradicated with the collective barrage the truck was soon left barren of alien invasion.  Barely scratched and still intact, hunters kept their weapons raised as they surrounded the military truck.  Everyone knew what the bugs were after by now but tension was still high because there was no answer as to why they acted in such a way.

Bravo team was nowhere to be seen

Unfortunately, she motioned for someone to get the driver’s attention and open it.

One rough and smug machinist took the liberty of stepping up to the driver side window for inspection.  Driver and passenger were inside

Mechanical hisses were the man’s last sounds as a bayonet cracked through armor

That’s when Thaeya’s backup plan followed through, caged in flawed wires and steel plating, it was difficult to discern if it even had a head with the iron labyrinth that took place of where one should be on a man. He leapt down in a weighty lurch, followed by nearly a dozen crazed Ninety-Niners with weapons raised in the back.  They were standing over the bodies of Clancy’s former Bravo team.

She had the same thing in mind as everyone else

The red metal hulk yelped some ungodly sound as pellets flattened against its skin.  It snatched an impromptu explosive from a bandolier strapped to its waist

“Chamber man

“Chamber man

“Feed them to the pet-things

What were they supposed to be used for? The only in-game clue is the combat pursuit [Stout Tactics III](http://www.defiancedata.com/pursuits.php?category=Combat) (and its predecessors). It gives the title ""Tank, you need level 10 in Bio Magnetic Guns and level 5 in Detonators. So I assume that the LMG is supposed to be the tanker/healer primary weapon?

That would explain why it's such a high recoil gun, I guess that's why it's okay that they take so long to reload? But, assuming they go through with their plan to normalize BMG damage, is there any reason why a tanker would prefer a Light Machine Gun to an Assault Rifle? Does the LMG cause knockback or make enemies flinch more often? Does it draw more aggro? Does it more reliably trigger secondary effects?

(**Please note:** The point of this thread is not to argue about how people use SAWs now and how awful it is that they're being nerfed.

1370844884.0,1g140o,Expanding The Grid: A Tentative Suggestion List to Perks,Beastmister,5,0,12,"Rawr Ark Hunters!

For a while I've been pondering about, it's got to change at some time right?  Maybe they'll just expand it, or maybe they'll rework the entire grid altogether, but either way I think it'd be staple to see some changes to put the niche in character development many of us are looking for.  I mean, of course, by implementing things more diverse than four powers and an array of perks.  Here's the idea:

**When the EGO Grid changes, Exclusives, and Ark Brains could be these new additives, each with their own unique niche role.  Fear my paint skills.**

* **Perks** as it stands now are what I call **Defiance Teal**.  This teal represents the basic passive ability that one would equip on their loadout screen.
* **Additives**, they would only be unlocked when a specific adjacent perk is unlocked that relates to the additive.  Then, up to three EGO Units (level up points) may be spent on the additive to further improve a specific factor of that perk.  [Here's a Picture example for an attribute to Assassin's Cache.](http://imgur.com/cgGyXgj)  Makes sense, right?
* **Exclusives**, but groupings of them.  If one exclusive adjacent to another is invested in by the player, then the adjacent exclusives become locked.  This could work to pair certain opposing perks together, in the means to allow a player to only choose one of them.  And to make things more complicated, yes, attributes should also be allowed to be exclusives.  [In this example, you see a pair of exclusives.  One is locked because the other is invested in.  The attribute related to the locked exclusive is, also locked.](http://imgur.com/3NdIPiH)
* **Ark Brains** which may be coded in **purple**, shadow war)*.  Before you go screaming omgimbalanced, chill, these are up-in-the-air theory bubbles, no popping.  Since Ark Brains aren't always active they may or may not be more powerful in relation to other perks.  Essentially though, they're for giving players an edge in the big open world brawls if they so choose to invest in it.  [This example shows an Ark Brain copy of Cellular Armor, called Infused Armor.  If the player so chose, and 6% outside areas of influence.](http://imgur.com/ApHXcSI)

That's essentially it, what kind of ideas would you have for these new additives to the grid?
