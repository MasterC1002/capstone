This Fear and Loathingesque recollection of the 2000 tour with Haujobb was snipped from http://www.velvetacidchrist.com/2010/09/13/flashback-5-twisted-vac-generator/:

The TTG tour in the usa. Many memories. I was a depressed wreck, cutting myself and drawing symbols with my blood and spitting on it, back stage in LA while so drunk on tequila. I was angry because these stupid, LA scene fucks invited themselves back stage while I was trying to meditate my stage fright away. I couldn’t focus because of them so I freaked out and started doing banishing rituals. Sure enough, they left. LOL. This was the show when Brian our merch guy from metropolis dressed up like a goat, went on stage, and molested me in front of the LA crowd. So embarrassing.

First of all, as this is a topic I frequently debate with people..

So, from my experience) confused fans that don't know/want to/bother to properly categorise their music, and spans multiple - usually unrelated - genres. It's starting to seem to me that as long as it's electronic and isn't fit for ""mainstream"", it becomes industrial, especially if there is some kind of distortion involved. How else would you explain that [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoFiIFkdAA), [Sickness of Snakes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDlyxRqO0s&amp;feature=related), [Moctan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28gg0v5__t4), [Haus Arafna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBNn6kNqFZI), [Whitehouse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gPEgLfyk-s) and [Coil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjhGXjSK4Ik) are all considered industrial, Chemlab

The reason I'm saying that it has become an umbrella term because of fans is that most of the newer ""industrial"" bands never really considered themselves as such. The best example is probably VNV Nation

So, that whenever you hear about a band playing, or meet someone that says he listens to, ""industrial music"", there is a big chance that it sounds nothing like your favorite ""industrial"" artist? Doesn't it make the whole genre completely meaningless, because it doesn't even define it's own sound, as it should? I know that there are other general genre tags, but I don't think that this argument has a case in such a small subculture..

I just went to an Industrial music festival

Virus synth (or something that sounded like a Virus synth)

4x4 bass kick for all songs

Distorted Vocals (All with similar distortion type

Performance:  Singer and someone playing keyboard and maybe a laptop

I really do like some of it, it's really kind of disappointing.


Is this music even considered Industrial or is this a new genre?  - A friend of mine was call it and it's fans ""Syntheic""  (The fans tended to be dressed the same as well:  Long fake colorful tubes and extentions in their hair


Edit:  So far a lot of great and insightful answers.  Seems like most of you here have the same taste in music as I do.  If you guys booked a show I would go to it!

1349656921.0,1142q0,Zombie Themed Industrial Album — Update 2,Ciemnika,12,2,5,"I've posted a couple times about a zombie themed dark electronic / industrial album I've been working on for a few months. I'm about nine out of eleven songs done at this point and had a short clip of a song I wanted to post up.

This one's a bit darkwave / EBM, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks!
