When I heard “I Put a Spell on You” and “Love Potion Number Nine” playing in back to back episodes I thought it was a hint for southern voodoo stuff. But doesn’t that fit a gypsy fortune telling carnival thing too? 

Then there was [this post]( https://twitter.com/AHStory/status/292344752634990592). Several cities? A carnival wouldn’t be rooted to one location

A carnival is a great set up for an ensemble cast

[This article]( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/american-horror-story-season-3-ryan-murphy_n_2501216.html) has some more hints and they work with a carnival too. Something lighter? Something glamorous? Something that can exist in different time periods?

Maybe we’ll get American Horror Story: Carnival

I don’t know if I’m on to something or if this is just a case of wishful thinking.

9. Kit's new wife, yet she's not involved in Kit's cancer treatment?

10. Kit's kids, they turned out great"" seriously? 

11. Adam Levine, so nothing would have even shown on the screen like we were all shown. 

I want to keep going and picking other shit apart, but after last night, they should have called it good after Spilt Milk, when Lana gave Threadson the finger, should have ended, we'd be left with as many unanswered questions, and wouldn't have had to sit through the forced, crap we were fed for the last 3 weeks.

&gt;“Kathy’s never [played] someone this bad,"" he said, adding, **""They did some real screwed up stuff in the 1800s.""**

Seems like a few clues.  I found this article on [prolific female serial killers](http://mentalfloss.com/article/20143/8-prolific-female-serial-killers) and this stood out

**1. DELPHINE LALAURIE**
**Estimated Body Count: **At least 10 (but possibly as many as 90)

**Story:** Delphine LaLaurie was the wife of a wealthy New Orleans physician in the early 1800s. With long black hair and porcelain skin, a fire ravaged the LaLaurie estate and after the firemen put out the flames, they smelled rotting bodies. Pushing open the attic door, they were startled to see dead slaves chained to the walls, a woman with her lips sewn shut, half-dead slaves in cages, a man who received a forced sex change, eviscerated slaves

**Capture:** The LaLauries escaped and were never seen again. Years later

**Punishment:** None

So what do you guys think?  This could also be a role for Jessica Lange as it does seem to have some of that ""glamour cat"" appeal Ryan Murphy mentioned.

A lot of people seem really upset that the aliens and their purposes haven't been explained and is kinda left ""open"". But isn't that kind of the point? We're talking about some species that is, if we were even capable of understanding them, may not even mean anything to us. To put it another way, their reasons are likely to be as alien as their origins.

On another note, that alone makes it all the more horrifying! Alma and Grace embodied that, in that there are two ways people can view abduction incidents. Grace thought it was an almost spiritual experience (and really, they brought her back to life so who could blame her?), while to Alma it was as horrific an experience as a person can go through, to the point of the idea of them returning driving her to murder. Grace claimed that they abducted them because of Kit and because he was ""special"", but is that a reason they themselves gave her or is that just conjecture on her part as a way to cope? There's no real evidence I've seen in the dialogue that either of them had any kind of dialogue WITH the aliens. The responses they had were solely their own responses to the situation.

Bloody Face--the arch-villain-- Specifically a killer and destroyer of women.

Arden--Has a literal virgin/whore complex, mutilates Shelly.

The Monsignor--Allows all kinds of horrors to go on in the asylum by overruling and dismissing Sister Jude (who is also pretty bad

Anne Frank's husband--Is pressured by society into mutilating and zombifying Anne/Charlotte to fit her into the terrifying Stepford wife mold.

Sister Jude--Sterilizes Grace against her will, and the other patients abusively. (Because a woman can be misogynistic, too.)

The aliens (or whatever they are)--Only interested in keeping/probing women for their specific reproductive purposes.


The bad stuff in the show clearly does NOT only affect women, and the male patients of Briarcliff have lots of bad shit happen to them as well. Everyone has lots of horror in American Horror Story! But it seems like an unusual amount of the evil people in this season have the roots of their neuroses in true hatred for women.

Moira herself explains the age discrepancy: Women see who she really is (an old soul); men see what they want to see (a sex object).

The first to be abducted that we've seen was Alma, Pepper has Grace's brain, and Alma has Pepper's brain.

Evidence:

- Grace mentions that they're not perfect.

- Pepper suddenly is much more coherent as we've all noted.

- Pepper's claim that her brother in law killed her child is basically the same as Grace's claim about her crime.

- Grace screamed when she saw Alma in the water

-  We have yet to hear Alma speak after she is now back.

- We know Grace gets angry in the next episode but it may be because of this.

But I thought it'd be fun to start hearing everyone's ideas on what Season 3 might entail. I know Ryan Murphy already said he was going to hide a clue in the finale, and I have a feeling he has planted other clues.


Here's my theory for those who are interested: I think Season 3 could be set in New Orleans, and it was a major time for VooDoo, Black Magic etc.  The only reason why I think this is because of the seemingly random references to France/French Culture in this season.  All I've noticed so far are: the song ""Dominique,"" the fact that Grace was from France and spoke French even though she grew up on a midwestern farm, and when Thredson was making Lana a ""Croque Monsieur"" in the doom basement.  To me, the French things just seem out of place for Boston in the '60s, so I have a feeling they are put there on purpose.

""WTF?"" you may ask.


Ladies and gentleman of /r/AmericanHorrorStory I present, bookending a very memorable dance number. It's significance? Well beyond playing the episode’s namesake 'The Name Game' song, it also clearly displayed in bold, white lettering the word CONGRESS. ""Pfft, but that's just the name of the record label"" you scoff. Maybe so my friends, maybe so. But between these two seasons, during these many episodes of AHS I have learnt one very important lesson - no detail is too small


Having said that, praying fervently. Not an implausible scenario by any stretch of the imagination but what exactly is he uttering? It’s the ['Armor of God'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_of_God) - a completely appropriate piece of scripture to recite when preparing yourself to go into battle with evil. Now here's where it gets interesting; Sister Mary Eunice enters, joins in the recitation, eventually taking over from the Monsignor 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, rulers of this world and wickedness in high places... Hmmm.


There has been much talk of Rome and the Monsignor’s ambition to rise through the hierarchy of the Church/Vatican could this possibly carry over into next season? Being that it’s unlikely AHS would go overseas to Rome


Which brings me to Exhibit C. an [interview in which Ryan Murphy](http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/01/03/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-the-name-game-exclusive/) in which he states he wants to do something with a bit more ‘evil glamour’ this season including another Romeo &amp; Juliet type storyline and is contemplating shooting it in a place in the country where true horror has been. I believe the political climate of Washington lends itself nicely to all the above criteria: the glamorous yet scandalous times of Kennedy’s Camelot, incompetence and corruption have the capacity to devastate and even destroy lives, potentially on a mass scale. And we all know Murphy loves to grind a political axe or two. 


In summation (TL;DR) an AHS set in Washington DC opens up the potential for a season 3 filled with conspiracy theories, sacrifices, murder, Faustian bargains, greed, decadence, power struggles, lust

So I watched AHS, but I finished in time for Coven, which is good enough for me!

Like any normal human being, and I'm instantly bias and defensive.

With that said

Yes, but simultaneously in the same universe there are higher intelligence beings (e.g. aliens) what power does the aforementioned hold over the latter? Obviously not much. So I thought that was a little interesting to mull over throughout.

**Sister Mary Eunice**: Anyone else a little pissed that that was it for Sis ME and Satan? After all her badassery and how weak Monsignor Timothy was and continued to be

**Grace and Alma**: Grace was the single link to the aliens that intrigued me (aside from what I said earlier). She had a connection and seemed to know where to go with it, we abduct her for the majority of the season, bring her back, have her kill Grace, and send her to Briarcliff to *die*.

**Kit Walker**: aliens like and want him... why's that again?

**Lana Winters**: An ultimate evil bad guy. A very intelligent and great character, but I didn't feel enough satisfaction as to why she was like that? 

These are just a few things I felt like pointing out. None of this ruined a single thing about the series for me. Great season! Good stuff :)

I was confused as to what the writing actually said, the written letters are definitely ""Shin"" ""Chet"" ""Tet"". 

Shachat means ""destroyer"" (""shochet"" is butcher in Hebrew

Interesting points about Shachat and the character in the show:
In the Jewish tradition, in Exodus. The actual character Shachat in the show seems to be an amalgamation of many kinds of angels of death/destruction (foremost among which are Malachei HaMavet, literally ""Angels of Death"", mentioned in various parts of the Tanach as well as the Mishnah, Talmud, and various Kabbalistic tracts.) With death angels, there are some things traditionally to keep in mind:
a) the soul escapes from the mouth
b) traditionally, like a kosher butcher. so even though she isn't using the sword here, she *is* showing some of that mercy
c) using the kiss instead of the sword, makes sense because angels of death in the tradition take whatever form best suits their needs. though i think this could have been played with more (ie, she could appear to each person as the most calming figure in their lives), i get why they kept with just one actress. 

What I find interesting is the name, immovable force. It will literally kill anything in its path that is not marked with the blood. it sees no difference between the egyptian and the jew, which is why the jews were commanded so vehemently to put the blood up on their houses. There are Midrashim that talk about Jews who didn't think it was such a big deal who didn't put blood on their houses and got straight up firstborn KO'd by the indifferent death ghost. What this says about the character is interesting: while she has the element of mercy mentioned above, she also has the complete, almost cruel indifference of death itself. In Judaism by and large, angels are not friends to humans: though they do show favor on the occasional patriarch or righteous man, they are generally disdainful/resentful of humankind, Christian angels are usually more loving to humans (actually

There was an actual horrific asylum on the east coast called Willowbrook run by the church in the 60s that had deplorable conditions and there was a real life tv expose on it (that Lana's expose looks VERY similar to) that got the place shut down. After the place was shut down it became the home of a Staten Island urban legend about an inmate called 'Cropsey' that is synonymous with the Bogeyman. 

The other big similarity is that there is a serial killer

The documentary is on Netflix and I'd highly recommend it! Especially if you found the setting and story of season 2 intriguing.

My best guess so far with all I've learned is that it might be set on a plantation in Louisiana - it's the only thing that covers all the different clues we've picked up this season.

I'm really thinking we've got it nailed with the Louisiana voodoo theme.  I think the clue was ""I Put A Spell On You"".  Also

While I found this season to be a lot more brutal and a hell of a lot creepier (as well as getting away from the baby craziness that made me rather nauseous throughout the first season) I found that it was a lot messier. After all, creepy *the Hills Have Eyes* creatures running around in the woods, a serial killer, corruption in the church... And it felt like so much of it was left unresolved or it was resolved in a way that was anti-climatic. 

After all

The serial killer plotline was honestly probably the one I liked the best and that seemed to have the best ending and honestly everything else could have been really toned down (maybe with the exception of Arden's experiment although I felt like his Nazi history was brought up as a major plot point and never really dealt with which was also frustrating.)

She doesn't deny anything to the Mexican woman who sees her for what she is.  Then she gets on Sister Jude's case with the lipstick.  Then Dr. Arden.  Then she's watching the Christians die with glee.  

The point I took from that, she is simply doing her evil thing.

So, Sister Jude wakes up and says ""They saw it too?!"".   

Sister Mary Eunice, sister?"".

To me, he might have teased Sister Jude more, or dropped a hint to her fate, or done something mean spirited, the way he'd been doing all episode.

In the commercial for AHS where it shows all of the characters, overlooking Tate on the mural on the wall, is a demonic type figure. In hindsight, this makes total sense of why the demon would be overlooking Tate seeing that he has graced Vivian with the anti-Christ.

Also

I wonder if Tate being fixed in the mural underneath the wallpaper has anything to do with earlier in the season when Vivian is peeling off the wallpaper to show the mural, I find it ironic that she would state a mural with her sons face on it with a demon (presumably the Devil) overlooking him is beautiful given her Christian faith.

In love takes pride

To be silent

Learn from at the right time

Hide his evil smile

And I thought walking

I knew from that time

If my heart is desperate

He did not see me cry will


A refrain ran into the street

Jostling passers

Who slipped into the crowd

From a small air engaging

I was on its way

He stopped in front of me

And told me to be wise

""You're sad

Come and enter my song

There are beautiful boys ...

Throw your grief in the stream

And turns her back ... ""


We need your verse is gay

So let's talk in May

Trees in lilac dress

And was pushing heap

Y violets

An old poet sings a song

My dress is stained sun

I care for my awakenings


A refrain ran into the street

Jostling passers

Who slipped into the crowd

From a small air engaging

People on the move

Looked surprised look

Ceased their chatter

""What is this ill-mannered?""

Yes

And engaging words

And most importantly

Laughter at close range ...


If this air running in the street

Can chase your troubles

Then enter in the crowd

Y instead of pushing ...

**Moira**: Died just about as powerlessly as one can. She was being raped and then another woman,  as long as she is getting her own way, but is compelled by men (who she fears deep down) and Constance in particular (because Constance murdered her).

**Tate**:  I think since he essentially committed suicide (by cop, possibly because he didn't want anything from them or feel any connection to them. I also think that Tate wasn't in control of himself when he did the shootings and that is why he doesn't remember them, except in flashes. (inconsistency I noticed: the goth-y victim says he asked her if she believed in god, but during the playback of it, you can't hear him say anything, and in fact there doesn't seem to be enough time for any communication between them).

**Chad and Patrick**: These guys are also fairly trapped in their pre-death emotions. Chad is ONLY concerned with getting the house to look just right

**Nora and Charles**: We haven't seen Charles yet, she had just fulfilled his desire to be seen as a competent man. Nora, in choosing to die, remains somewhat outside of the house's power, like Tate does. She did feel guilty though about all those abortions, and so is intent on helping Vivienne (and by extension her family). Also, I think that the Infantata is the cause of all of it

**The ginger twins**: They died causing trouble

**Beau**: My opinion (we don't have too much to go on here) is that he was good natured in life, and is also too simple to be angry about it, and (I think) too simple for the house to use him for anything much. I don't think the time he appeared to Violet, that he was trying to scare her, I think he was trying to play with her now that Addy is gone.

Many of the theories I have seen about **Rubber Man** also work into this: If he died having sex, it could totally be pre-death **Rubber Man**.

**The nurses**: Died afraid and unknowing

**Hayden** was completely obsessed with pregnancies before she died

**The murder enthusiasts**: I think they pretty much got what they wanted

So I was pretty disappointed last night, but a friend of mine who didn't even know wtf reddit was (for shame!) was talking with me about how the quote was just dumb...then it hit me: The dude is OBSESSED with plants. From his introduction, he has always had plants/interacted with plants at some point.  

The first time we meet Dr. Arden, dude's got to move on to humans,"" at first, which I don't think is totally false, but I didn't think of plants with human features.  Anyhow, he has a deep attachment to the woods, and something living there that was being fed, mainly because I figured he was feeding ""Bloody Face.""

But then it hit me hard when I was ranting about ""Mossy Banks.""  Dude has a CRAZY obsession with the woods, he goes OFF on her for it.  Why?  I think because he doesn't want her to find the plant man; the ""Tree of Life,"" if you will. This is where things get a little odd, but bear with me.  

So last night in the discussion thread,"" and the Dr. is supposed to symbolize the snake from the bible.  I thought it was a stretch at first, until i took into account how he had to persuade her to take a bite against the sister's wishes.  Anyhow, the Mossy Banks quote comes into play because the dude is just insane about plants.  What's in the woods is a plant/human hybrid, or maybe just the tree itself.  It would make sense that if they pay homage to possession/demon movies that they would have SOME evil dead in there.  What if the reason he is trying to keep her away is because he doesn't want her attacked, a la chick from The Evil Dead, but fed her fruit from the tree to ""open her eyes, the possessed kid shows up and wreaks havok

This may also tie the aliens from the first episode in as well.  They are doing experiments on Kit of some sort, which is why the doctor is so keen on getting inside his head and experimenting on him?

I dunno, because the Dr. guy is just obsessed with them and whatever is in the forest, and fruit. Those are clues, and this is the only way I can work it out.

Holy hell, so I thought we could put what we know in one place.  Please feel free to add to this list so we can help clarify for some newbies or whoever.


* People who died in the murder house stay there.  It doesn't matter if your bones are there


* You can't leave the house if you died there.  Violet magically disappeared from the car when Ben drove off because she is dead and stuck there.  If you see people outside the house (including at Constance's house) they're not dead.

 
* There is one exception to the above rule.  The ghosts can leave on Halloween!  Apparently other ghosts can roam the earth on Halloween too, or Moira with her dying mom), this doesn't mean ghosts can leave the house all the time.  It was just the Halloween episode.


* There's no confirmation about why some ghosts show their murder injuries and some don't


* The monster in the basement is Thaddeus, but he had a taste for blood and now he slices up people who come into the basement with his teeth and claws.


* The sweet disfigured guy in the attic with the red ball is Beauregard (Beau)


* Constance isn't dead.  She's been off the property numerous times and is therefore not a murder house ghost.


* It's unclear why we can see Moira as both young and old, he suddenly realized that Moira wasn't young and hot after all.

* Tate is rubberman.  He put the suit on to rape Vivian in order to give Nora a baby.  Nora was protective and motherly to him as a child and he wants to give her what she wants.

1359446846.0,17hj9q,For those who wanted to read my analysis of Season 1.,alucidexit,27,13,11,"""You're gonna regret it!""

I have to admit, and Ben Harmon is left alone in the house to deal with the prospect of having to raise the demon kid on his own. Manipulative Constance has stolen the demon kid, and desires to raise him herself while a devious Hayden plans to steal the child.

Previews contained various hints that there was some universal truth that was still unbeknownst to the audience. Mainly

Within the first thirty minutes, and mistakes coming back to haunt you, and while we got this via a very anticlimactic murder scene with Hayden, BEN ENDS UP HAPPY. What message does this leave us with? It left me with: Death solves everything since after Vivien died, bygones were just bygones, and they went back to being a happy family. 

This episode should have peaked with Ben Harmon's fate. Ben Harmon's fate should have been the climax of this episode, this scene would have made a lot more sense had we previously seen these guys conspiring together). They attack Ben and hang him from the ceiling. I could deal with this, though. It may have been disappointing, but it wasn't a deal breaker... perhaps the episode has more in store for us...

Constance somehow regains the child from Hayden when Travis slits Hayden's throat (even though she's already dead). Not sure how this makes much sense other than a cruddy plot point to have Constance get the kid back from Hayden. I was expecting a bit more of a power struggle here. This baby has been the bargaining point for almost every ghost, it was difficult to grasp exactly what just happened. 

Almost instantly a new family moves in and we are treated to deja vu as the new family goes through similar motions as the Harmon's. When the new husband started sleep walking to the kitchen, because Larry sleep walked, and that was before Loraine killed herself, so that doesn't really make much sense to me.

One of the reasons why this episode was so polarizing is because it was such a shift in tone from the rest of the season. I, but never learns. He's blinded by his grounding in ""reality"" to see truth. The series was moving in a tragic direction. Instead, we got Beetlejuice. 

Yes, they don't do a sequence where they're all together in the afterlife, because it's meant to end on a tragic note, and this is why I was against Ben Harmon dying in the first place. It's much more torturous if he doesn't get to be with his family.

Did anyone else think this show was going to move into a plotline about freeing the ghosts? This was somewhat touched upon with Moira and the medium. Moira mentions in one of the earlier episodes that she wishes for her body to be dug up so her spirit can be free, but it doesn't work. I was really hoping the show would have touched upon this. Mainly, because I really want to see Moira's tired soul get some rest, but also because I feel it would have made for a much more compelling finale, involving all the ghosts in a much more direct way.

Imagine, Ben, Moira, Chad, and Patrick on one side (I put Chad and Patrick on here, because at this point in the series, it seems they do not wish to spend eternity with one another), so it's not perfect

Everything at the beginning of the episode is the same right before Ben's death. Hayden comes to kill Ben, and runs down the stairs of the house. Moira is waiting outside. Moira informs Ben that if he wants to save his family, he needs to make the ultimate sacrifice: He has to return to the house, unearth the bodies, and burn the house to the ground, freeing all the spirits including his wife and daughter. 

At first

Chad and Patrick hug, they weren't soul mates. 

Moira's mother appears behind her

Nora comes to her revelation that she's not fit for motherhood

Vivien would finally forgive Ben for everything, and Tate would come to some understanding that he will now suffer in the afterlife for his crimes, and that he hopes when he's done suffering, that they can be together. The three of them disappear, and Ben is left crying in front of the burning house.

Constance appears from behind, leaving him to burn. She could make it look like a suicide or arson to cover her name. 

In the process, and takes the baby for her own. As she walks away from the fire, scarred, she carries the baby in one arm, and smiles before it cuts to black.

I think that would have made for a much better ending

Nora has her exit wound, and all the teenagers Tate gunned down had their original wounds.

My theory is, they are dead, they are able to see themselves and manifest without their wounds.

With season 3 coming up I thought I'd attempt to spark debate with the idea of Female Empowerment as a central theme of the show (indeed a theme that seems to run through all of Murphy's shows). The show has repeatedly used the idea of feminism and male dominance as a theme to show struggle.

With the announcement that season 3 will be about 'female empowerment' one has to wonder just what the creators themselves thought the first 2 seasons were about. Will we get exhausted with it? Will it be even more blatant and obvious this year? Will it be spun slightly differently? Do you like what Murphy does with all this? Do you hate it?

Since then, a new family in the same house, or backstories of the house itself - or if the show may lose its formula by continuing down this line.

I have the personal opinion that a new start could keep the show fresh and keep the nice slow reveal formula intact. So here I am

Here are my ideas:

* Inmates in a haunted prison - It doesn't necessarily have to be a family, which inmates are ghosts and which ones are alive, corruption with guards and wardens, etc. The fact that Larry has been transferred to a prison could be a season tie-in.

* Hospital - Same as the above, even.

* Possession - Could be anywhere, and the show seems to follow classic horror stories. Exorcisms are pretty big in the horror category too.

I'm sure there are plenty of other ideas. These are just the ones I had sitting in my head

* Violet: she's dead. She died when when she took the pills and she is now a ghost like Tate. I got this from the fact that she started seeing the other spirits after and Tate told her that she can see them now because she is ""evolved"" like Tate. Also she hasn't been to school in two weeks because she cannot leave the house. 

* Nora's husband: is the spirit that is possessing Tate. He wants to give her a baby and he did something to the house that won't let spirits die when he brought their baby back to life. Nora told him she tried to kill the baby and couldn't...it was already dead like Tate is. Also he killed the gay couple because they couldn't have his baby for Nora. Also Nora and Tate get along so well when he is possessed (like when he killed the gay people) because he is her husband and she knows that on some level.

-The new baby is the antichrist.

-This makes Tate the devil incarnate.

-Tate was once a normal kid. Then

-Tate has been manipulating Violet the entire time.

-The house is divided between those who want to bring on the ""end times"" with the baby

-The ""stillborn"" baby is actually still alive and being cared for by the ghosts who don't want the evil baby to bring on the apocalypse.

-The two babies will grow up and eventually have an epic battle of good and evil.

-Season 2 will continue with a new family in the house and everyone trying to convince/manipulate them into either helping bring on the apocalypse or helping to stop it.

If seeing your body is a prerequisite for ghosts to be able to leave the house


Why is it that some ghosts don't know that they're dead? While others seem to know instantly?  Does it have anything to do with how they died? 


Why did Moira continue to age while the others have not?  Why has she aged so rapidly also? If she was in her early 20's in the early 80's why does she look like she's in her late 60's? 


Constance summoned the ""burn man"" in the attic when she needed to talk to him. This made me think he was a ghost. But apparently he has his own apartment and can be thrown in jail.  So is he a ghost?

1323342583.0,n4pwz,About the wounds.. [has spoilers if you haven't watched the Smoldering Children],Erinjb,11,2,16,"I know it is a popular theory in the subreddit (and pretty much anywhere people are talking about the show)

An inordinate amount of people apparently die from torso wounds or essentially asphyxiation in that house. Those two deaths wouldn't show the wounds when everyone is clothed

List of characters who have died from chest wounds/asphixiation:

* Chad (Shot in the heart)
* Patrick (Shot all over the torso after taking a major beating)
* Beau (Suffocated)
* Tate (Shot in the torso)
* Violet (Pill overdose)
* Hugo (Shot in the torso)
* Travis (Stabbed in the torso)
* Bianca (Murder House crazy patient
* Elizabeth Short (asphyxiation from nitrous oxide

Those who have died by a visible (usually head) wound:

* Moira (Shot in the eye)
* Hayden (Beaten with a shovel)
* Gladys (who asphyxiation by drowning and still awkwardly shows up soaking wet.)
* Maria (stabbed in the torso
* Fiona and Dallas (throats slit)
* Nora Montgomery (shot herself through the head)
* Charles Montgomery (shot in the head)
* Bryan and Troy (Clawed to shit by Thaddeus[?])
* Tate's victims from the school shooting
* Thaddeus the basement monster (?)
* Larry's wife and daughters (Burned)

People who are clearly cognizant of their status:

* Chad
* Patrick
* Moira
* Maria and Gladys
* Hayden
* Travis
* Larry's family
* Tate's victims

People recently made aware of their status:

* Tate (maybe)
* Violet
* Elizabeth Short

People who don't realize they are dead:

* Nora Montgomery
* Beau
* Bryan and Troy


I really don't think the ghosts awareness of their status has anything to do with the visibility of wounds. Feel free to argue.",self,t5_2spug,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/n4pwz/about_the_wounds_has_spoilers_if_you_havent/
