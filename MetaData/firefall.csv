1375541537.0,1jmm6r,A Firefall lament.,BrainKatana,73,11,96,"I think this is necessary to write up because I've seen echoes of it from the newer open beta players both in-game and on this subreddit. I started this as a reply to another thread

The game as it was 8 months ago was,"" this is simply the truth. Here's why:

* Battleframe progression was a tech tree where you actually unlocked things like better weapon variants, and servos. It added tangible feeling of progression, not to mention providing a wider variety of base stat allocations to choose from that affected the ""direction"" of the weapon wen you crafted an improved version. Want a rifle that is ""biased"" to increase its damage when you craft it? Unlock the Astrek version. Want a bigger clip size? Grab Omnidyne-M. Instead of being scrapped, this system could have been combined with the constraint system in a much more interesting way than the current ""unlock the colored box"" system that is on the frame progression screen.

* Even though there were fewer ARES mission types

* Chosen attacks on towers and outposts happened more often. I saw in the patch notes that this was recently increased again, and small game world.

* You could bring crafted gear and custom frame setups into PvP. They removed it in the name of ""balance

* All PvP gametypes are rehashed UT/Quake gametypes. Even Jetball is just Bombing Run. In a game where they have decent, **and** an infrastructure to support high-speed player/AI/player interaction, it's disappointing that they haven't created a more ambitious and unique PvP gametype.

* Permanent item loss is psychologically punishing. It makes every fun thing in the game slightly less so, high quality competition, all of which have taken decent lateral development strides in the last 6 months. For the curious, those games are: Warframe, Blacklight Retribution, Wildstar (still in super CB), and Planetside 2

* There are other, and the earning side of the economy isn't strangled by every player mining asteroids (resource gathering).

* UI modding is cool, potentially putting your computer at risk for malware, and (based on the sites I've seen used to distribute even the most-recommended mods) *definitely* at risk for adware and spyware.

* Finally, extremely defensive about the game and treat anyone with any complaint very poorly instead of attempting to have a constructive discussion. The game population in my experience is, on a scale of WoW Barrens to your best friend, somewhere around a pack of rabid coyotes. It's practically impossible to get a straight answer or discussion from anyone, even if it's about a brand new feature that came in with the latest patch. IMO, if Red5 doesn't run the game into the ground with hardcore features and an overall lack of polish and content, a community of immovable, especially if those new players approach them in any state of frustration.

So, and to get it out there for others to see, so they know what they could be getting into if they choose to pick up one of the Open Beta Starter Packs. For the record, I've been playing the game for almost a year, and I purchased the $100 founders pack because I was convinced the game had upward momentum. Now, I'm not so sure.",,self,Medic,

1339711696.0,v2eg8,Firefall Milestone Update - HUGE changes in the works,JBWill,41,0,19,"Phobos posted this [here](http://www.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/milestone-update-june-14th-2012.43535).  Copied and pasted for those without beta forum access:

""Hey all

As you may remember, I wanted to give you all an update on where we're at with the milestone and talk about some of the features that have been implemented so far. I will try to break out the update by major feature. As always, please remember that there are multiple teams working on multiple aspects of the game. No single feature set is getting the entire focus of the staff.

*Disclaimer: Any or all of this can change at any time. We iterate on designs a lot and I highly expect a lot of this to change as we play test and get feedback from the team.*

**New PvP TDM Map**

The team working on the new TDM map has gotten everything blocked out. We've had multiple internal playtests and the map is getting high ratings on the fun scale. At this point the team has moved on to changing the map from blocked out props to fully artified assets. This process will take a while as there are custom pieces that need to be modeled out

As a side note

**Core Combat Team**

The Core Combat team has been busy prototyping all the features they want in the game. By the end of this week

-Animated hit boxes that match player shapes (arms, etc).

-Added new Assault primary weapon, direct hit bonuses.

-Engineer primary weapon is now a Tesla Rifle

-Engineer abilities are now more trap-based leading to smaller

-The Medic heal gun has been removed for a projectile-based weapon that either heals friendlies or damages enemies. It also stacks a damage vulnerability debuff on the target. +10% damage taken per hit landed

-The Dreadnaught HMG now has damage degradation past 20 meters, reduced damage per round.

-The Recon sniper rifle has been changed to a charge-up sniper rifle. It charges while scoped and deals more damage based on charge percentage.

This is just a small sample of the changes. The vast majority of abilities have been changed, health values, etc.

**Crafting and Resource Team**

The crafting and resource team have finalized what resources will be available along with what each resource will do to equipment crafted with that item. This requires completely rebuilding the way we create equipment and has been a huge task for both the crafting team and the backend development team to make this system as dynamic as it needs to be. Now that this is finalized

**Battleframe Tiers &amp; Constraints Team**

Players no longer level up as they gain experience. Experience is now stored on a per-battleframe basis and can then be spent to unlock technology. The constraints system has been finalized to use three constraints; weight, but take CPU and power. Backpacks provide power, but take CPU and weight. Battleframe servos provide CPU, but take power and weight. Abilities and modules require a mixture of all constraints. This provides a fairly complex system with a lot of room for customization. You really have to consider each and every thing you put on your battleframe.

The certificate system that you'll spend XP on is being built out along with the battleframe garage where you'll modify all your equipment (this replaces the Loadout Modification Station and player inventory). For right now, abilities, etc. that a player would want.

**eSports &amp; Matchmaking Team**

We've been able to implement open world duels in a one on one or squad on squad setup. We've also implemented the ability to challenge a full squad to a match on Sunken Harbor pitting team vs team in a private match. We've developed the ability to watch live and prerecorded PvP matches from inside the client. We've implemented the spectator mode and continue to improve the functionality for both casual observers as well as broadcasters that are looking for more advanced functionality. We have some cool stuff to show there

We are working on matchmaking within a tier to use player-skill to determine matchups while also taking into consideration squads of all sizes. We have also implemented a deferred rewards system meaning that you only receive the XP and loot rewards at the end of a match

**Character Customization**

Lots of work is being done to open up our system to allow for more character customization like new hair styles, but will get really exciting once we have the store front online.

**Open World Dynamic Missions**

We've rewritten the Chosen invasion code so that it works in the new system and allows for capture and recapture of cities. Work is now being done to make the entire war front more dynamic where you really have to pay attention to incursions and Chosen patrols in order to prevent these attacks. We've also done work on Thumper encounters to make them more dynamic and less predictable. In combination with the new resources you'll be hunting for

**Trans Hub**

Trans Hub is going through some revitalization and missions are being added around the area to tell more of the story. Still a lot of work to do here

And much much more. There are multiple smaller teams that are working on stuff behind the scenes and even more work that is being done on off-hours from some really passionate people to make sure that we are making a kick-ass game. We still have a long ways to go and will probably be taking extra time to make sure to iterate on some of these designs before we get to the point where we're ready to release it.

Aggro. It is the basis of all thumping. In laymen's terms

However, for example, usually takes two good grenade launcher shots) will make them switch aggro onto you.

""But Timmy"" some will ask

Here's why getting all the aggro for yourself is a good thing: 

**You can move and sustain. You can jet into the air, heal, etc.**

**Your thumper can do none of these things. It is completely at the mercy of any mob that gets close enough to hurt it

The trap I see many new players falling into is trying to apply as much dps as possible to the threatening enemies until they're dead. This is not the way to thump.

You must only apply as much dps as it takes to draw aggro onto yourself. One stock battleframe with no mobility abilities can indefinitely dodge 5 terrorclaws' attacks with decent skill

The damage required to gain aggro is less than a 10th that is required to kill something, spam AOE on the horde chasing you.

Have fun!

1. open your battleframe garage

**NOTE: for accord biotech

4. select your aftermarket frame of the SAME CLASS  (biotech -&gt; recluse or dragonfly  etc etc)

5. click the chest

go nuts!  Also


NOTE: if you dont see them after unequipping your T1 (accord) battleframes, if that doesnt work log out then back in.

Here's what I take from the info:

* Unlocking as many frames as you can before 03/22 might be a good idea.
* XP may be more useful than resources from now until 03/22
* Crafted gear is now less valuable than resources until 03/22
* It'll be open season on crafting for a while after 03/22

1. After you do the tutorial quest that shows you how to switch your frame
2. The 'c' key brings up the drop-down menu, but I missed it cause I was in combat).
3. Crystite is basically cash. It drops from everything and you use it to buy stuff (including T2 frames which are expensive).
4. The other minerals are used for crafting
5. Battleframe garages and stations are located at almost every base. Molecular printers (where you do crafting) are harder to find
6. You can look at the tech tree
7. To start using a different piece of equipment (like something unlocked via the tech tree)
8. Before you go out into the world
9. The map can show elevation/mountains if you zoom in. Try to go around the mountains instead of over them. :)

My main issue with Firefall is it's slow learning curve. Everything you do in the game is fairly easy to do

Examples of things they don't explain to you how to do:    
Add friends, how do I see at night (or turn on my flashlight), how do I equip X, I unlocked Tier 2 how do I equip it, do any of my abilities or exp move over when I unlock Tier 2, how do I call down a thumper, that you can/have to switch between options for the 4th ability (scanhammer/thumper/et al), how do I scroll through the chat box to see older messages (still don't know how to do this)?

And these are just things off the top of my head. Even after the patch where they made these things easier to do

Many of these things could easily be taught through quests or tutorials. The first time it gets dark if there was a tutorial box that popped up and said ""Hey it's dark you should try out your flash light by pressing X"" and didn't go away until you used your flashlight that'd be great! 

If people don't like these tutorial boxes popping up and cluttering their screen they could turn them off in the options. 

**TL;DR** Many things in the game aren't obvious how to do them

**Edit:** [no-tec informed us](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/y4rth/does_firefall_need_more_tutorials/c5sh5xn) that they're very aware of this. From a Dev's perspective it's smart to do tutorials last,False,self,t5_2s629,1344877156.0,,Engineer,t3_y4rth

1373660961.0,1i6dsa,Opinion on the game as it currently is.,JetpackKoala,32,7,66,"So, and the game as a whole is very addictive. There are downsides to the game being in beta naturally, things like that. But those are really expected I think. There are two things however that are really bothering me as a player right now

1. The fact that the gear i spend so much time and effort crafting, its also something a lot of people don't know. Is there really a point to this? I mean, lets think about it this way. There are currently 15 battleframes. All of which require different gear and items and weapons etc. I very seriously doubt anyone will solely play nothing but one frame indefinably. People will be playing multiple different frames. However... due to the way repair pools decay ,  It would push me to sit on one frame and play it forever. I mean, you'll craft your item, just so you can use that item, to gather the mats you'll need to craft it again. It makes no sense to me

2. The world seems dead to me. Let me explain what I mean. It's quiet. Too quiet. In every other mmo I have ever played, or full release. Chat is very active. Now, I'm not saying its always positive, a lot of the time its negative and spammy. But the chat in firefall is dead. And it makes the world feel very empty to me, especially when I'm playing alone, running across the map and not seeing a single other player because there is no reason to be anywhere  where there isn't a event happening. If i pop in and none of my friends are on, I feel like im playing a single player game. No one chats at all unless its to ask a quick question about one of the many mechanics that the game fails to explain. I really don't understand why it is that way. What is keeping people from being social in this game? Especially considering how often you have to play with other players. I can't even find a squad most of the time because when I ask, especially because of how nice of a community the game has.

There are now **5 primary types of minerals** in Firefall. Every primary mineral has **3 subtypes**

**Bio-Organic/Bioactive**

* Compounds (POW)
* Stintgel (MASS)
* Smartgel (CPU)

**Carbon**

* Energized (POW)
* Composites (MASS)
* Electroactive (CPU)

**Ceramic**

* Dialectrics (POW)
* Composites (MASS)
* Insulators (CPU)

**Metals**

* Conductive (POW)
* Hi-Tensile (MASS)
* Computational (CPU)

**Polymers**

* Conductive (POW)
* Hi-Strength (MASS)
* Electroactive (CPU)

So, you'll get 2 main bits of info: 

1. What primary type of material you need (Ceramics)
2. What subtype will yield the best results

Naturally

**Quality Level**

Quality Level (QL, assuming you can get enough, it's may be better to use the mineral with the higher stat value instead of the ""primary stat"" mineral, but you might run into higher constraints because of this. It's also worth noting that a given mineral's QL is always the value of its primary stat, with it's secondary and tertiary stats coming in a 66% and 33% of its QL, respectively.

**Purity and Refining**

Thumped minerals are ""raw"" and must be refined. Mineral purity is a 1000 point scale of the conversion ratio from ""Raw"" to ""Refined.""  At 0 Purity, and their purity level is 500, when you refine them you will get 75 Ceramic Insulators.  The time-to-refine is dependent upon how much of the mineral you are refining, at 1 second per-resource (60 resources per-minute).

That's pretty much it. Happy Thumping!

*Disclaimer:* I can't guarantee how long this information will be correct or close to it. Also, and how much patience it requires to learn what everything in the new system is and how it relates to what you are unlocking on your BattleFrame.  This crafting system strikes a huge blow to any kind of successful player onboarding, which is incredibly important during the early stages of a F2P product's life.

We ran around for 2.5 hours

Found a couple of missions. One to defend Sunken Harbor... shot a few enemies

Found another mission

I feel like we MUST have missed something

1375797993.0,1jt7zb,Somewhere in the Melding... A Guide to Blackwater Anomaly (BWA),KinokoSama,30,7,11,"Hi there Firefall friends!

I had just commented on a recent thread that someone needs to write a comprehensive BWA guide. After a bit of searching on the sub to see if there already was one, but consider yourself warned anyway!

First, so I am no expert on the matter. I've done a little bit of research, but I will be very open to suggestions/edits. Tonight I may take a few screenshots to add some visual aid. This *will* be a long post, but it's a frickin' guide. Deal with it! 

Let's get started.
*****
###What is Blackwater Anomaly?

Blackwater Anomaly is the culmination of the Echoes from Sertao questline. After crafting your three Arcfold Modulators, if you are incredibly lucky), you'll be able to craft the final modulator - the Chosen Arcfold Modulator - and gain entry to the anomaly. BWA could be considered the ""furthest"" progression content in the game at this point, along with Baneclaw.

In my opinion

###How does one get in to Blackwater Anomaly?

Crafting your own Chosen Arcfold Modulator is not required to be able to enter the instance. As long as your squad leader has their modulator

If you are a keyholder, and on a platform inside is a device that will bring up an interface similar to the PvP queue that will let you start the instance. Hopefully we see more areas added to this queue soon!

###What will I find inside?

Chosen... Lots of Chosen. The gameplay inside is fairly straightforward, the map is very open and there are many ways to go. Confusion could be a factor for players new to the area (as it was for me, even following an experienced squad leader).

The instance has 6 total events to complete

Also, ammo, etc., as well as Rare supply crates containing bonus goodies. (link map w/ routes below)

###Stage 1 - The Repulsor:

When you first enter the area, and defend the area for three minutes. Chosen will funnel in from 3 directions, just kill them as they come, easy! After three minutes is up, the Melding will be pushed back, this signifies the transition into...

###Stage 2 - The Disturbances:

Once the Melding gives way

Remember, you dumbass!

Each one of these objectives handles like a single Warbringer during a Sunken Harbor invasion. Simply destroy the pillar in the middle of the large object, then get the hell outta there, 'cause it's about to blow! Be wary of Elite Dreadnaughts/Juggernauts, and those stinking bifold cannons!

Rinse and repeat two more times as you move across the map

###Stage 3 - Climby Climberton and the Mysterious Anomaly:

The Melding gets pushed back a final time, confused, etc. 

From the Eastern side of the map, and *many* more Chosen populate the final area itself. Simply kill everything you see; with fire, poison, electricity, or whatever you have at your disposal. Once the area is clear, interact with the 3 pillars, and then finally interact with the object that spawns in the center of the platform. This triggers the final event

###The Daring Escape!!!!!!!:

If you wait around for who-knows-how-long, jump on it, and glide allllllll the way back down to where the very first 3-minute event took place. Board the dropship once you get there, and that's it! Congratulations! You've completed Blackwater Anomaly! You've just netted yourself ~70k XP, ~3k (probably more) Crystite, ~4k (probably more) various resources, and possibly a few dropped items!

If your squad managed to do the whole thing in under 25 minutes without anyone Double-Dying (becoming incapacitated

Oh, you're gonna have to do that again 19 more times!

###Wait

Oh

[Here](http://imgur.com/yPvod5j) is a handy map I've found showing the crashed dropships which are possible SIN Imprint spawn locations! [Credit goes to Sh0ppingList of the Firefall forums] The dropship all the way to the West in the lower portion of the map may never spawn a SIN Imprint. Some on the forum have said they have seen one there

But [HERE](http://imgur.com/ct4CaVb) is a map with a ***TON*** of information on it.  [Credit for this one goes to DasBaum of the Firefall forums ([link to forum post](http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/blackwater-map-sin-imprints-rare-crates.1005341/))]:
  
* Follow the grey route to find ***everything*** - rare supply crates
* Follow the blue route for objectives and SIN Imprints only; 
* Follow the purple route for objectives only.

[Thanks to /u/asmodaeius for the clarification]

###What about speed runs?!

I'm glad you asked. You may have seen /u/MannerRev's [post](http://redd.it/1jt0j6) showing an elapsed time of 9 minutes and 48 seconds! Whoah! As for how this is accomplished

&gt;We do a 3-way split. After the repulsor, and one east. Two other people can just sit around and do nothing, since we really only need 3 people. They can also help out at other disturbances if someone's having trouble alone.

&gt;After the disturbances

On the reasoning behind speed runs:

&gt;I believe the break point is such that if your BWA runs are &gt;14 minutes

&gt;Under 14 minute runs and you're starting to break even, but that's not why I run it.

&gt;I really don't care for drops at all. Barely clear anything. Not sure why it says 226 enemies killed

*****
###And there you have it!

That's about all I can think to add at this point. I hope someone finds this useful, make it known in the comments. And again, screenshots may be added soon. Oh, and if anyone wants to run BWA with me - I'm Hyzenthlay on NA (usually on the US East-1 shard), and I'm currently working on maxing my Dragonfly. Also, I'm incredibly attractive.

had an absolute blast! We were instantly hopping in on some huge
Thumping parties
exploring. I thought I would share our feedback here.


**What we loved:**

- It's so easy to jump in with friends and just PLAY. The squad system
was a breeze and its nice and easy to find squadmates on the map.

- There is a great cooperative atmosphere about the game. I love how
easy it is to just jump into a fight with a stranger and everyone
benefits.
- Easily to most fun I've ever had collecting resources in a game.

- We love how fluid the gameplay is. You are just flowing from dynamic
quest

- The core gameplay mechanics were something all of us could grasp
instantly. Fly

- The crafting system seems to have a decent level of depth to it. I
already want to try rebuilding some items to see the different
results.

- Its incredibly stable. 4 different rigs
a single crash or complaint of lag.


**What we didn't:**

- Obviously the crafting system is a WIP. Right now its not a learning
curve
system out it doesn't seem like there is much more to add to it
besides quality and material type. I found myself using Eve Online
references to explain the system and that should raise a red flag.
There are a number of ""AH-HA"" moments before you figure how the whole
system links together.

- Being able to click on subcomponents and jumping right to their
crafting requirements would be great.

- With crafting being so important (and timers forcing you to leave
and come back) I wouldn't mind seeing molecular ""pickup"" stations so I
don't have to travel back to town to pick up that gun 13 minutes
later. Keep me in the loop of exploring

- Its tough to find a downed friendly in the chaos of a thumper drop.
A more more noticeable icon over them would be a huge asset.

- Dynamic quests could use more to make them less rinse and repeat. A
chance to spawn a mini-boss or a chance to spawn a dynamic arcing
quest that takes you further into the map and possibly into the
melding.

- Manufacturing tokens to get access to tier II battleframes seems
disjointed from the rest of the systems in the game. The process of
manufacturing tokens from medals from awards from points (etc) also
seems needlessly complex. Perhaps we're just not grasping the system
completely.

- Its not readily apparent what resource refining II-IV do. Perhaps
someone here can answer that.



Overall impressions were excellent. We were looking for a persistent
game that we could all play regardless of how many hours each person
puts into it and this might just be the one! Keep it up Red 5!",self,t5_2s629,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1d39wa/first_impressions_from_a_group_of_new_players/

 In alot of games people see xp increasing their level giving them access to a techtree of some sort or an ever increasing list of abilities.

In Firefall this does not happen. This game takes that xp and gives you the option of what to do with it.  You have choices and lots of research to do. 

Doing the research gives you access to make higher level items

Xp also can be used to increases your frames ability to use the more advanced items you make.

Basically

Lets say you start with the accord assault.  Great mobility makes the map a little more forgiving. Now

Now you think ""oh man I'm going to lose all that progression"".

THIS IS NOT TRUE.

What sets Firefall apart is that so much is shared across your account.  People seem to be stuck on looking at frames as character.  They are not!  Shared battle frame equipment (plating, resource refining research, thumper research, Secondary weapons, and even abilities from accord frames can be shared with their 'advanced' versions.

None of this was lost

You also did not lose your knowledge.  I am sure ARES missions are twice as easy because you now know what your doing. The gear is not what makes you better

Basically what I want people to understand is that this game is to be enjoyed.  The content is still being written and we have a chance to give feedback to make this game better. You cant beat the fact that your friends can download the game and play it with you right away.  They don't have to catch up or do endless quests

You don't NEED t4 gear

Hit those Sin towers so you can see the map and start you journey.  Save up for the arcport's  and find a frame that suits your style.  

Have fun

Increased the health of the MPU on the mission ""A River Runs Through It"".

Increased the health of the thumper by ~50%.

Blackwater Harvester will now start at 24 players instead of 30.

NPCs should no longer be afraid their souls will be removed when going through friendly forcefields.

Multiple navigation changes to NPCs to prevent some of the more egregious issues with wandering people.

Modifications to NPC creature behaviors to hopefully be a little more dynamic.

Aranha will now be less likely to stick inside their own homes.

Whiptail Threshers have had their hit points reduced slightly.

Another battle won by Red 5 in the never-ending war of frames per second.

Removed the steam particles shooting out of the smokestacks on Point A in Orbital Comm Tower as they were reducing framerate.

Reduced the overall size of the downloaded client by moving more textures into virtual textures that are streamed the first time you see them.

You can control your streaming texture settings in the Network options dialog.

Setting the network speed will only affect the prioritization of streaming textures.

The iron sights on the Assault Rifle no longer shimmer while looking at water.

Hacking the Orbital Comm Tower terminal should now be a bit more consistent.

Rocks and shrubbery have had their combat abilities reduced.




**UI Changes**




Changed the fonts used in multiple UI components to be more readable.

Multiple organizational changes to UI code and files (FYI to all you LUA hackers).

Unread notifications will now pulse on the UI to let you know you need to give them attention.

Changed keybind icons to use images instead of just a letter.

You can now tell if someone is mentally ignoring your whispers. We now notify you if the player is offline or AFK.


**Combat Changes**




Battleframe energy is now set to 0 when switching between frames. 

Recharge should begin immediately.

Slightly reduced unsquadded non-critical assist XP.

The Recon Sniper rifle now takes 500ms to reach perfect accuracy when changing between unscoped and scoped.

This is being done to prevent perfectly accurate quick-scoping shots.

The Recon Marksman rifle will lose accuracy the more rapidly you fire it while in unscoped mode.

The Marksman rifle is still perfectly accurate in scoped mode.

The Recon ability Cryo Shot will now remove double damage from an opponent on impact.

Engineer deployable Repair Station Tier II upgraded to tech II and III now properly give nearby allies ammunition.

Abilities with knockback again actually knock back instead of up.




**Crafting and Item Changes**




All refining research has a new prerequisite of the previous refining process.

The original refining process will be returned after researching the new process.

Changed crit chance of gear nanoprints to 15% for uncommon

Reduced Rare Refining (Brimstone) times by ~30%.

Adjusted costs on most nanoprints

Refined resources are required in lower level gear.

Generally gear items cost fewer resources

Module items cost a bit more resources.

Decreased coralite received from static deposits by ~50%.

It was more efficient to use sonic detonators than a thumper.

Increased overall drop rates by 100%.

Level 9

New rare Level 15 decrypted nanoprints have been added to vendors for players who are willing to pay more to know the type of item they are getting.

Uncommon encrypted nanoprints have been added to the encrypted nanoprint vendors. They cost a fraction of the crystite compared to Rare prints.




**Bug Fixes**




Fixed issues with the TAB screen remaining after leaving a PvP match.

Fixed a bug where squads would get split onto opposite teams in PvP.

Fixed the NavWheel Invite Squad option so that it properly fills the chat box with the command needed.

Fixed issues with the wrong resolutions being used when selecting resolutions in the Video Options.

Fixed loot info cards getting stuck on the screen.

Fixed the scoreboard breaking if you used reloadui during the middle of a match.

Fixed an issue with match countdown not matching up with the actual match start.

Fixed issues with the reticle sometimes disappearing.

Fix for video settings getting reset after logging out.

Fix for UI clumping text at the tops &amp; bottoms of text widgets when scrolling quickly.

Around 8PM EST, raring to go! Without much fuss, we pushed back the melding and started the event. We failed the first try as we were a bit disorganized, but after that one we managed to complete the event maybe 5 times in a row.... with no one getting anything. :( 

We eventually failed another try for some unknown reason. (I honestly think the game glitched out a bit, the next shot went off without a hitch once again, and when it was over, Zone chat was filled with resounding cries of exultation. We had gotten our pieces, Aero and Oilspill told us we should now head to Thump Dump or Sunken Harbor to continue. Huzzah!

Some random notes and things I learned:

* Bastions can actually heal the shield generators with their Tesla rifle alt-fire. It is slow as all hell
* We had four people total on the top ledge(s), and then we had a Firecat ""floating"" between the two spots, helping to clean up. Everyone else was on the ground.
* Elite Juggernauts are scary
* You can feed the Repulsor more Melded Crystite to extend the time.

Questions:

1. Some in the group were saying that Diamondhead's event is the ""most annoying"" in that you can do it upwards of 20 times without seeing a key fragment. Is this true? Do the other areas have higher drop rates?
2. I'm almost certain that I had read on more than one website/blog that it's possible to solo these events...... WHAT? HOW?! Seriously? We had, but I can't see being able to complete the event with less than 5 people...
3. Are the events in the other areas essentially the same? Defend a location for ~5 minutes? Are they harder? Easier?
4. How hard is BWA itself?

Steps:

* press alt-f1 to open console
* type in replay_record_begin (starts replay)
* can close console by pressing alt-f1 again or leave open
* type in replay_record_end (finishes replay)

You can view the replay in two ways:

* (opens up a new game client dedicated to replay). Accessing the replay file and running it. its usually located in users/videos/firefall directory and you double click on the .nsr file
* (uses current game client). Accessing the console again and typing replay_playback_begin and selecting the replay file from the list shown in the console


Some simple options:

* use wasd to navigate on the 2d plane
* use jump (space) to go up and crouch (ctrl) to go down.
* Use the playback menu
* Use Q and E to jump to different players and F to return to the last selected player (assuming you navigate somewhere else).

Naturally I started looking at starter packs and Red Beans to see if there was a way around it by paying.  There doesn't appear to be.  I also didn't like what I found there.  I know they are supposed to keep adding frames so I'll either need to grind or pay in the future to have many frames available for PVP (my main interest in Firefall).  The problem is the only pricing that makes a lot of sense is going in for $100 starter pack and then buying $100 of Red Beans for future frame purchases.  That's very steep considering what Firefall is thus far.  I love Jetball but the rest of PVP doesn't do anything for me and while PVE is fun it gets repetitive.  I feel like I can't grind out frames reasonably (way worse than Tribes Ascend or MWO) and I can't buy them at a decent price either.  I did unlock 20 Pilot Tokens easily enough but after that it gets a lot harder and slower.

I wasn't understanding why this game seemed unpopular despite being fun but once I hit this wall so to speak I see why.  The grind is ridiculous and the prices are too.  It's a shame.  I was extremely interested in Firefall (even trying to form a Jetball team) but now I've lost a lot of interest and not sure if I'll continue playing.",self,t5_2s629,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1iw9kj/grind_too_extreme_prices_too_high/

They were just events that had no bearing from one to the other. An obvious example of this is the current scene with SC2. MLG has no effect on IPL

A long term formatted league.

Currently, and LimeLight getting involved in the tournament scene and because the scene is so young, rankings from one game to there other may or may not have bearing on how teams are matched up. I would like to propose an actual long term league where teams compete twice, maybe 3 times a week. Teams would face one opponent each day and the win/loss would be reported as well as the other stats K/D/A that can be used in a database of stats. This would benefit the community as a whole because that ranking can be used to assign seeds during tournaments. Also, the consistent play on the team base will give R5 plenty of information about balancing PvP on a team basis, as opposed to Pubs.

I'm bringing this up to the general public because I can't do it alone. I'm going to need the help of current teams (no matter the vet status) to build it up properly and get rules established. I need help from current tournament organizers so we can get it all organized and we are all on board for this type of system. I also need help from the community: artists for streams, caster fatigue is killer) for recording and streaming.

I joined beta about a month after Open World Beta was first released. Seen, mostly played PvE and been an active part of the community as a user and then mod of /r/firefall on Reddit. I was there for the reveal of the Firefall Bus at Anime Expo. I have posted, commented and helped all I can to help improve the game and it's users. Paid my support with a Commander Pack and organized army events. But in all of this, was it worth the time, effort and costs and will I continue? That is the question.

From the moment I stepped into the game I was drawn in by the beautiful world and the mobility of jetpack and glider to explore it. The enemies felt they fit into that alien world that was still our 'home' and it really put me in that futuristic world. From then, jetpacked or otherwise gotten myself up any mountain. There is little left to explore in this world.

At first there were a few minor quests just to wet the tong. A few more were added later but it has always been a sore lacking feature of the world. That wasn't all what the game was aimed toward though so it was a forgivable downside. Who follows the main storyline of an Elder Scrolls game anyway when there is a world to explore?

At first the game held amazing potential and I stayed through bugs and patches to keep testing out the system. The willingness to scrap what was made to find a better approach was unique in a developing game (or at least a public one like this). This has been both a blessing and a curse as improvements was not new content. Small things were added over time

Extra Credits did a video recently (http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/the-jc-pennys-effect) that really went over this 'issue'. The system isn't made like a normal Shooter or RPG that rewards you with unlocks or gear. Instead you collect resources with the goal to build an item or unlock a constraint. The big issue arises then just what do those do for you? Let you kill/thump all the better to collect more resources to get more items to thump better and well you get the point. The game has no big goal

In a years time

These last two months I have only found pleasure in organizing larger events like Heavy Squad Meld Thumping but now that was taken from me with the latest resource changes. Constraints are as unrewarding an unlock as it can get and the T2 weapons require so many varied resources it would take months of thumping to get the right ones at a rare value. No trading has also hampered this effort even further. I am left with just more and more frustrations that I can go on for paragraphs about them.

So there was a discussion on Saturday's F:COM (FFANZ meeting) regarding what kinds of walls are slowing players progress down for Battleframe progression.  What we have been seeing is that players with a few frames going into T8+ unlocks have quickly run out of Accord Merrit Points.  Crystite and XP are easy enough to get but that AMP Wall seems to be the long standing block.

I am not saying there shouldn't be a wall

Also

AMP Wall
- Advantage - Leaves room for loose XP
- Disadvantage - Forces players to farm ARES missions and similar events.
- Numbers: 1350 AMPs are needed for 1 full frame unlock.  At even 2 AMPs per mission (not always true)
- Suggestion 1: Add AMPs to 100% full (Squad???) thumper rewards (at 6 min per thumper that's 10 AMPs per hour).  Rewards players who drop thumpers.
- Suggestion 2: Reduce costs of AMP items by about 1/5th (make the 45 costing item go down to 30 or 35?)

XP Wall 
- Advantage - Leaves room for loose Crystite and Resources
- Disadvantage - Leaves spare AMPs that currently is only good for Resonators (Benefit: Resonators give XP so...)

Crystite Wall
- Disadvantage - Too many

Resources Wall
- Advantage - Leaves room for loose XP
- Disadvantage - Grinding out resources generally is boring

Final Thoughts:
AMP wall or XP wall seem the best course for the game.  Both have their uses but currently AMPs are just a pain to farm/grind while XP is easier to acquire in all aspects of the game (including PvP).",self,t5_2s629,False,,FFM,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1jemdc/discussion_what_is_your_progression_wall/

I struggle with this feature, many years, permanent item loss is something that I'm *very* familiar with.  That being said, I feel like the ""blow"" of losing an item permanently could be significantly softened by the following 3 things:

**Display the total repair pool

* Maybe it is there
* Knowing how many more times I can repair a module will allow me to plan in advance for the necessary resources (or seek out higher quality ones)
* Brings the item decay system to the forefront of the core gameplay loop

**Make crafting a new item *not* involve digging to the bottom of a collapsing drop down menu.**

* The current crafting menu, to craft a new item, I must first find the item in the list so that I can then discover the components it requires. Then, I must either visually scan (or use the search bar) to find the specific item. After setting the item up with resources to craft it, I must repeat that whole process for the **next** component.
* Instead, via interacting with the component listed in the module manufacturing screen. For example, in order to craft an ""Explosive Payload"" that I need for a Recon Decoy, I should just be able to click the Explosive Payload component to bring up the resource selection window, then click a button that takes me to that component's manufacturing menu. Once that is set up, I should be able to return to the main module via a back button of some sort (like a web browser).
* Automate the crafting process. Once an item has been crafted once, the tradeoff for this could be increased manufacturing time (but components only take like 5s to put together anyway).

**Categorize our equipment and modules in our inventory the same way that resources are categorized.**

* Pretty straightforward. Basically line them out under Assault/Recon/Dreadnaught/Engineer/Biotech. This will make it easier to take stock of any extra modules I may have in my back pocket because I forgot I built them (which happens! it's not just me
* This will also more easily show me what quality levels of modules I have available to me should I need an emergency fallback item while I wait for a new/better version to complete manufacturing.

**TL;DR:** This is a list of ideas on how to improve the game in ways that will improve UX with permanent item loss.",self,t5_2s629,1372273353.0,,Medic,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1h4jui/assuming_permanent_item_loss_is_here_to_stay_what/

*I'll admit, I was hurt, wounded even, that all of my time &amp; experience and pre .6 minerals were nigh useless...  I couldn't progress past the white blocks despite my wild desire to immediately unlock the frame as fully as possible.  *I too felt perhaps we had been n00b-tubed...*  **But then, I came to realize that as always with the process of creation, I wasn't stunted at all, in fact I had just as much power as before, was the new creation of new systems that were so vast and overwhelming,  I thought I may never know the answer to this endless mystery...*

**Then I put on my robe &amp; wizard hat, fired up my battleframe cocked, locked &amp; ready to rock &amp; set out to blaze a new trail through the newly created system...**

**Damn am I glad that I did!**

Just like SWG (which I absolutely loved) the crafting system may be a bit too daunting or creative with nigh-endless proliferation of options for certain players of certain mindsets. **And that's OK**, similar to the survey I recieved, i think that's a smart idea.   I also think we need more time to spend on crafting for additional feedback, but there are definently some areas that need to be addressed ASAP.

*Again,* **but as always with new creation, comes a host of new issues...**

The thread comments will be open to the crafting system &amp; feedback, &amp;/or any crafting experience you have in other games (especially SWG)

The suggestion for crafting improvements I have are as follows (and i think some of them are already being worked on) :

* **1) Mobile Printing!**  In the age of the S.I.N., especially with the increased amount of printing time now required.  It seems to make more sense with the continuity of the game anways, to me your inventory is just a representation of your warehouse where all those thousands of minerals and DNA/technology and calldowns/consumeables are stored... Your not really running around with all that stuff, thats why it's all call downs, and gets arcfolded right to you or dropped like a thumper...  *MOBILE PRINTING SUGGESTION BROUGHT TO YOU BY TREEZAT &amp; DHAC, APPROVED BY SKARTH &amp; YOUNGBLOOD &amp; THE BB COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF MOJO WHO WILL REMAIN ANONYMOUS BUT KNOW WHO THEY ARE*

* **2)** *speaking of saving time while printing:* **Multiple print queuing!**  let us make x amount of components &amp;/or subcomponents in order as long as we have the resources, real adventurers don't need sleep)

**EDIT: UPDATE - patch 0.6.1597 released yesterday 4/4/13 appears to have introduced multiple resource refining for raw resources

* **3)** *speaking more of printing on the go:* what about a remote access to the backend printer web interface via website &amp;/or mobile app?  This way you can print anytime from any device... This may be an excellent opportunity for a subscription service &amp;/or additional micro-transactions so the developers can afford to feed their families...

I think these are some pretty viable solutions for some of the major concerns regarding the new extensive amounts of print time taking away from the experience of adventure &amp; exploration in the game.  With trading introduced, players who prefer to adventure can still keep their footing with the print-nerds like me...

**I'm also looking forward to the later stages of crafting, etc.  experimentation was one of my favorite parts of SWG crafting...**

*Finally the rate at which resources of all types are obtained is obviously relavent to this thread

**Hope to hear from some brother crafters &amp; fellow firefall community supporters!**

1. What *planned* feature/change/update would you like to see in the next content patch if the development time for it was not an issue?

2. What *unplanned/unannounced* feature/change/update would you want to be implemented into Firefall in general?

For me:

**1.** A solid tutorial quest line. The one currently implemented is nearly impossible to get through without experiencing one of the missions in the tutorial bugging out


**2.** More variety in gameplay. As of right now, Dynamic Events, Chosen, and Baneclaw. Though most of these missions have the same formula with a small mix thrown in; protect x until y happens. Thumpers, Watchtowers, LGV data recovery, and Downed Thumpers all require you to protect something until something is completed (usually time). The only exceptions to these are Melding Tornadoes, LGV Race, but I just can't help feeling like I'm just doing the same thing over and over with a different name. It would be refreshing to see some more variety added to the game.

 Bug Fixes

        Fixed more issues of reticles disappearing.
        Aranha nests and Coralite nodes should no longer appear in the tunnel between Trans Hub and Copacabana.
        Thumpers have had their phase-shifting abilities nerfed and are no longer able to hide inside certain rocks.
        Fixed issues with the client minimizing after changing video resolutions.
        Fixed various floating rocks and vines throughout the world.
        Modified NPC pathing to prevent issues of the NPCs getting stuck in locations.
        Closed more holes that allowed you inside the Trans Hub hangar.
        Fixed an issue where the hacking team would receive XP rewards for the counter hack.
        Fixed ways that players were able to get more manufacturing slots than they were supposed to have.
        Fixed inventory freezes when removing gear.
        Fixed issues with the Engineer wrench count not updating on the UI.
        Fix for that weird black rectangle that always appears over the Accord splash screen at login that nobody talks about but everyone sees.
        Fixes for respawning with weird ammo counts.
        Fixed multiple client crash issues.
        Fixed particle lights not being cleaned up at low lighting quality settings which caused performance degradation over time.


    Game Changes

        PvP matches will now reward loot that matches the level of the battleframe that you're wearing when the match ends.
            Only winning teams receive loot.
        Players must do at least 20% of the damage on a target in order to receive an assist XP reward.
        Accuracy, and Crit modules have all had their bonuses halved across the quality levels.
        Medic's Heal Grenade alt-fire will now only heal the medic if a friendly is within the splash radius.
        Medic's Heal Gun will now use the Medic's Rate of Fire instead of the target's Rate of Fire (thanks tdopz).
        Recon's Sniper Rifle will now do 400 default damage on body shot. Head shot crit modifier was increased to compensate.
        The Assault Rifle and Suppressor Rifle bullet speed has been increased by 66%.
        Reduced the camera shake associated with being hit by the Assault plasma cannon. Also decreased the radius of when camera shake would be applied.
        Changed the Carbonite Casing costs of modules.
            This was patched live last week.
        Geology scans will now appear on the world map for your entire squad.
        Sped up inventory updates so that you don't load the entire inventory every time you pick up an item.


    UI Changes

        Chat now has global key bindings for chat scrolling that are in the keybindings
            pgup - scroll up 3 lines
            pgdown - scroll down 3 lines
            alt+pgup - scroll to top
            alt+pgdown - scroll to bottom
            Rebinding these keys to normal letter keys will prevent them from working in chat input mode.
            If a new message comes in and you not in chat input mode
        Added an interface option for changing the font type between an handful of our font types
        Increased font size from point 9 to point 10
        Relabeled option 'Background Transparency' to 'Background Opacity' as it better describes its functional orientation. Ie100% is fully Opaque
        Reversed the gradient on the hold-to-interact UI: increases the contrast of the bar's depletion.

It comes in the form of huge hitches that usually happen after I jump off of something high. This renders me incapable of softening my landing, taken over Trans-Hub. When I come back from the hitch, I'm ash because 30 of them shot me with a plasma cannon simultaneously. Plasma that I could have avoided had the lag spike not occurred.

This is the only game I have played where this has occurred for me. This is also a relatively recent issue. I've been in the beta for many months at this point. I know it's ""in beta."" In less than a month

I worry about the overall reception of the game once it's freely accessible. I worry about the network performance of the game once anyone can play (assuming they even **can

1375976478.0,1jylwm,[feedback] My first week in Firefall,alexformosoc,16,4,20,"Hello! I just completed my first week playing

First, really good map design with bugs here and there where a player could get stuck and the only way to unstuck is to relog and lost all you were doing. Fortunately this bugs just happened to me twice in a one week period witch I find really good imho, also I was exploring and jumping everywhere and whatnot. 
Not im going to talk about specific points of the game:

1) About the crafting: I really love this system. Its easy to learn but hard to master. I think it needs to emphasize more on what is a mineral and what is gas etc, thankfully the people in the chat is almost always willing to teach. 

2) About the Battleframes: Really good system, specially in PvP. Loved the horizontal progression and the unlocks. But I still think the game needs to give more feedback to the player about the diference of ""Assault Rifle"" and ""Assault Rifle I""...

3) About the ARES missions:  I liked them but got bored of them soon, something almost impossible for a human player unless you have less than 80 ping. 

4) About the Events, but I think the smaller events, like Tornados and Warbringers alone, need more rewards (See next topic)

5) Thumping: The good stuff, at least in my week playing, people don't give a damn about a captured watchtower or city, because ""Thumping for rare resources is more important"", textual from the zone chat, and I got that answer 7 times. This is an attitude found specially more on high-level advanced players. They don't care about a watchtower, the only they care for are invasions because it gives a hefty amount of exp, we who like to be defending cities and watchtowers and the ones that like to thump nonstop

6) About the general exploration: Its really good to just, I haven't found anything else. This game needs more exploration events, like challenges that involve escalating mountains, crossing lakes, or even a huge boss. Like the ones that appear at the end of the big thumpers, but just standing there, chilling, its the mission to kill the White Wolf (or something)

7) About the tutorial: Its divided by 2 segments, really good, except for the non-funny robot which I was expecting to be funny for the ""he has a straaaannngeeee AI"" part. When you leave the Lab, and get introduced to crafting, battleframe upgrading etc, that part is simply awful, I was getting lost and asking in the zone chat instead of doing the tutorial because it was 0 interesting. Also

8) General: I don't think I can write anything else, menus are ok, not awesome, but ok. I think its a really good job the fact that you accept ui-mods even in this early stages of the Open Beta. The night-day cycle has the strange feeling that the nights are actually longer than days, and they are stupidly dark, to the point where gameplay becomes damaged by the fact that you cant see ANYTHING unless you buy flares because the flashlight sucks. 

I really hope this feedback is good for something

Thanks

1364432880.0,1b5d0n,Making Thumping More Interesting: Suggestion,TimmyToldYou,15,2,16,"Right now thumping is sort of boring. It's stressful, I know how I'm going to deal with it, are fun

Make wave ""types.""

Since I know (from earlier discussions of how thump spawns work) that each monster is assigned,"" that is put into an equation to figure out what spawns for a thumper, the waves should be able to be kept balanced while still being interesting.

Examples: 

Big Baddie Wave, i.e Megali or Terrorclaws. Possibly they have support sometimes, like a swarm of aranha or argonauts, but the main focus is on the big bad guy(s).

Flying Swarm: As the name implies

Artillery Support: Area appropriate long range tanky enemies (siegers

OH NOES: Explosive Aranha supported by tanky-melee enemies

etc


The point being that any one wave could spawn at any time

You could even mix the waves to keep it interesting, again, into a semi-random swarm fest.

I think a system like this would make thumping a constantly fun

TL;DR
Add a wave ""type"" or ""theme"" system to thumping that makes certain random waves spawn certain things, and is therefore repetitive and boring.

Thoughts?

This was something brought up at [F:COM (FFANZ Meeting)](http://ffanz.com/threads/ffanz-player-meeting.302/) last saturday and I didn't have time to write it up till now. The general problem at the moment with Chosen Invasions is general Latency and Difficulty of the event. In it's current status

First: Change the enemy drop table of the Warbringers (aka better mobs not more mobs). Change the spawn table to include Siegbreakers or even Juggernaut Elites. These bring the quality of enemies up and you can reduce the amount that spawn. At the same time

Second: Currently (besides the 2 minute ship spawner) enemies spawn at a rate of once a minute. This is a perfect opportunity to include a Population Check within the Event. Run a check for how many players are in the area for the next spawn cycle. Depending on the number of players

TL : DR - Spawn Better and Less Mobs + Change color difficulty based on number of players. ",self,t5_2s629,False,,FFM,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1jc0wa/scalability_and_performance_improvements_on/

Those being said:

1)  How viable is it to play multiple styles with multiple frames?  

2)  I know it is *possible* to kit out multiple frames

3) Are those that pick a frame and keep to it at a huge advantage over those that choose to diversify?  

4) What are the advantages (if any) to diversification?  

5) Is it viable to swap frames as needed for tactical reasons, it would effectively preclude quick swapping for tactical gain)

6) Are the different frames SO different in playstyle that swapping might lower your effective skill level with each frame that it becomes an inherent advantage to practice only one playstyle?

7) Are the frames similar enough in playstyle that there is effectively little reward to choosing to specialize?  (opposite of question 6 -- this is a balance that might be hard to get right!)

8) How difficult is it to level multiple frames to a satisfactory standard?  For me at least

IMO, presentation, or both. While I understand that this is about as ""true"" of a game beta as you can get these days, it doesn't change the fact that I want to have a good time while I'm playing the not-done version of FireFall. In light of this, I have optimized my Firecat to suit my dive-bombing, burninating, up-close-and-personal playstyle. Even if you have crummy minerals

**Plating:** Accord I (high end crafted versions give great regen)

**Passive:** Incinerator

**Ability 1**: Crater

**Ability 2**: Overcharge

**Ability 3**: Immolate

**HKM**: Shockwave

**Primary:** Thermal Cannon

**Secondary:** Shotgun

**TIPS**

* Incinerator affects all frame abilities as well as the Thermal Cannon's alt fire. This means that your Crater and HKM Shockwave will ignite enemies.

* For some reason (**DEFINITELY** a bug), as I just created two wildly different quality versions of Overcharge I, and they have exactly the same stats as one another, while they are 1% different in power from the Stock variant, with roughly a 25% higher cooldown. Stick with Stock Overcharge for now.*

* With a short-cooldown Overcharge

* Use the Thermal Cannon on your way into a fight (from the air), swap to your shotgun, hit immolate, then go to work. When Immolate is out, take off and begin bombardment with the Thermal Cannon again.

It's pretty straightforward, though!",,False,self,t5_2s629,1365693225.0,Medic,

Overall


But I thought I'd write up my first impressions, after all!  And I'll also try to describe the things I like a lot too.


**Game Introduction**


After logging in (and accidentally skipping the Introduction Tab), BattleFrame information is very hard to come by in this game.  Though, in some ways it doesn't matter
(new tier 1 BattleFrames are cheap)
enough information about each type of frame to make an informed
decision to start with
with...


I think the game would benefit greatly from a introductory
training/battleframe-testing area/room.  Because
blindly) choosing an initial frame
learning the game's interface:  how to move and shoot
And while the introduction does sort of cover this
busy.... 


I liked the dropship introduction to the open world.  However
landing, too fast.
Aero and Oilspill are yammering at you
popping up.  Tutorial pop-ups are popping
basic idea of how to move and shoot.  (And even that is heavily supplemented by
experience with other games I've played in the past.)  Meanwhile
players are chatting away in a chat interface I haven't learned yet.
(Although
other games.)  All in all
newbie attention at once. 


So


**Quest System**


I get the feeling that (World Notifications
the quest system is mostly just for introductory/tutorial purposes.
Which is just fine by me.  I'm far more interested in open-world PvE
with dynamic events
some issues there.  The most annoying of which was the locations being
bugged.  ""Finding Tiki"" was particularly problemetic
objectives (one line item
markers
indicator is on a dropship
meters from the indicator (I finally found this on my 4th
attempt...after giving up and doing side-quests/exploration
my previous 3 attempts.)  This was highly annoying.


More generally
are sometimes hard to locate
close enough to them for them to be displayed on your mini-map
be hard to determine which direction to move in.  They really should
be more
are close


Also


However
beta ends.


**Other questing gripes**


I tried and failed to do racing quests
which in hindsight, I hadn't talked to Terromoto, and so didn't even have an LGV in my inventory.  My second attempt, I talked to him, and he
supplied an LGV
where the race started.  I then went to a race terminal, and thought race 2
(like my first attempt) was a foot/jump-pack race
different
hindsight
terminals to start a race. However
either missed it
(though few idiots do)
better communicated to players.


I didn't understand the antenna side-quest at all.  And still don't.
Much


Same goes for the Holmer Security side-quest.  No idea of where to go
or what to do.


I had no issues with the Crashed LGV or Crashed Thumper
side-quests. (Well
terrain


**PvE Combat**


This was great!  Controls are intuitive
challenging.  Finding an appropriate level of challenge is as simple
as finding the appropriate enemies to engage (or run away from).  I
enjoyed the open-world PvE so much
majority of my time.


But that's all I'm going to say here
deals with the open world.   Except for...


**PvP Combat**

I only did 5 matches
and seemed balanced.  I was a little disappointed at map size; the PvP
playing field does feel like a slightly too-small sandbox.  But for
5v5
otherwise provided everything I'd expect from a good PvP match.


I am a little put off by the Execute mechanic.  Both viscerally (I
guess I'm a bit of a prude
tactically (when do I execute


It would seem (and please be forgiving to my complete newbie analysis
here)
only are you creating a revival ambush honeypot
opponent downed
re-spawn time.  That is
advantage in every respect
your team.


It's an interesting mechanic.  So interesting that I'm not
exactly sure how I feel about it


Anyway

**Gliding**


This was hard to figure out at first.  And I still don't know how to
spot
night
wish I had the ability to reset
out holding the spacebar
Though
while gliding.

But gliding is what really sold the Founder's Pack for me.  Being able
to gracefully sail over this beautiful open world is a new and highly
desirable experience.  Other than the previously mentioned difficulty
in identifying updraft locations
requirement of a glide-pad to trigger it.


I look forward to my many glide jumps to come!


**BattleFrame Progression**

This is the part of the game that needs the most work.  And it's
mostly UI work!  The basic concepts are good
messaging them to the player is atrocious.


Why
selection station?  I'll agree (strongly) that the Garage is already a
cluttered mess
frame"" function just seems dumb.   There are (at least) 4 discrete
battleframe tasks players engage in:  Frame Selection
License Unlocks
least complicated of these in a separate station makes little sense.
They either should all be combined into one station
into individual stations.  Though possibly Licensing and Loadout
should be combined because of their closer relationship
are really quite separate tasks.

I imagine the frame-selection separation is done for end-game player
benefit
and warpaint
use

It doesn't help that I didn't much care for any of the garage UIs.
They were all usable
understanding was achieved
navigate around in.  I'm hopeful that this is just beta vetting (the
simplest thing that works)
before the initial public release.

And the only part of this game I hated was the tech tree.  And please
note that I'm only describing my experience in tier 1...I still have
all sorts of fear

There didn't seem to be any rhyme
paths through the tech tree.  While
were available more to the right hand side
any other organization at play.  Additional weapons
components
throughout the tree. 

And it gets worse!  You can't compare upgrades
already have equipped. (Which for a new player
For example
there's no way to compare the 2 (or 3?) shotguns in the tech tree to
each other
pretty inconvenient...especially since there *is* support for 2 item
comparisons built into the game!)  So
your path based on which upgrades you (think you might) want.  (In the
example provided

And it gets worse from there.  I still know absolutely nothing about
tier 2
determine which which tier 2 track I'm on.  I'm not just
choosing my next minor upgrade
probably take another 5-10 hours of play to reverse.  

(I do get that
eventually
frames I prefer...but I'm focusing on a new player's experience here.)


This is especially cruel to a newbie.  The paths through the tree seem
utterly meaningless
while studying the path you are currently on.  So
position of confused ignorance
designed to keep you there.  There were definitely components in the
tree I worked toward
the path I am taking was perhaps leading me away from where I wanted to be going in the long(er) term. 

Anyway
experienced based progression.  But the form and organization of the
tech tree was easily the most disappointing aspect of my weekend play
experience.  Which was
positive.

**I like it!**

PvP was (map size aside) everything I hoped it would be


The open-world PvE dynamic events kept me busy

See you in-game!

Stage 1:  Just the basic Tree's for the classes with current descriptions of all the abilities. Try and use the same GUI system as in-game to make it easy to navigate (or at least a similar layout).

Stage 2: Add video's tied to each Base ability

Stage 3: Add in a Battleframe Loadout.  For T2 crafted items

Stage 4: Add in a custom module loadout that either pulls actual items stats of items your character owns or allows users to 'make' the module (manually setting the material/rarity?).

I know I am probably getting ahead of myself as Dev people are concentrated on improving/expanding the game.  But I think this would help out enormously to the game's attraction for both prospective

**Crystite

Currently, but instead that group thumping be encouraged. This could be accomplished in a few different ways, one being a 'buff' or 'bonus' to minerals gained while in a group. To keep it balanced, this bonus should not be above the amount a solo person could farm from a node. Rewarding those who adventure out alone or in smaller groups while still giving incentive for grouping with others.

**Thumping Events/Geography:**

I think one of the wonderful things about firefall is the world around us. At the moment, but I believe a 'high location' should just have a separate thumper event cycle than ones on the low ground. The event would include more flying enemies, jumping and tunneling enemies (detailed below) that would make it a challenge to thump there. Possibly you need to use a different kind of thumper for these?

**Possible Enemies for High elevation thump:**

Small Mosquito: Take the fire rate down a bit on these guys (so they arn't machine guns like the normal sized ones) and these would make it great as a 'swarm' mob mechanic.

Explosive Mosquito: These mobs have sucked the power from an Explosive Aranha. It has slowed them down but they are still deadly if not stopped.

Normal Mosquito: Same

Giant Mosquito (I forget the real name): Those big ones that pop out from the pools on one of the quests.

Terror Mosquito?: Some challenging flying enemy that has multiple abilities like the terror claws

Small and Normal Threshers: They dig so they can still get to the high ground. Make people look at their feet and not just the air.

Scanhammer no longer replenishes ammo.

Baptism will no longer make you immune from the dangers of water.

Dying and then being revived while under water will no longer make you immune to water damage.

Quartzite refining processes 1C through 1E are no longer giving out coralite.

Decreased the refining time of Thumper Sifted Earth to 1/10th of previous time. Decreased resource output of same processes by 1/3rd.

Decreased the Medic's Vamp Beam alt-fire to self-heal at the same rate as the Overheal alt-fire.

Increased the healing rate on the Engineer deployable Repair Station II. Removed the energy restoration.

Supercharge will no longer make super men out of players. Your energy will now deplete after supercharge wears off.

Changed the ""Resources Must Flow"" mission to only require 400 coralite.

Players in a downed state now have less hitpoints and are more easily killed by gun fire and abilities.
More graphical performance improvements.

You can now unqueue from PvP by hitting the L key by default.

Added a hotkey to the PvP queue window. You can use K to open the queue window.

You can now open the player screen (default P key) when in a downed state.

Added UI Feedback for invalid scan hammer results: Thumping prohibited, and No Significant Resources.

Squadmate resource scan reports look different from your own when appearing on the HUD.

Chat is now disabled while flying in on the dropship during the opening sequence.




**Bug Fixes**

Fixed uncommon weapon energy modules to actually give 15% weapon energy. Previously they were giving only 5%.

Fixed an issue where silicate deposits would sometimes not return any resources on the ""Tough Nut to Crack"" mission.

Fixed multiple instances of props not having collision around Trans Hub.

Fixed a few holes allowing you to get inside the Trans Hub hangar bay.

Fixed issues where you would not see the proper online state of people on your friends list.

Fixed a bug where squad cancellation did not work properly with random queuing.

Fix for randomly appearing/disappearing UI.

Fixed multiple issues where the ammo count on the gun would not match the ammo count on the UI.

Fix for entering AA turrets and reload prompt remaining displayed.

Fixed an issue where players would not always appear in SIN.

Really fixed the ability to stack healback and splash modules.

Fixed issues with hissers unburrowing in mid-air.

Even more fixes to the AI servers to prevent degredation over time.

Players may receive a notification panel after an OCT match. Nothing to worry about

I didnt get far in to the crafting and battleframes but I think that I have a general idea about how it all works but I have a few questions.
Since crafting is the only way of getting gear I realy wonder why they made it so complicated. I went through the ingame tutorial and I crafted a few stuff on my own but I still dont understand what I'm suposed to do with the minerals and metal I get from ""thumping""
But again I'm maybe just stupid for that stuff and other people dont have any problems with crafting.

Second question/observation is that these so called ""Chosen Ones"" are not properly explained but I dont have any problems with that.
They are the bad guys
If I undrrstood corectly they show up at random outposts and attack in waves that get bigger and stronger every time.
What I dont understand is will they atack every outpost no matter how small it is

I thought the amount of choice was nice

I decided to go Engineer because I love turrets and generally play very supportish, dear god). Was slightly annoyed that the Juggernauts attack can one shot my turrets, making it nigh useless to repair them.

Choice of abilities was alright, etc.) kinda bland and uninformative, and it only got worse when I hit T2 and it was unclear what difference there was between Omnidyne Servos and Kitsuon Servos when I'm crafting them with materials.

I know this has been touched upon before

**TL;DR** Choice of classes and customization ability wise is good
 
 
 
**PvE** 
 
I was slightly worried when I saw that the timeline for the game said that full PvE wasn't in yet

There are, I certainly found as a Engineer that I had no issue defending it and keeping my thumper above 90% integrity. The Advanced Thumpers were much harder (and to be fair, they do state that its meant to be 2-4 characters) My only complaint would be that the exploding aranhas feel far too common towards the later parts of the thumping, I've literally watched thumpers go from 50% to 15% from one bad exploding aranha chain. Even with a full group of 5 people with fairly good party diversity (1 T2 Assault, 1 T2 Engineer, 1 T1 Juggernaut, 1 T1 Bioengineer, as the smoke trail is basically invisible at night

Chosen Droppods and Incursions are fairly good XP and fun to play, although it seems as though its much easier to go around the chosen and ""backdoor"" their pod, then mop up after that, not sure what you can really do to help that other then put more chosen on drop pod guard.

Watchtower Defense/Reclaiming, as its night impossible to dodge their shots at close quarters, and I've honestly seen 5 or 4 walk through the door at once. Not fun.

LGVs/Crashed Thumpers I didn't interact with much. It SEEMS to me that doing LGVs is giving me pieces to eventually make my own

Crashed Thumpers I barely touched, but thats just a suggestion.
 
 
 
**TL;DR** Good variety of things to do, LGVs/Crashed Thumpers don't feel worth doing as their reward is not well explained.

**[NerdGasm Warning, and audio come together so well its exactly what I would want to compliment the primary-fire of the gun. Making a charged shot that has increased damage, and more importantly incredible area of effect with knock-back, but is so brilliantly balanced by not only its slow moving velocity and the amount of time it takes to charge, but also the visual and audible daunting...ness of the slow-moving death ball is pure warning enough to get out of its way. And wow does the nova cannon look cool as the light reflects of rich geometry during nighttime.

----

**[Suggestion]** The only problem I have with the Nova cannon (other than the current bugs) is that while charging it does not properly visually or audibly represent the amount of shots put into the Nova Ball, and then when you launch it, it's instantly massive.

As a fix I propose:

1. Visually keep the nova ball growing until it is shot allowing it to link up with the projectile size
2. Also maybe progressively adding visual effects such as plasma forming the final projectile
3. Since Red5 needs to make money somewhere introduce coloring where it charges into a custom color that you have to buy with $$ making the gun more personal
4. Make the audio while charging get incrementally meaner deeper and angrier with each charge put into it
5. When firing the fully charged Nova Cannon it should knock-back the shooter a small amount. This recoil creates an awesome feeling for the player and creates a higher feeling of reward if a shot is landed.

1375022109.0,1j7sia,Pew Pew Pew: a Rhino Guide,Israndel,16,7,14,"INTRO!

Now before I begin, and always have wanted to make this frame work for me. With all the tumult of balancing and addition of new abilities, this was a hard task, and at first I agreed with most people that the Rhino was effectively unplayable when compared to the more straightforward mammoth. Well, after sticking with the 'frame, testing my resolve (and funds!) with upgraded Rhino abilities, I found some wonderful synergy. My risk was rewarded

HOW? AN EXAMPLE

I'll rattle off my build first, Sundering Wave II, LHMG II, Dreadnaught Plating II, Rhino Passive II, Servos I, Jets I, and Mortar HKM I.

Here's how a fight goes with this; let's go with a chosen squad

1. Put a bunch of lasers downrange as you close in

2. Proactively deploy heavy armor, good absorption indeed!

3. If they are scattering before you, while still protecting the lower half of your body, effectively reducing your hit-box ~50% with proper positioning.

4. If they boldly stand against you, cool!) and increasing damage dealt by some 16%.

After this, your LHMG was made for this; gun them down at range, and if you have a Raptor with you, ask for a Power Field and scythe through the remainders with an infinite-ammo secondary-fire sweep!

Of course if you have your HKM, annoyingly damaging foe, don't feel bad using your HKM to blow 'em away.

BREAKDOWN

Throwing yourself into the thick of combat, reliable damage at any practical range is very satisfying. The synergy afforded a Rhino is not to be understated: with its proactive passive, you can wade into danger that anything but a mammoth would laugh at as an insane move.

But you are Rhino, meaning I get a **26 percent damage boost** when I sunder them after having cornered them with my gravity field!

The Rhino isn't a frame that needs good gear to succeed any more than any other frame is; while the stock mammoth (with the Accord Passive installed) could outlast nearly any other frame

It's important to understand that the same strategies for mammoth will not carry over to Rhino; you are not a pillar of plasma-fire, durable, melee-range PHMG threat. What I'm trying to say is that you are not the Immovable Object; you are the Unstoppable Force.

You are Rhino.",self,t5_2s629,False,,Rhino,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1j7sia/pew_pew_pew_a_rhino_guide/

1360161062.0,17zzyh,PvE Recon seems really underpowered,scotsman4321,11,3,47,"I came back to Firefall after playing many many months ago.  I remember the recon being pretty good, but it seems like waiting is at least twice as long to get the full damage shot.

I do like the abilities long range mine, the skills seem bland/worthless.  

Being the weakest class

I played a lot of PvP last night with t1 recon and as an average player, I see no other class weaker than recon by a large margin.  Sniping the explosive guys, and ranged dudes is important, but having to be scoped in more often than before really makes the recon, the most blind of all classes.  Just my thinking after playing for the last couple days for first time in a long time

*Edit.  After thinking about it some more, you lose all damage for a few seconds once you scope back in.  The best solution would be to have your damage bar move up, whether scoped in, or not.  Rattling off shots could still do a lot less damage, but the first shot after a few seconds should hit hard.  While the same bullet out of a gun ever does different damage (assuming you are hitting the same target) is about as non-intuitive as it gets, forcing a class to be perma-scoped in/half blind to do similar damage to other classes with their main gun is also kind of silly to me.",,self,,

I wanted to validate that this is a reasonable rule and not just me being nit picky before pushing it through though.  So leave a comment or just upvote one there so I know peoples thoughts.

Edit1: This is always a process of thinking out loud.  You guys are the community here not the mods.  We just try to make it a happy place for all.  So far the judgement is to not put it through due to /u/rquiner12's reasoning in the comments.

There are many red links (dead ends with no info) or outdated information on the site.  I think this would be an amazing resource to have for new and old players alike.  But like most

The content is all user driven so there hasn't been much push from R5 beyond saying 'this ones the official one'.  The question is how do we get more attention on the site and get more interest in creating/updating it?

I think we (reddit? firefall community? RED5?) should put forward a weekly 'spotlight' on a topic of Firefall.  Aka, and so on.  Users can then try to put effort into updating such things.

1338501038.0,uek5c,Minor Revisions notes for 31 May 2012,hcranomythgim,9,0,3,"  **Game Changes**

*  ""A Tough Nut to Crack"" will now require that a player completes the objective ""Find the Silicate Deposit Field"" before it will allow the player to progress the main objective.

* Adjusted spawn tables to spawn in less creature nests at once. This should hopefully make the ""spawning in the same spot right after you kill them"" happen less often.

* Tuned the camera and field of view transitions when changing between running

* All deployed turrets should despawn at the end of a match on OCT. No more dying to a turret while staring at the score screen.
*  Roaches will burrow to a player at most 100m away. Players respawning in town should no longer have roaches teleporting into the spawn point with them!

* The login screen will now notify you if you are running a video card driver different than the latest release.

* Optimized lighting effects to increase performance.


   **Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug where changing your toggle settings for zoom would leave you stuck in zoom if you were zoomed in while making the change.

* Orbital Comm Tower forcefields on points B and C should allow you to re-enter your base.

* Fixed some holes in the world.

* Players should be able to deploy the Medium Healthpack Calldown once again.

* The Dreadnaught's Heavy Armor ability should no longer persist when changing battleframes.

* The alarm sounds on Orbital Comm Tower should now reset on round switch.

* Fixed an issue with nVidia 460 SE v2 cards that would cause water to not render properly.

* Fixed issues with returning to open world while in a squad.

* Fixed multiple instances of server crashes.

Firefall uses a rather rare RFC implementation of http traffic in it's networking implementation and this can cause a problem with some firewall and network security scanner implementations. You do not need to turn off your whole security suite

In particular:
Any product that is based on F-Secure core and is brand new does have this problem. We have identified the problem and a initial fix is made. You can get the fix in our beta program already next week (beta.f-secure.com), this will disable the problematic component, leaving rest of the product running:

* run cmd prompt with admin rights
* cd to the installation directory
* type: fshoster32.exe -StopPlugin -plugin:NID

1376238370.0,1k5eep,Firefall Economy Discussion.,BrainKatana,13,5,21,"Last week I wrote [a summary post](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1jmm6r/a_firefall_lament/) on how I felt on the current state of the game. To my surprise it prompted a response from Phobos. I really appreciate his attention to the community and willingness to communicate with us.

To clarify, itemization, crafting, and progression systems intertwine, I think it's something that worth discussing, especially with all the hullabaloo about it from a couple of months ago. As I considered the topic, I realized that permanent item loss wasn't the issue. The issue is the economy as a whole

**The Common Complaint Rebuttal**

Simply saying ""it's not that bad

**The Economy**

Red5 devs are on-record saying that the reason items degrade is to facilitate a virtual economy for crafting and item sales between players. However, because crafting research is a permanent, one-time crystite spend.

**The Messaging (players ""intuiting"" the game)**

Everyone can craft with a relatively minimal barrier-to-capability. Constantly receiving material rewards from ancillary sources (supply crates, it becomes a significant barrier to their enjoyment of the game. I know many of you have felt this way; I've seen the posts here and in the official forums (e.g. ""I feel like I have to be constantly gathering to replace my crafted gear).

**The Marketplace**

*Ugh. It's alpha at best, so I'll talk about it.*

There are quite a few good examples for Red5 to follow here. Guild Wars 2 and EVE Online are two such examples, so I'll just say this: Every single crafting material, crafted subcomponent, and crafting component should be tradable. These lists should be sortable by price and quality. Allowing players to assign their own opportunity cost for rare materials and components (e.g. Baneclaw bits for Mammoth Plating) will help to create a dynamic economy by allowing players who prefer spending time crafting to acquire the necessary materials without being required to engage in combat.

**A Proposed Solution**

* Remove resource rewards from everything but thumping and supply crates. I know this is how it used to be
* Increase thumping material rewards to offset the loss of material rewards from other sources.
* To offset the removal of resource rewards, Downed Thumper, etc mission events. Add a ""bounty"" to Chosen kills that is auto-rewarded.
* As stated above
* Increase crafting slots somehow
* Increase research costs/time and crafting time across the board. Make it more of a barrier to entry than an annoyance.

Under the assumption that these changes are economically balanced by Red5 systems designers, and shard defense (ARES, Incursions, Strike Teams, Invasions). This division will help a virtual economy flourish by creating a resource demand (manufacturers need thumpers) and an item demand (defenders need high quality gear from manufacturers). As an added bonus, manufacturers will be able to focus on manufacturing without having to go farm for specific specialized items (i.e. Hisser DNA). Since the common item needed to progress in any of those 3 directions (combat, gathering, the result would hopefully be an economy that is governed by players' earning power instead of whatever random need the current group of low-end progressing players have. 

Naturally, but I'm sure Red5 has a plan in place that they're constantly executing on, such as the cosmetic bonuses currently available for red bean purchases.

I'm looking forward to what you guys think of this

1) I understand this game is in BETA. How long has it been around?

2) Upon Full Release

3) Currently the game has very basic ""quests"", like ARES Events? 

4) Will there ever be an actual quest system

5) What do we do with the resources that we gather from Thumping? I took them to the manufacturing machine (??) and it only seemed like I could refine them into some other resource...but what do i do with that resource? I haven't quite figured out how to construct items...

6) Speaking of items

7) Thumping: I have participating in many thumping ""sessions"" and one thing I noticed is sometimes there are only a few or weaker enemies

8) Is there currently only one server for everyone to connect to? A game like WoW had 20+ servers, will they always be playing where I am playing or what?

9) Crystalis (??) When fighting enemies, so basically the other players don't see it? I think with Squads, everyone sees it...so do Squads split the loot?

10) What is the deal with ""overloading"" your Battleframe? I heard a warning about this

11) Yes I enjoy the game


EDIT: 12) Does the game support routing game audio through headphones or do i need to set that within Windows before playing? I know it can route voice chat

Thanks everyone for taking time to read this and hopefully answer. Appreciate it.

1370238590.0,1fkdlq,"ReForging, new idea on how Durability should work.",zVulture,11,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1fkdlq/reforging_new_idea_on_how_durability_should_work/

Playing the game recently I have come across the annoyance of repair and it's possible crystite costs. At the current rate of spending crystite for crafting, I wanted to come up with a solution that still kept Durability in the game.

As it currently stands

Create a nanoprint called ReForge that can be used on an equipable item to remake the item:

Input 1 - Equipable Item (weapon/ability/etc)  
Input 2 - Primary Resource *+  
Input 3 - Secondary Resource *+  
Input 4 - Crystite +  
Optional Input 1 - Durability Module  
Optional Input 2 - CPU Module  
Duration: 15 Minutes #  

) * Primary and Secondary resources will change to match the item being put in Input 1. Aka: A Dreadnaught Weapon will require different resources than a Recon Weapon.  
) + Amounts required will be dynamic dependent on: Item's current Durability level % x Item's Tier level x Item Type  
) # Duration should be Low for ease of use

Use:
Remove the constant repair work needed and add a mechanic that is so easy to use people are not as bothered by the costs. Nor will people need to throw away broken items and need to use the complex system to craft new ones (more so for T2). Also this will allow users to add Module(s) to an item even after it has been created. A new item would have all or most of it's durability so the resource cost would be low.

Quality Mechanic up for debate:
The quality of the resources put into Input 2 and 3 can improve/degrade the items quality depending on the resource put into them. This effect should have a buffer value so it doesn't just average the qualities. This prevents people from using the system to cheaply upgrade their gear and doesn't hurt players as bad for using lower quality resources to ReForge with. This also makes just creating a new item a valid option if they want to make a better item.

Modules:
The modules will need to be re-purchased each time the item is ReForged otherwise it will loose the benefit. Lower the current crystite costs of them though so it doesn't hurt so much to ReForge an item this way. Below are a few ideas though on what modules could work with this new system. Values can be adjusted as well as prices with a bit of testing to balance things out.

Re-vamped Durability Modules:  
Slow Use Damage by (5/10/15/20/25 %)  
Slow Death Damage by (5/10/15/20/25 %)  
Slow Use and Death Damage by (5/10/15 %)  

Re-Vamped CPU Modules:  
Lower Mass (10/20/30/40/50%)  
Lower Power (10/20/30/40/50%)  
Lower Mass and Power (10/20/30 %)  
Increase Max Power Buff (5/10/15/20/25 %)   ",self,t5_2s629,1370239009.0,,FFM,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1fkdlq/reforging_new_idea_on_how_durability_should_work/

Preamble over, with a final quality value based on the materials going in, as you'd expect. The Kit could then be used to add back to the Repair Pool of an item, with a very strict limitation: a Repair Kit can only add to the Repair Pool of an item with equal or lower quality.

There could be different levels of kit for different amounts of Repair Pool refilling

However, but without the pain of having to seek out a very specific mineral at a worthwhile quality; you'd have to find that high quality, but not for that one specific mineral. Got some spare 987 Bio-Organic Stintergels? Put it towards a kit to fix your Nighthawk's 903 Rifle!

This would mean that you'd still have to work to keep your good gear, or buy minerals through trading (when that goes in), and still means that the higher your gear's quality, the harder you have to work to keep it usable. Managed to scrape enough 1000 quality together to make the tastiest gun ever? You're still going to have to put in the work to keep it in one piece, but you're not going to have to pray that you can get your hands on that one specific mineral again.

To me, but with much less of the headache associated, and the bonus of making all minerals attractive for people (I don't know about you, but if I'm after something specific and it's not present in decent quality, I instantly feel a tad less inclined to play).

***** Frame progression

Okay so

Battle Frames come with a preset of abilities and weapons

What I mean with crafting and turning knobs is that there is no way to make better weapons with crafting. All crafted weapons trade some stat for another. Technically there are also trait requirements but in practice trait requirements are just another stat since meeting the requirements of a item doesn't mean you don't lose in some other way.

For instance, it will still make you move slower, because of it's increased Mass.

The only way to make your frame better, counter-balance-free, no-down-sides better; is using the traits system. A.K.A. Leveling Up.

So you can't craft a better gun, deal higher damage. And upgrading your Mass trait will always make you move faster, period.

What this tells me is that you should forgo crafting and focus all your attention in leveling up. At low levels you level up by getting XP. XP is always good. At higher levels you are going to have to need specific resources. You need specific types of resources and you are going to want high level ones AND since getting a specific quality of an specific resource is harder than getting generic XP, business as usual. 

You are going to want to focus on Power first and Mass second

[NeonTwister](http://neontwister.blogspot.mx/2013/03/patch-06-upgrading-your-frame-and.html) tells us upgrading is roughly logarithmic, since everything is aimed at nerfing you) then you might decide to do without the last few levels of Power and start focusing on Mass (or vice-versa).

What about cores? Well cores are the only part of the crafting system that doesn't nerf your mobility or damage output. You can craft weapons to be better, investing in a better power plant. The only way crafting is different than trait leveling is that it allows you to further focus on one type of item at the expense of others.

For instance you can focus on crafting servos and jump-jets with higher core requirements so your character becomes more mobile without necessarily getting a better weapon. Or you can chose to neglect your abilities at the expense of your signature weapon.

But of course the logarithmic leveling curve is coming back to haunt you

UNLESS ALL THESE POINTS ARE PLAGUED BY LEVEL CAPS AND PROGRESSION CURVES. Which I expect

***** Suggestions *****

It reminds me of the leveling system of Skyrim where you have 3 standing stones and pray to the one that increases the type of skills you want faster. In this game they'd be Mobility

Ok so it's more complex than that. But in my opinion the progression system in Firefall only serves to obscure the already personal and hard decision of how you want to upgrade your frame.

In my (hopefully) humble opinion

Instead of the current traits and gear system

- Jumping

- Jump-jets

- Max Health

- Health Regen

- Walking speed

- Sprinting speed

- Clip Size

- Max Ammo

- Rate of Fire

- Reload speed

- 1st ability cool-down

- 2nd ability cool-down

- *etc*

Give each stat it's own level and it's own logarithmic curve

Although right now the library of addons is small i was pretty shocked to see that some addons were added to the core of the game.

Like the 1 click party join function was originally an addon that was added to the game as well as another.

2 of the addons i'm using right now is showing the distance to target on mouseover and adding coordinates directly to the hud.  There are complete UI replacements and a couple of other fluffy ones you can check out.

I'm keeping my eye on the surveyor addon that someone is working on.  Will be able to track mineral locations on your map and its shard specific as well.

I would highly recommend downloading Melding which is an addon manager.  Makes it dead easy.

Possible titles: This is Firefall / Welcome to Firefall / ...

**Firefall is Free2Play online action shooter, it would be Firefall.**

The game draws from many backgrounds.  The classes are obviously based off TF2. There are five classes.  I personally loved the Assault, though no knockback.  The engineer, just like in TF2, can put down turrets at strategic points and repair them when damaged.  The recon is a sniper. He is often called the glass cannon of FF: insane damageoutput but a small health pool.  The Dreadnaught on the other hand is a heavy machinegunner. Fatty has a big health pool and is able to get more armor than any other class.  And last but not least the Biotech, a support class with an ability to heal while still being able to output enough damage to be relevant.  The devs also put time into making all the classes enjoyable to play. Its the little details that make them fun to play.  The engineer for example has a shaft like weapon, which gets a damage buff every time you hit. There is no leveling in FF, just tiers.  All the classes start out as Tier 1.  Once you have unlocked all their upgrades

When you first play the game

http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Firefall-Sunken-Harbor-PvP-Trailer_8.jpg

The movement of the game is comparable to Tribes, but it does add depth.  Jumpsuits allow you to build up speed or scale cliffs.  Just like in ET you will be using your movement to increase your tracking, you just wont be doing it only from left to right, you will also end up going up and down following your target to get those sweet juicy headshots. With some practice you can also hoversprint, which is comparable to skiing in Tribes. A neat example can be seen here.


**Why is Firefall worth playing?  The game features two seperate gameworlds.  There is the open world

In the open gameworld, with good resources of high quality and put down your thumper.  What ensues is remniscent of Starship Troopers, with wave after wave of aliens rushing you and your thumper.  Once you start thumping the game sets a good pace and you will be shooting and moving about all the time. You can vary the difficulty of the game by thumping alone or in group or thumping for rare resources at dangerous places.  The reason I actually enjoy the open world part of FF is because your FPS skills translate well into the game.  Its not because you play the game 24/7 and have the best gear, this also means you are the better player.  Aim, gamesense and movement all add up. Since FF is currently still in its beta stage there isnt much content and quests.  Thumping is the basic way to grind for xp and resources to craft, but does so in a really entertaining way.

&lt;Thumper Youtube clip here&gt;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDrTxS9j7p8

On the other hand the game features great PvP modes.  Deathmatch for example, Tier1 battlesuits will always level the playing field, leaving skill to decide who is the best.  You can compare it to ET without xp.  You can also battle it out using T2 frames, though these allow for craftable upgrades so the one who grinds the most will have an advantage.

**Winghaven and Reload have both been playing Firefall with Epsilon for a while and I asked them their impressions of the game.**

Winghaven

&gt;I really love Firefall. After ET it is the game I enjoy playing the most.  I always end up saying 'ok one more PvP and I'll quit' I haven't had this happen to me for years.  Everyone from Epsilon is really enjoying the game and we have huge expectations for the game, but we are having a lot of fun and it isnt even a good competetive mode. 

&gt;The devellopers really listen to the community and seem to know what they are doing. For 2013 there will be a 1.000.000 $ season which means a lot of teams and sponsors will be interested in the game

&gt;Ofcourse there are some things which need improving.  A european server

I've only had a few short hours with all the new shinies and so far I've been pleased. The new xp system feels better than having the arbitrary levelling from before. The game itself feels much faster paced and I *love* the new minigun for the dreadnaught.

There are still some things that I feel need worked on - the UI for instance is often odd (eg. in the battleframe garage I have to click on my arms rather than my gun to change my weaponry) and some things I just don't feel are intuitive enough (eg I unlocked a faster spinning gun but there's no indication that I just innately have the new gun available).

&gt;http://www.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/minor-revision-notes-for-thursday-may-24th.41102/

**Bug Fixes**

&gt;Fixed an error when there was a space after a slash in the chat box.

&gt;Fixed issues where the texture streaming quality setting would be automatically reverted to Highest.

&gt;Fixed problems with deploying Medium Health Pack calldown.

&gt;Fixed issues with AFK not being disabled when moving mouse or keyboard.

&gt;Fixes for issues with Swedish keyboards.



**Game Changes**

&gt;You should no longer see a player's health or name above their head when they are executed and waiting for respawn.

&gt;Modified the way animations decrease their quality over distance to prevent a lot of the popping and skipping.

&gt;The calldown menu will now sort calldowns by name instead of order purchased.

&gt;If the client receives a serious error that wouldn't normally cause a crash

&gt;Improved the graphical quality of Ambient Occlusion.

&gt;Added Battleframe Terminals and Research Vendors to Trans Hub.

&gt;You will no longer be forced into 3rd person camera when interacting with a PvP terminal.

&gt;Resource scan feedback now shows ""Only Trace Minerals Found"" instead of ""100% Thumper Sifted Earth"".

&gt;Sonic Detonators have had their cooldown reduced to 1 second.

&gt;Thumper locations are now ""reserved"" for 60 seconds after a thumper is returned.

&gt;The amount of energy you have left is now preserved when you change battleframes.

&gt;The Medic's heal beam and vampiric beam are no longer healing or damaging players outside of field of view.

&gt;This is a bug that requires time to fix. In the meantime

&gt;Reduced the damage per pellet of the Assault scattershot alt-fire from 74 to 65.

&gt;Increased the accuracy of the Dreadnaught HMG while moving.


**Known Issues**

&gt;Sometimes after leaving a PvP match

I really enjoyed the gameplay. It was great to have a nice change of pace from tab targeting and rooting action combat (Talking about you

The world overall looked pretty nice. Nothing to blow me away

I actually had fun in Team Deathmatch PvP's. 

Here comes my biggest problem and what will probably have me not playing the game come release (or maybe within a few days)

It seems the ""end-game"" via crafting is mindlessly Thumper grinding and doing an ARES if you get bored. Am I mistaken? I felt the HUD was incredibly ugly when I got into the game

I get annoyed just thinking of the crafting. Why cant it just be gather these, and then refining your stuff and just way too many unnecessary quirks to try to make the crafting seem deep when really it's just annoying. And for newer players they probably dont get it at all and have to google or go to websites for help.

I know some people might say ""Sandbox MMORPG's arent just ABOUT the gear"" I know. But people want gear, it's very important to make crafting if atleast tedious, fun. But I feel crafting in this game is tedious and not fun.

anyways. the devs are listening to what u have to say from what i've seen so far. btw. the beta resources turned into beta crystite and then buying an lgv or tex or gliderpads is the best way to make me feel like the game is thanking me for playing the game in the beta. i feel appreciated. if they get rid of the lag and stuff
and for the devs team. 10x man! for a f2p game, cuz the last       skill tree had some red on black colors and i'm color blind so it was difficult for me to see what was the amount of xp needed, and they've change it. don't know if it was for me or some other dudes that are color blind, or they had their own agenda but did it. and yeah u can say it's common sense but i've submitted this to other games in beta state and they didn't do jack about it. 
so bottom line is: look it up. try to get the best out of the ui. and if u have some problems or things that u need to be changed submit a bug report or go to the forums or w/e. and as far as red5 goes. 10x guys for doing a great job. keep up the good work.

Loved the game mechanics wise a few months back. But it needs lots more PvE for sure other than just running around doing 3-5 different dymanic events. I know I saw 'Campaign PvE' or something similar in their roadmap so I just thought I would check in.  I really do not want to log in again until this portion is done.

1355952399.0,154ohc,New Patch Impressions,Esham,6,2,5,"So i got some time last night to play with the new patch.  As a background i have Recluse

I decided to play on my Rhino as  Dreads got a little love in this patch.

Right off the bat i noticed the majority of the map was blue.  Having read the forums enough i had a feeling this would be the case.  With longer lockouts on towers and less pods it really felt like there wasn't much to do.  When a tower did get taken over there was atleast 5 people there to take it back or we would wait for the 5min lockout to end.

Imo i think reducing the drop pod frequency PLUS the longer lockout was a bit too much in regards to content to play.  

Since the map was mostly clear i decided i had better go thump.  Right away i noticed that a new mineral rotation had kicked in.  I actually found some blue silicate (cy-650 or so) which was amazing.  Had a small group of 3 folks improved thumper it a bunch but i haven't played with the material yet.  If past experiences hold true this mineral will be the rare blue mineral of choice for this rotation (last mineral being blue bismuth and coralite).  

A note that was not included in the patch notes was that the thump dump printer is up and running now.  This change i loved as i felt going north was very beneficial but the trek back to copa was always a pain to reload my prints.  This saved a tonne of time as i could bang out a new thumper that i lost with little downtime. 

One thing i forgot to do right off the bat was outfit the hell out of my max constraint gear.  My tigerclaw shot up in power (not really needed imo) as i could put on my best ammo and a 3rd skill without any limitations.  Icing on the cake that is already 3 tiers higher than all the other classes imo.

My recluse got similar treatment but

Onto my Dread.  More damage

Pods and towers were a blast when they were available.  I could walk right into the middle of a pod of chosen and pop heavy armor and go to town.  I am starting to get the timing right though as you need to get everyones attention before activating heavy armor or it doesn't really do much.  But flying in with HMG a blazing and coming out at near full health was so satisfying.  With heavy armor to start and explosive rounds to finish it just worked great.  But the class is still behind in viability.  What feels good on dread feels stupid on other classes. 

All in all i have enjoyed the patch greatly so far.  i wish there was more to do but that will come with time.  Dread feels good but every other class is completely OP now.  Although my dread isn;t fully unlocked so i suspect it will get into the OP territory but not as crazy as say the assault or biotech.

&gt;Army name reservations, and other virtual items will unlock September 24th.

If I follow logic here
* Light Ground Vehicles for all players (special skins for Founders)  
* Rough Army System implemented (so they have a database in-game to reserve army names)  
* A new wave of Cash Shop items (including possible price adjustments)  
* New 'Decorations' for battleframes added to the new you stations (currently only the Founder's insignias)
* A gift system (if not a full trade system)  

~~We also have the video's that have been popping up with new critters so...~~  
Update: These two are programed in-game but no release date has been made for them (estimated PvE Milestone)  
* [Brontodons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XoHFg-a7DA) added to game  
* (Currently un-named) - [The Stuff of Nightmares](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLA-GAW8LE) added to game

~~Going out on a stretch if it's the PvE milestone
Update: Sept. 24th update confirmed for just Founder items.  As they say 'soon'  
* Army content added  
* Army Events added (pushing back the melding or larger thumpers)  
* Relay Towers Improved (fixed so we can actually activate w/o problems)  
* More/larger chosen events (city invasion? really stretching here)

1345671385.0,ynrr3,Biggest Annoyance - T2 Fit limitations,zVulture,8,2,17,"So I recently got more into making a few T2 setups.  Crafting out some amazing items I soon found I was running out of Power (electricity? not in game at the moment).  I find this to be an OK limit to what can be equiped so I looked at my options for fitting.  I found that there was no way to have a T2 improved module (aka + this - 2 other things) be at least neutral (+1 thing 0 other two things) without needing More power than the base module it's made from.  This pushes me to use the non-modified abilities so I don't get the drawbacks.

There are a few options to adjust for this.  The most basic is to allow some of the modules from T1 to cross over.  They cost the same as the ones with drawbacks but only help that stat at a reduced value (50%? 75% of the value?).  This leaves for a broader choice of what players can equip without going over the limited resources.  Also,False,self,t5_2s629,1345671695.0,,FFM,t3_ynrr3
