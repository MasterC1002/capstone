I come from a 70s punk / Detroit garage influenced background while the rest of the guys are more into hardrock a la Turbonegro and straight up heavy metal. We just finished recording and I'd love to hear what you think about our tunes! We'd love to hear from music writers

Oh and on our myspace there's a video where a random girl kisses me during a song at at 00:58. That rocked!
