Yesterday

This isn't the first time I've seen people saying creepy, whee, we figured out where they live! Not only is that really weird and inappropriate, it disrespects the queens when you essentially broadcast where they live and your intentions to find them. It also places the entire fandom in a bad light and affects how queens might react to us.

I'm very glad that this subreddit has not stooped to those shenanigans but please

Edit: This thread kind of went off in a few other directions so I just wanted to say I'm sorry if people's feelings got hurt.  I think some of the other topics (fanfiction, the idea of a drag queen fandom is probably weird in itself! 

My core point was, their feelings and their privacy, first and foremost. I know that there exists consequences of celebrity where their lives are more open that of the average person. That doesn't mean they don't deserve *any* privacy, though, which is something that some fans need to be reminded of at times.  ",,False,t5_2t3or,True

Five of our favorite queens return to choose from promising young queens just starting out but still rough around the edges. They will choose them based on their lip-synch performance alone, I stole it from The Voice.  Each of our five returning queens will choose two baby queens to mentor and coach through a grueling competition of challenges that will require everyone to up their game.  One will Draguate (keeping the word) with Top Honors and become a contestant on full fledged Drag Race.

It opens with Alaska in full camp mode delivering exaggerated vocals on staples such as ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" and original songs such as ""The Gayest Thing You've Ever Seen."" However, but Alaska's voice evolves into a more sincere instrument over the course of the show and by the time she nails her closing numbers (""Dreams"" by Grace Slick, ""Don't Dream It, Be It"" from The Rocky Horror Show) the notion of a an alien creature singing her heart out as she makes her way toward death actually attains some real gravitas. This highlights what a genuine talent and vulnerable performer Alaska can be while never sacrificing her insane antics and truly bizarre characterizations.  

I still feel Drag Race never truly demonstrated the brilliance of Alaska's drag persona -- that of a space alien who comes to earth and emulates (and in many senses miscalibrates) images of and attitudes about glamour. To me, fake everything). What people read her for (the ""rough around the edges"" approach she takes to high glamour) is actually the root of what makes her drag such great art. Rather than covering up the means of her construction, and trying to normalize or naturalize these artificial tools of femininity (makeup, nails, hair), Alaska exposes (and also celebrates) them as the false additives that they are. She loves glamour but never confuses it with reality. It's such a brilliant character, and she's such a bright star.

1363914817.0,1arsms,The Drag Glossary,RuPaulRyan,72,4,88,"I thought we could compile a glossary of words and expressions that are commonly used in the drag community and on the show. Might make things a bit easier for people who are new to the show or who aren't that familiar with the drag scene.

Please feel free to add words that I have forgotten, edit as you see fit.

**Fishy** An adjective that describes a queen who is looking and acting particularly feminine. A fishy queen is a queen who looks like a woman.

**Reading** Reading is the art of craftily insulting other queens. It's not as easy as simply insulting someone (""you're fat"" or ""you're ugly"") - it is much more nuanced and involves really taking a jab at someone's personality and appearance using calculated words. An insult is known as a ""read."" If someone really gets read

**T** The 'T' is the gossip, she might ask ""What's the T?"" 

**Shade** - Shade is basically a collective term for insults and reads. A queen is ""throwing shade"" when she is being particularly mean or rude to another queen. A queen who loves to talk behind another queen's back is ""shady.""

**Gagging** - A queen who does something particularly impressive,' which is to say that they are completely wowed at her performance. 

**KiKi** - When two queens get together to talk, gossip. Not to be confused with...

**KaiKai** - When two drag queens have sex with each other.

**Banjee** - A lot of people use this word wrong. What it actually means is someone who is masculine and can pass as straight. 

**____ the house down** - When a queen does something particularly well, a queen who is particularly good at reading other queens can 'read the house down.'

**Beat** - An adjective used to describe queens (or cisgendeed women) who are particularly attractive and who are great with make-up. Also used a verb

**Cook** - The process of letting all the makeup settle in on the face. 

**Realness** - When a queen tries to imitate a certain genre

&gt;ok let me address the issues of last nights episode…ALL TEA ALL SHADE! 
just so thats its out there and cause there is no explanation. if u feel like reading this than read. if not then i cant make you.
did i say all the things on last nights episode YES! I am a pageant girl who is NOT new to competition. IT CAN GET VERY UGLY! We were so stressed and i let every little thing bother me and needed to shut the hell up. Im not going to make EXCUSES! the things i said and did WERE on the verge of BULLYING and just plain out HORRIBLE. Jinkx was my BIGGEST competition and scared the SHIT out of ME and it kills me that i would have done her the way i did. NO ONE DESERVES THAT! im NOT looking for sympathy nor anyone to feel bad for me. for the people who know me and have met me know exactly how against that i am and how much i go out of my way for people. i am a true believer of actions speak louder than words. Jinkx is an amazing person inside and out and is the exact opposite of me but JUST AS GOOD BABY! she was someone i never saw as a threat from as close minded as i was back then and ended up my BIGGEST competition! In life we learn a lot of lessons through experiences and i learned so much! we all have growing up to do and make MANY mistakes. some of mine just happen to be on national television. if i lost you as a fan i APOLOGIZE FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART! for i would have lost MYSELF as a fan from watching that last night. But i will do whatever it takes to prove to u all that im NOT that person! We all make mistakes. 
SO LET ME ANSWER ALL THE PEOPLES QUESTIONS….
Am i blaming editing? NO because i had to say those things at some point… BUT
am i ashamed of my actions? ABSOLUTELY! 
To some it up before its said again and again … IM NOT asking for everyone to read this and forgive me… but i do want you to know how bad i feel and ashamed i am. un like other queens im being compared to i DO have a heart and my actions were NOTTTT in the right whatsoever!
i love u all and may god help me continue to learn from my mistakes and help me be a better person that what i saw last night.

&gt;love u all

1368060250.0,1dyxcj,What I hope to see for season 6,ZuG,71,14,58,"RPDR is due for a tweaking. The sparkly magic of past seasons was really missing for me this time around

1. RPDR is the only mainstream image of gay culture in the wild right now. I watch the show primarily to see queens at the top of their game that I would never normally know about pushing themselves to even greater heights. Work that! Give queens more than a couple of days between when they find out they made RPDR and when they show up for filming. Give them more time to think and to put together outfits. Give them more days off during filming. Time pressure is good

2. Lose the shady editing. Conflict is important, show what actually happened. There were so many scenes that were obviously cut together that didn't happen just to drum up drama (as an example, Roxxxy snickering at Jinkx's narcolepsy in the sugar bowl never happened. The snickering was about something completely different and was edited to make it look like she was making fun of Jinkx's disorder). RPDR has a smart audience. Most of us are too savvy to be fooled by that shit, so stop it already.

**THAT RED-HAIRED GODDESS!**
Jinkx is a blonde. So how did her Season 5 “Goddess” promo pic end up as a redhead? The producers asked her to bring dresses and wigs for this goddess theme,” which were the types of gowns Jinkx had brought. So they styled her themselves, top to bottom, and put her in what she calls her “Mrs. Lovett” wig, which she ended up loving.  She refers to turquoise blue as her “power color,” so she was perfectly happy to be dressed in it. 


**NARCOLEPSY!**
About the narcolepsy: Is it real? Yep, but she still needs to take naps when she feels it coming on. She told us that Lineysha Sparks was really sweet and every time Jinkx would lay down for a nap, Lineysha would come put a blanket over her. Oh, and you know that “confessional” interview where she appears to nod off and start snoring? ALL REAL. They did trim the end of her sentence – she swears she finished it – but she really did fall asleep during her interview. 


**A LITTLE WHIFF OF HOME**
As the first NW queen, and seeing her made Jinkx feel more comfortable. She also found a few comfortable smells from home: Ivy Winters (“Isn’t he adorable?” she asked us) douses herself in patchouli (very NW hippie, you know), and Pit Crew member Shawn doesn’t wear deodorant … so the two of them added a little fragrant familiarity! 


**SISTERHOOD**
Speaking of Ivy, of course (they’re touring together and have an upcoming show in Pomona!) and Ivy, who I guess is just a wonderful girl, very sweet, caring, and helpful. Ivy is also a very talented seamstress and makes dresses for Lady Bunny!!


**SEW WHAT?**
Jinkx took a few quick sewing lessons before the show started


**ABOUT PENNY**
Jinkx had very nice things to say about Penny Tration, too. And then she offered a quote (which she attributed to “anonymous”) that went something like this: A candle loses nothing when it lights another candle. What a beautiful spirit of giving. She talked about the difference between competing *against* someone and competing *with* them, and how she will only do the latter. Really a very generous soul. There were a lot of really touching moments, to be honest. A lot of talk about family and support, and biological vs. “logical” families. Jinkx is blessed with the support of both, but not everyone is so lucky. 


**PENISES!**
Inquiring minds wanted to know: Is Alaska’s junk really that big?? She smiled so big and leannnnned back on her stool and paused. And then said something like, it was.” The room erupted in laughter and applause. Then she went on to say that the reason Alaska was whipping it around was that after a few hours tucked, a man’s junk gets, well … she compared it to the difference between spaghetti and linguini. One’s nice and long and round, and the other is just flat! You have to kind of air it out and let it recover! 


**THE DRINKS**
And the drinks they’re served while they wait in the Interior Illusions Lounge? Yes, but they’re pretty watered down, she said. They don’t want the girls plastered, but it’s enough to get a little tipsy. 


**THE JUDGES**
Oh, “No, he was too busy reading me for not being stylish enough.” And Michelle Visage? She said, ""here’s the thing about Michelle Visage. Of all the jewelry I brought with me, the only things she absolutely loved was the stuff that came from Claire’s. SO.” 



I’ve met and chatted with Jerick (as himself and as Jinkx) four times now and he is a sweet, but there was so much love and support (and we all applauded and screamed every time he was onscreen) that it ended up being really wonderful for him. He’s decided to come to next week’s viewing party, too, and I plan on being there, so if there’s more dish, I’ll share it!

**Jinkx Monsoon** – Jinkx is the only queen so far who has managed to stay out of the bottom consistently every week because, she acts, she can NAIL an impersonation. But what’s actually impressive about Jinkx is how she deals with things she can’t do. She’s not a seamstress, so she braided her episode 1 outfit together. She’s not a ballet dancer, so she made it her own. She’s adaptive and trusts herself enough to give it her all despite her confidence issues backstage. Her performances not only keep her out of the bottom, but probably should have gotten her at least another win this season, because she’s so close every time. And looking forward to future challenges (a roast, an acting challenge), victorian another. They’ve each been solid but ultimately they lack a certain gag-factor that the judges seem to require. What Michele calls Glamour. And it’s a simple fix: Jinkx could easily ease up on her makeup (which

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 3
http://i.imgur.com/YNPoQPC.gif

Jinkx is in her element. She’s done the best job this week of taking the runway theme and making that into a look, it’s not exactly couture, but Jinkx knows how to construct an outfit and control her level of detail. It’s smart and very easily could have nabbed her the win.

**WORST OUTFIT**: Episode 6
http://dilettwat.typepad.com/.a/6a017d3f6e48be970c017ee9036bce970d-800wi

The GIF says it all. Yawn. This look is everything that is wrong with Jinkx this season. Flat hair, and if she wore this as part of a show (www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0kLCP6fEMs) I’d watch the hell out of it. But not only is it not a piece of wearable art, it didn’t fit the theme. I’ve looked over it a dozen times and still can’t figure out what it is she’s supposed to be highlighting.

Grade: A


**Ivy Winters**—Ivy has that rare mix of performance ability and fashion sense that promises great things. She can sing, an outfit, a choreographer and she can turn it out. But as we’ve seen from her Snatch game and a bit from her general behavior backstage, she lacks improvisation skills and a genuine personality that we can see (her runways all tend to show the same performer-face that weirdly doesn’t move too much). And given the fact that there are three more acting challenges, one of which is live, it’s risky. Personally, I hope she makes it far. I’d love to see how she handles the make-a-dress and ball challenges

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 6
http://i.imgur.com/L08Y46P.jpg

Such a hard choice, along with her hair-frame, actually highlights her face, which was the challenge.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 3
http://i.imgur.com/OgNUTat.png

Not exactly bad. Just less interesting than the rest of what she’s showed us. Love her runways.

GRADE: B+

**Roxxxy Andrews**—Her greatest strength is her personality. She’s uninhibited and bold when she needs to be, she’s a Queen in transition. Where she once depended on big hair and heavier makeup and a generous silhouette, her recent weight loss (Go her!) has given her a newfound confidence that doesn’t necessarily match up with her experience and the drag she has to work with. But when she shows the new her, the her who isn’t afraid to have fun and show off, she shines through better than almost any other queen, and that’s what the competition is all about.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 1 (duh)
http://i.imgur.com/9W1smR8.png

It’s goth. It’s glam. It’s complex. It’s elegant. And most of all

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 4

I couldn’t get a good image of this due to this week’s 30 SECOND runway, which in this case was poorly cut, poorly fit, and ultimately boring.

Grade: B

**Alaska**—I want to talk about Alaska. Because I personally feel the judges have been incredibly misguided in their critiques. Alaska is smart and funny and most importantly, but the evidence doesn’t exactly support that. All that aside, she hasn’t shown us the strongest runway presentations, often relying on the same super-slim silhouette and signature wiggle. Which, being a performer, I can understand. Still, if she’s going to go further

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 3
http://i.imgur.com/0R53Dkb.png

Here, complex, editorial, and designed to stand out from the rest of the crowd, and this week should have been very close between her and Jinkx and not Detox (sorry ‘bout it).

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 5
http://i.imgur.com/5RK3Ef7.gif

She’s going for a character here, unlike above, doesn’t have a solid outfit to back it up. Here she’s trying too hard to give the judges too many things and fails to please, despite how cute she looks.

Grade: B-

**Detox**—For a queen who claims to do it all, she shines.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 4
http://i.imgur.com/JTlABY7.png

God. Damn. This look has it all. The color, and the fact that it is a look tailored to the hint of 60’s suggested by the ballet challenge. It’s incredibly smart and is exactly what a winner would wear.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 5 (with Ep 4 comparison!)
http://i.imgur.com/xkwIKdg.jpg

I couldn’t tell, but it gets lazy, and she knows it. Notice how the whole thing is one giant arrow pointing to her face? That’s probably not an accident, but her silicone here doesn’t make up for it.

Grade: C

**Alyssa Edwards**— We have a lot of fun with Alyssa and her faces, and she’s clearly the best dancer, but she’s been carried through a lot of the acting challenges by either immunity (Katy Perry) or by her willingness to power through with the funny (Singing). Which is a great quality to have and she’s deserved to be safe every time. But once the weaker queens are gone, that’s not going to be enough to compete with the real performers, and that puts her in a tough position.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 6
http://i.imgur.com/y25MENu.png

This gives a great example of all of Alyssa’s best qualities. She gives great face, legs… and here she has the good sense to cover up what doesn’t work as well while still giving a silhouette.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 5
http://i.imgur.com/S9z6LIA.jpg

And here’s everything wrong with Alyssa’s look. Flat hair

Grade: C-

**Coco Montrese**—She’s had to lip-sync twice and, but she shies away from challenges she should be able to do very well at. She’s made some smart choices and they’ve paid off in a big way, but when Coco is out of her element or feels a lack of control, she has a tendency to check out, and this places her in the bottom and in the prime spot to go home soon. Likely, though, she’ll stick around a little longer. She absolutely kills at lip-syncs and if she deigned to put in HALF of that energy into a challenge (like her Leshauwn Beyond)

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 2
http://i.imgur.com/Q1J0y6o.png

Personally, and that counts for something, I guess.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 3

I’m not going to put up a picture of her Pedo-Realness look. Suffice it to say it was a bad choice with a worse pay-off.

* First we as mods want to keep the subreddit as free from sexism

**As the queens have said in the show:** *This is the LAST place where close-mindedness is tolerated*.

* We realize that there are specific LGBT* issues that many of you are not familiar with

* I expect you could find better discussion in /r/lgbt
**We have never had to remove a user from this subreddit due to problems beyond spamming or hate-trolling** but we are not above doing so if we feel as though someone is making others feel unwelcome with their language.

*On that note

Love you all! Remember: this subreddit is as much yours as it is ours. Keep it fierce,False,self,t5_2t3or,False,,,t3_180gb9

I'm doing a re-watch for confessional outfits to see what 'confessions' are from which time-period. I'll be updating as I go, here are my findings. The outfits will be in order of first shown and will be marked with a (minute:second) time stamp to track how many confessions are in that outfit. This is just to get a rough feeling of the order the confessions were filmed

Added info: Most of the second confessional outfits are worn in 17:44 in the Werk! Room after the goyls get out of drag! So, I'm guessing that maybe each work day ends with a confessional? At 27:19, many of the girls are wearing their boy outfits that are also in some confessionals. Either that, or they re-wore boy-clothes a few times.

EDIT! I've made a 2nd! Find it here:http://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/1brhmm/episode_2_confessional_notes/

  I have never done drag, and The Lady Chablis that took me in and made me feel welcome, and loved, and just made me feel GOOD ENOUGH. I cherish the memories of wild road trips with trunk loads of drag. The absolute fun I had with my friends in countless crammed gay bar dressing rooms is something I well never forget. I am who I am today because of the love and kindness those goddesses gave me.
  All that being said....HONEYS...I have met and encountered drag queens so vicious and despicable that my dick wanted to tuck itself in my butt hole and and all the hairs on my body just wanted to go up to Jesus! I remember those nasty queens. They were walking nightmares. I am telling you all here today I get the same heebie-jeebies every time Co Co opens her mouth.
  Her dry tears on the latest episode of UnTucked just chilled me to the bone! I honestly believe there is some nasty stuff going on in that head. She sends up all of my red flags and then just rips them to shreds and burns them! I would not want her to be my friend. I would not want her to be my neighbor. I wouldn't even want to be in the same check out line as her. I have seen queens like her over and over again and again. They thrive on drama and hurt feelings. They are emotional vampires! They suck everyone around them into a tornado of deceit and self loathing.
  CoCo is not FIT to win this title. Absolut should not give her money for a tour. She DOES NOT represent the love and joy of drag.

So here I go:

I am a person who is at first very closed up, I think of my drag-self. I am sometimes weak, and shy, but being a drag queen you cannot be either of those things. The drag queen that lies inside of you, should bring out the best of you, and should bring you strength when you are not.

Sharon Needles was quoted saying how Aaron (her boy counter part) is very sensitive

So when you are in times of doubt, use the drag queen inside of you, and know you are FIERCE, SICKENING and.. bitch... you BETTA WERK.

If I missed you, feel free to message me anytime! And remember, even if you didn't submit an introduction, you still have until this Friday to submit a lipsync video. After Sunday evening, submissions are **closed**. First category is Queens' Choice, so pick your favorite lipsync tune and show off.

Oh

Enjoy!

(And try not to throw *too* much shade

**Edit** **for** **important** **reminder** : It had been stated at some point in one of the pre-show posts that in order for it to be a lipsync video, in terms of making your video line up. Please consider this when making your lipsync videos, and if anyone who's already turned one in wants to replace it, go for it.

*Also, that's fine, BUT you must also upload at least a segment of raw footage as ""proof."" Now everyone can sound awesome but also prove they were syncing. Yay, everyone is happy!

-I think Jujubee is overrated and she got way too far in season two

-I feel Raven was way more bitchy than Tyra

-Tyra deserved to win her season

-Tatianna was not that bitchy and I feel like she's undeserving of the hate she gets

-The hate fest against Serena ChaCha in Untucked was unnecessary and completely uncalled for.

So I was just thinking: Coco is all happy about sending her home on that lip sync
 I am sorry, I have a twitter list for queens, and after every episode, Coco was just ready to read and fight with fans (Particularly after the ""What's a Little Edie?"" failure in Snatch Game). Alyssa was nicer, and she even tweeted the ridiculous apology to Katy Perry (I mean she was horrible but so have been many).

All I am saying is: Alyssa, you knew reading was a game. I can't believe you put up with Coco and didn't hid her highlighter from her.

Follow me here:

Episode 1 has 14 queens.

Episode 2 has 13 queens.

Episode 3 has 12 queens.

...and so on

Now

But our [singing-challenge screenshot](http://dilettwat.typepad.com/.a/6a017d3f6e48be970c017ee7a04274970d-800wi) from the opening flashes of Episode 1 only showed eight queens

Also of note: since its inception, and 4 all had a different number of episodes; the episode with nine queens remaining has always been the Snatch Game. Set as Episode 5 this season, though (again, from the episode-and-judge pairings), means that there should be ten queens in this year's Snatch Game.

In summary: assuming one elimination per episode

**Episode 5 mathematically has 10 queens

**Episode 6 mathematically has 9 queens

So here's my crazy theory:

**Episode 3 or 4 is going to be a double-elimination.** Will it be planned and announced

How does that work out for the rest of the episodes, a clip show 13th, and the finale is number 14.

So

Episode 1 has 14 queens.

Episode 2 has 13 queens.

Episode 3 has 12 queens.

Episode 4... let's call this our double-elimination. 11 queens enter

Episode 5

Episode 6

Episode 7 has 7 queens.

Episode 8 has 6 queens.

Episode 9 has 5 queens.

Episode 10 has ...5 queens again. This is the Carmen/Kenya Put-a-Straight-Guy-In-Drag comeback episode.

Episode 11 has 4 queens. It's the Ball challenge.

Episode 12 has 3 queens. It's the music video. Winner revealed at the finale

I've seen this question asked a few times and I usually write a lengthy response to try and explain the phenomenon of Alyssa stans.  I thought maybe we could just have a discussion about it to refer to when someone asks!  Here is my little write up about her.

**Always and Forever: Alyssa Edwards!**

Alyssa is a cult hit.  There hasn't really been another Queen I can easily compare Alyssa to on the show

**Aesthetic**

Purely judging a book by its cover, though.  She'd do well making friends with Raven for a hand in styling, since she seems to want to have a ""dark lady"" look sometimes.

From an aesthetic perspective, nor did she look cheap.  I guess she compares best in this category to Carmen Carerra.  She has an aesthetic, but it's not always something to write home about.

**Talent Portion**

Alyssa is a magnificent dancer, acting or (scripted) comedy.  Rare is a triple-threat on Drag Race, Willam and Shangela are arguably the only real ones we've seen thus far.  That's another discussion.  Many are the queens who are **awesome** at one thing, but mediocre or terrible at most others.

This is why the overly ironic ""Acting"" segment on the most recent Alyssa's Secret was funny.  It's campy humour; Self-depreciating

**Rivalries**

Before there was CoLyssa/PissyCo, Raven vs Tati, Everyone vs Rebecca.  In the long run, the fans *tend* to favour the queen who seems less invested in the feud, or less affected by it.

Alyssa was like an inverse of Coco.  Coco was soooo bothered by Alyssa.  Comparing that to other queens.  Phi2 and Tati especially became highly emotionally invested in their feuds.  Alyssa continued to engage Coco's drama

It was the competition itself that really pulled Alyssa apart.  Coco certainly tried to make it seem like it was all about Coco

**Personality**

This is where we meet the nuances that seal the foundation of Alyssa stans across the world.

I think it was Jinkx that said, and makes herself giggle far more often than your average person.  She strikes me as living in a world of rainbows and unicorns far more than Jade Jolie ever did, no t no shade!

Alyssa is a self-contained accidental comedy.  What's so unusual, like Alaska, Jinkx and Sharon all have(*).  She really just seems to be happy in her own ~~shoes~~ballerina slippers.

(*) - I just wanna say that I am not trying to say something bad about Alaska, though, and it isn't part of the story Alyssa tells.  It's an interesting difference, to me.

Paraphrasing my favourite comment about Alyssa from reddit:

""She always rubs her hands together when she laughs.  I can't see her hands in this clip but I know she's doing it

Alyssa has a lot of odd mannerisms.  Her mirror-faces (which are seen just as often when no mirrors are present)

Alyssa brings up some Poe's Law feelings.  Does she know she's odd?  Maybe she does

Whatever the answer is

The magic of Alyssa is not now she compares to the other queens, Sharon, Alaska, (all the queens really), Alyssa's camp harkens back to a figure like Little Edie.  She lives in a world we cannot see, and it's fabulous.  Watching Alyssa gives us a tiny peephole into that fabulous world, and we relish that experience.

I'll leave off with some of Alyssa's one-liners

&gt; He was the one backstabbing me behind my back!

&gt; What the hell you squirpin' like a chirpin' like a bird!

&gt; Sit yo' ass down and shut the hell up

&gt; Sorry

&gt; Not ohn tonoiiight!

&gt; I don't get cute; I get drop-dead gorgeous.

&gt; Get a grip

&gt; Awlroiiight.

&gt; Look how orange you fuckin' look!
