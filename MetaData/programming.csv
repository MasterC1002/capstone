Here's the whole story: http://www.theweinerworks.com/?p=86

***********

My sites are down

Dear dude who keeps hacking my sites
A lot of people would take this opportunity to rant about hackers being dickheads. I'm not going to do that. It's unproductive

That said

First, you decrease my income, and thereby decrease my ability to pay for these people.

Additionally, might bring together one or two dozen talented people putting in their spare time for something they love. When you mess with my revenue stream, you also jeopardize that. Again, regardless of how you feel about me or that project, what you're doing poses potential harm to a lot of nice, intelligent, hard working people.

Whenever you knock down my servers, and Weinersmith. All of these are sites that I, James, Chris Jones, and Kelly work on without making much of return, and all of them are educational sites. When you down these, the way I see it

I don't consider myself to have a great amount of influence over the way people behave, and encouraged them to stay in difficult academic programs. I don't believe for a second that they did these things BECAUSE of me - nobody does anything hard without putting in the bulk of the effort  personally. But, I do believe SMBC provides a helpful service to a lot of good people, and I'm very lucky to be the conduit for that service. When you down my site (or any of the others), this goes away.

I suspect a lot of the above could be said about many websites, which provides nothing but jokes and information.

Lastly, and for everyone who works with me. Right now, because of this latest attack, my brother (who was at work, and who has two lovely kids) had to run home to deal with this problem. In other words - when you attack my site, you're not just attacking some abstract thing on the Internet. You're causing physical distress to a lot of people who don't deserve it.

So please

Thanks
Zach Weinersmith

* [dragon fractal clock](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock.php) (clock) is a clock that counts down to the end of the hour in the shape of a dragon curve. Handy for counting down to the end of a boring lecture/lesson/meeting/party.

* [sierpinski clock](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock3.php) (clock3) is a clock that (again) counts down to the end of the hour

* [binary solo](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock7b.php) (clock7b) is a binary clock (that's pretty much it). To be honest

* [timedrain](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock4.php) (clock4) is the one I'm happiest with — you can watch your seconds (and minutes and hours) slowly drain away. Depressing and fun

Any successful sustainable file sharing needs to offer the following features:

-High performance (this is why Kazaa, and Rapidshare all did so well in their respective heyday periods, slow will always fail like [Freenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet) and [Tor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network\))'s current state)

-Anonymity between the uploaders and the downloaders to prevent MAFIAA B.S.

-Useful search tools (any number of solutions for this

-[Poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_group_efforts_against_file_sharing#Peer-to-peer_network_poisoning) resistance (basically

-Incentives to share (the BT trackers get this right)

-All traffic encrypted to prevent ISPs and proxies from observing traffic (Tor/Freenet style to keep everyone that forwards traffic blind)

-Prefer to keep everything internal to the network and have no concept of exit nodes (like [Tor's hidden services](http://www.torproject.org/hidden-services.html.en) or something similar)

-Open to anyone that wants to join without invites (this eliminates [friend-to-friend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend)/[darknets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing\)))

-Flexible routing and robust storage (DHTs are great for this

-Completely open source and decentralized so no companies can be sued to take the network down (BT already figured this out). More on this here: http://www.eff.org/files/p2p_copyright_wp_v5_0.pdf

There may be more requirements, with anonymous communication and incentives to upload, downloaders can just leave all of their files available permanently, vastly increasing the performance, which further adds to the utility in a positive feedback loop.

Obviously, I think they will be overcome in the relatively near future. This is a classic example of how arms races promote technology. I feel that without extremely draconian laws that outlaw cryptography and network neutrality, there is absolutely no way for big content to win this in the long run. Digital information is, for all practice purposes, a [public good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) (it is non-rival and non-exclusive thanks to the ability to make infinite copies for almost free). The legal system is set up assuming that IP is a [private good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_good) and will not change unless it is forced by outside pressure. Eventually, they will either accept file sharing or not. But if the technology makes enforcement impossible, it really doesn't matter.

One protocol that looks promising to me is [BitBlinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitblinder). I have not been able to test it yet though (haven't got an invite)

Please reply with comments on the issues I mentioned, and anything else related.

Note: I am not here to discuss the morality of file sharing. I am not even a file sharer myself (haven't even used BT in a couple years). I just want to see innovation and see some good old fashioned [creative destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction). In Reddit's meme language: I just want to see the world burn.

Edit: added links.

Edit 2: Holy shit. Great response. Thanks for contributing and keep the good info coming. I'm going to try to comb through this info and hopefully can refine this idea further. Maybe a Wiki page is in order. Any suggestions for where to post?
