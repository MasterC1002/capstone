###PENS

The most popular beginner pen around here is the [Lamy Safari](http://www.lamyusa.com/fountain_main_safari.php). It's cheap ($20-$30), an aluminum safari, or the [Lamy Vista](http://www.lamyusa.com/lamy_fountain_L12_vista.php), the see-through version. (This is what I use).

A brand-new one that's been popular recently is the [Pilot Metropolitan](http://www.gouletpens.com/Pilot_Metropolitan_Fountain_Pens_s/1336.htm). I've never used one

Other inexpensive

* [Parker Urban](http://www.parkerpen.com/#/en/collection/Urban-Standard/Muted-Black/Chromed-Trims/Fountain-Pen)

* [Kaweco Sport](http://i.imgur.com/UX5Ty.gif ""Can't directly link to website"") A compact pen

* [Platinum Preppy](http://platinumpenusa.com/preppy-fountain-pen/) One of the least expensive FP's out there. ($3-$5)

* [TWSBI Diamond 580](http://i.imgur.com/6LRxP.jpg) High quality

* [Parker 51](http://i.imgur.com/yO3Lz.jpg) Unarguably the most popular vintage pen. Hasn't been in production for four decades

* I'll add additional suggestions from the comments here.

###INK

Now, which are disposable things full of ink that you pop in the pen and write with. They're convenient, but pricey ($25-$35 per oz of ink). All of the pens above except the Sport, use proprietary ink cartridges. For other pens, an ""international standard"" cartridge exists.

The (recommended) alternative is to what's called a [converter](http://minus.com/lhBcgR0fLxWBr). This is a small, up to $16 for specialty inks). These are normally sold separately, for about $5.

Higher-end pens may use other filling mechanisms.

If you use a converter you can use hundreds of different inks, to see which kind you like the best. Most people on here prefer Noodler's inks because of their [many colors and special properties](http://noodlersink.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/103012_noodlers-ink-properties.pdf), but so far, my favorite has been Private Reserve DC Supershow Blue. If you want to write in hot pink, invisible, whiskey-scented, fraud-proof, now you can. The link above goes to a shop where you can buy 2ml ink samples
One option is to use a syringe (preferably an [ink syringe](http://www.gouletpens.com/Goulet_5ml_Ink_Syringe_Set_p/inksyringe.htm)) to fill up your cartridges/converters. It's a nice accessory to have

Warning: Only use fountain pen inks. Other inks can clog up your pen.

###NIBS

Finally, which, along with the ink you use, determine the thickness of the lines you write. Stock nib sizes normally range from EF (extra fine), to B (broad), but outliers exist ([0.004""](http://www.richardspens.com/?page=pens/nibs.htm) to [6mm](http://www.gouletpens.com/Pilot_Parallel_Fountain_Pen_6_0mm_Blue_p/pn90053.htm).) I'd recommend either fine or extra fine to start with, which will produce something about as wide as your standard ballpoint pen. Some brands use interchangeable nibs

For specialty nibs, if you're looking to write beautifully, like [this](http://imgur.com/UxTtp.jpg) (italic nib) or [this](http://imgur.com/QUz8C.jpg) (flex nib). A cheap italic pen is the [Pilot Plumix](http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/56-Plumix.aspx?ProductId=168), and an inexpensive flex pen, is [Noodler's Ahab](http://noodlersink.com/whats-new/noodlers-new-ahab-is-almost-here/). If you'd like to compare different stock nib, Goulet Pens's [Nib Nook](http://www.gouletpens.com/Nib_Nook_s/1114.htm) is a great tool.

###PAPER
Unlike the popular ballpoint pen which uses a thick, watery ink. On absorbent paper, this can cause a few problems:

* [Feathering](http://i.imgur.com/RKutP.jpg) when the ink spreads after writing.

* [Ghosting](http://i.imgur.com/mZOSm.jpg) when the ink can be seen through the paper.

* Bleed-Through - where the ink soaks through the paper.

Higher end papers are thicker and less absorbent, less-absorbent paper often means longer drying time for ink.

The most popular paper high quality brands around are [Rhodia](http://rhodiapads.com/) and [Clairefontaine](http://www.clairefontaine.com) (which I think are owned by the same company).

Now, there might just be some of the aforementioned effects, and it happens with some inks more than others. Personally, I don't think you need to *start* with nice paper, but it's nice to pick some up when you're more in to the hobby.

###CAVEATS

There's a lot of valuable additional information in the comments.

Warning: this is an addictive hobby. I started with a cheap [Pilot Plumix](http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/56-Plumix.aspx?ProductId=168)

Also, ink, converter, and paper, there's a [Lamy bundle](http://www.gouletpens.com/Lamy_Starter_Set_p/package-lamystarter.htm), along with [other bundles](http://www.gouletpens.com/Packages_s/35.htm) here.

If anyone has any questions/suggestions/corrections

*More nib/paper info to come.*

In a nutshell, between the stock cartridge, converter, Faber-Castell ink, and medium nib.  I cleaned it, ran ink through it, tried to manipulate the nib

I ordered a [Lamy Fountain

Well, filing the chamber.  After a couple of shakes, the ink started flowing and the first thing I did was sign my name.  Perfect.  I wrote some long sentences.  No skipping.  Everything looks great.  I wouldn't change a thing.

1360208524.0,181laq,Putting Noodler's Bulletproof Ink to the Test: An Experiment,RgyaGramShad,47,6,17,"I decided to see just how ""bulletproof"" Noodler's bulletproof ink is. I chose one I just got

It's a nice black with hints of green (that unfortunately don't show in the scan.) It flows a little less readily than other Noodler's inks

Now, bleaches, alcohols, solvents, petrochemicals, oven cleaners, carpet cleaners, and of course…they are also waterproof once permitted to dry upon cellulose paper.""

So, and rubbed over the ink for a bit, then any residue was left to evaporate, or wiped off after 15 minutes.

http://i.imgur.com/IpDwqwr.jpg

So, and the control. Neither of these were treated in any abnormal way.

* UV: Ink was placed in a high-intensity UV curer for five minutes. No visible change.

* Chem1: Methanol. The ink lost some of its saturation

* Chem2: Acetone. Ink slightly lightened

* Chem3: Isopropyl Alcohol. Only slightly affects ink.

* Chem4: Liquid Flux. It violently attacks metals

* Chem5: White vinegar. Surprisingly effective

* Chem6: Bleach. Most of the fading is from ink-bearing pieces of paper coming off during application. The left side should be a more accurate representation of its effects.

* Chem7: Oxidane

Caveat: This paper is very unabsorbent. If the ink were allowed to penetrate more

Edit: I just tried the flux on some ink on normal paper. Didn't even fade the ink. I guess that's the key with this ink

So, and it came off pretty easily. I considered also testing this ink vs Hydrofluoric acid (think Breaking Bad) and Phosphoric Acid (Rust removing gel), but I value my health more than my curiosity.

So I went to Daiso today and picked up one of their [Riviere PTR 200](http://imgur.com/YqED9ey) fountain pens. After getting home and writing with it a bit I noticed that it is MUUUCH smoother and less skippy than my Lamy Vista. At first I chalked it up to maybe the Daiso pen being a ""medium"" and the Vista being a Fine

Could this possibly mean that the cheap 1.50 Daiso pen has a better nib than my Vista or maybe my Vista's nib has just been messed up this entire time and never noticed it because it was my first fountain pen?

Reddit has probably been one of the most useful websites I've ever encountered, but for me that is simply too much work and I merely choose to lurk on the forums there. I've made an account there, but cannot be bothered to actually post because FPN simply does not feel as inviting as this subreddit does, IMO.

I imagine I'm not the only person out there with this opinion. This is one of the few communities where I feel a certain level of privilege and importance to being a part of, and the hobby is as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be. For me, that's something really special. I restore fountain pens and haven't ever purchased a pen for over $150, but comparing that to other hobbies, I think that is cheap and intreresting, has a rich history, and is appreciated on a personal level for me. I do it for myself and nobody else. Buying a new pen for me is like a weekend vacation that I get to go on with all expenses included. For other hobbies I've done like cologne, music, fountain pen collections are honestly one of the more reasonable hobbies out there

I honestly love you guys. I do more of the vintage fountain pen collecting so some of you may not know where I'm coming from or me on the same level as me. The only modern pens I've ever purchased were a $10 jinhao, but the way I look at things I can restore a vintage pen for less than buying a twsbi vac or lamy safari or any other pen. There's a few I cant really compete with and will probably buy soon, but in all honesty I've basically avoided modern pens all together. For me, converters, pistons ,and other mechanisms just don't work as well for me as the lever, vac, and other filling mechanisms of the past. Does anyone else feel this way? What would you guys consider to be the advantage of modern over vintage pens

I hope you guys keep up the good work. You're the only subreddit I check on a daily basis besides my ""front page""

I have a slightly heavy hand.  The Platinum can put down finer lines than the average in these pictures.

I used equal pressure to write both samples but the Platinum is a bit more sensitive to pressure.  The Platinum has a 14k nib.  My hand is a bit heavy so there is some variation in the Platinum samples.  If you have good control you can maintain ultra fine lines.

I think the nib tip profiles are really interesting.  The Lamy has a clear ball of tipping.  The Platinum has been ground down significantly.  (I haven't modified either of these.)

http://www.levenger.com/Pens---Refills-8/Fountain-Pens-831.aspx  has some decent pens, organizational stuff, furniture.  I had a 10 or 12 year old, monogrammed ""TrueWriter"" from them that had a problem.  They replaced it, and the new one had the monogram too.   
.  
I'm also a fan, which has a bunch of pens  inks, and they have a semi-annual FP sale.  I don't think they have a web presence, but if you're in town check them out.  
.  
Also here in Seattle
.    
Again, and will definitely shop there again.  However I see them mentioned here so often, I wanted to make sure folks were aware of some of my other favorite places to shop.

I'm a computer scientist by major and trade, but I also like to have a book in my back pocket all the time. 

I'm looking for something that's a good mix of cheap, and fits in the back pocket, but I'm inexperienced about paper for fountain pens.  I tend to do things like glue pockets or elastic or use existing pockets for a wallet too: I find I don't misplace the notebook as often as my wallet, and no one thinks to steal it.

Do you guy have any suggestions?

1. This will be my everyday office pen.  I dont want something that is going to go boom if I drop it.  (I realize bad things happen if you drop it on the nib

2. It needs to work on all sorts of paper.  When I order this pen, or drawings for edit, or graph paper and I would rather find something that works well with everything.

3.  I write small, or at least write like one.  It would also be great if it could handle drawing shapes and sketches well.

4.  I would prefer to be able to use cartridges as well as a converter if possible

5.  Since I am still getting into this I would prefer it be relativly affordable.  Say $50 or less.  Though I could pay more if it was exactly what I needed.

I currently have only two pens.  Both Lamy Safari, but it writes like a broad nib from the look of it.  Its thicker than any ballpoint I have in my office.  It also feather's ink quite a bit on printed sheets.  The EF is nice, but its very scratchy on regular paper and skips a bit during sketches.

I understand that ink can make a huge difference in this

Any advice is appreciated

**EDIT**

Wow.  I had really not expected quite so many responses.  Thank you all for the advice.  I think I am probably going to try the a Pilot

So a large amount of people have the Pilot Parallel calligraphy pen. But it comes with a useless 'cleaning converter'. So we're forced to use cartridges

Today
Before and after:
http://imgur.com/Lz3WoXO

Anyway
http://imgur.com/okivUEi

Things required:
http://imgur.com/DbRnNMV

a) Sandpaper

b) Thin rod

c) Sticky tape

d) Pilot parallel section (barrel not required...)

e) Cleaning converter.

f) Needle or something similar. I used a mechanical pencil's fixed sleeve.

Steps:

1. Grab the needle or similar implement. Poke around the inside of the converter around the plastic area. You'll notice that Pilot has included a lip on the inside of the converter. This blocks the converter from actually sitting properly. We're here to grind the lip away.

2. Tear off a thin strip of sandpaper and wrap it around the rod. Or not

3. Grind away the lip.... stop every once in awhile to check whether it is able to fit onto the section properly. If it's too tight (when it fits the nipple)

4. After grinding away the lip

WARNINGS:
I'm not responsible for you breaking the converter. If you push the sandpaper too far down

While cutting the threads something went awry (I fixed it for the next barrel I made) and the thread cutting tool GOUGED into the barrel hard.  In hindsight I should have just trimmed the barrel back a bit and extended the threads farther up the barrel, the new one is better.

But what about the blue pen?  Check it out….

[Blue Barrel End](http://newtonpens.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_6084.jpg)

Yeah, and cut it away from the rest of the blank.  The problem?  I cut too close to the hole, and when shaping, I noticed how incredibly thin the end of the barrel was.  So I took a drill bit and shoved it through all the way, breaking the end away as you see in the picture above.  The end was so thin I could push it in with my thumb nail.  Now it serves as the tester pen for my #5 nibs.  :)

After my uncle let me use his 45 flighter I reconsidered my stance on hooded nibs (for the better) anyway, still nothing. I was understandibly upset to the point where I almost went back to return it. But as luck would have it I compared my 51 to others online and found that my nib stuck out waaaay too far. After a firm push (cushioned by a cloth) I got the nib into the right position and BOOM! suddenly it wrote perfectly! I feel stupid now but whatever, a misaligned nib is nothing to cry over. Anyway, now that it was at the perfect wetness I started having lots of fun, I understand now why everyone hypes these pens so much!

I don't know what started it but last week I had this deep desire to buy a fountain pen. I haven't used one for about 13 years

So I went shopping and since I live in Korea the selection was reduced and everything was a good 40% more than you'd pay at home

I would have bought the Sonnet had they had the red laquered one but all they had was the silver and despite it writing like a dream I didn't fancy the looks of it much. I also tried the Pelikan M140 but it was really harsh and scratchy.

Aaanyway. i just wanted to say that I'm absolutely 100% addicted to FPs already and now I'm looking for my next pen. I just spoke to my mum and I think I have a couple of old parkers from about 18 years ago which she will have a root around for

I've also been trying to learn cursive which has already improved my DREADFUL handwriting tremendously. 

Here's a pic of the pen and my attempt at cursive after a couple of days practice. Please ignore the spelling mistake.

It started back in 3rd grade, now in Islam, you're expected to use your right hand for everything, including writing, so, I was expected to conform to that policy, which I did. Que nasty handwriting, and cramps. My grandfather, Bangladesh, and thats how I started.


Fast forwards to 5th grade, and spills ink all over in class, this is in 2008, and fountain pens get *banned* from class. Heartbroken I write a letter to the teacher offering to instruct other who jumped the ""Bay"" for a fountain pen, and were making a mess of their clothes, as well as making a case for fountain pens, mentioning my left handedness. She declines instruction, the kid and his buddies never used fountain pens again, beautiful design


Boom, all the teachers want a typed report now, that and my struggle against puberty very much put the fountain pen out of use,



Now in 8-9th grade, assault rifles, submachine guns, whew. Living in New York made this risky, as we have a ban on anything that looks like a real gun, most states accept the orange tip, New York State requires the entire gun to be painted a bright color, being teenagers, which my family, I was pretty upset


Now I have too much time in my hands, I needed something to do with my free time, my mother suggested getting back to my pen hobby, and with some cash from all those airsoft gun sales, why the hell not? Got myself and a Pelikan M600 White Tortoise, fell in love at the Fountain Pen Hospital in Manhattan. I'm starting 10th grade this September, and my collection has blown



Some of you may question as to how a fifteen year old (seeing my other posts) has so much in pens, the airsoft guns gave me some good cash, with that, I've done restoration work, trades, reselling, and tutored kids

**That stuff is awesome.**

I have had a [Levenger True Writer](http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=category=8-831%7Clevel=2-3%7Cpageid=6810) for about three years now—I received it as a Christmas gift along with [a box of ink](http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=category=8-221|level=2-3|pageid=6726). This box was conspicuously missing black ink, and as such am required to take notes in black for that class.) I also use pretty cheap recycled paper in my notebooks, so [my ink bled pretty terribly](http://i.imgur.com/M13Fc.png) for such a fine-tipped pen.

I ended up buying a bottle of Noodler's X-Feather Ink, index cards. I've used it on all sorts of paper, from my cheap recycled paper to copy paper to index cards to relatively ink-resistant Moleskine paper. I have to be a little careful about smudging (particularly on the Moleskine), but it's really not that bad. It barely bleeds at all, even on the most porous paper!

It works well in my True Writer and also in my new Noodler's Flex Pen—no clogging or excessive flow.

About 3 years ago I started working as a teller in a very busy bank.  I quickly realized that writing with a pen was a crucial part of the job.  Every day I had to sign my name on hundreds of important documents, and also fill out hundreds of counter forms with huge chains of numbers, customer addresses, etc.  No matter how hard you try, doing all that with some ugly drug rep ballpoint just looks frantic and awful.

After a few months of surviving on the crappy promotional pens at work, and infinitely more legible.  And all without having to push down hard on the counter, or the little practice scribbles on the corner of the paper.  In fact, it seemed the lighter the better, which was great news for my tired achy wrist and hands.  I'm sure everybody here know that great feeling you get once you get used to it.  Instead of carving paper with a small stick, it was like I was actually writing with my mind.  The ink laid effortlessly on top of the paper with no friction, no scratching, grooves, email

Even better than the satisfying performance was the reaction I got from customers when they noticed I was using a fountain pen.  Everyone was impressed.  It made my job easier. Cranky older people who were usually stern and grumpy became wistful and sentimental, I haven't seen a real pen in decades."" Or ""That's what we learned to write with in primary school."" or ""My father had a Waterman in the 1920s,"" etc.  They instantly respected me and bonded with me for it. A few people even brought their pens in to show me or talk shop.  Younger people were blown away ""Oh wow that's, like, a REAL pen!""  ""I didn't think they still made those,"" or ""Wow you must be, like

Which brings me to my problem: Now, every pen I've had so far has been damaged/lost/stolen, except one.  And while I do treasure my 1981 Parker Arrow, it was nearly the cheapest fountain pen in my collection.  At this point I'm about to start putting them in my safe.

For reference, where you have to dip the nib into the ink and then draw the ink up through the converter using the plunger/screw mechanism.  What happens is that when I put the nib into the ink and pull up on the plunger, I seem to get a bunch of air bubbles/pockets such that it looks like the converter isn't even filling up with ink.  But, when I turn the unit nib-side up and try to push out the extra air, all that happens is that I get ink coming through the nib/feed that gets all over my hands.   So while it doesn't look like the converter drew any ink, clearly ink is being drawn.  If I tap at the converter repeatedly, I can get some ink to drop down into the converter as well

The main differences between the two pens, other than the price, are available colors (Cocoon has more options) and nib size (Cocoon comes in fine and medium, Metro only in medium).

He wore them in his shirt pocket and ruined every shirt I ever saw him wear while growing up.

I thought you might like his response:
----------------------------------------------

I had two - both Lifetime - bought the black one in 1964 and used it every day for 35 years.  I gave the green one to your mother in 1966 but she rarely used it so I used it for about 30 years

I got my first ballpoint in 1948.  They were the latest thing back then.  My grandfather gave it to me - I think he won it somehow.  They cost $25  (about $250 in today's money) and it came standing vertically stuck in a circular metal base covered with a thick cylindrical transparent top.  Allegedly

How much were the duties and such? How bad were the additional fees if any? Are the costs of shipping near equal to buying locally?

Would you trade the convenience of buying locally for the value of buying online? I really wanted to buy some more inks but I don't want to have to wait another 2 - 6 weeks for my next shipment.

1358374925.0,16pmfk,I sort of hate my Lamy Safari.,Triedd,18,7,34,"So, really hated looking at it.  So

Before returning the Anello,"" as my fingers sort of slid around on it, and I found that the cap made it top-heavy, but without it, the balance was perfect.  But the actual pen-to-paper part?  It was a dream.  I'm not even exaggerating - the nib slid over the paper with no perceptible resistance (I know some people like ""scratch,"" though) and the ink flowed beautifully.

Alright, being the workhorse missionary of the fountain world seemed like a reasonable decision.  I ordered it from [JetPens](http://www.jetpens.com/) (I recommend them, by the way), Charcoal with a medium nib.  I also ordered the [recommended converter](http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-Fountain-Pen-Z-24-Converter/pd/1941).

The Safari is a great-looking pen.  It is light, nothing about it is fussy.  I'd be proud to pocket this thing in any setting.

Oh, but it's entirely obvious.  Dip it in the ink and twist.  There are notches within the pen, and it slides in easily.

So, in terms of stroking across the paper.  It's just that the ink would skip.  On a downstroke to the left, for instance, I might get no ink.  I shook the pen, dabbed it on the paper, tapped it, turned it upside down and dragged it - most of the 'fixes' worked

So, hot (not boiling) water, etc...  Looked up all sorts of tricks, online.  Soaked it in some water and dish detergent.  Finally, I tried opening up the space in the nib with a razor blade (after watching an instructional video online).  

No matter the stroke, because it wouldn't write.  I tried to act like it's such an awesome pen and that she is doing it wrong.  She tried a bit longer and said she hated it.

Okay, because I know that 98% of the time, people love them.  This one just isn't working out for me.

The *last* thing I can think to do is buy a different brand of ink (Noodler's, though, ""Noodler,"" was ill-advised... I know, I'm a freak).  Right now, I'm using Faber-Castell, but remember that these problems existed with the Lamy ink.

If this just doesn't work out for me, in case it works.  (Oh, and I don't want to fool with returning it to JetPens.  Again, they're great, but it'd be a bit of a hassle.)

Edit:  Grammar.

Update:  Hey, just because I'd like a broad nib - the medium is good, but I think I'd like the broad.

Long time lurker of this sub, cap that holds well, and apparently the cartridge bladder holds a lot of ink.  I wrote 6 letters, some several pages long, and didn't run out of ink until the end.  So the bladder holds a lot (I think I read 5 ml).

I like fine lines and the medium nib was fine enough for me.  I went with [Parker's Quink](http://www.gouletpens.com/Parker_Quink_Permanent_Black_p/pkr3001100.htm) in permanent black. I chose this because I have bad habits that introduce water (sweat) to the pages so I needed an ink that would not run whatsoever when wet.  Did some research and settled on it. This ink does the trick

My question is, the nib is entirely submerged...is that necessary?  Because then you'd have to buy another bottle of ink when the ink level was too low?  And how often do you clean your pen?

Anyway, but everybody's got their thing and owning a fine pen is mine so I'm willing to sacrifice some things to be able to have that.


Realistically I could afford a Pelikan M200 or somewhere there about, only to find out they were giving 50% off on all models. So, I was able to get a princely platinum clad pen for a medium tier price. And I took the plunge.


ABOUT THE PEN:


First impression wasn't so much disappointment as much as it made me appreciate what amazing pens Pelikan truly are for the price. 


Weird balance at first, which I can't manage with this one (nor could anyone except Shaquille O'Neal perhaps), because the cap is too heavy and cantilevers over the palm.


The medium nib is gold and very smooth


A few days later and I've grown more accustomed to the pen and am now starting to fall for it, natural, warm and textured, it's not slick or slippery, moist, warm or cold. Just feels solid and dependable. For an object that is designed to be held, this really is the way to go. And also, as I'm a slave to appearances.

I discovered through here the Goulet Pen Company and Noodler's and ordered a Konrad and some Bernanke black ink. They just arrived but I haven't been able to fiddle with it yet.

What I really liked was the note. I had asked for a drawing but the artist was on vacation. Brian Goulet wrote a nice note and drew a snowman in 54th Massachusetts ink (lovely color and shading). 

Thanks for bringing a smile to my face with it. I also got a lollipop out of the order!

I'll try to post some photos later.

Edit 1:

One of the first things I noticed about the pen was the size and weight. My Montblanc is heavy for the size

After removing the nib and feed (easiest thing ever) I scrubbed the feed with the rough side of a sponge and some soapy water. I inserted the nib and feed back and filled the pen with ink. I think because of the way I inserted the nib/feed I made the pen way too wet. But I like it since I always wanted something like that but being lefthanded made it difficult. Having the Bernanke Black there also helped made the experience enjoyable.

I did not have any problems with the pen

One thing is that if I use too much ink

I already gave it a bit of an exercise, and the ink was nice and wet with very thrilling line variations.

I want to make the move to fountain pens because I've always hated the overly textured and ""grainy"" feel of pencils. Ticonderoga pencils are really nice, but they still have the whole dulling over time thing going on. Big fan of pens. Tried a gel pen for the first time years and years and years ago and *loved* it. The feel was perfect, and being able to glide across the paper and write smoothly / quickly is great. Nowadays though, but I think it's time for something a bit more comfortable

My budget is ~25-125$ as I'm looking for something that'll last me forever and a day going about everyday tasks but isn't *too**dreadfully expensive. As a feelance web designer I'll be using it to make precise sketches of things here and there

So far I understand that as someone with thin and spidery handwriting I should be looking for Extra Fine (Fine, but I'm not too sure of that as I can write with the cheap and twiggish ballpoint pens out there pretty comfortably.

**TL;DR**
I've been considering the following:

* [Lamy Safari](http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Extra-Fine-Nib-Charcoal-Black-Body-Black-Clip/pd/1937)
* Pilot Namiki Vanishing Point
* [Pilot Cavalier](http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Cavalier-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Black-Body/pd/1532)

Which should I go with? Any negatives? Suggestions on Ink?

On first load, because it simply wouldn't feed ink (though it worked as a dip pen out of the box...).  On a lark, I left the pen sitting overnight with the nib in a glass of water that had a few drops of dish soap in it, and the next morning it fed ink just fine.

Dislike:
-Milage varies

I read that using fountain pens might help and I am willing to try and practices on a daily basis. I looked for fountain pens on amazon and the huge variety leaves me confused. I read another thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PenmanshipPorn/comments/14vagw/i_really_want_a_fountain_pen_but_they_are_so/)  and thought the Lamy Safari may be good.

The rest of the terminology is confusing me (converters

I don't want to spend too much money for starting out, with ball point/gel pens I have been always partial to fine tips (0.3-0.5) but that's cos that is the only thickness that makes my writing looks decent. I intend to practice cursive.

What kind of a pen should I get

1347900036.0,10120p,Community consensus,Shibboleeth,11,2,15,"Hello /r/fountainpens

While I've noticed a general overall consensus on good inks, pens, and papers are a pretty personal thing. But I was curious if the community would be open to offering up their personal selections so that we can draw a consensus of what's the most common cross selection. This would allow people new to fountain pens to have a good starting point, and possibly tips on technique for writing.

What I'd recommend as a format is (this is obviously intended as an example):

|Pen(Nib Size)|Ink|Paper|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Lamy Safari(F)|Noodler's Black|Printer Paper|


For those not familiar with tables in Reddit you separate the cells with | characters. The formatting actually kicks in when you define one line with :-- (or more dashes for ease of reading) the position of the colon changes the alignment of the subtext the example would align left


\|Pen(Nib Size)|Ink|Paper|

\|:--|:--|:--|

Also is there any maintainance required for piston pens? Is refilling a pen particularly messy?
