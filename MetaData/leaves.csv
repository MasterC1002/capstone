1336231343.0,t8ef4,A letter to myself,leavesareforquitters,168,15,19,"Dear future me

so you're thinking about smoking again. Well

Remember when you wrote this? It was a friday night and you had turned down two of your friends' invitations so you could stay at home and get high. Remember how you spent the whole night smoking weed

It's called a habit. You've been doing this for five years! And yes, not because it was fun, but because you had grown accustomed to it. You weren't happy with it, but hell, you didn't know what else to do with your time anymore! You had lost interest in most other things, so you fell into lethargy, and all you did was smoke more and more until you couldn't feel your own boredom.

Now this isn't the first time you realized that smoking has a negative impact on your life. You even managed to quit for a few weeks every now and then, maybe even weeks, so why don't you reward yourself with a little high time? Come on, it's just for tonight, you got no other plans anyway! Surely won't do any damage! And *BAM*, there you go again. It's fun at first, but you start doing it again and again and suddenly you're back in old habits. Because whatever you may think right now, you'll do it again. Think about it. You've been there so many times.

You need to realize that you can't just have a good time smoking every now and then. You've been trying to do that for years

Yep, really hard. But I need you to put that thing aside. Now you probably don't know what else to do with your time. And this may be the hardest part of it. You *need* to get your ass up and do something. I don't want to throw lame phrases at you, but hell it's just so true: Call someone, go outside, just do *anything*. And I promise you will feel so much better. Tonight, *and* tomorrow. Once you overcome your lethargy and start actually doing something, you'll feel just incredible! You will be proud of yourself, haha

But seriously. Sure

Best of luck

*""You totally don't know how much fun I am having!!! Alone!!! In here!!! I'LL HAVE MY 6TH PIECE OF CAKE AND EAT IT TOO




##I've been high all over. 
* In school.  
* In college.  
* At work: Behind the counter
* As a performing comedian
* While jogging.  
* While playing soccer.   
* While fencing!  
* First dates.  
* Dinners.  
* Job interviews.  
* Church.   
* Chess tournaments.  
* Celebrating christmas with my family.  
* I was on a train that derailed once





I've had 10 years of this shenanigans. It's been good times, without succumbing to smoking it. When dry, i've spent hours debating whether i should go through the trouble of re-upping solely out of boredom. I've had doubts about whether blazing up really is needed now while biking 10 miles across town to score. I've brought that bag back, with the only thoughts in my head being ""Everyone knows i don't need this at all, it won't help me, it's not necessary"", those thoughts persisting throughout the entire ritual of grind-fold-roll-burn





I've had the opportunity to quit a million times. Seems every other time i'm loaded with weed i'll smoke it like a fiend, not to mention rejecting my massive stoner group of friends. I've realized through this where my priorities are. They go like this:


* 1- Get high
* 2- Don't die
* 3- Eat


And they really make getting up in the morning of a free day a challenge. 
What's for breakfeast? A hippie speedball and 7 hours of Tetris.
If you can still be arsed to make yourself a dinner meal you're not weirded out by











And this is the part that gets me. The stagnation, why deal with the pressure of love when i can masturbate compulsively on a schedule meticulously built around my pot intake? The problem is obviously not the fun parts, or all those times when i've coped, even when i've been so aware and awesome i felt sober (why the fuck would i spend time getting high then?), it's been all the time inbetween. The steadily increasing intake. The boredom on one side and dread of minor commitments on the other. The TL;DR take on life and all it's gloriously sedative distractions.








I've been around, and when i get there hopefully they'll be so grateful for my journey that they won't crucify me. Wish me luck.

I started smoking in my late twenties and used pretty regularly ever since. I'm in my forties now. Early on weed was great

1) Daily use was making me *tired*. I smoked a bit in the morning before work

2) Daily use made me *fat*. Not only did I stay up late

3) Daily use was making me *negative*. I got through my day knowing I could get high that night. Everything I had to deal with was always tempered with the knowledge of an easy escape that night. Nothing had to be worried about. Nothing had to be dealt with. I was just going to get high. Thinking like that, and I found my attitude towards everything became very jaded, like it all was just an inconvenience before my night started. I once heard myself complain that ""everything seems gray"" because there were no longer any peaks or valleys in life. I felt like a zombie.

4) Daily use was making me *lazy*. I stopped doing things I enjoyed and I stopped talking to nonsmoking friends. All I did was veg out and zone out every single night. When I wasn't high

5) Daily use became *less and less enjoyable*. At first getting high was great. I'd do creative things, just going through the motions.

All of this finally broke one day when it occurred to me that grass was causing me more trouble than it was worth. I told my supplier buddy I was knocking it off for a bit. He didn't understand and sometimes encouraged me to start up again

The first month really sucked with all the symptoms you'd expect. Headaches, but a desire to be more healthy. I resolved to lose weight and get some exercise, which I started doing this past July after one month of being clean. I stopped following /r/trees and started reading /r/Keto and /r/running. More importantly I took action by watching my diet and actually starting to run in the mornings. I couldn't justify a relapse if I knew I wanted to run the next morning... and *I wanted to run*.

That was in July. At this point I have lost 45lbs, I am reconnecting with friends and family and finding enjoyment in old pastimes. All of this is what keeps me clean now, as I have personal experience of one extreme vs the other. Daily use, for me, does not equal a happy life.

I'm not against smoking a joint with my buddy again somewhere down the road

I post all this here for information

Good luck

3. I'm not nearly as tired as I used to be.

5. I've become less anxious. I've always had social anxiety
6. I don't sound stupid anymore. I used to barely be able to hold a conversation
7. Focus has improved. I've always been ADD
8. Depression has lifted. I've never been a super happy person, but I can deal with my state of mind, and it gets better every day.
9. I'm much more impulsive. I was always very self conscious about being high, so whenever I smoked, I had to limit my choices to avoid being judged. Now I can just do whatever I want, whenever I want.
10. Pride. For the first time in a long time, and I'm proud to know that i have the power to stand up to anything. I'm in charge of my own life. The journey isn't over yet, but it's nice to know I'm actually on my way somewhere, as opposed to just waiting for life to show up at my door.

The biggest step? Recognizing that while weed isn't bad for you
What's the point of living to be high? Living to be half-awake? Living to maintain codependent drug ""friends""? Living to be not alive

Yeah, blazing is sooo much fun... right?

So now getting high is more normal for you than staying sober. Thinking maybe it's time to cut back? I'm only going to swear this one time.

 LISTEN THE FUCK UP.

Even if you're planning to eventually smoke once a week, throw your papers out, delete your dealer's number, and for Pete's sake throw out your pot. Seriously, if you truly understand the benefits of quitting you realize that throwing the weed away is better than smoking it at this point in your life. How much self-respect do you have if you know you want to quit but you can't do anything about it?

At this point you've done everything that you can DO to kick the habit.


Of course everyone is different but here's a general feel for what happens after you get rid of all your stuff. I'll briefly explain EVERYTHING

You feel like you can think a lot clearer after a couple of days.
A week in you'll notice your emotions becoming much more noticeable.

The emotional numbness begins to fade. You start noticing YOUR life around you. Holy crap! You have an impact on the world? 

Uh oh. You're sad now. Haven't felt this low in a while. Maybe a joint will numb you for just long enough. Yup.. that's what you needed.

You wake up and feel terrible. Actually

Turns out you don't yet have the willpower to be around smokers. So you join in. You're high. What's so bad about this stuff anyway?

A week of use goes by. And you realize again that this isn't the life you want. However many times it takes to quit

This is your sixth time trying. This time is for real. You go a month with maybe one use. Why would you even wanna smoke again?

Wow

As a sign of willpower you go a full month smoking 0 times. You're able to trust yourself again. 


Life goes on you smoke at most one time a week and sometimes not for months. Eventually you have either helped your friends quit by setting an example or you have mostly phased them out because you realize they don't do much of anything really.

You come back to /r/leaves to see how everyone else is doing. You read that thread that helped you quit in the first place and see how different your life is now. You see how much of life you have experienced since starting to quit and you think back to your ""high"" life. No regrets. You write a self post to help out others because if you can do it

A year ago to this month I was caught selling weed by the police. It was a devastating time in my life and it basically caused the breakup with a girl who meant A LOT to me. Fast forward to me on probation and ""paying"" for my actions (of a victimless crime..). I was slapped with a year and half of probation complete with monitored sobriety. This meant quitting the herb...and what a wonderful thing it was.

""What!?"" you may be saying! ""I thought you loved smoking..."" and I do! But quitting the herb has gotten me so much further in my life than I ever thought possible. While the truth is (I firmly believe) that smoking weed is relatively harmless and there are MANY functional stoners out there - quitting the herb can help many to realize our full potential. Quitting boosted my confidence to the nth degree. All of a sudden I could talk to anybody and everybody without feeling self-concious or nervous. I became a complete stud at my job and secured a supervisor position with a management position just around the corner. I met the girl of my dreams and swept her off her feet and am having the greatest sex of my life (haha yes

So basically, whatever). I don't plan on quitting forever, but once I can smoke again, it will never be the same as it was before. I love my life now and will use weed as a life-enhancer, instead of an everyday-all-the-time-life-suffactor. I hope my story can inspire a few to do the same.

But what my sobriety gave me is not just being there at the important times, and get high.

I know that I would not have been as good a decision-maker or as strong a contributor to my family in this time if part of my brain was always asking when I could return to using.

I would be left now with a terrible guilt over my actions

And most of all, planning, strength, asking for support, and humor, have seen me through this.  I had the skills not because I was born with them but because I had taught them to myself in advance.

Addicts suck at using big sweeping things like ""I'll be there for my family in the hard times"" as motivations to quit.  They are too abstract.

I still remember my first time puking from weed. That was so embarrassing. We got a good laugh out of it

In my mid-twenties I got a job making glass pipes in a glass blowing shop. The owner of the shop said I was pretty good and had a knack. They all thought I was a little weird

By far, my friend who was trying to kick heroin says: this is fucked, let's go to AA. So we did. I didn't end up staying a twelve stepper. He did. I elected instead to employ what recovering alcoholics call ""Marijuana Maintenance."" I stayed off the booze, but I became a double-time cloud blower. And for the last two years, that's what I was.

That is until 6 days ago. As I pulled the corner off of my bag to pour the last keefy mound into it's bowl, I don't remember what I did. I probably sat at my desk and stared at the curtains.

So that's it. My naive teens and my long dark twenties where well seasoned. Smoking pot got me my first friends, which got me into college, which is responsible for basically everything that came after. Now I'm all growns up, but I am lucky to have had such a rich, hilarious time. Here's to 17 more years of sharp wits and powerful lungs. Thanks for reading all.

But I had received some golden advice on this subreddit: treat the first week like the flu. Allow yourself to feel like crap. Feel comfort in knowing that life without trees is A LOT easier than quitting trees, I was already finding a new normal and enjoying it.** I felt so proud of myself. I realized that I had stopped enjoying getting high years ago, like food

In other words, it took only a week for me to see how much easier and easier it was getting to live life without trees, and actually even enjoy it. By the end of week 2, I wasn't even waking up thinking about lighting up. Trees became a bad ex-boyfriend and distant memory.

**Then I had a hiccup.** ~3 weeks in, the first couple days, I smoked once a night. I thought ""well this is already more than I had planned on, but it's SO much less than what I was doing before."" I even didn't like HOW carcinogenic it felt to inhale smoke, which is something i never felt before while smoking. I used to LOVE the smoke aesthetic. By day 4 of having the stash, I was already allowing myself to smoke during the day. By day 6, I was back to my old ways of waking and baking.

1367266980.0,1dczxm,1 year 'sober' - How I did it and what has changed.,helium-feet,74,2,18,"I'm 19 years old and turning 20 in a couple months. I started smoking weed when I was 14 and daily when I was about 17.

I can relate to so much on this subreddit. When I was a smoker I thought I would never want to stop and never be able to. I developed a form of OCD that was at its worst while I was smoking the most. I started to go to therapy for the OCD about 6 months before I quit. Weed happened to be one of my triggers. If I wanted to drop one habit I would have to drop another. That was good enough incentive for me. When my therapist suggested quitting I remember rolling my eyes. I remember how going 3 days without getting high was a huge achievement for me. I'm still shocked at how far I've come. 

I didn't think of it as quitting. I started to think of it as more of an experiment with my body and mind. Like ""What would happen or what would I be like or would I be able to?"" I also quit taking anti-depressants at the same time. But I won't get into that. 

I've slipped up numerous times. I haven't been sober for a year straight. And that's okay. It's still been a year for me. Smoking a few times a year is a huge improvement from smoking a few times a day. 

I still have the other habits I was trying to drop by quitting. I still have OCD but it isn't nearly as severe. I still binge eat once in a while but it also isn't nearly as bad. I used to rely on and need weed. I don't any more. It isn't exactly a year *sober*, and I don't resent any of the other habits I've been trying to over come. It has all made me better than I've ever been - even when relapsing.

1363135303.0,1a6nl7,I quit 4 years ago.,4years_no_trees,73,11,19,"This month marks 4 years since I quit

I remember the first time I made a conscious decision to quit for good was senior year of college and I lived with 2 other guys. One, Rick, and I were daily users, and it got that way by living with Doug. Graduation was coming up and Rick and I had a conversation about getting a job and drug tests and that it was problem a good idea if we quit. So we decided to quit. That night when Doug brought the bong to the living room table, Rick and I just looked at each other like ""seriously, we're gonna stop doing this NOW?"" We got high that night and every night after until I moved out. 

After graduation, no more weed. It just turned out that among the adult people I met, there were enough users that I couldn't just avoid it that easily. Eventually a roommate of mine called me out on saying things like ""I know I shouldn't smoke anymore, but I guess I will tonight..."" So I just stopped saying stuff like that, but still smoked. The internal conflict between wanting to quit and smoke was well-established. 

I had an incident that scared the fuck out of me and made me very paranoid for months. I got a new job maybe 2 years out of college and I went into it without even considering they might test me. I showed up to sign the contract, and they told me then about it. I ended up confessing to the HR guy that I would probably fail the test and that if that was a problem I would not accept the job. Lucky for me he was more concerned will filling the req so he somehow bought me a few months' time before I took the test and passed it. I managed to stay off it for a while after this but eventually started again... 

I didn't smoke again for about another year. I felt like it had been so long, after a year away. 

Then another work situation occurred, my ability to make money must take priority over weed. Long story short, drug tests and background checks are a reality in my career and I do not ever want to lie in a professional setting, I'm just not OK with it. Not because of moral reasons exactly, but more because of my inability to lie well and deal with guilt. And with security clearance background check interviews, when they ask you if you have smoked weed, it's ok to say you have before

Just some random thoughts on my experiences with weed:
 
* I have had 4 pot-induced panic attacks. Luckly for 2 I was just at home and ended up going to bed to chill out but they still scared the fuck out of me. 2 others were in the car

* Weed was probably a factor in one serious relationship with a good woman ending. It probably would have ended anyway

* I've stolen weed from friends.

* I've thrown weed away
getting disgusted with myself.

* Weed always triggers other moderate abuses of mine: porn and food specifically. I know everyone gets the munchies but for me it led to weight gain. 

* A small list of other dumb shit I've done stoned: locked keys in car (twice), generally act very antisocial and boring and/or weird.

* Some friendships I had before quitting with people who smoke have either disappeared or diminished. I have just had to accept this. Only one of the guys I actually miss but I still see him a few times a year. We just don't smoke every week like we used to.

* I have recurring weed nightmares

My life has gotten way better since quitting. Without that immediate escape waiting for me after work, volleyball, running, biking, etc. I feel like pot kept me too docile to care about planning and/or training for those kinds of things.

I'm a 43-year-old self-employed computer geek, nice cars, yearly family vacations, a new Macbook every two years, etc. and by every outside measure my life has been a success. And to be honest I've never really wanted to quit. I thought of pot as a solution and not a problem, and was self satisfied that I was somebody who could successfully integrate weed into my daily life. In fact, I am a shining example of the kind of person people mean when they say ""Relax

So what happened? 

I'm not really sure. 

To be honest it was my wife who basically laid down an ultimatum recently, but she is one of the lucky few who can successfully smoke a couple of times a week at most (and then only once per day).  She's the kind who could buy a quarter ounce and have it last a year. 

For me

If I have it (and I ALWAYS have it) I will smoke in the AM after kids are off to school, and this makes it very easy to be high around the clock. I don't smoke a lot and I never get ridiculously baked (especially during the day) but I do have a pretty constant light buzz all my waking hours. 

Then about 6-7 months ago I bought an MFLB (portable vaporizer) and I have to say it was the best thing EVER invented. It meant I could smoke anywhere, the car, my Mom's house, literally wherever and whenever I wanted with very few worries about smell. So it's always been bad, but in the past half year it went to another level where I am pretty much high ALL THE TIME no matter where I am or who I'm with at the moment.

On top of this (or perhaps as a result?) the wife and I have been going through some particularly rough times recently (mostly about money, but not the wife.

The straw that broke the camel's back is that I showed up at our annual tax meeting with our accountant high and glassy eyed (which she immediately noticed).  And as it turns out I made waaaaaay less money this year than I projected.  And in the cold dark light of the day after we fought, cancelled meetings, late bills, excuses, etc.

So it turns out maybe I'm not so happy after all

We're financially hurting a bit now, weed was always an acceptable self-medication and far better than Prozac or the current flavor of the month. I took a perverse sense of pride that I could live my life high, and that I was better for it and mostly happy.

But what if my wife is right? 

What if the weed is causing the depression and always has? Where might I be in business/life if I hadn't spent the past three decades in a haze? Why can't I face some of the very real pain in my life? Why can't I get a real investment plan in place for our family and college educations? Why at age 43 do I still regularly pay bills late even when the money is sitting right there in my account? Why I have not gotten an oil change for the car in over a year? Why do I spend the night playing guitar until 4AM

I guess I'm about to find out. 

It's day two

A few years back I went for 6 months just to see if I could

But here's the trouble. I may have been more energized in the mornings, lightly depressed all the time, and like I was missing out. So on the EXACT day after the 6 month mark, I eagerly met up with my connect and went immediately back to multiple times per day, every day. 

So while I know I can do this for 6 months, here is why I'm writing:

It's been 18 months since I stopped smoking, and numb. Most of you have probably used the same adjectives to describe your own smoking days, though perhaps not out loud, or to anyone but yourself.

When you're not stoned all the time, BORING it is to sit around all the time! I've started exercising more, improved my grades in school dramatically, and did some self-introspection that has really served me well. There is so much to do out there. If weed it holding you back, you need to cut it out of your life. It is difficult to fill the time at first, and I do still struggle with it sometimes, but being sober forces me to be aware of what I'm choosing to spend my time on. Do I really want to watch TV reruns for three hours, so why should you settle for sitting stoned on the couch? 


I would be lying if I said I never got cravings, but I rarely even get offered, and then it’s easy to turn down. Saying ""no"" does get easier. I used to agonize over the decision before spitting out that little word, and after that I would worry over it even more. These days, ""no"" comes automatically. It'll make you smile to realize that you're doing it without thinking, and that you don't feel like you’re missing out. 

You're not missing out! Being sober for a long time feels so much better than smoking again. I can't say for certain that I'll never light up again, but that is also a positive, isn't it?

Now, and you have earned the right to continue being sober. That's the reward—sobriety—not giving in to the addiction again. The ""break"" you get is when you see that you're having more fun than your high friends, when you realize you're not quite sure how long it’s been since you last smoked, when you feel higher and more alive sober than you ever did stoned. Hang in there, leaves. Keep fighting. I promise you it's worth it.

Right now I'm a little stoned

This morning, made some coffee, went for a run, etc. 

Around noon I went through a rationalization process that I'm all too familiar with -- one that I desperately need to exorcise from my consciousness.

All of the sudden, anyway. I do good work when I'm stoned. How many artists out there are stoned all the time? A lot. I'm just one of them. It's part of the creative process. It's practically legal here in L.A, too. Well, I'll just go buy a gram, smoke it, and tomorrow I won't smoke.

Then I go to the dispensary and before I know it I've twisted up a self blunt and I'm high as hell. I'm usually really productive for a couple hours. Then I start to get kind of sleepy. I start thinking about how I shouldn't have smoked. I could have gotten more done if I didn't. I keep smoking

Then it hits me, and I did. Just like yesterday.

I consider flushing the rest of my weed

I start hating myself for my lack of willpower. I get enough done in the day to scrape by. I go to sleep peacefully. I go to sleep as the person I am right now.

I usually buy small quantities of weed because I'm constantly convinced that it will be my last gram. And I really AM convinced. But  when I find myself sober later on... I begin to have a change of heart.

It's not even that being sober is so miserable. It's not like I fiend constantly and would suck a dick for an eighth or something like that.

1372930355.0,1hmj0u,My Personal Guide for Withdrawal Symptoms,cycle_killah,62,7,19,"Hey everyone
 
I've been through the process of withdrawing from weed countless times, much better during this time. I'm going to focus more on the physical withdrawal symptoms, which usually last on average about a week. The more you've smoked, the worse you'll feel and the longer it'll last. The longevity of the withdrawals can be minimised by following this advice.

After you start feeling better physically, and the worse you feel, the worse your appetite and ability to sleep will be. There are four main areas I’ll focus on: 
 
**MINDSET**

When I first started experiencing withdrawals, how I'm ruining my life, and just basically thinking that I'm a piece of shit.

* The most important factor and the one that will contribute most to the severity of your symptoms is your mindset. Cannabis withdrawal is psychological.
* You're mindset right now is so vulnerable and it's easy to fall into a hole.  This leads to so many other problems and is the reason for your bad symptoms
* Stop feeling sorry for yourself, irritable or depressed, force yourself to be happy. Just smile! :D and 'act' like you're feeling great and that everything will be alright. And it will, you've made a decision which is ridiculously hard for a lot of potheads. You should be looking forward to being yourself again in no time!
* It's also important to live in the present during this time
* Additionally, cry if you have to, write down how you're feeling, listen to some pump up music and go for a run. Somehow RELEASE all this emotion if you can. 
* Breathing: I've also found breathing helps, which is too high and creates perfect breeding ground for anxiety. The number you should be looking for is around 6. Try to change your breathing pattern to breath slower. Put your hand on your stomach and when you breath in, do it nice and slow, making sure that your stomach inflates (if it doesn't normally, it means you're only using the top half of your lungs). Hold it in for a full 5 seconds, and release slowly. Try the test again using this technique; you'll notice you'll feel so much more relaxed.
 
**APPETITE**

Your appetite is screwed isn't it? And when you are finally hungry

* You HAVE to eat. Without food and nutrients, fruits, or even protein shakes with decent calories. Roughly counting calories helps if you can be bothered. 
* You might feel sick/hot when you eat, Google water usage calculator. The recommended drinking amount will most likely be higher than what you're consuming. And don't drink too much either!). 
* Again, and you won’t want to eat. Try to overeat more than you normally would, and try not to think about how much your appetite sucks and how you can't eat. Be positive!
 
**SLEEP**

How annoying is it when you're trying to sleep
You're consumed by your thoughts and the fact that you can't sleep. 

* Don't nap during the day as lethargic as you are
* Don't look at any computer/phone/tablet screens half an hour before bed. Get into low lighting. I also recommend [f.lux](http://justgetflux.com/)
* Hot camomile tea (very hot
* Even with all these things I still found sleep the hardest to conquer
L-Tryptophan. More info on this: It's an essential amino acid, it will use it and won't over-create serotonin/melatonin. I know one thing for sure: it makes me sleep and feel better, but do your research. Personally, it's a life saver for me. I take 1000mg-2000mg before bed, on an empty stomach (no food for 3hrs), and also take a vitamin B supplement which helps the metabolism of amino acids. I won't go in depth but happy to expand on this. Other supplements to look up: 5HTP, Melatonin itself

**EXERCISE/ACTIVENESS**

I would sit around all day

* Force yourself to be active. Exercise
* If you really don't feel like full-on exercise

**CONCLUSION**
 
You'll soon start feeling better (as long as you don't smoke! BIG no-no). You'll get hungry again and love it. You'll eat something and it will taste amazing, but at the same time it leaves you vulnerable. Why?

1. You feel really happy. You've been off it for a while and you never knew being sober was this good! So why not feel a bit better, you'll love it. You'll start to think, ""Man, it's not THAT bad!"" or ""I'm young, everyone’s doing it, fuck it!"" or whatever excuse. Before you know it, your 'soberness' is gone and you need to earn it again by going through a rough couple of weeks

2. Somehow, you can't even remember how bad it was. You'll under exaggerate and underestimate it. But yet once you go through it, again and again (like I have), you'll never know how it actually is unless you're experiencing it. Maybe try and write down how you're feeling, write a letter to yourself, or record a video.
 
If you sort out these four things, stopped and never went through any rough patch!’. Remember; it’s psychological. 

For some reason, pretend withdrawing isn't real. Pretend weed isn't apart of your life and that you never smoked and convince yourself you feel normal while ensuring that you eat, sleep and exercise regularly. It's actually pretty simple when you think about it, just don't blow it up in your mind. The hardest part is yet to come, depending on your goals. Your mindset will change positively, and weed will be tempting even though it's caused problems for you. Here's a good goal to have: never let yourself withdraw from weed again.

1371316674.0,1geovd,I felt like such a loser,drewc34,58,3,6,"I just found this group today and would like to share a story that pushed me to quit smoking:

I lived in an apartment and smoked by myself daily for years, just going to work and spending all of my non-work time smoking alone.  One day I smelled weed in the common area and decided to investigate.  It was coming from the window of my next-door neighbors, who had just moved in the week before.

I knocked on the door and a very stoned guy answered.  He introduced himself as Brian and asked me to come in to meet his friends and his live-in girlfriend, and I learned that Brian dealt pot for a living.  Prayers answered!

For months, and knock on Brian's door.  He'd answer, invite me in, and get me stoned.  He was the only person I socialized with.  Every now and then, I'd buy some pot from him, and while I had pot in my apartment, I'd come home from work, and avoid everyone

I didn't like the realization that I was only hanging out with Brian because he always had pot.  I felt guilty and ashamed when he'd invite me to the pool or a friend's place or a local bar and I wouldn't go because I was already high by then and would rather just go home and kill time than socialize elsewhere.  However, and telling myself that someday I'd actually do something social with him.

A year after Brian and Marisa moved in, that I was looking for Brian and Marisa, and he told me that their lease was up and that they'd moved out.

I felt horribly at that moment.  In the past year, which led me to believe that he saw me, accurately, as a complete user who contributed nothing to his life.  I'd never invited him over to my apartment.  I'd never asked him to go to a bar, to get a bite to eat, to go to a concert, anything that friends do.  I leeched off of him and only sought him out when I didn't have any pot of my own.  He shared with me all the time

Seeing myself through his eyes - a friendless loser who smokes his weed and never returns the favor - really felt like a punch in the gut.  I didn't blame him at all for not telling me he was moving.  I'm only surprised that he put up with me for as long as he did.",self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1geovd/i_felt_like_such_a_loser/

   I was a daily pot smoker from ages 17-35. And like many of you I considered myself a functional addict. I held a job
  The rub however was that I was spending almost 1/2 my take home pay on weed ($800 a month). I was unable to have a sustaining love relationship. I would rush home after work to get high
  I thought pot was making it so I could deal with the world and all of life's frustrations. I thought it was keeping me from being depressed. (what I later found out was that it was at the root cause of these issues). 
  This went on for years and years. I had tried to quit on my own many times. Sometimes I made it as far as a few months and thought I had beat it. But just when I thought the war was over
 I had come to accept that this was how life was going to be and I was just going to be a stoner for life. 
  But some kind of grace I was eventually guided into checking out a Marijuana Anonymous meeting. My therapist and few girls I had been dating kept pressing me to try it. The day I walked into that meeting was the day my life changed.  
  In fact I was done a long time before that. I just didn't know how to stop the endless cycle. What happened to me in that meeting was I heard people telling stories very much like mine. I realized I was not alone and here was a support group of people that had been just like me
  I had a lot of misconceptions of what recovery was. I thought it was like a cult. I thought you needed to get into religion. I thought I would never laugh again and basically be miserable. I thought it was for only alcoholics and coke/heroin addicts.   
  But instead I found…that spirituality and religion are two entirely separate things, and not ""checked-out"" on weed. I found and married the most amazing woman. I found that I have become seriously successful at my career (both financial and career growth). It's crazy. My life is beyond anything I could have ever imagined it would be.   
For anyone just starting out, and doing the 12-steps with a sponsor makes your sobriety diesel. I got a sponsor very early on, and hit a ton of meetings in my first 3 months. It is hard to just break the ""habit"" of doing this (especially the first few weeks), and meetings give you the support to keep going. It is an investment in yourself.  
   Anyone that tries to tell you that pot is harmless, is just bullshitting you. The pot today is nothing like it was 15 years ago. The stuff is so engineered now, and can affect your nervous system harder that other synthetically manufactured drugs. 
All I can say is getting clean through a 12-step program really worked for me.",self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1blx8e/6_years_and_my_life_is_a_jillion_better/

So after quitting for almost 3 weeks, this sucks and it's why I quit in the first place."" It's only fun when its not part of your daily life. Smoking more than that, for me anyway, just isn't anything I want to do anymore. This time, I'm not going to relapse. I realize now that working so hard (seeing how long I could quit for then caving) for one good high isn't worth it. I was much happier experiencing the natural highs life has to offer. Those are the important, meaningful, fun highs we can only get from not smoking. 

Life is better and more vivid. It's like the first high after you've taken a long break (Like I was referring to earlier) only you don't need to worry about it or constantly worry when the next one will come. You feel happy and they come naturally. Now that I started smoking again, I'm living a better life. Period. It's not about seeing how long you can go without smoking. It's not about counting days sober and thinking ""will I ever be high again?"" That's a very difficult way to work through such a hard process of quitting anything. Its about me realizing how I truly want to live my life.

All we want as people is to be happy. It's about discovering how you are happiest. I'm not quitting anything for any reasons. I don't feel my health, or anything else is MAKING me quit. I feel like my own personal happiness is leading me to a sober life. If you don't have a reason to stop other than doing it for X reason, then you will always be constrained within struggle of your own brain, trying to rationalize everything.

Take some advice from me if you can. Realize quitting is what we think we need. Its not. We need to do what makes us happy. We need to do whatever it takes for our brain to be at ease and pleased with our life and current situations. For me

First

I need to post because when I read some of your struggles I’m so proud of you, but not as hard as others I’m reading about.  I’m not saying this to brag, but just to reinforce that every single person is different.

I’m 45, but I was happy with no effort A-’s and B+’s.  I was a great test taker, so my SAT’s kicked ass and I squeaked my way into U.C. Berkeley.  Same story there, joined a fraternity, smoked A LOT, got good grades, crushed the LSAT

Got married, I’m a good dad to 2 wonderful girls and a good husband, I think. 

But I always smoked pot, but it was always there.  Daily, but usually one bong hit or two a night.  Weekends I waked and baked, and smoked all day.  I’ve been doing this for the past 15 years.  

Home with the wife
Playing with our new baby?  Stoned.
Working too many hours during the dot-com boom?  Stoned the moment I come home.
Soccer coaching my kids?  Stoned.
School functions?  Stoned.
Parties with grown-ups?  Stoned.

Mostly stoned alone, and hid it like a champ.  

For the past 5 years I found myself smoking more and more.  3-4 bong hits a night.  I’d rather stay home than go to a party.  When work wasn’t going full tilt (I’m an M&amp;A lawyer, I was in control.

One week this spring I realized I smoked pot every morning before work.  I think I was a functional stoner

Started with giving it up for Lent.  That worked!  40 days off!  Easter came, and again it creeped up. 

I decided to quit once and for all as soon as the bag was done.  My very worst time was realizing I really had no more weed.  I almost panicked, found a little nugget in the bag of drawer, and lapsed (otherwise I would have been at 86 days right now).   But I’m clean since then.

Did weed ruin my life? Not at all.  Never sucked dick for weed.
Did weed limit me?  I’m sure it did. What could I have accomplished if I spent as much time doing something else
Did I smoke joints and joints a day?  No

Just quit.  I’m almost at 3 months.  I got past the headaches, and you will too. Hopefully those symptoms will be like mine and you’ll overcome them with willpower, if not you will learn a lot of tips in this subreddit.

My brain is clearer, and I’m wondering what in the hell was so attractive about dulling my senses day after day.  Almost 30 years of living in a fog, the fog is lifting and I can’t believe how great it feels.

Well, exercise, waking up early). I stopped doing all the things I had worked so hard at to try to erase the ingrained habits of 10+ years of habitual smoking. Even before I had actually relapsed, I was acting like a lazy stoner again.

Then, and I'm pretty sure she has a stash somewhere in the house(I never see, hear, smell, or know about her smoking, that's the agreement that allows her to not have to quit totally).

The lesson here is

So for those of you thinking maybe you can just smoke a joint on 4/20 and then go back to your non-smoker life

1369772410.0,1f7yty,My One Year Clean. Insight Into the Experience.,throwaway011011011,64,16,13,"This week marks my one year anniversary of being completely clean of marijuana. I hope that sharing my experience will help those looking to get clean by allowing examination of what steps I took to make my experience successful.  

**Choosing to Quit:**
I chose to quit after 7 years of total use, seeing that marijuana was not the ""golden"" drug that most people thought it was helped me critique my own addictive behavior with more rigor. Finding this sub helped me realize I was not alone in my thoughts about the damaging potential of marijuana.  

**Setting Myself Up for Success:** I had tried to quit two times prior to my current sobriety. In each instance, even once. I wrote down, with conviction, the negative feelings I experienced due to marijuana use.  

In regards to my surroundings, at least in my path to sobriety. So I distanced myself from them as much as possible during my first month of sobriety. I would spend my free time outside their influence or mentally occupied with some other activity. I was taking some demanding classes so most of the time it was spending more time in the library or in the gym. I would take my sweet time walking around to classes or even plop down in a nice park to leisurely read. I knew that if I went home with too much free time, I might be tempted to get high.

However, I have only told the closest few of them my views on the addictive problem that I had. After about a month of not smoking, all of my friends stopped offering me weed during their rotations, knowing that I would not accept. My decision even led to a few of them stopping (and reducing) smoking as well.

**The Good:** Within a week, knowing that this time was the time that I would quit and that my thoughts would not lead me astray. The mental clarity and positive mood changes continued to increase for the better part of a year. Today I figure my mental sharpness is 90% returned, but that is complete speculation. However, I know that a 2nd year of sobriety will almost certainly result in me being 100% recovered from the effects marijuana caused.  

**The Difficult:** Like I said before, there were a few potential hiccups along the way. I remember one time in particular at about 5 months clean. It was the beginning of the cold season here in CA and I was in my home. My housemate had gone home and it was just me at home for the weekend. I fired up the heater and was doing some cleaning while listening to some Bob Marley. The heater kicked in, the Wailers were wailing, and I was overcome by the feeling of sparking up a bowl and watching some TV. It was a craving but not one strong enough to really compel me to smoke. I had maybe 2 or 3 more of these feelings in the past year.  

As you all probably know, after the first week, everything returned to normal quite quickly. I really enjoy remembering my dreams now.

My biggest shortcoming was about 3 months ago when I began to increase my alcohol consumption. I began drinking on many weeknights and weekends. I quickly saw that I was beginning to replace marijuana with something much more destructive. I took the right measures and immediately decreased my alcohol consumption

**A Big Thank You:**  I want to thank this awesome community with helping me. You all kept my motivation going in tough times and I thought it was time to repay the favor with my experience.

Moreover, if someone told you ""I drink every day"" or ""YEAH MAN GET DRUNK EVERYDAY WOO"" you would think they have a problem. But replace ""drink"" and ""get drunk"" with ""smoke"" and ""get stoned"", respectively, and these are sentiments shared among a large quantity of people (see: /r/trees). 

It just seems that people try to convey that smoking weed is not a big deal to the point where it's easy to forget that it's harmful

I, but once I tried it for a while, I realized it's not all that bad. In fact, I became outraged that it was illegal. And I was adamant that it didn't affect me in the ways we all know it does (causes depression, causes grades to slip, etc.) So adamant that I took it upon myself to prove it to the world.

**1: Cutting down slowly until you stop**

First, and could still enjoy some greenery in the evening. I think this helped with willpower a lot, the first week or so I wasn't perfect about it, but by the second week I was only smoking in the evenings, and not every evening either. Going cold turkey might work well for some people, but this helped me a lot.

**2: Replace your addiction**

I've known a lot of people that have tried to quit smoking trees and started smoking cigarettes instead to fill the time, but I've never smoked cigarettes, just pipe tobacco or cigars (romeo y julietta makes some fine cigarillos too). Cigarettes are too easy to just grab and smoke. If you have something that takes 20-30 minutes to smoke, you put some thought into it before you light it up. Part of my motivation for not smoking was talking to girls, which for me anyways was next to impossible and probably hilarious to anyone watching. So as an extension of that I decided to get in shape too. Instead of smoking, I get a good buzz off of a nice jog (recently discovered /r/C25K, I'd highly recommend it so far) or using some weights/pushups/chin up bar. My belly is flatter and my body is stronger not only because I'm working out more

**3: Take a break from your stoner friends**

I'm not saying get rid of them, and mainly ones that will smoke occasionally. Simply asking them not to smoke around you could be another option, but for some people just being around them could make it more difficult (i.e. when I hang out with this person, I'm usually stoned. Now we're hanging out again, I feel like I should be smoke) Just having some time away from them could help build the willpower to stop, and get you out of the habit.

**4: Want it

You won't stop smoking unless you actually want to. If it's just something you think you should do but aren't whole hearted about it, actually want to stop. Visualize yourself in a month as the guy/girl who's clear headed and can talk to people and has a couple hundred extra bucks in their pocket. Compare that to the person you'd be otherwise sitting on the couch getting high all day and not accomplishing anything.

For the first time in a number of years, I am out of shape from such a sedentary lifestyle, but I'm finally doing something about it by getting out there and exercising regularly.

I am taking a meditation class in which I have been encouraged to sit every day, and I often find the time right before bed so it helps me be ready for sleep immediately when I lie down.

It was funny coming back, couch-locked and watching t.v. It helped me mentally because being sober around a bunch of high people, you're pretty much invisible. It's like being outside looking in - like you're floating above the clouds that they are drifting away on. You can really see how even a group of pretty good friends hanging out stoned is really just a bunch of different islands, kids living inside their own heads, lost in their own thoughts, occasionally laughing together. That's an over generalization but you get my point. 

It's been about a week now and I feel like my emotions are kind of all over the place. I've been so stoned and dulled out for so long that now my emotions are bouncing around and stuff but i'm sure that will get better the longer I stay away from it.

I know that once you do a drug it opens a door in your mind that can't be closed but I finally know that however I think or feel about the drug, and meet the same kind of people over and over again in some kind of vicious cycle. I'm ready to break out of this fog i've put myself in for the past 2 or so years (with some breaks here and there). 

In the same vain (vein?) i'd like to start working on myself outside of drugs. There are many levels of myself that I need to work out, it's never helped me in any way. There was a lot of fun in the past but my body and mind are CLEARLY past those times and weed now just makes me depressed and when I smoke I just wish I hadn't. 

While reaching sobriety I will attempt to tackle my other problems such as depression, better person. I guess one thing that has been encouraging is watching the olympics and seeing all these young, drug free people my age and younger going hard and representing their country. I mean even if your sport is too obscure for tv and you don't win a medal, just imagine being there, imagine the atmosphere, you know? Such high achievement. I want that out of myself even if I'm not the best in the world because I know that I can get over this and i'm sure you can too.

1303796980.0,gxklf,Why I quit smoking weed,Seattle_Gets_Dank,56,12,24,"I quit smoking weed because:

- It's a waste of money. I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on marijuana in the past year alone. If I could have kept that money I would have been able to get an apartment and a lot more nice stuff

- It's an anti-social drug if you smoke by yourself.

- My memory is horrible. I constantly find myself forgetting huge things and little things.

- My parents won't respect me if I continue smoking weed

- I need to get better grades.

- I see my friends smoking and doing nothing with their lives. 

- My life is too important to go through in a daze constantly. 



I'm 20 years old. I've been smoking weed everyday mostly since I've been 16. Off and on. In the past 2 years I've gone through horrible depression and I was just using weed to escape. I wasn't even getting high or enjoying it anymore. I was just doing it to not think about how messed up my life was getting. A big reason it was getting so messed up was because I was using marijuana to run away from my problems rather than confronting them head on. Last year I went to Montana State university and failed out because I was too busy smoking weed to bother with school work. I am now at a community college and I'm proud to say I'm starting to get better and better grades. I got two A's and a C+ last semester while smoking weed. This semester I hope to get three A's and I need my memory and a clear head to do so. I'm done smoking weed until I can get my life back in order. 

It's been 10 days since I've smoked and I've never felt better. The first couple of days were rough

Knowing that what you're going through is normal and apart of a process helps comfort

Denial
This is when you deny that you have a problem. You think

Anger 
This is the point of quitting where you feel animosity about quitting. This is stupid, I felt anger towards anyone who smoked. I felt like how can they do it and be fine and I can't? I was jealous and sad towards other smokers.

Bargaining
This is where you think

Depression
This is pretty self explanatory. You have so many negative feelings about yourself and life when you quit. This is TEMPORARY and passes in time guaranteed. Just think of the depression regarding quitting as a step that you will pass. 

Acceptance
Us addicts have a lot of trouble with acceptance. We like to be in control of a lot of things. This is where you need to continually say to yourself, and now I don't."" Come to terms with your previous dependency and issues. 

Remember that the grieving process is different for everyone. You may skip steps or go through them out of order. It is unique to each person and situation.

I have been smoking pot pretty much daily for the past 10 years. Throughout my school life

Why suddenly now?

After reading so many posts here

Poor social skills (I used to be way more outgoing and made friends way easier), no wit (I used to be hilarious), I look way worse than I used to (baggy, glazed over eyes), losing touch with my siblings because I don't want them to know I smoke weed (I'm always smoking weed), forgetting simple things, I get nothing done (my car/room is a total mess), no ambitions, and if I notice more

I am a long time lurker and considering all that Reddit has given me

Quick background - started smoking when I was about 15. Continued aggressively smoking up until my senior year at college. Upwards to 5 times a day in the later years. Smoked for every class, for studying, for movies, for walking. Whatever you name, I smoked for it. I was always bright and ahead of the class, always on top of my game, always had a smile on. Never a care in the world.

In my senior year of college, right? No...

I picked up the bong my first day back and immediately had a panic attack. Holy shit...what's wrong with me I thought? Lost control of my thoughts, everything. No biggie I thought. Let's go upstairs and rest it off. Next day things felt weird. Disconnected. I wasn't too sure what was happening. This went on for about a week until I thought...""can this have something to do with me not smoking?"" Keep in mind, I never once in about 6 years of heavy smoking thought about stopping. Wasn't an issue for me and I knew when the time was right I would face my demons. Well, this happened to come much sooner than I thought.

I went home and searched throughout the innernettes on ""cannabis/weed/thc withdrawal, etc. Turns out I found 1,000's of posts online citing my feelings and essentially paving a road for what was to come. This is when I knew I had to stop &amp; this shit was real. I had smoked a couple more times since I got back to school and each time getting worse and worse. This was the key to my locked door. Now was the time. I felt the angst creeping up over me like an abysmal wave wanting to trap me in its arms for eternity. I had ""the fear"" as Hunter would say.

The month following that was the worst month of my life. I lost my sense of feeling, my music &amp; my friends. Instead, I worried about death &amp; how insignificant I was. I even lost my sexuality. I lost everything that felt like anything. I was merely a shadow at this point. It was fucking hard. I read &amp; read &amp; read stories of others online to give me some shred of hope. I cried &amp; cried &amp; cried every single day over this fucking nightmare that haunted me every second. I must add though that it was around this time that I was able to open up to my GF and let her know what was happening. If I was a believer, I'd say she was an angel, but I don't, so I will say she was the best fucking friend in the world. She is credited to my entire recovery. I am so thankful to have had her during this time. I can't stress enough how much it helped to talk to someone close about this.

Once she was on board, using the sauna, taking fish oil pills &amp; St. Johns Wart. I can not attest if any of those things worked or not. I feel like it was only time, but who knows. Anyway...once I graduated college I went back home, got a job, and continued on continuing on. I was by no means myself, but I was at least able to convince others I was at this point. 

As time went on, couldn't actually feel the dilemma of the characters. This is how my 6 months - 1 year was. I was starting to get happy. Starting to smile again. Starting to lose sense of this nightmare I had created for myself. It was no longer hard or a struggle, but the scars were the only thing left that still hurt.

So now

I'm sorry for the novel, that was never an issue for me &amp; I'm sorry for those of you that have to struggle with that. I hope the individuals who are fearing for their lives because they feel they've lost themselves will find solitude &amp; comfort in my post. You are &amp; never were alone in this. There are 100's &amp; 100's of posts just like mine out there that showed me the way and helped pull me out of myself. I hope I can impact one person in the same way I was impacted by many others.

Thank you for taking the time to read this &amp; just know you're not insane. You are simply reprogramming your brain. That is all.

That's what smoking weed used to be for me. I would smoke, and subsequent psychedelic adventures have catapulted that perspective.

Not only that... Weed helped me see different sides of my own being

At least at first.

Then, because my sober perspective was so boring. I ALWAYS wanted to be overwhelmed by reality. Even now, two weeks sober, I think about smoking a blunt and how it would make me BLAST OFF into the ethos, connecting me with the universe and liberating me from the shackles of my subjective, earthly point of view. (Not to mention I'd laugh and eat Cheezits and have the time of my life)

I know I sound like a hippie dippy fuck right now, my lack of any tolerance would make me blast off into another reality. I have an adventurous spirit, and because I'm stuck here in this room because of finance and the chains of responsibility, the easiest and most convenient path to adventure is through THC.

So let me ask you this... How do I take a step back without weed? Or without any psychedelics for that matter? 

Yoga? Meditation? How do I feed this hunger for otherworldly experiences?

My gut tells me I need to travel. And I'm going to travel soon, I know that even as I sit atop some mountain in China looking down on what the world has become, I'll be thinking ""wow, this would be even more amazing if I was stoned"".

I'm 31, and night for 10 years plus. I quit December 28th 2012, and just went straight cold turkey and haven't had a hit since. The first week was a little rough; hard to sleep, appetite was off, and I had what I can only describe as momentary panic attacks throughout the day at work if I got stressed. But, after a couple weeks, I rarely thought about it, I *never* thought about it unless someone else mentioned it

For me, so I wondered if quitting for me would actually make my work life harder, or make things worse. But it hasn't. Everything has gotten better at work; more focused, not surfing the web and wasting time anymore, and getting things done far quicker than I used to since I don't doddle anymore. But for me, the reason I quit was my personal time, and how it was spent. Too much time getting high, surf the web, juggle more

I was tired of that. Now that I've been sober; I read, I go out more, and I'm doing a lot more things that I find productive in my life than just having another night/week/month/year of getting high and saying shit like ""... I'll quit NEXT month""... some people can smoke weed and be productive. I could smoke weed and establish a great career on it, but I couldn't spend my free time the way I wanted.

I actually deleted my Reddit account shortly after quitting weed. Re-signed up because I had some downtime at work recently, and a congrats to those who have already quit.

Thanks for all the motivational posts. Helped me to see my own reasons to quit and move on from weed and my own life in other ways. This is a great subreddit

1345418721.0,yht9j,6 months pot free ,tknapp16,51,8,19,"Hi everybody! This is my first post on reddit ever
    The reason I quit has to do with a promise I made to myself after a childhood friend committed suicide.  This friend had just gotten out of the navy and had moved back to live in the same city as me.  He became a heavy pot smoker just like me.  I was so into my own habit and world and numbed out from everything that I couldnt see how hard he was struggling and I left him  basically to his own devices.  Then a little over a year ago I got the call that he had shot himself.  My response was to get extremely high and numbed out whenever and as often as I could.  
    Then in February  I picked up my phone and I called my friends dad.  It was a hard phone call because I know his dad pretty well he used to take me and his son pheasant and deer hunting and he taught me so much.  We both cried and I told him how much I loved and cared for his son and how the world is worse off because he was gone.  After hanging up the phone I went straight to my grow closet and I ripped up my pot plants that were just entering flowering stage and I shoved them into a garbage sack and I quit smoking from that day on and told myself I wouldnt smoke for a year.
  And you know something this pledge and promise I made to myself is all the more important because of all the promises and pledges I broke when I was smoking really heavily.  For all the times that I was too checked out or too paranoid to ""be"" in the moment with friends or family.  Like the time that I told my now dead grandfather that I couldnt see him when he was in town because I was too ""busy."" Too busy being high.  
  Im sorry this is so long and convoluted I've never put into words what I have just written.  Im glad this resource exists and that you and I can share what to me has been an amazing journey of self discovery.

I went over to a friend of a friend's house to smoke some weed with him last weekend. I had hung out with him half a dozen times or so, saying that they were almost all as harmless as weed. We had had that conversation, and I told him that, while I was open minded with lots of things and don't care what other people do with themselves, there were just a few things that I would absolutely never do. One in particular was PCP.

I got to his house late Friday and smoked a couple joints with him. The last one he went to his room to roll up, no big deal. Right? Wrong. I drove home friday night and went to sleep, because we were having a mother's day dinner the next day. Saturday, I woke up and went downstairs, and I remember feeling a little funny. I remember having a conversation with my cousin and in the middle of our convo, I switched topics completely. I remember realizing that it was weird, and I was confused, so I kept on going. The last thing I remember before I lost it was my dad suggesting that I go to bed in a very concerned way. Apparently I kept coming back downstairs and getting stranger and stranger

After this, and having an argument about something. Then I realized that this guy looked just like me! How could that be...? Look again, and wtf, thats just me, in the mirror. ""No,"" the man says, ""Fuck you, oh yeah duh. We kept on talking. This happened several times. The only other thing I remember is tearing page after page out of some book, with pictures of them all through their happy marriage. I destroyed it.

There are many other thing's I've been told that I did

The worst part of all of this is how badly I frightened my family. I put them through something that I would never wish upon anyone. They had to watch their son/ older brother acting psychotic and completely out of his mind. There are other things about it

TL;DR: I was slipped PCP, and scared the everliving fuck out of everyone who cares about me. AMA.

**EDIT**: For those who might be interested in more details:  There are only two things I remember personally.  At one point I was talking to this guy on the other side of the mirror.  I wasn't talking to myself, then talking to the person and thinking, ""This guy looks *just like me*.  Then realizing wtf, That is me, wtf am I doing.  Then the person would literally say, each time, ""Fuck you dude, that's weird

The second thing I remember was looking through this notebook, and it was very well done, and it was one of her favorite possessions.

As for the things I don't remember:  I was digging in the toilet trying to find my dog.  I tried to cut the tattoo out of my chest with a kitchen knife because I said it ""didn't fit right"".  I tried to cut my finger off because I thought my fingernail was broken.  I took everything out of the pantry and placed them all over the house in random places.  We are still trying to find most of it.  I took off all my clothes in front of my entire family because I was ""too warm"".

Stopping isn't as easy as ""just stopping"" like most people think. I've watched too many of my friends say that they're taking a break to get their grades up or apply for jobs and fall right back into it only a few days later.
Hopefully my story can help other ents who are looking for guidance who need to stop for reasons beyond their control (i.e. jobs, etc.)

Stopping smoking pot, and for a long time the act of doing it has been more out of necessity than out of fun.   

The problem isn’t that I love pot; it’s that everything that comes with it isn’t what I want in my life anymore.  It’s contributed to a lot of the same anti-social tendencies that others here seem to have been experiencing as well.  I feel like if I never smoked again it would be all right and I wouldn’t really miss it.  It’s the tenseness that’s surfacing

Another part of why I stopped was because of money problems.  I’ve got a mortgage that I’ve been tenuously holding on to for more than a decade, and today I nearly got fired after a tense email exchange in which I was trying to find out when I would be getting paid.  If I had been smoking pot today, I probably would have let it all slide a little further as I have in the past.

I’ve been a music lover all of my life and I sometimes feel like I’m going to miss out on something great because I am not listening with the same (stoned) ears that I’ve been listening with since the 90s.

With all this said, but pot is likely off the menu.

One good thing in my life that seems to be helping is that I’ve been hitting the gym and exercising a lot

I suppose I should wrap this up for now.  If you read all this

It’s really good that this subreddit is here.

1340122321.0,va4qm,Progress report: Day 365,sooibot,44,5,7,"Let me preface this wall of text with the following; I'm writing this mostly for myself, since well

I could go into my life story here, don't worry, not because it's boring, but because it's kind of trivial now. I learnt very quickly on my path that trying to find your similarities in a story to somehow validate the message invariably dilutes it if it doesn't fit your own, so I'll keep this part short. I'm 27 years old, well educated, well cared for. I'm a know-it-all, unmotivated and introverted. 

I went through school always feeling like I'm on the outside. I never belonged is pretty cliche, because I somehow felt that the real me wasn't good enough. Eventually, I did make good friends, and they are my friends to this day. I was bullied, mostly verbally and emotionally, but I quickly learnt that I bruise too easily (on a psycological level). I developed a sharp tongue to defend myself, and also a viewpoint that most people are just fucked up.

I used quite late in my schooling, cold sweats, nightmares, irratibility. I didn't think too much of it then, I see differently now. University was a dream for me, I wanted to get away from my parents, who fought, all the time. Here, fun became the normal

Things happened. My relationships were toxic. My habit slowly grew. After my parents divorced, I did eventually pass my degree, but not my Honors. I could've done my Masters, it is within my capabilities. I lost two jobs. I have a shit-ton of debt. I was filled with regret. I fantasized about suicide. I hated myself. I needed a change.

I did the whole rehab thing. I wasn't going to fuck this up as well, and no more lying to myself. The rehab wasn't just a 28 day stint, but a primary, followed by a 3 month secondary, then 2 months in a ""transition"" house. I went to hundreds of meetings. The meetings were great, I took every opportunity to speak up. I've done going to psychologists my whole life, but group therapy helped me more than I could ever realized. There's something about realizing that you're not as fucked up as you think, that actually boosts it a lot.

I realized that drugs and booze aren't my only problems. First and foremost, without caring for myself first. I have intimacy issues. I have father issues. I have group issues. I seek out being bored, lonely, angry and shameful because I use those emotions to justify using something, anything... It invariably leads me to being bored, lonely, angry or shamed

I had to learn to love myself first. To forgive myself. To let go of my regrets, but who the fuck cares if it is? My brain was fucked up enough. My best thinking got my to the lowest point in my life, and I was incapable of getting myself out of it in the mindset I was in. I had to look at life differently, at people differently, at myself differently.

Slowly, the honeymoon phase where I was on a pink cloud. After that, I hit the wall. Is this is? Is this bland, normal, responsible way of life, life? I became depressed easily. Things would come up, my relationships, my friends

For most of the people reading this, therapy, lunch, therapy, supper, meeting, therapy. It's not for everyone. When I was done, fuck that. I had to get back into society. I had to see my friends (who all still party). I had to move on with my life. So I did. I'm not nearly independent yet

I started going out. I love dancing, try dancing... Weird as shit. But I did it, and had fun. I started to have more and more fun. Now, I can go out with friends, and when the ""party gets heavy"", I remove myself. No point staying up past 1am popping pills or smoking bongs. I can have fun without using, this

I got involved with a girl. Big fucking mistake. Since, and she was crazy as batshit (I seem to attract those... another story entirely, but big part of my White Knight issues). She fucked with my head completely, and very nearly broke me down. When they said no relationships in the first year, I scoffed, now I know. She did reveal to me that it's possible for me to chat girls up when I'm sober, and also... ahem.. carrying on.

I started to love myself. To build up my self-esteem. Previously mentioned girl even said that I'm so cool, I talk about it, I don't let it fester. A lot of this might just be termed as ""growing up"", but for me, it's a motherfucking huge deal. Does it get easier? Hell yeah it does. Do you think about smoking less? Well, it's only been a year, and 4 years ago I broke up from my first love, so I think I'll be thinking about Mary Jane for a while still.

Did I love weed? Yeah I did, I need to find everything wrong in the world, think about everything sad, lame people, fucked up shit... and use it to bring myself down. I'm so insignificant. I'm so useless. I'm so depressed. Let's just smoke!

I don't do that anymore. Why? Because it's a fucking waste of time. Time is the most precious thing to me on this earth, the way it should be lived.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,

**On deciding to quit:**

""I don't think I need to quit.  My life is great.""   That is fine.  No one here is going to try to change your mind.  We are not evangelists.  Most of us are pro-legalization.  Most of here believe weed is fine for those that can handle it.   We are a support group

However

Not everyone needs to quit, it is a good sign that you should hunker down and try again. 

If you are quitting because of legal issues, or other external factors, cold turkey is the only way to go.  

Extra credit: Without googling

**On quitting:**

The best time to quit is right now.  Not after you finished this bag, not tomorrow morning, not after I move home from the dorm, etc.  People will rationalize the flexibility of any deadline.  

Once you make the decision, your pipes, your bongs, your vapes etc.   ""But that piece cost me x dollars!""  Too bad, you already got your money's worth.  ""But I have had that dugout since junior high!""  It is not sentimental, it is a resin covered, stinky piece of a former life.  

Get used to the idea that you are now a non-smoker, and non-smokers don't have paraphernalia.  

If applicable

NOTE:  Some folks advocate for a tapering or weaning approach.  By all means, that is great.  It seems the majority of folks here cannot pull that off.  A hard stop, aka ""cold turkey"", is usually preferred here, but that is not a rule, just the group's experience.  You do whatever works for you.  If you don't succeed, try a different approach. 

**On withdrawal symptoms:**

You may or may not experience some mental and physical discomforts. They vary in intensity and duration.  21 days seems to be a common refrain around these parts

The physical issues you will likely run into are sleep disturbances, headaches, coughing, gastric issues, and dandruff. (OK, I made the last one up to see who is still reading.)

The mental issues include cravings, vivid nightmares, lethargy, and everyone's favorite, irritability.  

So many have come here swearing up and down that no one has ever become addicted to weed.  Then they go through withdrawal and change their mind.  This is not like heroin or alcohol by a long shot.  No one is saying it compares.  But there are a lot of folks who suffer through the first couple of weeks. 

I think the irritability is the most universal.  Part of it is chemically based

**On smoking buddies**

""I just divorced weed and now I am in a custody battle over my friends.""   There is no one answer for this

Your friends may be suspicious or resentful of you leaving the bud club. Many people feel better about there habit when it is validated by their friends.  Your change in direction can make them feel forced to examine where they are and cause some insecurity or frustration.  Be mindful of that and don't take any too personally if they seem aloof. 

""I told my friend(s)

""Everyone in my house smokes! It is too hard to quit.""  It does make it tougher.   But believe it or not

**On staying quit**

Failures most often occur when you depend on will power alone.  You need to plan ahead for the triggers and temptations you know you will face.  Failing once or twice can give you a vivid picture of what those are:

""I had the worst day at work.""

""My SO is being a jerk.

""I am going to a Phish concert.""

""Dan is coming back to visit this weekend

etc.  

The number one cited excuse is ""I am freaking bored!"" 

You will have a lot of free time now.  You need to plan ahead to fill it.   Best undisputed answer: Exercise.  Lots of it, yoga, hobbies, cleaning and organizing, create a list of projects you have procrastinated about in the past and start checking them off.  The list goes on.   In general, if it is productive, builds self esteem, it is a great idea. 

Things to avoid:  Cross addicting to alcohol

""I quit and now I feel worse than I did.""  If you were using weed to medicate an underlying depression, yoga, talk therapy, self-help books are all non-invasive ways to work on your mental health.  And if all else fails, start working with your doctor and try some meds.  It might take a couple of tries, and you still have to maintain the exercise, diet and sleep

""But aren't I just trading one drug for another?""   Yes, are legal, will not cause you to fail a drug test, are usually covered by insurance, and they are standardized, consistent and readily available with a prescription.  No pharmacist has ever said, ""I am still looking for some Luvox, but the quality was bunk.""  

I am not pushing pills.  But there are times where they may be required and effective. 

**On temptations:**

You will be tempted.  Weed is pervasive in our culture.   From TV shows and movies,  weed comes up a lot.  Think about what you will do if tempted.  My best advice is to think it through.  Yes, feeling that smoke hit your lungs will feel good.  Then that familiar buzz comes on.  Ahhh.  But what happens after that?  The crash, the munchies, the lethargy, the desire for more...that last one is the dangerous one.  It can pull you back into the whole cycle quicker than most people thought.   

Is one hit going to turn you back into a 7x24 stoner?  Of course not.  But maybe it goes well and you think you can now handle your habit.   So you partake again the next week.   Still no big deal and you are so confident that you think you could buy a bag and keep it around for special occasions.   After a while your idea of a special occasion changes from a One Direction concert (or whatever you young people listen to these days

It started out as a very infrequent thing. I would invite some people over every couple weeks when my parents were gone and we'd try to create new ways to smoke (making a gravity bong in my kitchen sink blew my mind at the time). Eventually

At first, I never really adapted to the college lifestyle - I had no friends and was not involved in anything on campus (or off, really) so I found myself occupying my downtime with weed. My late-night smoking turned into as-soon-as-I-got-back-from-class smoking, which I considered acceptable at the time because I was still doing well in school. By my second semester, I was high pretty much from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep, regardless of classes. Before, I could spend $20 on a gram of some dank and have it last me a week at least

Throughout the first year of college

My second year of school, my smoking habits increased as I always had someone with me that wanted to smoke. Financially it wasn't too bad, but only because I was selling pot with these guys so that we could all smoke for essentially free. The first semester went by relatively smoothly. My grades weren't great, but they were fine. I didn't go to class much, but went enough to get the gist of what was going on. Two of my roommates got arrested towards the end of that first semester of the year, so they had to quit smoking for probationary reasons. It should have convinced me to stop smoking, but they would still sit in on our sessions (albeit with their disgusting fake bake stuff) so I never really considered it. It did, get me to stop selling. But my smoking habits didn't change

Once the second semester rolled around, I managed to land myself a boyfriend who also smoked (which was amazing to me at the time), though he was going to school full-time and working full-time. Several times I lied to him that I had been going to class and consistently working, and he was too busy to notice anything different. When he was at work or school, I was at my apartment getting stoned or at my dealer's house getting stoned. When he was free, I went and got stoned with him. This is also the semester I started experimenting with other drugs (mushrooms, MDMA, I moved into a house with my boyfriend decently far away from my school. I got a job at a pet store nearby for some rent/drug money and never really made any effort to go back to school.

That summer, and getting fucked up in ways I never even dreamed of before. I was introduced to things like cocaine, ketamine, MXE, 25i-NBOMe, and lots of other research chemicals and unpleasant-sounding stuff. I became good friends with a bunch of fire-spinning hippies that traveled to burn events across the country and got sucked into the lifestyle (but more so into the rampant drug use). I picked up fire-spinning (which I still LOVE as a performing art) and gave up pretty much all of my ambition.

By this point I had seen many of my friends taken to jail for drug-related offensive. I have seen my high-volume dealer buddies get set up and sent away for years. While I did most drugs 'recreationally', and I was constantly afraid of getting caught. Instead of wanting to get high as a social thing, I now felt the inexplicable NEED to get high. I felt that if I wasn't high, I wasn't experiencing life to its fullest potential. I would even smoke several bowls right before going into work and be extremely uncomfortable, but for some reason I never felt the desire to just not get high.

Most of the people I hang out with now are work friends that like smoking and doing drugs. I have introduced a lot of my co-workers to drugs they might not have tried otherwise. Several people consider me the go-to guy for wanting to experience something like that. Drugs (and not exclusively pot

Over the past month, and go into work the next day without a steep decline in my work quality. But the co-workers I am friends with still want me to be that guy for them, and I am finding more and more that I can't. It seems lately that most of my friendships with people are based on this idea, of drugs as my identity, and I feel like I could be better than that.

For the past few days I have had the flu, but it's not the same as when I first started smoking. It's not exciting or fun, it's something I psychologically feel like I need in order to function properly. Last night I talked to my boyfriend (who I now have been living with for almost a year) about it and he was very understanding. He wants me to be happy and successful, and while he smokes, he's willing to stop as well just out of solidarity. I want to focus on my job and prove to my bosses that I can take things seriously. I want to go back to school and get a degree and actually do something with my life. And I'm not all anti-weed all of the sudden, I just have come to the realization that I am psychologically not ready for it. I think I need to get the rest of my life back on track before I start introducing pot into the mix. So maybe one day, when pot is legal and I have a stable career and the funds available (instead of blowing all my spare cash on drugs), but for now I can't handle it. And that's okay

It makes me antisocial; a hermit; socially awkward. I don't talk. When I laugh

I go around in a haze.

It's taking time away from living. I would have more confidence and desire for life.

It's taking time away from my husband. I want him to have all of me; the REAL me. It hurts him that I smoke so much. It causes him so much stress.

1339787946.0,v3viz,Day 73. My story and some thoughts.,justgrowingchesthair,44,3,33,"To start this off

I started smoking weed when I was 19. The movie Lord of War comes to mind

It started off as “just for fun”. Cannabis certainly made everything better, happy, care-free, and just plain enjoyable. I still remember the first time I ever got high. It was 2005 and the movie “Jarhead” was in theaters. My best friend at the time, Ian, came and picked me up and said he had a surprise for me that day. We went to a park in a suburb just outside of Seattle and we smoked a swisher blunt between the two of us. I remember being so stoned I couldn’t even use the water fountain correctly, shooting water all over myself instead of opening my mouth to take a drink. So it came to pass that we went to the theater and watched the movie

Right around this same time my depression really began to ramp up. Not because of smoking weed, and it would spell out how I would deal with my emotions for nearly the next decade. Anything that could numb the pain, I became attached to. 

So when I found the magical properties of weed, and allowed me to slip into a nice, hazy wonderland I was thoroughly relieved. I found something that was socially acceptable, personally acceptable, and I didn’t have to endure any pain or sadness while using it. It was literally the perfect solution to all of my problems. 

That perfect solution soon became an addiction. I went from smoking weed once a month, to everyday. I think we are all familiar with this cycle. I started it and once it was started, I certainly didn’t want to stop. For the next 7 years, I spent thousands of dollars, hours, all of my effort, and gave up a lot of my passions to simply pursue getting high. I was able to always maintain a job, and in general be a functional stoner type. I rationalized my addiction with everything there was. “It’s just a plant”, “the monkey study in the Reagan era was totally rigged”. You named it

Somewhere along the way (in one of the rarer moments where I wasn’t stoned) I was able to take tolerance breaks here and there. But I always came back. My depression lifted (for the most part) and departed my life as mysteriously as it had appeared. However

It wasn’t until this year that I finally realized the terrible way in which I was abusing marijuana. For some people, saying “this is the last time I smoke”. It wasn’t until I got a job in a country where all drugs are illegal that I had to take a serious look at my addiction and what I had become. I stepped onto the plane and consumed two weed brownies on April 03, 2012. That was the last time any THC entered my body.

When I stepped off that plane, I was up and down and for brief periods of a few days, my depression came back in full force. But I dealt with it because I had no choice. Slowly, one week became two. Two became four. And four became six. I started dreaming again. They were extremely vivid, lifelike, and lucid. All that time being high had changed my brain so that I didn’t dream. I started writing my dreams down, many of them having symbolic references. 
Then I started to think about “why”? Why did I smoke weed? Why did I want to get high all the time? What happened to all the hobbies I had when I was 19 that simply don’t exist now because of my smoking constantly? Why is my first instinct when doing something to say to myself “this would be so much better if I were fucked up?” I started to examine why I smoked to begin with. And I made the decision with my head to follow the decision of my body and not smoke weed and stay sober. And every day has gotten so much better. 

I swore off cigarettes (after smoking them for as long as I’d smoked weed) on April 14. Today marks 73 days off of weed and 62 days cigarette free. I can breathe again. I can smell and taste food again. I started running. I started reading like a fiend, actually listening to music, and started doing small graphic design projects. When I started running, it took me 1 hour, 8 minutes to run 4 miles. It now takes me 43 minutes to run that same distance and I don’t plan on stopping. My wit is back and is quicker than ever. My thoughts come to me swiftly and without hesitation. My vocabulary has expanded from just “duuuuude…..” to so much more than that. I feel like I have my life back. I’m motivated to live this life. 

I’m more motivated now than I have been in the last 7 years and it feels good. Quotes from Albert Camus like, “I realised something though, I wasn't living. I was allowing myself to slowly trudge through life, not chasing anything I wanted, just being okay with being. I was destroying myself by wasting my most precious resource; time.” Another Redditor states that they want to live in the “real world of people who choose life instead of a daily habit that clouds their perception.” 

All these words and much more have been encouraging and I want to pass on what I’ve learned to others. Weed is a drug. It will alter your mind just like any other substance. Maybe not in a markedly detrimental way like hard drugs, have fun, elevate my mood, or otherwise change me. I am becoming comfortable with who I am and who I want to be.

Keep moving forward.

One night when the girlfriend was out of town on business and I was hanging out with friends

It started sorta slow. I bought a quarter ounce (over the internet, those rules were all broken and nullified. I was consistently high all the time.

Throughout my burgeoning love affair with weed

*""It makes me more creative.""*

*""I like the way I am able to think while high.""*

*""It's not affecting my ability to function as an adult. I still have a job.""*

Then I lost my job. I was caught smoking weed at the university where I worked.

I lied to her about why I lost my job because I was utterly convinced that she would leave me if she knew why. I ended up taking a job delivering furniture because it was all I could find. I continually smoked weed while doing this job as a way to cope with the fact that I

I finally got out of that rut and was able to secure a better job but the smoking didn't stop. I was living bag-to-bag and would get extremely anxious as I ran out of weed. Being without weed was not an option.

In 2011

*""Going for a run!""*

That was what ultimately became a codified phrase meaning *""Going to smoke weed!""* I knew it and she knew it. It was an open secret. I wasn't lying because I truly did go running

What I didn't realize is that the entire time I was perma-high, stoned and running than to try to be sober at home.

A month ago I had enough of it. I got tired of smoking to feel normal. It disgusted me that I was being continually dishonest to my wife. I had the sneaking suspicion that I was acutely depressed and using weed to mask it. I decided to quit but I knew I couldn't do it alone after previous attempts ended in utter failure.

I was supposed to go out that evening and sing karaoke with some friends. I left early so I could smoke before I showed up and as I was driving I thought to myself *""I cannot do this anymore. I simply can't do it.""*

So I turned the car around and drove home. I parked the car and she heard the *BEEP!* that comes with arming the car security system and met me at the door with a confused look on her face.

With tears in my eyes and a bag of weed in my hand I said to her:

*""I need help. I can't do this by myself. Will you please flush this down the toilet?""*

I cried

I can live without weed. I can't live without my wife.

This is a lot to get off my shoulders so I'll have you know now that it'll be a long read. I'm writing this mostly for myself, I promise.

I am now 24 years old. I have a decent office job

And yet

I've been smoking weed since I was 17. It all started one summer in high school in an old drainage ditch. It was still fun and games, frozen winters and totally new social environment and became very stressed. I remember the first night I justified smoking for that reason; I was stressing over the fact that I came to a very expensive private school and wasn't making full use of it. I was throwing my dad's hard earned money away, and the guilt was ravaging me. I should have taken that anger, that energy, and turned it into something positive. Instead, I chose to smother it. 

And so it began, I'd been pretty social, going to a good amount of parties and trysting with a few ladies. Well, that never happened more than once a semester from that point forward.

For the rest of college I lived that dream. While the rest of my classmates started growing up, I totally wasted my college years. I was at a prestigious private school and all I could do was balk at the lack of ""chill"" weed smokers, and became a shut-in. I continued to smother my problems and issues in pot, right up until the day I graduated.

Somehow I still got a decent job. It's not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life but it pays pretty well and it's fairly interesting (internet marketing analytics). I came back to socal and established my life here

Things quickly went from bad to worse. I used that salary to fund a true smoking problem, and socialize with nobody for weeks at a time. I was brought on under the pretense that I was entrepreneurial, independent and opportunity seeking; when the company realized that wasn't happening, I was laid off.

Now, and as sure as can be I fell back into the old routines. 

Holy shit this is getting long

Yesterday

Now this girl isn't a straight edge by a longshot. She was a sorority girl at uc berkeley and did quite the many drugs. For the first year of me being back, eating and sleeping together. The problem is that, that didn't change. Even as she dropped hints of growing up, changing things, maybe going on a romantic trip together, I was content to just stay put like weed smokers so often are. While I bought her meals, presents, I never really went out of my way to do anything except smoke and sleep together on weekends

But yesterday, I'm no fool when it comes to relationships and I know exactly what that means. Guys, I've been slapped in the face. It was here and then I realized that unless I stop now, the problems will only get worse.

I'm tired of it all guys. I'm tired of having my mood so dependent on this external thing

I'm tired of having my potential and future screwed because I can't cope with a little stress. I'm tired of constantly being blunt and apathetic

I truly feel like I have forgotten who I am at this point. My identity and personality is so fused with being high that they are one at the same. I don't know who I am

TLDR; Been smoking for 7 years now through college, realized I need to quit to get my life back in shape.

To describe my experience a little so far ... I'd been smoking daily for over 10 years, which included sleeplessness, irritability, no appetite, trouble controlling my body temperature, and boredom. Those all passed; I started eating better and sleeping better, and finding new ways to spend my time. When I was smoking, but after I quit I did notice how much time I had put into smoking and watching television. I feel great now; definitely mentally sharper and more aware and even wittier. The hardest part for me has been learning new tools to manage stress and anxiety. I'm developing a daily meditation practice, I hope to dive into a daily exercise routine.

I am a 20 year old student who quit for new years. I got to a point in the latter part of 2012 where I smoked every day

New years eve I was smoking as usual

There have been a lot of benefits to quitting. I go to class more often. I talk to professors. I make friends from class and not from parties. I am more direct in my interactions with people about how I am feeling rather than just shrugging about everything with a default response of 'oh well.' I have clarity. I am more in control of my life. 

The negatives are that the personality flaws and problems that I covered up by smoking have come back and are not easy to deal with. I am so short-tempered I pretty much full-on yell at someone every 2 or 3 days about various things. I'm depressed. I feel alone a lot of the time. 

About 90% of my friends last year were stoners. It's been really shitty having to tell the exact story to different people and always getting the same response. ""Come on man

It's become truly grotesque to me the way that some people use weed. People just use it to numb themselves. To give themselves an excuse. ""My bad

I don't mean to make this about anyone else. This is about me. Not using drugs is a personal decision that you should make for yourself

On a positive note - many people didn't think I could make it this far. People would scoff at my calender (I mark off days I havent smoked with a highlighter) and they say - one week? Psssh. 

Well, peoples thoughts change. They really start looking at themselves because the person who they thought would never quit....did. And what they perceived as a tolerance break is now changing into a lifestyle change. Your former stoner friends who have at least a drop of introspective qualities about themselves will start to wonder why you swore off bud and haven't come back. They will try to quit too or cut back. And eventually (this is almost a guarantee) they will start coming to you and asking you how you did it. I'm pretty bitter about helping people who didn't believe in me but I always give them advice. but it gets really old talking to someone for hours just to see them running around getting stoned again the next day.

I didn't want to do the 'Day 5..6...7' day sober posts because it's hard to find a good spot to see things from when emotionally you are being tossed around in the middle of a hurricane.  Self awareness and introspection are awesome but they do need a stable point to look from. So here's my 'almost a month anniversary' post. I know, so this is probably going to be the last of my own threads. So........here it goes.

I read on TIL onetime that you forget things when you walk through doorways because your brain sees the boundary and basically cuts your line of thinking off and creates a new chapter. I'm that way now. I know what I was doing before 3 weeks to a month ago. That's easy. But there's a wall there when I try to look back at the mindset I had back then.  It's weird using 'back then' too, bit by bit, until the things that you used to love before aren't such a bit part of your life anymore. Looking in the mirror a month ago and seeing someone you never wanted to become is an eye opener.

I'm picking up the guitars that my dad gave me a couple years ago that have been collecting dust. The one's I promised to play everyday when he handed them over because they weren't cheap.  My life is full of things like this actually. Little things that used to mean a ton to me but fell away when they only thing that mattered was coming home and getting numb. Only I'm not numb anymore. Each little thing is like a present from the past me welcoming me back to the land of the living. Dance shoes? Hey I remember those! Time to turn on the stereo and try again. Finding the old Kenza Farah CD I had to special order? Awesome. I wonder what other music I've been missing out on.

I'd love everyone to do this. The worst part about cutting out a huge part of your life isn't withdrawals or panic attacks. It's boredom. It's the 'wtf and I'm supposed to do now?'. It's the part that no one ever talks about, just not smoking, is going to do more harm than good long term.

So life has been going so awesome. I'm a runner. So like a week ago I was feeling particularly awesome and decided to sprint up a really steep, injuries happen. Anybody that moves enough is going to get them eventually. My doctor gave me some Tylenol 3 with Codeine and told me to stay off my knee. I couldn't wait to get back out there training, I want to run a 5k soon and WIN.

I caught myself doubling the dose on the pills last night, and I'm not going to sacrifice the life that was waiting for me to wake up for a quick buzz. I know why my dad still goes to AA now, even after all these years. Addict is a harsh word, but it's a reminder that things can just as easily go the other way if you aren't careful.

While today is technically Day 2 of my sobriety I stopped smoking at 1pm 48 hours ago.

I feel much more energized but I also am having a great deal of problems sleeping.

My appetite has taken a hit and I have been very nauseous. 

I still want to smoke bad. I still want to get high. I know that I have to stay strong and continue my pursuit of sobriety.

Yesterday I turned down smoking bud with some friends at a BBQ but I know if I am around my dealer (who is a very close friend) or other friends I will revert back to my old habits. I have chose to ignore these people until the first few weeks of sobriety have passed.

The hardest thing is to get over the habit of doing everything HIGH. I couldn't do even the simplest activity without smoking a bowl or a fat j. From listening to music, I needed to get high. It is hard to break that habit of always needing to be high. I am very bored and have tried reading, playing video games, hanging out with my sober friends, and exercising. I know its only day 2 but I will continue to update as much as I can.

I want to thank all the people that responded to my last post with helpful advice. This Leaves community is an answer to my prayers for a community of like minded individuals who are going thru the same problems I am. Thanks for providing me with an outlet to discuss my troubles with you guys.

1310069149.0,ijcfs,"From romantic involvement to distant friendship, a metaphor of my cannabis use",,45,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ijcfs/from_romantic_involvement_to_distant_friendship_a/

I picked up smoking gradually. It was, intense closed-eye visuals, heightened sense of space and time, and sometimes incredible creativity. Each time I blazed I had a temporary reprieve from the mundane reality of my life.

Slowly I began to smoke more frequently. At first I recognized the problem with smoking more than once or twice a week: I never returned to a clear-headed state. I began living in a perpetual state of brain fog

Eventually things began to turn darker; my highs would spur thought trips, and imagination. Some were incredible and generated ideas I would not normally be capable of. Others were negative, exposing perspectives of myself and others that were uncomfortable and painful.

Smoking was now exacerbating my anxiety. While high, and performing general tasks that required social interaction.

The anxiety progressed into depression, but in hindsight it was more about trying to return to that intense, spirit-lifting first high feeling.

The days blurred into weeks and my emotional problems persisted without my attendance. I was detached, it was digging it deeper.

Quitting was easy. And it was easier the second time

Through great effort I realized it was important for me to quit. I knew it would not be enough to go cold turkey and write off my past use as a mistake. To me this felt like running away from a relationship gone sour. Surely I would run back when things got tough.

I began retracing my steps. Multiple joints per day (joint being a normalized unit of cannabis) down to one at night. Once again I began taking more frequent tolerance breaks. I threw away my smoking equipment, and some rolling papers. There were relapses where I fell into heavy use patterns again.

At first those relapses caused guilt. That guilt led to a worsening of my emotional condition, to cut down my use, and to properly deal with the feelings of guilt.

I expended a great amount of energy trying to understand the nature of my addiction. The most useful mental tool I discovered was considering my cannabis addiction like a relationship with a partner. Fun at times

In my own immature way, the comfort of that relationship drew me back. Cannabis is a forgiving mistress: she will always take you back with warm and caring arms.

For me, and not feel the current of addiction erode my emotional composure and resolve. To do this required careful analysis of my reaction to boredom and stress. 

The first step was resolving the boredom-induced drive to smoke. I found this was as simple as reminding myself every time I felt like smoking that I was reverting to my default behavior

The difficult part was resolving the stress-related cause of my cannabis use. Quitting for me has three curves

Most of the time I felt like I did not have the strength to quit. When I started viewing strength not as a binary ability but as a trend of overcoming obstacles

When I viewed quitting as a fight against my own desires, stubbornly or in an inspired fashion, through the challenges of leaving a previously wondrous relationship.

In the last bag I smoked I left some remaining to flush down the toilet. It's a symbolic act

It was nearly as painful as breaking up with a long-term partner. I knew that source of comfort was leaving my life. But I also realized after many failed attempts that I could not leave a negative emotional imprint on myself by demonizing that partner. She is still just as attractive, and lovely as ever before. I had to accept this and realize it was me that was incapable of sustaining a healthy relationship.

And I want to revisit this partner sometime in the future. I want to catch up, and reflect on old times. But I won't be handling the cheque, taking her to bed, or moving in. She will be an old friend, and nothing more.


I hope in writing this that I have provided an alternative perspective through metaphor. If you are quitting, it may be easier to make lasting changes in your life and to take the reins to your future back from cannabis.

1370441466.0,1fpzbv,Who the hell am I?,Snappo,39,5,36,"Today is the second day that I have woken up sober. I have not ingested any cannabis since early Monday morning.

I feel WEIIIIRD. Most of the day yesterday, and so I tend to take everything everyone says too seriously and I kind of act like a whipped dog for no reason, or at least that's how I feel. Yesterday, my voice sounded deeper, I felt more confident, I just kind of kicked ass at work.

Then, there was no running. I just kind of lay in bed and stared at the ceiling. I don't really know how to describe it I just feel different. I feel like I woke up in someone else's body. It scares me a little bit. I feel like there's this feeling of impending doom poking at the back of my skull. I feel like a mole who has sworn off the ground and has forced himself into sunlight.

I asked my girlfriend to call me because I figured it might cheer me up a bit. I wasn't feeling the usual deep sadness and desperation I normally feel, mild confusion and perplexity? I asked her if I seemed anywhere near as weird as I feel and she got kind of upset and said she can't remember specific details about things that happened five minutes ago let alone earlier that night. Not sure what her deal is. I told her if nothing stuck out in her mind that's probably a good thing.

1367084819.0,1d84rl,Tips to quitting,nhalwa,45,5,7,"I'm 28 yr male

1. Find things to do with your time - this doesn't mean quit and then find things to do it means just start doing stuff. One of the reasons pot was so great is it made me OK with doing nothing at all. This could be anything from reading

2. Get some exercise - we've all heard this before, weights, dance anything where your moving a lot is going to help your cravings. I personally discovered Hot Yoga which is great for mind and body.

3. Surround yourself with people who don't smoke - this is a really tough one. Usually your friend base is people who smoke but more often than that you have nothing else in common with them except smoking. It can be tough to maintain these relationships - they usually don't want to do anything other than smoke

4. Set small goals for yourself - quitting for ""ever"" can be a daunting task, and should be equivalent to the money you've saved from not smoking. (Take yourself for dinner, buy a new computer, expensive article of clothing) this will also reaffirm the money you have spent can be used on much better, more useful things.

5. Drink tons of water - the first few days after heavy smoking you will sweat, regulates your body chemistry and overall helps you with cravings and not feeling as sh*tty as you might drinking pop or other sugar laced beverages.

6. Find something you love to do - for most of use pot has been our ""thing"" we haven't had to take up any other activities because we're ok with sitting around smoking and sitting around some more. The biggest thing for me when I quit was finding something that you absolutely LOVE, were potential pot heads lazy before they smoked and the pot helped them achieve that lifestyle without guilt or did the pot turn them into amotivational monsters? In either case many of use haven't had a chance to discover those past times like our peers, the guy you went to HS with that still plays basketball twice a week, or the painter than comes home and drowns their stress in their mediums. Everyone has their ""thing"" they do, you need to find yours since its no longer pot. It can be literally ANYTHING - start small and keep trying things, try cooking, hiking, try as many of those ""Free Session"" classes as you can that most places offer, go swimming

1368196621.0,1e2jkv,Update: Day 8 of sobriety,michiganducks,37,4,3,"Hello

The last week has been... trying. I thought the first few days of not smoking would be the hardest

Once I got over that initial hurdle, I've been moving forward again. 

I started my old hobbies up again, I was a full time athlete. Weed killed that, and made me a couch potato... But no more.

I was once an active member of a community outreach program for youth, if I was smoking everyday. I went back, yesterday, and inquired about more volunteering, and I think I will be re-accepted. 

Yes, breaking it up, the hours spent just getting high and vegging out... And the bitter realization that you don't really know how to fill that time anymore. So I have begun to just commit myself to doing almost anything. 

There is a post right now about how to deal with the boredom. Well, but I just throw myself into something to curb that feeling. 

Seriously, I felt I was going to go crazy without some smoke, so I just started jumping around, getting my heart pumping, I started dancing for no reason, then I ran over to a rafter on the ceiling and started doing some pull-ups. Did it stop my craving? Not really. Did it distract me in a positive manner, and help me ""keep my cool?"" Very much so.

I'm sorry for the length of this post

In the interest of honesty and full disclosure, like scum. But I'm not a failure, I'm not scum. I'm just human, and humans make mistakes. A relapse can be a serious thing, but it's not the end of your recovery, only a snag in the long road to a healthy lifestyle. 

I'm not ashamed of my relapse anymore

Thank you, and a special shout-out to the person who PMed me, you helped me more than you might realize.

---------------------------------------------------

My road away from smoking weed goes something like this: I started when I was 15, when I started doing wholesale distribution and ""smoking for free"". There are a number of things I could point to about how in those days I started to feel like something wasn't quite right, but the easiest thing for me to say is simply that for many years I had a lingering feeling that *something wasn't quite right*, heh. Specifically, that perhaps marijuana was harming me in some way, and not just that it was making me a lazy, uninteresting fucker. Now, then I am in no place to tell you whether smoking is or is not harming you. Always go with your gut. What I will say however

I began to notice things about when I smoked while tripping on shrooms or acid. I usually wouldn't do it until I was coming down, heavier influence that was sitting on top of the ""cleaner"" effects of the shrooms. And often times it would bring this strange sense of unease or paranoia. This of course is partly just due to the drug culture and the overall sleaziness that comes from illegal activity and the kind of people you often have to deal with and be around.

The big step for me was when I started looking deeper in to the things I was experiencing while on acid. This coincided with my starting to develop my nature awareness. I started studying ethnobotany (IE medicinal plants, animal tracking, survival skills, and stuff like that. That stuff will change your life... and even if you can't directly understand why, I hope you can just take it on faith that those were big things for me in terms of figuring things out in many areas of my life.

The other big thing for me is that I've always tried to have a running critique of the logic of domination in our society (full disclosure: I am an anti-capitalist). On the one hand, music, everything. It didn't seem to make sense that this would be allowed unless maybe, just maybe, I was being tricked into harming myself. But this is beside the point, and I hope you don't linger on that particular paranoia haha.

So I was studying plants and their various medicinal uses. I had already been vegan for a few years, I can thank LSD for opening me up to that. I realized that every plant had a personality. I don't like calling it ""spirit"" but that is the word that seems to stick. It's more helpful for me to see it as like... our perception is usually rooted in the third dimension, but almost everything has a greater existence, so what we think we see and feel and know may only be a relatively insignificant cross-section of the whole (quantum physics and non-locality really is pretty awesome for helping to understand how this is true). This is what I mean when I say that something has a ""spirit"" aspect.

So in developing a relationship with wild plants and respecting them as medicine, there is a certain belief that some plants (like Yarrow) are so potent that you shouldn't even mess with them until you've reached certain benchmarks in your spiritual development, because otherwise it's highly unlikely that you would respect it like you're supposed to. 

I suddenly realized ""wait a second, I basically just take for granted and pack into a bowl like it's no big thing, even though it is arguably the most powerful of any of the plants I am working with"". This was like a huge ""holy fuck"" realization for me, and kicked me down the road towards figuring out what the hell I was doing.

A lot of my original research centered around trying to figure out what the shamanic perspective was, I hadn't found a single one that actually talked about this important drug! How could it be, that there was such a vibrant world-wide tradition in spirit and plant medicine across all native cultures, but so little information out there about Marijuana?

Eventually, but that before too long it turns on you, like you're on a magic bus ride and then suddenly the bus turns down a street you didn't want to go down and you're stuck for the ride.

Simply put: **We have no existing framework in Western society or allopathic medicine to account for a responsible and respectful relationship between humans and Marijuana; all that wisdom has been lost. Your drug dealer is NOT a reputable shaman whom you can trust with your spiritual development (or degeneration).**

http://www.marijuana-syndromes.com/ - extensive reading here about Marijuana from the perspective of ancient Chinese medicine

Glenn Morris has an interesting chapter about drugs in his ""Path Notes of an American Ninja Master"" book, it stimulates receptors in your brain that are normally only activated when you're having a new or exciting experience, which explains why someone can be ""perfectly happy"" about just sitting on the couch stoned all day. You're just fooling your brain into thinking your life is interesting!

I used r/leaves for a while at the end of summer under a different name and this subreddit definitely helped me quit. I promised myself I would come back after I successfully quit to give advice because I know that I wanted more specific advice at my time of quitting. First off I smoked for about 5 years, I had tried to quit many times before I was actually successful. I never admitted to myself but I was always afraid of not having any friends if I didn't smoke because so much of my self-identity was as a stoner. That's how I had always seen myself.
I’d first like to give some motivation by stating I truly enjoy life way more now that I don’t smoke ever day.  I was never able to keep a girl for very long as a stoner because I would often blow them off to blow trees with my friends. I now have my first serious girlfriend and I love the great connection I’ve made to another human and the sex that I get to have. (I found marijuana really brought down my sex drive). Another benefit is that I can sleep way less and function more properly throughout the day without feeling. I can also study without taking Adderall now. When I first quit over summer (no school or girlfriend) the first life benefit I found was that I actually spent my free time doing things I enjoyed. The best thing about marijuana is it makes everything fun and interesting. However one of the worst things about marijuana is that it makes doing absolutely nothing fun. I realized after I quit that I had been spends days, I was able to get out and enjoy life by doing activities with friends that I enjoyed.  
Sorry for rambling on
-I needed an excuse to tell my stoner friends once I had quit. (For me
-Sleeping will be terrible the first few weeks after you quit. Especially if youre a night smoker you will feel restless laying in bed for hours
-Some music that helped me:
macklemore-otherside
macklemore- inhale deep
macklemore-fallin
j cole- sideline story
Kendrick lamar- hiiipower
Joey bada$$- hardknock
Asher roth- G.R.I.N.D
I recommend not listening to your favorite smoking music because it will really make you want to smoke.
-Smoking cigarettes helped me when I was really craving to smoke something. I was able to later kick my cigarette habit.
-Don’t get too drunk. My greatest urge to get stoned was when I was hungover to make the pain go away 
-Might help to tell yourself you’re just quitting for three weeks.  Because after those the first three weeks you wont have the desire to smoke anymore if you’re like me. But goddamn those first three weeks are tough. Have the mentality through first three weeks that  something this tough has to make you a much stronger person (and trust me it will).

TL;DR: Quitting is tough but life greatly improved for me after I quit and it is definitely worth experiencing life sober for a few weeks if you haven’t in years.

You are about to embark on something wonderful, your happiness is all contingent on this moment and thankfully, you've made the best decision you can possibly make. The only reason you'll ever look back is nostalgia, and I promise hindsight will always be 20/20.  Remember that you're doing this for a reason, you're doing this to get your life back.  No amount of hard work will ever truly pay off as long as your smoking.   Weed will seem harmless at first, but slowly and surely it will ruin whatever you make of yourself.   Weed is not your friend, it's your enemy - it's your crutch.   No matter how much you want to believe otherwise
  
Look
  
  
Here's just a short list of why you decided to quit: 
  
* To have more energy 
* To be motivated to do things that matter to you 
* To succeed in the business world (and more generally
* To prove to yourself you're more than just potential 
* To actually be in shape 
* To be more confident in social situations
* To be satisfied with the effort you put in;  to never look back and wonder 'what if'
* To be happy
* To have self-control and a clear mind  
* To take responsibility for yourself and your actions

Remember:  If you accomplish just this one thing

  
Love who you are rather than forget why you hate yourself; its the only way to be truly happy in the long run.

1353197897.0,13dj26,A Personal Guide for Quitting Habitual Cannabis Use,,45,10,10,"I am writing this guide because there are many great and working ideas on this subreddit that I would like to compile and add to in one post.

First some background. 

I am a honors Psychology Major at my local state University in CT
I have smoked habitually for 3 years and only recently quit with much success. When I bought the Magic Flight Launch box a little over a year ago, it wasn't until relatively recently I realized that my emotions were suffering that I was not able to feel as happy as I was when I was not smoking, nor was a I feeling as many needed negative emotions that were beneficial to me. My motivation to be in shape and play paintball had crashed and my only focuses were just doing well in school and keeping my job and that was it. I found this dissatisfying and realized that I would be better off quitting. This is how I have done it and this is how I believe would be the best way to combat withdrawal and gain motivation to quit based on my knowledge of drug abuse, exercise physiology, withdrawal, the Theory of Planned Behavior and Reasoned Action. 

Why marijuana is a silent addiction

While it may be seen as a harmless drug because the negative effects on the body are very mild, given the empirical data supported by numerous journals, is harmless and poses little threat, should be worth the cost of smoking to have a good time. Unlike other drugs, the fact that marijuana has very mild physiological harm makes it more addictive because the brain weighs the cost/benefit differently. If marijuana were as destructive as cocaine or heroin, most people who smoke marijuana would realize this, and quit or simply never start, it is significant enough to cause the withdrawal.

Symptoms of Withdrawal and Combating them

Typical Prevalent Symptoms of Withdrawal that make it hard to quit include: Insomnia, you tend to crave pot because it gets you high, It doesn't just help you feel normal as many hard drug users need, it literally still gets you high; even if you have a high tolerance, you can always just smoke more and not worry about immediate consequence.

Combating the Addiction

Just a quick run down into the how and why to the methods im about to discuss.

Pretense- you have to want to quit and you have to believe that you can. If you do not believe you can quit, you wont... Simple, its a planned behavior and wanting to quit is a good method ur brain will reason for quitting (i know that doesnt make sense but your brain processes some things separately from others so wanting to quit reinforces the reasoning behind quitting)

1. Destroy or get rid of all paraphernalia - out of sight; out of mind, specific drug stores you buy your wraps from, etc. Get away from all of it.

2. In my opinion, is to exercise. Taking up an exercise regimen (particularly in the mornings) will in all likelihood disrupt the withdrawal from seeming nearly as bad. Exercising not only releases endorphins that make you feel good, but it can greatly aid in mood improvement for the long term throughout your days. It will also help you in falling asleep (as i have experienced when i had insomnia until i started p90x. Exercise increases brain activity, and in that brain activity lies your pleasure and mood systems. Most of this goes on inside your middle brain, the limbic system. Numerous academic journals have reported these claims and they have been confirmed to pretty much be incontrovertible. Adopting a good hard exercise program WILL help with a bulk of the struggles in quitting cannabis usage and WILL help re-sensitize your neuroreceptors (the ones involved with mood regulation and sleep). It also a profoundly healthy way to live your life. You might even burn off some pounds you gained from the munchies too ;)  **you will**

3. Delete your drug dealers from your phone and forget everything about them. Its a lot easier to scroll through your phone and not be reminded of pot. Make it difficult to contact them and be lazy enough to not try. I find it hard to not smoke pot when its around, I never bought any because it was the biggest step leading into my smoking.

4. Spend less time talking to the friends who smoke and more time talking to the friends that don't. Even if you dont talk about smoking with friends that smoke, your brain than remembers (even if not conciously aware of it) the things that make up that person. If you can, cut yourself off from these individuals until you feel comfortable with being able to hold off in all situations.

5. (optional and personally based)- Before I start a t break or before I tried to quit (its happened a couple times), i quit one other time, and it was for a period of months before i bought, smoked and got very very high, and then ive stayed sober since without much craving due to my exercise regimen and the other things i do instead (I do a lot of yoga).

Sleeping!!
Okay so basically, as many of you reading have noticed, pot makes you tired and helps you fall asleep when you need to. Melatonin and Adenosine are two key hormone/neurotransmitters that aid in falling asleep. When you smoke weed it increases these two greatly and because of that increase, over time one's brain adjusts sensitivity to these hormones. After a long period of time of using cannabis the neuroreceptor sites that accept these lovely sleep aids become dulled. They become dulled because they no longer need to be as sensitive to the amount of adenosine coming through the synapse so they dull to resolve homeostasis in the synapse. Fixing this takes time but it can be sped up. First of all, and I cannot emphasize this enough, hard exercise was the #1 thing that I consciously noticed helped my falling asleep and regulating my sleep patterns. Exercise works in this way because it allows for more production of neurotransmitters and increased sensitivity of those neuroreceptor sites. Guess what else raises adenosine indirectly?? Caffeine!! caffeine blocks the pathway of adenosine receptor sites and fills them in. This is why caffeine keeps you awake.  If you drink coffee, stop, start drinking more coffee so that when you quit smoking you can quit coffee at 5-6 cups of coffee a day(approx 650mg caffeine) and the caffeine withdrawal will increase the amount of adenosine that reaches your neuroreceptors in the brain, you can try them, velarian

Wrapping up: 

So instead of summarizing

Saturday night: Joe tells his friends he is quitting and he would like them to respect that by not hitting him up. Joe then proceeds to smoke 10 grams and then smashes all of his bowls and set them on fire in a reverse pentagram bonfire. Send your addiction to Hell. (dramatization) (now we're ready to quit)

Sunday Day 0: Joe starts his Exercise regimen in the morning

Sunday Day 7: Joe is only feeling moderate cravings but few withdrawal effects due to his new exercise regimen

Sunday Day 14: Joe feels somewhat better and may even feel significantly better (determined by how long usage had occured before quitting)

Sunday Day 30: One month hump has passed. Few cravings. Joe has more motivation to exercise but may feel he has his addiction under control and considers attempting to contact an old dealer to buy some just for the hell of it. Joe then realizes that's an awful decision and does yoga instead.

Sunday Day 60: By now Joe feels pretty good about himself and his new life away from pot. While occasionally having a fleeting notion of smoking and how fun it could be

1352971049.0,138e0x,"Asked my boss for a raise today, he asked me if I was high",DeaconBluez,39,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/138e0x/asked_my_boss_for_a_raise_today_he_asked_me_if_i/

So after a year of planning and growing some balls I went to my station manager today and told him I needed a raise. I gave him my list of reasons why I needed a raise. Basically my workload is higher than what I'm getting paid to do. Also the hours are weird, broken-down equipment.  He said he would work on it in the next budget but he wouldn't be able to give me a definite answer until March. So sounds hopeful, right? Wrong. He's going to give me the same 3% he gives me every year and I'll suck it up and take it like the little bitch that I am. But at least I asked for a raise and he knows how I feel now.

SO THEN after I ask for a raise he proceeds to beat around the bush for about 5 minutes, ""I've noticed you sometimes say things that don't always make sense.""  Yes boss, you are right.  Sometimes I DO say things that don't make sense. I AM distant. I am all those things you said.  But the one thing I am not is high. He says, ""Well I've noticed you seem a little foggy some days. Not every day. For instance you don't seem high right now.""  LOL. Boss, that's because I'm not high right now.  I take a medication for the bipolar called an anti-psychotic that makes me a little foggy right after taking it.  The fogginess goes away after a few hours. The dilated pupils?  I dunno. It could be a side effect. I'll look into it. Yes, boss. I understand you can take me to the drug test place and drug test me any time you want. I understand it's a liability issue. Yes sir. Thank you for your time, boss.  [end scene]

So the truth is I was high as fuck.  I've been getting high damn near every day for the past 10 years on their dime. I smoke right when i wake up, I said while I'm driving. Sometimes me and my coworkers will pile into another coworkers van and smoke a bowl or two. At other times we do it right out in the open in the parking lot. One of my coworkers is also my dealer. It's been like this for 10 years.

I know it's out of control. I can't smoke weed responsibly. I successfully quit drinking last January but I seriously have no clue how to quit smoking pot.  It's become a part of who I am. That's DeaconBluez and he smokes pot. I feel like such a bad person because of it. Like it's the one thing that's been holding me back from achieving my goals. This is going to be one of the hardest things I've ever done.  Weed makes the anxiety go away.  It's been there for me through some of the darkest times of my life and actually made those times better. I don't know how the fuck I'm going to do this.  I love weed. It makes doing graphics on shitty equipment for shitty pay that much easier. Any advice?  Should I totally quit 100% or should I just quit smoking at work and while I drive and at other inappropriate times?

Hands down the best thing to pick up if you're not already doing it, especially since (for me anyway) it's something you wouldn't be doing if you were getting high. Anything can work really. I think the best things to do are anything that lets you get into a ""flow"" state of mind, get your mind off of everything else and just focus on what you are doing. For me it mountain biking. It used to be jogging, and still is occasionally. I still hit the gym, but I did that even when I was smoking.

I find myself latching on to the 'good times' in order to keep justifying it to myself. I've gone to work high and it's been okay, but I always find a reason to make it okay to smoke sooner.

It's bullshit and I really can't afford to do it anymore. I've been through this so many times - I've gone through outpatient group therapy

Usually I wait until I have hit absolute bottom - smoking *all the time*, I've been *mostly* okay but have seen myself slipping and it scares and depresses me. Last night without thinking much about it, I got rid of my weed and broke my pipe in half. I put the halves in a jar - I intend to keep it around to try and remind myself how I felt the night I did it.

My problem in the past has always been this: I start to do okay. I am happy and confident without weed

I want to be done - I don't want to do this for the rest of my life, I need to boil it so I can keep it without being tempted by it. I want to keep gaining momentum, and I don't know how.

I grew up in a ghetto in Albuquerque NM. When I was about ten years of age my parents got into drugs and liquor pretty bad. My father started slanging weed on the side along with my older brother. Well my friend’s families were also not so well. We were kids with no hope, she got better and she was working hard as a janitor just to support me. I started off working at Wal-Mart after high school. I didn’t have a car and that was the closest job that would hire me. After a few months I bought a car and met a girl that worked at Wal-Mart that would eventually become my wife. When we 1st met she said ""you have to choose between me and the weed"". Well I choose her and with that I had to stop seeing my friends because that's all we did was smoke, and now I work up here in Honolulu Hawaii. Leaves are very bad for a young soul. If weed was use appropriately I see no harm. I would rather people smoke then drink that's for sure

1326739435.0,ojl3d,The best defense is a good offense,daveysan,35,1,6,"I have been trying to Leave for about a year now

The best defense for me against smoking is a solid offense.  By this I mean be aware of my own limitations and plan ahead.

* If you have friends who smoke all the time, I cannot go hang out with my stoner friends without bringing a sober friend along.  This helps keep me honest about the cravings, because I have a support sitting right next to me.  You could also just have a real conversation with your friends and tell them not to let you smoke, no matter what you say.

* Better yet, and ask them not to bring their bud.  Go for a walk, ride bikes, grab lunch, invite them to your house for a meal.  Do your best to entertain THEM so they dont even realize they arent high.

* Don't count the days.  This site seems obsessed with day counting, just THINKING about weed makes me want to smoke, so it is better to not think about it.  Counting days means I am focusing energy on pot that I could be putting somewhere else.  It doesnt matter what day I am on if I am not smoking anymore.  Everyday is the present, this is my new reality.  I do not need a trail from my bad habits, I need a clean break!  So dont say you are on day 3, or 7, or 35, and makes it harder to justify relapse.  I often say

* Go to bed earlier.  Wake up earlier.  It seems to help me for some reason.

* Realize you are not your mind, live the one you want!  I get the hardest cravings when I am feeling depressed.  I have largely used weed as an anti-depressant for the last 3 years, but  I am becoming convinced that pot, or any anti-depressant is a temporary fix, not a long term solution.  You can use it to get some good feelings going again in your life, and then jump from that back into a reality you want.  Long term use becomes a crutch though, and development not only slows, realize that this ally is no longer helping you!  And because you crave a healthy body and mind, you may be valid, if you are at a low enough point that you just need to stay home and let this day pass you by until the bad feelings go away

* Make some friends that don't smoke

* Identify and avoid the traps you like to put yourself in.  If you cannot hang out with your stoner friends without smoking, cut that shit up!

* Don't falter!  Taking a month off does not earn you a joint!  It earns you a more balanced and happy life.

Lets be honest, and putting in the hard work until you reach it.  Maybe it takes 6 months, maybe it takes a year, but at the end of that time, you will be a new person who is able to evaluate their drug use with a sober mind.  This is something you CANNOT do right now.  So dont worry about when you will start again.  I know you love smoking, we all do, that is why we are here, the hard work starts today.

On Saturday night I got together with 10 old college friends for a Halo 1 LAN party.  I predicted there'd be weed there and had intended not to smoke. Unfortunately I gave in when offered.

After being offered my mind instantly recalled a really euphoric instance of playing Halo when high.  I thought about how great it would be to experience that again with these good buddies.  I let in and smoked a couple times out of a pipe.  I went to bed at 3am then woke up at approximately 5am with guilt and anxiety.  I could not get back to sleep.  

Looking back at my recollection of that euphoric instance of playing Halo, fleeting- sometimes they were downright uncomfortable.  This time, even after a three month ""tolerance break"" of sorts, the high was disappointing and nothing like my presmoke moment of nostalgia expected it to be.

I am still discouraged over how powerless I can be around the stuff.  Though I am trying to remember I made it 3 months w/o and have turned down smoking in the past 3 months.  So

In a strange way, it rarely was satifactory, but each following toke held the hope of feeling good.  It was like scratching an itch, ""maybe I'll feel better if I smoke""??  Often times my tolerance was such I couldn't even get high, but if I scratched that itch there was some relief in just that.  I think why I feel a tinge of depression is in that it really doesn't make me feel good, so I don't know where to turn that will.  I need to remember I am only 3 months into seriously trying something else besides living for that next toke with the hope/illusion I will feel good. I am finally addressing it with talk therapy and a more honest and thorough reflection on my anti-depressants without the muddying factor of weed.

For me quitting takes practice.  It's been a long road and isn't over.  A feeling of powerlessness still remains and maybe is good

Any words of encouragement or insight are welcome :).  ",self,t5_2s9i3,1356995096.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/15qw4p/smoked_after_3_months_weedfree/
1353678100.0,13o05d,12 year daily smoker quit cold turkey 60 days ago with help from /leaves,luxderper,36,1,23,"Thanks to some of the posts here i found the strength to give up the green after 12 years of daily smoking. 

I would smoke between 2-5g per day and boy do i realize now just how much my life revolved around smoking weed. I always told myself it was my way of relaxing and that it was not in any way a danger to my health. I am relatively successful in my career

My wife never smoked but she always accepted it was my 'thing' (but never encouraged it either). She was also part of the reason i quit, i remember my words slurring, i remember it being some pretty good weed we smoked.... Although his look probably meant nothing, he was just giving confused looks as a child does sometimes but it one of the first realizations that  helped me see that stoned me isnt the real me. 

I started smoking in the Netherlands after a vacation with a friend there in 1999. I picked it up full time once i returned to the UK

I was a grower and a smoker

I always assumed i could just step away from smoking anytime i wanted. I didn't even put the pieces together and see that the vacations with my wife were not enjoyable for the first week was because i was withdrawing from weed. I used to think i could quit anytime i wanted. 

I thought weed helped me get over my brothers death

The first week was hard. No sleep, sweating, cravings, cravings, cravings...... 

The second week it got better

After a month i was just down to sleep problems and the odd craving

2 months later i still dont sleep properly but its much better. I am actually ok on 5 hours sleep. Much better than i was after 10 hours sleep if i had a smoke the night before. Strange but true. I still get cravings but my mind switches off from them much better

If i can help in anyway let me know. Here are my 'pro tips'

- If you dont exercise

- If you are like me

- in the first 3 weeks you will find that you have an overwhelming desire to self improve. During this time it is critical you follow up on these thoughts. You need to prove to your new self that he is better than the old self. The old self had thoughts of doing his Masters or taking a new job or helping out at the local charity event but he never followed it up. The new self has much more motivation

- Try not to drink to much. If you need to replace your addiction

- Find a support network if you can

- If your friends cant respect that you want to stop then they are not friends. One or two of my friends laughed at me

- if you are finding it hard to deal with issues that resurface from your past take assurance in the fact that time will heal them and at some point you need to address them so why not start now. Many of these problems are old and from years ago so they only hurt in your mind now

Finally, yes it seems crazy but it helped me. It does gets easier. Eventually.

Best of luck to you all and thanks again to all the weed vets that shared their stories on quitting.

1343063765.0,x0vyf,DAE Get TOO stoned and want to quit smoking every time..Only to want to smoke again when sober? ,candilora28,40,11,18,"I smoke weed everyday

I am 21 years old and would consider myself a functional smoker. I go to college and work and am successful while still blazing weed. However I have learned quickly never to smoke before going to work or college.. The key is to smoke after your responsibilities are done for the day.

I have always had access to very very high quality marijuana

I have learned there are different highs and levels of being stoned. Some nights I smoke and must not take as deep of a hit or as much

Then there are those times where I take a big rip, not even so much that I think they will know I am high.

Powerful eye drops help me feel better with this.. But if I happen to smoke on a whim somewhere that I don't have eyedrops.. Man I end up regretting it.

Along with my eyes feeling weird I also say weird stuff and smoking before a business meeting would be very stressful and awkward for me if I happened to be ""too stoned"". I would feel self conscious about what I am saying and if I am sounding correct.

I also get paranoid when I am this stoned, trippin on a bug bite or some other health issue.

All of this combined makes for some unpleasant times when stoned.. and I find myself saying in my head ""You are an idiot! Why did you smoke

However whenever I become back to normal or come down I find myself wanting to smoke.. Despite how I felt before

it's a viscous cycle.

Now some history.. I am very pro marijuana. I don't consider it a drug or a harmful substance that should be banned or compared to alcohol. A lot of people in my family are functional smoking members of society and I was raised to know that.

However I think it is something that can be abused and shouldn't be used everyday as a crutch. I think it is something best used moderately.

There is a flip side to this.. Tolerance.. As all of you may know if you smoke regularly you develop a tolerance and you can handle getting stoned without being ""too stoned"" (Even though I smoke everyday and I still get ""too stoned"" often). So if one uses it moderately it seems that every time you use it you will get way way too stoned.

Seems the best option would be to stop all together.. But it's hard.. Seems like it's a complex relationship with marijuana. I know people claim there isn't an addiction with marijuana.. But I think there is a psychological addiction to it maybe not a physical one. I think that you become addicted to the act of it. Grinding the weed, enjoying the conversations you have while becoming altered.. Making an event out of it. Also it makes activities more fun, you find it fun to smoke a bowl before bowling, before watching a movie, before playing a video game etc.. etc.. Then when you go to do these activities it becomes second nature to reach for the bowl first.


Anyways I just wanted to kind of tell my perception of it and see who else could relate. I would like to stop smoking and depending on it but it seems it always is there and always so easy to come back to.

I just wanted to give up little update.  I'm on my 23rd week of no weed what so ever.  I've been a 10+ year smoker

It was insanely hard, just know that it is very possible to achieve and stick to.

The first 3-4 weeks were really hard for me because of all the withdrawal symptoms.  I decided to do it cold turkey because I know my personality

The symptoms included night sweats, I would have lucid dreams.  Also the my anxiety went through the roof.  I would have moments of self doubt, anxiousness and paranoia.  But i knew that will pass because of this awesome subreddit.  Reading about what other people were going through and the support that they got was such a tremendous help to me.  

But after some time

Most importantly

So, so work hard, keep focus and be patient.  Take one step at a time!  I also want to thank this small little community for their constant support and guidance.

1367149742.0,1d9noe,16 days...why I quit and some other thoughts,JimNCrik,34,2,1,"I'm 31, the easier it is to remember how much I love it and the more difficult it is to remember why I'm giving up. I'm writing this to help me remember for future cravings and maybe it will also help some of you. So here are the main reasons I'm quitting.

1. I love being smart and being able to engage more meaningfully with people at work and socially. I hate worrying that I'm not performing at my best

2. I love the initial high

3. I hate how unhealthy I am when I smoke. I eat absurd amounts of food

4. I'm damaging my relationship. My fiance who was always fine with my smoking has recently (with my increasing use) realised that I have a problem and thinks I need to quit. I've also managed to intertwine my weed addiction with a porn and fap addiction which ends up replacing actual intimacy with her.

5. I procrastinate and end up not doing properly (or not doing at all) tasks that I know would be constructive and improve my career or me as a person.

6. I take unnecessary risks. Example: the last time I brought weed I was literally parked next to a cop car

Those are the main ones I can think of right now. From experience I know that strong cravings can come even a year down the line, just one or two tokes won't kill me, and it will be so nice. But I hope I can remember that I've been there before and have proven time and time again that it's never just one or two tokes- its the beginning of a binge, and while it may not kill me (not short term anyway), it can only make my life worse. After the initial high I'll just feel shit, and I WILL end up regretting it.

tl;dr the longer I stay clean the more I tend to forget why I quit and relapse becomes more likely- these are the six main reasons I am quitting.

I've been a daily pot smoker for the past 5 years. During the first two years of daily smoking, life was generally pleasurable. Little did I know that that pleasure I derived from my life, came mostly from an artificial source (not from within me, but from dried plant matter).

The last three years, and I've seen my GPA take a massive hit. It took me a while to come to this conclusion, but it's not necessarily one problem (me) or the other (pot). It's both. There are some people with such addictive tendencies (ie, myself, and let's be honest - if you're on /r/leaves, you have that addictive tendency as well), that it overpowers their will to.. do

Like the title states

Not only did my GPA take a hit, smoke pot, and play video games. All for what? Nothing that's going to benefit me. I lost my girlfriend, though it was a rocky relationship, it lasted 6 years. I think the final straw was my absolute decline in attitude. I was not a pleasant person to be around, I was child-like, I nagged when something didn't go my way

Fast forward a little. About two weeks ago, but this one - she was my first boa, she got me into the herpetology world. Upon further investigation, I found out that she regurgitated her last two meals (I keep them on a steady and slow feeding schedule) and she had essentially starved to death. If I had been paying better attention to animals that I've put into my care, she'd probably still be alive.

I thought that would be the end of it (I'm a bong smoker, within 2 hours, I went to the store, bought some paper, and finished my stash. Told myself it would be the last. The next day, I found myself at my dealers doorstep, without even thinking. I grabbed again, sometimes up to 5 grams. I would roll 3 massive joints

I neglected everything, my school, my grades, my family. All in the name of getting high. Fuck it. Fuck it all to hell. I'm so ashamed of what I've done to myself, I know I'm a bright individual capable of achieving good (maybe even great) things, but I threw it all away. There's no way I can salvage my GAP and get into Grad school like I had originally planned, there's not enough time left in my Uni career.

**This past Friday, and watched all thirteen episodes of House of Cards on Netflix. There was one specific episode - I think maybe the third or the fourth, when they're sitting at an AA meeting, and one guy there said, and I quote (well, paraphrase actually, since I don't remember it in its entirety):**

**""Every day I don't drink, the scarier it gets. Cause I know, all it takes is one drink to go back down to zero...
I can't control my fear of it
**At this moment

**I flushed my stash (~2 grams that were left)

This is my third day of not smoking, and I don't know how to reward myself (since I used pot as a reward, always) when I've accomplished something. But if there's anything that's stuck with my these past three days, it's the quote from House of Cards: ""I can control the zero. FUCK the zero"". Just thinking about it gets me teary for some reason. It's so easily applicable to marijuana. All it takes is one drag, and I'm back down to zero, and these past three days of seeming HELL would have been for nothing. I will NOT let this happen.

I want to move on with my life, skip class, assignments and midterms, then drop all their courses mid way through the semester (this happened to me last semester).

It's hard being in my head, and weed really helped counter-balance that. I'm a deep thinker, and I tend to over analyze everything, panic attacks are no stranger to me, and I've had a few in the past few days. I've been smoking a lot of cigarettes unfortunately, but that's next on my list of bad habbits to kick.

I want to get better guys, I want to live, I want to finish school, I want to get married and have kids and watch them grow up. 
I DO NOT WANT TO RELY ON SOMETHING SO HEAVILY. SOmething that shuts me down for the day

What's helping me counter-balance it now

I smoked daily for years. Woke up, and being able to graduate *cum laude* in a challenging music-related program while high every day.

Besides being obviously fully functional (in my eyes, that would come much much later. No, at the time I just thought there was something wrong with me, and the only way I had been taught to deal with something wrong was to be angry at it and then ignore it as best I could. Trees were how I manged to ignore it for my entire college education.

A year after graduating, and spiritually. That meant of course, cleaning up my act. I decided that it was time for me to stop smoking. 6 months later and about 3 of those days successfully tree-free, I realized I *might* have a problem. 6 more months were spent trying to drag my ass to some type of meeting, but each time I almost went, I just couldn't do it. They were the worst 6 months. I canceled performances because the trees weren't helping my anxiety anymore, and I would stay at home smoking and crying and hating myself and smoking more so I wouldn't think about it. I couldn't really afford the amount I was smoking daily, hoping he wouldn't notice.

At the end of those six months, but I obviously needed structure and accountability. I'm half Jewish and half this and half that, have lived in several different cultures so it's pretty easy for me to see the universal truths in things - and there were a lot of pros to going to meetings. Little known fact; a lot of original AA'ers did hallucinogens/entheogens and many are Buddhist. Higher Power is a power greater than yourself and does not have anything to do with some sort of God unless that's what you want it to be.

I was so quiet the first month. I never spoke up, and everyone else is pretty much faking it. For some reason, I finally got a sponsor, who I can honestly say saved my life. They didn't turn me away no matter what I admitted to. One of my favorite speakers at the meetings I went to was a guy named Jim, a real old-timer. One of those guys who'd been around so long he entered AA when only the truly fucked up, end of the line people were admitted. He had crazy stories about his mother sexually assaulting him, and blackouts that lasted for days. He always said each time, and proudly declared, and then died. So now I'd made a promise to a dead man that I'd never relapse. Great.

Those next few months were rough. Being sober was difficult enough as it is. Friends were disappearing (it wasn't such much fun having a friend who claimed addiction to trees), ever, and my sponsor was making me work the steps hard. Described by one of their very colorful analogies, to unclog my fucked up plumbing, I had to let everything come to the surface before it got drained. And that's pretty much what happened.

After about a year, and haven't had a problem. Naturally this made AA a difficult place for help. At the same time, I'd been traveling with some very dogmatic AA'ers, which really twisted the program for me. I ended up leaving it, fairly remorseful, but I feel that my non-abstinent protocol could be harmful for addicts who need abstinent role models. Just my opinion.

I still gained many things from AA. Their many sayings are cheesy, especially for anyone who is more relapse-prone, but so far it has worked for me. It's tough, but going to meetings, saying my clean date and proclaiming I'm an addict reminds that I do have to do work if I want to stay clean and not just drug-free (white knuckling as they call it....a dry alcoholic is not really any better than a drinking alcoholic without changing the way they deal with life). Hearing stories helps. Hearing people in early sobriety share things they'd never shared before, and being that accepting witness for them, also helps a lot. We all do fucked up things

In the end, and lots of them. AA gave me a new toolkit for dealing with life's unwanted challenges, and I'll always be grateful for that. I'm grateful that I'm not only tree-free, but I'm also a better and more caring partner, friend, relative and general member of society. I don't need a drug to feel relaxed or productive. I can do it on my own now.

My daily consumption averaged 3-4 joints a day in high (indeed!) school

2 months ago I woke up one morning feeling literally like CRAP. This was very unusual. It forced me to have an honest assessment not only of what weed was doing to me

The day after, I decided to call it quits.

My problem was, lucid attention. Or more than one. I needed a REAL challenge. An ambitious, total lifestyle change.

This is a list describing what I've done to turn my life around. I hope it helps you. I sure did help me

- Quit weed
- Cut off losers from your life, negative, angry people, lazy people. They will try to bring you down and make you feel bad for doing what they don't have the guts of doing.
- Eat healthy (no junk food
- Work out HARD (crossfit
- Take up Jiu Jitsu/ MMA
- unsubscribe from r/politics and generally every whinging subreddit whose content comes from depressed weird kids in their 20s that sit on their ass all day
- Quit videogames, movies, commercial tv...and reddit (or at least subscribe to things that improve your life ONLY). Replace them with things life this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasIq4E9nNg
- Spend time outdoors (beach

and now the most important ones.

- SOCIALIZE
 
- Get into PUA (pick-up artistry). I was very skeptic initially, fully independent and fully confident man. You have to sort your shit out in order to sleep with really hot women, period.

Furthermore

I now realize weed was giving me a crippling social anxiety that cost me many lays I could have gotten if I just had the courage to approach more women and had the simple ability of not giving a fuck

I suspect it also cost me friendships and social life in general. Youtube and videogames are so appetizing when you're baked as fuck, my experience taught me that if you abuse it, it becomes a poison that condems you to mediocrity. And no-one will come to rescue you.

Whatever you do, it simply has become indifferent to me.)

I just wanted to encourage everyone saying that the first 3 weeks are definitely the hardest and now its pretty easy not to smoke. I've dealt with loneliness, nightmares, and fear head on and I'm alive and sober to tell the tale. 

Once I was able to deal with these issues in a way that wasn't getting high

Some tips that have really helped me:

- r/leaves ! dunno i could have made it this far without this community

- drink tea with half a lemon! i know this sounds silly to a stoner because there's no high

- work out. The times I've felt the worst

- treat it like a breakup and keep yourself busy. Make the breakup FINAL. none of this ""we were on a break"" crap. If you have plans to get back together then you'll never move on. 

- Find an accountabilibuddy. My boyfriend in Ohio quit at the same time as me

- Tell a lot of your friends that you're quitting and tell them the extent of the problem you had. i even posted to facebook saying I love r/leaves and am not going back. Believe me

- Make friends who don't smoke. In college

Best of luck everyone! If you're here then you're on the right track.

It's easy now. Much easier. Make it through the first 3 weeks with the willpower that got you that far, it'll stay that way.

Since marijuana takes quite a while to detox from, they came in a flood. I cried, a lot. I was grieving the loss of a friend, a friend who had been there for me whenever I was sad, bored or angry. A friend who I thought would always be there for me. 

Every day I sat in groups where people described events where their powerlessness over their substance lead to damages. At first I had nothing of real value to share, who always had access to funds, and since being a stoner is rather cheap, I never did anything horrible to get my drugs. I realised something though, I wasn't living. I was allowing myself to slowly trudge through life, not chasing anything I wanted, just being okay with being. I was destroying myself by wasting my most precious resource

I went to a secondary facility after the first 24 days, and it involved a lot of work, but I did it with pleasure. For the first time in my life I understood why I did the things I did, what my limitations are, and how to overcome adversity.

I discovered that I'm a one man pity-party. That I'm addicted to anything from gaming to relationships. That I don't stand up for myself

To me marijuana became Mary Jane the crazy girlfriend. She loved me very much, because she was jealous. She demanded constant attention, because she was needy. We had massive fights, but I always forgave her. She always supported me through my problems, but never gave me a tangible solution, because she needed me to need her. 

A lot has changed in 8 months, oh sweet sweet subconscious trickery! I'm not a cynic, because I don't need to justify how shitty the world is to rationalise smoking.

2.  Better in control of my diet; I was a health and fitness nut during my stoner days
3.  The natural ""highs"" of life feel much better than any high that weed ever brought - movies are funnier
4.  Money saved.  My habit cost me ~$60 a week to sustain; now I have extra cash to spend on foods I like
5.  Increased social contact with friends and family.  When I was high, and texts would pile up in their respective inboxes, often becoming a chore to respond to.  Now, I am actively seeking out the people I care about in my life.
6.  My values and morals are clearer to me and I feel more confident speaking up for them and acting on them.  I don't feel as pressured to be somebody else.
7.  My eye contact is much better!

I couldn't get over the idea that being high enhance my experience of things. Even though in reality every time i got high it was making me feel paranoid and antisocial.

Until a few months ago, stole from my parents to buy weed, smoked weed and cigarettes all day erryday, and pretty much hated myself because I was unable to quit. I'd even started doing other drugs (Shrooms, LSD) because I could barely get high from weed anymore because I smoked so much.

The coffee made me feel fucking great. And the song made me feel even better. And here's what I realized: *Coffee makes me feel better than weed does.* I smoked another few joints and cigarettes and felt terrible, watched Inglorious Basterds, and have been drug-free and sober (except coffee, which is definitely a drug) for four months.

Instead of obsessing about weed and building my day around my trips to the drug dealer and my smoke breaks, clean my room, work out, and feel great. Weed and cigarettes made me feel terrible and fucking lethargic. Coffee makes me feel quite good. They're both drugs, and I can obsess about the rituals attached to consuming either one, but one makes me feel good and the others make me feel bad.

1347540611.0,zticd,Nearly Took that 1 Toke in. So happy i didn't.,tokedguy1,34,5,6,"I lived my teenage life without any motivation left to do anything

On my 20th birthday back in October, it had probably 4-7 grams of super lemon haze in it too, my favorite smoke... i thanked my friends, showed my appreciation but let them smoke it, they looked at me in shock and confusion, after a while i was convinced to take just 1 toke...


Before that 1 toke, before when i smoked weed i was trying to speak and i couldn't really speak without hesitation and anxiety anymore and i had little self esteem left for many reasons but mainly because of smoking weed daily and not socializing with society.

After that 1 long pull from that blunt, i literally pictured the words scramble as i was trying to say them, it was very upsetting for me because i didn't want to live a life without a clear mind anymore, i missed that clear sense of well being and that was my high...

After that i actually started to zone out and stopped speaking, ufcourse i didn't need to all i needed was to ride it and let go but my mind wen't on full defense mode.

Anyway since then i stopped smoking for a couple of months, i was able to sleep without insomnia  (i normally smoked at night to help me sleep but turns out i had a bad sleep cycle because of thaqt as i ended up waking up in the afternoon), I stopped wheezing and coughing, i was more relaxed, calm and more on point with everything, my job became easier and i had more patience when doing everyday tasks. First 2 weeks was soo hard, i couldn't stop thinking, stressing

Shit i think i went skits for a bit, i couldn't breath properly i started panicking, i forgot why i stoped smoking in the first place and my mind was set on building my tollerence and controlling myself... This led me to smoking for a couple of more months...

2 weeks ago i wen't on a vacation with my uncle, he noticed oddness in my behaviour, and talked to me, asked me if i smoke weed and i told him i do, he told me why he quit and what hes been through and i managed to remember why i quit last year. Since then i haven't smoked anything.

Anyway Yesterday i met my friend he rolled a nice spiff and lit it up, i looked at it and returned it.

He looked at me suprised said oh shit... and asked me why i didn't smoke it

I pointed out to him how he was acting once he lost his stash that day, he has 2 lovely daughters, a lovely wife, he could be buying them soo many things with that he could be spending time with them right now instead of doing this, he realised it too but couldn't really put it in his mind but i think it got to him. 

He managed to convince me to take 1 toke, i am actually going to diapoint myself etc so i breathed it out without pulling it into my lungs and you know what i feel proud about it. 


I will probably never smoke weed again, the one which never ever brought me anything good in life and just pulled me back from everything i wanted to achieve.

Everyone said I wouldn't get high the first time I smoked

And there was more...

I could once again dream of my future like I could as a kid.
I could accept the hardest parts of my past and learn from them to shape my actions in the future.
And for a year

I would look at the city from atop the hill down the street and see not the city before me

Weed helped me say things I had waited a long time to say.
For me, a terrible trait when you lose yourself on a path of self-destruction.

And

While high I would write things without fully understanding the purpose or significance of writing them. I would also act without fully understanding why I was doing the things I was doing. I was not in control of my own mind... I was out of it.

I even thought smoking weed saved my life. Up until I lost the best connection I have ever had with anyone else on this planet. I also scared a handful of amazing friends in the process...

I thought I was saying goodbye to someone who had lost their way. I thought that they went off the deep-end

But I went to far in the process. It took me too long to put the pieces together and I lost irreplaceable connections.

Words alone cannot describe how sorry I am to everyone I affected. And the truth is

I can't keep living in the past. And for the very first time

I dropped all of them, my enemies) tried to make my life miserable by convincing others to hate me. I had enough

After settling into a new apartment in a new town, though, I had met a really cool guy, and after a while he told me he dealt weed (ents seek out other ents subconsciously, I swear). I was so excited. I had started smoking more than ever in huge amounts. I had a solid connection and life was good. 

Unfortunately, I'd buy a bag. I couldn't afford to pay my bills. I had nothing.  **How did I get here?**  Weed used to fill a void, but now it just makes me feel empty. I needed a  *change*  so I decided to leave my new town after 8 months. 

I'm back home now, I am nothing more than a ghost. And despite everything, I am more content now than I have ever been. I don't have my stoner friends egging me on to smoke. I can, for the first time in my life, focus on myself and getting back to where I need to be. Now I go for walks everyday, I even go wogging (another redditor coined the term, it means jogging so slow you're practically walking). I've spent time getting to know my mom and grandma.

I started smoking in my late teens

Innocence is funny, an older nerd got my lan group into weed.  Pretty soon no one was gaming at lans, everyone would run out to hotbox a car and then they'd come back and look at videos or dick around on the internet.

All of this was annoying, perfect drug, we have all heard these lines.  my young adult brain starts whirring.  i could just try weed once, then i would immeditaely quit and i could prove how lame this drug is.  

to say i was / am naive is an understatement.  I tried to research things as best I could, instead there are insane levels of 11-OH-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC, and a hundred others.

I am writing this post well over a decade later.  I am nearly 30 years old.  In between those unsure first steps with cannabis, a bong, and a volcano, much has transpired.

This is not my first attempt to quit.  I can think of eight serious attempts and countless less effective tries.  I have quit for women and school and G.  I have quit to get better jobs or prove things to myself or for art.  These 8 attempts all lasted over a month

My friend was right about one thing - marijuana never ruined my life. I got through school, life is good.

So why am i quitting?

The biggest danger of marijuana use

I have plenty of reasons to quit:

* Clarity
* Concentration / Focus
* Patience
* I am never sober
* Finances
* It runs out
* Sketchy people
* Disrupts natural ways of being happy and feeling good
* Consistency / Responsibility / accountability / reliability / maturity
* The cycle of high / sober shrinks my world via dependency - too much playing it safe
* Work performance
* Wrist hurt from grinding
* I always want to quit after i toke
* Its a lot of work / time to get high, toke, smoking a couple bowls can easily take 30 mins to an hr
* Getting high is predictable and quite honestly boring.
* Simplicity - I did just fine before weed

I want to learn patience, I want to savor those feelings just as they are.  When I am lost in the doldrums aka the meat of life, I want to have the grace to smile and deal with the tedium constructively.  Mostly I just want to be myself, lucid, clearheaded, flaws, faults, no reason to further deceive myself.
 
I have a friend who has never even wanted to try any drug.  I asked him about this, and they were always bugging me to try. I started asking them ""is it the best thing in life?"" no one ever said it was so what am I missing out on? dry eyes and sore lungs?""

Anyway

""My peers, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness - it is all that I have - and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well."" - Franz Kafka

And for the techies - someone asked on y combinator if mj helps with coding.  A few anons said maybe

Not me. I'm of the opinion that lighting things on fire and sticking them near your head to breathe just sounds like a bad idea all the way around.

I'm for legalization though. The idea of outlawing a weed that does less harm than alcohol is ludicrous.

I experimented a bit as a teenager. As I recall

I think intoxication is a natural state of mankind, actually makes you a better coder. If anything, I think good coders learn the natural rhythms of their bodies and minds, then maximize their performance based on that.

Now can it make you think you're a better coder? Sure thing

I don't think it was helping me at all with my anxiety (like some people suggest); it was making it worse because I was constantly worried about my consequences of using (getting arrested

7) I have so much more time on my hands. I chose now to put my energy into running, cooking, reading, my relationships, and experimenting more with makeup (since I now have a lot more time before work every morning!). I am having so much fun discovering all of these new and exciting hobbies; many of which are making me look and feel better (the compliments from others helps to reinforce my decisions too).  

8) I wasn't addicted to weed, anger and sadness I have. It will be a process of healing, but I am confident I can do this too.  

9) I will never be rid of my addiction. I have control of it

10) I'm more proud of myself for quitting than I have been for anything else in my 30 years of life (more than my bitch of a degree, but I gained a lot of self respect out of that loss, and it is so worth it.

I had no idea this ""innocent plant"" had such a grip on me until recently... so many people's stories struck a chord with me that I thought I'd share mine as well.

I'm currently 26 years old but started smoking at 18 right before college. Damn

I was accepted to a fairly prestigious engineering college in a state university that also happened to be a famous party school. And party we did... but work always came first, then crack open a case of beer and roll some J's. We worked hard and played hard and they were separate. At the time, I felt weed was aiding my life; it was a great way to de-stress and decompress, it was a great motivator to finish a project knowing I could smoke a celebratory bowl afterwards. I honestly thought my life had improved due to using marijuana. I told myself that maybe I had minor clinical depression, or ADHD, or anxiety issues, or was just plain naturally lazy

Fast forward to graduation... I got a good job in my field, my measure for success was if I could make enough money to pay all my bills and also drink all the booze / smoke all the weed I wanted. Within a year of working in my field, I realized that I hated it and could never see myself doing this my whole life... but it paid well, and it allowed me to reach my goals (pay my bills + drink/smoke all I wanted.) Every day I woke up with a feeling of impending doom to go to work; smoking a bowl took the edge off for the first couple hours, but generally I'd spend 9 miserable hours at the office, then jam as much THC and booze into my body as I could. I had a reputation as the resident party animal, always down for a drink or 10, but she had sex with me, I totally let myself go; I'd smoke my chillum and sip a bottle of whisky on the way home from work

I think the sobriety is making me mushy

We've been together for 1 and a half years now; I am purely a social drinker, but never did anything about it; over the last 2 months I developed a business plan, found a partner who shares my vision, quit my job and am on the road of entrepreneurship. I finally wake up happy and with an ambition for success.

Which brings me to the topic of weed; starting a business is NOT easy, or making mistakes, or forgetting things, or letting calls go to voicemail, because I was high. Not going to the office, I'd take a hit or 2 before showering in the morning, maybe a bowl over lunch, hit another bowl and ""take a break"" for TV. By 5:00

It was yesterday that I realized I had to quit RIGHT NOW. I was doing some work across town and planned to meet my girlfriend afterwards... but realizing my house was on the way, and realized I'd been putting my family on the backburner, fell out of my hobbies, and hadnt seen alot of my non-smoker friends in a damn long time. How many times had I used the excuse of being ""too busy"" because I was baked and accidentally watched 4 hours of Star Trek in a row? Or told my parents I wasn't able to visit because I was looking forward to a lazy Sunday of getting baked on the couch all day? 

I hate dwelling on the past and feel its a waste of time to regret... so today is the first day to right the wrongs of my past. Time to get my life on track, but I'm optimistic as well.... I haven't smoked a cigarette since April 9th, and weed has been a godsend for helping me quit... its actually causing me much more worry to quit weed than cigarettes. But if I could kick the nicotine habit, I can kick this too... although I did not expect the first day to be this difficult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the end I am not upset that I smoked. I actually think the only thing it did for me is remind me not of how much I used to love smoking

There have been times this year where I've burnt away an ounce of marijuana to myself in less than a month. That part of the habit doesn't bother me too much, but I think a sober me would have prevented that. I want to say ""sorry for spacing out for 5 years"" to my friends and family, but would feel ashamed and stupid.

There's a lot more I'd like to say about how (in the long-term of things) marijuana has truly put my life on a path I'd rather not have walked down for this long

I know I am only two weeks in, but I held strong. I have had more alcohol than usual, but not to an extreme. One drink when everyone is smoking so I don't feel completely left out. I plan to cut this out soon. I've never really been a drinker.

What has helped me and may help you if you are contemplating quitting:

- I gave away my smoking stuff. Pinch hitter to one roommate

- I also gave away my stash to my roommates. 

- Picked up a hobby. I learned to shoot a gun for the first time at a gun range. (As a girl

- Decided to knit everyone a Christmas present

-When cravings hit

-Everyday I make a post it note with the day clean I'm on and put it on my monitor. When I feel weak I look at the number to gain strength. 

-Walking twice a day. Clears my head.

-Music. Listening to music sober is a new experience. Loving it. 

-Reading Leaves. I may not post a lot but just reading and knowing others are out there fighting this fight with me helps a lot. 

-Learning to cope with the anxiety in better ways. I downloaded some relaxation audiobooks and have been listening to them when needed. Not sure if they really help

I jumped off the mountain I climbed just to fly rolling paper planes over cough syrup lakes, exhaled ambition, and ashed out any remaining sense of purpose. Wisdom texted me but I didn't feel like responding.

Smoked everyday...decided I wanted to quit...so I quit. relapse. quit. relapse. quit. relapse. quit. relapse. quit. relapse. QUIT. relapse. quit.

I think that most everyone can relate to this. So how am I clean now? It's actually pretty simple:

**Step 1:** I bought a silicone bracelet that has ""LeavesStrong"" written on it. I never had to explain what it was to anyone

(Addiction has a weird way of tricking you into forgetting why you quit...the bracelet is a constant reminder that your brain cannot ignore)

**Step 2:** Told all of my friends I'm not smoking anymore. I got a lot of the typical ""oh for the millionth time"" type of comments

**Step 3:** Set a goal of not smoking ever again. In the past, but that is honestly a FAIL GOAL. You are setting up a date to work towards failing. Fuck that shit, don't do that.

**Step 4:** DON'T FUCKING SMOKE! Do not let your 'scumbag self' get in the way of your tiger blooded winning session. Doesnt matter if you have convinced yourself its a good idea

I had a brother and I was the youngest child and only daughter. My family started moving us around when i was nine and we continued to move for years. In the end I have moved over 25 times in my life and have lived in 9 different states. Even though I love moving this has caused some issues in my life. I don't trust easy, I couldn't maintain friendships or relationships over 6 months, I could change who I was in an instant, and once I was gone I was no longer in contact with any one from my past.


We grew up poor

2. If you accept help you are weak.

3. If you go to a therapist you are insane.

4. If you can't do it on your own

Now don't get me wrong I love my mother to death, I jump into fights, I am EXTREMELY angry. That has been my biggest obstacle in my life is learning to get my anger out in a healthy way and not punch holes in walls or black out.


**My Use.**

I started by drinking at 14, I weighed 93 pounds.


 The last time I truly drank I drank 13 shots of hard liquor, as well as cocaine for the first time in my life. I also drank an entire bottle to myself on top of it all. My lips were a dark blue and my body started to swell, I threw up over 50 times that night, and who knows why I woke up but I did, I'm grateful for that. I couldn't drink for a year because the smell of alcohol made me want to and sometimes vomit. 



When I was 16 my grandmother, a couple joints and blunts, and gravity bong hits. As well as hash oil and other variations of that method of smoking. My family grew medical marijuana for 3 years and that didn't help my use much.The 5 years of my use I also used heavily adderal, ecstasy, molly, salvia, LSD, mushrooms



**Why I got sober**
 

 Then one fateful night the Feds came to my rave I was throwing and in the end I was caught with 43 pills of ecstasy. I was facing 5 years in prison and up to $25, because I didn't want to go home and become a stripper again. I had done it for a year and was tired of being disrespected because I put myself in that situation. I was afraid to go home because I would be living out of my car or living with people who still use. I stayed in treatment because I was scared shitless.  Then I did another 3 months in out patient treatment, and then living in a sober house. Which is where I still am today.



**Withdrawals**



I had withdrawals from marijuana and honestly they were pretty intense in my opinion. I was irritable, honestly, that one scared me alot. Through out my first two months my brain was releasing THC so there was at least one point a day the first month where I was literally high. Then the second month there was one point every week were I was high. I also was extremely sad and depressed and numb... I thought those would never go away


Due to the amount of LSD and DMT I smoked my vision is now changed



**Why I stayed Sober**



Its not like I didn't have the opportunity to drink or use drugs even though I lived in a new city. One of the main reasons I stayed sober at the begining was because I had A LOT to lose, and numbness I kept trucking on. Knowing that if I were to smoke again or use again I would be blocking out even the smallest bit of happiness I could get. 


I say and hear people laughing in the meetings around me and in my sober house, to ask for help, and to let people in. That it is okay to let someone go and do what you need to for yourself. I learned to say no. But mostly I learned that happiness can and will be reached the longer I am sober.



I still have my bad days and rough spots but over all I'm a happier,000 to a year and a half on probation and less then $500 in fines. Those will be expunged off my record after probation and I wont be looking at a felony.

I think I'm struggling to quit, but I'd like to share part of my life story with you right now. Maybe we can work together on this for a minute

When I was a teenager, ""Drugs, please."" or something, because people just wanted to give me free drugs. I moved every year because of my mom's habit of moving every year. I think the lack of friends and an unstable home environment lead to me wanting to fit in and I just went along with whatever anyone suggested. That and I think a lot of the kids that gave me the drugs just wanted someone to get high with. Once they learned I was down for anything, they'd come find me when they wanted a drug-buddy. I was a risk taker, daring, ready for adventure

Well, living with friends, renting apartments when I have a job. 

I dropped out of high school when I was 17. Since dropping out, but I've kept smoking weed. I don't know why I've kept smoking weed, it isn't necessarily a good thing for me and sometimes I feel like it's bad. I'll smoke a hit off any bowl or joint offered to me. I don't usually smoke a lot in one sitting, but I have my own one-hitter and on days off I'll smoke one every two hours or so. I also smoke every day after work.  I don't smoke a lot at once, but I smoke every day. 

I spent all day yesterday hanging out with my awesome boyfriend. He doesn't smoke like I do. He never did drugs and only ever started drinking and smoking weed when he got to college, and I felt really good about that fact. However, I've already smoked today and I know I'll end up in the same pattern all day.

I think it's the monotony of that pattern that I'd really like to get away from. It's boring, even though things are going well for me now, therefore I smoke weed? That's my hypothesis. I have lots of interesting hobbies, but to be honest, I'm bored with my life. I don't have any money, I'm not passionate about my job, I never went to school after I dropped out. I am an artist and musician and I do shows and gigs occasionally and some of the cool kids like my work, and I wish I never heard of Reddit. 

I think I'll be happier and less bored if I quit smoking weed every day. Perhaps I've got my cause and effect backwards, especially the last 5 years, and I'm impressed with my work. It just feels like I'm not that person any more. I want to be, because that person is super cool, but I'm just not. I'm more ""mature"", quieter inside, calmer. My new work reflects that. I'm plateauing and I know it and it sort of depresses me. I feel like maybe I shouldn't give up, but I don't know. I feel like part of me has already given up trying to be who I was. I guess I just recognize the fact that everything has changed

* 
We are an egalitarian community and I want to keep us that way.  I liked, nothing else. Wisdom can come from people at every point on this road and one poster should not be considered differently from another.

* 
Counting days is something you do *for yourself.* If you ruin that achievement it should be you facing you

* 
Maintaining the ""prestige"" of a high badge number is a motivation to lie about a relapse -- lying

So I strongly encourage you to count days. Talk about them -- post and tell us where you are on your road to quitting.  But at the end of the day you should be counting them by yourself

Again, but I think this is the best decision.

I wanted to come here
I'd like to state before I start that I am not an expert or a specialist by any means

For repition I'll say again that I am not a specialist or anything and this isn't taken from a textbook

In my opinion there are two different types of addiction

Physical can be described as a patient in the hospital on pain medication. Pain medication infiltrates the brain and works on the chemical messengers in the brain, so when the pain killer is continually prescribed the brain eventually 'depends' on getting the certain neurotransmitter effect, and stops producing it's regular chemical messengers in the brain. So when the patient stops taking the prescribed pain killer their brain is now abnormal in that it isn't producing all the neurotransmitters it needs to be fully functional, resulting in withdrawal. 

Mental is the second method of addiction and is extremeley less dangerous. My best example of mental addiction is World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft doesn't change your brain, and I'd have to agree that it is mentally addictive. Playing WoW grants joy, and as such when a person is doing something less fun than the amount of fun they perceive playing WoW will give them they long to play the game, becuase what they are really intereseted in is just having the best time.

If you agree with how I've defined the two types of addiction you can make your own assumption about cannabis

Cannabis is both mentally and physically addicting. I'd like to tackle the physical aspect first, as in my example of physical addiction, has a direct effect on the brain and does change the neurotransmitters in the brain. However, the withdrawal symptoms of cannabis are very minor, a small headache, maybe a loss of appetite, but nothing that serious and easily faced and beaten. 
Next is the mental addiction of cannabis, in my opinion, the majority reason people become 'addicted' to cannabis.

I have been smoking since my senior year in high school which accumulates to about 8 years of smoking. I have been smoking consistently throughout and since that time buying an 8th every 2-3 days.

So today, and just live my life like I have been...half assing finding a job, and smoking to forget real life problems. As I was on my way to follow my weekly routine and pick up to smoke, I was in my car looking for my wallet, and of course like the title says..it wasn't there.

I had a total of about $170 in there with all my credit cards including my drivers license. Now, but instead of mere frustration, disappointment and guilt was engulfing my body to the point where I realized this incident is what's going to push me to quit.
Why this particular incident? I have no idea. But, I was quite the extrovert; making friends wherever I went, and being the ""life of the party"" at most events I attended. I always exuded confidence wherever I was and actually ENJOYED being that guy. Whenever my friends and I participated in sports or games or an type of competition I always had this thirst to be the best. I was so passionate in everything I did regardless of the situation or what we were doing. ..Then... I found weed.

I cruised through my university with a bare minimum GPA and graduated after 4 1/2 years. While attending, and I would ween off my smoking, but it came to a point where I couldn't even last one full day without craving that hit..The worst part about this is that all my friends were in the same boat as me, but we were all satisfied with what how we were living our lives.

We would meet up EVERY SINGLE DAY to smoke, before a movie, after a movie, before eating, after eating, basically ANY available open time we had. So, fast forward a little bit and now one of my friends moved on to take care of his family business (received his degree), another dropped out of college and now works at a best buy
After college, and for 2 weeks I actually quit. But then I went directly back after those 2 weeks, and haven't stopped since...the worst part about this is that in the past I used to smoke all day everyday with my friends, but now I was smoking all day everyday ALONE. I was not going out, I was staying home all day, just smoking and doing nothing at all productive. I was supporting myself with whatever money I had made throughout my previous jobs, including support from my parents, had ALREADY paid off her loans

So pressure was mounting on me because I could never be as successful as my sister had become and I didn't really have anybody to talk to, this is so much fucking easier said than done. I just kept smoking and time literally flew by, and now I'm 25, lacking confidence, jobless, and trying to quit weed... god I seriously disgust myself.

While my family was using their hard-earned money to pay for the home mortgage, it reminded me where all my cash was actually going. This was almost a blessing in disguise because I realized how much of my time and money went into this plant. Not only time and money, but my passion had diminished, and my craving to be the best was not there anymore. I used to be proud of who I was, but now I go into the public feeling ashamed of who I am.

I've become the person that I always found most pitiful. I've become the person that I never envisioned myself to be. I genuinely don't know if this post is even comprehensive or if it even has a point. I just wrote this to tell myself this. I don't want to stay this weak loser that I've become.

Every, irrational thoughts) I think ""well, maybe I cured my anxiety through my own will and weed wasn't the culprit. I'm sane now. I can go back to smoking""


So I start smoking again. At first it's all cool. ""Nice! I knew I could handle weed. No anxiety and I've been smoking for a week. This is great!"" but after a few weeks I start noticing the thoughts come back. The irrational fear that I can't pin down to a particular thought. The constant anxiety of an uncertain future. Worrying about nothing

I tell myself I need to get my head straight and fix it, the weed has nothing to do with it.

The thoughts seem to be real logical paradoxes. I try to tackle one


Then things get so bad (these past few days) where I can't even enjoy the present moment at all. Imagine all the mental energy we use to experience the world. 95% of it is wasted fueling anxiety. 5% I have left to live life. I *know* it's the weed... yet I don't at the same time.

I grew up in a ""Christian"" home, up until around 16 or 17 when my part-time job got me out of going. I stopped believing in god as a youth because of all the social injustice I witnessed in the world, among many other things. I had a few close friends from the church up until college, but needless to say I was very ""sheltered"" in highschool. 

I didn't attend any parties, I was more of a social butterfly after hitting the gym and getting my body in the best shape of my life. I made more friends, still never drank/smoked/partied. I had a 4.0 GPA going home for summer break after my first year. 

I started hanging out with a girl I had talked to in highschool some
The girl I mentioned is now my wife, listening to music, and smoking pot. 

When it came time to go back to school in the Fall, lemon skunk, etc. We would get high as a kite all weekend, and had some truly amazing experiences. We couldn't stand the distance any longer, so I transferred to her school the next Spring and we moved into our first apartment together. 
We started smoking every day, and my GPA plummeted. I really didn't give a shit about much else but getting high. 

We got married at a court house during this time also. After the semester was over and we both did horribly, and would often leave my job early to go snag pot because it was really lax. It increasingly became apparent that I needed to be high all the time to function, or so I thought. My wife would plead with me to cut back, we have to pay bills, etc. I turned a blind eye.

She was able to quit any time

This is the juncture of my life were I jumped off the cliff of any remotely responsible resemblance of a mature adult. I met a lot of new people - many who also enjoyed smoking herb. This was the most laid back place I have ever worked. The manager smoked bowls behind the store every few hours, so every shift seemed like one big party. I should note I NEVER drank up until this point in my life. I started having a few beers here and there, people would offer me shots and bong rips at parties, it hardly felt like ""working"". 

The next few years, drink more when I got off, and smoke the whole time as well. I'd wake up hungover and feeling like shit, and I would hit the bong to nurse that. I'm so lucky my wife never left me during all of this, maybe she should have. She has always loved me with all her heart, and she knows I have great potential. 

What should have taken me one more year to finish college took me three. I recently graduated last semester, I had to have the 12 pack. A few tokes of weed was never enough, I needed to rip huge bong bowls worth. I have tried several times to quit smoking and drinking, but I've always failed.

I am 26 now, I was very close to having to pack up my shit and find another place to leave until I sort out my life. The thought of losing my son made something snap in my brain, and I've never been so committed to quitting. For the first time ever, I boxed up everything I had (vaporizers, bowls, papers, jars

I've been trying to work out all I can, I didn't want to be labeled that the rest of my life. I constantly thought about the fun times I'd be missing, all the social drinking events, drinking during sports outings, hitting the bong, etc. I know realize the best life for me and my family can not include alcohol and pot. 

I thought for the longest time, and I surrounded myself with musings of those found in r/trees. Denial came easy. I've been smoking for seven years, drinking for five years, and I've wasted so much of my life just being a zombie on the couch. I've never quit for longer than a few days. 

I am now on the job hunt for programming jobs, anxiety, nightmares, sweating. I'm determined to make it over the hump this time and stay strong.

I don't have too much to say. I feel like I'm starting to settle into life as a non-smoker. However

Quitting has had some great benefits. I can really feel the difference in how clear my mind is. I've saved a ton of money. I picked up a new hobby (shoutout to r/homebrewing). I no longer have to watch out for the police

Some things I've learned:

* Cravings are temporary. Understand this implication

* Keep yourself busy. However

* Always think about why you *want* to quit not why you *have* to quit. There is a big difference. Learn that difference and you will find your true motivations.

* It gets easier. I no longer have withdrawal symptoms and cravings are few and far between. Stay strong. It will be worth it

1332271935.0,r5if5,Seven days: a status update,,27,0,4,"Hello there

In the past I have tried to end my usage many times, but honestly it's easy for an addict to keep deluding themselves that ""it's not addictive"" and ""marijuana doesn't have withdrawal symptoms"" if they never try to abstain from usage. I kept up this game for several years, and it was this perceived zero risk of addiction that first induced me to try marijuana.

First

In the last seven days I have experienced a flurry of emotion. I feel remarkably clear-headed at times. Just yesterday I took a midterm and was amazed at how quickly I was computing the answers. I was able to hold much more information in my head simultaneously and more accurately, which is up from probably 1 dream every 2 months that I remembered whilst using daily. The double-meaning of weed causing you to give up your dreams is not lost on me.

Unfortunately with the good times have come the bad.. I have also felt anxious and irritable

Fortunately it seems that the insomnia is slowly fading away as I'm actually getting tired at night now. Near the end of my usage my tolerance was so high that only primary reason I smoked every day was simply to get to sleep at night. Being restless and sleep-deprived is incredibly torturous and one of the primary reasons I gave up quitting in the past

Unfortunately since quitting I've also noticed my appetite decline, which I am also trying to lower my dependence on. This morning I had a bagel and coffee for breakfast after being sleep-deprived and I'm just now getting over the feeling like I'm going to throw up. 

The anxiety is still there at a low level as well, and all the denial in the cannabis community tends to make you feel like a failure. But this experience is different: the symptoms are teaching me how much cannabis messes with my most basic of cycles, sleeping and eating. Overall it is motivating me *not* to give in, because I never want to deal with feeling this crap again.

Background: I'm 28, and acid was always my favorite drug.  I had not done acid in over a year prior to this weekend.

Over the past month I have really wanted to quit.  When I realized I couldn't

Normally I would smoke a lot during any kind of trip.  And the thought of taking two hits of acid without any weed was actually really scary.  I had one bowl left on Saturday.  I decided to take the two hits

I took the first hit at about 10:30am and just went outside.  I didn't smoke, and started coming up.  Once I knew I was tripping, I started thinking about smoking, why I wanted to stop, how fucked up it was that I couldn't stop, etc.  I just kept walking and thinking about that.  About 4 hours in I came home.  Making it through the first 4 hours without smoking was something of a lesson.  I didn't need weed, I just wanted it really bad.  I COULD make it without it.  When I got home I felt a very weird feeling, it was like they were gasping for air but they were clearly gasping for smoke.  That is fucked up.  My lungs are so used to getting smoke that they know as soon as I walk in the door what is going to happen.  They need it.  The only withdrawal symptom I have felt is related to this in that my lungs from time to time feel like they really want to smoke.  I decided to take the other hit of acid (I definitely didn't want it laying around my apartment if I was going to take a hiatus from drugs and I thought it might make things much more challenging but it really didn't).  I then took my last hit of weed.  Thinking about it just now has made me want to smoke more than I have wanted to in a while.  I put my bong under the sink in the kitchen where I had been trying to put it the other times I wanted to stop.  I haven't touched it since.  I went back outside for about another 3 hours, it was fine, I started a journal and I suppose the first day was the hardest.  I went outside for most of the day.  My appetite wasn't too bad

In the past running out of weed for even just a few hours has left me a little bit crazy, and even on vacation I was usually trying to find some.  

If I had not been well-versed in acid I would never have tried this alone or probably at all

I guess I just wanted to share my experience because it actually has really surprised me

When I was still smoking pot, the more pronounced it was. I did some research on it and found it was something called depersonalization, which is basically your body's defense against anxiety (which I am a sufferer of). Nothing felt real to me anymore, I had to convince myself that I was seeing something, or hearing sounds. Nowadays, it's so bad my life is nearly indistinguishable from my dreams. Except my dreams could never be as much of a nightmare as my waking life.

Ever since I quit smoking pot (which started as a tolerance break, because apparently (according to my therapist/doctor) the anxiety altered my gastrointestinal system. When I quit, I was still in my first month of college. I had to drop out because I was having panic attacks in class. This horrible wave of anxiety and nausea would hit me and I would be forced to leave the room, and now this happens on a daily basis whenever I leave my house (to varying degrees). I can't get a job, I can't go back to school, and I can't live a proper life. As stupid as it sounds, my life was better when I was still smoking pot, anxiety/depression/depersonalization ridden wreck

4 days ago I tried taking medication for my problems (citalopram), and then proceeded to feel awful the following days. So I can't take medication, meditation doesn't help, and the therapy doesn't seem to stick with me.

But I failed many, so I wanted to introduce what I hope will be helpful tips to maximal success. I'll list them then give my reasoning.

When NOT to quit:

-when you're going on vacation or making any type of short-term temporary relocation

-while or right after you're high

-any day in which you've already blazed


When TO quit:

-during the time of day you would normally smoke

-under the most average/normal conditions possible for you (e.g. not on vacation


1. Vacation. This may seem like an easy head start and a good opportunity. You're with family, defeated. The time until you decide to quit once again (usually months) is how long it takes you to get over this sense of defeat and helplessness. Avoid this feeling at all costs. 


2. After you've gotten high. I can't tell you how many times I decided to quit either while I was high or right after I came down. This is useless. Your mind is in complete non-fiend mode after you toke, but when the next day comes, it's suddenly VERY difficult and your will is completely demoralized by these contrasting feelings. Again, we're back to defeat and powerlessness over self.

To be clear: it's okay to make the decision whenever

The idea here is to pull off what is ACTUALLY a strong start. You need to be there to say no to all the fiending compulsions when they are at their strongest

1326776803.0,okfml,The Beginning of the End,poopyfarts,24,2,12,"Today is my first, I may have smoked a few times in the 2nd year but never turned myself back on to weed.

I started smoking again after I sprained my ankle when I was 20. Dancing was what I loved, drinking, and smoking heavily. I eventually healed, but kept the substance abuse habits with me.

Years later, girlfriends, sex partners, money, talent, and a job. However, all of those things have faded away and I'm back at square one with my life at one of the lowest rock bottoms ever.

I stopped doing the things I loved and that inspired me

Anger, and overall depression is a lot more common in my life than it used to be. I can't blame weed, but I can say that I'm no longer happy unless I'm high. I can literally go from ""I hate the world and tonight I'm gonna get even with society"" to ""LOL thats a funny cat"" in just seconds with a good hit from the blunt.

I remember after quitting weed, more creative, more attractive, and cultivate an even stronger sense of well-being and fulfillment.

My sources of ""natural highs"" were: Dance, exercise, lifting weights, writing, praying, doing daring shit, girls, drawing, exploring

I haven't felt the success high in ages. When I wake up in the morning I get high and go on the computer. When I go to work I smoke a blunt while driving there. When I get off work I smoke on the way home, I do it high.

I think my brain has forgotten how to think in a positively inspired manner. Some people can get high and still get up and go places. I can, but skip out on going to the DMV. I'll browse reddit for hours, but not pay my parking tickets. I'll unlock weapons in battlefield 3 but not finish a single page of studying. Procrastination is a separate problem, but I don't think being high all the time makes it better. Having no initiative, inspiration, or strong-minded determination has made me very ""mentally weak"".

My last girlfriend I was with for about a year. One of the issues we were concerned with was weed turning into the center of our relationship. I promised her it wouldn't, and therefore always had to smoke around her. She smoked a lot too, but I think I definitely outdid her.

I don't want to call it sobriety, or sources of over-stimulation like porn or gaming or violence.

There are a lot personal problems I need to work on, hard to stay disciplined and focused when your mind is in the clouds, hard to be social when you're in your own world, and hard to get the ""get-up-and-go"" when you're stoned off your ass.

I look forward to this joruney. It will be hard as I anticipate a large amount of anxiety, rage, aggression, and aggravation to follow me for the next few weeks, or even months, but fuck, I want my life back. There are better things in life. Maybe I'll smoke again in the summer and be the type to just take 2 hits and pass, but right now I need to take my life back in my control.

I appreciate the supportive posts from people here, but I can do it! I have to!

Well i must have been a damn infant when i started because i had barely hit double digits [10] when i was first introduced, but she did. Might have been my parents just had a nasty divorce and I was fucked up. Mentally, emotionally and spiritually. I still blame this on rap music (haha) but I can't rid myself the idea she pitied me, wanting to help subdue my stress.

Worst mistake of my life, well hearing The Offspring because i was so little. I remember being afraid to tell my cousin i was interested in trying it because i didn't want her to tell my mother. I knew she smoked regularly and attempted to hide it from me. Attempted. I was too damn smart for my own good. Connected too many dots without being exposed to them prior. Well, to my surprise, when the spiderman pipe came passing along to her hands, for the 3rd time, I finally spoke up and asked if i could. She reluctantly handed it to me, and i dont remember the rest of the day from then on.

I just remember not feeling ""high"" that first time. Feeling so, then proceeded to the beach to smoke again. The only memory i have from then on is being so, so... out of it. I vaguely remember telling my cuzzo that i couldnt feel my legs as we were walking on the sand... then it was all blank. 

She still tells me to this day about it. She regrets it so much, takes my drive away to accomplish things. My ambition is suffering, and i know it. I dont let it show to her thought for her sake. but the thing is, she has now graduated from medical school, acquired a great full time job in her field, has her own place and seems to be overall happy. Shes now 24, and still smokes. Im now 18, because i didnt want them to judge me. 

I began fucking up in school, being on probation for 3.5 years (when it was originally a one year term), being on house arrest 8 times before i turned 16 and so many other things i dont wish to say. I began living life in constant desire to get high. Believe me when i fucking say i did just that. Ive spent no less than $40,000 on marijuana, amongst other narcotics. I wasnt the kid to buy a gram here and then. It was buy as much as my amount of money i had then would allow me, which was always a ridiculous amount because I stole it from my fathers wallet (passive aggresively taking my ""pain"" out on him and his alcoholism) ive longed stop doing so, but i cant help but thinking why he never noticed. Was it because he was drunk so much? Was it because he knew what and why I did it? Ill never know and ill never ask him. Im talking i was buying quarters everyday, i wish i knew someone like me when i was slanging on and off (age 14-17). i would just get lost in my thoughts when i was high, and say so verbally

I have now told myself I need to quit for more than two years. I continue to spend handfulls of my NOT hard earned cash on this bitch. Yes, which is every minute of every day. ive accepted the fact of being ""perma-fried"" because i can literally go 3 weeks (as far as ive made it in 8 years, when i was in rehab for my benzo relapse) without smoking AND STILL BE HIGH. IDK is it because i smoked some of that synethic shit for a little while, or is it the fact that i seemingly have algae made of THC coating my cerebral? I know this is a marijuana thread... but i have no doubt in my mind this WAS a gateway drug. I was into every drug under the sun except for heroin, pcp and crystal. (sadly both ive tried except pcp)
but i became addicted to xanax, all that jazz. Lost every single one of my friends, lost respect from my family members, and myself. All this time of hurting others, i was high on this bitch, amongst other things.

Im now about to graduate high school, along with my mothers on xanax &amp; alcohol, AND that bitch), have no license, and have no drive. I want to stop. I really truly do. I cant. I moved across the country to rid myself of drug influence in my sunshine state, and the whole 3-day fucking car ride with my father to my destination, i reeked like a straight plant. I was sweating so profusely it smelt like bud. THC was literally oozing out of my pores. He kept asking me if i snuck some nugs with em, that told me i needed to direly stop, some kid, and smoked reggy. First time in my life that i had done so i can say. Then i returned to my grandmothers car and acted like nothing happened. Nothing did happen. It was as normal as walking is to me.mI fucking hate it

I've slowly come to realize over the past few months that almost all of the problems plaguing me lately are directly linked to how much marijuana I smoke. I'm 23 and started smoking when I was 18. For the first few years, far cheaper than my alcohol habit. I did it infrequently enough that I always got very high and never spent much money on it, and as a result I became extremely complacent with marijuana. My family has a history of alcoholism, and so I was always very careful with alcohol and it was the only drug I was ever worried about becoming addicted to. But while I am very comfortable with my relationship with alcohol at this point (I was certainly close to alcoholism a couple of years ago), it seems that weed snuck by undetected and has created many problems for me without me even realizing it because I wasn't paying attention.

I smoked mostly in moderation for about 3 years, right? But about 2.5 years in, the habit morphed into smoking every weekend, and then during the week, and then every day. And now I've been a daily smoker for about two years - multiple times per day for the past year and a half.

I had other rationales for why I didn't have a problem. I'm lucky enough to have friends/relatives all over the country (US). So I like to visit them over long breaks, clearly if my years are peppered with periods of forced sobriety with no withdrawal effects, I'm not addicted, right?

More rationalizing. My smoking habits seemed to be fine in college, the fact that I could outdo everybody I know academic-wise while being stoned 24/7 meant to me that my marijuana habit was completely fine to me. So clearly I don't have a problem, right? However, my grades did start to slip during my final semester, and now I'm in grad school and my grades are the worst they've ever been, and on top of that I failed the entrance examination that everyone is supposed to pass at the start. Thankfully I can take it a couple of more times, but I know why I failed

But after graduating college and moving across the country for grad school, I am high. And because of this, it makes all of my work take longer, giving me even less free time. Very few of my cohorts blaze either, so I am extremely socially isolated. I've almost forgotten how to make friends with people who don't smoke weed. I tend to leave campus immediately after class so that I can go straight home and blaze, never even giving anybody a chance to talk to me or vice versa.

Now that I've explained the rationalizing

In the past 6 months, and turning down the invitations from my friends to go do something fun because I'd rather be stoned. This time last year, I had an incredibly fulfilling social life and way more friends than I knew what to do with. Now, moving to the other side of the country, I was totally expecting that I wouldn't have the social life that took me 5 years to develop in college - that makes sense. But because I have been spending all of my time smoking weed alone, my social life has barely even gotten off of the ground. I'm lucky to hang out with friends more than a few times per month. This is not what I want!

I used to have a bunch of hobbies - going to concerts, juggling, etc. But that has all faded now. Even when I do have the energy for these things, I frequently don't have the money. Just this last Friday, one of my favorite bands of all time was playing in town. I really wanted to go, but I knew I didn't have enough money because I needed to buy weed. So I sat around and smoked weed instead. Then just a couple of hours ago, I randomly remember that I HAD ALREADY BOUGHT A TICKET WEEKS AGO! I was just stoned when I bought it and had forgotten! AHHHH! This is not what I want!

I cursed myself up and down for this. I decided to compute a number I've been terrified of computing ever since my habit became daily: how much do I spend? Thankfully

No wonder I'm so fucking broke all the time. No wonder I have zero free time. No wonder my social life has become nonexistent. No wonder I failed my department's PhD entrance exam (thank god they let you retake it). It all seems so obvious in retrospect. Weed

I don't think I'm totally prepared yet. I'm in the middle of quitting smoking cigarettes right now (3 weeks cigarette free! my record is 3 months though)

Smoking for me was one of the most important things in my life. I would like to believe that it wasn't *the* most important thing in my life but at the end of the day it probably was. I wasn't a completely dysfunctional person; I was still intelligent, I still had some friends, I still had some money. I wasn't a soulless person; I had a moral code that guided my choices, I had a vision of myself as a teacher, a father, a cherished friend. I wanted to give back to the world; I didn't steal, I didn't cheat, I drove the speed limit. I smiled. 

I was smoking every single day without fail; I was smoking a minimum of three sessions a day and during each session I was smoking whatever amount was required to get me ripped. Sometimes it was just a pinch; sometimes it was a blunt. More than once it was a few blunts. 

I wasn't a happy person before I started blazing. I struggled with insomnia from when I was a young kid, it sucked that a girl I cared about left me, it sucked I was stuck in a small town, and it sucked that I seemed to experience constant physical pain. I felt like there was almost nothing of value that could come out of my existence other than more pain, despair, and an eventual death, complete with a rainy funeral that very few would attend. 

I wasn't really one of these people who was a jolly ""Let's get high!"" kind of person. Smoking was fun but it became a self-medicating act very quickly. The idea of smoking socially was strange; why would anyone want to take medicine with me? I mostly liked to put on some music and walk through a nature preserve near my home with my dog

Deep down I really wanted to quit. I could see so many pitfalls that I was falling into because of my addiction. I was isolating myself from everyone; I was blowing my disposable income and preventing myself from getting ahead; I was getting older but not growing. On one hand I felt that my usage was actually making me smarter; I was able to grasp spiritual principles for the first time

I tried a bunch of times to quit. I could almost always stay clean a week but after awhile I would lose the desire to quit and would revert back to daily smoking after a single puff. I would rationalize and justify getting high as a remedy to my boredom, my self-diagnosed medical problems, my self. I really wanted to stop but not as much as I wanted to continue. ""It's not the right time"" became a mantra.

I decided to approach quitting differently. I never half-assed using, and I started living simply for today. I admitted to myself and to others that I am an addict. I decided not to listen to my own rationalizations anymore; I decided that it's okay to be depressed, it's okay to be afraid, and ultimately that it's okay to *feel*. I don't have to live my life from the high tower in my mind, that's been my choice and as such I can choose differently. 

During the past month I have noticed some changes in myself, walking on eggshells, or avoiding eye-contact. I'm smiling more. 

Some things haven't changed however. I still want to smoke. Sometimes so badly that I have to call someone to prevent myself from slipping back. I'm still afraid of the future. I don't necessarily like my life anymore than I did before I started using; I still have the same complaints. Some days are really easy and peaceful

Despite the negatives

I really don't know what the future holds

Its week 3.  I havent smoked any bud.  Ive been around it and damn the temptation is strong, or even tipsy.  Ill have a beer with friends or a glass of wine but never ever am I drinking alone or drinking when others are not.  I also have smoked a couple cigs but that was after some amazing sex so that I feel is kind of justified, am not really tempted to do any more.  

Physically my lungs are a hell of a lot better.  I am skating longer and harder with less want to be all huff and puff after.  Its more of a slow hard breathing.  Also I am much more in tune with my body as compared even to week 2.  I can feel everything much better (or worse cause my wrist with tendinitis loves to flare up even when writing so I have a brace on it most of the time)  My throat is almost completely 'healed' and It only really hurts if I chug a lot of carbonated liquid (soda/beer) or have acidic/spicy food.

Music is just as fun as it was high, so bands like ratatat and pretty lights I am able to listen to again (for the most part) without wanting to light up.

Things I have noticed is.  The classes I am in currently are 3hour long classes (Brutal on the mind leaves me wiped out but content) and we of course get breaks through the classes.  This is when I would normally either ditch the class

***TLDR Summary:***

Mental fog lifted

Reflexes

Happier for longer periods of time as compared to on weed

Paitence still low, i will just walk away

Still tempted if I am around it and smell it but I walk away 

Drinking only socaily but never much (Most Ive had in one sitting is two beers)

During breaks and down time I am skating and keeping my self physically active (unless I am playing games)

Noticing the world around me in a much better clearer cleaner light and am in love with it.  

Life is fucking good.  Loving it.

Uhh thats a very quick summary...I wish I had more time but I legit have 1hr between classes and would love to eat and what not so I may or may not come back and edit this to a more proper more detailed post (leaning on prob not)

Peace and Respect

TL;DNR summary at bottom.

   A friend showed me this and I figured this is where I will start my own journey/journal of quitting weed.  Ive been smoking for about 5 years (I've never seen that written and that scares me) and I just don't want to do it anymore.  I smoke constantly and as a result I am constantly high.  I would wake up in the morning and smoke a joint before I got out of bed, smoke every chance I can.  It even got bad enough for me to leave friends and parties to go back to my place to smoke (alone) so I could continue my high.  It is rare for me to be sober and I hate that, it scares me and makes me so disappointed with myself.  It's affecting my school and grades, but worst of all its affecting me physically.  And I always promised myself I would quit the second it began hurt me physically, well...I am spitting bloody mucus in the morning, not every morning, but if I smoke hard (which is what I ususally do) I will wake up in severe pain and then spit blood.  It doesn't last all day usually Ill spit a couple times then drink some water and I am fine but, and this has been going on for a couple weeks.  I couldnt run a block if i wanted to.  I need to quit weed, I will smoke the resin, im done.  With that being said....I need help advice anything....

   Maybe a little background on why I smoke.  First reason I would give is my anxiety and my PTSD.  Short story, you know.  Another reason I smoke is cause it helps sleep, appitite (I rarely eat without being high), and my add.  Its also become such a part of who I am.  People know me for weed, for my stonerness, for just being high....(that sickens me too, I know they love me for me but the weed is just a huge part) But really I guess I smoke because I just don't want to deal with life. 

   So what helps quit?  What advice is out there??  What helps with the anxiety

   I plan on keeping a journal type deal and posting everyday here till I am clean for at least 2months(ill probably stick around).  And I am going to meet with my therapist (to help myslef control the PTSD without weed).  But what else

   Please, but they dont know weed like stoners do nor what it is doing to me....

   I've read some of the other posts and I am actually crying right now.  I feel like with this place




TL;DNR summary
Smoking for 5 years.

Smoked for fun, but now because I can't stop.

I am scared for my physical health. I spit bloody mucus/chest hurts in the morning

I want to quit

Help....please.

1313775138.0,jo1wp,Warning: This is long and perhaps familiar.,throwMJaway,30,5,7,"*I wrote this to myself about a year ago. Though I was fairly depressed at the time

**The Letter:**

Saying I over-think things is an understatement.

Take my happiness

It goes something like this: 

I know I was happy at some point in high school…and definitely earlier. I remember sitting in my parents’ den, because I didn’t have enough friends, because I didn’t do well on a test or in some class. I fought with my mother. But I was comfortable. I didn’t worry about money or politics or my place in the world. 

But now? Now, confident in my popularity, top of my class, good at everything I tried. And in the first few years in my first career – again, confident in my abilities, liked by my peers, going somewhere. 

But what happened? 

Is it the world? Becoming an adult and realizing that the world is a terrible, healthcare, crime, the economy, real estate, wall street) and that there’s nothing I can do about it. Is it me? Are these just part of the pains of becoming an adult? Realizing I’m not a kid anymore, that my life is essentially meaningless

Or, easier to depress? More… thoughtful? Honestly, I’m not sure.

And there I go, go with the flow and remind myself that I have a great life. I’m mostly healthy, I love my family and I’m not poor. That makes me better off than 99% of the planet. Today, I’m opting for the later, less whiny path. But tomorrow or the next day, I’ll go through the same mental marathon again.

Which brings us back to that 25 million dollar question: What about the MJ? How does it fit into this thoughtful picture? This year I will be 30. Though I’ve done a lot of fun things in the past few years

There’s something wonderful about smoking. It’s like I get to hit pause on all my worries… sometimes. Sometimes, smoking lets me relax, enjoy the sky, the world around me. They say you should stop and smell the roses. Smoking lets me do that. For a price. 

It seems my genes are not those of an addict but an over-indulger. Quitting is physically easy. I’ve done it off an on for the last few years. Then again

Thinking thinking thinking. Even if it’s not caused by smoking

I think about smoking all the time. When I’m relaxed I think, ‘smoking would make this better.’ But all smoking does is give me an hour or two of mush brain followed by cravings to consume anything within reach. Is that really so great?  

And yet, you stop hanging out with your friends and forget your sister’s birthday. THEN, it’s a problem. And yet…besides the fact that having a clean house makes me happier to be there, what’s it matter? So what if I have a dirty house? I have nothing to smoke tonight, but I still don’t want to hang out with Claire. And I probably would have forgotten my sister’s birthday anyway. 

The truth lies somewhere between thinking the drug has no effect on me and blaming it for all my problems. But where? Damned if I know. 

I like smoking. There have been high times in the past few years that I would add to my lifetime collection: watching the sunsets, my oasis. Wandering around my parent’s old yard, reminiscing on my childhood. Walking to the library, watching the sun glint off the ocean. Kayaking back to the cabin house with my husband. Having spacey discussions with him under the stars. 

I’m almost in tears thinking of how wonderful smoking can be… but what a fiend it makes me! I smoke all weekend and end up dangerously depressed on Monday (because I NEVER smoke before or at work). I smoke before visiting friends who may or may not notice that I’m not playing with a full deck. I think about it all the time when I’m trying to cut back. 

And my husband doesn’t like it. I don’t want him to be disappointed in me or angry at me. But, able to just go with the flow and be happy in the moment. But if I’m not the driven one in our relationship… Someone has to be at the theoretical wheel, and I can’t be when I’m high.

So why should I quit? I might not get any real benefit from smoking…but I guess you could say the same about video games. Can I honestly only smoke when I have nothing better to do? I’m not sure. But if the house is dirty? Smoking will make it more fun to clean! If I have things I need to get done? I’ll get them done and reward myself with a little ‘fresh air’! 

Round and round we go. 

One side reminds me that I’m trading tomorrow for today and my future for right now. I won’t get healthy or end the paranoid thinking if I don’t stop. I’ve already proven to myself that I can’t have it and not smoke it. If you’re going to quit

Then the other side rationalizes that the end is near, when it’s too dark to go out anyway. Just one more month and then I’m through.

But I said that last time.

But I’ve gone from enjoying it a few times a month on the weekends to roasting bowls every night.  I’ve blown off going to lame movies with friends so I could get back home and toke.  I’ve more or less stopped working out in lieu of sitting in front of my computer

My life is going well—my job is awesome and I’m appreciated there for all the hard work I do, and I’ve gone from very articulate and quick-on-my-feet mentally to sluggish and spacey in my thoughts.  I feel like people can tell my head is clogged with resin, and it makes me less confident when talking to other people, especially higher-ups at work.  And I start to obsess about how I shouldn’t smoke so much as soon as I get high (though I seldom have that feeling when I’m sober, and especially not when smoke time nears).

So, it’s not self-restraint I want—it’s to just not obsess about weed all the time, to be able to go “oh, hey, I haven’t smoked in awhile and I’ve got nothing going on tonight.  Maybe I’ll have a bit and watch The Big Lebowski before bed.”  The way I think most people who smoke casually do.

Anyway, and I'll need to look seriously at quitting.  My dad smoked for 35+ years, so to some extent I'm fighting against biology and my genetic predisposition towards addiction.

1294591442.0,ez0ec,My Story On Quitting (Long),leavesaccount,24,1,6,"I wanted to share my story here

To make a long story short, just the generally misunderstood, highly intelligent, introverted, but also very geeky people in highschool.  Middle class suburban kids, some of whom were more ""indie.""  

We weren't as a collective, the people who are quasi-friends with everyone people. Also known as ""don't give a fuck.""  Naturally, smoking weed was the norm.

It took a great amount of time/independent research of my own to conclude that I wanted to smoke weed for the first time.  And smoke I did.  For the many months and years that followed

Nothing seemed to happen.  I kept my friends, and smoking later in college, I was falling behind in school and so too were my friends.  I became lazy, unmotivated, and desired nothing but what would make me immediately happy, even if there were significant long-term (but largely unnoticeable in the short-term) costs.

Marijuana made me patient for trivial matters

**Fast Forward**

Today, and will not at all hide my own ego in saying so.  **It has been, for me, a 180-degree reversal.**

My friends however have all fell to low-paying, as well, though that's a pretty new development.  

Between four people, and not a *glimmer of hope for any one of them*.  Opportunities abandoned all-around, their impulsivity (a trait none had before smoking) is a deterrent to any real improvement.

**There is one very distinct difference between my friends and I.**  I quit without my friends, and frankly, I am surprised that one is even still capable of breathing.  

I quit when, but it set the stage for a ""new me.""

I ignored those who I considered my best of buds (no pun intended), it was a far easier path than to lose all potential.**

In the one year that has followed, that I cannot afford such friends.

**Final Thoughts**

I hate to say it

And I should comment, marijuana will not kill you.  It does, however, have a very large impact on your state of mind, your energy levels, and any desire to improve yourself.  **The biggest danger, I believe

The biggest risk is that you lose dreams

This isn't, nor what may have come as a result of taking that first step.

You see, and earned back a very driven state of mind that I  had not seen since my teens.  When I smoked, I saw only the barriers to the first step, ignoring the benefits of the path that followed.

Do not

If you really want to quit smoking weed, the very first step.  However, it does begin the million mile journey that lies ahead.

1363703748.0,1ale8g,Lurking No More- My Reasons for Quitting,LatKava,27,5,10,"Greetings Leaves

First I want to share how excited I was to find r/leaves- as all of you have experienced, and how even pretty moderate use has come to have effects in my life that I don't appreciate.  This dichotomy is, in my opinion, one thing that makes it so tough to completely quit smoking.  Unlike, say, a heroin user, who (try as he might) can't really justify heroin as a mostly harmless/potentially helpful substance, it's so easy to say, in a ""Marijuana is so harmless and fun and non-addictive that I just can't quit

Having said all of that, and, like many of you have probably experienced, tend to crystalize most strongly in the morning after waking up from a trees-induced coma.  So, I'd like to capture these thoughts while they're still strong, because, as many of you have probably also experienced, and then it's on to the next bowl pack

I'll start with the experience of smoking itself:  When I first started smoking about 6 years ago, and set it free.  I could think creatively, reason through problems in novel ways, was more talkative, more adventurous, more social.  I wanted to get high and go DO and SEE and EXPERIENCE!  I felt more aware of my emotions, and more in touch with the memories/events/people/interactions that caused them. Sure, but even that was a positive experience as we would often smoke and have long discussions about our family history or experiences from childhood that we felt were formative in some way, but it was rare

Fast forward a few years, why I felt like I needed to smoke in the first place.  These days, from the 1st puff my brain feels foggy and slow, my emotions feel dulled and flat, colors and sounds seem muted, I have trouble maintaining a singular line of thought, and I lose interest in almost every sort of activity.  I don't have the physical energy to want to do the things that I love to do (as an endurance athlete from a young age all the way through college, so this is a big deal to me).  I don't have the emotional or mental energy to want to engage on any meaningful level with anyone around me.  I don't have the focus or motivation to get any type of productive task that requires much thinking done (sure I can get high as fuck and clean my room, developing or enhancing a set of skills to further my career).  

I've found that these problems manifest themselves almost completely regardless of to what extent I'm able to moderate my smoking.  For years I've gone back and forth through phases of trying to moderate my smoking, or only smoke once a week.  There have been times (like the past few weeks), however, when I've been able to only smoke 1-2x/day, or only smoke after a certain point in the afternoon.  I've found that even this level of moderation isn't really helpful to me.  If I plan on not smoking until 4:20 (how cliche, right?) or not smoking until just before dinner, I can usually (sometimes) succeed.  But, only later in the day.  Also, but a huge part of my self-concept revolves around being an athlete and caring about my body.  You can imagine the cognitive dissonance I've been putting myself through almost daily, 2 packs of sour gummy candy

So, and that is definitely the case for me.  Not in the sense that I have terrible underlying depression, or severe social anxiety, or anything like that.  On the whole I'm a pretty well-adjusted, healthy, happy individual, so I'm not using pot to hide from the terrible demons lurking in my closet.  What I find instead is that smoking daily has provided a consistent buffer between me as a conscious being, negative, I suppose) the emotional hubbub.  As though I'm only approaching my emotions with a riot shield made of trees between us.

This has endless potential ramifications in life, ranging from ""I felt unsatisfied with my life, so I dumped my girlfriend of 5 years.

I'll get high rather than experience and feel that frustration as I should, then, whether it's complete stagnation or 5% stagnation doesn't matter- I want to move forward and upwards in life

I recognize that I have unbelievable potential, I have the capacity to be as healthy as I want to be, as productive as I want to be, and as happy as I want to be.

1358306391.0,16nuty,Smoked the last of my stuff last night.,QuittinWeed,25,1,5,"I don't necessarily need a lot of advice or anything. I'm just gonna talk for a bit. 

My friends and I have always been incredibly close. There's a group of four of us who have been best friends since 3rd grade. We even played our first talent show together in 6th grade and kept a band together all through high school, and that was totally fine. I hung out with them all the time still. People were really surprised all through high school when they found out I didn't smoke, since I was the singer and guitarist in the band of the biggest stoners at school. 

The reason I started smoking was pretty silly, and this girl across the street from me was having a party. At the time, all my friends pretty much lived at my house, so once the party across the street was over, my three best friends/bandmates, my girlfriend and I all went back to my house. When we got there, my girlfriend and I were about to go upstairs and my friends said they were gonna stay outside and smoke real quick. Seemingly out of nowhere, too. I guess being a somewhat jealous and insecure type as well—I wasn't going to pussy out and go inside alone while my girlfriend smoked with my best friends—I decided to partake as well. A lot of people say they don't get high their first time...not me. I had been smoking cigarettes for a year or two, I felt so weird. 

I distinctly remember not having that pleasant of a time the first time. Everything seemed to be pulsing. It was so intense. Too intense. But when I said this to my friends, since I already hung around them all the time, I sort of got fast-tracked up to their level within a few weeks. That year was probably the best time of my life. We were the best of friends, I was together with my girlfriend, and well all just hung out, smoked, and played music pretty much all day for a year. School was a joke for me, National Merit Scholar, and then go to our drummer's house everyday and smoke and play music until his parents told us to go home. I was the first to leave for school that summer

I went down to school and knew nobody. I decided that since I'd been smoking a half eighth or so everyday for a year, though, I had made some friends and started smoking wit them again. This was the time when my smoking was at its healthiest. Over the next two years, my smoking went up and down, but it really was never a problem. I went abroad for a year, and for the first three months or so, I only smoked two or three times because I didn't know where to get it. 

I should probably backtrack a bit here. In high school, I was really just going through the motions until I could get out of there and go smoke weed. Well, when I quit for those three or four months when I first went abroad, it all came back. Depression, anxiety, being fat, lazy and lethargic

I was with a friend and weed came up, and bought hash from them. Once I realized that I could do this anytime I wanted, I started smoking every day again. I got lazy and anxious again, and my wit and charm and all that gradually dissipated. I got back to the states where good weed was once again easy to find, and smoked everyday since I've been back. 

I figure that I'm at around 11-12 months since I went a day without smoking. I certainly haven't slept without weed in that time period. Honestly, less witty, less willing to go out and do stuff. Because it's not like I ever got high and didn't go to class, or sat around all day smoking. But I might as well have, because I put my brain in this weed cycle; the best part of every day was around 9 or 10 o'clock at night when I would smoke.  

This week I have some serious shit I need to get done, and then I'd be done with it. I was driving to my spot, and something came over me...I just threw two of the joints out the window. Which was fine, because given the size of the joint I still had, I probably couldn't have gotten any higher anyway. So I smoked this joint, chilled for a bit, and then drove back. Strangely, in the sense that when I'm high

All was going well until earlier tonight when I caught myself looking in the back seat of my car—had I perhaps accidentally failed to throw one of the joints all the way out the window? And that's when I realized that

Back in October I decided to quit cold turkey. I was depressed, so I flushed my stash, threw out my paraphernalia, and erased all drug contacts from my phone. It was pretty easy to quit - easier than I expected, actually. The fact that it wasn't available made it more definite in my mind to stop thinking about it completely, which I did.

Now, but I find myself looking for contacts and thinking about smoking a lot. And I don't even know why. My life now is much more improved:




* my boyfriend is happier with me
* my day is much fuller (I cook
* my skin looks nicer (and I don't look tired all the time)
* I smile more
* I think clearer and my vocabulary/speech has improved significantly
* I'm friendlier to strangers
* I'm more productive (I always got a lot of ""highdeas"" before but would never really act on them - now I'm actually following through on a lot of them
* no more anxiety when my stash starts to dwindle (and no more sketchy dealings with dealers  - like getting into vans with a bunch of big dudes to make a transaction)
* lots of $$$ saved
* I smell better and take better care of myself (hygiene-wise)
* no more paranoia

So how is it that we can see the damages that trees does to us, whereas in the past 68 days I don't think I've cried once, and I've been the happiest I've been in years. Why is it so easy to be entranced by the dark side?

I now realize an alcoholic is someone who loses control when they drink, and this 12 step thing has worked for a lot of people and deserves another look - with a fresh perspective.  I used to think smoking or drinking would offer escape from my problems or emotions.  I now realize that no matter how far you run, or where or HOW you hide, your problems will have to be eventually faced and sorted out at some point in time.   I used to think that smoking and drinking only impacted MY life, I now realize how selfish that thought and act really was.  I used to think that smoking raised my consciousness.  I now realize how much I missed living in the present. I've missed a lot I now realize, and it's hard not to feel regret. More guilt, more shame.  I smoked to forget.  I forgot what it was like to have dreams.  I forgot what it was like to have nightmares.  I forgot what it was like to be awake and present.  I'm still trying to wake up.  I hope I will.

I still struggle with a LOT of things - words like 'addict', the aforementioned guilt and shame, and poisonous ideas that my mis-wired brain keeps suggesting - things like: how much can you talk about or listen to others talk about NOT doing something?  How can you have a good time/party without booze or weed?  I'm such a funnier/more like-able/more creative/outgoing/better person when I'm drunk or high.

1341541197.0,w3x8g,Addicted to smoking herbal incense blends. Using /leaves to share my story and struggles. ,DontSmokeSpice,31,8,23,"Hello.

I have been smoking pot since I was a teenager. In the past two years I stopped smoking a lot of pot because I would cough until it was uncomfortable to continue smoking. I always wanted to quit smoking and felt like it was holding me back in many ways. The longest I quit without being forced (I was on probation as a teen. Can you guess why?) was three weeks! I was quite proud of it!

After one night of boozing @ a local bar a friend drove me home. We stopped at his house first. He was smoking Mr. Nice Guy herbal incense. I rationalized that it was not reefer and would be OK to take a single hit. I was already drunk

Long gone were the days of scoring a bag of weed from a buddy. This was much easier. I simply drove to the store and legally purchased my smoke. Spice didn't make me cough and in my opinion is very powerful compared to MJ. Being addicted to this stuff is worse than pot if you ask me. Incense blends would zombie me to the point where I would fall asleep through out the day. I would wake from my stupor to puff a few hits and continue my stay in dreamland. 

The past few months I would purposely not buy a large amount of spice because ""this is my last sack"". I would try to smoke it up as fast as possible so that I could start my journey without dope. This usually resulted in me waking up as early as 6am and driving to the gas station to score a bag. Did I mention this stuff is easier to acquire than reefer? 

At one point I went as far as ordering ""pure"" JWH-018 powder off the web via a western union transaction! I bought five grams of white powder with the intention of making my own incense blends. My friend and I that purchased the powder ended up smoking it all before we made any herbal blends. Yes

I am 27 and have a son that is almost nine years old. I feel like I have been a poor parent a majority of the time. I am involved in his life and see him quite often

This morning I attempted to smoke the last little bit of ashes left over from a 10g ""WTF"" pouch. After I was done I threw away my glass pipe and cleaned all the ashes and empty spice containers from my room. I have not smoked anything since this morning. 

I was under the impression that spice like synthetic MJ products were banned state wide in FL as of July 1st

I am sick and tired of feeling helpless to addiction. I have told a lot of my friends how I feel about smoking and my addiction. My mother is aware also. She usually attacks my addiction which immediately makes me defensive about my use. 

I plan on not buying or smoking any herbal blends tomorrow. Day one is over. I look forward to updating a successful no spice day two tomorrow!

Before I got pregnant I was an everyday, my friends new I was the biggest pothead out of all of them, I did stand up comedy and the stoned chic was kind of my angle. I was prpud of myself, I could smoke anyone under the table, and no one had as good a stash as me. 

I got pregnant and quit smoking for a while, to help cope with nausea and the fear of what was to come with my new life. I stopped smoking 3 months before my kid was born. She came put perfect, so so so perfect. For about 4 months I didnt smoke, I was so sleepy from staying up with her I didnt even want to. I thought it was out of my head and my life.

I struggled though, full time job, great friends, happy relationship, and did stand up fairly often. Going from being really social to being a stay at home mom was crazy hard. Working did not logically make sense for the family, my fiance and I beleive me not working and staying with her is absolutely in her best interest, maybe not mine, thats what counts. Life at home with her was lonely, he tells me how important my job is

To get more to the point on 4/20 my fiance and I had my parents babysit our girl and spent the day with our best friend and got high. It was awesome and while we were syoned my fiance agreed to buy a bag. This started our lives as smokers again. I would smoke with him after our girl went to bed every night. Some days I would smoke during the day and go for a long walk with our daughter, and for the most part only smoked at night when she was asleep. 

A couple days ago my fiance told me he wanted to quit, but I couldnt do that to him, it would make it so hard for him, not to mention I think would lead to a bit of resentment. 

So here I am, drowsy, and I miss it so much. I think its hard not just because I loved smoking so so much, but also because i felt like it was my only connection to the life I had before I became a mom. It was nice to have time to clear my head, have an hour or two to do something for myself that made me feel human.

I've been browsing through this subreddit for almost 5 days now and the first thing I want to say is just: ""Thank you!""

I'm 21 and I've been smoking pot every day for almost a year now.
My last weekend turned out to be the most sad and fucked up weekend in my life
I have a girlfriend and we are in a relationship for nearly 6 years now and I can't put it in words how much I love this girl. Though I never had an other girl in my life I can tell that she is ""the one"" for me.
So back to my last weekend
On Sunday my girlfriend finally decided to be honest with me and she told me how much I changed by smoking weed. We were both crying and I was so upset (not with her
We we're arguing about our future
As you can read above
I neglected other friends
She told me that her feelings for me have lessened (that's the point where I start crying
Smoking weed every day was annoying me before
For me it's just not worth smoking a plant and loosing the girl I love for this.
So the last 5 days I didn't smoke any weed (though several times I had the opportunities) and it isn't hard for me at all, or live a wonderful life together with the girl I love? Unquestionable!
I've talked to many friends (even to those I neglected) and I can't say how thankful I am for every single one of them as they were totally honest and understanding with me. (Which I never thought

I don't know what to write anymore as I'm still an emotional wreck and just want to share my thoughts with some people who maybe experienced the same.

Reading through this subreddit the last days I also realized that I'm not the only one struggling with his life at the moment and I can just repeat myself by saying thanks to every single one of you.

Quitting made everything better. Except for the cravings. They got worse and worse every single day

Suddenly it wasn't there anymore and after 42 days, and regretted it instantly. When I was sober I was desperate to be high, but the second I got high I was desperate to be sober again, and being high sucked. But now that I'm sober again all my mind can think of is being high again.

Have any of you troubled with this? 

Any good ways to keep the motivation going on past a few days? I've been trying to find a good way to reward myself for being sober, a month but can't seem to find a consistent idea?

This was the best decision I have ever made. It get's better guys, it honestly does. I'm on the other side now, and you all can be too. 

You have the willpower to do this, when you slip-up, don't get upset with yourself. You need to remain equally as forgiving of yourself, as you are dedicated to quitting. Maintain a positive attitude about it, and trust me, before you know it, everytime you get high you will start to realize you wish you were sober. It doesn't take long for sobriety to become appealing once your leveled out and able to think without your head in the clouds.

I run my own business mainly working from home making it real easy for me to smoke weed whenever i wanted to. 
I make pretty good money working from home so getting weed and getting high whenever i wanted to was never a problem (really bad combo if you want to quit) recently reflecting on my business I thought over the last 5 years weed never really affected my work but it really did,  I would rather get high now and forgot my problems and worry about it the next day, but then the next day you get high and keep pushing those problems back ...its a bad cycle. 
 So I tried to only smoke after work hrs, I've been in a few accidents already because of this urgency to get high.  I was hit with a pretty bad cold last week and thought this would be a good time to stop.smoking.  when your really sick with a cough/headache/ dry throat it makes it a bit easier i think to start to stop as the urge to smoke is not as strong.  Its now been a week and Im no longer sick and now feeling the need to light up again, but I'm also feeling good and almost getting that crisp feeling back again /feeling and thinking sharper/ - i want to continue this and I want to be done with this habit.

1366382902.0,1cofno,"Crazy dreams and old, haunting memories - What quitting will do for you, and what it won't.",WinterHill,25,10

*Preface: I'm on day 4 of not smoking. I did quit last week as well, I have even more desire to quit this week because I can see how little smoking did for me this past weekend. Through all of these quitting attempts, I'm really learning a lot about myself, and why I started smoking so much in the first place.*

As most people here know, especially this week, my dreaming has come back full-force. And those dreams have not been particularly pleasant. The reason they have not been pleasant is because the last 2 nights I've woken up from dreams about my ex-girlfriend. I won't go into detail about our relationship, but it's important to know that we had an on-again/off-again relationship for several years, and it was very emotionally damaging to me when she left me for another guy, and I still had strong feelings for her.

Last night, thinking of what I could have done differently, and if things would have turned out differently if I did. It also made me upset that some of the good times I had with her were replayed in my dream, bringing back old feelings of affection that I had for her. Honestly at that that moment, I would have smoked weed if I had it, not because I wanted to be high, but because I wanted those terrible thoughts to just GO AWAY.

From the fact that I'm still dreaming about her (which I don't like one bit), I just numbed myself with weed and buried the emotions deep down without dealing with them.

While it might be painful for all of these old memories be resurfacing now, but only covered up.

**My Advice:**

Which brings me to the point of my post; a word of advice to others about what quitting weed will do for you

We've all read the inspirational stories on /r/leaves about how people quit smoking and how much it has improved their lives

What I'm getting at is that quitting weed **won't** automatically solve all of your problems. In fact, with a bit of effort. Quitting will lift the hazy cloud of smoke in your brain and allow you to clearly see and attack all of your life's problems. 

Many of my own past quitting attempts have failed because after I quit, be aware that despite the new outlook and fresh energy you will get from quitting, you still need to be prepared to tackle the rest of your problems as well, or you'll likely end up right back in your old smoking habits.

My current mind state compared to when I first quit is night and day.  For probably the first two weeks I was completely miserable.  Everything reminded me of smoking.  All I wanted to do was give in and smoke.  I felt like I needed to smoke every time I was challenged with something that was even mildly difficult.  Anxiety and depression set in.  Every excuse possible went through my head about why it would be ok for me to just smoke 'a bit'.  In the past when I quit I would always cave in but this time I tried to pay attention to my thoughts and use them as reason of why I needed to stop.  They were all thoughts of an addict and I can't get by casually smoking.  It always turns into full out dependency.  

Time heals.  I started trying to keep myself busy.  I've been meditating for two weeks now and I really think that this has helped.  I started keeping track of not smoking in chains.cc and then I added a meditation chain.  What I really think it comes down to is building my discipline.  Sticking it out.  Being proud of keeping the chain going.  It might seem trivial but it felt great being able to get through the day and add another day of being clean to the chain.

I also can't say enough about how important /r/leaves was to me when I first quit.  I didn't think I needed a support group because ""it's just weed"" but that was my ego talking.  Being able to read about other people going through the same struggles as me and then being able to have an outlet to vent and hopefully help others was so helpful for me.

1351355167.0,126e83,Day 15 - My Life Without Trees so Far,discunected,24,3,21,"Hey guys and gals

I quit smoking weed a day over 2 weeks ago because I was becoming increasingly antisocial; I would smoke

Since quitting my life has been a living hell.  Last Thursday someone slashed one of my girlfriend's tires, everything was fine.  Then, on Monday morning, someone slashed one of my tires.  I didn't have the time to immediately swap it out for my spare due to a test I had not prepared for (too busy replacing a tire and working my 1-day-every-2-weeks job).  

On Tuesday I received a job interview offer, and went to the interview.  It was fucking cutco.  Motherfucking Vector Marketing is a subunit of Cutco Knives, which, if you don't know, is a pyramid scheme.  The interview and application process was a waste of 2 hours, and my car still sat on a flat.

I took the test on Wednesday and did reasonably well on it; everything was looking better.

I was supposed to be paid on Wednesday from some work I did two Sundays ago.  The money never came.  I called my employer (a major merchandising company) and they said they'd look into it.

On Thursday I went to class like normal, giving everything I had into the torquing of the tire iron, when the bolt coming from the axle sheared off.  Now my car has no spare and one of the rear tires runs on 4/5 lugnuts.

Yesterday I got a call back from my employer.  They said that someone on the corporate level had messed up inputting my worker ID number and thereby payroll had skipped me.  I can expect my money *next Thursday*. 8 whole days after I am supposed to be paid.  It should be mentioned that I have been working for this company for 4 months without any hitches in pay, if it was rent, I'd be in debt.

Now it's Saturday and I just finished my 10th application since Monday.  Today was for Subway, even though I have 2 tests on Monday.

Somewhere in there I managed to rub open a dime-sized wound on the back tendon of my right foot.  I don't have any first aid kits nor money to buy one

I guess I just need to vent a little

I've been smoking with my boyfriend every evening for about 4-5 years now. Poverty, boredom - they all played their part, and we chose the easy route.

I used to be one of those people who begged the people I loved to not smoke and become dead inside when I was younger (everyone in my life smoked it as I was growing up). Now look at me

It started with one joint a night, has now turned against me and I feel like I have hit rock bottom. In the beginning I used it to shut my chaotic brain down, but it now gives me all the ability to think about everything that is wrong with me, and not change any of it. I lie all the time to the people I love and do not recognize myself anymore. 

I started antidepressants properly about 2 months ago. It had finally gotten to the stage of staying on them, becoming my father (alcoholic type of sociopath who phones up his kids drunk by accident and comes out with little gems like 'which one is this?').

1342336636.0,wl39y,I can't seem to kick weed despite trying numerous times. ,Blackfish007,22,0,5,"Hi Leaves

I haven't been able to quit smoking weed on a daily basis, out of work and looking for a new job. 

Although I started smoking with friends in social situations (I didn't even buy for myself alone until probably my sophomore year of college), even though I could skate by with B's and C's with minimal effort (my college experience was punctuated with countless frantic all-nighters). 

Before I say anything else, and my one uncle). To just come out and say it, they're all depressed, kind of sad individuals (I love every one of them, but these are just my honest thoughts about them). My dad is even the best one out of them, but even he is generally joyless, not excitable, and he's incredibly smart. Ever since I was a kid, and when he was he would generally just go into his room to read (I really understand that a lot more now that I've grown up, and it especially had an impact on me when I first started smoking. 

You see, awkward, low-level depressed guy. So when I first started smoking weed my junior year of high school, it was one of the greatest times of my life. I finally broke into a genuinely nice, funny group of friends who shared a lot of common interests. In weed, I found this lovely, refreshing new vision of what life could be, and it didn't involve this thick

The problem is, and over, and over again, and it just always fails. I'm going to keep trying, but it's honestly getting a little scary. I've probably been telling myself I want to quit for about two years now. Whenever I quit for a day, or two or three, or however far I get on that attempts, I get anxious, and I just feel the need to smoke again. 

I guess I don't really have any specific questions. This was more of a cathartic experience,,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,True
1340321117.0,veoqb,Feeding Shadows,beachtimeafterthis,25,5,25,"Hi Leaves. I'm Kate.

I had planned to write this on Day 1. It's really day 3 right now, to get the days and weeks of thinking I've done down on paper and cemented before life comes along and I forget the details. But I've read almost every post a couple of pages deep when I was stoned out of my mind, and seeing people going through what i was struggling with helped more than they will ever know. And maybe this will help someone else in turn. So here goes. I'm Katelyn, I'm 22, and I'm addicted to Marijuana.

Addiction is really a loaded word though. I've seen Pills destroy people, it wraps it arm around your shoulder and tells you what you want to hear while it leads you down a side road of life. Until one day you look up and have no idea how you got to where you are. It doesn't take your life, it takes you out of life. And I let it lead me down that side road and even thanked it for the directions.

It really did boil down to me though, always out picking random strangers and striking up a conversation where I was. It wasn't an attention seeking thing I think, I just really like meeting new and interesting people. I carry that idea over into my non-people related life too. When I went to a restaurant I'd order the weirdest thing on the menu, just to try it. A lot of people say they are music freaks, but I lived and breathed it. French R &amp; B? Got some. German rock? Love it. English singer songwriters? Yeap! I tried as many new things as I possibly could, everything was worth at least one shot right? I wanted to experience EVERYTHING I could from life. From the crazy chefs in hibachi restaurants doing tricks while they cook my sushi to seeing every sunset. And I was happy.

So when I tried weed at 18 it was love at first sight. To someone thriving on experiences it was heaven sent, I did my job. I always dressed well, even as the years went on and I fell deeper into it. I ran everyday. I was the ultimate closet stoner I guess, to the point that a ton of people didn't have a clue that I even smoked much less went straight home and smoked until I forgot I was supposed to be smoking. It was easy to justify, I had a job, friends, and an apt. It was just to relax right?

When I was 20ish my dad knocked on the door to my apt and sat me down for a talk. Not about me, he had started up with Alcoholics Anonymous. It was a shock, more than a shock, since neither me nor my Mom had any idea that he even drank. I'll come back to this later, it's important.

But it didn't stay just to relax, like it was a profession or a government mandate. I got off work, I did whatever errands I HAD to get done before rushing home and smoking. Smoking alone, naturally. Having a smoking buddy didn't last long after I first started, since my mind usually went too quick and in different directions that someone talking to me was annoying. As time went on I started to see my family and friends less and less to get in just a little more smoking time, pushing people away until they eventually did stay away. I had my own little bubble, just me and the baggies on my table. Alone. Going from 'Sunshine' to alone took shorter than I would have wanted it to looking back. Eventually the compliments on my clothes or hair turned into about how I looked tired, my brain just felt like it *worked* when I was stoned

A couple things worked together to open my eyes, something about going home and going straight to bed. But he looked at me and was like ""You are cool as fuck Kate. But I'm worried about you. I never see you anymore and I know you're not going to go to bed. What are you hiding that you can't let anyone near?""

It was like a knife in my chest. I've heard it before, I was on that same path without even knowing it. All behind a mask of 'it's just something I do' I had changed my entire life to center around going home and getting high.  A friend of a friend had come up to me a couple weeks earlier than that. He said his (both of our friend) was crazy about me. My first though was 'No way, I can't let him in'. I just smiled said 'okay'. TBH I don't even remember what non stoned sex is like.  I traded my soul and everything I believed in for a chance to be bored, home alone. 

I found this place from the side of GetMotivated and started reading. I even set a goal to stop smoking, when I saw what I had become. I wasn't Sunshine anymore. I was boring. From enjoying life to avoiding it. I don't know why I did it, I was high as a kite and not really thinking at all, but I grabbed my bong and baggie and ran into the kitchen.  I threw whatever weed I had leftover into the sink before throwing my bong in after it. Crying like a baby I grabbed a skillet and smashed it.

So my Day 1 came a lot quicker than I expected it to. I have a box of Melatonin that I bought to prepare for what I read was coming. And it still sucks, until 11am ish. Today at around 8 in the morning I walked by a coworker with a stereo playing, and started to sing 'Living on a Prayer' for like 15 coworkers. At the end of it people were laughing and smiling when someone came up to me. She said 'You are really chipper this morning. You usually don't really wake up until later. I like this you better, whatever you did keep it up'.

Has my opinion on things like legalization changed? I don't think so

Some people let life happen. Some people make it happen. I lost something when I was living out of a bong. An appreciation for life maybe. And I want it back. Some I'm going to proofread this a little then I'm going to the beach and watch the sunset sober for once. Love starts with yourself Leaves

I think it helped me through that period

At the end of semester I had about two weeks to study for three exams and did absolutely nothing until 10pm the night before each one. Two of them I pulled all nighters for. The night/morning before my last one I actually ended up smoking and trying to study high, socialising or even playing video games, I would just sit at home thinking about how I needed to study, whilst aimlessly browsing the internet. I felt shit and knew exactly what I had to do to feel better but just could not do it.

I managed to pass all my courses (two of them barely) and continued to smoke through the holidays. I tried to quit once or twice but never lasted long. Once the semester started however I decided it was time to stop and threw out the rest of my weed and all my smoking stuff.

It was actually incredibly easy and I definitely felt an improvement in my motivation and energy level for my studies. I was far from perfect though and did start to miss lectures and actually missed one 10% assignment.

I gradually improved however and up until a couple of weeks ago I was really getting on top of the work and enjoying it too!

There's a quote by Tom Wolfe in ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" that has stayed with me:

""They're just beginning to open the doors in their minds-"" ""But once you've been through that door

What I saw in this quote was, or ""get out of"", using these tools. The revelations, epiphanies, and insights you get, or going though the door, would be a redundant process. Once you've milked everything out of it, you won't be learning anything new.

My continued usage was, I felt as if it was just slowing me down, a source of my brain's chemical imbalance and bringing on anxiety and depression. I knew it was a problem when other aspects of my life were really adversely affected, my academics and relationships with other people, and I knew I couldn’t keep making excuses why I could/should continue using.

Think of your body as an infrastructure, for your mind. There are things you would rather not bring from the outside into your house that would dirty it. In the same way, there are things from the outside that you wouldn’t want put into your body.

We all have an ideal vision of ourselves in our mind, we know exactly the steps needed to be taken to reach that goal. All that's left is for us to carry it out. There will be times of ""one step forward, two steps back"", and cravings may seem like a self perpetuating cycle, but as with anything worthwhile, our persistence and drive will keep us on top to maintain a net result of stepping forward.  What's stopping you from attaining that exact vision, that exact goal? Don't let yourself keep you from your most ideal.

I turned 19 and moved out with one of my friends deciding not to go to college after graduating high school. ""Ill go back in a year"" I told myself and I have been telling myself that for the last 5 years. Me and my friend started selling weed and things really just took off from there. We were selling a lot and had more weed than we know what to do with. So I got accustomed to smoking 3 to 7 blunts a day. 

All good things come to and end and we got robbed. Long story short I ended up having to move back in with my parents when I was almost 21. I cut down a bit but still was smoking about 3 blunts a day to myself. But hey

Since I turned 22 (6 months ago) I have been having more and more doubts about weed and my usage. I always told myself ""I can stop anytime I want to"". But so many times I found myself not doing something so I would have money for another bag. Im always thinking about how much I have left

I also have just been feeling like an idiot since I don't have much to show for my life since I left high school. I see everyone I graduated with now graduation college and getting good paying jobs. I have been working the same landscaping job for 5 years scraping by with nowhere up to go in the company. I feel like I NEED to go back to school. I think weed will get in the way of that on top of needing that extra cash for school. (any tips for getting back into/enrolling in college would also be greatly appreciated.)

And lastly I fee like I haven't been as physically fit as  I was 5 years ago. I went to the beach the other day and couldn't hold my breath for long at all. I have had a bad cough for the last few weeks and I haven't had a sober mind in years. I always told myself I could do it no problem if I wanted.  But even yesterday I wanted to quit but convinced myself ""one more 20 sack"" since I had already smoked that day. I want to actually accomplish that goal of quitting and feel good about myself again. To be honest with myself I haven't been really happy in a few years and have been using weed as a crutch. I want to feel like a productive person with an actual social life.

There are other reasons why I'm quitting but I feel like I'm already rambling. Any tips will be greatly appreciated

Like I said I'm 12 days clean and I feel amazing so far. I can't believe how good I feel I thought it would be hard but it's been real easy so far. I just ran out last Tuesday and didnt call my dealer. It was pretty simple actually. 

I am going to the beach July 4th and have decided that I am **not** buying a bag. But in September I'm going to see Iron Maiden

Edit: I feel like if I could become the guy who only smokes at parties and the like it would be a bigger accomplishment than actually quitting altogether.

I try to quit 2-3 times a week and never get past the first or second day.,Needhelpsota,23,3,23,"I'm usually fine until about 7pm the first day. Then i get a huge amount of anxiety. So much so i end up picking up before 10pm. It's the fear that i may change my mind at a time later that night when it's too late to pick up. It's stupid and i have an addiction. 

I have no real pieces

My depression is definitely a factor as well. In high school i saw a therapist regularly and took zolaf*. I haven't done either in about 3 years. Today i plan to call my doctor and get back on antidepressants. I stopped taking them my freshman year of college and that's also when i started smoking. 

I knew and have been told to stay away from drugs/ alcohol because my family has a history of abuse on both sides. So genetics are against me. In college i bought into the whole weed isn't addictive thing and ran with it. Huge mistake. A long distance break up sent me to the smoking every day and being high all the time phase. I haven't been able to stop since. 

I'm in my 4th year of a 5 year chemical engineering program and an about to flunk out.. My decline in grades directly reflects my smoking habits. I suck for throwing away such an awesome opportunity and i dont have time to feel bad for myself. I need to end this addiction and i need help.. From anyone.. 

If anyone has read this and is willing to message me / encourage me

I plan to eat better, find a hobby that isn't in front of a monitor, delete all dealer contacts, throw all away shitty pieces, make a visual reminder for days past, and probably start drinking heavily... 

The first 3 days are the hardest. After that im golden until i trick myself into thinking I'm doing great and i can afford to buy a gram. Lol addict. But I've never made it longer than 2-3 weeks. 

But to get past the first 3 days i abuse alcohol and sleeping pills. Not at the same time. The first day my anxiety is to high so i drink until i can comfortably pass out. The other Two days a pill or 2 at night will help me to fall asleep. As a disclaimer

I'm writing this asking for help and as reminder that I'd like be somebody and not a zombie. 

My biggest dilemma is whether or not to tell my parents. I don't think i can do this by myself and i crave there help so much. I wish i had the courage to tell my mom. But i dont want to break her heart and I'm unsure how/ if she'd accept me after wasting away at college.. My biggest regret is not telling her when i couldnt quit 2 years ago

I'm going to explain what happened as simply as possible

Anyway, at such a young age I might add, the only thing that could come out of this experiment would be devastation. And I knew this. I wanted to prove ""myself"" wrong though- I lusted for the opportunity to say ""See? That wasn't too difficult. Weed is just like alcohol and caffeine now, I'll smoke once every so often and not be an addict.""

Well I was right in that regard

For one, visiting a dream I had when I was young. It's weird. Everything is new. You might say, oh isn't that kind of fun? Well, no, it's scary. Imagine walking into your home and thinking ""I haven't been here in a long time"" when you just left for a cig. It's just, you know something's wrong.

Also, but it's like I'm wearing a layer of melted plastic. My pain tolerance has gone up way too high, too- I can withstand sticking my hand in a toaster oven. Man, I suck at english too lol.

You know when you take a huge hit, just to feel that rush of THC running up your spine? Yeah, well, that was also painful. It felt like cold acid burning through my head, or someone stabbing me repeatedly in that certain motion. 

After two joints. This all happened after less than one gram of weed. 

Not to mention I didn't even enjoy the high. I'm actually happier sober than while under the influence. I can tell now why doctors call it a depressant. that's exactly what it was. After three hits I realized I shouldn't have continued smoking. Before all the pain and torment

All in all, (some) healthy relationships, and a steady diet, (not to mention I'm straight with God) I'm actually more euphoric than when I'm inhaling cannabis! It's amazing, I never thought that was even possible!

I can now look forward to the future without constantly thinking about something I don't even like anymore

So, much better.*

We started dating almost instantly, smoking and drinking freely - it was a dream come true for us, away from the constant gaze of our parents, or a *very* strict Islamic country (where we attended high school together), where EVERYTHING was under the radar (public affection, hash, she moved into my house for a good 2 years or so, alone

At first I made it a point not to smoke before class, I'm in University, this will last forever, 4 years is a long time. I blinked my eye, and now I'm in my 4th year. I literally haven't spent a minute with anyone from my school outside of class. After breaking up with my ex, I really only have about 2 or 3 good friends, that I can call and spend time with. I want to change me for me, because I don't want to be the guy who plunges into depression after a break-up. I want to reinvent myself. 

I would smoke all day every day. 2 grams a day to MYSELF was very normal. 3.5 grams a day to my face (the way I've been smoking this past week) is usually the most I can do. Even if I come home at 9pm, that's 1/8th gone, or 2 grams. I'm reiterating the fact that my social life is non existent. I prefer spending time alone, even though I'm a very sociable person. I know it's the pot.

I'm a decent looking guy, is SEVERELY limited by how much I smoke, I never want to do anything. I prefer sitting at home, smoking pot, than going to a club/bar with friends.. Now it's too late, it's the fourth year of my university experience, and everyone has created their social circles and cliques. I go to classes, and there I am

I'm absolutely stupid for wasting so much of my time, and got scared before a midterm.. Fucking pathetic.. People think of me as ""the guy who just sits at home all day"", and it's true. I need to grow up, I need to meet people, I need to get defeat this demon. If I can't control my urges, then I'm a weak person. I've been feeling this way cause I've been wanting to stop for about a year now, but I keep putting it off

Wish me luck


**TL;DR** I need to grow up.

**EDIT1:** I told myself that today (Monday 17th September) was going to be my first day sober in a long time, as well as BF3 later on at night. I've been doing some bike riding, but I'd like to do a serious hourly ride per night, I think that would be really helpful.

**EDIT2:** I didn't smoke before class! I got home, and I'm about to take a bike ride for an hour (hopefully two). Still sober! :O

As the stress of graduate school and other life stressors started piling up I started to smoke more and more weed.

I am a type A personality

I am smoking a pack to a pack and half of cigs a day, and most significantly I was kicked out the graduate school I was attending and now am forced to leave the state to attend another school.

I used pot as a way to escape my problems but they only would get worse as I did less and less to remedy the problem at hand (my lack of studying/lack of ways to deal with stress)

In the weeks leading up to this post I have been smoking 2-5 grams of tree PER DAY!

I am tired of smoking (both cigs and weed but focusing on weed now) bc of its effect on my breathing and I am tired of constantly being high all the time.

I'm afraid of losing part of who I am if I quit.  Losing a part of me that I love.  I love being a stoner and I love who I am when I'm high and if I could just leave it at that then this wouldn't be a problem.  It is a problem though.  I have things I want to do when I get home from work, I just end up getting high and getting nothing done.  I'll be out with friends that don't smoke and I find myself getting anxious at the thought of not smoking that night.  

Went through this exact fucking thing 10 years ago.  Couldn't stop on my own so I enrolled at a religious university as sort of a forced rehab.  I feel like I became so lame during those 4 years of sobriety though. I definitely missed out on the typical college experience and it makes me sad to think of all the fun things I missed out on.  I suppose I'm afraid of becoming boring again.

I guess part of the problem is that a very close relative of mine is a fairly well known artist.  Most of our bonding is over the drugs we do together and I'm so afraid of becoming boring and not fitting with that crowd anymore.  It's like drugs are the only thing that make me feel 'edgy' or cool.

Maybe I just need to accept that I'm not cool and artistic like that crowd.  I'm just an average person in a boring office job and a weed problem.

I finally made the leap to quit after reading a post on /r/leaves, where he had many adventures and great conversations with friends. He'd smoke socially on the weekends and have a great time. Then, slowly as he continued, he began to smoke during the week, still having great conversations and fun experiences socially. Then later, he began to smoke alone. As he smoked more frequently, he began to smoke to feel normal after a day, he found it difficult to be productive after he smoked

I related very strongly to that. I had spent two nights at home the week before and had remembered my bizarre dreams both nights. I enjoyed waking up with a fresh dream. I rarely got high anymore

I talked to a bunch of my friends about it. My 3 roommates who had 3 weeks prior gone in on an ounce with me had run through their supplies, and told me he had stopped too. With their support and commitment to stopping, I decided it was for the best. I decided I would only smoke on special occasions that truly called for it.

I quit on Wednesday. From /r/leaves advice, ""I'm quitting today"". On Thursday, we had a get together at our house and a few people wanted to smoke. I invited them to my room to use my bong but told them I wouldn't join them. We moved upstairs and they took over the conversation, challenging each other to a smoke off. Carl, a fairly straightedge kid who had smoked more in the last month than in the rest of his life, challenged his former coworker, an experienced smoker who was close with local rap artists, but Nick pointed out that there were just 3 of them

After that, I felt inspired to smoke while watching Bored to Death. I always wanted to be high when any character on the show was high. But I think it's better to relate to the sober, more active characters than the high, foolish ones. It took so long to buffer the episode that my roommate left, and without him smoking, I felt no desire to break my break.

My number one reason for quitting is that if I quit, other than just keeping myself together. I will have the opportunity to thrive, rather than just function. I will be able to think and feel and experience without second-guessing myself and my perceptions. I've been high all the time for at least three years now - including at work. I really have lost touch with reality in some important ways. I've lost touch with what I want to do with my life and my time, I've lost touch with personal values. 


Pot is not evil - lots of people use it and experience it as a net positive in their lives. But I am not one of those people. It makes me anxious, and then, depressed that I've done it to myself again.

1375148000.0,1jbhaq,3 week check-in; many repressed issues finally starting to surface,koolscrub003,19,2,5,"Hey guys, and for the first time in longer than I can remember

I believe that the majority of us here have been striving to end our habit because we feel that our life has stagnated in some respect. Our dependencies may have developed for varying reasons, the problems ensued. Some of us were able to manage our weed usage and still maintain the progress society expects of us. Others fell into such a destructive cycle that eventually nothing seemed of any importance unless it involved getting high. I unfortunately fell into the latter group.

It was only near the end of my love affair with weed (3+ years of daily use) that I realized I was using solely to self-medicate my depression. A depression I never addressed nor acknowledged, I understood that I was never going to get out of this hole unless I stopped. So I did, but to be honest, stopping was the easy part. (FTR, I had tried and failed countless times prior to this attempt) As soon as I focused my energy on moving forward and not simply ""abstaining"", the idea of falling back down this hole seemed like the scariest thing in the world. Yet, I now realize that there is just so so much I have to address. And that is the terrifying part.

I am attempting to repair the relationships I had passed by during this journey, I could never shake the feeling that essentially everything that was discussed and referenced was simply ""fluff"". Now don't get me wrong, these experiences were undeniably enjoyable, but I eventually reached a place where the millions of thoughts racing through my head were enough to appease any feelings of loneliness or irrelevance that regularly emerged. Amidst this period, I broke up with an amazing girlfriend of multiple years, partly so I could smoke obligation-free, and partly because I felt like I was just dragging her down. She has a new boyfriend now, it still hurts and pangs, so that I could be free from judgement and perceived insecurity

My depression and lack of self-worth stems from the fact that I feel like I have not met any of the expectations ever placed on me, my life, for all intents and purposes, has not been particularly difficult or trying. I am 22, about to graduate college this coming spring. My dad passed away from pancreatic cancer when I was 16 and I have ruptured both of my Achilles Tendons on separate occasions (Kobe's injury, for any basketball fans). My dad's death was a struggle, partly because I felt a responsibility to stay alongside my widowed mother (our household income has annually been under $20, but the Achilles injuries may have hurt my personal ideals more, I always look to maintain perspective because these issues are nothing compared to those who are less privileged (let alone warranting of any depression) Since I have quit weed

Yet, I am no longer resigning myself to solely dwelling on the regrets of the past. And as for the future, I am now putting in the work TODAY to quell those anxieties and breed hope and optimism. And most importantly, I am trying my hardest to enjoy the current moment, to be appreciative for all the blessings I have been given. I could not have gained the perspective I needed had I continued to smoke. I guess I felt inclined to make this post because I wanted you guys to see that although there is a definite satisfaction from finally gaining some traction towards the life we want, it can still be a bumpy road. That those of you dealing with depression have to realize that just abstaining, is simply the initial step. If any of you guys are like me, and although it may provide articulate and passionate thoughts, but I am not going to succumb anymore. Stay strong people!",t5_2s9i3

I actually came onto leaves just over a week ago asking for advice on how to moderate my smoking. I had said I wanted to stop smoking as much weed. I said I had stopped for about 10 days and was planning on having a joint on Friday (which was now the Friday before last), and possibly it was, but in my mind I genuinely wanted to do this not to get really high, but to rationally assess what cannabis does to me. So I did it. I rolled a joint and I smoked it. I didn't like it. All my anxieties I had been battling before and during cannabis abstinence were back, and they were INTENSE. Don't get me wrong. Initially I was high. I was laughing out loud at the TV. I was marvelling at my thoughts the way I used to, but then BAM, anxiety. I'm worrying. Ruminating. I can't really control my anxiety. I'm just going round in circles. I should add I'm quite an anxious dude at the best of times, but this was intense. (Since stopping I have experienced pretty extreme anxiety - worse than the general anxiety I experience when smoking weed - Nausea, but nothing REALLY bad or verging on an actual panic attack.)

Anyway, and I became very rational. My only answers were : making me anxious, and making me satisfied with being bored...and then it hit me...this is fucking stupid. For the next 25-30 minutes I pretty much convinced myself that weed just wasn't for me. It's not that I think it's a bad thing, I don't, but I just don't think it agrees with me anymore. I even rolled a one skinned and smoked that just to see if I got worse or better. It just made me sleepy and a little worse. I went to bed and woke up feeling really foggy and tired and in a bit of a 'stone over'. But I felt great. I felt empowered.

Previously when I had quite weed it had always because I felt I should, not because I wanted to stop. But after my reflection I feel as though I have actually made a decision to stop because weed is not right for me. I convoked myself weed is bad for me so now I actually WANT to stop. I'm not really sure if this makes complete sense to everyone, but I guess what I am trying to say is that I feel I combatted my addiction to cannabis by convincing myself it was not good for me (whilst under the influence of it). Before I had convinced myself whilst sober, which meant I knew it wasn't right for me but I still craved it. Now the thought of smoking weed actually makes me feel anxious as opposed to before when the thought of not smoking it did. 

Also, and hit two birds with one stone. It's still pretty rough, but I'm getting there.

I also haven't really been keeping a solid count of how long I have been smoke free. I know that this weekend was my third weekend without smoking

Now I'm not sure my method will work for others

Now I'm not saying this kind of method will work for everyone

Today, far more motivated and far more functional, and even though the withdrawals aren't great, they're receding, and every other aspect of my life has improved.

I've decided to quit.,CatCoveredToes,23,4,7,"Pot is my connection to family - both alive and dead; a way to have fun; a coping mechanism; reward; and what I said was a healthier way of dealing with intense/messed up/insane life experiences growing up.

I came from an interesting mish-mash of family. I have/had two older half brothers who shared the same mother as me but had a different father. I have an older sister who shares the same father but has a different mother. All that being said

I was really close to my older brothers - sadly, my eldest brother committed suicide in jail. 

There was more stuff growing up and I have had off and on times in therapy

Pot was my way to connect to both brothers, does x or y.... but the reality is it's really tied to the family connection. Both brothers smoked. For me, though, the real pot + brother connection was with the younger of the two, M. I took to smoking as a way to think of him, be like him but better, and to be disconnected - which was sometimes the only way we could cope growing up with the pain we had.

He was the first one to get me high

15 years later and the longest break that I've ever taken is a month and that was years ago. Now in most recent years

I know it needs to stop. I have no ill will towards trees. I just need to stop to really move forward with life. I'm finally getting on a fast track towards my goals and am starting to see it as a confusing crutch that I don't need.

I know that the only thing that can truly bring me closer to him is to write him and visit him. Smoking slows the achievement of my goals and makes me tolerate substandard situations/people.

I mean, I smoke less than a gram a week. I've got this under control. I even remember trying to rationalize not flushing it by convincing myself that it might clog the toilet. Defeated by my own high thoughts, I returned to my computer and proceeded to waste the rest of the night. The next morning, I logged onto my computer to find an open text file with three words typed out: ""Give it up.""

So the next morning, open bag in hand, and just stared at the water. Not actually doing anything. It was at that point that I realized just how strong a grip it has on me. I mean, there was only a gram or two left in the bag, and where I come from that's only about $15-20 worth. It would be trivial to replace. But I remember the panic in holding the bag above the toilet. How long am I going to be able to last without it? Am I just going to go buy some more in a few days, or a week, or even a month or more? Should I just try quitting and keeping my stash out of sight? But in the end

When I first started smoking, I decided to try weed and everything changed. I felt no anxiety for the first time, and I was so happy. I used weed as medication for my anxiety for a while. Then after a year or so, I became very depressed. I was not happy with my job, myself or my life. I used weed to escape from reality, very successfully. 

For 3 years I lived alone, but it did work for forgetting about everything. I began taking xanax as a supplement to weed for anxiety. That worked even better for blocking out my problems and postponing my priorities. Whenever I would go anywhere, I would have to smoke and take xanax. My anxiety was worse than ever. 

Within the past year I have stopped taking xanax, and the last obstacle is stopping smoking. I already feel so much better, but I know in order to really get where I want to be I have to stop smoking. I still smoke every night, it is a ritual, and I have to smoke in order to sleep. I have stopped for a week a couple of times, but each time I smoke again, I go right back to the routine. The thing is, and I need to take a long break to reassess for feelings towards marijuana.

So here I am. I found this sub today and I see these people just like me. As with NoFap

Had to express to people they needed to be supportive and not try to bring me back into the party lifestyle. 

I planned out my first three days of the change. I go to therapy and planned to have my third day

Music is absurdly helpful. Drink tons of water also! I switched from coffee to Green Tea because of the anti-oxidents and metabolism. Bananas help me as well. Re-embrace activities you did as a child. You werent born addicted or high and im sure you were a lovely happy child. I swam a lot as a child and thats what I love to do a few times a week as well as daily walks with my headphones

Do some research on withdrawal to a lot of stress is common but theres ways to overcome it.

1341714925.0,w7ecb,Six Months!,Six_Throwaway_Months,22,4,4,"First off


I grew up a lot after I quit. I began to realize that I was wasting my life messing around and getting high with my friends. After quitting, my anxiety eased off because I started drinking more, as well as finding god (a strange mix, I know). Eventually, drinking won out. I stopped going to my church on campus and began to drink heavily through the end of the school year. This lead me to do things I never really pictured myself doing (random sex, showing up to work/class drunk, etc.), mostly because my easy business classes allowed me to blow off schoolwork and still get decent grades.


Now, who works on campus. I haven't seen any of the friends I have left in almost two months. I don't leave my house except for work and school. I brought a few bottles of liquor home from school and drink to fall asleep most nights.


I was in a similar situation last summer, making music, going on adventures or smoking with my girlfriend (at the time). There were times when I got scared, lonely, or depressed, but I felt like I could deal with it and the weed helped.


 I don't really have that now though. I'm really struggling to adjust to life without weed


I'm proud that I made it 6 months without weed, found and lost my faith in god, started having anxiety attacks again, missed out on a chance with a girl I'd liked for months (she smokes, I don't), and got sick 3 separate times (not weed related, but that shit sucked). On the bright side, met a few new friends and have a different outlook on life.


I've made it six months without weed though, and I've had to start from scratch. I wake up most days just wanting to give up; not just weed, but life in general. I don't think I'm going to smoke tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and keep going.


Tl;Dr: No weed changed my life drastically

I prided myself on how functional I was when I was high.  I felt like I could accomplish any task well.  I taught myself to be a web developer

I contemplated quitting for a long time, and would always get more within a day.  Or, if I had to wait, I'd scrape and smoke resin until I could get more.  I knew from previous breaks that the panic would subside within a day or a couple days, but I always gave in.

It became exhausting to keep up that routine.  I felt like a slave to weed in a way

When I reached the end of the sack a month ago, and that added to my motivation.  I haven't had any major cravings really, except a few nights when I've been drunk.  I drink a couple beers when I get home, which provide a similar relaxation that the bowls used to.

The dreams have been intense.  For the most part I'd just stopped dreaming when I smoked, and it feels like I'm battling my demons.

All in all I feel a lot more on point.  I feel like I'll be able to tie up the loose ends in my life and keep my shit straight.  I've smoked once, but I think weed might be different.  I'm hoping I can find a balance with it.  All I can say though, is that after a decade of smoking almost daily, it feels good to be going through life with a clearer head.

Slowly, I would hang out with them as much as I could on the weekends and would pretty much smoke constantly. By the time Sunday night would roll around, I would be a wreck, dreading the coming week.

The weekdays had a weird feeling to them

I refused to smoke alone, I couldn't talk to anyone. I was entirely trapped in my thoughts and felt incredibly lonely in the world. 

Things have gotten better since then, it only causes me to examine myself from a negative perspective and have existential breakdowns. I realized that smoking has become way too big a part of my life and I can't enjoy responsible use anymore.

Yesterday was fairly uneventful. My only real emotional 'trouble' yesterday was when I gave someone advice on /r/ukulele to not give up on their ability to sing, and I was downvoted each time I responded. I didn't understand.

I said this in response:

&gt; When I hear someone being unnecessarily critical of themselves and giving up on something I try to encourage them to not give up. It's just how I am

I got downvoted for that. Can you believe that? It's so upsetting. Apparently ""being nice"" isn't the appropriate reaction to have to someone who is selling themselves short. Even this morning, here's the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukulele//comments/rngyw/playing_fully_instrumental_melody_and_harmony/).) I guess people just assume when someone says ""I'm terrible at something"" you should just let them believe that they are terrible and reinforce that opinion, but I know from experience that anyone can do basically anything as long as you tackle it with the right mindset.

So that only confirmed my belief that reddit is not a very nice place to 'hang out' on the internet, but of course when I woke up there were more negative comments about how I should just shut up or whatever.

Since I've started to feel pretty much normal most of the time---I am regularly drinking water without much trouble; the gnawing feeling in my stomach has finally gone away; any sort of residual high or cloudiness has mostly passed entirely---I've turned my attention to a friend I knew from high school who recently lost his job, depressed about the state he got his life into, smoking tons of weed and trying to distract himself from his depression.

I'm trying to encourage him to quit smoking, and says he has original ideas, but 'meh'. I'm going to try to be a positive influence in his life and see if I can affect some real change, because he's clearly unhappy with the way he is right now. Similar to me, he's started exercising frequently so he's already on the right track, it shouldn't be too hard to nudge him 'toward the light' as it were.

A guy on Twitter is trying to expose me to hip-hop because he's decided that only listening to all the indie rock shit I listen to isn't cool enough. He kept asking me questions and sending me youtube videos of hip-hop songs until he landed on this one: [Language Arts Crew - The Eye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDWN49FDiyo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) which I actually like a lot. So much in fact, I definitely have the vocabulary for it. Something for me to ponder and experiment with. I told my buddy mentioned above that I was thinking about this and he said ""you being a rapper? I have as much of a chance of being President"" to which I said: Dude, there's no reason you couldn't be President, if you tried, and there's no reason I couldn't be a rapper.

I'm a late bloomer when it comes to trees, mediating ADHD…etc. And it delivered; I could fall asleep blissfully, I put an additional 20 pounds on my skinny frame, and I found that during the day I had better focus on my projects at work.


But that wasn't what drove me to quit.


Lately things have been piling up, rationalizing that I had accomplished X amount of work today, and that I was rewarding myself. I resigned myself to the fact that I would smoke almost every day and I tried to control what time I was allowed to smoke as a reward (usually 9:00 pm). But eventually that failed too: I'd come home, make a list of goals and chores to do and reward myself at the end with some trees, but that failed too. I would rationalize why something on my list could be put off to the next day, or the weekend, or later and later and later.


Essentially


I've fallen behind at work, with my family, with my hobbies, with my fitness, and with sleep. I was never a big user either. I'd take maybe one or two hits from my MFLB at the end of the day and play some video games. My original goal of going to sleep at 11:00 pm was compounded by weed and games, and it turned into 12:00 am, 1:00 am and sometimes even 2:00 am. I'd go to work with dark bags under my eyes because of lack of sleep, and I became a hermit. I lost my mental acuity


But I discovered you


So I did a trial run. I quit over spring break and managed 10 straight days without trees. I felt fantastic. I accomplished my weekly goals, I packed everything up, all my toys, my stash, everything. I cleaned my room and I'm working on my house. In fact, I've decided to put in notice to my landlord this month and find somewhere new to live.


I'm starting fresh.


I'm going to step up in almost every aspect of my life. I'm cutting away the fat and giving myself more free time. I'm setting clear goals about how I use that free time, and I'm reaping the rewards. I'm full of energy, excitement and life. Despite being ""sober"" everything seems clearer, more colorful, more intense.


I feel like a beginner again.

It made me remember something a counselor said to me when I was in rehab -- she was an older woman who was an alcoholic

Her point was that it's not enough to say that alcohol/drugs are a way of dealing with stress or relaxing after a hard day.  It's more accurate to say that they are a way of *quickly* dealing with stress or relaxing after a hard day.

Rather than use a natural way to change your emotions

She called it ""playing Napoleon with your emotions"" -- acting like a little general and instructing your feelings on how they should be.  Her opinion was that eventually your feelings react like anything constantly being ordered around.  They rebel and try to screw you back.

I thought it was a neat and useful metaphor.

The first month was certainly the worst. Two weeks in I had terribly bad sleeping problems

About the second month in

I was really hoping I'd be more motivated by now and would be turning more outgoing, and am incredibly unmotivated to do things. I almost feel like I was more motivated when I was smoking because I wanted to go do things during the day, and reward myself with a smoke at the end. I'm not sure if this newfound depression I'm in is because I don't have the drug, or the drug was covering up the fact I'm depressed, or it was actually helping me be less depressed.

Part of the reason I wanted to touch base here was to see if anyone after taking a lot of time off I feel like I'm in even more of a funk and still very unmotivated after quitting smoking. It sounds almost stupid

It's not that I haven't met anyone I like but rather that I haven't met anyone similar to myself. Applying to my school was an afterthought


I don't want to say I'm unhappy, going on bike rides,  smoking, or playing guitar. But I still feel genuinely out of place. Frankly, I feel like I haven't aged at all since August. It's as if everyday is a dream, and that one day I'll wake up and I'll get to start school over. Time passes way to quickly. It's the sort of thing where you'll try to remember what you did yesterday and you won't remember. I'm set on transferring schools at the end of the year but it doesn't really give me any relief. I've had a few awful experiences before and I convinced that it's become a problem again. However I'll put it this way: I've never been more depressed, and life has never been more beautiful. I spend more time now than ever simply thinking about how improbable my life is

Last night I met up with 5 friends from my high school for dinner and coffee. I had smoked about 3 hours earlier and although the depth of my high was in the walk into town to meet them I was still a bit detached from them, except for an occasional comment which they would find humorous. Hearing about all of their crazy college adventures, meeting tons of cool people and going to parties (I can't drink this year because of tuberculosis medication), made me genuinely envious but I didn't really show it. In fact I didn't really show them anything. However I could see how off they thought I was. Even we were hanging out in my dorm room I didn't participate that much in the conversation. At about 9 they left and I must have cried for about half an hour, something I don't do very often, before falling asleep for almost 12 hours.

I honestly have no idea what I think about marijuana. On the one hand, I also feel it only perpetuates my social isolation. I've tried to make it into a social activity but I go to an Ivy league school where very few people smoke and many are super judgmental about smoking and will get mad if you stink up the hallways. Even most of my high school friends have stopped smoking, just because it's not a big scene at their respective schools, and they all now drink a ton.

hanging with Crown Royal just to feel restored

I couldn't help but go Captain Morgan overboard




I'm only 15

so I jump ship to Alice and Wonderland trips

there is where I'd sneer at my fears

back in my own bed

I'm wishing I'd roll over dead

I roll over and roll you instead

I thank you

the only hurt I feel is when I speak

my smile goes for miles



I solemnly swear you're the key but with more feelings to flee

it's no shock I sin out of wedlock

it wasn't 'til the sex on X had me bouncing checks

that I heard a voice tell me to stop

it wasn't loud like an alarm clock

so I minimize my use

to keep you by my side




you lifted me high

together we floated by the bullshit

a bright light in the night making everything alright




then true tragedy and turmoil struck

went on a hunt for a partner stronger than a blunt

still taking puffs but I'm leaving residue on foil

this stuff is rough

I'm not down for the brown




return back to the green

but giggles soon turn to gripes

it doesn't take long 'til I'm switching ice in a bong for ice in a pipe

why introduce me to meth? Are you wishing me death?

just wanted to chill like Cheech and Chong




putting the blame on you is wrong

my infidelity is infinite

I won't go into detail but as I inhale

I'm eye-fucking these lines I'm about to rail

I know this has to end

we can't be lovers and we can't be friends

look at the paths we traveled

it's time for me to mend



I admit it's scary without you

I don't know anything else

but I'm breaking my vows

trying not to reminisce on our last kiss

because you're truly part of my past now

I wasn't exactly fitting in with all the kids at school. All my friends at the time were jocks who only seemed interested in sports and basketball
Bring on the crippling depression. Weed became my escape from reality. I was alone and weed had become my only friend. Always there, after school. I started doodling pot leaves, I began frequenting marijuana forums. I found a few friends (all of whom smoked, none of whom I would spend a great deal of time with.) I didn't need friends. I had withdrawn into my own world. The depression got deeper and darker, but never once would i consider putting down the pipe or stop smoking for any extended period of time. Fuck weed was my only comfort.
Bring on college. Still a stoner, and pale. Depression, insomnia, social anxiety. All I wanted was to be happy, to find a girlfriend, to be comfortable in my own skin. My depression just kept building upon itself. I went to a psych doctor. This shrink pumped me full of drugs most notably adderall. The adderall launched me out of depression and into psychosis. It's tough to find a solid base for reality when you live your life alone in a drugged up dreamland. I was a decent student but the rigors of reality most notably on the social front deemed to much for me and I dropped out before I was to focus on a major.

 Anyways I'm going to give it another go. I need to know what it feels like to be sober again. Hopefully I won't trick myself into using again. I want to progress in my life but for me this addiction is tough to shake.

Flash forward ten years to 23 years old.  That year I got busted with a small amount of weed in my car and plead guilty to a DWI in exchange for the DA dropping the pot charges.  I was on my way to law school and would not have been able to obtain Fed Financial Aid had I been convicted of a drug crime.  The DA felt bad and gave me a ""break"".  Now for most people this would be the moment where they realize that getting stoned is not worth jeopardizing their future.  But not me.

 Something's been on my mind quite a bit today, reward system for myself outside getting high. I've worked 8 days in a row, and it's really hitting me how strange it feels to not tell myself ""you really plugged through that, now you've earned a few bowls!"" Ordinarily after doing something unpleasant getting high's the reward, or it's how I ""prepare"" myself to do the unpleasant thing to begin with. Almost everything I use to reward myself or relax I've associated with being high. Get high and write. Get high and play video games. Get high and embroider. Get high and go camping. I think it's going to be quite a process to disentangle leisure activities from being high, but I can see how it's possible. But what about simple ordinary self-care? What do y'all do to reward yourselves? I'm thinking a long bath and a good book for tonight, but I think a big part of this for me is going to be discovering multiple sources of self-care, I mean

yesterday's post:

Just wanted to talk to some people going through the same experience as I am. I'm a 14-year smoker, I imagine because she didn't want me to feel resentful or ""make"" me quit. I told her that I've known for a long time it's pretty problematic and escapist, and one of the ways I've always rationalized it to myself is that nobody's ever told me it's a problem, and if someone I cared about ever asked me to quit, I would. I acknowledged that I was feeling pretty terrified, but told her that wasn't a reason I SHOULDN'T do it, but another indicator that I've got a pretty unhealthy relationship with it. So I'm resolved to do this, too, so I was looking for someone else. I was doing just fine without it thinking it would be back eventually, completely unlike my internal image of myself.

Usually I'll wake up at around 6:30 am

What's going on with me? Well, and over this past weekend something about that fact really struck me. I don't know why it struck me, or why it hit me now, but it did, hard. I suddenly felt like I was plateauing, stagnating, become a certain kind of mediocre that I've never been before. I'm not who I used to be, actually it's a good thing. I'm all sorts of mature and super-wise and such now. The problem is that I felt like I'm not living up to myself. I'm not living up to the potential I've certainly displayed in the past

I took a good look at myself and realized that if I'm going to be able to build on the moderate success I've already accomplished

I went to bed an hour early last night, under-stimulated. Then I woke up 2 hours early this morning, 4:30 am, though I didn't get out of bed until regular time. I figure these things are caused by the change of routine and smoke-habit. Cool, changes accepted. 

Guess what? I've signed myself up for some free online courses through Coursera.org! I'm super-excited about it. This morning I started participating in a course on informal logic offered by Duke university and though I'm not exactly a super-genius, for from now on until June of next year! I've spent the morning so far listening to lectures while I paint, stopping to do the exercises and take the quizzes. This is how I'm going to spend my days off from now on, and I feel really frickin good about that.

Before they confronted me about that though, I am looked up to by pretty much everyone else as a role model. I came to this group under a year ago, during my senior year, and already I've established such a secure and trusted bond with nearly every other kid. I will be graduating high school as soon as I finish my second senior year within the month. After that I will be allowed to attend youth group sessions only until the end of the semester. When I shared this last bit with the group last night (before I got high) there were reactions of devastation from other group members. I'm including this part of the story to help illustrate how much I mean to the rest of my group, and therefore how important it was that I set a good example.

Before I was taken home by the adult leader, and I reassured them I would attend sessions in the future. I did not tell them what I did that got me kicked out of camp.

I got home and torched a bowl. Almost immediately I was plagued with feelings of shame and remorse. To see the looks on their faces when I told them I did something wrong, but for YEARS I've been making excuses for everything to the people in my life and to myself. I'll twist my mind until I've justified my mistakes with weak, sorry excuses just to avoid facing the fact that I fucked up. I'm sick of living this way. It's time to get over myself.

   I would guess that it’s been 6 years, no, more than that. She’s the comforting arm when I come home. She puts me to bed, and often wakes me up. Not 3 months ago, I was sure I would smoke until the day I died, I was resigned to it, I had convinced myself that I was so broken and the only way to survive was to stay numb, to shield myself. I was content with that.
 

   Shortly after this realization, I told myself it was time for a break “I don’t know what kind of trouble I’m in, i should stay clean until I’m out of the woods.” “I just lost all that money to a lawyer, it would be irresponsible to buy more weed!” I had so many good reasons. Over the last few months, I’ve taken about 3 breaks, each last between 6-13 days, which always ended in me throwing caution to the wind and picking up where I left off. Finally I got the good news that I had dodge any real legal trouble, I felt…. Defeated. I wasn’t able to stop for even a month! I slowly started realizing how much of my life was defined by pot.

Plays in a band, takes risks, I have been. Weed has  been a short leash, and realized that if fappin was fucking up my head this much

   
   I see now that since I can remember, sucking my environment dry to get my kicks. I want more, I’ve always wanted more, but I’ve been paralyzed. So I’m taking a step, I don’t know if it’s the right one, and I’m scared shitless.  But action is never easy, and it’s time for a change

   
   So I’m sitting here heartbroken for giving it up, and there are many obstacles, but I have to reach for something or my life is going to pass me by. 

   
   I wrote out some goals today, the irony was not lost on me. My goal then is September 1st. I don’t know what will happen after, but I know I have to get there; I have to prove to myself that I can preserver.

I've tried quitting several times in the last few months, and smoked to reward myself. Bad idea. The fog instantly came back over me, and I fell back into my old ways. Smoking all day. Every day.

Last week, and couldn't see the harm in smoking a blunt with my friend and seeing Prometheus. I spend $80 on weed the following three days, smoking myself into oblivion.

Now I'm five days in once again. These last five days haven't been that difficult, and have certainly been productive. I've thought about weed, but it hasn't been an overwhelming urge. Just a thought. 

But now it's friday

But I know better this time. THC is still in my mind

Just as a word of advice to everyone on here... PLEASE be careful. You WILL think at some point that it will be no big deal to smoke. It always seems realistic, just like I have way too many times. 

I've learned

Five days in. My brain knows something is wrong. There isn't enough THC in my system. And I'm starting to get ancy. I REALLY want to smoke now. It's hard to concentrate. But I will persevere. I have to

And remember, which is why you're trying to pull yourself out. This alone is enough to provide you with a gung-ho attitude for a while, that makes quitting not seem all that hard. Just remember that this is only the beginning of the race. You need to keep it up. Don't let your mind play tricks on you. Don't allow yourself to be convinced that weed isn't a big deal, or that you can smoke ""just this once"". It is OBVIOUSLY a big deal or you wouldn't have quit in the first place.

1334284507.0,s7b0o,Day 18 - a.k.a. the first day I've been happy all day,,18,2,6,"Not sure how it happened, but I pulled myself out of that pretty quickly. Aside from that I've been consistently happy all day.

Work went pretty well. Last week I spoke to my supervisor about giving me more hours/more duties and he said nothing was guaranteed and that if I needed to go find more work then I should look out for myself and do that. Of course, and that I've been a great help in ""straightening out some people"" (remember the racism thing, the guy who threatened me, plus I helped stop this girl from having a bunch of attitude at everyone) and offered me an additional job (to the tune of a mere extra 6 hours a week to add to my existing 12, but still) that I have been wanting. I kind of groaned at him: right after you told me to look for other work! But he told me that I had a week to decide whether I wanted the job or not, and that he'd hold onto it for me until then. I figured I wasn't going to be able to take it, but after the orientation at the temp agency---which seems kind of ghetto and the other 5 people who were there with me were approximately 10% as smart as I am, but I am clearly severely overqualified for the kind of work they are staffing people for--I think I am now.

My stoner buddy, or taking yet another job that is far below my qualifications, I realized that now that I'm not smoking pot I have no reason to act like an anti-social douche who doesn't want to work with his friend at his friend's company (who I am already programming for on the side anyway) and it seems like it may be a sure thing that I can go work with him, and still work at my current job since I like the people so much... I'll just have to have them adjust my schedule a bit. The idea of working from 4am to 5pm seems scary, since I've always been a lazy ass, but on the other hand maybe it'll be good for me...

I guess my buddy didn't understand what I've been going through. I told him today was the first day that I didn't really feel like I want to die for any part of it, that it was the truth. And that when I would panic when I would run out of marijuana, it wasn't just me exaggerating a minor annoyance, I would actually be panicking. I guess I just never told him how severe my emotional problems really are. He said he had no idea, and he can't imagine feeling that way. In truth, it's weird for me to think that most people *don't* feel like crawling into a dark corner and dying on a daily basis. It's always been a part of my life experience, the wishing it would all just fucking end

The woman I mentioned in other posts, and we seem to be on the same page: we don't want to get totally serious, but we enjoy each other's company and might as well enjoy each other until we can't anymore. I'm kind of thrilled. I just like to be around her, and I'm not in any danger of falling madly in love with her and going crazy when she eventually leaves whenever that may be. Sure, I feel kind of like I would totally marry her and put babies in her, but I know that's not an option---she is such an independent spirit and that is part of what makes her so alluring. Anyway.

In the end... I've been happy all day. I haven't let my parents get me down. The idea of working full time at a nice job again is the light at the end of the tunnel: I'll be able to move out, even if it's only temporary---temporary is probably what I need right now.

It's kind of... amazing. Today has been amazing. Oh! And I learned another song on my ukulele

Yesterday i smoked all i had left and now we play the waiting game. Weed became an everyday occurance. It was really getting in the way of my life. I was even wake-n-bakin before i went to school or my job. The time has come to stop. 


edit: After feeling the support and finally actually reading other peoples stories I decided to open up a bit and get real as well. I really love this sub-reddit. 

I have always gotten by pretty decently with weed, I was doing alright.

It took a close brush up with the law to really help me understand that weed is still ILLEGAL. I was on my roof

When we went back downstairs to our apartment

They tried to play good cop bad cop to get me to admit that I was stoned at the time but I saw right through it. Sorry, is my friend. Also, I pulled out my iphone, turned on the video camera and put it back in my pocket. Just trying to protect myself :)

Soon after, they were going to write us up. 

My roommate did not have his ID on him. The cop told my roommate to go into the apartment and get his ID. When my roommate went in one of them tried to gain access (walk in) into my apartment. I immediately asked him what he was doing and why he felt the need or had the right to enter my apartment. To my surprise he apologized but then he gave a BS excuse that he was concerned that my roommate was getting a weapon. I asked him if he was serious and if we looked or acted hostile in anyway. He said no and shut the door. 

Then we got our court summons but they fucked up. They wrote that we had to appear in court by 2/1/11 and not 2/1/12. I can't go back in time?! So hopefully we'll get the whole thing thrown out. If it does go to court I will plead guilty to trespassing but will argue that the roof door has no posted signs that say we are not allowed to go on the roof. Also

The point is that it was too close. If I didn't immediately deny everything they would have asked to search me and I would have been fucked. If I didn't speak up right away about the officer entering my apartment I would have been fucked (shit was on the table). Thank god all i got was a summons for trespassing that they fucked up on.

The recap of the time I have been sober.
********************
It is roughly Day 38.  I have not smoked anything in this time.  It has been a roller coaster.  It took me about two weeks before I was feeling up to eating real meals again.  I avoided the problems caused by that by making sure I was taking a daily vitamin as well as a meal supplement in the morning and attempting to eat fruits/veggies throughout the day.  The being able to sleep came back within a couple of days of quitting.  To help that I started working out as hard as I could.  I am talking 1hr+ work outs in my room (Sit-ups, lifting whatever heavy shit I had lying around).  I have stopped working out for the most part.  I have lost interest in a lot of the things I used to like.  Video games are boring, skating is just a pain in the ass, I don't draw or do my stupid freestyle anymore.   I have been happy, and I have been sad.  My emotions are everywhere.  But hey if I can do it, I know everyone that is thinking about it can.  Believe in yourself.  Know that every time you say no you are stronger.  Be yourself, and if there is anyone of your 'friends' that don't like you cause you cleaned up.  Two words.  FUCK 'EM.  Drop those chumps.  If they are good friends they will understand you need your space and will be more than willing to get back together once you get your act sorted.    


********************

TLDR: Below is just a rant it doesn't have to be read.  This summarizes it quite well.  I am not happy after quitting for a month.  Quite the opposite, and I do, I just see all the ill will that this world brings forth.  

**************************************

It has been a little over a month since I quit.  After months of saying 'Oh I will quit, I got tired of the failing grades, I got tired of it all.  Missing friends, bailing on family, spending money out the ass.  I got tired of using it as a crutch for my fucked up head.  I wanted peace, weed used to do that but no more, so I stopped just clean and clear.  And honestly the first week or so was GREAT.  I loved it being clean being in control of my self, the depression

But I am not happy.  I am not happy at all.  This isn't a oh I am not happy today. I haven't been happy for fucking weeks.  I knew that quitting wouldn't end any of the shit I am dealing with.  I knew that.  But I thought it would at least provide me a mental clarity that would help me find happiness.  All I have found is how much I dislike this place I am living in, I got my friends and my family.  But still.  What the hell is wrong with this world.  We preach peace and love and understanding while holding a gun to every ones head.  'Follow the rules, it will keep you safe. Look out for your fellow brother/sister.'  only to be yelled at and threatened when you do exactly that.  I mean ffs, I tried to help this kid who was pickpocket only to have the dad want to beat my face in because he assumed I was the one who did it.  Please think about that.  I am going to pickpocket you and then walk up and tell you that I just did that, yeah makes PERFECT sense.  That hurt me a lot.  I know I am what some consider sketchy but damn...do I look that bad?  Do I act that fucked up!?

Makes me wish I never quit.  At least then I could live in ignorant bliss.  But I won't smoke again FUCK THAT NOISE. Sure I get cravings every now and then, and block out all this shit.  I don't want it though, I really don't.  I want to face everything head on. 

But I honestly thought I would be happy.  Instead I am constantly putting on a fake smile, I appreciate everything they do!  I really do.  It's a small moment of light knowing there are some out there willing to help.  I have tried talking to my school therapists but all they ever want to do is medicate me.  Give me sleeping meds and shit.  I hate meds, I already take them for ADD and I see the huge difference it makes in me. Why the fuck would I want meds that would keep me asleep or 'mellow' me out.  If I wanted that I would just go rip a god damn bong.  At least that works.  One person who helps though is my own personal therapist and that has cost me more money then I have.  I am constantly broke. 
It is like nothing has changed.
All the same crap
Instead of being high and ignoring my friends
Instead of spending my money on weed it is spent on doctors and fucking school projects.
Instead of being blissfully unaware
Instead of feeling like the bare minimum is good enough
Instead of blah blah blah fucking blah.  I constantly feel like I am bitching, ""Look around you.  You got a computer, and a good school, and a car, and family, and friends.  Why are you complaining?""  Because none of it makes me fucking happy.  I say I want to go home, but I don't even have a home.  My own mom thinks I am kidding when I tell her I have PTSD

So far on day 4 my dreams are crazyyy, my focus is a lot better with my mind feeling less cloudy, my energy is slowly increasing everyday (most important to me), I'm loving the clear sober feel unlike day 1-2, and lastly I feel happier.

But back to the title

Making a list to me is the best way to remind myself AND if my brain starts trying to trick myself into smoking and somehow making me forget why I'm quitting

A few other tips that personally helped me are giving every pipe + paraphernalia away to your stoner buddies

Another one is stopping on a Thursday or Friday. To me the weekend is the best time to handle the withdrawals. You can go out and distract yourself. You don't have to sit at work and handle the withdrawals + think about how sweet being high would be. Personally
I also used half a melatonin pill each night to help ko myself.
One downside to the weekend strategy is you might be at a party with weed

The hardest day for me was day -1 and day 0 and truly committing. Once I honestly 10000% wanted to stop

If you start thinking about weed smack yourself for Pavlov negative reinforcement

If anything

You guys can ask me anything if you want! You won't regret quitting :) good luck

No more getting stoned

You can't handle it.  No amount of rationalization can change that.

You are uncomfortable because you smoked too much.

You couldn't rest until it was gone.

It is for this reason alone that it will only hinder performance in life and bring you nothing but heartache.

-Your Past Self.

Now.  Allow me to preface this series of events that lead to the re-confirmation of my addiction.  September 10

Between day 6-11 of sobriety I was having massive amounts of depression, I love addiction. Don't you?)  It was a struggle from a monetary standpoint to throw out an MFLB and even *gasp* weed but it was the smartest decision I felt that I had made in a while.  My mental and physical health were worth more than any sum of money and that was that.

Friday:  Four months and eight days sober and it brings us to Friday night.  It's my girlfriends birthday weekend.  She has been eating a Ketogenic diet and decided that Friday was a cheat day after losing 10 lbs.  We went down to Marble Slab and I treated us to an XL ice cream each.  As soon as we pulled into our parking stall at home she says ""It's too bad that...Never mind.""  

Me-""I know exactly what you were going to say.  Do you think that's a good idea?""

Her-""I don't know.  I've really been craving it lately. How do you feel about it?""

Me-""Well I can honestly say I haven't craved it in 2 and a half months.  I think that it would be fine this once.""

And the hunt began.  I drove up to my brother to meet him at a friends house 40 minutes away on the other side of the city just to buy a 5 bag.  I had a nagging at the back of my head telling me that I would regret it but I ignored it.  

I got home and asked her to prepare a bowl.  I had one hoot

Saturday:  I woke up with a weed hangover.  The type you get where you can't wake up.  Your eyes are still dry.  You can't shake the fogginess in your head no matter how hard you try.  You have heartburn from eating a mountain of food the night before.  You all know what I'm talking about.  At this point I still had weed left(about 0.3)and I had this plan that I was going to bring it back to my brother but I didn't really have the motivation to leave the house for some reason.  As the day wore on my mind went from 'This needs to be gotten rid of. I'm never smoking again.' to 'This needs to be gotten rid of.  I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to smoke again.  I miss joints.  I should roll a joint.  I'll wait for the perfect moment to bring it up to my girlfriend.'

I brought it up that we should roll a joint and go for a walk so it's gone

I am

Update: I just flushed the roach after my girlfriend came out and asked what happened to it.  I thought about just flushing the toilet and faking it but I didn't.  It's swimming with the poopies now.

Tl;dr:  Don't challenge your addiction and think that it's just a matter of time before you're cured.  It will always be there.  It's your choice whether you want to be a smoker.

Congratulations, but these resemble the things which I have seen in myself and in those close to me. We all had our first high, our first time ripped, our first time alone, our first joint, our first bong rip, our first vape hit. Some even went on to break the ice with large purchases, first robberies


Don’t get me wrong, roll blunts and jays, pack and corner bowls, and get twisted. I think it should be legalized and regulated as it is certainly far less destructive than alcohol and cigarettes. It’s 1:39 AM and in my 15.5 waking hours today I have thought about getting high almost 50 times, yet I haven’t seen,  smelled, or used weed in over FOUR months. Each of my 124 days sober has involved some mental contact with this wonderful plant. Yet I don’t even remember the last time I smoked it. Before the end I smoked marijuana for a total of almost two years, a short period of monthly use, 2011.


I bent down on the floor over a bucket half-filled with water. I wasn’t heaving up my dinner, suction filled the expanding chamber with smoke. When lifted to the fringes of being sealed, the top was unscrewed and replaced by a mouth. The owner of the mouth simultaneously sucked in and pushed down on the bottle, forcing thick smoke deep into his lungs. That’s how my friends had done it. It was my turn, and as a newbie, it was important for me to be careful not to mess up and lose this valuable smoke.


I managed to clear the chamber and felt the smoke tickling at my lungs. It tasted surprisingly good in my mouth, almost right. I had never smoked a cigarette or even taken a pull of alcohol in my life. I was a senior in high school, already admitted and committed to the college of my dreams, and I had decided that trying pot with some respectable and intelligent friends of mine would be a good idea to help avoid any surprises at school. Or something like that. There isn’t actually any one solid reason I would have given at the time for why I had the sudden change of heart to get intoxicated. Perhaps a deep underlying curiosity could be realized now that I knew that people I respected and admired smoked pot. They were responsible about it and it didn’t seem to outwardly affect their lives in any way at all. So I picked up this new hobby of smoking weed on the weekends. I got out of the house way more than I used to and somehow I was more connected to the world around me than ever before.
The morning of December 8, acted young and unashamed with friends, and consumed food from a different universe. The problem was that I had never actually made a plan for my usage and experimentation. I had only thought as far as “smoke pot this Friday” instead of “why am I doing this and how and when can I achieve that goal?” I began to reconcile with this question on Saturday morning, setting up barriers to future use. I would only smoke with other people, I would never buy it, I wouldn’t tell my parents, I wouldn’t do it alone
As I got more and more immersed into this thriving subculture, one needed to bring his own bag. I bought my first from one of those respectable, responsible, and smart gents who got me into it all. But even he showed signs of being out of control with his new dealing self. He even cautioned that dealing was a bad idea, a unique warning in a culture enchanted by the positive effects of pot.


I can’t stress enough that you need to be absolutely self-aware in order to make the decision to smoke weed. You need to make yourself as conscious as possible about the consequences and rewards of your actions, let’s take a break” there is much higher potential for abuse. Use of cannabis can be a part of a thriving dynamic life, but abuse and silence can lead to intense and discomforting experiences surrounding marijuana. 


Speaking of thriving with weed, I altered the method of my experimentation. One of the most profound of these alterations, later on in my use, was the multi-day binge. I would get high upon waking, and try to maintain that high throughout the day. This was markedly different than my parties-only weekend smokes from before. I was delighted at my perceived ability to continue to excel at things even while really stoned. I realized later that it actually made me worse at things I wasn’t good at. I’m not trying to scare you away from smoking pot. I’ll still recommend that people try it and use it, but I want people to go in with the tools to enjoy marijuana and not allow it to detract from their lives through abuse.


Dealing drugs was the absolute epitome of a drastic identity shift which was the result of my abuse of the ganja. With my amorphous self limits and rules, but I did not want to stop smoking. It was college, after all. I started making firecrackers with my ABV. Business was working out, but people didn’t always want firecrackers and I didn’t always want to make them. I felt like I had to though, I might not be able to take this cash off their hands later on. With this inconsistency between what people wanted and what I wanted, I felt out of control. Instead of stopping everything and assessing where I had taken myself, I pressed ever onward. I started dealing mushrooms because I wasn’t interested in using them frequently. I had a connect and needed cash for bud, but the ‘shrooms ran out and so did my control over my situation. I was tired of paying for weed


I made a ton of money legally in the summer of 2012. I thought I should invest some of it and front someone, on a run to pick up a half pound, I was robbed of every dollar I had coagulated. The gun flashed in the driver side window, with a long black knife not far away. Phones, cash, a tire, all gone. I was stranded, and thought there was a good chance of an investigation. This was a smack in the face. I had messed up big time. By sheer luck I faced no negative legal or health consequences for my actions. My plea to you is to be very clear with yourself. Dealing drugs is absolutely and thoroughly bad. Sure


Legalize. Moderate. Use, sure that’s fine. Just don’t lose sight of who you were, who you are, and who you want to be. And tighten up that joint while you’re at it, no one likes a canoe.

New Years Eve we had our last smoke. This is also one step in my mind to saving our relationship. I found out last night that she's been smoking with our roommate pretty regularly. In reality she said only twice. But I know she's lying. She's told me that the only friends of hers that are successful in truly quitting had to change their people, but it felt like she lied to me. I've not been so disappointed. I feel like the support and this thing we would tackle together has been ripped away. I was depressed before about our relationship, and now I feel it's doomed. 

I didn't think I'd need this group as much as I do right now. I'm afraid of who this journey is going to take away from me. I don't think she realizes how serious I am when I say that when the lease is up I'm going to be changing my people and places drastically.

It's really long, and become more prone to give in to your addiction. But also, the inhibition wears down your mind so that your brain can't devote as much attention to other things either (like life in general). 

An example of this would be seeing a pipe, staying away from things that remind you of your addiction is very important. So leaving the house where you know your weed is watching you and joining a rock-climbing group will distract you which means it won't exhaust you and break down your resistance into smoking.

Personal example: Last night, I would have said no. After we were done talking, he went in his room to smoke a bit. I asked him if I could take a hit. He said it was just resin so I said never mind. I'm happy I didn't smoke. But I realize that if anything marijuana-related dances around in my head, I'll be more likely to give in than if it was out of the blue offered to me.

At first I tapered off, ending in a week between sessions, I figured I could buy some and be a casual smoker. Only every now and then with friends, for movies, blah blah blah. So I relapsed and that lasted for about 3 months. I was right back to waking and baking, and high all day from then on.

I threw out all my stuff: six bowls, and a guitar pick with some kief stuck to it.  I did it right after I smoked my last bowl (with kief, it was awesome).  But as I burnt I found myself drifting off thinking about how happy I used to be and how happy everyone on here seems after they stop.  I had to think really really hard to what I used to be like four years ago and it nearly brought me to tears.  After I threw my stuff out back I went out front and smoked a cig and I finally felt like there was hope for me to stop this time.  Maybe being high and making the decision to throw my paraphernalia away wasn't the best decision but the trash comes tomorrow morning before I wake up so the tiny, non-tree obsessed, rational side of leavin yelled at the top of his tiny lungs and I did it.  

Sorry for the long winded post but this is the first time in a very long time that I have talked about the way I feel.  Much love r/leaves,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,t3_11oang

It's not been easy - one way or another I would always justify why it's fine for me to keep smoking, ""I don't spend much money on other things"", ""it takes the edge off when I come home from a hard day at work"", ""it's better than drinking every night"", ""I've managed to build a successful life over the last 13 years, so it's obviously ok""...

I'm not saying, in my head, the negatives balance out or outweigh the positives.

I've been struggling a lot in life over the last year, with work, and at points even with friends, family, and other relationships.  Now, granted, marijuana has not, been part of the problem, and did not want to end up living a life that does not amount to much of anything. So I decided to make a change.

Since high school I had mildly contemplated a military lifestyle for myself but as I neared graduation I stopped giving two shits and just wanted to live life and have fun. Fast forward four years to now, and was given the opportunity to take any job I wanted in the military (Evidently I scored well enough that doors that weren't open could be opened for me). I got those results back the week before Christmas. That night I smoked with friends, we piled all our kief together, and I still had most of an ounce of shwag. We rolled a bunch of joints, made a kief puck, smoked the ever loving shit out of everything. I gave away all the green I had left, my grinder, pipe

I pissed clean on my home drug test today, had experiences I never would have dreamed of, went places, saw and did things, met people that I never would have done without it. 99% of those were all good, too.

But marijuana will now become that ex that you deeply loved but just have to walk away from because you need to go a different direction in life. I loved her, and maybe one day I can take her back in my arms and love her again. But for now, it's time to be responsible and make something of my life; and I can't do that with her.

I noted that after I had used the synthetic and before anything else that night that it was an okay high, pretty mellow but short-lived, nothing special.  I was only a social user at parties and small get-togethers, but after that night I stayed away from marijuana and synthetics, because I was going to school for criminal justice and wanted to get a job in the field (law-enforcement officer).

In summer 2010, $20 here, $20 there.  I was generally responsible with my usage - I would only use after work or a few hours before work (food-service industry) so I'd be sober, and I wouldn't carry it with me in my car.  (I'd like to say that I tried not to drive high, but that was only true for about a week.)  My use was probably 1.5g a week.

In late 2010, coupled with my synthetic use, and this drove it deeper.  I continued to use synthetics but since I was unemployed, my use went up.  Not quite to the addiction phase, but maybe 2-3g a week.

Around early 2011, seriously, it was ridiculously cheap.  This was also the period that I noticed that I had to ""redose"" constantly due to the short-lived effects of synthetics.

At this point, and I didn't feel withdrawals or anything.  Of course, the first thing I did when I got back was hit the bong, so your judgment may vary.

This went on until May 2011.  While concocting my own batches, so I tried some of that.  On my first use, I had a major panic attack in which I started contemplating my eternal soul and the fact that I was a complete and utter waste of a husk of a human.  I tried to calm myself down by sitting in front of a mirror and saying ""It's just a chemical, it will pass, it will only take time"".  I eventually called my brother (who knew nothing of what was going on with me) and told him I was having a bad trip and needed him to come get me.  By the time he and his wife came over (at 1 am), the effects had worn off, but during my panic attack I took all of the chemicals and batches I had and thrown them away.

After that, I decided once again to start using synthetics.  Of course I remembered my bad trip, but I rationalized it as best as I could.  This time I didn't purchase packs or research chemicals online and instead turned to head shops.  About once a week I would go for a long drive, stop at a head shop, buy a couple week's worth of synthetics ($150), and go home.

In April 2012, however, I would keep it in my car and immediately dose on my 40 minute drive home.

In late July, and I felt a little bit of withdrawal (irritability, ""butterflies"" in my stomach), but it wasn't as bad as I expected.  I was sober for another 3 months.  It was also around this time that I got promoted to a different post for my job, so I figured it was probably a good idea to make sure my mind was clear as it was a supervisor position.

In November 2012, and this is where I really started to feel the effects of addiction.  I would order one pack and it would satiate my need.  I would try another one and if it turned out to be crap (eg it didn't have any synthetic chemicals that worked for me), I would start to feel heavy withdrawals while waiting for the next shipment.  Again, I would be irritable, get butterflies in my stomach, dry-heave, and sleeping was very difficult.  Once I got a batch that worked for me

In January of this year, I could place an order on Wednesday morning and have the product in my mailbox when I got off work on Friday.  Again, I noticed a problem when I would have heavy withdrawal symptoms if I ran out early or the shipment was late.

During this time, and I would be hitting the pipe as I was pulling into the parking lot at 5:55.  It was easy to get away with it because I would just sit in my office for an hour and read the news while the effects wore off.  As I mentioned, I worked security, and there was almost nothing to do.

I quit my job in April because it was an absolute clusterfuck and I found out that I hate being bored out of my mind at work.

On Memorial Day of this year, I called my brother and told him that I needed someone to talk to.  When I got to my parents', I told them that I wanted to sell my house and move back in with them because I was tired of being alone.  I didn't mention to either of them that I had a problem with synthetics, but I don't think that matters - I think what matters most is that I haven't used anything since that day.

It took some time to get used to

My addiction seems to be under control, I'll just try to remember how terrible it felt when I would run out of product and how pissed I'd be that I'd have to go a weekend without anything, and how I never want to have to feel that way again.  Now I just need to deal with my depression, deal with getting my house sold, and deal with getting a new job.",,False,t5_2s9i3,True

I'll start from the beginning which was about 3-4 (i don't quite remember) years ago in grade 11. One of my best friends knew I was interested in trying pot, we got married right after highschool. We started smoking together, daily. This was fun for the first few weeks until it started just masking problems her and I were having, never actually fixing them, just getting angry, smoking a bowl or two and forgetting about it, repeat next day. So that went on for about a year until she ended up cheating on me with 1. A guy online who she (never met) ""Fell in love"" with and broke up with a week later 2. My ex best friend (Not the one who introduced me to weed).

So after that year of daily weed smoking and a horrible relationship, that is legal. I abused this stuff pretty hard for the next 6-8 months only going 2-4 days max without taking a little bit. Picked up drinking and cigarettes while I was at it too. It took me until Jan 2013 to quit Methylone and Drinking, and until about april 2013 to quit cigarettes. Yet through all of those substances, weed has stayed, all day every day. Its the only substance I feel I can't give up. So now its July 2013 a year after my break up, and I wanna get on my feet, go to school, get my motivation back

 I believe I'm over my ex and that whole situation (I had therapy for that many months ago), if I don't quit smoking I see myself homeless within a year, and without friends.

Dear __

You tried pot for the first time in Grade 11. You smoked more at school, and daily turned into several times a day- a lot of the times alone. The only thing you wanted to do was be high, be high at the gym, be high doing art, be high doing math, be high around him. 

Weed numbs your emotions, and after you figured out it was unhealthy it allowed you to stay in it for much longer than you should have been. Being high allowed you to compromise your mind, your emotions, and your body to your ex-boyfriend and kept you there. You knew he will filling your baggie up, even if he did it when you were gone and even if he didn't tell you. You knew that not wanting to be around him sober was a problem. You knew that being high stopped you from looking around at the mess you were in. You kept making excuses, and you knew, deep down, but you kept making excuses. As much as people are telling you what happened 'is not your fault'

The last two years of your life have been a wreck. I know it's not just because of smoking

But I pose the question

Remember who you were before all of this started? Remember what you used to get accomplished? People are telling you are depressed

Today you have to stop. Today is the first day of a new era

Good luck

1368612420.0,1edhyn,25 days and starting to feel frustrated,lordmvt,17,1,26,"I just found r/leaves today

I made the decision to quit smoking 25 days ago.  I have been smoking quite a bit for around 5 years.  Someday 3 joints and day

I decided to quit because it was getting back to the state I always hated, having some drinks, having fun, but wanted to smoke.  Ended up leaving the party, just to find my friend and burn one.  I realised how many times I had done this.  Leaving entertaining events, just because I wanted to smoke.  How often I had said I was going to cut down or quit, only to slowly start up again.  Just once a week became every other day, became buying a quarter

Smoking friends told me now to worry so much, weed is non-addictive so there’s no issue, and all the other reasons smokers give.

But I know the truth, it became the only thing I wanted to do.  If I was drinking the way I smoke, where I couldn't have alcohol in the house without drinking it, where I was going out of my way to have a drink.  Couldn't concentrate if I knew I could have a drink after work, then I’d be an alcoholic.

Mainly I’ve been okay.  The first few days were difficult

But the last 2 days, less anxious, happier.  But I’ve been feeling the opposite.  I have zero motivation to do anything.  Nothing is interesting me, enthralling me, I can’t concentrate on anything.  I’ve not felt like going out since quitting, not in a ‘if I can’t smoke there’s no point’, I just plain did not feel like it.  And I’ve felt incredibly low.  I’ve felt more tired each morning.  I didn’t smoke before sleeping (I realised a long time ago that weed did nothing for my sleeping patterns

Right now
For ages that was always my issue.  I wanted to quit.  But only when I smoked.  Until I got high

I hope I carry on.  I don’t want to smoke

So I'm now going on 4 days without smoking after a month or two of indulgence. I've had to quit before after getting tested a work, but after my birthday and 420 (same weekend), I promised myself I'd detox. But fuuuuuuck this was not a good one.

I've seen some postings here from people who get the shakes or DT, so I had work to distract me and a routine that would ensure I still ate and took care of myself.

Not this weekend. I felt like shit. No motivation and no appetite, but a factor). To top it off I went to my folks house and misinterpreted something my Dad said as a dig at me and was sick last night over the emotional fallout from it. I wanted a smoke so bad, and it didn't help the temptation when I found a small stash my mom left out (Side-note, she was just diagnosed with cancer again and we know from experience smoking helps her mood, her pain, and her appetite.) 

Thankfully I didn't, and I have to say this detox experience was so bad I don't want to start smoking again in case I need to get clean again. it sucks and it's just not worth the moment of pleasure pot gives you.

Since my school semester was about to end when I decided to stop smoking, I think I've been able to abstain from smoking mostly because of the advice given in this subreddit and because I've been spending my vacation back at home with my parents. 

Back home I rarely go out, it has been a LITTLE bit easier just because I haven't really been tempted nor have I had it easily accessible to me. I feel as if being back home has brought me to a safe haven where I am disconnected with my old habits of meeting with my friends and smoking. Though I admit that I have relapsed twice since I decided to quit I felt awful afterwards and continued to remain clean after my moments of weakness.

I'm an 11 year pot smoker who recently has gone from a Q/O a week habit down to less than an eighth and I see myself continuing to lessen. 

I have kept this schedule up for 2 weeks and am entering my 3rd week. I never thought it would be possible to reduce the amount I smoke

I am one of the ""rare"" or at least uncommon individuals that feel intense withdrawals from pot

I decided that I had to do something different, even though I know smoking = bad for my lungs, I couldn't stop it, so I went with smoke less &gt; smoking more. The least of all evils, would this decision pay off? ..... YES!

So each day the goal is simply to not smoke more than the previous day

I've learned a few ground rules:

-----------------
My willpower dramatically lessens after that first toke

Cognitive Behavior Therapy to deal with the mental shit that comes up while you have perpetual transient withdrawals during the tapering. 

Enough product to allow you to consistently use without interrupting your tapering routine.

Use Pavlovian conditioning to program myself when it's ok to smoke, same room, same time or a little later).

-----------------

The first day I made it to 11:00. I repeated this a few times, ... and now I'm up to 4:20 pm. 

So I wake up around 8:00 am and can delay my first toke to 4:20is pm. This is unheard of for me

The cognitive behavior therapy is extremely useful in helping plan out my day and dynamically handle the typical bullshit humans have to experience on the daily. 

The CBT isn't enough to help me quit by itself

So far in just 2 weeks, I'm more present, and I've cut amount of weed intake by 50%, from a Q/O to an eighth a week.

From about age 17 to 25, I would wake up from being stoned the night before feeling so goddamn HEAVY. You know what I mean? Just like weighed down both mentally and physically. Every morning, I'd wrestle with myself on my drives to work, saying that I needed to stop. But every night there I was rolling a spliff and loving it. I tried to stop s many times but couldn't.

At that time

The change didn't happen right away. In many ways

I went to Marijuana Anonymous, and MA is one of those contexts where admitting your weakness ends up making you strong.

I still didn't stop smoking right away, that I absolutely KNEW I had to quit to make happen: getting my gf back, and getting into med school.

This is already getting too detailed, this was a full year and a half later. Not 9 months, not 10 months. A year and a half. And I made the realization that I had successfully filled the hole that pot left with OTHER things. Yes, I got my gf back, and yes I was making my way toward med school with great undergraduate grades and worthy extracurricular activities. In essence, I did all the things that being a pothead would make impossible, for me. So these new things that were generating happiness in my life: school, a sense of purpose were all DEPENDENT on my not smoking.

And the craziest thing is that this has changed my actual brain chemistry. How do I know? For pot, that you're only over them when you are completely indifferent? That's what this is. It even has a different effect on me now. I don't even like the feeling anymore! So I have additional protection against this addiction. 

Just a word of warning against being too cavalier with success: if you slip -and I almost did many times- into not just doing it once or twice here and there, but it will protect against relapse. Flaunt your power to deny it, and flaunt it frequently.

I had been smoking for 7 years at the time, slack on my to-do list, and basically get by doing the minimum. Obviously I felt there was a strong possibility that this was a by-product of getting baked all day.

So I cut down for a few weeks during November/December and tried cold turkey but it never lasted for more than a week. Finally, well... two weeks. At that point it was all about keeping the streak alive.

Chances to smoke didn't go away, given that I was fully committed to this change, and in sports you do what it takes to keep the streak alive. I found that relating it to a ""streak"" really helped.

I didn't notice a change after 1 month, maybe the fact that I've been such a heavy smoker means it could take a little while longer."" However, here I am, almost 7 full months into this, and I have yet to notice a day-to-day change in attitude.

I have been thinking about smoking more and more lately. I am quite sure I can prevent smoking from taking over as a priority

At the start of July I moved into an apartment with a friend who smokes about as much as I used to, I always enjoyed blazing, and quitting was essentially to find out what difference it would make.

As of right now, having to buy food on the road, and everything else that comes with that. Being an introvert, I am still as anti-social as I have always been.

My athletic career is top of my priority list right now

So that's my story. I feel that I would be able to start smoking again without changing my lifestyle

I am just looking for some input from some outsiders. 

I also would really like to know if there is anyone else who has quit for a similar duration

Or, period of time? I want to know if I should hold out hope for a change, or if there is essentially zero chance of change after the first month has passed.

Sorry for the long post

I got the recommendation from /r/meditation; there's a link to Meddit Book Recommendations on the side panel that I'm sure contains a treasure trove of gems. I thought I would share with you something I learned today.

Pretty early on

&gt; The term *conation* refers to our faculty of desire and volition. Conative balance, on the other hand, are ways that our desires lead us away from mental health and into psychological distress. Such imbalances are threefold: conative deficit, conative hyperactivity, and conative dysfunction.

&gt; A conative deficit occurs when we experience apathy toward greater happiness and its causes. This apathy is normally accompanied by a lack of imagination and a kind of stagnation: we can't imagine feeling better than we do now

&gt; Conative hyperactivity occurs when obsessive desires obscure the reality of the present. Fantasies about the future - unfulfilled desires - blind us to what is happening here and now. 

&gt; Finally, so our well-being cannot arise independently of others either. To flourish individually, we must consider the well-being of those around us. As Buddha declared, ""One who loves himself will never harm another.""

&gt; The Indian Buddhist contemplative Shantideva comments on conative dysfunction this way: ""Those seeking to escape from suffering hasten right toward their own misery. And with the very desire for happiness, which here means an attraction for something whose desirable qualities we exaggerate while ignoring any undesirable qualities. If our craving is strong, we see the very possibility of our own happiness as inherent to the object on which our mind is bent. This disempowers ourselves and empowers the object of our attraction. When reality breaks through our fantasies, disillusionment sets in. This in turn may lead to hostility and aversion, causing us to now project negative qualities upon the object we once craved.

This perspective really struck a chord with me. I think persistent use creates all of these imbalances. The key for me in quitting was adopting a completely different outlook on my life by reassessing my motivation to act the way I do. No longer do I see my life as misery to be merely endured. Instead

Constantly turning to marijuana:

- Creates apathy by preventing us from imagining a better future or encouraging us to construct false logic for why things can't get better (or why things are just fine the way they are).

- Convinces us that we can be happy *alone*. This just isn't true. All of us need a highly social environment in which to test out our creations

- Makes us prone to flights of fancy that never blossom with real work. We imagine utopia while failing to take any concrete steps to actualize it. We may blame others for the state of the world instead of asking how we can reasonably engage with it.

- Robs us of attention to the present. It hazes out what is happening in the present in our own lives in favor of focusing on all kinds of transitory and unimportant things that have no bearing on us: movies

- Shortens our overall attention span. It becomes impossible or at least torturous to do anything that requires persistence. It doesn't have to be that way. Masters of attentional focus can easily hold their attention on a single object for hours without their mind wavering or becoming discouraged. If we can work to achieve even a fraction of that

- Disempowers us from pursuing our dreams. When we think of an activity we would like to do, how could I get that job? or how could I date that person? I can't, so it's not even worth trying."" This disempowering attitude helps no one! It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that leads to an incredibly unfulfilled life - filled only with *what if*s.

- Manifests consistent bodily tension. When it's been a while since the last hit

- Makes us lash out at people who try to guide us to the right path. We feel hostile and irritable whenever someone suggests we might do better for ourselves.

It doesn't do us any good to love or hate the things we crave. We must learn to love ourselves without condemning any emotion. We must open up to others and the ways that we all have a shared fate. We must learn to desire meaningful action for the reward of the pursuit

Meaningful action should be easy. It only becomes hard when we sabotage our own progress by telling ourselves there's no need to try. When you try as hard as you can every day, toward yourself and others. You can do it!",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,True,,

I also live in CO and got myself a MMJ card and have been smoking the best shit around from dispensaries for the last two years. This past Saturday

I guess I wanted to post here because I've tried several times to quit before, get a joint, then a eighth, then all the sudden I'm right back where I started.

Obviously I'm not the only one with this problem, since the last time I wasn't smoking was when I was 19, I really have no idea what life is going to be like without smoking again at my adult age.

Anyway, the though of smoking always comes to mind. I've dealt with the sleep problems and withdrawls before when trying to quit, but what always gets me back smoking is the comforting thought of relaxing and getting lost in whatever I'm doing. I'm basically never bored when I'm stoned, and now I'm nothing but. Ugh. Any advice on coping with this?

Mom and Dad met in AA meetings, who stayed sober but still didn't know how to raise a kid. Lasted about three years there before he knocked my skull in and I ran away. Shuttled between homeless shelters and foster programs, ended up getting placed BACK with my Dad because no one really wanted to deal with me for long. (As you can imagine, I'd internalized a pretty strong dislike for authority and penchant for violence.)

Squeaked out of my teen years alive, so spent about five years meandering from job to job and home to homelessness. In the process, fell off a roof and royally fucked my back, which was compounded by scoliosis the school docs had never caught and a cyst the size of a fist behind my abdominal wall that I had removed once, and grew back.

My best friend, it was like he had come back alive. He didn't cry all the time, he actually wanted to do things, he LAUGHED again. I tried it, found the first relief I'd had since my back pain started. (With my family history, I always opted for ""deal with it"" rather than risk opioid dependency.)

I started working out again, so I started transitioning anyway.

In the meantime, and cycled through something like 18 medications over the course of three years. He decided to get a fresh start in a new state, and I went with him.

My hormones were off the charts (remember when puberty hit full swing? Yeah, I let him and cut ties. I built a new life from nothing. Again. Lost my car, found a partner, talked my way into a retail job and consistently outperformed anyone's expectations. All while smoking.

Got suicidally depressed earlier this year when I realized there probably wasn't going to be a time when my life became a ""normal"" woman's, started the doc's drugs. Ended up smoking after a month anyway, and back to business as usual.

Two weeks ago, and blew his head off in a park. Went home to find out he'd told everyone how ashamed he was of how things ended with us, and how he wished we could reconnect. I was one of his last friends that he pushed away, and to avoid portraying myself as a saint I said my own share of fucking hurtful things when I was feeling hurt myself. Since it happened, I alternate between autopilot, sleeping too much, smoking myself out of the reality of the situation, and the 15 years I knew him was longer than I'd had contact with anyone in my life including my own parents. We spent most of that 15 years seeing each other every day.

So now I haven't smoked for a week, and pay 20% of everything I make into an insurance policy that, with my shitty retail wage, I still can't afford to use. My back is agony, my cyst randomly abscesses and bleeds, and I'm still a 6'+ woman who questions every look people give me.

Had been smoking daily for ~9 months. Girlfriend had no idea it was a daily thing for me. I avoided the truth and was in denial it was an issue until she brought it up as my smoking was becoming an issue

------------------------------------------------------

Hey guys

I'm glad this subreddit exsist so I can get this off my chest I guess. 


I've been with my girl for a year and a half, steadily increasing. About 9 months ago I secured my first fulltime job, so I was making rad bank so money to buy stopped becoming an issue and I always had it. 
Becuase I loved it and always had it, but not the high I loved, just a relaxed feeling, not necisarily a happy or fun feeling as my tolerance increased. I wasn't enjoying it like I should have been. 
My girlfriend mentioned she was worried that I was smoking more


I recently revealed, and only about close pals knew. My best mate doesn't even know the extent of it, he isn't a fan of it so I don't mention weed to him at all.  


She would sometimes have a smoke with me and I'd be great.. movies, she could smell it but didn't want to make a deal out of it. It was pretty akward and embarrasing hearing this.


Most of out social events are parties or gigs. Over the last year I'd been smoking more  but I'd go out to my car in the street with my mates and hang out for a smoke
With gigs


I knew it was becoming a issue with my increased tolerance with my smoking every day


I've wanted to bring it up with her, i need a break"". 


Every week, health and to be able to say I don't smoke every day if I was asked (without lying).
And everytime I'd convince myself It's ok, I've been at work all day, I deserve a bit of a smoke to unwind and relax""


I've really wanted to take breaks but can't stay commited after a day at most and just fall back into it. I kept convincing myself it's something I could deal with myself and I didn't need to get anyone involved but at the same time I wanted to tell her about it but I was ashamed and afraid of being judged. 


My mate and I buy together



I have been smoking  a quarter a fortnight. to some that's not much.. just a few cones a day. 


So my girlfriend brought it up this week, she was in tears. I ended up breaking down too and admiting I have a problem with it and needed help as I have poor self control with it. 
She was mostly hurt that I had kept this from her for so long. I could totally understand and felt terrible. I never meant for it to get out of hand like it has. I just wanted to enjoy my rise in income for a while but it ended up becoming a habit. 


Now that it's off my chest, I feel I can be more honest now and open.
I went through my room, my bongs etc. threw it all out keeping just my remaining bud and dugout in a locked box. also now that she knows, I've said I'll definatly cut out daily smoking. I can't lie to her, I
m not a liar. This means I have no choice but to oblidge with myself and take it seriously. Alot of her friends and even some family have come close to  destroying relationships caused by our sweet leaf. I'm not going to be one of them


I'm not quitting, from there I can see in hindsight how it was effecting me. Once I've let it out from my system I will smoke again, but with self discpline. Of course not every day or for the sake of it. I want it to be special to me again.


This is day 2. My sleep has been shit and I'm slightly irratable but it's something I can deal with. Although I would love a smoke, gives me something to look forward to.. like that first time. It would be alot harder to deal with if I was straight up quitting.


Hey

Best wishes to the rest of you.

1375946097.0,1jxxym,My Relationship With Cannabis,monetarydread,16,0,6,"

I just had my fourth PM about my new relationship with Cannabis.  Yes

The only way I know how to talk about my relationship with weed is to start from the beginning.  I am on the autism spectrum with a disorder called Aspergers syndrome.  I don’t want to focus on it too much, that nervousness led me to being shy, and this combination of shyness and social impairment leads to others thinking that I am either awkward or creepy.  So think back to when you were in school, how would you have treated the kid who was akward or creepy?  I am fairly certain almost everyone would have treated me like every kid I actually went to school with.  I had few real friends, and the ones I did have tended to abandon me during school because they were embarrassed to be seen with me.  I was never invited to parties, and the only attention I ever received was negative. This all changed near the end of high school for me.  

I remember I was in grade 11 and I finally started to adapt to socializing.  I was still awkward as shit, so I was accepting of the fact that they smoked Cannabis.  When I finally tried the stuff, I fell in love immediately. Despite all the down sides of smoking pot, the positives it brought to my life were immense for the time.  All of a sudden, I was able to make people laugh, my terrifying social anxiety had almost disappeared, and I was able to maintain a rapport with another human for the first time in my life.  To me, Cannabis has been a genuine help for me

Because the positive effects on Cannabis for me were so pronounced, smoke a pinch, and be done with it.  Yet my relationship with the herb was changing.  It was a slow change, at first I just didn’t get as high anymore; this was not a bad thing per-se, I actually prefer being baked to being stoned, but it was a change.  This led to me smoking more pot to the point where I was consuming around ten joints a day. 

 Eventually this abuse caught up with me and it started to affect the thing that made me voluntarily accept this drug in the first place.  I was becoming self-conscious about my ability to interact with others.  You see, or share personal experiences with others.  At first I thought that was just my Aspergers getting in the way of my life, yet looking back with my current experience, I now know it was the weed interfering with my life because I think back to the times I was sober and there were no difficulties.  I was trapped in a vicious cycle though, the cannabis was making me more awkward than normal, then because I felt awkward, I rolled and smoked another joint whenever there was a pause in conversation.  Because of this, and when money was no concern I would smoke a bag in ten days or less.  
Somewhere along the way, smoking pot, and playing video-games until the wee-hours of the morning.  I was content to continue down this path because, though I was not happy, I was content.  It was something that gave me a reason to get up in the morning, it gave me a reason to rush home with excitement, it gave me a reason to avoid all the difficulties I should have been fighting to fix. 

 This was the main reason why I quit, I was struggling with my short-term memory, and integrating new experiences into my life were sacrificed because of my new character trait of extreme apathy. 

Now that I have quit, all things considered.  My brain was constantly asking me to refuel my exogenous cannabinoid stores (exogenous mean outside, I will get to why that is relevant in a minute).  This desire was all-encompassing, but workable.  I just gave away all my pot (almost a full ounce of the stuff) and paraphernalia (including my $300 vapourizer) to my friend Troy, then just removed myself from the world for a week.  I slept a total of eight hours that week, and I felt like shit because of it. Yet, that was the easy part of quitting.  


Warning, just my memory from an intro psych class I took almost a decade ago)

You see, or they work to do the exact opposite and retard brain function when needed to make life becomes more tolerable.  They tell your body to release dopamine (important in the brain's reward system), they tell your body to release serotonin (the happy chemical), melatonin (the sleep chemical), or tryptophan (an amino acid that helps regulate hunger).  Cannabinoids allows you to stop thinking when trying to go to bed at night.  It allows to you stop obsessing over that girl that turned you down last Friday.  It allows you to sit down and enjoy a movie / TV show / game, etc.  

So after reading this, which has physical addiction (makes  the act of abstaining for a week more difficult), but the tough part of quitting smoking weed is that the more you smoked, the longer it takes to get back to normal.  After six weeks my brain has not gone back to normal yet.  I cannot sleep properly.  I have these intense dreams that I have never experienced before (note: I have not had a dream that I remember in over a decade) I still feel emotionally weak in comparison to before I quit, and that weakness has been difficult to adjust to.  I am in a constant state of anxiety that makes all my worst fears unbearable to deal with.  My brain feels like it is operating at full speed at all times, and no matter how much I attempt meditation, I cannot obtain a clear state of mind.  Really, but the feeling of being overwhelmed by the emotions and past mistakes are crippling to me.  

You see, that I will never be able to have a genuine connection with another human being.  That my thousands of hours of practice socializing will be for nothing, and I will be left to live life alone until I die.  It’s been thirty years of not having a girlfriend, and the people that I can truly call friend are so few that I can count them on one hand.  I know that these thoughts are not true, that I am just imagining the worst possible scenarios, and I really have progressed in these areas.  Hell, in the past couple of months I have shown myself that I can go into a bar, and although it is a woman who I am attracted to, and that science has shown that Cannabis causes no permanent brain damage

I don't get this shit.  Thinking about it now for some reason it's making me laugh

I'm not gonna pretend I'm *really* bad off.  I've lurked here a bit and know I've actually got a decently mild addiction.  I smoke an 8th every 1 or 2 weeks.  I know that's not a lot

But like I said

But it's so fucking stupid.  It's some ridiculous feedback loop that I don't understand.  Pretty much every time I'm high (either drunk, whatev) I have this vision of myself.  This ideal person I want to be.  I can see myself as this great person who's accomplished so much through sheer determination and effort and who is proud of who he is and what his accomplishments are. A person who isn't necessarily sober, but who has absolute control over himself   and gets high from time-to-time as an 'added bonus' to life, not as ...whatever the fuck I do it for.  I can clearly see this person, and I say to myself ""God I want to be him.""  And when I'm high, nearly every time in fact, I resolve to become *him*, I'm already high... I'll start later"", etc).  And then when I'm sober... I dunno.  It seems like I want to be that person

Take two days ago for example.  I've had a really weird/messed up sleep schedule for the past month or two, and I got high last night.  Time to do actual work.""  ...But of course 30 minutes later I was high.  And I can't even tell you why.  I think that's the worst part.  I had just gotten out of bed. I was having, by all accounts so far a very good day, and yet for some reason I said ""Fuck it, let's get high.""  Usually it's at least ""Oh it's 2AM and there's nothing to do.  May as well."".  But this was different.  

And I've experienced this weird feeling before.  This kind of 'being-high-is-nice-and-I-have-no-real-reason-not-to' feeling.  This, ""If only you were high...then it'd be better"". This is the urge I know I need to fight but for whatever reason it seems like it's not gonna happen. Either because it's futile, because I convince myself it's pointless, or because I get high and forget about it.  

Anyway this kind of brings me back to my point:  It's fucking stupid.  Every time I 'try' to quit and fail I either convince myself that I didn't 'actually' try or that weed just isn't as bad for me as I make it out to be.  But I know I am addicted.  I feel like life is somehow 'less' without it.  And I feel like I have a pretty good grip on the world. I'm a scientist, sentient being is, and I know life itself should be plenty reward for being alive.  But for some reason I just don't want to stop being not-sober.  And that's why I've run out of weed and resorted to stealing my mom's vodka.

Anyway

The more I harped on going longer without weed, my pothead friends had little to NO influence on me. I'd look up and realize that I hadn't smoked in 'several weeks' until I looked up and realized those several weeks had turned into a couple of months.

I saw it ONLY through the perspective of it being a ""job"" and not a damn thing otherwise. Now my friends come over and knock out rillos and bowls and I do nothing but think of how fucking difficult it was to finally be where I am now and never get an ounce of urges to partake further.

I smoked for the first time at age 16.  I was a nerdy misfit who sought out cannabis after a friend showed me The Union.  I grew up in a home with 2 parents that have chronic OCD.  I was living in a state of constant anxiety and depression my entire life.  From my first hit

The little wooden box quickly started to destroy my life.  A quick toke before school was fun.  But then the box came with me in my pocket everywhere; rehearsals, cruising around with my buddies and hotboxing cars.  I was part of a group and completely comfortable in my own skin.  It was a weird feeling at first, but I grew to realize that this feeling was confidence.

I went on to start my freshman year of college and all of my progress vanished.  I was afraid of meeting new people and sat in my room vaping the days away.  I stuck to a small group of some guys I knew from high school.  Leaving my dorm room to smoke with them was what I considered a social life.  I don't even want to think about the money I blew just in the first semester.  I decided to rush a fraternity in the spring to branch out my social circle and not have to smoke off my loneliness.  I didn't get in.  From there my anxiety and depression were back in full swing

I got home for the summer two weeks ago.  I kept smoking.  I didn't hit up any of my old friends.  I was afraid to talk to people.  I held myself prisoner in my own house

Day 3 started about an hour ago. I'm starting to feel better than I have been.  But I realize that now I must push myself to deal with the issues that I have been masking with weed for the past 3 years. Not sure how to go about that.  I find myself to be a very introspective person and can usually talk myself through my issues, I fear that I may not like what I learn about myself while having a clear head.  I never really developed good coping skills and am afraid that I may give into the temptation to self-medicate.  ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,

Long story short

I know this is coming at the right time. As a young college student, and many possibilities of fate will occur. It was bound to happen. 

Weed had taken over every facet of my life. I was smoking everyday I was smoking to avoid sobriety. Getting high took priority over schoolwork

* Anxiety and anxiety attacks
* Tinnitus (most frustrating at times)
* Insomnia 
* Loss of appetite
* Depression

At this point (11-12 days since last consumed) the anxiety is somewhat under control.  Dealing with random anxiety spikes that can come out of nowhere and have no relation to the current situation.  The insomnia now is only in effect when the tinnitus gets bad (hard to sleep with that constant noise).  Appetite is back fortunately and I'm starting to feel normal.

I've tried numerous times to quit



I've been unemployed for months now, weed gave me motivation because I could do mundane tasks because my mind would be somewhere else drifting while my body sort of operated on autopilot.

The second week, not real life.  I'm still pretty depressed each day, I try to exercise and ride my bike and slowly try to do things I used to do high but now do them sober.  It's not easy.

So, I just wish I didn't feel so depressed and isolated because my social circle and weed were basically the same thing.  Essentially, I am by myself almost everyday, which leads to boredom, which leads to you know what.

I'm 5'11 and weigh about 140lbs

I don't really have much of a desire to smoke weed, which in the past weed used to be my medicine but it can't be that anymore.  Now, I look forward mostly to sleeping because my dreams are awesome, sleep itself is almost like a drug because the dreams are so intense and powerful, as opposed to my real life which has become dreary and lacking direction.

I hope each day that I can get out of this depressed state and try to get a job soon and get on the right track because weed really just makes your head swirl around with thoughts that don't make much sense

The first time I ever smoke was Summer 2003, years past and I grew up and got married and became a mom and it just didn't seem worth it anymore. I've always had a love/hate relationship with smoking but after three days of not having it (because I couldn't find any) I said enough is enough. I recently lost my job and wanted to find a decent one making over minimum wage and quitting smoking would play a big role in that. But it wasn't until two weeks after losing my job that I finally quit. I've never felt so relieved. I really feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I don't feel like I have a crutch anymore. I always made excuses for why I should smoke (had a bad day a work, bored, I'm annoyed and have anxious, and so on) but now I'm finding other ways to deal with these problems. It's been easy so far but I know it will get hard. But I'm happy knowing I have support for people that care and are going through the same things I am when it comes to quitting. I know in the end it's going to make things better and that's what matters most.

Every time I have the opportunity to smoke now (which has been three times since I quit) I just remind myself that I've come this far. Why fuck it up now. It's just not worth it anymore.

1337987980.0,u58ke,If you are having a hard time quitting and also consume lots of sugar and/or caffeine then read this...,lalatoodamaka,18,3,13,"Hi leaves 

I just want to stress the importance of diet when trying to quit. Many people that seem to be addicted to weed are covering up the bad effects/feelings of a terrible diet.  We are not meant to be going on blood sugar rollercoasters every day. Sugar/simple carbohydrates digest too rapidly and send you up and down. Simple carbs are mainly in processed foods, etc.  We aren't adapted to always consuming fast digesting foods, but when you eat them all the time your body gets so used to them that you can also have withdrawals when you switch to non processed, slow digesting foods. Same with caffeine.  If you seem to have crazy emotional swings when you quit smoking and feel like you need weed to be normal then look at your diet. Start a log at least, write down everything you eat, the time, and the mood you are in.  Look at the relation.

This worked for me. I got my own blood sugar monitor and figured out that my blood sugar was going up rapidly to 180-190 after a typical meal that I ate and then dropping to around 60 very quickly. Some will say 60 is nothing to worry about

You might have been raised on a similar diet. I was. It's hard to make the link when you don't know what it feels like to eat a good unprocessed delicious diet.  You may also have a problem with milk or wheat and not be aware. I didn't buy into it for a long time after I eliminated simple carbs but I decided to eliminate whole wheat as well and I felt even better. When I reintroduced wheat I broke out in hives. I tried reintroducing wheat 3 times with the same results.  I don't think wheat is bad. I think the way it's grown now is.

Anyways, but it's usually caused by too many simple sugars, carbs, caffeine, and possibly too much tobacco. All of these things raise your blood sugar rapidly causing it to crash back down again and again. Your brain suffers the most from this.   

Eliminate processed foods and caffeine from your diet, complex carbs like brown rice, potatoes. Exercise 20 minutes twice a week, take a whole food multivitamin and get 20 minutes of sun a day on most of your body. I made these changes and now I can go without smoking for any length of time without losing function, without having wild mood swings, etc.

I am definitely habitually addicted. Lately, and a shitload, but it's something that doesn't want to stop. I'm not very good at moderation, and that's an issue.

I had to do this right away, and for months after, I quit dope too. Probably from November until late march really. It was good, I was more organized, motivated, recovered extremely well.

Been smoking now for 4 years - infrequently. Possibly a gram a week.

I stopped from Jan-April of this year - it was hard but I started working out instead

I relapsed for a day afterwards sometime this month and I feel I cannot go down this path again. 

My friends are coming back from college this summer (I am a recent graduate roughly 1.5 years out) and I feel I would relapse hard. They all smoke, and they live across the street. *The kicker is* - they want to stop too. But we are both waiting who brings it up first, caves first, and the other ones with follow. 

Every year we'd sit outside on our porch, making food and hanging out. Some of my fondest moments are derived from this very plant. Moreover, I have turned down jobs in financial sector.

I'm overweight, feeling totally full. I've lost a nearly 10 pounds already. How easy it is to control my portions is what is keeping me from wanting weed. I'm associating pot use with me being a fatass and if I want one to change, I have to change the other.

I've found my home in NA meetings

My addiction experience involves other drugs as well, dependable friend. I relied on it for years to deal with any and all feelings, to celebrate &amp; mourn, etc. 

In the last 2 or 3 years, my family had lost faith in me, and I had lost myself entirely. Every day was constant fear, as I had developed paralyzing fears of going out in public (agoraphobia). I was a social person trapped in horrible obsessive fear. My life was hell. As they say, when I was beaten, I became willing. . 

Went to my first meeting and was terrified. I was greeted by some incredible women, like making healthy friends and participating in meetings by making coffee or doing readings) and feeling a sense of pride for those victories. Baby steps, self compassion, patience, and taking things moment by moment. 

I've made some incredible friendships in recovery so far. I love NA

The next weekend he came over and we smoked shit brown ditch weed out of an aluminum can with matches in the bushes outside my parent's house. I did not get high

By the time we got back inside the actual house, and I was basically hooked right then and there. I immediately fell in love with weed. Head over heels.

I started smoking every chance I could get. All the money I could obtain went to buying weed. My mom and dad were both very successful in their professions, so that's how I pay for my habit now. If my situation was different, I wouldn't be able to afford this lifestyle without growing.

Shortly after high school I joined the military. I had been kicked out of my mom's home and had no way to make money. I suspect I knew there was something wrong with my relationship with pot, and was known as a drunk. I was told to attend AA meetings. This was my first encounter with 12 step programs.

I got out, and it's very difficult to consistently perform because I'm constantly baked. I basically have no real friends, only vague associates. I live in CA, so I have a medical card. There's really nothing unusual or special about what I'm doing, except for the quantity and consistency.

I've started to go to NA meetings, and go to fairly dramatic lengths to mask the fact that I'm baked, with dubious success. I suspect there are a few people I'm not fooling. I also tell everyone that I'm addicted to Oxycontin. I'm embarrassed that my ""drug of choice"" is a fucking plant when all of those people are hooked on crack, speed, or dope. I feel like they look down on me as not having a real problem, and now I'm sticking with my lie because I don't want to have to explain any of this shit. I'm been going to these meeting for over three years. The longest I've managed to stay clean was 8 months, and then I just couldn't go on. I was losing my fucking mind.

These days, put some eyedrops in, take care of it, and start smoking again. I watch TV, Netflix, or occasionally play a video game. I pick up a guitar from time to time, but not as much as I should. I know I can make my life something more than this endless cycle of obsession and compulsion. 

I sometimes think that all of this could be fixed with a relationship, I can't run... I'm generally terrified to know of the extent of the damage I've done to my body. I haven't informed a doctor about my behavior because I'm embarrassed. Isn't that human? How quintessentially human. I might have some sort of terrible cancer, and I'm not getting any kind of medical attention because of a fear of diminishing a doctor's positive perception of me. God damn it, that's just plain irrational.

I've tried to quit recently, nausea, and irritability. These kick in after a few hours, and the most difficult one is the eating thing. Food is completely unappealing unless I've literally just got done smoking a bowl. 

I can't go on like this. I'm going to be 30 in a few years, but I've been telling myself that for years now. I'm going out of the country on a vacation next month. I'll be forced to stop for two weeks, and my intention is to make my stand when I get back.

Well, but I'm going to smoke probably three or four more bowls before going to sleep. I'm kind of not feeling it so much anymore since I sat down to write this.

Sometimes, but, ultimately, I feel like I've been chasing something that was never really there to begin with. I feel like I can change things, though. I believe that people can change, but how that happens is largely mysterious, and the path forward is unclear.

But even that has faded drastically and overall my quality of sleep has gotten much better. My confidence and clarity has improved and I am able to see things more clearly. Over the first couple of weeks I was faced with very strong urges and thought processes of, there is obviously a reason and you know that weed is hindering you in one way or another. Initially the thought of never smoking again was terrifying and felt like saying goodbye to an old friend forever. I was finally able to convince myself that there is no harm in quitting for a short period (in the grand scheme of things). Something like a year or at least enough time to get disciplined and closer to my goals. Knowing that I wasn’t saying goodbye forever and having that hope in the back of my mind has made it easier to make it through the first month. Now that I have made it this far, I am not one of those people. I abused it and if I smoke again I will abuse it again. So I’m done.

I said I can identify completely, and he knew just what I was talking about. This is something I have to work on. I want to lose the weight and stop looking to reward or soothe myself on a daily basis.

* My partner been wonderfully supportive, but I did ask. He says I'm more fun and spontaneous now. He said I was always fun, but now it's a different kind of fun. I don't have to smoke before everything, so it's easier to make snap decisions to do something cool. More adventurous. I like that too. 

* I am a lady, when I reach those emotional moments before my period, I find my mind wishing I could smoke to just calm me down and put it aside, especially because it's only hormonal -- it's not like I'm upset because I have some real problem I need to solve. My body is just letting that stuff out, and it's uncomfortable and inconvenient. But, the awareness helps. ""It's PMS. It'll pass. I don't need to smoke.""

* Sober life is not boring. I definitely had to do some mental adjusting at the beginning to realize this, you have more creative ideas, nature blows your mind), you're also giving up something. The movie might be funnier, but you can barely remember it afterward. You might have an amazing idea, but you don't do anything with the idea.

* I'm going to keep hanging around /r/leaves. I'd thought about taking space from it, even when they've been sober a long time.

I've been academically dismissed from my university with a 1.26 GPA (I held a 4.0 throughout high school). I started smoking when I was 19 in January of 2012 and it quickly escalated from every Friday to twice a week, he kept his $500 bong there since he lived in the dorms nearby. I only smoked for a year but I bought at least a quarter a week, to the point of no thoughts. I loved weed and it really helped me sometimes

Background: I was a very straight edge kid (no alcohol or any mind altering substances) until I was 19, and for awhile it was, I made a lot of friends through smoking. It made me relax, and I have always had trouble sleeping and not dwelling on my mistakes. I obsess over things very easily and one might even say I have an addictive personality. I was addicted to WoW (world of warcraft) and have probably 2 years of logged playtime into that game ( played from 8th grade-12th grade). I played that game for about 4-12 hours a day for probably a solid two or three years. So, I can easily become obsessed with things, and smoking was no exception. 

But this past spring semester I took a class that truly inspired me to do something with my life and stop rotting away in a hazy apartment. I took an intro to math and science education course that involved teaching real lessons to real local 3rd-5th grade classes. I loved it, I didn't go to class, instead I got high and played video games with my friends. Sometimes I would miss because I slept in (pretty much any class before 11 am falls into this category, which was 2 of my fall '12 classes). What I'm getting at is this- I have to present a narrative of how my addiction to smoking caused me to fail so miserably to the dean of my university so that he will reinstate me for one more semester. I already have met with him once where he told me that if I do well enough when he readmits me, he can erase a couple of F's to bring my GPA to the 2.0 required. I'm supposed to have a compelling reason for why I failed and some proof that I've turned around, that I'm ready for school now. I feel like I've thrown away a lot of love, trust, and time.

I have bipolar and the anger and frustration I get from dealing with the pointless job and a terrible boss manifest in me as unbearable depression. I compulsively smoke away the negative feelings but smoking in excess worsens my depressive episodes as I cope with the withdrawal symptoms.

Today, quitting was different. From day 1, I had almost no desire to smoke and gave away my $300 vaporizer, flushed the rest of my weed down the toilet and broke my bong without any regrets. The mental game changed for me. I am not getting any younger and I am so done with my current job.

What have I done with myself in that time? I made some serious effort to do more than just talk about making an Android app and released it in March (sorry, I have been on the job hunt for a programming job and have my first in-person interview this Friday. I have another interview lined up for a few weeks from now and have some more irons in the fire.

I've been studying my ass off and am saving nothing for the [swim back](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYZ_77qxRr0). 

This is it. I can't stay at my current job any longer and I desperately want to start this new career. It's not a question of if, however.

I've never had this mindset about anything in my life before and it is simultaneously the scariest and most stressful period

Weed is great. It's better than alcohol and man it's fucking amazing to smoke after a stressful day or even a non-stressful day. This isn't about weed. It's about facing life without a crutch that makes you tolerate where you're at. It's about setting your own course and being the master of your own destiny.

I've been wanting to quit for a while for various reasons.. I've been a smoker for almost 6 years now, and feel as though my life has been stagnating for quite a while.  I feel generally unhealthy and unhappy with myself.

Recently I've traced most of it back to the weed.

I quit for 31 days from February-March, I lost a decent amount of weight and I felt really productive and excited.

But I made the mistake of thinking I could have a few bowls as a celebratory ""end of vacation"" sort of deal in late March. It was a terrible idea. I've smoked almost every day since then

I'm going to stop smoking again as of today. I'm partnering stopping smoking with trying to cook more so that I have something to occupy my time and energy instead of getting high, and I'm going to try and be more sociable.  All the money I'm going to be saving from not buying and from not spending a shit ton of money on my munchies is going to be put into a savings account.

1. I threw all my shit down the drain last night. On previous quitting attempts

2. In addition to throwing my stash away

3. I'm going to switch to decaf coffee for at least the first week or two. Previously

4. I set 2 reminders on my phone to go off everyday. The first is right after lunch for when I'm at work and feeling the anxiety/stress from quitting. It says: *""You will feel stressed out for awhile, and everything will work out alright.""* The second is set to go off right when I get out of work, when I'd normally be thinking about blazing. It says: *""Don't smoke [roommate]'s or anyone else's weed! It's the first step to improving your life!""* I feel that these reminders will help keep me motivated.

5. I'm going to tell my smoking buddies that I'm sorry, I just ended up calling them and mooching off them for weed because I didn't have any. This might be difficult with my roommate who I smoke with all the time, but I think she will be understanding.

6. Exercising always helps quitting, and it will make my body and mind feel better.

I think the turning point for me was last night. I was just sitting in bed totally baked, and how I haven't done any of them. Being high isn't really even fun anymore. I've become an antisocial and boring person, and my smoking habit is mostly to blame. I really want to get clean, get back in shape, and embrace life instead of watching it float by in a haze.

1364578551.0,1b947y,Relapsed Last Night,joepoo,16,1,1,"Over the last couple of months, I would almost instantly regret it. Going back and forth lately, then sober

When I'm high, I can't control my thoughts. Because I can't do that, I can't control my words or my actions. Why do people like this feeling so much? Anyway, some of my findings about weed over the past couple months include the following:

* weed affects everybody different psychologically
* as an introvert, as my mind has adapted to the speed of conversation. When I'm in the haze however, not only when I'm high, but during a period in which I smoke semi-regularly, that process becomes very slow, with much self doubt and lack of confidence in the words that do come out. My usual responses when high include ""yeah,"" ""that's cool,"" or some other half-assed communication. It's no way to form relationships with others.
* stoners have little friends because they block out everybody in their life that doesn't smoke. The social dynamics within a stoner group is highly complex, so many of them have different opinions on each person within the group. Because of the stoner mentality of avoiding conflict, the reason someone might become slowly outcasted by the group never gets brought up. I feel like people who smoke one on one and then are in a group environment, want to block out everyone else but their individual stoner buddy. Group discussions within a stoner group (for my case at least) are always pretty slow, unproductive, and a little awkward. I leave those sessions feeling totally stupid and like I wasted a bunch of time.
* for me
* weed stunts emotional growth. My stoner friends hardly ever smile, or any show any other emotion other than ""chill."" Living like this, day after day, for months and sometimes years, must have detrimental setbacks on emotional development in a person, and is no way to live a life.

So anyway, the loneliness is still present when I'm high with friends, in fact it's almost worse because I realize I'm feeling lonely among my friends, making me feel like there's something wrong with me. Then I want to be sober again. It's a vicious cycle, but now that I know why I go back to weed, I can work on not being so lonely (make other friends and such).  Non-stoners are so much more interesting than potheads, too. I hope my findings are relatable for my fellow leave-users

1363168387.0,1a7hg3,A success story about my old roommate. ,regon,17,3,2,"Hello everyone. I just stumbled across this subreddit and it made me instantly think of my freshman roommate. I know that success stories can be motivating

The summer before my freshman year of college (2010) i was looking for a roommate. Our school provided a roommate finder online. Basically a survey that found the most compatible results. As i was scrolling through my list of potential roommates

Now, and Rick was good friends with this guy. Whenever i picked up from my dealer i would see Rick there, so i had a general idea about the level of his marijuana use. Plus i smoked with Rick a few times in high school. 

The first week at the dorms, noticed a business opportunity. He decided to start selling to these guys and their friends (who were pretty much all on the football team). I was fine with it. He smoked me out a lot as a result, and he was pretty smart about it. Slowly, over the course of months, he built up his clientele, and as a result, the amount he was selling. It started at ounces and increased to quarter lbs, etc. Fast forward to march

All the while, Rick was smoking many times a day. He was going to class high, he was smoking before he ate, he was smoking before he slept. It got to the point where he couldn't function unless he had smoked. I try not to be a judgmental person, so i didn't say anything about it. But I knew it was pretty fucked up how this guy wasn't hungry unless he was high, and couldn't fall asleep unless he had smoked. And while he was pushing a good amount of weed, he wasn't making any profit because he was smoking it away.

It came to a climax one day in spring when he got caught with a large amount. It sucked because it was just a routine traffic stop. Rick had around a pound or so in his car as well as baggies. The cops smelled weed and Rick got busted. Needless to say

I was surprised as to how Rick handled it. He basically saw it as a sign that he needed to stop smoking for good.  It was rough for him for the first month or so. He lost weight as his appetite decreases

Now, he improved his diet dramatically, got a job, and started working out more. 

He remained sober for about a year and a half. He smokes occasionally now, diet, etc. I really believe getting busted was a good experience for him. 

I know for a lot of you guys you aren't going to have a dramatic experience like this. But i wanted to let you know that you really can improve your life by not smoking, ever since Rick got busted, i've decreased my pot usage by a lot. I was smoking about once a day back then, and now i smoke maybe once a month. A lot of that has to do with money (i still can't understand how self titled ""poor college students"" afford so much weed) but it also has to do with what i saw in Rick. I go to the gym a lot now (i've gained around 25 lbs of muscle in the last two years) and i'm generally pretty happy.

My backstory: 33 yo, and for a few months once when I was on the road for work, but every time I would toke up as soon as the opportunity was there. These were more forced quits rather than something that I wanted.

This time

I already have a good job, two cars, one house (and a second on the way), and pretty much anything I wanted in life (including as much weed as I could handle). I don't make tons of money, but I'm very good at managing the money that I do make. From outward appearances, most people would probably think that I'm making more than I actually do.

That being said

I'm also so sick and tired of coughing up endless tar balls. More than anything else

The crazy thing is that I'm a pretty avid runner. It just doesn't jive well with the smoking. I hated finishing up a 10 mile run

When I was younger, and I was left with a few die-hards who basically told me that they have no intention to ever stop. It made me think: is that what I want? The answer is a solid NO!

I've tried to moderate my use many times, ""There is a time and place for almost everything."" The problem was that I was often using marijuana in an inappropriate time and place. I wasn't living up to my own mantra.

My wife has never smoked as much as me

So, the only appropriate times to smoke are now in the past. The future holds none. Having this definitive clarity in my mind is helping me. There is no ambiguity.

The #1 thing that I feared about quitting was the insomnia. I've experienced it hardcore every other time I've stopped. But recently

I can't get too hung up on any one opportunity, which I did and I hated... but many of us date for the purpose of finding one match. Just one. I can count my blessings that I have found my match.)

I am also wresting with my sate's unemployment office to sort out my benefits

This would all be worse if I was smoking. If I was smoking, making phone calls where I'm on hold for 45 minutes?

I had an open conversation with my partner last night about why this stuff bothers me so much. I always want to put it off. When I was younger, and then I'd make the call to get it paid. More recently, before my partner and I lived together, I would put off doing dishes for weeks, until they got really disgusting. Why would I do this? One more day of not doing them didn't have immediate consequences, and I ate out out a lot so I could keep ignoring the mess. *Smoke smoke smoke, watch tv. What dishes? What bills? They can wait. Smoke smoke smoke.*

For people who don't know

I'm a guy in my early twenties.  Around March of this year, too.  At first, it was just a little 1 gram bag.  I took a couple of puffs, felt kind of light and euphoric, and then I would go do something else. I guess we know how this story ends.  It only got worse after that.  The small gram bags turned into 3 gram bags.  Then I saw how I could be saving money by buying lager sizes (""Thirty bucks for ten grams. Hellz yeah! Now I won't have to stock up for a looong time!"" (yeah, right)).

My tolerance went up extremely fast.  I was able to keep it exciting for a while by switching between different brands whenever a certain one wasn't doing it for me anymore.  Within a month or so, lay in bed for 15 minutes, get up, smoke, get tired, lay in bed or 15 minutes, accidentally fall asleep for 2 hours, smoke

I've lost god knows how many hours of sleep because I try to stay up and smoke.  I wake up 3 or 4 times during the night, and I always have to fight myself to quit and start getting ready for work.  To everyone at work, I seem totally fine, but when I get home and my work self turns into my burnout self.  It's like I have two totally different personalities, and one comes out promptly at six every day.

Right now, when I officially run out I immediately feel bored and almost panicked, because I'm not sure what to do, or I feel like anything I do to pass the time would be boring compared to smoking, even if I knew that the smoking would only make me tired.

I don't hang out with friends nearly as much as I used to. I have no real serious hobbies to speak of.  I've always been quick to take things too far with spice or weed, and was on my way to buy more at about 12:30 am.  Seeing the darkened windows in people's apartments, knowing that they seem to have a normal sleep cycle, and knowing that I was on my way to a seedy porno shop to buy more because it's the only place still open at this hour was enough to make me really feel like a piece of shit and turn around.  This has been my life for almost 9 months now.  I've forgotten what I used to do with my time, and how I used to feel day-to-day without being high.  I want to try to get through this week on my own, then I'll be visiting family until New Year's, so I won't be able to smoke then.  That's how I've been defending my smoking this month - ""After I can't smoke around family for a few days, so I might as well enjoy it for now.""

I'm just god damn sick of it.  I actually had to stop typing this post a few times because I started feeling sick to my stomach reflecting on it.

I'm basically a completely different person than I was three weeks ago as a result of this regime. My memory is better than it was before weed and my cognitive abilities are much

1) Cardio exercise. I'm on week 3 of a Couch to 10K program

2) A nootropic stack. Basically I fixed my nutrition first by using a shake powder called Vega, eggs, etc and a multivitamin/multimineral. B vitamins and all the minerals are really important in particular.

But here's the stuff that made the biggest difference:

Piracetam: this is available without a prescription in most supplement stores in the US and is legal for import (for personal use) in Canada

Choline: this stuff you need to play with as everyone is different. Some people don't need it at all

Creatine: 5g in the mornings. Make sure you drink enough water. I'm currently also experimenting with glutamine but as I'm only on day two I can't speak for it yet.

Omega 3 fish oil capsules: I take one with each piracetam dose

L-theanine &amp; Caffeine: right now I just drink two cups of green tea a day which has good ratios of this but most people actually use supplements. L-theanine is spectacular at keeping anxiety at bay and this combo is a good motivator for actually getting shit done. You need more l-theanine than caffeine.

I'm 21, sometimes vaping every day--I'd say I vaped every other day of this year. I went through a half-eighth a week at most. I have always given myself reassurance that I'm not ""one of them,"" since I have friends who smoke much larger amounts than me. But the fact that these thoughts occurred on a DAILY basis, especially when I was high, was always something that I refused to be bothered by. I certainly felt like stopping many, many mornings that I woke up, only to vape again night after night.

Last Sunday night

Towards the end of the video, I did. I pulled my ""stash box"" out of the back of my closet, and put EVERYTHING in my room that was related to weed in my box--mason jars, grinder, papers, vaporizer, and put my bowl in my back pocket. I flushed a full eighth of weed down the toilet. It occurred to me how ""legit"" of a stoner I had become as far as my ""gear"" looked. A large box full of paraphernalia goodies.

I walked a few minutes to the interstate, it was like the recoil of a powerful shotgun. ""OH. I just did that."" Then, I walked over to the bridge of the interstate. I took my bowl out of my pocket, and chucked it against the wall. A satisfying shattering sound. It was really beautiful.

I have now been sober and feeling clearer for a week now. It's quite a different feeling than my other 'breaks' in the past. I don't have my tools waiting for me when I feel 'ready' in 1-3 weeks. This is for real. I am not smoking weed for a long time

Some regrets flashed through my mind over the next few days

-Why didn't I sell some of that stuff?
-What if I never smoked again? Weed has opened my mind! I need it on some basis.
-WHY did I flush my weed?! I love weed!

To the first point: I consider it the best $200 I've ever thrown away. I don't have to deal with someone else having my burden

To the second point: I will surely smoke again in my life

Ran across this sub last night while looking for quitting tobacco resources (more on this in a moment) and I thought I'd share my story with you all. It may help.

I've been a quarter-a-week smoker for almost 17 years and I've recently lost my job. At first, I borrowed and I managed to keep myself stoned (I even considered selling it)...but eventually, money ran out, friends stopped coming by and, after last Tuesday, the supply (and my finances for said supply) ran out entirely. It is admittedly difficult to spend $300 a month on pot when you don't have $300 a month that isn't spoken for already.

I was pretty scared at first - I was actually going to have to deal with myself and my boredom. Terrifying stuff, because she wouldn't want to deal with the intensity. I'm a pretty book-smart guy and lengthy dissertations on the efficiency of coffee pot placement in relation to the kitchen sink, for example, tend to put people off.

But that isn't at all what happened.

Yes, I was pretty trashed...but I didn't just fall asleep like I usually do. I was up all night and into the next day. Usually, I'll smoke a bowl before bed, but in the absence of a bowl to smoke my brain sort of fed back on itself and I just spent the next day sort of half in bed and half not. When I finally did sleep, I slept for about three hours. This continued on until today, when I managed to get a solid 8 hours of sleep in and woke up at 4 this afternoon. Of course, it's now 5am and I'm sitting on Reddit, I'm sure.

One of the things I noticed starting around Day 3 or so was that I was more aware of the state my life has been in and painfully aware of how I smoked so I didn't have to look at it. I always thought I was ""The Enhancement Smoker

The problems are still there, a clean apartment - these were things that seemed out of reach or undesirable before. I want these things badly now. Very badly.

College is the big one...I'm in my 30's and I decided after high school that I would rather get a shitty job and lay around smoking pot and playing games than actually point my brain at something useful and helpful for others. Who needs college when you already have a job? What a mistake that was! 

My girlfriend and I had a long talk about everything last night (she doesn't smoke), yeah!), and I can probably even keep that job while I'm there (or find one that will work with me and my schedule). Passing that first drug test on my own merits is going to be freaking awesome. I'm generally more motivated and actually want things more than I can ever remember. It feels good.

I love gaming and I was really afraid that I wouldn't even want to bother with it anymore...but I've been hammering away just as though I were knee-deep in a bag of grass

And smoking cigarettes...before, I decided that this would be the first monkey I strangled and sent to the Zoo of Shame. I [have a plan now](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/10c9lb/lets_do_this/) and I am taking steps to eliminate tobacco from my life completely. Unfortunately, the ashtray I use is an antique - but that is no reason to keep it. I'm sure someone else could use it; I won't want to see it again after I quit. And I will be keeping a non-Bic lighter around for lighting incense (can't smoke pot with it - makes me sick as hell). Maybe a Zippo. Try smoking a bowl with one of those! :p

I haven't had a funeral for my weed stuff yet...I have two extremely beautiful glass pieces and a glass graveyard for all of those fallen brothers of yore. I will probably gift the glass pieces to friends who still smoke and toss the glass graveyard in the dumpster. The graveyard is in a really nice oak chest and I know I can find something else to use it for.

Will I lose the few friends I have left? They all smoke...but a real friend won't judge me on the basis of whether or not I smoke pot. I don't *hate* pot...it's just not right for me...and I promised myself that I wouldn't judge them for their choices. I will ask them to respect mine, and I imagine it will come as quite a shock. I've always been the biggest stoner of the group. If someone doesn't respect my decision...I'll say it here and now and in bold: **FUCK EM**. Of course, this will be after I ask myself whether I even want to be friends with them anymore, or why I was even friends with them in the first place. Maybe I can make some new friends.

A little backstory: in high school I was very success-oriented, I was smart enough to get good grades without applying myself fully. Had I done that, I probably would have had *great* grades and gotten more in scholarship money, but I digress. 

Anyway, when in reality it has likely been a crutch for me since it was a subconscious way to escape responsibility (school still wasn't difficult, but if I hadn't been smoking the entire time I would have a lot more to show from my college career).

I haven't had a job since high school, and a little help from family). Thankfully I've been able to sustain my living situation off my savings and my housing was paid for by my grandparents as their way of saying they were happy I'd chosen the school they had in mind. 

I've recently started working again (self-employed) and I'm in my final semester of college, but I guess I'll know the truth in the coming weeks. 

I feel like proving to myself that I can quit would go a long way for me; I want it to be a first step in bettering myself and getting back to my old, self again. So I guess this is goodbye ""smokebowls420"", hello senorbluesky.

6:30am - drink a pot of coffee, mind foggy from being tired and drained from the 4.5hour exam last night.  Moving slow.  Skating feels sluggish, feel mad sore all over.  

8am - take exam, hard to think, but at least I can think.  Feel alright about the exam, cant say I will do great, but I wont fail at the very least.

9pm - got back to my apt...I want to nap, oh you just did all that hard work, you deserve it. I don't deserve shit.  Don't have the energy to move.

9:30am - itching to smoke, usually will have a joint or a cig while driving, no, I always have something while driving.  Guess Ill just have to jam out to ska or something.

11:30am - showered feel much much much better.  Anger and paitence back to normal levels.  can think clearly and calmly.  Focusing on keeping my day slow

1pm - throat bothering me a bit

May be hard, may seem like an asshole but i got people who arent supporting me. Fuck THEM.  Ill take my health over a stoney friendship.

Driving was so much better sober without anything.  I was able to really drive and not just coast along.  Was my driving more reckless because I felt more sure of my actions. YES. Got to my friends place late. They smoked while I drove us to Subway.  First time smelling or being in the presence of weed since I quit....Can't say I didn't Itch for a toke


Day 3 complete.  


On a side note.  Last night I was able to pass off my pipe, etc etc to a couple friends who I know will take good care of it, and respect it as their own (which I guess it is now).  I did hold onto one device, but it cannot be used in its current sate (missing a key part) and I am going to save it so that I can give it to my close close friend who I know will appreciate it and take care of it and at the very least get some good use out of it.  I know I know Im enabling others, but really they don't have a problem, they arent spitting blood or spending every hour of every day blazed.  Im sad to see it go, but its time for it to happen anyway.    

Side note 2.  I realized I have no smelled

I'm not even sure what's going to be in this box by the time I'm done, but I was just lying there and I suddenly just couldn't get enough oxygen.  No matter how hard I tried.  That sent me into a spiral literally thinking I was dying.  My pulse was fast and then slow, my lungs were freaking out, I was hyperventilating while feeling like I was slowly suffocating. 

I've had ""I dun smoked too much of this really good weed and my heart and brain are freaking out"" moments before.  I'm always able to breathe my way out of it

I didn't know what the cause was.  I'm still getting over a wicked cold so I thought maybe that was affecting my respiratory abilities somehow.  I managed to fall asleep and felt fine the next day

A little background. I smoked/drank/snorted/popped everything I could get my hands on between the ages of 18 and 24.  Coke, weed...everything and anything.  I ended up homeless and in rehab.  Fast forward 3 years.  All of the depression and anxiety I'd been fighting against with all of that ""medicine"" started to creep in little by little after I sobered up.  April of this year I spent alone in my apartment.  I didn't leave unless I absolutely had to.  I didn't have to work, so I didn't.  I didn't do anything but cower alone.  Then a co-worker started smoking a little here and there for the first time in a long time.  I joined him and quickly noticed a change.  I almost immediately went back to being a daily smoker.  Practically overnight, I changed.  I started riding my bike to work instead of taking the bus.  (Lost 20 pounds)  I started hanging out with people I hadn't seen in years.  I, a *chronic* nail biter (I'm talking until my fingers bled, then I'd bite them more) stopped biting my nails completely.  Everything got better, instantly.

That was 9 months ago and here I am now.  Even without the panic attacks

You might be wondering why I am salty.  Today I had a defining moment.  I work in a warehouse and brought my kindle to read on the breaks.  At the end of the day, gone.  During the rage I went through on the drive home, I realized the old me would have loaded a bowl and pushed down those feelings, because damn was it unpleasant.  Oh the fury; pure, unadulterated fury.  But the new me decided to channel that rage into an extremely passionate workout.  I ran on a treadmill with rage in my heart and did push-ups as if I was trying to push the earth down.  I feel so much better.  The fury passed, and now I am ready to talk with my managers and see what I can do about this situation in a calm, collected manner.  Also, which I am looking forward to.

Thanks again

UPDATE:

Did not get my kindle back.  I pretty much expected that though of course I held onto a glimmer of hope.  A funny part of this whole thing is that there are only 8 people in the warehouse, and it felt great.  They said they would do whatever they can to help me and were impressed by how calm I was through this shittiness.  One of them actually confronted her for me (though I did not ask him to).  He took her aside and said he wanted to go 50/50 on the kindle.  Hilarious.  Of course she denied it.  Whatever.  It is so nice to realize I am becoming the person I want to be again and the people around me are responding positively to it.  My life is filling back up with the real love it was severely lacking.  The silver lining here is her stealing my possession showed how little it really meant to my happiness and showed me what is most important.

Been hanging out with stoner and non-stoner friends alike, and strangely, I haven't been getting any urges while my close friends toke up. I've dropped a lot of people who were only in my life because of bud. My close friends (who I think also have problems with weed dependency) have even seen my progress and have set a quit date to prepare for school! I'm so proud of them (and myself? can I say I'm proud of myself? I am!) I've been looking into yoga and meditation and I think I'm gonna give it a shot. Just gotta push myself a little harder, a concept that was foreign to me in my stoner days.

Just to clarify

Hey guys, and I'm a little late on this one. I think its mainly because I'm distancing myself from the drug, however I still follow leaves, and have read every post in the last 32 days.

Feels great for the most part. I still feel a lot of regret (regret all the damage ive done to my brain

For myself, all the time, and thats all that mattered to me... And weed did that... I was productive in school, I could make a to-do list and stroke everything off the list with the help of Mary J. It made me do less thinking, and more doing (I realize for some it does the opposite). After the first year of heavy use, I just realized it wasn't doing its job anymore. It was making me anxious, making me withdraw from others

Until 1 month ago, depression, and irritability for a couple weeks and there would be a wonderful life on the other side. Leaves helped me sooo much through this part.

I feel much better,000,000 times better. My motivation for some things has suffered and I still have trouble being productive through the mundane tasks. Like honestly, cleaning can sometimes suck but when i was high it was a piece of cake. But hey, now I just enjoy having clean surroundings and view it less as something I 'have to do'.

It hasn't solved all my problems. As I mentioned, its usually because I'm trying to go through life without doing anything. I'm glad my body is telling me to get the fuck up and do something instead of being okay as a complacent vegetable.

Looking at my post from day one, I was scared, confused, and didn't know what to expect. When I read it now it is evident I was a different person (which just adds to my will to quit). I had one joint in my pocession the day I quit, and I flushed it down the shitter. At that point I was empowered and I knew I was in for the long haul.

Fast-forward to the present and I am now exhibit A of the unfortunate specimen called ‘functioning daily stoner’. When at school I will smoke before I go to class, my other job, and family dinner. Up until now I had an arsenal of excuses to justify my habit: I go to one of the best schools in the country and have a GPA that has me on track to graduate with high honors, my teetotaling roommate is continually depressed and makes worse grades than I do, I have plenty of disposable income and what else am I going to spend it on, and on and on. 

After a few powerful experiences on Magic Mushrooms and LSD (I am not advocating for or against the use of psychedelics, I no longer wake up and stare at my many zits in anguish and despair. 

And yet I continued smoking in ever-increasing amounts. I felt drained all the time, and decided I needed to get my life back in order. I finished my stash last night and am already feeling irritable, restless and anxious, but I’m ready to plow on through because I no longer want to be a slave to a stinky plant that leaves me sluggish and unfeeling. 

I blame only myself for getting to this place. I still believe marijuana is a wonderful thing that our world needs, I’ll be constantly stoned until the bag runs out.

I have been smoking daily for almost 8 years. I've taken breaks (a month in 2011 and a couple days here and there when I was sick), I had the ""brilliant"" idea that my New Years resolution was to smoke every day of 2006. What can I say, I was 18 and an idiot. I did some really stupid shit too (like taking bong rips...at 4:20am...while driving...on the freeway). I am very lucky that nothing bad happened.

It was the ""cool"" thing to do. Though I struggled with depression and self confidence for most of my life, made life more enjoyable, and got me some friends.

I met my current boyfriend (6 years in October) because of weed. We were friends for a couple years

I've been trying to quit for 2-3 years now. It's been at the ""I know I should, just trying to escape my thoughts and life. Oh, I should mention that I was suicidal from when I was 15 to about 2 years ago, when I started therapy...I'm 25 now). 

My entire relationship with my bf has been high. He smokes too. We love each other a lot, not when he's on-call for work, etc), but I feel like I'm the little devil on his shoulder, though I've never explicitly made/asked him to smoke. I suppose smoking while he's sitting right next to me doesn't help.

Flash forward to now. (This is really jumbled, but for reasons I'll get to). Things have definitely been looking up. And I've done it with a constant haze. And I've done it well. Of course I could have put more effort into it, but even before I started smoking I was a procrastinator and super lazy.

But it's gotten to the point that I don't even really like being high. I like the act of smoking and that it gives me an excuse to be lazy. But sitting on the couch watching TV for 6-8 hours every night (not even an exaggeration)

Right now I'm visiting my family in another country. I don't get to see them often

I'm almost at my 2 week mark. The first week wasn't bad. I only really craved it at night, pill-popping family). My sister brought over some used stuff from her vape and I made him some butter (ok, I dipped my finger in the butter to try it, but I didn't get high, so I'm not counting it as breaking my sobriety). He also smoked out of the vape a little bit. And then the vape was just sitting there, next to me, just begging to be smoked. I knew I just had to ask and I would be able to, so A. I didn't want to smoke all of it and not have any for my dad, though and all I can think about it smoking it. 

I don't even know if I want to quit anymore. I've felt myself be more irritable lately, but as I've said before, I've always been lazy. I have work I need to do too, but all I've been doing is browsing Reddit and playing that horrible Candy Crush game on my phone. Like literally, that's ALL I've been doing. 

This has become a horrible rant and I don't even want to post it anymore, they betrayed me (involved lots of vomiting) and I never wanted to touch them again (I do drink beer now, but no hard liquor). So I've pretty much been waiting for that to happen.

So ""don't"" is hard for people. Especially when it involves a habit that has been so entrenched in the mind.

Luckily

It's a mysterious organ, hypnosis, madness, and obviously a lot more.

However, or a shaman to have a strong mind, or to change one's self through the use of that mind.

I will always recommend meditation for people. I won't go into it much here

Now

There are a few stages to quitting, fluctuating until balance is achieved. It can, of course, be done by anybody.

When one decides to quit, it's an art.

You can't ""not smoke."" That's not an activity. It's not something you can do

1: Accounting for the inevitable gaps in time left by abstinence. If you're here

So you have to decide how you're going to spend all your time. All of it. Get a planner or calendar. I use the All-Powerful Google's. Account for meals, legitimate hobbies, and reading. You should be reading books.

The point is that free time is the enemy. Idle hands and all that. It's not your fault that you want to smoke when you're not thinking about anything else (or even when you are!). Your brain has just been conditioned. It needs to be re-conditioned

2: You need to destroy your triggers. Sure, hidden shit at friends' house, gave it away...

Some of those are all good steps to take. The mental environment of the smoker must be broken down. The things that remind you of smoking draw you to the activity itself. Removing things from one's living space (anywhere

But there's a deeper severance you must make. Manipulating the material world to avoid temptation - is that really what you want to do? Look at burkas, smokers, and the like. Do you *want* to join a church? Become a puritan?

Those mental triggers that drive one to smoke must be destroyed. There's a set of actions that you participate in every day: the ritual of smoking. It doesn't start with inhaling, the papers, the bong, the grinder. From there it's an automatic process. You know it's an automatic process.

Isolate this ritual. Explore the mind, don't become angry or fearful or lustful. Don't focus on them: focus on the task at hand. You allocated all your time, didn't you?

I had a bad childhood.  It might not seem so from an outside perspective as it was pretty much clear of specific bad incidents.  My parents are great and always supported me.  However I have social and emotional problems.  I never engaged with people my age (I can remember clearly fewer than 5 friends up to the age of at least 17).  I've tried to forget that part of my life but it probably affected me more than I'd like.  By this point I'd only tried weed a few times.

I'd always liked the idea of pot.  I believed it facilitated philosophical thinking

I was always very intelligent as well.  With stacks of good grades and oodles of confidence I went to a good university.  I'd intended to smoke weed at university

I had moved out of my parent's house to live on campus and found a few friends who helped turn me from ""someone who had smoked"" to ""a smoker"".  I didn't eat well or keep my place clean

But things seemed good because, comfortably socialising and other people actually wanted to talk to me!  We had a guy in our group who had also had social problems.  He hung around with us but nobody ever called him to go out, or asked for his input unless they were doing it to be nice.  None of us disliked him and we all tried to make him welcome, but we struggled to enjoy conversation with him.  I knew that I had been like this and I was proud of how far I'd come (I still am).  I came to realise that weed was treating my social problems!  I was also happier than I had ever been and I thought the pot was helping to treat depression.

At the end of my first year, with my parents, that I couldn't afford to continue staying on campus, and I could look after myself better at home.  So I moved home.

Then (3-4 years ago) the problems really started.  My parents had great difficulty adjusting to me smoking pot.  I was subtle as a rule but we are a close family and things don't go unnoticed.  Living at home

I sat and completed the first year (since I'd learned most of it before) but after that my work dropped.  I had never learned independent study.  I had never needed to, got 3 Fs in my end-of-year exams.  I dropped out.

For the later part of my university life my smoking rose massively.  I can't remember any point between smoking maybe 3g a week and smoking more like 15g a week, I began to take fits of anger and misery when I didn't have smoke, but I blamed it not having money, or being let down by a friend, or whatever circumstance stopped me having weed.  

Cue 3 years of unemployment, possibly the worst job in Scotland and more and more unemployment and depression.  Smoking throughout.  Couple of attempts to quit ended in huge (irrelevant) arguments or inability to be around people, which gave me an excuse to go and buy more.

Then. about 6 months ago, it pays minimum wage and I get up at 3.30am to go there.  And I hope you'll forgive this bit of arrogance when I say that the job is below me.  I'm quite capable of handling pages of schematics and calculations (or I was, and could be again) but I'm packing food for rich folks with no chance to advance.

And that's where I am

The problem is I still don't feel able to function properly without weed.  I can now handle days or weeks at a time (which is a helluva step up from where I have been) but only knowing that I can/will get weed gets me through.  

When I stop smoking, frustrated and worried.  I don't like people and they don't like me.  When I am smoking I am who I should be.  I'm calm, pleasant, abiding and, frankly, happy.

I want to believe in a future where I can be happy, and I still feel I'm treating depression and social anxiety with it.

Right now I'm day 1 clean and I don't plan to pick up soon

I'm literally searching for reasons to smoke all the time.  ""My parents will be out for a few days."", ""Work is too hard."", ""Work is too easy."", ""I have extra money."", ""There's a new film/TV show I want to see."" (I struggle to keep my eyes on the TV without becoming uncomfortable around people, or frustrated with the show, or myself

I don't know if I'm ready to ask for help, I'm just not *asking* because the only way I could make up for your kindness would be to quit, and I just can't promise that.

**TL:DR:**  On top of the world starting my life.  5 years later I'm no further forward.  Smoking is a problem but I also use it as a solution to other problems.

So I guess that's it.  I hope it's ok to leave an introduction post like this.  Hello all.  :)

 This is probably stemming from some sort of psychological problem, and I love drugs too much.  Being addicted to something just gives me one main objective in life (to get high) and it simplifies everything.  I don't have to worry about anything else, as getting high is the only thing that matters. And I LOVE that.  Maybe that's my problem(well obviously it is).

1364280261.0,1b11wl,Another weaning update,MadDogTannen,15,4,25,"I've been [weaning](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1aj1oi/my_plan_for_quitting_this_summer/) myself from weed for a little over a week.  Here's another update.

Even with minor withdrawals from how much I was smoking, which is the stage of the weaning process I've been on for the past few days.  I was taking an AVB pill before bed, but I recently cut that out, and I definitely feel it in that I'm jonesing for my noon bowl a lot more.  Tomorrow, I won't smoke before 5PM, so this may be where things get challenging.  Other than that, this has been a pretty smooth process.

Here are some reflections about my relationship with weed that this process has given me:

* Previously

* As well as I thought I focused on weed

* My tolerance is already adjusted.  Instead of maintaining a constant haze

* Boredom is the enemy.  Over the weekend I had a bit more downtime than I've previously had since I started weaning

* I'm down from about 6-10 bowls per day to 2 bowls per day without any significant withdrawals or tests to my willpower.  In that time, hosted a dinner party with my wife, set up 2 separate jam sessions with some different musicians I know, and never really hit a breaking point (rare for me because I'm a high strung guy).  Knowing I'd be able to unwind with a bowl in X hours always made it ok for me compared to those times when I've pushed myself to the brink going cold turkey and broke down over little things like traffic.  

I think willpower is like a muscle, building up your miles until you can run the 26 miles or whatever distance a marathon is.  I think going cold turkey is like trying to run that marathon without training, and weaning is like coming up with a training program to get you to your goal.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1b11wl/another_weaning_update/

I look back and I wonder where the last two years went.

I dropped out of college summer of 2010. Its winter 2012 now and all I've been doing every day for the last two years is working

I entertain thoughts of quitting and saving up for something but my families financial situation has got me hopelessly trying to run from the reality that we live paycheck to paycheck and I failed to get a good enough job to support my family

Now its like I'm in total denial of the fact that the fuse is burning out and all I'm doing is wasting gas and burning trees

I don't know what I want to do with my life

I like to tell myself that with my addictive personality if I can get into something I'll get really good at it

Lifting has kept me sane. I've dropped a lot of fat and put on a lot of muscle and I've been getting a lot of positive feedback from my loved ones

I spend most of my time alone. Relationships feel like a burden to me... always having to manage other peoples emotions when I can barely manage my own.

Much more simple to burn a bowl

I get lonely and horny from time to time. Porn helps a lot. I spend a lot of nights wondering ""why""... I find myself having the same thoughts as I've had months or weeks ago repeating themselves like beating a dead horse

It's all coming to a crash and burn. When I'm not high I entertain suicide... but if my psychedelic experiences have taught me anything its that life throws curveballs at you to keep things interesting but I can't help but not give a shit about planning for the future or really more than two weeks in advance...

It's strange to feel a plant take over your life to feed off of your life force by being incinerated and inhaled

But weed tends to keep me in the present able to enjoy the little things and hide from the tremendous stress of being a pothead dropout with no financial backings to support his waitress mom and highschool kid brother

I guess I'm just in denial. About everything. About being human and human needs like companionship and community and hard work and success. In denial of even being real sometimes.

I always hope to the universe before I go to bed at night that I won't wake up.

Or that I will wake up in a permanent lucid dream where I control my life and experiences and get to enjoy the best reality that could possibly happen...

But I always wake up, same storyline as usual... and go to work. The weeks keep going by. The paychecks keep coming. The bowls keep burning and the bank account stays empty.

Aside from taking two weeks off

* Health - During my depression during my freshman spring-sophomore fall, the weed contributes to a lethargic and sedentary lifestyle which causes severe changes in weight (both loss and gain).   

* Personal Finances - I used to be frugal and had the ability to budget my expenses so that I had money to enjoy the weekend with my friends. Now if I have 60 dollars

* friendships - As I stated earlier

* Love Life - When I was in high school I had two long term relationships with girls I still adore. My freshman year of college I did very well (as I was not smoking all that heavily). Since then, but after a few occasions where I did put myself out there, i've found it was still easy as hell to get laid, I was just a paranoid, anxious stoner. 

* Cognition - As I said earlier, when i'm really fucked up, like 4th time i've smoked in the past two hours fucked up, I just trail off mid sentence.

To sum up my situation...

I'm 28 years old.  I've been smoking since I was 16, putting the incident on my criminal record. 

I spent the next few years partying with my friends and not really thinking about my education.  I finally got around to getting my GED once I turned 19 and I didn't really think about my future after that.  I had a great time

I started falling out with my pothead friends.  Around this time is when I started hiding the fact that I smoked from a lot of people that I recently met.  Then I came across my now ex fiancee.  Things between us where great for a while

The highs started to make me depressed, I wasn't wasting 12 hours a day playing video games, hoping for some magical thing to come around and change my life.  I was able to finally talk and connect with my family again.  When I was a heavy smoker I often went out of my way to avoid them since we had very different views on my habits. I also started to worry about my future and I started gaining some interest in furthering my education. 

That was 2 years ago.  After about 6 months of being clean I started hanging out with my old crew again. I thought I had developed the will power to say no.   Unfortunately that wasn't the case. I started smoking shortly after we started hanging out again.  It started out as a social thing when we were out at the bar

Since then I've spent the past 2 years as a hermit, I feel like working my dead end job for 9 bucks an hour is acceptable for someone my age.  I spend my days off sleeping for 12-16 hours more often than not. I haven't hung out with anyone aside from swinging by my best friend/dealers house to grab a bag for a few minutes. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I keep telling myself that tomorrow will be the day, when most of them haven't tried or were never heavy smokers to begin with.  

I'm sorry if this is a bit long.  I don't really have any support. I keep telling myself that tomorrow will be the day I call the doctor and get myself back on my prescription meds




TL;DR:
Smoking pot ruined nearly every aspect of my life.  I was able to quit for 6 months but I relapsed and now I'm even worse than I was before I quit and I can't stop procrastinating.

1349593636.0,112vpx,"Heavy user here, 4 days clean, need advice.",time2quitnow,15,19, and I just think it is time to cut back significantly.  I was in college and smoked a ton my last 2 years and it had dramatically negative affects on my grades because I had no self control.  I was constantly around people who smoked and could never say no.  All of my friends smoked

I have now moved back home, that is why I quit.  The first few days were hard, like...fuck me i cant take a step without thinking about wanting to text my dealers.  So I did text my dealers, and guess what they were all out of town (A blessing in disguise).  Now on day 4 I am finally getting over the feeling of NEEDING to get high and it feels really damn good.  Here is where my problem is...I still have all of these friends back at school (My house is only a half hour away from campus) and they are always calling me to chill and I know that will always lead to smoking.  I really want to hang out with my friends but I know if I do, I will not be able to control myself and I will start this cycle all over again.  I also want to know if anyone has found a way to make themselves only smoke only once or twice a month because I would be completely ok with that.  Right now, weed is making me lazy and making me overlook the responsibilities I have, and I want that to stop.  Any advice on how to stay clean/how to force yourself to smoke occasionally would be greatly appreciated.  Also,,False,t3_112vpx
1349398669.0,10yvbf,My leaves introduction (slightly geared towards students),trawlinimnottrawlin,14,3,9,"This started out as a response to a leaves post, and nothing compares to the feeling of realizing that people have gone through exactly what you're going through. So here's my contribution I guess:

I'm 21 years old right now, girlfriends, classes, errands, commitments, etc. I hit my first bong rip at 16, but I only smoked occasionally in high school. I think at most, my junior year of high school, APUSH. Wow

When I got into college, but it's true. To cope, I'd just smoke a little more, chill out. I'd still get most of my homework done, but it started getting harder to go to class. I'd miss a few due dates, fudge a few problems on some sets, but for the most part everything seemed fine. Then the midterm would come, and I'd do mediocre/okay.  But what it comes down to is that I don't have goals right now. I'm very uneasy about it right now... but I didn't even realize I didn't have goals until I stopped smoking this *Tuesday*. This is so huge, that I won't hate it. I'm lost right now

The happiest people I know at school are those who are on top of their shit, and become confident when this results in success. I haven't been focused, fulfilled, or confident for the last three years. I can't truly describe myself as happy anymore, although that was probably what I was most known for being before college. I thought MJ made me happy, but if you're here you probably know that it's not true happiness. 

I wish you all the best of luck in your leaves endeavors, with the average length of weed sobriety lasting like two months. These posts are all helping me get through this, and I hope I've contributed a little bit too :). 

**tl, and I now am finally clearheaded enough to realize I have absolutely no idea what the fuck I've been doing and have wasted the last three years. I've never wanted to help people make this decision as much as I do now, so please quit/moderate smoking if you really want to be happy and take advantage of being alive :)**",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10yvbf/my_leaves_introduction_slightly_geared_towards/

They left for a weeklong vacation today

I've been sleeping a lot

Even with all the laxatives and stool softeners I was pretty stuffed up. Today I put on a glove, although it is bleeding more due to me poking around in there. I think it was necessary, though.

Yesterday I vomited due to the painkillers. I know that weed would help me right now, but I'm not as tempted as I thought I would be. My motivation is to not be a disappointment. I know how a lot of people would be disappointed in me if I fucked up, so I just keep reminding myself that.

I feel foggy
