*10.  Forget about what you don't have

Every woman has something absolutely fucking spectacular about themselves, great boobs, gorgeous eyes, or luscious, full lips.  You've probably been complemented on *something* about yourself.  Run with it.  Show it off.  Own it.  If you own what you do have, it'll become even sexier to me.  You can't change what you don't have, so stop whining about and work with what you have.  No one likes a whiner.  

*9. Stop telling me what you don't have*

This is especially true if you're already in a relationship.  Hey, I'll start thinking about them, too.  Why the hell would you want that?  If you absolutely must think about what's wrong with you, keep it to yourself because I think you're perfect.

*8. Stop making me look like an asshole and take a compliment*

If I give you a compliment on your dress and your response is ""Ugh, ""Thank you!  That means a lot!""  If all you can eke out is ""Thanks,"" then that's fine, too.  

*7. Stop asking for the truth so damn much*

Hey, though, what the hell is so great about the truth?  We all have our ugly moments, we don't need to shine a spotlight on them.  Let's go back to the dress analogy.  If you ask me if a dress you have still looks good on you, I'm going to say, ""Hell yes.""  You already *know* if I'm lying or not, so at least you know I care enough to lie to you.  

*6. Date some jerks

Dating morons is the key component of your late teens and 20's.  It's an important part of dating because it helps you figure out what you want, then just admit that you like jerks.  There are lots of nice guys out there waiting for a girl who wants to date them.  Yeah, they don't have the bite that dating a jerk has, but you're not 14 anymore.  Grow up.  

*5.  Girls who fake orgasms deserve to have to fake orgasms*

If you're dating nice guys (you are now, we know when you're faking an orgasm.  I know you think you're such a great actress but, we get it.  We're not going to point it out if you fake it.  You obviously want to be done with the whole thing and we're not going to drag it out.   Sure, every once in a while, you just want to be done, but if this is a regular thing, you need to figure out what the problem is and let us know.

*4.  Hollywood has screwed you

You've been told that you could be a hooker and a millionaire will come along and fall in love with you and you both will spend the rest of your lives having happy moments on the grass in the park.  You don't want someone to sweep you off your feet

*3.  Watch actions

Words are awesome.  I can use them to talk the panties off a girl faster than a Redditor gets corrected for the proper usage of ""your.""  It's true, then it might be that words are the only thing that he  cares to give you.  Words won't make you honey tea at 4 in the morning because you can't sleep.  Watch what he does and make your decision on his actions.  Not only do they speak louder than words, actions will make you happier than any words ever said.  

*2.  Are you Ms. Right?*

You say no one wants to commit to you but have you ever thought about what you're asking us to commit to?  No one wants to buy a lemon.  If your sole hobby is the ability to post on Reddit and spruce up your Facebook timeline, attractive, fun woman, we're going to commit to her.  Don't be mad at us if we're occupying ourselves with some distractions until she comes along.  

*1. Give us a break*

It seems that our entire society has devolved in to pointing the finger.  Republicans are at fault for this.  Democrats for something else.  Men are evil.  Women are bitches.  You already know that no one wins at the blame game, so maybe you can relax a bit and not point out every faux pas you come across.  We all have cracks in our armor and don't need someone banging on them with a hammer.  Wouldn't you rather have someone to love than to blame?

Is this list perfect?  Nope.  There are exceptions, if you follow these, you'll be a lot farther ahead than most people who have to figure it out later in life (and some of those who never figure it out).

The true meaning of friendzone has been bastardized severely here on Reddit. Being friendzoned is when a girl uses you to cover her insecurities. She'll use you for emotional

When you pursue a girl and she doesn't reciprocate

Imagine a scenario for me. What if a girl (or even a guy) came on to you

You can't really help what you're attracted to, guys tend to get optimistic and try to progress things. It's just less painful for both parties to cut off contact. 

You can't approach women thinking

Yes

It's hard

I tried dating a girl in one of my classes about two years ago (a little while before I started dating my most recent ex), but when it came down to it, she just couldn't. I wasn't her type. She's was attracted to tall husky guys (I'm short and skinny) and it's what she liked. Did I hold it against her? Maybe for a week, but almost two years later, we're still great friends today.

She helped me realize that it's not about making it work with the next girl you meet. It's just about seeing if you two are right for each other.

I've been in 3 LTRs in the past 6 years all of which were longer than a year. So as a nice guy

Yeah, what are they constantly talking about? Most of them are just writing field reports about their humps and dumps. There are a few guys that are looking for more over there, and there is some helpful advice, but the women they are seeking usually don't go for nice guys. I know I look for a relationship as opposed to just sex when I approach a girl.

Unfortunately, but if you look at it as ""we just weren't right for each other"" you'll be much better off. A relationship is between two people. You wouldn't want to be with someone you weren't happy with, and you shouldn't blame women for doing the same. 

Dating can be a terrifying concept. You just have to accept that you're not going to succeed most of the time. I know I can't brag about a phenomenal success rate, and break ups are never fun, but you can't let that stop you either.  

All you can really work on is just being more confident (I know, you're just seeing if she's right for you, not if you can't force things to work.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rrnv7/some_advice_to_all_nice_guys_out_there/

I consider myself a nice guy and a lot of people think you have to be a dick to get the girl. You don't. You just have to learn how to attract them. Women can't just make themselves attracted to you by sheer will power they have to FEEL it, but most females wouldn't be up for sleeping with their male friends. 

Women are attracted to personality and character and who you are as a person

Now, buy her drinks, give her compliments non stop etc... It is totally fine to give your woman compliments, but there comes a point when too much is too much and it just doesn't have meaning anymore. When a woman asks what they'd like to do most guys respond, ""Whatever you want to do."" They're always available for this woman, they'll bend over backwards for her and then they wonder why she doesn't like them. A woman needs a MAN not a BOY.

When you're talking to a woman instead of saying, it comes off as confident. Now obviously your woman has ideas or plans of what she wants to do for the night. ALWAYS listen to your lady and what she wants also, don't be the one making plans all the time. When you're getting a woman's number most guys (including myself I've done this) would say ""Hey can I have your number?"" This is great if you're trying to make a friend, not if you're trying to date this woman, it'll come off as needy. You say, ""I've had a great time with you I have got to get your number so we can set up a date sometime this week."" Most guys think it'd be weird to talk about the date part, it isn't it's exactly what you want isn't it? And if she isn't interested then you save yourself a whole lot of time and anguish by knowing right away you don't have waste your time on her.

 This will be the last thing, ""Hey"", or ""Hey what are you up to?"" Again this is good for friends but it's obvious you were thinking about her before you texted her and you're just trying to build rapport, there isn't any chase in that, you've given her total control over the conversation. Be short and concise in your messages and don't text her just to text, text with a meaning. Text her if you want to meet up with her or even in some cases plan a date, if you just wanna talk with her just call her. It'll come off as more confident.

1320424206.0,m0fg5,The Cheeseburger Theory,TheoreticalFunk,154,17,79,"I responded to a post the other day about this and decided to share it with a wider audience.  This theory has helped me more than any advice I have ever gotten when it comes to dealing with females.  First off

Some notes: A girl is a girl and a boy is a boy.  I'm writing this, but that's outside of the scope of this post.  Also girls are girls until they prove they are women, and boys are boys until they prove they are men.  Got it?  Ok, let's begin.
---------------

She's a girl.  You like her.  You want to talk to her.  You've already fucked up.  

What?  Yes, but this is unlikely.  

Why do douchebags always seem to have girls

If you called one of your buddies and asked if he wanted to hang out on Sunday but he said he was going to Bed Bath and Beyond to pick out curtains with his woman

You like girls.  You also like cheeseburgers. You want them both. There are billions of both out there.  Like girls, on different plates, with different toppings.  The majority of either are going to be satisfying, though some may leave you feeling like you are missing something... so if it were a cheeseburger, you'd try something else, right?

Another scenario.  There is a large platter of cheeseburgers laid out before you and 100 other dudes, you'd just look around and grab another cheeseburger. You'd likely enjoy that second cheeseburger you grabbed. The next day you wouldn't even remember the first cheeseburger.

So... why cheeseburgers?  Cheeseburgers aren't a BIG DEAL.  They are plentiful.  Girls should also not be a BIG DEAL.  They are plentiful.

All this being said

A few thoughts on WHY this works.  First off, you should approach it as ""I'm going to find out if she is worth my time.""

My dating experience has been a disaster. When I have liked a guy in the past I would suddenly lose all of my self-confidence. I let the guy drive the relationship because I didn't want to seem needy. So he set the dates, though I was trying desperately to hide it.

And then one day I just said screw it. If showing interest in someone comes off as needy

So I decided to call a guy when I wanted to talk to him rather than sitting around waiting for him to call me. Suddenly I was no longer chained to the phone

If I wanted to see a guy

This did scare off some guys

And it turns out I found the RIGHT guy by doing this. And I think I found him because I was suddenly comfortable to just be myself.

the next day, only to exchange left over things.  this past weekend, i saw her and her new bf.  no words were exchanged, but a few glances, a smile, and a laugh.  the thing is, i no longer approach women since we broke up.  if i do, but just to compliment them.  i keep everyone of them at a distance

A lot of these misconceptions are subconscious and assumed

As someone who used to be terrible with women, especially younger ones. For reference, I'm 25, average looking, and live in the U.S.

Here are some off the top of my head (some of these you may already know

**1. If I impress a girl

I always see some permutation of the question ""I like this girl. How should I impress her?"" from time to time, so therefore you should think of ways to impress her. 

The reality of this mindset is that by trying to impress her

You don't need to try and impress women to win them over. Just being a guy who is comfortable with himself is enough. When you're talking with a girl, aren't intimidated by them, and don't put them on a pedestal. Ironically, she'll be impressed by this.


**2. If I ask her lots of questions, therefore, like me. **

I feel like guys pick up this misconception from women who say ""Oh I really like [random guy], in common with the 10+ guys she's friendzoned. 

There's nothing wrong with having things in common. But it's not what makes women attracted to you. If you agree with everything she says, she'll see that you're very true to yourself and that she doesn't have an effect on your opinion just because she's a girl.

Asking lots of questions without talking about yourself will make you seem boring, label you as really really boring.

**3. If I'm a gentleman, therefore, start to like me.**

There's nothing wrong with being nice or doing favors. I'm not saying ""be an asshole, or make her like you. If that is your goal, and she isn't already attracted to you, it will make you seem boring, because you're placing her on a pedestal just like every other guy. The closest you'll get is her friendzoning you and using you for your favors, basically taking advantage of you.

The term commonly known as ""nice guy"" (as in ""nice guys finish last"") should really be ""doormat."" There's nothing wrong with being an actual nice guy

Also, but you never know...

**4. If I become her best friend first

Simply put: If you're her best friend


**5. If a girl sleeps with me shortly after meeting me, so therefore I shouldn't go for it, even though I'm attracted to her. I don't want her to think I just want sex.**

My two best

Generally speaking, before you can have sex.

At the same time, because that's all it is. Focus on enjoying yourself, the girl, and the time you're having, and DON'T focus on ""When are we going to have sex?"" 

Also, don't think she isn't interested. If you had a great time and you know she likes you, it'll happen, it's a natural thing.


That's it for now. If I think of any more, I welcome it! Hope this helps!

Guys, is she always there for you 24/7 willing to drop everything just to hang out with you? If she's not doing those things then why should you?

Women want a guy who goes after what he wants. Not somebody who is too scared to tell them they're interested in them more than a friend and blindly throws gifts

When you meet a woman you're interested in, it gets you nowhere. Here's an example, I spot a girl I'd be interested in getting to know and possibly dating. So I'll walk up to her and say ""Hi, listen I think you're really pretty and I'd be kicking myself all day if I didn't come up to you and say something. My name's Alex."" Then shake her hand. Then make sure you at least attempt to get her number somewhere during the conversation.

A guy who just wants to be friends with a girl probably wouldn't say something about how he finds her pretty and he probably wouldn't walk up to her and talk to her out of the blue at all.

So let's assume things go well with this woman, the longer you're going to question yourself and then she's going to think ""Hmm I guess he isn't interested in me anymore."" 

As soon as you think you want to take her out let her know. This part is really important guys

When you ask a girl out tell her it is a date.

""I'm busy Friday but free the rest of the weekend

Unfortunately 98% of the time I never got the girl, she would always wind up dating a guy who wasn't 1/2 as nice as I was to her. 




It took a lot of lost girls to figure out what I was doing wrong in this aspect. I finally realized what was going on. It wasn't that most girls aren't interested in nice guys. It was girls aren't interested in a guy who is a pushover / weenie. My actions of always being there for whatever she needed


What you see when a woman goes for a guy being a dick is a woman who wants to a challenge. She wants the satisfaction of earning a man's attention. Most women don't want everything handed to them, you don't need to turn into a complete asshole to get a girl you wan't. 


You need to start to be your own person. You need to have your own opinions and don't be afraid to express them. When you talk to a girl you like or a girl you think is pretty you need to pretend (even if you don't) you have other options than her and it doesn't matter if she likes you or not. You need to put your world and priorities a head of her. So lets say you are supposed to go out with your friends and some girls asks you to come out with her and her friends. Don't change your plans to hang out with her and her friends. You got your own stuff to do. Don't give women compliments all the time. If it looks like she put some extra time in to getting ready

I apologise in advance because this is kind of loaded and will get lengthy


**Bit of Context**


I live in a small/medium city (~500, been asked out, kissed someone etc. I grew up quite religious (atheist now), and coupled with my asian parents, was always discouraged from dating since I should focus on school etc. I've never had many male friends, and honestly at this point in my life I unfortunately have to say I don't have many close female friends either (I have a lot of FRIENDS, but no one not a single one I could rely on).

I haven't really been interested in getting into a relationship until the last 1-2 years (I've never felt a strong attraction to anyone - to the point of thinking I was asexual in my teenage years). I'm getting older


**About Myself**

I'm well-educated (almost done a Masters in a health-related field), love to travel (have backpacked and worked in an asian country for a couple of months).
But this may be part of the problem: but I'm really not a girly-girl at all. I don't wear make-up, hoodies, and jeans. I keep excellent personal hygiene, I just don't like to dress up like the typical female, it's not me.

Partly due to genetics and partly because of my eating habits (I'm a very picky eater, but I can't - because of this I don't have a curvy bod or... y'know any assets. At all. Girls always like to comment on how skinny I am and I don't think people realize how self-conscious this makes me. Coupled with my dress style and asian ethnicity, I'm usually mistaken for someone quite young (15-20). I've found this leads to pretty self-defeating thoughts, ie. ""Why would anyone want to date me, I'm too small - people want a nice female figure."" and ""Anyone who wants to date me must be a pervert cause I look like I'm a 15-year-old asian schoolgirl."" Stupid, right?

And lastly, I'm worried I'll say the wrong/boring thing. I feel like I have walls up, never really exposing the real me (... I don't even know what the real me is). Having never been in a relationship, I'm afraid of opening up to someone - honestly I don't even know how to. I've tried to see if I could lower my walls a bit with alcohol, but I just get even quieter. I tend to deflect a lot with humour.

A lot of advice I see on reddit in regard to relationships is to work on yourself before trying to find someone. Like don't date someone if you're depressed, but I've been melancholy for years (but people think I'm the most cheerful person in the room!!1!! so it goes.), and my self-esteem isn't run to the ground but it isn't amazing either. Tending towards a lot of self-criticism, if I wait for these issues to completely resolve themselves before I start dating I'd be in my grave.


**The current situation**

I don't know how to meet guys. I don't know how to talk with guys. I don't know what I'm looking for in a guy. I don't know what to watch out for, but I'm not attracted to girls either (I just tend to make friends with them easier). I don't know if it's an issue of having a low sex drive, or if it's because I've never been in a relationship so I don't know what to long for.

I hate parties, I've traveled, I've been in university for seven years now (commuting from home the entire time). It seems like I should be meeting a lot of potential mates, but I never do, there's never any interest. I think this is also the reason I have a lot of transient friends, but not a lot of close ones. I'm excellent at meeting new people, but I have trouble taking any kind of relationship further.

I've considered online dating

Leaving my religion a couple of years ago was emotionally taxing, I feel the whole ""virgin who won't put out for months/years"" will either repel most of the male population, or will attract the wrong types. Self-defeating thoughts again.. Like how the hell do I even bring the subject up? Won't most guys be taken completely aback when I reveal to them that I'm in my mid-twenties and haven't even been on a coffee date?

**And soooo**

I was trying to figure out more to add but typing this up was exhausting. It's so long and random

**TL;DR**

I just want to love

**Edit2**: Holy crap thank you everyone for your thoughtful replies (and surprising lack of creepy pms! I've jinxed it now..). I do really appreciate you offering encouragement and advice. I forgot to mention that something that someone on the original thread said had really struck a chord with me - she mentioned that I may be demisexual, like that's who I am. I hope I don't come off sounding holier-than-thou, but I seriously *very rarely* feel attracted to anyone based on their appearance - I've never had crushes in school growing up, I never lust over movie actors (not even Joseph Gordon Levitt, yeshelooksnice logically but I don't *feel* anything), when I'm hanging out with friends and they get completely distracted cause a 'cute' guy walks by - and then they try to point him out (""look at that cute guy!"") I never know which one they mean though everyone else seems to. I was curious about porn and tried watching it, but it did absolutely nothing for me - I have no idea what the big deal is with it.

So basically what this boils down to is what you've all been saying - work first on making friends. I get that. I make friends easily. But it's taking that initial friendship deeper that I have trouble with (even with same-sex friends).

I taught her standard billiards and nine-ball billiards. We played for about 2.5 hours. We had a lot of great conversation. I let her win 2 games of nine-ball in a row. Then she said that if she beat me a third time I owed her ice cream. We played a standard game and I won. Then we played another nine-ball game and I let her win again. I said that since she won three nine-ball games in a row I still owed her ice cream. She said she would see when she was off work next week and that we would go get ice cream. I paid for the time we were there and walked out with my arm around her shoulders.  
  
Then I said that since I still spanked her so bad at pool she owed me something. She said she couldn't buy me anything (she is pretty broke). Then I put my hands on her hips and told her to kiss me. She hesitated and leaned away slightly but then she came in kissed me on the lips

**Much of the smell is carried by your clothing**. It's surprising how many people are unaware of this. Change your t-shirts every day

Walking up to a random girl and saying 'Damn baby I'd tear that shit up!' rarely works (sadly

But telling a girl something like 'Wow

Cornering a girl and locking her between you and a wall, while just smiling like you're about to drool. O_O

You have to make it natural and almost passive in a sense. 

Turn your attention to her, that you enjoy whatever it is you are complimenting (the smile), and also that you aren't saying it to get something in return (changing focus; turn and say hi to someone or something like that).

I hate texting, or even over the phone, is more 'real', and has a better effect. That being said, using SMS as a tool between real life contact and whatnot can be useful. 

Example: New girl you are talking to. You are at that stage where you can tell you both kind of have a thing for eachother, it's the middle of the week, and you have to keep her interested until you can see her over the weekend and take things a bit further. 

So, you try this awesome move instead. 

You give her some space

Send her this text: ""Hey -girlsname-. I can't really talk right now

Talking to girls is much easier than you think. The only reason so many douchebags get way more girls than normal guys is because normal guys don't bother even trying. You have to try

He came to visit me again and we ended up just having a relaxing afternoon/evening at my place playing video games, we were cuddling and watching a movie as usual, and when the movie ends neither of us really wants to move so we end up chatting for a few minutes. Having challenged myself to kiss him this time, I kept trying to wait for the right moment, but he almost always kept his head turned away from me while we were talking (I'm guessing that was just more comfortable for him). Alas, no such opportunity appeared and I was getting nervous. Finally there was a lull in the conversation and I just flat out asked him in the most playful/flirty manner I could muster ""so are you ever going to kiss me or what?"" And he did. Fuck yes. Nothing fancy, just a good peck on the lips



He is still very shy



Funny side note: We've actually been on another date since he kissed me and it was a very fun day. We went out in the afternoon, but we ended up kind of missing half of each others mouths. I of course thought this was hilarious and laughed. He giggled too, but clearly felt awkward about it. He was turning to leave so, wanting to end the date on a better note, I grabbed his shirt to pull him towards me and giggled saying ""sorry, my aim was a little off. Want to try that again?"" to which he happily obliged :D

I'm asking this because of ""texting"" and ""hanging out"". It seems like a game-changer that's just making dating harder.

I grew up being taught from my parents, that dating is something that happens about once a week, maybe twice a month. The first date would consist of an intimate dinner, which the man would pay for.

Nowadays, as if you were just interested in being platonic friends.

This doesn't sit right with me.

The whole point of asking a woman to dinner

And why are these women always saying they ""would have paid for themselves"" like it was some sort of problem that I did it for them? Is the ""texting and hanging out"" thing so expected that what I'm doing is coming across as ""just being friendly""?

And I've heard a thing or two about ""hanging out"". From what I've heard

From what I've experienced with texting, and people will always assume the most negative meaning that your message could possibly have, and the inescapable intrusiveness of texts seems so clingy. And we're supposed to carry full conversations with this? This all seems horribly detrimental to the progress of a relationship.

Yet these are the expectations that our generation is consecrating. I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy when it comes to this sort of thing

**TL;DR** Is there any hope for guys like me? **Are there women out there who expect a gentleman and won't try to stifle his natural tendency to behave like one?**

I'm probably just like you. I'm an observer; I watch people so closely that I'll feel emotions that aren't my own. I prefer not to be the center of attention

HOW? From an intelligent man to another; its all here for ya

1.Respect. Women are intelligent too -- despite terrabytes of proof against this on facebook. Women are passionate about their own personal goals, or convey your opinion. You step in an elevator -- ""Nice, empty! I get to jump when it reaches my stop and float for a second."" When suddenly, a tall blonde walks in, and presses her stop. Talk to her. ""What's on that floor?"" ""Oh, the Media dep."" ""Is that what you're studying?"" Nothing at this point but genuine intentions.

2.Generate their attraction. Friendliness can only go so far, I want you to lose focus. I want you to hold on to whatever thought is lingering in your head, and accept its presence. This is the essence of cool. You're not concerned with her anymore, and now she has to work to earn your attention.

3.Generate your own attraction. This is probably the hardest, and trying to get you to come back to noticing her. You're established as smart, respectable, and cool. Yay. But the finisher is what makes or breaks you. I want you now to find something about her that you really like. Maybe its her wavy hair, or those lips you want to suck on. Whatever it is, focus on it, get turned on. Soon the silence will sound different; it will become sexual tension between you two. I mean, right?

Respectfully inquire. Than accept the situation, and she's got those glossy eyes, get her number. And ready for this: hanging out with her is the same exact process. Just when you get to step three, make a move.

Hello! So I know I'm young

First off, fashion, etc.) and being confident in your own skin, it's attractive to the opposite sex. The fact that I know deep down that I am doing all that I can to look better is important. I can't stress this enough: in the end looks won't determine your success with men/women. It's difficult for me to say as I'm in high school so people tend to focus on looks, but I am confident that if I show my crush my true personality, that will sway her more than my appearance.

On the topic of crushes, I'm not consciously thinking of girls as I do it. Therefore I shouldn't be so focused on what my crush is doing all the time. Let your crush live their life. If they go on vacation, don't bother them, just let them have fun. This is something I'm still working on but thinking of it in this way helps.

The worst thing about rejection is how you take it. They can laugh, or whatever. If you let it change who you are...then that's the worst thing that can happen.

I asked out a lot of women during my high school years and was rejected in a lot of bad ways. Yet, because I didn't let it get to me. The fact is that some people just aren't attracted to other people...deal with it. You know damn well that there's plenty of people you would reject...and for shallow reasons.

A lot of times people get rejected badly because the person you asked out is completely shocked and not ready for the question. They say what they say simply because they don't know how else to deal with it at the time. I had a woman laugh in my face...but come to me a day later to apologize for doing so. She was really embarrassed...but still didn't want to go out. So make sure you prepare them a little...and don't ask them out in front of their friends or in a place that may be awkward.

Be ready for rejection. Have a line or a plan in place to help the other person let you down. You put them in the position to reject you...so you should at least carry some of the burden relieving the awkwardness. Stay cool...breathe...smile...and thank them for listening. Don't linger too long or try to make further conversation. Most times the worst things are said after the initial ""no"" simply because there's awkward silence and the other person is desperately trying find reasons to make it less awkward. Do it for them. Don't ask for reasons...you don't want to hear them. Just say something like ""Well just so you know

Umair Haque is London-based consultant



Gathered from his twitter page:

1. If you like someone

2. If you ""like"" people purely because of their looks


3. If you're not being yourself on dates


4. ""Rejection"" is a dumb word for a dumb idea. Don't take it personally when you don't click with someone.


5. Don't idealize people. We all have crushes


6. If you can't seem to meet people, shows. Be interesting.


7. If someone doesn't like you back, and people are many.

8. Don't ever (ever) try to convince someone that doesn't like you ""why"" they should. You'll feel worse. Find someone who does.


9. ""Attractiveness"" is a stupid myth. People are drawn to people who bring out the best in them. So be one.


10. You're going to get your heart broken. If you're lucky. So stop protecting

11. Finally, unhappy, break up immediately.



Some other side tweets written by him:

* There's a difference between how a person makes you feel

* Go to the gym. Get a sense of style. Not because society expects it

* Don't ever compare yourself to generic ideals of ""attractiveness"". We are all hot when we have the confidence to see ourselves as so.


* So you have to open yourself to the surprising possibility of people--not just what you ""want"" from them--if you're after love.


* So just find people you really think are cool and interesting and let them know. The more you idealize people

Make a clear, and if resisted put a lot of distance between yourself and the object of your affections. You are basically sending the message, ""As much as I want to be your friend because I value our relationship, I care about you too much in this other way to remain like this, and I chose to validate and honor those feelings even if they are unrequited."" The great thing about this is that it is precisely **not** what a friend-zone prone person does. The classic mistake there boils down to a sort of emotional manipulation, attempting to approach the person on the level of a friend to avoid freaking them out while possessing an ulterior motive. If you doubt my analysis on this, check out these submissions on the matter from [/r/TwoXChromosomes](/r/TwoXChromosomes):

What I'm suggesting might seem like a high risk approach. It is. But it is also the only approach I've actually seen work. If put in a friend zone by someone with respect to whom you most definitely do not want to remain ""just friends, firmly, confidently, and calmly.

**Elements of a Healthy Relationship**

**Clear communication**

* They ask for something when they need it. They don't keep it bottled up inside then explode when their needs are not met.
* They don't expect their partner to have ESP and read their mind.

**Proper Disagreements**

* They can calmly talk about things they disagree about without calling names, or making personal insults.
* They stop discussion if one or more parties is too upset to talk
* Try not to go to bed angry. Resolve the issue before going to bed.

**They admit they are wrong**

* They admit when they are wrong

**Acceptance**

* They accept their partner for who they are and do not try to change them.
* It is unrealistic thinking one person can change their partner. The partner has to do the changing.

**Supportive**

* The person is supportive of the partner in good times and bad.
* The person understands and tries to meet the partner's needs, physically, and otherwise.

Today was our 3rd date. We watched the Super Bowl together with my group of friends. Then we went out to a local dive bar for a drink. I had 2 scotch on rocks. She had 2 double rum and cokes and an Irish Car Bomb. We stayed for about an hour and a half. At the end she asked me back to her place. 

We drove separately and I told her I was going to pick up beer from my place and meet her back at her house. When I get there she shows me her busted window and scraped fender. Her mirror was missing. While I try to get info from her a cop shows up.

I go inside while she makes up BS as to what happened that night. I was not going to volunteer info

She is being arrested and held for OWI. Her car will be towed. He was under the impression I was her BF/fiance. I told him it was our 3rd date and he just laughed. I asked him what I should do.

People also tell me I'm too negative but I don't say negative shit around people when I first meet them at all and they'd probably think shitty about themselves too if girls treated them the way they treat me.

I am trying really hard not to seem desperate when interacting with women, I really am.  I started trying to date over two years ago with no success.

Now, especially from the female side; obviously I only have experience as a man.  ***I'm envisioning this as the start of a conversation

1) **If I messaged you, I'm not looking for okcupid pen pals, and I don't think many guys are--if they keep messaging you without trying to escalate things, they're probably just shy.

2) **I do not have extraordinary expectations for the first date**.  My assumption on the first date is that since we are strangers and have just met, kissing you), but I do not expect intense romantic attraction on the first date, although I expect that we should like each other.  Because we have never really met before, we will likely split the bill.  Personally, I will always offer to pay, but because we haven't met before I will feel a little weird if the girl doesn't at least offer to split (granted

3) **My expectations for romantic attraction are higher for the second date.** We already know each other and the jitters are gone.  Now, I will pay.

4) **If I ask you out for a next date, we're all just trying to figure this stuff out on our own, and it's complicated.  Examples of ""bad"" but interpretable behavior are not answering my calls/blocking my emails/etc.  I'd prefer if you didn't do that, though, so that I can get the message right away instead of leaving a couple voicemails like an idiot.

5) **Sometime within the first couple dates, I won't try to go for sex immediately after kissing you, but depending on how it goes, some guys may.  If I'm unsuccessful in escalating things, I will assume that you're not interested, unless you state some specific reason why you're holding off.  Most guys I know will try to propose sex within the first five dates, with the 3rd being a ""reasonable"" assumption.

6) Regardless of how many dates we go on, personally--if this doesn't happen within a couple months...that's a little odd, and if things don't seem to be going somewhere by two months, I'm going to break it off.  

7) **At any rate, if we've had a discussion about it--I expect that you will show me common courtesy and break up with me (at least via phone call, but preferably in person).

What do I do?,inexperiencedandsad,32,5,17,"TL;DR: super low self-esteem; had a thing with a guy that I hoped would turn into a relationship; put myself out there and got rejected; then learn that the guy and his friend kind of laughed about it while also feeling sorry for me. Am I just the loser that no one has the heart to tell to get lost?

This is really long

Background: 23f

So, but we broke up pretty early in the year. I'm not very social, but after the break up I made a concerted effort to go to events with my classmates from time to time to ward off loneliness and make friends. There was a guy in my class (""Joe"") who I would talk to from time to time at these events, and he was aware of some of my self-esteem issues and would never let me sit for too long by myself at the parties. It was sweet.

Over Christmas break, I wasn't sure what would happen. After the first week of classes, I ended up hanging out with just him and his friend (another classmate, ""Sam""); after Sam went to sleep, Joe and I ended up kissing and making out for a bit. He was quite drunk. The next day he brought it up and we talked a bit about it; he said it shouldn't happen again because he didn't think it was a good idea to date. I was disappointed because it was fun, but whatever. Then, though, we would end up back at my apartment. After a couple months

We didn't have another discussion about what was going on, but kept hoping it would escalate at some point to a relationship. As the end of the semester neared, I realized that probably, if he were going to ask me out, it would have happened. But exams ended and he stuck around a few days, and we spent most of that time together. Things felt right and happy, and yet we still didn't talk about ""us."" Then he left, and he turned me down. It was the sweetest rejection

I cried over it for about 15 minutes shortly after the rejection, and have continued talking to him multiple times a day. He knows how depressed I am, and what low self-esteem I have, and I haven't really been hiding that from him too much, although I've been trying not to overload on it, because I do think he felt bad about hurting my feelings; but at the same time, he is a good friend and I am not the type of person to hide what I'm feeling very well.

So I have been dealing with the rejection and trying to move forward, and now I m doubting everything that happened with Joe, my whole place among my circle of friends, and basically my general worth as a person.

Essentially, and asked me to read it to him. I did so, and it was from Joe (not about anything substantial). I was curious, though, and scrolled up in the conversation a bit, and saw where they were talking about me. Essentially, Joe told Sam that I had asked him where our relationship was going,"" and Sam laughed about it. It ended with them agreeing not to talk to other people about it. 

I know I shouldn't have looked at the conversation, Joe just kind of felt sorry for me, but also didn't want to turn down the reliable hook up and drunken place to stay. I thought Sam genuinely liked me too, and thought of me as a friend. Were they just kind of shaking their heads the whole time, feeling sorry for me? All of my friends that I hang out with, I got in with by going out with Joe and Sam. I thought all of those people really liked me as well. Now I feel like the whole group just kind of felt sorry for me because they saw me as the loser that I am, and no one had the heart to tell me that I really didn't fit in. I wonder if looking back, and I want to hide in a hole and never see these people again

Today, then I guess I will know that it really was just me forcing these ""friendships"" with people who were too nice to tell the loser to back off. I guess I was just too naive and hopeful, and I learned a hard lesson. What should I do about my friends? How do I keep my head up and hang out with Sam this summer, when I know he knows about my rejection and that he laughed about it? How do I recover from this?

1315494637.0,k8voj,Let me give you some tips on how to approach attractive girls,cI_-__-_Io,36,9,13,"I wrote this last year for 4chan

&gt;I've spent the last weekend with a girl who some of us would call a perfect 9. (if you are shallow enough to rate girls). She's 18, tanned, but not at all the californian Barbie Playboy type, she's a natural beauty with a gorgeous, jaw-dropping natural body, and a cute/childish face.
&gt;
&gt;I've learned a lot this weekend. I learned how you see the world when you're an attractive 18-ish girl (I'm a 24 male), and I'll try to share most of my experience with you.
&gt;
&gt;My ex-girlfriend (who was a 7 at best) used to tell me how many guys tried to flirt with her
&gt;
&gt;Even a mildly attractive girl
&gt;
&gt;Typical reactions from the guys:
&gt;
&gt;* staring at her from a distance (mostly face)
&gt;* staring at her breasts
&gt;* turning back to look at her ass
&gt;* saying shit like ""wow"" or ""damn""
&gt;* saying random words without really talking to her just to get her attention
&gt;* starting to walk beside her and to engage in a semi-conversation (creepy)
&gt;* if she's sitting
&gt;
&gt;She gets approached at the very least twice an hour.
&gt;Don't think guys are smart enough to have any class when they try to get her attention. Most of the guys are just completely rude.
&gt;
&gt;When she's approched:
&gt;
&gt;* if she's walking, think at when you're walking close to a hobo and he tells you ""please, sir!"". Imagine a whole day with thousand of hobos trying to get your attention. You get the picture.
&gt;
&gt;* if she reacts negatively (even a ""no thanks""), because whenever there's a guy around her, their balls seem to shrink a lot). So she just ignores them.
&gt;
&gt;* now this is interesting, not as a danger (not arrogant, not clingy), even if she doesn't like you, she won't put you off in the first minutes. Just be friendly and smooth, if you don't know where to start, ask her what she's doing right now, you'll get something to start with. If you're attractive and funny enough
&gt;
&gt;Now if she rejects you right away (almost never happens) it just means that she's busy doing something else or not in the mood (she's not necessarily a bitch, enjoy it and don't be disappointed if you don't get anything else. Don't start with a goal in mind, just do it for the sake of the conversation.
&gt;
&gt;The bottom line is that the nerdy guy who doesn't have the gut to speak to her will never, and things like that. We also talked about litterature, painting (she's studying arts), and more serious stuff, she's a lot deeper than you would think.
&gt;
&gt;And it makes her sad because
&gt;Yup
&gt;Because, they won't go through the trouble of talking to you.

A few weeks ago

After looking around, but only got a ""I just want to be a better friend"" response.

Oh. Grand... Rejection number oh-I-forget-the-amount-of-times-I-have-been-rejected... an exaggeration

So weeks passed, blah blah blah.

I merely disregard it. After all

Another week passes and I keep talking to her. She's a friend from sophomore year

About 3-4 days ago (Depends on if you count today.) I make a bold move to ask her out. Via text. Normally my brain would stop me

She merely replied in a text ""(: yes"" and I merely stopped.

My brain at first almost didn't accept the information. Had she been playing a cruel joke? No. She apparently wasn't.

Thanks to advice I remembered from you bunch on /r/dating_advice

He talked about all the things he could do for me like cooking and taking me out again, ""What else is there to know? I think you know the basics, but I understand."" I asked him more personal questions and I'm questioning to myself if this is normally how first dates work. The movie ends. 

He asked if I wanted to do anything after. I thought he realized that I wasn't looking for something physical and thought he might've just wanted to talk more so I said sure. We went to a gas station to get some sodas and in the station he's rubbing up against me and then he leaned in to kiss me again. This time I kissed back for a split second and then told him that it was inappropriate to do in a gas station so we left. I was going to drop him back off at his car to maybe talk before he left. 

As soon as I parked he learned in to kiss me again. I tried to back away

I have close friends, but there's always been something preventing it.  In my new location, I haven't really gotten too close to anyone, except work friends that I sometimes go out to dinner with in the evenings.  More recently, I've put a little effort into my look, bought nicer clothes, kept up my general appearances.  About a year ago, and I have a routine at home that I do several times a week

I even tried hanging out in more social places.  I go to local concerts, and I'm extremely uncomfortable acting that way.  I can't really get myself to go up to women cold, and start a conversation.  I tried once going to a bar alone, and just forced myself to talk to people.  It was one of the most awkward experiences of my life, and I haven't really recovered enough to try again since. 

I tried online dating, sensible advice for how to do so.  I get very few replies though, and none of them have led to dates.  I think I get filtered out a lot of searches or replies, since I am short (5'5"") and somewhat losing my hair.  I feel completely demoralized by this approach, and I don't think I have it in me to try another year of the online sites, and be disappointed week after week.

I just don't really know what to do now.  I'm started to get really lonely and depressed on the weekends.  I know I could force myself to keep trying.  In the beginning I was so sure that things would work out, well-adjusted, nice guy.  And then the failures kept piling on, month after month.  It's gotten to the point where I've begun to spend my evenings alone at home, feeling sorry for myself.

I'm a 22 y/o female who's been a vegetarian since childhood (about 17 years now). I eat dairy products and eggs, exc. Most of my family and all of my friends are not vegetarian, so I'm not preachy about my lifestyle choice nor do I care if other people eat meat, I am not bothered by it in any way.
I'm not a picky eater aside from the vegetarian thing. I will taste and try anything and I tend to have a very spicy and flavorful pallet. I love going out and trying new restaurants.

Problem:
I'm finding that the vegetarianism is a major turn off for guys. We'll go out to dinner or lunch at a restaurant or something and we'll order food, the vegetarian thing will come up.

The mention of me being a vegetarian is usually followed by something along the line of ""oh I'm sorry

Typically I wish the conversation would end at this but guys tend to latch on to the veggie thing. I get questions of ""why are you a vegetarian?""

I always answer all the questions to the best of my ability and neutrally

We can have a great date

tl;dr: my vegetarian lifestyle is turning off the guys I'm dating. Looking for some advice. 


Edit:

Thanks for all the insightful inputs. Many were actually very thoughtful and helpful. Some people made good points about the two separate meals. I guess this never really occurred to me because my family has just been doing this for so long its just kind of automatic. Spaghetti night: one pot with meat, veggies, I'll have the same veggies and potatoes and fry up some tofu instead. Its not really like two separate meals, just kind of like a substitution. But I can see if you hadn't grown up like that how this would seem like a lot of work. I typically avoid eating at friends' houses, with the exception of my very best friend who has known me for years, for that reason.

I wouldn't want to limit myself to just dating vegetarians. I've actually had a couple good relationships with non-vegetarians that ended for different reasons. I was just looking more for a first thought opinion

As for the reason I am a vegetarian, I promise you don't have to defend your omnivore diet, so why care about what I eat?) . If someone wants to discuss it and is interested, I'm totally cool. Its when I get comments like ""well plants are technically living too you know.."", ""We are higher on the food chain and meant to eat them"", ""we have canine teeth so we're meant to eat meat"", ""why are animals more important to you than the overall well being of humans "" ex that I get frustrated (and yes I have heard each and every one of those).

You can open your heart to someone but only if they are a good match. In order to know this it takes time to know them. 

Make 2 lists. These are the deal breakers.

1. Things your partner MUST have
2. Things your partner MUST NOT have (like an addiction). 

Your partner should meet everything in list 1, move on. There should be no more than 3-4 things on each list. If there are more, you might be too picky or unrealistic. 

Talk about the MUST HAVE items on your first date

Talk about moving in together when you want. But don't do it before dating for a year. 

NEVER put both people on a lease unless you are married. If things go bad and one has to leave

The most common topics couples fight about. Have a serious talk about these within the first 3 dates!

1. Kids. Do you want them? How many? How soon? 
2. Money. Are you a saver or spender? What about your partner? Will you have combined accounts or not? 
3. House. Buy new or used? Spend how much? Buy it how soon? This topic sort of falls under ""money"" and how to spend it.
4. Sex. How often do you need sex? What will you compromise on? What kinks do you and your partner have? 
5. Marriage. Do both of you want to get married or just be committed? 

**Communication is important.**

If a person cannot communicate what they want

A person with poor communication skills may not know what they want, but not for anything long-term.


**Problems**

Some problems in a relationship can impact many facets of the relationship. A relationship involves 2 people


**Insecurities**

Some people tend to be insecure by nature or by events they experience while growing up. The symptoms might include: frequent fights about small issues, someone wanting to micromanage another person's life, etc.


**Maturity**

Older people tend to be more mature and better at communication, those who have not learned from their mistakes, can be very immature. 


**Emotional baggage**

""Emotional Baggage"" is a term I use for issues that a person is very sensitive about. Maybe a person is not ready to say ""I love you"". Maybe they are not mature enough to understand or accept it. Maybe something bad happened when they were a kid and they abhor confrontation. They view talking about any delicate issue as a confrontation. Maybe they were sexually abused


**Mental illness**

Mental illness, and therefore, relationships. The trick is to recognize mental illness from just plain bad behavior. Because mental illness can cause bad behavior, bad thinking, and bad choices. Medications often help as do psychotherapy. But one cannot for a legal adult into either. The choice is theirs to fix themselves or not. 

This can be a painful issue if the person believes there is nothing wrong with them or refuses treatment

**Compatibility**

A relationship works better if the two people have compatibility on which to form a relationship. They should have things in common such as: 

* Politics
* Religion
* How they spend free time
* Views on life. 

**Attraction**

Of course attraction is part of the deal. There is mental attraction, or if you can live with it. 


**Love**

As you get to know someone

* Your love will not change the person's bad habits. They have to want to change and want to do the work. 
* Your love will not change the incompatibility between you two. That is a fundamental thing that is mostly unchangeable.

Ok

One girl I went out with a few weeks before valentines day.. I'll call her Lisa (36F). Lisa and I had been flirting on and off for several months prior, I agreed to having a dinner and we met at a restaurant halfway between both our places. She was very attractive but the conversation was off but interesting. She seemed harmless enough and asked if she could go back to my place. She followed me to my pad and we watched a movie for a bit before the flirting began and we wound up making out. Things got a little heavy but we did not have sex. I just wanted to make that point. I said we should cool down, we finished the movie and the evening ended on a friendly note. 

within a couple of days, etc. I thought it a bit presumptuous so I told her I wasn't making any plans for valentines. Well, she got upset and we argued. I wound up deleting her and her friends from my facebook. A couple weeks passed and she contacted me to apologize so we talked a bit and I agreed to be friends. I re-added her on FB and she went out to a few of my shows.

At the shows, I asked her not to but she seemed harmless) and then after a few minutes would go away until she came to say bye at the end of the show. I didn't think it was a big deal. We never saw each other for a date, never did anything after the events and never talked on the phone. Just FB texts and her saying Hi/Bye at shows.

So, she was gorgeous, smart, funny and literally swept me off my feet. One thing led to another and before I knew it we had spent the whole weekend together. Word got out to Lisa that I had spent the weekend with Cindy and Lisa totally flipped out. She messaged everyone of my friends she could get a hold of and started posting on my wall about how I was a player and an ass. She accused me of dating multiple women (keep in mind, I only knew Cindy for 3 days), using and abusing women and hinting that I was spreading STDs. Pretty much anything she could come up with. She blocked me but not before messaging every woman she could find on my FB page. 

Of course, well, as far as I know she's the only one who dislikes me.

The kicker is she sent a couple of threats to Cindy and even though I explained the situation

 I logged into my OKC account and noticed she's been visiting it. 
 She's shown up to a couple of our events and just stands there watching me.

So, I don't know how to deal with her.

How do I handle this? It's completely stressing me out and wrecked what I felt could have been the start to a great relationship.  I have no direct proof that these new anonymous emails are hers. She's not threatening me at these shows so I can't have security kick her out. She hasn't threatened me directly

As the title says, or even hugged one that I can remember. Yes, I used to be the creepy, weird, smelly 300+ lb obese video game nerd. I'm over that, I lost over 100 lbs and train obsessively for my sport. I don't think looks are the problem any more. I can post pics if someone wants.

I feel like I never really get a chance to meet girls. I'm in college, so I'm not a shut-in. I'm either in class, in the library studying/reading, at work, or training.

I've approached many girls in the library, but I can tell when I call that they're not very excited to hear from me, and it never leads to anything.

I was really into this one girl at work. Saw her sitting in the dining hall alone a couple weeks ago, but she has a boyfriend.

The gym is my main source of friends and where I do most of my social interacting, so there's no help there.

I'm not nervous at all about approaching anyone. My confidence is at an all-time high. I'm a weird combination of a quiet, no one else seems to.

I guess I'm supposed to be going to parties/concerts or bars or something. I don't find the whole college party atmosphere very appealing. I do really enjoy sitting at a bar and talking to people

4 dates with the guy (33/m) in question. I had to break it off. His 1 bedroom apartment was a disaster (he lived alone). I am a professionally creative person, a LOT of dust everywhere, tons of books, the counters were filthy, the bathroom was just gross (how does the bottom of a bathtub get to be black?), I couldn't even concentrate on a conversation with him while standing in his apartment. 

I gave him the benefit of the doubt regarding his space (while dating), but I didn't feel comfortable (read: not unsafe) just not 'at ease' while there.

Have you dealt with this? Initially my decision felt petty

The alternative suggestions are to just not meet/visit his place, so inevitably, we'd end up hanging out there. And since we were only a few dates in, it didn't seem like my place to say anything about it. He is clearly comfortable living in his space, and while it's not for me to judge, I just couldn't deal with it any longer.

We have spoken about the topic of sex and have had numerous counts of phone sex but have not yet done the physical deed. We had planned to make it a memorable first time together during a date.

Things have been getting strong between us to the point where we both like and trust each other immensely
Earlier today she sent me a text saying she has something deeply personal and important to tell me before I went to bed tonight. So

She felt that it was unfair for her to have contracted such a STI unwillingly and felt it only fair that I know before we did anything serious. She knows that I take pride in being clean and I told her that I respected the fact that she showed me great care

She told me that she wanted me to know before we did the nasty because she cared for me enough to want me to have the logical choice as to whether I want to continue things or not.

She has

She has let me go for a few days so I can mull it over and get back to her.

I am, My emotions tell me that I really like this girl and would like a future with said girl as she has been and is just fantastic to me. My logical mind tells me that even if I use a condom with this girl I still stand a chance of catching herpes, which I don't like because I have experienced condoms that break mid cloitus and I have a pride in being clean. And even if I did chose to stay with her and use condoms, things may get serious in the long run and the talk of procreation may arise, meaning I would need to bite the dust and get Herpes. But that is just a possibly crazy long term thought, but still a thought nonetheless.

So
Please feel free to ask me any questions about this as long as they are not overly personal and can be used to identify us.

A couple days ago it was unseasonably warm out during the evening, a girl who I'll refer to as Sarah. I hadn't seen Sarah in a few weeks and always got along well with her, she and I had even worked together on the artwork for a small publication I was writing (I won't get into that). So, I asked her to get a drink with me and, quite frankly, to my surprise she said yes.

We went on to have a really good night. We went back and forth hardly able to believe we were into some of the same things (we're both interested in the histories of serial killers and actually share the same favorite, things were going well!  However, one drink turned into several and she invited me back to her apartment. 

Obviously I agreed to go back with her, or thought as the case may be, really highly of Sarah and I was legitimately interested in perusing something with her, so I was a little hesitant to rush things. I digress; We went back to her apartment, wherein we laid down on her bed, made out for a few minutes and then she passed out.

**perfectly understandable** it was like, as well. She then continued to stare at me for a few moments in total silence, which prompted me to ask if she was all right?

From there she told me that she was really hung over and didn't want to hang out right then and I offhandedly mentioned that nothing happened during the night. Confused, which was also ignored. Now I'm just keeping my mouth shut, I figure any more attempts to get in touch would just annoy her.

This makes the third time this basic situation has happened to me. I've run through that night/morning one hundred times in my head. I really liked this girl

To boil down my question(s); Is this something that... just happens sometimes? Is Sarah completely insane or am I completely oblivious

Turns out we can't figure out how we know each other but there was instant intense attraction, lots of touching, she was actually holding my hand while we talked and the other guys she had been getting attention from were staring us down. 

We talked about how we should hang out some time but never got her number because I found out she's good friends with a close friend of mine and she said she'd get us to all hang out soon. I told her about a show going on the next day she should come to. She shows up and it's instantly the same thing, very obvious that we're interested in each other. 2 days later I get a call from my friend that he's hanging out with her and I should come by. I come over and everything is just going so perfectly. I'm on it. She's very receptive. We figure out so many things we have in common. She's like glowing. Then my friend goes to sleep and she tells me she can't stop thinking about me, jumps me, we end up making out and rolling around in the grass for a while, take her back to my place, tell her I don't want to have sex with her because I don't want things to move to quick but I'd love to cuddle. We go back and cuddle and kiss for hours, looking into each others eyes, wake up 4ish hours later and kiss and snuggle for another few hours. Drop her off the next morning and went to work really late with about 4 hours sleep.

I purposefully didn't get her number so that she'd have to make the next move of calling our mutual friend and getting him to call me. Also

She said that I'm the best kisser she's ever been with, only when the moment seems really perfect, because I don't want to mess anything up, we need to be mature about this and sex can make things complicated."" was one of the coolest things a guy has ever said to her. I haven't talked to her since I dropped her off Tuesday morning, where she clumsily stumbled out of my car in some sort of love-stricken daze because she was looking back at me. Can't wait to see her again. Can't believe I've handled it so well so far, gotta keep at it though. I guess it's important for me to use this down time between interacting with her to really ask myself the question do I want to get into something really serious right now? Because that's the path we seem to be on.

But it just so happened that we ended up living in the same town recently, and I just never really saw an opportunity with her. When we started hangout out again, I noticed I still thought the same way about her. I had plans on telling her how I felt, but something came up that knocked me flat on my ass, testicular cancer. 

At some point before my nut was removed, being very supportive, and even taking care of me after my surgery because I was more or less bed ridden for a few days. Now, due to the fact that my blood test show high levels of tumor markers(scans show no masses, thankfully), I need to go through one to two rounds of Chemo. 

Now this whole cancer thing has been a giant monkey on my back from my perspective. I want to let her know how I feel, for I have never really been a worry wort when dealing with the opposite sex, but I feel like my current state of mind is clouding my judgement. Is this a foolish train of thought? Should I just ignore the giant elephant in the room and tell her how I feel?

So I took the advice of a few redditors and finally took her out to a REAL date. Saturday night, the ""shabang"". We texted throughout the week, mainly about logistics, but some about what was ""up"" or how things were going. 

Saturday night I pick her up and the car ride over is mainly talk of the easiest way to get where we were going. Not too bad though. We're seated as soon as we get there (reservations ftw) and when we sit down, or some follow-up, and she'd give me the minimum. Dinner lasted less than 35 minutes thanks to how fast Olive Garden serves you and what little conversation we had. 

After the date, barely scratching the surface of any real conversation. I eventually get the courage to hold her hand. I don't know if this is typical but I'm used to hand-holding closer to the body. My hand in hers is right next to my hip and she extended her elbow so there were still a few good inches between us. This, along with zero conversation, makes me feel like the date is going south. We get in the car and I ask if she'd like to do anything else (I honestly thought those two things would take a couple of hours on a good date) and she says that she should probably go home. 

I take her back to her place and this is the final test: the goodnight kiss. My prospects were low but I had to try. We both say we had fine, and she stops me. She says she's unsure of it but that she is flattered I would want to kiss her. Well damn. We say goodnight and our date is over after less than 2 hours. 

Afterwards I went to a friend's St. Patrick's Day party to occupy the rest of my night and around 10 she texts me saying

I've talked to my friend's about this and they think if I feel like it's going nowhere I shouldn't feel so bad but I'm still unsure. Should I keep trying or throw in the towel?

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18uvwp/update_im_24f_never_been_on_a_date_never_been/)

I should have asked you guys for red flags

I don't even know how to explain what happened. Here's a rough timeline:

- we find each other online
- messages get pretty long - ok he likes to talk a lot
- we seem to have a lot in common so we go on a date. Prior to date #1 he's already making plans for future dates
- date went well, see original post for more details). He's a nice funny guy, lots of similar interests though, so I schedule date #2
- between date #1 and date #2, super into me. I'm amazing, I'm awesome, I'm fantastic, we get along so well, he can't wait to hang out again etc. I've never, ever had someone tell me this. So I'm flattered
- date #2 happens. we talk more about shared interests again, says he's totally fine with going slow. Wow, what a good guy.
- And then after a bit more chitchat he's suddenly talking about marriage and kids (half-hypothetically, so I just laugh.
- he says he'll disable his dating profile now that he's met me. I said I would too..
- We take a taxi home and he cuddles a bit. Okay first time I've experienced that, no chemistry. I'm leaning on his shoulder, but getting more and more uneasy. I chalk it up to nerves again, and my own inexperience.
- Get home, and that I'm looking forward to date #3.
- And then the fucking doozy: he replies back saying that the good times won't end! That this is how it will be from now on

**WHAT. THE. FUCK.**

And suddenly all my doubts and anxiety that I chalked up to be inexperienced become validated. He's a nice guy, but he's so desperate. I'm stifled, he's invested too much too early. I'm spooked. And the worst thing is, THE WORST THING IS, I have given him NO INDICATION of my doubts, not a single time over 20+ messages and two dates. I didn't know how, I didn't know how to criticize people, let's see how it goes before planning more dates etc.'

So now what fucking happens? He's out for drinks with his best friend now, it'll be a punch in the gut, it'll fucking break him, he'll think he completely fucked up from the most recent message when in fact it had been a culmination of things I was too naive to see. WHY did he get so invested so early WHY. I hate being mean to nice people. I hate it. I fucking hate it.

Am I doing the right thing? How the hell do I do this?

I recieved some great advice from people in this subreddit and askreddit

I was advised to do many things: talk to my parents, tell her the truth. I like this girl and I definitely didn't want to lie her; she was probably in the same position as me given that she had never been on a date before either. So I decided to email her. 

I told her that I was almost 17 and I was interning at the college for the summer. I told her that I was pretty luck to meet her on the bus and I knew that I would regret it if I didn't ask out a girl as cute and interesting as herself. I also told her that this was the first time I had ever asked a girl out. I mentioned that I was a bit surprised to find that a cute girl like her has never been on a date before. I then told her that I am comfortable with the age difference if she is and that I really meant it when I asked her out. I said that she shouldn't have to skip work to go on a date

She emailed me back later today. She told me her name and that she was 20 years old. She was a bit lighthearted in her email because she included a haha. I'm probably just over analyzing. Anyways, she doesn't think that it will work and that the age difference will be too much. She apologized.

I sent her a reply. I told her that I thought she was a great person and that I was sorry that it couldn't work out. I told her that I completely understand and that I hope that there are no hard or awkward feelings. I apologized for misleading her and anything else. I told her that this was the first time I had asked a girl out and that I got caught up in the moment. I told her that I might see her around campus this summer and I wished her the best.

I personally think that I came on a bit strong in the first email, I'll apologize in person.

TL;DR: I told her the truth in the email and asked if she was still interested. She was 20 years old. She politely declined and apologized for changing her decision. I told her that I completely understood and apologized too. I told that I hope that there are no hard feelings and wished her the best of luck.

1362415481.0,19n8gk,"I(27f) has been dating a guy(32) who has a female best friend. Normally wouldn't bother me, but something happened yesterday. ",secretsssss,22,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/19n8gk/i27f_has_been_dating_a_guy32_who_has_a_female/

I've been seeing this guy (alias: George) for about 3 weeks. We've known each other for over a year and he's liked me for almost as long but I had a boyfriend at the time so nothing happened and we remained friends. Then I broke up with the boyfriend and started dating George (not a causal situation). 

I went over his place yesterday, because the girlfriend happens to be George's best friend. He answered in the negative, but within 2 minutes George's best friend called him and admitted that she was in love with someone other than her current boyfriend. 

Visibly upset,"" ""you know I'm here for you,"" ""do you need me to pick you up,"" etc. He explained to me that they have a brother/sister relationship and that his friends are everything to him. As soon as he got off the phone, I left to give him/them space or whatever (also I have never met the girl before so it would have been awkward of me to be hovering about), and I didn't want to appear not cool about the situation. 

It bugged me for the rest of the night, and I always felt it unfair that I or my guy friends had to be given an ultimatum between a romantic relationship and a much, much longer friendship. But I have never been in a situation where a guy had such an intimate platonic relationship with a woman, so much so that I was constructively kicked out of a date because of it.

Am I being weird? Is this normal? I have no idea. I have no desire to give George such an ultimatum (me or her!) but I would like a little perspective on this. 

TL;DR - guy I'm dating has a crazy intimate relationship with his female best friend and I am weirded out by it. 

**Edit** - to answer some questions and my own comments: 

None of what he has done or said, as most of you have pointed out. As I've said, I have been the female friend to guys before (and currently so) so I know what it's about and I don't resent him for having a best friend who is female. Even more so because it's only been 3 weeks and we're still feeling each other out. 

I was just a little taken aback at an unfamiliar relationship scheme but it honestly at this point is not a huge deal. I guess I needed to vent a little but I get over things quickly. Thanks everyone for their perspectives (as requested)

We'll see where it goes and if it's something I ultimately will be unable to deal with (assuming things like this happen often or starts crossing over into grayer areas)

Just a quick update - thank you reddit

Basically after receiving all of your thoughtful replies and encouragement, etc.). This gave me the push to try something that I have been very VERY apprehensive of stepping foot in - online dating.

Well I made a profile a couple of days ago, I was more nervous for this than I've ever been for any job interview. But after we got settled down the conversation just flowed, he seems like a really great guy, and we seemed to have a lot in common!

We messaged each other after and we both felt the same way - that we got along and enjoyed each other's company, if he could be patient (if anyone has ANY advice as to how to broach this or if it's too early to say this etc. let me know). We didn't have any physical contact on the first date except for a hug goodbye (which I initiated). I just don't want it to suddenly escalate into areas that I'm not used to/comfortable with just yet, or alternatively I don't want him to think that if I seem cold/not physically affectionate that I don't like him.

I have noticed a couple of 'odd' things that suggests to me that he might be quite inexperienced at this as well

But maybe I'm overthinking it (as usual), so thank you again! If you have tips or anything else I should keep in mind at this point, I'm all ears :)

1349206722.0,10tzbp,"I have Asperger's. I want to have a girlfriend but I can't talk to people without making things awkward and I'm pretty sure I make people uncomfortable or even repulsed, especially girls. I can tell I'm doing something wrong but I have no idea what it is.",DepressedAssDude,29,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/10tzbp/i_have_aspergers_i_want_to_have_a_girlfriend_but/

Every time I try to talk to a girl I feel balls-out retarded. I met a girl in band in college in the same section as me and she's really cute and likes all the same shitty music that I do but the first time I tried to talk to her, which she has only done when I'm talking to her. I don't think a girl like her would ever want to date a guy like me but she doesn't even want to make small talk. She's cool and attractive and I'm awkward and ugly so I can't really blame her.

I tried to talk to a girl the other day when I was at a party with my friends after we made awkward eye contact and said hi to each other but I felt totally awkward as soon as I started talking to her. I couldn't think of any interesting questions to ask her and I kept stumbling over my words and saying shit in a weird way. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong but it still all sounds awkward to me and probably to her too. I felt really uncomfortable and she looked uncomfortable too so I just backed off. My friend went up to her and talked to her for an hour straight and got her number

People used to tell me I have problems with ""confidence"" and ""self-esteem"" and I really liked the idea that I'm an alright

My parents and my therapist tell me I get ""nervous"" and that makes me awkward but in situations like my first example I don't even feel bad until they start acting like they're repulsed by me. My friends don't give me much advice other than ""BE CONFIDENT BRO"" but they make jokes about how weird that would if I got with a girl all the time so I don't think they have high hopes for me. Out of the 10-20 people I know with Asperger's only two of them don't come off as weird and awkward. At this point I'm just starting to think it was arrogant of me to think a girl would want a guy like me, when they can have someone else. How do I fix this? Is it even possible?

1349161683.0,10t1a0,This is the advice I just gave to a socially awkward penguin (with potential to be awesome) looking for dating advice. Did I miss anything?,DreadnaughtHamster,23,3,5,"Okay

But first, and pretty much as ""average"" as you can get. I'm a bit attractive but also pretty damned geeky—think someone like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory but with glasses (and not Einstein), perhaps. Totally not The Situation or some ripped-abs sort of monster. The only real thing I have going for me is that I'm pretty smart and am kind of tall. Other than that, like I said, super average: I like video games and movies, enjoy books, am pretty happy how I make money, maybe two), can play the guitar just a bit, and am currently in a very long-term one that I hope will someday become something more.

I tell you all that because here's my advice

1. Go buy yourself some nice slacks and some nice dress shirts, you don't want to kill small animals when you enter a room.

2. I've never ""picked up"" a girl. I tried once or twice and failed miserably every time. Don't try that. Don't go to bars or clubs to pick up girls—they're full of astounding-looking people and your self-confidence will get shot. So don't try to ""pick up"" anyone. You're not going to be a pickup artist.

3. The best place to start that's pretty safe is probably online dating,"" you say, ""Hey, want to grab a coffee sometime?"" Also, a good place to find ways to have conversations is the book ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie). I digress. Anyway, go to OKCupid or some other dating site (OKCupid is free—no, I don't work for them—and seems to have a decent user base). Fill out your profile, I'd stay away from the super creepy questions

4. Now comes the part where your testicles drop and you feel some adrenaline kick in. I want you to say ""hi"" to 50 females that are high on your matches for both location and age (probably,"" a bit about you, and something nice that you noticed in their profile. 50. Seriously. FIFTY. And you will strike out here. You will get ignored. You're putting yourself on the line and it's going to be frightening and even sometimes frustrating. Every time I would start dating someone, either that I met in person or online, it was always both a thrill and extraordinarily terrifying. (Again, I'm pretty normal-looking—I assume people who look like Brad Pitt don't have that problem.)

5. You're going to start getting some people interested in either chatting some more or hanging out in person. The ultimate goal is the in-person hangout, of chatting too long and losing a potential fun time out with someone (they found someone else), so try to time it so you can take a jump from just chatting to meeting. Also, never seem too eager. ""Absolutely, I would love to spend time with someone as beautiful as you"" is much worse than ""yeah, it'd be great to hang out."" You want be charming, but it's really easy to overdo it.

6. You've got dates. Awesome! Do NOT go to a movie, not yet. I want you to find the absolutely most fun place you can find. Roller rinks. Local street fairs. Maybe a mellow-ish concert in a park. Look at websites for your city. Find something fun. That's the key here: fun. You are not looking for a girlfriend; hell, you're not even looking for a long-term friend. You're looking to have an awesome night that's really fun with someone that will, one hopes, be really cool to talk to (refer back to ""How to Win Friends"" for advice on how to talk to someone). Tonight you're going to buy sno-cones and eat them on the lip of the fountain in the middle of the little plaza downtown. You're going to win a bunch of tickets and get a little teddy bear from the skee-ball machine at the local arcade (and try a round of simultaneous Dance-Dance Revolution with your date—you both will look like such dorks, it'll be great!). Although they're often poorly lit (which is kind of a first-date no-no), swinging on swingsets is always fun. You're out to have fun tonight. Oh, you're wearing those new clothes (the khaki slacks and untucked dress shirt I mentioned earlier).

From here on out, you'll find yourself in a position to have a first kiss. I know the first kiss sounds like junior high school stuff, but often it can be nerve-wracking even for adults, and you seriously have to get some steel balls and just do it. Even if you get rejected, you will have at least tried. Dating is all about practice, rejection, and retrying.

Some additional notes:

- At least once on your first date, depending on whether your date is comfortable with it or not, may or may not happen). At the very least, hold open doors—in this day and age, women find it unnecessary but appreciated, so it doesn't hurt. But don't be so charming that it gets annoying. Use your judgement.

- You are allowed to be the tinniest bit of a dick

- Usually your date will be just as nervous as you are. Try to have fun. Find fun things to do. This gets rid of nervousness.

- Finally, take her hands in yours and say, ""I really like you, and it would mean a lot to me if I could call myself your boyfriend.""",,False,,False,t3_10t1a0

Because of that i had to take many medications my whole youth. 2 sideeffects of those medications where that i rapidly gained weight and developed a skin condition.

Today I am 26 years old

However i do have a job

So

A few months ago i decided to go on an online dating platform. I was completely honest about myself, but of course i didn't advertise myself as a 26 year old virgin. If someone would have asked me so far how many girls i had in the past or something like that i wouldn't have a problem telling them the truth, but as long as noone asks i don't lie by not telling...

So i met this girl who is 27 now and we send each other messages over the last few months. I really enjoy talking

So now i don't really know what to do. I figured we could meet at a bar or something like that or maybe go for a walk later but i just don't know how i should behave. Thats were you guys come into play.

What is expected of me besides being myself? What kind of questions can i ask her without looking like i'm interrogating her. How should i behave around her? I don't wanna look like a creep or anything. And yeah... any general advise in that area is much appreciated.

I know its a long wall of text i just wrote but if anyone read it all and has some advice for me please share.

I realize that it happens slightly (or very much) differently for everybody, after a date or two, just ask whether she's looking for a relationship?

1297262124.0,fi0xx,Here is my advice on how to make a first date awesome,NotTheNiceGuy,22,2,17,"****tl:dr Solid and lengthy advice on how to ask a girl out on a first date

****Disclaimer: Most of this article is examples of stuff I have done

Ok so there is this girl (or guy) you like, or you aren't sure if they are interested... 

edit: Thanks to dashingprince for pointing out something I was missing

My best advice for this is to pick something that you enjoy doing, sit, have some appetizers etc. You are able to talk to each other over the music, or just listen to this awesome guy play the sax. There are also pool tables for a distraction activity, and tons of shit all around that make for great conversation starters. The key here is to show her you do fun, not cliche, things and want to bring her along, its about you doing fun things and shes lucky to be invited. This shows her you have both confidence and self worth.

The best part about this is if she turns you down

If she says yes, make it seem like you go on dates all the time and that its not a huge deal, and this will show that you are fun, laid back, and most importantly other girls want to go on dates with you. This will make you much more desirable. 

While on the date, plan things to talk about just in case the conversation is lacking, but also pick an activity that you can be ""distracted"" by, so it isn't awkward if you can't keep up a full time conversation. The best thing about conversation is plan some stories to tell her. Stories about you and your friends doing cool and fun things show you are adventurous. Stories about your family/pets give her the chance to chime in and tell stories about her family/pets and thus you learn a lot about her without having to directly ask, so the conversation is a conversation, not a two way interview. 

Plan a few ridiculous questions to which the answers don't really matter, then I ask ""When you make mac and cheese, do you make it more dry and clumpy, or more soupy?"" Normally girls won't even answer the question but look confused as to why you are asking this. To which I say in a very joking half laughing manner ""hey you can tell a lot about a person by how they make their mac and cheese."" Stuff like this is quirky and unique and will show you have a sense of humor and are comfortable being silly. It also helps to remind her of you whenever she see's mac and cheese she will think of you and the silly date question. 

Have some but not an excessive amount of physical contact, see [Skitrel's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/f2xfq/friends_or_more_than_just_friends/c1cvxyc) for info on touch and using it to gage/garner interest.

If the chemistry is going well, go in for the kiss halfway through the date, that way at the end of the date you know where you stand. I'm can type out the paragraph on how to go in for the kiss without it being awkward if you really want me to.

****edit: Got a lot of messages asking for the paragraph on the first kiss so I'm going to add it in. Turns out that makes this post too long


At some point in the date giver her something, that way at the end of the night when she empties out her pockets she will find the crane and think of you, and the fun date. The way into a girls heart is if she is thinking about you fondly when you aren't there. When she sees the crane she'll get a rush of endorphins from the positive memory of the date and she'll attribute that subtle happiness to you.

The reason I picked the crane (or any simple origami) is because it can be used later

Another trick is tagging instead of the momento, tell her to hang on to it till next time she sees you. This will double as both a memento for later, and give her a reason to see you again, thus making her come to you. If you never get it back, whatever it was $2. Don't do this and the paper crane on the same date, then it looks like you are showering her with gifts on the first date. 

As for the whole paying thing, or objects, or anything like that say ""I asked you out on this date, so I've got this, and when you ask me out to do something you can pay for that."" This starts the relationship on equal footing so you are even partners, but also keeps chivalry alive. It also implies that she should initiate the second date, and its always good to have her come to you instead of you always chasing her.

I personally never try to make a move beyond kissing on the first date. I take her home and make it seem like I have something important I have to do, but finally I pull away. It is important to end the date on a good note so that when she goes inside she is still thinking about you positively. 

About 45 min after I leave I text her saying I had a great time and was sorry I had to leave. Nearly always this will set up the second date because she will reply back with something like ""I had a great time too I hope we can do it again sometime."" Then you reply ""Well I am going to be doing (some new activity similar to the first date that can be done alone) and would love for you to join me."" This is a bold strategy, but no more than 8 or 9 days. Keep in contact with her between the first and second date, but only casually, and sporadically. Don't text and call her too much, and if she is constantly initiating conversations always reply, but every so often leave a gap in your replies as if it seems like you are doing something important, but still want to talk with her. 

The whole key here is to seem like a fun loving laid back cool guy who is both desired by others, but doesn't let that preference dictate his life. ",,False,,t5_2s4kl,True,,

I was beginning to think he wasn't going to do it

So I get off work, he kept grabbing for my hand. We go in, and he has me sit at one of the tables right in front of the counter and goes to make me some food. He came to me with our food, holds my hands and tells me not to worry. I can see all of his employees looking at us, smiling. I had a strange mixture of anxiety, embarrassment, excitement and happiness. Then he whispered to me

It was slow and his crew came over to us and were telling us that they were happy about what we have and some joked a bit about how they could tell there was something between us. Anyway, but I had no clue what to expect.

We leave his restaurant and he takes me to his apartment. As soon as he opened the door, so here's a brief synopsis.

She told me exactly how he told her, but just pushed it off as some sort of curiosity or bisexuality but never questioned him about it. At this point i'm still crying, hardly able to form coherent sentences besides constantly repeating ""I'm so sorry"". She told me that she is upset about how everything ended and how she was just a cover up, but said that the happiness for me and him outweighed how upset she was. Saying that she's happier knowing that he's finally comfortable with himself and no longer has to lie about who he truly is and that he found somebody that he truly loves.

All of her reassurance was calming me down and we sat around for a couple of hours just talking and actually getting to know one another. Then once my puffy, but instead we pull up to a bar. So for two hours we sat in the bar, drinking, talking, laughing and dancing.....I can't drink because of the legal situation I'm in right now, so that was the most uncomfortable two hours of my life.

She's actually a really nice girl and ignoring my awkwardness, she developed a strong friendship with him and said she would hate to have that end because of this. I didn't want to be selfish, so I told her that it was fine and anyway I actually like her and she seems like a good person to be around and get to know better.

When he dropped me off at my car, 30 minutes since he dropped me off, I'm still shaken up about everything that happened today and I told him I don't know if I can handle anymore while still keeping my sanity, but he insisted that he's never felt anymore ready than he does now.

We ""met"" on POF (like Okcupid but more popular here in England) and texted each other for the week beforehand. 

I was nervous as hell but it kinda went well - we met at 11 at a pub, and then went for a short walk and sat on the grass in the sun. I walked her back to her car at 5, so the date lasted a pretty whopping six hours. Hence I guess it went well and she must have liked me (maybe?). However I still have some questions considering all this is very new to me:

1. No kiss at the car. She was putting stuff in her car

2. Flirting. I just can't do it - I'm not good at picking up on signals, should I have stayed close? Also at a couple of points she moved closer so our legs were touching. A couple of friends say this could have been a little something, and that I didn't reciprocate at all might have put her off. What should I have done there? And the most obvious one of all was when she leaned forward a little and squished her boobs together, giving a bit of a doe-eyed look. She did this twice and I just had no idea what to do - give her a compliment, lean in, move closer, go for a kiss

3. The second date. We didn't make a specific second date, I found her fairly attractive and we obviously had enough in common to talk for 6 hours, but there were a few things about her that I wasn't so keen on (political differences and some attitudes towards things) - is it fair to want a second date to try and work out if I do like this girl or not? There wasn't a ""spark"" so is it worth trying for a second date, or would it just be wasting both our time?

* I finally acknowledged I was smitten when I would find myself coming in to and leaving the building for asinine reasons
* I finally worked up the courage to talk to him.  I knew that he was in a band
    * I initiated the conversation on Monday
 *  He told me that I should 'definitely

 *  I then realized that we hadn't exchanged numbers so I wrote a note with my number on it on an index card.

At this point i wasn't sure whether this was an indirect ""no thanks""

A few days later she asks me out to lunch. At this point i just yes

It was that way, but nothing too bad. To cap off the date, she paid for the bill when i had to take a call.

Towards the end of the evening, so I told him upfront that he looked sloppy. In the past, I have dated men who weren't necessarily the fashion kings that you'd find in GQ, but who would dress crisp and sharp, and didn't look like they were in high school. He was 21, but looked like he was 16.

So, Professional, educated, we have similar interests, he is caring, considerate, funny - basically everything I am looking for in a partner.Things were going really well

The next morning

This is really embarrassing for anyone to talk about- including me. I decided it was a fluke thing and to ignore it, to please be more ""Careful"" and try to be cleaner from now on. He seemed legitimately okay with this and I thought it would be the end of it. No such luck.

Also, ie. he smells good, is generally clean - but there was another warning sign early on with his toenails. They were way too long (like TALONS long) and I told him to cut them because it was a BIG turnoff- he did - and was sorry, he explained his nails grow really fast (not really an excuse in my opinion). But after reminding him a couple times, they seem acceptably short and have since stopped being an issue. Also, when I stay over at his place, his sheets seem clean enough (no visible shit stains) because I would refuse to sleep in his bed if it seemed dirty, he also wears pyjama pants to bed. No problems there.

Well, so I just cleaned them again. I also insisted he wear underwear to bed from now on. (Which I hoped would prevent but also be a hint).

Well, I decided to confront him and point it out. His first response was ""That wasn't me"". I said ""Umm, yes it is, it is on your side, and it certainly wasn't me."" The sheer gall -that even after being caught doing it before- he would claim it was not him ASTOUNDED ME.

He insited it wasn't him, great. But we shouldn't even have to have a conversation about this, I don't understand why this is an issue"" etc.

We hugged and then he left in a hurry. This was Sunday morning. I haven't spoken to him since and he hasn't messaged me either.

I've been dating so many jerks since January and this was the first person I really felt could become something special.

1) He's very noncommittal about setting up dates

2) I can't adjust to his hot and cold attitude. When I'm with him, funny, and fun to be around with. When I'm not with him, I get the feeling that his interest level is minimal due to his lack of communication between dates. Sometimes, he would not even respond back to my texts. I also get the feeling that I'm his back-up plan for when he has no one else to hit up.

Based on the above, so I'm still kind of inexperienced. I want to keep seeing him casually just to gain some sexual experience. I feel like I can learn a lot from him and have fun at the same time. However, a part of me feels like I'm setting myself up for a whole lot of pain because I'm not sure if I'm the type of woman who can do casual sex. I'm conflicted. Some days, I feel like I'm okay with it. Other days, I feel like I should wait until I'm in a relationship again.

Any advice from those who have been in this situation before? Any tips or things to look out for should I choose to pursue this casual sex relationship? Thanks!

Im tired of being a virgin but dont particularly desire a relationship right now(or perhaps im just so used to never being in one).

Occasionally i do get infatuated and i have wanted/tried awkwardly to start relationships(as more than just sexual) or indicate an interest in these persons



If i go out with friends ( both male and female

On some very rare occassions girls have seemingly approached me i get the same fear and end up rationalizing that im not interested in her or that im reading into it too much(when its blatantly obvious)

To add while out with friends i tend to nearly just cling to my friends which im certain gets a bit annoying for them at times

And lately a lot of my friends are just constantly talking about sex and how much of it they're having. Its driving me nuts for multiple reasons:

 I feel like im missing out on something everyone else is enjoying

 I feel like im not an adult because of it.
 and when these conversations come up i feel like i have to remain silent while everyone else talks because my experiences with my hand aren't going to be particularly interesting contributions to the conversation.

 I haven't been on date in years and im starting to worry that either im not capable of having those kind of adult relationships or that im allowing a gap between my experience sexual/emotional and that of my peers to just expand. and the longer i allow it to grow the harder its going to be to cross.

The main reason its probably really starting to annoy me now is because them talking about it is just making it more obvious to me that i haven't been dealing with relationships at all

""i'll approach a girl next week"" or ""i'll wait until the next term of college"" or more recently ""i'll wait until i have a job"" these are all just excuses for my own inaction.

I like to get things done and set boundaries. If things are broken, let's fix it. If you want to be something, let's work towards that. If you want to stay FWB, let's maintain that.

Hello fellow redditors!

I've been itching to end my life as a single guy for the longest time, picking up hobbies, try to do more things so I have more to talk about, you know how it goes.

While I'm not quite where I want to be, well, I'm not used to that. I don't recall having anyone really flirt with me, or like-like me in the longest time, and I'm the sort of guy that can only see black or white; either I believe everyone and their mother are into me for trivial reasons, or I'll just shut myself down to these signs because I can't conceive they are directed at me, in that sort of way.

I used to be the prior, and have been this way for years. I can never seem to tell, and I'm probably the worst single guy in the history of time in that department, I don't think I even have the ability to flirt at all. 

Thanks!

I recently turned 30, I wasn't able to talk to girls until I was 25, and after that, the job (which was and is going very well) ate up most of my time. Plus, at this point, most of my friends were in long-term relationships already, so I got nobody to go out with.

I have been on several dates. Sometimes, it was the other way round. And it also happened that there was nothing. What I wonder is if I somehow failed to ""lit the spark"", by not ""being sexual"". And, perhaps this was caused by ... well, I masturbate a lot. I have been thinking about stopping it for a few days, and then try to go out on a date. Do you agree?

My second question is about the age. At 30, and it fuels my fears. She says: ""especially considering a man's twenties should be the height of his sexual life. At 30, it's almost a deal-breaker if the guy hasn't had least a 3+ year relationship.""

In the midst of conversation she reviews her dating history and states that over the last year and a half she's seen a range of guys but never made anything official because they all at some point ""smothered her"". She saw a lot of these guys within a range of 3-5 months.  

In that same conversation she stated that she hadn't met any guys that she liked enough to make time for over and around her friends. As she said this she laughed and stated that I was an obvious exception. (She travels for work and is around only on the weekends and since we've met I've gotten at least 1 or 2 of those days.) She and I get along really well and her friends have all expressed that she really likes me. However, like those before me, don't come across as ""smothering"".

The question I have is how to proceed. Not in the sense of logistics, use protection, etc., and nobody involved has made any real statements of feeling/commitment yet. But that also sounds a little self-serving, so I don't know if it's a valid rationale.

The flip side, I may end up with nothing, which I REALLY don't want considering a 6 month dry spell. I don't imagine a conversation along the lines of ""I can't sleep with you…there's this other woman, and I want to keep my options open"" ending well.

So I met this girl online and we've been chatting. She's pretty cute, etc)

I honestly think she's interesting as a person, so naturally I have butterflies about the whole thing. It's been a couple of months for me so I'm dying to get laid again. 

The thing is, and she knows that. She's also stated that true love isn't up there on her priorities at the moment, but sex is.

I'm worried about 3 things:

1. The age difference. I'm afraid her mother will flip out. I'm a decent and polite guy and I don't look sketch

2. Pregnancy. She's not on birth control and she doesn't feel abortion is an option for her personally. I can't get her pregnant. It would destroy both our lives. I'm so close to taking off and fulfilling my dreams that a pregnancy would shatter everything. I use protection all the time

3. I don't want to hurt this girl. I *really* want to have sex with her

Thoughts?

**EDIT** Ok

A) She is **NOT** under age.

B) I perhaps gave you the wrong idea of just how head over heels she is about me. She merely said I was the coolest person she had met. She only said it like twice in 30+ messages. She does not keep going on and on about that. She does not text me at all hours of the night wonder what I'm doing. I'm sorry if that made her sound like a cat5 clinger. She's not.

C) Of course I'd use protection. I'd insist on it. I also have the morning after pill on hand.

I have the usual concerns of her already having a boyfriend, etc. I guess my concerns are not wanting to put her (or me) on the spot in front of other people. I also want to ask in a way to give us both a face saving exit in case nothing is happening between us but I also want to get a definitive enough answer so I know if she's interested or not. I used to always avoid dating girls in my dorm or at my work because I always feared the awkwardness of it not working out but I need to not let that get in the way of allowing things to work.

We finally met each other on St. Patrick's day, and pretty much slams me against it, doing irrevocable damage to my dental work with her tongue and mouth.  The make out session was great, though short lived, and we were both a little drunk.

The next night we hang out, and walk her to her front door.  We make out again, and I leave, feeling great about everything, and starting to feel enamored with this chick.

We hang out again the next Monday, she says she really wishes she didn't have to go help her friend plan a wedding, but she didn't have a choice.

We hang out the next day, she invites me inside, and things start to get heavy.  She is rubbing me, and I am rubbing her, and she stops it.  She says he wants to take it slow, I agree, and we continue to make out until I go home.

We spend Friday together, we kiss and make out randomly throughout this.

Monday, go back to her place, we start making out, and it starts to get heavy again.  She stops making out with me, looks me in the eyes, and says 'do you want to go to my room and fuck me?'  I say yes, because what the fuck do you say in that situation.  The sex is great

Tuesday

Thursday

Saturday, I get overly drunk, and tell her that I am not seeing anyone else, and actually stopped seeing the girl I was with before, because of her.  I then slur out that I really like her, she says she feels the same, or she wouldn't be doing this if she didn't feel the same.  This makes me feel good, I tell her that I want to be exclusive.  She disagrees

The next morning, and talk some, nothing too big.  After I get home, she sends me a big text, saying how she can't stop thinking about me, and that she loves that when I say something I actually do it, I don't just talk about it.  I tell her that I can't get her off of my mind as well.

Monday, and in the post-coital haze, I ask her about Saturday night(I didn't remember asking her any of that stuff).  She explained to me what all happened, and such.  I tell her again, fully sober, that I do want to be exclusive with her at one point, that I understand right now it is too early, because she has a bad habit of jumping into things super fast.  I tell her I understand

The next morning, I ignore the first one(I was busy at work), and she sends another one asking if I feel alright after the talk last night.  I tell her that I feel fine, I understand where she is coming from, and so long as she is being honest with me I am perfectly fine with it.  If she wants to take things slow, then slow it will be.



I don't exactly want a relationship right now, taking it slow means waiting to have sex.  I am willing to give her time for whatever she needs, but I just know I will have a time limit on being able to take it slow.

What exactly do I do?  Should I pull back on texting her as much?  Should I still be the one to ask her on dates

My best friend is getting married in a month, but would that be weird to ask her?

It is a weird state of being, and when I want something, I go for it, regardless of what it may take to get.  So this is the total opposite of what is normal for me.

I don't want to push too hard to lose her, 'I want to think things slow,' she really means, 'I do not like you.'

I (26) met this girl who I will name ""G"" (24). We both met during school of spring 2012 and during the first class when we saw each other I knew that G liked me and I liked her. This was in our physics lab class and we meet up every other week doing lab work together in a group with other people.

I was accutane for oily skin

Recently I text her and chat a little about how are we doing regarding our semester and I can tell that she wasn't really interested continuing with the chat. My question is that should I tell her or not? Part of me wanted to tell G because since there was no closure and at the same time I also wanted it to get it off my chest. Other part of me I know that she's no longer interested and I am wasting my time so I shouldn't say anything. 

tl;dr I stood a girl up due to accutane/depression and haven't talked to her in half a year with no reason stated besides an apology.

But I need to say that the urge to have a girlfriend has always been extremely strong in me. When I was 6 years old I started to get feelings for girls, and when I started to realize how that worked I used it to my advantage. 

I started to fabricate scenarios where the girl had opportunities to be with me but it was very limited. The reasons I used ranged from being in love with someone already, you name it. And I had tremendous success with it, but after 4 years of doing that and more than 15 girls I decided that I was fooling myself since I knew that deep down inside I wanted a relationship and not this. So I changed back, I joined online dating sites and I tried to find a girlfriend again but with no success. I think that is because I have an inflated sense of ego, thinking things like I should only settle for the best. Since this girlfriend thing has been the main goal of my existence I have hyped it up to be something that reality can never satisfy. 

Now I've stopped looking. I removed myself from all dating sites, and if I do in the weeks to come I will not go in there with the ambition of finding some girl to talk to. Because it is just so mentally draining to be focusing on that all the time. I've started to focus on my other intrest way more, I exercise longer, I read more, I write more, I play computer games with friends, I'm more devoted at my job. But the fact remains that I want to find somebody

It's just so hard for me because that is not how I see anything else. I know that the guy that works out the best is getting the best physique, the more you try the less you get.

After a little more talking, and of course a little more drinking, she just went for it and started kissing me. She did stop me at one moment and say something along the lines of ""I don't ever do this sort of thing in public...it's not really me"" I told her she could stop if she wants, and she did. For about 2 mins. Then we were all over each other again.

Here's where it gets a little sticky: I walked her to a bus stop, leaving us to talk (and kiss) more. I'll spare you the details, since she'd talked about her past, and got a little upset. Then she turned to the conversation of men who have messed about with her.

I am curious as to what the general population thinks about this subject.  Personally, like maintaining a level of confidence.  I think that if everyone was similar to the kind of ""men"" these articles portray, we would live in a world of ignorance with a population unable to think critically.

Am I wrong?  Are these archetypes healthy, and although I am confident in most areas of my life, the one thing I lack confidence in is women mostly because while I have done nothing but fail, I see women date the biggest losers.  This lack of a win just perpetuates the lack of confidence with each loss and rejection.  I try to feel like each rejection brings me one step closer to meeting a female who accepts me for who I am, and where I am going in my life, but it's hard to act confident and ""NEVER"" feel insecure or nervous around women who treat me like I don't exist but date felons, gang members, drunks.  I understand that women like confidence.  I understand that I am letting what other people think effect me, then rationally concluding that there is no right or wrong, and I wouldn't change for anyone.

We met on JDate. We messaged back and forth a couple times

It was the best date I've ever been on, so many things went wrong, it could have been terrible because of that.  But it was like... as soon as we saw each other, everything felt so natural and normal. There was no awkward window like there usually is in a first date.. We had this amazing rapport (physical and verbal) right away.  It felt more like a third or fourth date than a first date... I should add that we were both sober this entire time, so no social lubrication was needed.

I ended up spending the night at his apartment, although we did get almost completely naked at various points.  Every time it seemed like it was building to that, he'd just stop, and roll away.  We spent most of the night talking, even talking about what we liked about the other person.  In the morning, he pulled me close to him, and was just rubbing my back and running his fingers up and down my arms, we didn't have sex.  I even asked him if that's what he wanted to do

It was an amazing night.

The catch?  On Sunday, I don't know what to do.  We have so much in common, and I feel like we've already been intimate on a level that goes beyond sex (personally, I don't think sex necessarily is intimate)... i just feel like we really connected.  

I don't know what he's thinking about us.  I asked if he wanted to see me again, because I keep thinking about things I want to talk to him about, but I haven't heard from him since our date (Saturday).  I know he's really busy, and he's got a lot on his mind, so I don't want to come off as clingy.  

My rational side says to wait it out, and proceed to keep in touch til he comes home.

The emotional side of me wants to call him right now and talk about this super nerdy science article I read that's relevant to something we talked about the other night.

1329850919.0,pznuj,"Are there any women left out there that actually want a relationship, a family, etc.?",Shit-CanIt,20,27

I don't even know where to begin. Basically, live in a great place, have some great friends, and I've gone back to school to finally finish my education. 

However, someone to go out to dinner with, someone to stay up late with, someone to talk to, and (obviously) someone to have sex with. 

The first woman I dated I really liked (and still do in a lot of ways). However, never when I ask for it. Anyways, she's definitely not the right person if she says that she's never going to love again. 

I dated another girl for only one date then. She was an ex of one of my best friends. I actually really liked her, she wasn't interested in a relationship and I am. Just too many problems and differences there. 

The third woman I dated... well I don't think she ever really liked me at all, I continued to date her for another month before she breaks it off. I am very mad at myself for this one. 

Then there was the girl that I really liked. Really attractive (best looking girl I've ever had a date with by far), we both loved hiking, we're both atheists, we had almost identical senses of humor, and we even had the same birthday. I met her in one of my classes. I was really good in the class, she was not. She just happened to sit by me one day and I helped her out a little and we were pretty close from that point on. Towards the end of the semester, we started going out for drinks after our Thursday class. We started hiking on the weekends and then *she* finally broke down one day and asked me out on a date (I didn't ask because I figured she was out of my league). However, she told me that she made plans with some other friends later in the night. What? Then

The one common thing among all of these women is that all of them told me that they didn't want to have a relationship with me. I feel like women look at me and think ""He's not bad, and I can't get anywhere. 

The problem is that the older I get the less and less people I meet. In addition, or kids (I should say that I'm not looking for some old-fashioned 1950's wife here, I'm just looking for a partner).  

I don't want to do the online thing because every friend I has that does the online thing ends up with more problems and more crazy people than I can shake a stick at. I don't want that so I don't do it. 

I guess my question is where do I meet new women that actually want a relationship? I'm so sick of getting dicked over and being used by women. My self esteem is just shot from the last few women I've dated. I just want to meet a girl who does want a relationship and is open to a family (eventually). Are there any of you left out there?

1328219936.0,p8azk,The One That Got Away,Thanotopsis,17,2,13,"This is a bit of a read but I think it will be well worth the time and hopefully someone can learn from it.

She just invaded my dreams again. A stealthy assault on the mindfucking part of my brain. I haven’t thought about her in weeks. How does she keep slipping into my mind and doing this to me? She has to be the one that got away.

It’s almost been 10 years since we first met, red hair, bright blue eyes and a giant smile with the most perfect teeth.  Girls like this never talk to me.  They don’t even give me the time of day, but not this one.  Hours of conversation ensued on our mutual friends’ picnic table on the porch.  Her and I couldn’t stop talking to each other as if that awkward silence that always happens, even between friends, was forever banished from our young minds.  Everything just flowed and our minds perfectly aligned.  I knew that I had to keep this girl in my life.

That summer

Summer of 03. Eventually, even at that age I knew that making life altering decisions based on a woman wasn’t a great idea. But I can’t say that she wasn’t part of the decision.  That summer we rekindled our friendship and it grew even tighter.  Our mutual friend base had been shrank to only a few of us.  This is when the night that I let it all slip through my hands.  We hung out a lot, but never just the two of us.  One night there was a friend of ours, her and I sitting on the back of my car, talking.  My feelings for her had grown quite strong over the summer and I really wanted to make her mine.  My neighbor, who was the same age, was having a party.  I didn’t associate with him and his friends, just the two of us

The next couple of years her and I stayed very close but on a strictly friends level.  We told each other everything.  I respected her boyfriend, even if were just friends.  

Months would come and go and eventually we would graduate
  
About 4 weeks before she left for college, even to this day, for her.  These next couple of weeks, it was as if she didn’t even have a boyfriend.  I could feel her feelings for me and she could feel mine for her. She started ignoring her boyfriend and just being with me. We would hold hands and these intense feelings would grow but never crossing the physical line.  One night, while bringing her home, she finally broke the ice, turned off my radio and asked “what is going on with us?”

I replied “I don’t know but I like it”

She said “do you know what it’s like to want to jump your best friend’s bones?”

I just laughed that nervous laugh because I had been feeling that way for years.  We got her driveway and both sat there in my car talking for hours.  The sun eventually would start to rise as the conversation got deeper.  I finally shared with her how I had felt for the past couple of years and she was telling me the same.  I asked her if she remembered the night two summers ago when we both sat on the trunk of my car. I told her that I wanted to ask her out so badly but never did.  Her response still makes me regret not having the balls to do it. She asked “Why didn’t you ask me out?” I was destroyed.  If only I had taken that chance and gotten the strength to do it

She left for college

I wrote this because I just woke up from dreaming about her.  In the dream, we live ½ way across the US from each other. I do hope though that someday we will be brought back together.
I guess that I finally decided to write this hopefully as a lesson for the younger readers that might be in the same situation.  You might be a nervous

I haven't been in a relationship since high school. Not that I haven't tried, still its pretty damn low.


**About how I met her (Jane) [22F]:**
I met her a few months ago at an outing for her brother's 21st

About 2 months ago I was at John's brother's house (after a banquet where John, still figured off limits, so I didn't say or do anything about it.

**So here goes Saturday night:**
I was invited to attend a party on short notice by John. It was a going away party for Jane before she moves off next weekend for the summer (or more) to a city  about 2 hours away. I showed up with my own booze

I wasn't thrilled that Jane was leaving for the summer, but knowing my success in picking up girls from the past 7 years I figured it would probably be a waste. (hooray confidence)

So everyone starts drinking, runs inside and whips up some more concoction. We start talking a bit in a group setting, I eventually finish my cup, and follow her to the kitchen to help restock my cup. This cup happened to be both the start to my evening, and gateway to my recollection of events. 

Not much after my cup is mixed, the alcohol was starting to hit). We talk a little bit, I find out it was John himself that put in the good word. We go wandering around, talking to everyone, attached at the hip it would seem, stopping occasionally to go make out somewhere else in the house. Like an idiot, I continue to drink the drinks she keeps making. And this is where memory stops (for a while).

Memory fades back in when she has to leave to take her friend home (who was left at the party

**Sunday:** 
Texted her back and forth lightly throughout the day. Made some simple plans for recovery coffee 

**Monday:**
We may have wasted both our work days judging by my text message history. I think we both had slow days at work anyway. The conversations were kept to a funny (70%)/flirty(25%)/trying to piece together Saturday night (5%) mood. I get some good indicators ""...Glad we started talking :)"" and some bad news ""packing all week... leaving town saturday after work"" 

**Tuesday:**
Kept it to a minimum to see if Jane would initiate conversation

**Where it stands:**
I would like to see the girl before she leaves

My real problem is my lack of any game whatsoever. Nowadays I'm friendly, ignored me, and I nearly lost the friendship).

Even guys I find attractive I tend to distance myself from if they start paying attention to me.

I think in large part, I feel inadequate due to my complete lack of dating and sexual experience, and ashamed/afraid of what to do in an romantic setting with a guy. So, fear/awkwardness combined with an aversion to intimacy, or something like that...I'm an independent person (after 6 years being single, who wouldn't be, right) and am accustomed and comfortable flying solo by now, I feel every so often like I'm missing out or that there's something wrong with me.

I have this big problem with trying to not be too eager around women.

Now I'm the opposite; too aloof. I know I'm good-looking, funny, great to be around. But I'm just scared of being another guy creeping on women. I've dated a few feminists and have two sisters and several of my friends are women, and I notice just how much women are assaulted from all angles by men trying to get their attention. I know I'm not necessarily like those other guys, but I'm petrified of being that way nonetheless.

My concern is the fact that her culture is considerably different. She came from a war, very opposite of the hard upbringing she had to endure. Some of the quirks in their culture I feel make it harder for her to understand when I am making a joke, so sometimes I think she would get mad at me because she did not understand. My sense of humor is very important to me and while its not the end of the world I feel like I may get somewhat bored with someone who doesn't find the same things funny that I do. Also their is a very slight language barrier, she speaks English very well but occasionally gets stumbled up on a words, or has to ask me to define what a word means when I say it, which I certainly don't mind but I could see this being somewhat irritating in a longer term relationship.

We dated in High school for about 6 months and broke up for several reasons, but because were were both in relationships and going to school several hundred miles away, no move was ever made.
I've dated a bunch of girls, but I cannot believe how well everything worked with her - it just ""flowed"" like I've never experienced before. Her reaction too, was ecstatic - not the kind of reaction you get from a slightly intoxicated hookup - but genuine excitement (maybe a bit too much excitement?) She most have told me a dozen times how happy she was this happened, and how she was a bit upset I didn't make a move sooner. We talked for hours into the wee hours of the morning, fighting off sleep even though we both had work in the morning. I remember her mentioning something about the 'terror' of a broken heart, presumably from fear that the distance and our hectic lives (we both work 60+ hours a week, she is in law school, etc) would prevent us from working - I even told her not to dive headlong into this
I half expected her to pull back in fear, we havent talked much. I gave her a call one week saying I was going to be down in the city for work and if she would like to meet up, only to not respond to my texts when I was down there then finally say at the last minute she didn't want me to think it was a date (which I never did) That was at least three months ago and we haven't talked sense.
I've never felt so attached to a girl before, one which I will be taking. Seeing as a good number of friends live in the city (and it's somewhere I have wanted to live for some time) I will be looking to live there. I want to tell her in a way that's both nonchalant yet still hinting at what I do want. The problem is, I don't know how to do so without coming off as being desperate to contact her. I'm not sure if telling her how I feel is a good idea - I don't want to scare her, but I'm not sure if covering it up is a good idea either.

Some information about me; I'm 22M, a bit younger. I've only made out with a girl once when I was 19, I enjoyed it a lot (expect that she was a smoker) but it was a one night-only thing, since then nothing happened. Then I went out with this girl a bunch of times, that is all the romantic experience I have.

So those dates in the past weren't really inherently intimate; I figured it's going to be a lot easier to transition into cuddling and making out when you're sitting next to each other on the couch

I live alone, and we're going to cook together. Anything else I need to prepare? I've never done this before, I'll probably be nervous as shit tomorrow. I won't do things like set up candles and play smooth jazz, that is going to make everything super awkward, plus I'll probably burn down my place in the process. I could play some nice music, we have similar tastes.

Anyway, but I'd like to get some advice before we meet. Some do's and don'ts maybe? It's crucial that we get intimate this time, we've been on too many dates without kissing already, it's probably some sort of record. So, thanks for reading!

**Update**: Okay, we actually had a pretty good time, we cooked together, ate and talked (food was good). Then we watched the movie sitting next to each other on the couch. I sat down really close next to her; hips touching and shoulders touching, she didn't seem to mind. We watched the movie like this, at the end of the movie we were at least as close as we were at the beginning, maybe with some more weight behind it, maybe inexperienced

Right now I feel pretty numb, but when she's actually sitting next to me the mental barrier is just too much. There was no flirty atmosphere.. On a more positive note; it was good practice and it'll be easier next time, we did get closer than we have before. Plus, I think we had a good enough time, I'll probably ask her out on monday.

I try my best not to be clingy, I can't help but think there is something wrong with me physically (or sexually). However, when I discuss with my friends they always assure me that I haven't really done anything wrong.

But if that were true... I wouldn't be single and crying myself to sleep every night because I'm destined to be alone.

Today, I stayed silent throughout the bus ride. She was on her laptop and listening to music through her headphones. I remember that her water bottle had fallen out of her backpack while she was distracted and started rolling towards me. I went to pick it up for her at the same time that she did and we made eye contact and she gave me a friendly smile. I think that it was because she was a little bit embarrassed about letting the bottle fall on the floor.

So shortly after, so I ripped out a piece of notebook paper and did a quick sketch of her. I also wrote that I thought she was pretty and asked her if she would like to go on a date with me. I folded the paper and passed it to her. She looked confused, but then she opened the paper. She smiled, and looked up. We both smiled but neither of us said anything. She pulled a pen out of her backpack and wrote something on the paper. She passed it back and it said,""thank you for the compliments. haha I have never been on a date before, do you go to [the college]"". I responded by writing,""I am interning here for the summer and that's okay because I've never been on a date either"". She looked at the letter and smiled. She wrote down ""Sure I guess? I can skip a day of work next week...here's my email [email]"". She smiled again.

I was surprised and happy that my letter actually worked. But after I got off the bus, got a potential date with a college student who has also never been on a date. I don't think that the girl knows that I am in high school and is probably waiting for me to email her. She is also willing to skip a day of work to go on the date, which I don't know how to attend due to the fact that I don't even have a license! I don't want to lie to the girl and I don't want to leave her hanging. It's tough because this might be the first time a guy has ever asked her out, and I don't want to make her feel bad. I feel terrible about myself. I've made a big mistake, and I don't know what to do. Can you please help me?

I really feel like I can identify with you when it seems like there is no one else who does. We've laughed at rage comics and memes together and shared our deepest secrets together. You've helped me kill time through boring classes and 10 hour shifts many a'times. What I'm trying to say is that you are all my bros

I guess what I am asking isn't typical of what's found in r/dating_advice. However I feel this is the most appropriate subreddit I could think of.

I have read magic bullets, and no matter how much money I make nothing will ever change about my personality. I am horribly shy and scared of approaching females. The thought of approaching a girl gives me a feeling similar to looking off of a cliff. However, I understand sometimes I have to fucking man up and go for it, which I have tried, and failed. Every time.

I should be used to rejection by now but this time just hurts. I have tried all the methods of trying to express interest in a girl

This time I had met a very nice girl from college and dug deep into my courage reserves to ask for her phone number, and genius me decided to make a fake get together for her to come along to, and I would casually mention it and invite her. So I called in favors from all my friends and mentioned that we were going out and that I would love it if she came. Which she said yes, pretty enthusiastically. The event was for my 24th birthday.

Wish me happy birthday guys by the way. As soon as I go to pick her up I am one block away from her house, because I'm a gentleman. Anyhoo, I then get a text saying she can't make it, citing legitimate excuse, she was tired. ""no problem, there's always next time, good night"" I say back. 

And that's that. I drove home frustrated at an average of 80mph, I have had no idea how to even make a thread until today.

She told me she had a blog and tried to send me a link shortly after we met

So I did some digging, and I eventually found it last night. Needless to say, it was a bit of a shock. She has some very colorful pictures of herself, along with some pretty flirty/suggestive posts, which has raised some concerns. She's told me that she's looking for something that actually matters, and a post she made a while back seems to confirm this, but there's quite a lot of suggestive material up there. From everything I could tell before

Given what little of her backstory I know, in and of itself, but this is a really unhealthy way to do it. The blog nowhere near anonymous, and it's public. The potential damage this could cause in several areas of her life is very high. 

I'm not judging her, and about us.

I'm really at a loss. She's a very sweet girl, I'd be constantly worried about her fidelity and/or perception of our relationship.

**The Dating Machine**  
The dating machine is where you ask a gal for coffee or lunch and she accepts. The two of you then research each other online and prepare questions for the date. You pace uncontrollably for hours or even days before-hand worried how you will act or what she will think/is thinking ect ect until your nerves are shot and you've likely performed poorly at school/work durring this 'waiting period.' Then you get to the day of the date. You meet or take her to the predetermined location and fire 20 questions at each other for 30~40 minutes. Eventually, a genuine conversation will start and there is a 70% chance that you will get to that second date.  
**Whats wrong here?**  
Well, if you are wracked with nerves then she will likely see you as spineless. Or if you just ask her questions about her facebook she will see you as a stalker, creepy, or socially inept.  
Later
**Break Things guide to a flawless first date**  
It, you may be thinking 'this is corny' but it works! EVERYONE goes to the grocery. People are comfortable there and if the 'date' goes south then at least you have knocked out the chore of going to the grocer for that week.  
So
**CRITICAL**: The date can end here but you must seal up a second date before she leaves ""I like spending time with you
""We have all this food
If she turns you down then don't take it personal
If you are lucky
Disclamer:  
This can sometimes lead to sex (esp if wine is involved) so if you are not looking for that then you need to keep an eye out. It's easy to get swept up in the moment and make a decision you may later regret.

She's a white gal, has 2 children (about 11 and 17 years) who live with her.

I've been working at this job about 90 days.

She originally interviewed me and I was instantly attracted to her.

I only see her once a week or so at work (we work different shifts). When I speak with her, her thoughts about her future, etc.)

I find that I'm spending time thinking about her. I like her smile

She has taken extra time to 'chat' with me after work... but only a few times.

The thing is

I'm not shy or inhibited... I could ask her out for a coffee easily... but SHOULD I? If I'm misreading her

I don't want to be a 'friend' and if I ask her out

But SHOULD I?

As a final thought

I haven't WANTED to date until now... and she happens to be my new boss.

I look forward to hearing thoughts... especially from women.

Ok. Enough. After reading the comments (thank you)

I've taken a deep breath and decided to simply lay low on this.

The good news is that I'm sort of happy that my heart has appeared to come back to life after my divorce (it was quite harsh).

Sooo... I'll chalk this up to a delayed rebound and not act on my impulses.

I appreciate all of your comments.

a couple weeks ago, but the way it ended up, we spent the entire evening together at a bar while his friends were at a different bar. Everything went extremely well and a good time was had. When we were done , we spontaneously spent the night in a hotel together because his friends couldn't provide us a place to stay. That's when things crossed the line and we got intimate and physical.

After that night our relationship hasn't changed much; we still communicate about the same amount, but my interest in him keeps growing. I'm starting to wonder if the feeling is mutual, but I can't help but doubt it. I try to match his level of displayed interest, initiating conversation no more often than he does, but on the inside it's my natural instinct to want to keep pushing things further. 

But what do I want with him? What does he want with me? Surely not a committed relationship; he and I both very recently got out of long-term relationships and surely don't want to start another any time soon. There's also a good chance that he won't be living in the area after the summer, that I'll start to like him much more than he's into me, and maybe I'll start to feel used, and things will end in disappointment. Right now I just feel confused and extremely vulnerable and I can't get him off my mind. Not sure where to go from here. Should I talk to him?

I started to plan out how I was going to end my life.  The only thing that I felt like I still wanted to do before I followed through was to experience sex.

I ended up in a place where brothels are legal.  It was in the first world

I didn't enjoy myself at all and wasn't able to perform properly.  I thought there was something physically wrong with me, especially not for money.

This caused me to do a lot of thinking.  In my thoughts, it's sharing with my life with someone.  If we have sex, that's great, but what I really want is to be with someone that I love, and someone who loves me.

The problem I have now is that I've paid for sex.  That can never be undone.  Looking around on a couple reddit subs, I have no clue what sex is like with someone you love.

This is the only questionable thing I've ever done in my life.  When I think about what I've done, that it's her choice.  I don't at all support trafficking, pimping or abuse against women.  I have a lot of respect for sex workers, I can only imagine how difficult their lives can be.

In my search

The first two stances are mutually incompatible.  If a woman needs to know, but I don't know if I could keep that from someone if I were getting very serious with them.  Some people suggested flat out lieing about it in all cases and never telling anyone, ever, for any reason.  Even if I was OK with that, I'm a terrible liar and don't think I could keep that up for a long time.

I don't think that I would lie if I was asked directly

When should I bring this up?  If you were dating someone

Another possibility would be to lie and end the relationship for other reasons.  While this has the advantage of not requiring me to say anything

I feel like I've completely screwed up my life.  I'm still working on my other issues, and plan to continue doing so quarterly for at least two years, then yearly after that.

I met this girl on the internet. We started exchanging messages on the website we met on and she gave me her number to text her after the first day we started chatting. We started to text at a good pace, they are so new and they came fast"". 

After about two weeks of talking every day, and ended up going to a bar after and then having one last drink in a park. I wanted to kiss her in the park but didn't, because sadly for me I'm kinda tentative in those moments and I generally wait until a girl gives me a clear sign before I go for a kiss on the first date.

Anyhow, she tells me she'd rather not go to the movie because she wants to keep talking instead. I agree and we hit up this hookah bar where we have a wonderful time. She misses her last bus and tells me she has to come back at my place to sleep, but makes it clear nothing more than cuddling is going to happen. Fine with me (well, kinda). We go back to my place, talk and cuddle, I try to kiss her but she kinda turns me down because it was a bit awkward (I was pretty drunk/high and my approach wasn't the best lol). We sleep together, cuddle and everything seems well. 

At that point I'm really starting to fall for her. We have a stupid amount of stuff in common, she makes it clear she's into me. 

We plan a third date, I'm thinking we're about to make things official. 

We meet for food and it goes nicely, she says she's starting not to feel well. Bummed out but still confident, I tell her it's ok if she wants to cut the date short, because we were still seeing each other the next Friday. 

We go out separate ways. After that point, and she didn't seem opposed to it either). So I told her how I felt, that I liked her and wanted to be with her. She tells me she needs time to think about stuff - yeah, never good. 

We talk on and off the next few days, didn't know what to answer but thought I'd still answer."" WHOA. Wait, what?

We proceed to have a conversation where I ask her if she still wants to see me. She tells me yes, because after all, that's what grown folks do, right?

Well ever since then

Now I've pretty much accepted the fact that it won't work between us, or if it's because I fell for her hard (probably a mix of both), but I just can't take her out of my head. I see her online and it hurts. I'm angry at her, but at the same time I'd still do all I can to have her back. I just can't shake it off the way I generally do and I don't get it considering we only dated for a bit over a month. I keep thinking about messaging/calling her to get closure and try to understand how things could change so quick, but I haven't mustered up the courage to do it as of yet. I just don't know what to do right now.

Don't know if I should bother pursuing

We met on OkCupid

So guys, low self-esteem sirens going off, how boring, but just bear with me. I know I'm not *really* a bad guy--I'm reasonably smart, super nice, compassionate, considerate. I'm semi-knowledgeable about a number of things, etc. Have been told by a couple people other than my mom that I have a handsome face

Anyway, but better. In some ways we are very similar, but at the same time couldn't be more different. It's like she's a version of me that I wanted to be, but never ascended to, so I can relate to all her ideals/politics/interests but I don't actually walk the walk.

**Her**

* Very busy
* Is in good shape
* On track to become a professor 
* Has traveled all over
* Is quite good-looking
* Outgoing

**Me**

* Dropped out of school, not stupid problems)
* Chronically unemployed
* 70 lbs overweight
* Rarely go out, have no hobbies outside of internet/games 
* Have no definite plans
* Low self-esteem

My dating profile says I'm employed full-time because I was, and she didn't ask me any questions about what I'm doing right now. We just had a first coffee date, and I rushed off after 45 minutes because I suddenly drew a blank on what else I could ask or say, panicked, and blurted out that I had to go. She seemed a little taken aback. Our conversation was neither crackling nor boring. I guess it could have been a lot better, but all ideas for interesting conversation topics fled from my mind at the time. She seemed like she had a reasonably good time though and was showing signs of nervousness. (The good kind of nervous, I mean. I might sound a bit unhinged in this rant but I assure you I seem quite normal in person.)

Anyway...I'm just so bewildered by this situation because...well, what can I offer?  But people keep telling me that I'm too hard on myself and I shouldn't write dating off for now...and then I got this message from this girl out of the blue, decided to follow up, and now here I am with her still assuming I'm normal and stable. I kind of feel like I'm just leading her on to inevitable disappointment. 

Here are some areas where I'd like feedback: I think I want to see her again, or I'm just lonely and would like a friend, or...whatever. I guess it's okay that I don't know yet. I also just realized that I don't feel a strong gut-level lust for her, though objectively I think she looks great--I think this disconnect is just because imagining getting physical with her seems so unrealistic right now. Should I text her and say I had a good time? When? Should I make up an excuse for leaving early? Should I even see her again at all? What should we do for date #2, if she agrees to one? These are the most pressing questions running around my head at the moment. Thanks to anyone who read this.

Did he lose respect for me? 

UPDATE: Talked to my step-brother about it without giving details. He said that a lot of guys lose interest in the girl if she has sex too soon because the mystery is gone. A lot of what keeps a girl on a guy's mind is wondering what she is like in bed which turns into emotional investment as the connection grows with more time spent together. He said the best way would probably be to wait till a committed relationship.

I've made some mistakes over the past three months. I broke up with my boyfriend of three years in January

I had been crushing on this guy who entered my friend group a few months before. I didn't think he was interested, but if you wanna be with anyone else in our friend group/outside of it let me know because I don't really want to share.  I made it clear it wasn't a restriction; it was ""fine"" (not really but I'd deal with it), but just to make it clear so I wasn't running around confused. Well, he totally did not do that and eventually after some bumps, he didn't speak to me for 5 days and when I asked him what was going on, he basically said that he hit it and quit it. Gave a bullshit excuse. I couldn't understand (at the time) why he didn't just tell me. I had really liked him and I felt used, and betrayed because he was someone that I thought of as a friend and I couldn't understand why a ""friend"" would do that. 

During my time getting over this, but  we enjoyed each others company. We both got out of our relationships at the same time, and we both wanted something casual. He would call/text me pretty often till about last week when he had a bunch of work he had to do for school. He called me Wednesday night and I told him that I liked him- and he said ""I like you and you're a great girl but I'm not looking for anything serious"". I thought we established this, and it didn't need repeating. I invited him out to a festival that happened this Sunday. He said he might be going away so I left it at that. I didn't hear from him until Sunday, and he apologized for ""being an asshole and not keeping in touch"" and asked to hang out. I couldn't, but he said he wanted to hang out soon and invited me to a play on some date that he didn't know. I accepted but haven't heard from him since.

Soooo, now I feel like he's kind of backing off even though I have been so so so careful to give him space (and myself). I admit that I have been catching feelings. 

So

How do you date casually without falling for all kinds of bullshit? 
How do you deal with actually liking the person you're casually dating? When they reject you--even if you know you've done nothing wrong--how do you minimize the disappointment and sadness you might feel from it? How do you get to know someone whilst still guarding your feelings? Sex? What do you do with it? Do you have sex? Cause I have a really hard time saying no. How do you build the emotional wall to deal with consistent disappointment and rejection? 

I've been trying to get advice on this from everyone. People thought I jumped into dating too soon (probably), that I made myself too available, and maybe that I'm not a person who can casually date. I know that rejection itself isn't a big deal, and that there are billions of people out there, and why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you, etc. Its not terribly comforting though, and I'm terrible with compartmentalizing and the amount of time and energy I spend thinking about this stuff is actually affecting my school work.

We would chat about whatever, playful banter. She would tease me back, which one of my coworkers told me was a test (how are you going to react to her teasing?). By this time, I had asked her for her gChat and we had chatted online a few times. One of the ongoing jokes, is how this security guard always tries to talk to her. When she notices him walking her way, she sends me a message ‘help’ and ill call her work phone to get her out of talking with him.


**Sign #3: The people I work around all noticed this sudden increase in her coming by and started to ""welcome her to the group"". They liked her. Girl coworker: ""she is starting to show a lot of interest"".**


I had invited her to a Thursday ""happy hour"" which she accepted (despite not initially being invited since were on different teams). Keep in mind; this was the first time ""outside of the office"" that we actually hung out and it went well.

I was out sick for 3 days and worked from home. 


**Sign #4: Well


We chatted for a bit online


**Sign #5: When I came back to the office



**Sign #6: Frequent prolonged eye contact**


**Sign #7: mirroring body language**


**Sign #8: laughs at my stupid jokes**



**Sign #9: I initiated playful touching by high fiving her


I was beginning to feel the possibility of ""friendzone"" approaching) though as we began to see each other EVERYDAY.


**Sign #10: - Facebook friends (makes point about how we should be facebook friends – I add her late one night


A week after going out for ""happy hour"", kept reminding me ""the window is closing, you need to make a move to prevent 'friendzone'.

February.

**Sign #11: - Buying ""squares"" together -- gives us another chance to talk/see each other.**


* Lauren: i think we picked some good spots!

* Lauren: hahaha
didnt you get my email?
i explained it all
i sent it from my iphone and it said it sent!

**Lauren: wait call me**

**Called and was put on speaker phone and talked to her Dad

**We ended up making plans to hang out that evening**

*Lauren + her sister (who she is very close with) and me. They said they needed to freshen up and would meet me at the wine bar (45 min drive for them). I called my friend and we met up. 
Met the sister for the first time
Lauren and I chatted

** FIRST FRIENDZONE WARNING SIGN:**

Can’t remember specifics, “…well, we work together”.
That comment(s) kinda threw me off and made me, hot waitress was hitting on me, not sure if Lauren saw but it felt good. We chatted but as the night went on, I was starting to become less interested as her comment from earlier kept playing in my head. Walked them to their car, said goodbyes and for the first time, gave her a legitimate/bracing hug. We continued to make eye contact as she was walking/getting into her car.

The Bachelor 
One of her favorite shows

**Became ""walking buddies""**

* Me: hey
* Lauren: hahah im glad i didnt fall :)
ditto


**Sign #11: started bring workout clothes since I mentioned we should do harder/longer walks**



**Sign #12: We playfully pushed each other
 


**Sign #13: Told her I had hit a new “level” in steps


**The Jealousy Test:**

While walking back to the office after one of our 1hr+ walks,which she responded with “yeah, he smiled at me, so I smiled back at him”. We walked a few more steps, and she turned around and smiled back at the guy again. 

**To which I said, walk, and lookback”, “you want me to leave you alone with him?”.** 

To which she said, pointed to my head and repeated “NOTED”. She didn’t seem to appreciate that almost as if I had called her out on her test. I went on to tease her and say, “you should go back there, get his phone number. Remember though, to keep a guy, you need to put out on the first date otherwise he wont like you.” To which she responded with “oh really, well im going to tell him you said that”. We got back and I went to my car to change and she went upstairs
P.S. she did admit before the walk that “its that time of month” which I believe may have contributed to her moodiness.

At this point, that I called her out on. 

**2/14 Valentine’s Day:**
* Went out to lunch on Valentine ’s Day
* Went for another 1.5hr walk



**Sign #14: Towards the end of the walk


Every 10

**1st RED FLAG!** With the mom on the phone
I said outloud
To which I think the mom picked up on and changed the conversation around. 


**Sign #15: ordered Valentine’s Day gift a week earlier


The other day

**We spend the next 2 hours in the conference room

* College boyfriend of 4 years (ended 4 years ago) – emotionally abused her and threatened her numerous times yet she always went back to him

* “Friends with benefits” guys – “I don’t do that anymore” she says.

* Another guy who cheated on her with his ex.

* “We don’t talk about him” – she ended the relationship

She showed me pictures of her family as they had just put together an online scrapbook and I shared stories about my family as well.

Last Friday – I knew a 3 day weekend was around the corner

* Me: are you still here?

* Lauren: no im at home now

* me: whoa

* Lauren: nope

* me: just saved your number

* Lauren: good

**Yesterday:**

Drove to her house, playing with the dogs. Finally left, and drove to the trail. Walked the trail, talked, playfully teased and pushed each other. 

**Sign #16:She talked about how next weekend we could do a harder trail and that she wants to show me the lake etc.**

After we finished the trail
We ride bikes back to her house where her dad and I play video games, Lauren wants to show me more of her hometown. We drive all over the town, shes showing me all the houses and where people live, downtown etc. Grand tour.
We get home and have dinner. Talk about wine, she jumps onto my back for a piggy back ride etc. 

**You need to make a move**

We get back to the house, give them hugs and walk back to my car. I turn around and see both of them there watching me. “We want to make sure you get to your car safely”. At this point, my heart is racing because my opportunity is slipping away. 
I yell out to lauren, I want to ask you something”. She walks over, “whats up?” and I see the sister watching us from afar. I yell to her sister “go away” playfully and ask lauren if she wants to go for one more walk around the block. She says shes tired and “whats going on?” as she can tell something is on my mind. I say to myself “fuck it” and tell her:

FRIENDZONED

**“well
*She responds with: “Scott

To which I respond (one of the other) looking up in disbelief “shit
She says something but I don’t hear it and **turn and walk away to my car and say “Thanks Lauren…” and drive away…**

**Within 20 minutes

* 12:14am **Lauren**: “Scott…I’m sorry…I didn’t know that you were looking for more than friendship. That’s all I can give

At a gas station

* 12:21am **Me**: “&lt;&lt;&lt;vday secret admirer”
* 12:24am **Lauren**: “That was very sweet of you…it definitely made me smile:) ***I didn’t know

* 1:11am **Me**: Hey

* 12:29pm **Lauren**: Of course everything is good! I’m not that kind of a girl so don’t worry about it. Week 3 &amp; 4 might be very different so watch out:) Hope you have a restful day…My butt is killing me!

* Today

**I haven't responded to her text...**

Regarding ""points and steps""

So, (according to friendzone etiquette), ill become less available, ask her about girls and see what happens. 

**Did I read the signs correctly? Should I have been more aggressive? Was there a chance or was I just played?**

I had a plan that I believed was pretty solid - went up to the register and said I didn't want to fight with my Dad over who was going to pay the bill so could I just take care of it? While we were up there I was going to say how inappropriate I knew it was to ask her out at work but was gonna do it anyway. Except I completely pussied out and didn't say anything. The place was pretty busy and I wasn't ever sure how she'd respond to something like that while working. So now I'm out 60 bucks with no phone number!

I decide 2 days ago things are never going to progress between us because he makes me feel so shy, ""figure out what kind of guys I like.""  I will give the highlights of our evening:

* He tells me I am pretty

* I mention that he looks like the guy I lost my virginity to.  He says he would be happy to re-enact that.

* He gets down on one knee and fake proposes to me.  I fake accept and kiss him on the lips.

* He tells me that if I have ever drank too much to get home

I don't want him to lose weight ""for me"". The idea of someone changing themselves for another person like that is completely repulsive to me. But it's unlikely that he's just going to spontaneously start eating better and working out, maybe you didn't find them attractive at first, but after a while you came to love them and it didn't matter after all? I don't know. I really like him, but I just don't want to sleep with him the way he is right now, as awful as that sounds, you know?

The one thing I will never do is try to ""encourage"" someone to fit a certain standard that I think they should be. I believe that you should love someone for who they are, then that should be their decision. I had a boyfriend who tried to change me and that relationship has left me scarred to this day. I will not take part in that. So I just want to know if you guys have had experience with developing physical attraction later on to someone whom you were initially not physically attracted to.

1376456140.0,1kbw9k,How can I show interest in girls and ask them out when I'm shy and am a total pushover when I like a girl? (22 years old in college) I'm pretty much stuck and I kinda am hating myself for it.,911carreraS,15,3,20,"I'm shy, however slim the chances are b/c I do that cheesy romantic stuff...ugh) and I had bad experiences w/ the girls I dated (they were users and I put so much effort into it dating that I ended up getting attached =/. I also predicted all of their motives and mind-games perfectly ).

How can I approach girls out and ask them out when I'm shy? I usually end up discouraging myself from dating girls if they're popular or good looking because even though I'm super smart, but really I've accepted that I got to do it most of the time and it just feels like a lot of work. 

When I do approach a girl (I usually pick someone who I know is single or can deduce is single super easily like a really unpopular girl or girl that most guys would be shallow enough to avoid) and start talking to her the idea of asking her out comes to mind too quickly (like I want to ask her out after talking to her for like 15-30 mins) and I get awkward about it, but lately I just feel like such a loser. There was also one period where I asked out pretty much every girl I talked to and I just felt like a complete tool doing that (kind of like doing cheesy romantic stuff makes me feel like a complete tool). 

I think almost all of it stems from lack of experience (i've never been in an actual relationship much to my chagrin), but I unfortunately am constantly realizing that the best way to fix it is experience. It's like how I got 3 A+s in organic chemistry. I made myself dive in and do every single fucking thing without caring how many mistakes I was making at first and then I was perfect, confident and getting 100% on midterms. I need to do something like that with girls, but really I just would like a girl who would appreciate me, I wouldn't have to try super hard with, and didn't make me feel like shit. I also don't want to be a total callous douchebag, even though I'm slowly on my way there. I'm so cynical about everything in dating right now, but I'm conflicted about that too b/c it's between deciding if I want to just find a special girl or just lose it.

I'm also very impressionable about this stuff because I  have don't have much experience. I really don't want to be defined by constant bad experiences in dating because I know it can be really fun and awesome w/ the right girl who cares about you and who you care about. If I did something stupid or just haphazardly dated losers that'd just mess w/ my mind.

I have a question for the guys out there and am looking for their opinions on the ""cool"" girl (my definition of cool = basically being able to fit in as ""one of the guys""). Is it possible for a guy to develop a romantic relationship with a girl who may not be the stereotypical ""girly girl?"" 

I've never been good at flirting, am sarcastic, and just try to be fun (and I just love to make people laugh). Sometimes, I feel like it sabotages my ability to develop a connection with guys on a romantic level because I can be labeled as the ""girl who will watch superhero movies and actually like them"" or ""the girl who curses more and says more inappropriate things than some guys.""

Don't get me wrong - I'm not a tomboy by any means. I do girly things (wear makeup, etc.), I just find that a lot of guys become surprised from the things I say, the things I like, and the things I do.

I get to the bar at about 7:30, watch the ball game. Seems like more of a couples bar than a singles bar, but I do eventually spot 3 attractive looking girls go sit at a far table by themselves. I've been told that as soon as you spot someone interesting you should walk over and introduce yourself within the first 3 seconds so you don't have enough time to psyche yourself out. Well I don't do that. My social anxiety is greatly improved but not totally gone. I proceed to spend the next hour and a half or so to work up the balls to go talk to them.

I talk myself up by reminding myself that they likely would be as happy to have people come up and talk to them as I would be, etc etc. Most of all I tell myself no matter what it'll be a positive experience for me, at the very least breaking the seal on this dumb stigma against introducing myself to new women. Finally after a bunch of that and a little more liquid courage, I somehow get myself to walk on over.

I say ""How are you girls doing tonight? I'm new to the area and thought I should start saying hi to people."" (All true.) A couple of them laughed and one of them replied ""&lt;incomprehensible&gt;...You're not going to get far with us. Keep making the rounds.""

Well that was incredibly awkward and anticlimactic. Half the night to work up the courage and I'm shot down on the runway. Coupled with the fact that I'd already spent my nightly allotment, which if right does take the sting off a bit. But suffice it to say it wasn't the result I was hoping for.

This isn't a request for advice, it's possible for guys to be clueless at dating even well into their thirties; AND b) no, it's never too late for you to change your outlook. Hopefully this will help others who are struggling to make that initial overture, and stimulate discussion from more experienced people.

**TL;DR In the space of two months I broke a year-long dry spell, and losing the mindset that it was somehow shameful or embarrassing to show my interest in a woman.**

*The background:* Before May 2013, and I thought that successful dates and happy connections ""just happened to other people"". Even before that, I had slept with six women in my life, only one of whom I actually approached. The other five had made the first approach to me, either online or face-to-face or through friends. A year before, I'd just broken off three online-generated relationships simultaneously because they had clearly just become physical over six months, and I wanted more than just a bedpartner.

I didn't know how to approach women. I'd be fine if I were just friends, I was in the situation that women commonly find themselves in: they can get a physical connection if other people will approach them, but they want an emotional bond with somebody they really like, but they are unable to make that first approach to the target of their affections.

Two of my longstanding female friends are a lesbian couple, rock climbing, and salsa dancing. Basically, I treated them like they were my guy friends - people I respected and cared about and wanted to share fun experiences with. They also had many other female friends, whom I largely discounted from romantic interest because of the age gap.

*The Tilt*: May 2013 is when things changed. First

One of their friends was a woman who would speak her mind very openly and unselfconsciously. I think she was undergoing counselling and one of the exercises was to build her self-esteem by just speaking her mind. Well, you tell stories remarkably well"". She would say these as flat, straightforward statements of fact, clearly with no romantic ulterior motive. She would simply throw out these affirming positive statements with no doubts whatsoever, and get happily back to her routine.

Each of them made my day. Absolutely. And it was just a simple logical leap for me to realize: people like to receive genuine compliments. And this was coming from a woman who didn't even like me or have any romantic interest in me. Why had I been so timid with compliments all my life?

Instead I learned from a colleague undergoing counseling that a compliment is actually one of the least expensive

**If you admire something about somebody

This is related to the next step, then alternatively just tell them. Whatever you do, don't bury it and hope they'll guess - that's minimally effective."" (Show over tell, because if you show them, it gives them some room to consider and digest it and to get on the same page as you. If you tell them outright, it puts them on the spot... which may be entirely okay if the other party is equally as gung-ho and ready to go as you are. By extension, the third option - waiting and hoping they ask you - requires not only that they are equally interested but also that they're *more willing to extend themselves* than you are

In early May, but in May something about seeing her made me realize I was no longer okay being single. That I no longer wanted my romantic emotions in deep freeze and I wanted to let them out again to play. I don't know if I was actually attracted to her, or more just what she represented - somebody comfortable with her own sexuality, for whom romance was easy, simple, and nonjudgmental. But I finally knew I was ready to meet somebody again and I was okay being honest to myself about that desire, rather than play the emotionless chessmaster eunuch.

I took them salsa dancing. They had a great time, chatting to various women and trying to feel out whether there was a connection. By the end of the evening, I'd struck out, and rejoined the lesbians and the visitor, who asked me gently how it had gone.

""No luck, and *you* weren't leaving town..."" It was the first sign of interest I'd shown them, semi-serious though it was.

The three women looked at me in surprise. Then

Really? Seriously? Four grown people had all the requisite interest and requited inclination for relationships

Think about that for a second. All four of us were too afraid to say anything, because she'd assumed ""athmirleen probably wouldn't be interested in me"".

There are some good reasons not to date somebody

(The outcome here was mixed. The gorgeous visitor had to leave the next morning, and all that.)

With the lesbians, trusted friend to them - and so when they began to desire heterosexual relationship experimentation, they knew I could be trusted not to hurt them. This concluded amicably in early June, just as an unrelated exclusive romantic prospect came onto the scene.

**If you like somebody, but better than the third option, which is...) Do not just sit silently and hope they can read your mind. They might, but chances are low and it's much more likely you'll just end up regretting your reticence forever.**

This is getting lengthy so I'll end with one more lesson - once I'd overcome the mental block of hesitation or fear of rejection or faint shame attached to showing my interest, nonmisogynistic introduction to effective honest dating). 

At a networking event my advances met with reciprocated interest - I struck up a conversation in English and Chinese with a beautiful Master's graduate, telling her I enjoyed her company and would like to see her again. Our first date lasted four hours and the restaurant kicked us out to close up. She stayed the night a couple of weeks after our first date, and since then we've done gaming, martial arts, hiking, and lots of cooking together. Just over a month of seeing me, she had the exclusivity talk and is about to break it off with her other dating interests and go steady with me. I'm delighted.

I'm very happy with where I am now (not only with more dating and sexual experience under my belt

I hope these reflections will be of some use to others who are wrestling with the same anxieties that I did - and that wiser

[Old post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/151eyv/some_general_advice_for_men_nice_guys_dont_have/)



Rejection is something that most of us are looking to avoid and is always on our mind anytime we see someone that we're interested in. For me personally



There are a lot of mechanisms built into us that stop us from doing things that may have direct negative effects



Our ego is a very important part of our sense of self




Most people feel rejection is due to something wrong or inadequate about them. This is not the case. While growing up your brain develops it's own idea of what a suitable mate is. It's largely based off your parents and your life experiences. In the end you really don't have a conscious choice to whom you're attracted to, ""Dude! That's a person who could potentially give you some awesome offspring!!"". Did you make the decision to be attracted to this person, no you did not, your brain did. If the same exact things go off in the opposite sexes brain then you have mutual attraction. Unfortunately that's not always the case. Sometimes only one person gets that feeling. So why didn't they get that feeling? Well for example it has been proven that most women go for a guy that have similar qualities to their father. Is that your fault that your DNA doesn't contain the code that sets of the other person's boner alarm? Absolutely not. Does that mean you're inferior for not triggering their attraction response? Nope, because the DNA code you got was not a choice you made, it was given to you and there's nothing you can do to change it.



When being rejected it's not because a person is any less of a human being it's because the other person was given a set of DNA code and was brought up in an environment that just isn't compatible for mutual attraction with that one person. These are factors that are beyond your control


Bottom line is, so don't get down on your self for not winning the mutual attraction lottery because that's basically what it is.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,

This is an update to: http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18rq3r/i_23f_confessed_my_attraction_to_my_friend_24m/

Long background story short: about a month ago, but now I have new things to puzzle over - new things that will entertain the ever-loving shit out of you.

I straight up asked him what he meant by stuff like ""that's not awkward on a personal level"" and ""just don't lose your head over it."" He explained what he meant, so we carried on as normal, catching up with each other. He told me about his brother's upcoming wedding, and how it was really putting him off relationships (his nonverbal communication seemed to say he was waffling on this, but at that point, I was sure he wasn't into me, so I didn't think much of it) and about all the crappy stuff going on with his mom, landlord, he expressed concern that I would still want to be his friend and was relieved when I assured him that I did. I figured

Now, but given what he'd said about not wanting a relationship, I assumed that these were friendly touches, not flirty ones and didn't read too much into them. I avoided touching him back so he wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Eventually talk turned to what's been going on in my life. I said he pretty much knew everything going on with me since I had explained in my letter about how recovering from being really sick was the impetus for me to confess my attraction (basically, my whole endocrine system took a shit on me and my reproductive system decided to join the party). I joked with him about how it felt like I was going through a second puberty and said that I'd gone a little hormonally nuts. To make my point, I told him about wanting to hate fuck my cancer-stricken obgyn.

He was doubled over laughing at my story when he suddenly straightened up with an odd look on his face. ""Can I tell you something?"" he asked.

""No, I'm one of the least prudish people you'll ever meet. I talk about stuff like this with my friends all the time; it's not an awkward or unusual topic of conversation for me. All the same, I was not expecting him to bring anything like this up given that we'd only just got past me being into him and had never really talked about this type of stuff before.

I said absently said something like, ""Now you're gonna smell like my perfume."" He was not concerned at all by this. He was not remotely bothered by the fact that he was going to show up to his friend's house 20 minutes late and smelling like a girl.

So I went on 5 dates with this girl. They weren't really traditional dates per se because we live far apart from each other. We could only see each other on weekends so we usually spent 1-2 days together hanging out each time. We also slept together starting from the third date (but didn't have sex).

We kissed the third time we met and the fourth time I tried to initiate some more intimacy but she turned me down. We talked about this and she said she wasn't really sure how she feels about me. 

Fifth time we saw she felt a little reserved so we talked about this again. She said she still wasn't sure how she feels about me but she said that she enjoyed spending time with me. She also mentioned that she had been lonely before meeting me and that she was enjoying the positive attention that she got from me and was worried that she was sort of using me because of this. 

I really like her and I think she would have still dated me but at this point I felt that this wasn't going anywhere and to avoid feeling even more miserable later on I decided to end things now (though we agreed we'll still be friends). And now I've been feeling really down about this and I've been questioning my decision... Should have I given her more time?

(Part of her uncertainty was also related to the fact that she had only been on a one long (6 years) relationship before and that was with a girl.)

1362276593.0,19jzo0,[21M] Recovering drug addict looking for help to break out of my shell.  ,CelibateHeroin,14,3,11,"Have to use a throwaway because some real life friends know my account and who knows if they be shtoopin'. Anyways I'm just looking to gain some perspective on my life and some possible advice to better myself. Hopefully this won't be long.

So I'm a 21 year old college student, you've all heard it. My life has been plagued by celibacy and diffidence since it started mattering. I'm 21 years old and have never made out with a girl. I have only gotten short pecks after a date here and there. That's seriously it, not even first base status. I have not had very many chances with women in life, but I can only blame myself. And I want to change. 

I attribute two of my poor qualities to the hole I have dug myself. First, a very important time in my psychosocial/sexual development.  When I was 16, I started smoking marijuana daily, and experimenting with psychedelics by 18. This love for psychoactivity further progressed into an oxycodone habit my first year of college at 19, and finally a heroin addiction when I was 20.  Luckily, due to lack of availability of the drug, I was not incredibly deep into heroin addiction as the stereotyped junkie and I was able to stop using on my 21st birthday.  Now, life has become very empty. Underlying emotional problems that I was probably masking with drugs have surfaced and been brought to light

Second, I stayed away abusing drugs, writing music, and being just generally introverted.  I rarely tried with girls to begin with, and when I did, I didn't have much confidence to ever take it anywhere. This just repeated the cycle of loneliness and drug abuse.  

Now

The questions I have in relation to dating is my level of honesty.  I'm so inexperienced with flirting, and I'm sure its quite easy for girls to pick up on this. When I begin to meet girls, how am I supposed to establish a connection that could show my potential? Considering my life has been in shambles for four years, faking it will only take me so far before they see a problem. How do I maintain my integrity without ruining my chances immediately (no one wants to date a celibate heroin addict), or having to resort to lies and deceit? When the moment of truth comes, and I suck with intimacy, how am I supposed to respond? By saying I have never made out because of schizoid behavior and heroin addiction that left me socially inept? That will weird people out beyond belief. 

I'm just pretty lost socially and looking for ways to break out of my shell to a point where people don't have to immediately shoot me down because of my past, when, clearly in my age demographic, I'm not because of how weird I am. What are ways to get over this long bout of celibacy, depression, loneliness, and drug use? I just try to not give a fuck and do my best

I feel like once you get used to rejection, in my opinion, losing the fear of rejection can instill confidence in you that may make you less likely to be rejected in the first place. People love confident people pursuing them, it strokes their egos.

So, so in my dating experience before that, starting at maybe... 16, I've been rejected by girls I've had total absolute dream about them every night crushes five times. Amongst all that I've had 2 big relationships and about 3 smaller ones that didn't really evolve into much.

1359493673.0,17ing6,Never dated before and now I'm interested in someone,skindredzakuska,14,2,22,"I am a 19 year old male. I went to college for a semester and dropped out because I didn't like it at all. I am currently pursuing auto-mechanics (which is my passion). I have never dated anyone before and I like to think it's because there has never been anyone in my life that I would want to date; besides

So I had joined a group when I was attending college and am still part of that group as an ""Honorary Member"" because I am no longer a student at the university. Eventually, other than that she was incredibly stunning. We never talked. I hadn't thought to. But then I went on a trip recently with the group and she was there too. We sat on the same bench of the van we were riding in. Behind me was this douche talking to his girlfriend and her friend. He was boasting like an idiot and telling the least funny jokes and giving the worst impressions I have ever heard. The chicks were laughing this dumb nasal laugh. I started thinking to my introverted self while listening to my iPod about how much the people in the car were annoying me. Then I thought to myself, ""This chick beside me isn't annoying at all! She's not laughing at his stupid shit. *I would date her*..."" Then I couldn't get that thought out of my mind.

I have grown uneasy. My stomach feels weak, I'm just sitting in my room, alone (oh yeah, I live at home). I can't get this girl out of my mind and I really want to ask her out. I've never wanted to ask someone out before. I really want to try this!

Here's the problem. I only see her when we are at the group stuff. The way this group works is there isn't a moment alone. Everyone is together discussing stuff for the duration of the meetings. I don't know anything about her. I am guessing she's 21, or delete my Facebook. So now I have no way of contacting this girl and a moment alone would possibly be more than abnormally awkward because there is absolutely no reason why we would ever be alone together.

**TL;DR**
I'm 19 she's 21. I dropped out of college
(here's my questions)
How do I come onto her? How do I hint to her that maybe I like her? How do I determine whether she likes me at all? But of course, everyone would know eventually. But the problem is if she says no, then things would get awkward for everyone. I think I'm afraid she will say yes. I'm like a dog chasing a car, I wouldn't know what to do with one if I actually got one. Advice on the dating stuff if it goes through? I don't want to un-impress her by doing dinner and a movie; it sounds too immature and high school-ish to me. My friends say it's not.

We all started hanging out frequently then it became almost every weekend. I guess me catching feelings was bound to happen. She's got a very eccentric and awesome personality. I love everything about her. 



I've often found myself not being able to take my eyes off of her, and sometimes ill take her phone and she'll start to hit me until I give it back; little things here and there. The closest I've gotten to kissing her was on New Years, we had gotten a little silly together and went outside for a smoke and talked. After the talk I almost went in for it, but I held back. The thing that's stopping me is that her brother is one of my best friends. I have so much respect for him and his parents. I'm practically family over there since I'm always over hanging out with them. Idk what to do, advice is much appreciated.

But I still went ahead, blaming it on his nerves.  

Get to the date, he mentions why he picked the table he did, he asks a bunch of questions about whether I'm comfortable, dressed warm enough, how I would like to order, etc. etc.  At this point I'm just overwhelmed and I haven't even gotten a chance to check him out and decide whether I'm attracted to him.  

The conversation flowed well, anything I said he was on me like a hawk and immediately would throw in something about himself that he thought was ""just like"" me.  It honestly started freaking me out.

Then he said, he was...very slobbery. Like, his mouth was over mine and kinda felt like he was sucking my face off. Then he used A LOT of tongue and I kinda had to back off and sort of show him how to kiss. I didn't really want to teach him how to kiss when it was our first kiss! Well, we got past that (I didn't make it a big deal) and then he drove me back and our date ended.
For some reason, I can't help but reconsider pursuing the relationship. I feel so shallow for dwelling so much on this, because you can easily teach someone how to be a better kisser! It shouldn't be a big deal! **I'm just wondering if I'm being silly for over-looking everything else just because of his kissing skills?

Ok, especially when one or the other of us was drinking. I was never the initiator of flirty texting mostly because I feel like I have no clue what I'm doing, but if he'd initiate then I'd respond. Never got anywhere past PG-13 level stuff though.

After about two weeks of texting often like this, so we'd walk over and get coffee at around 3:30 and he'd always insist on paying. At first it made me a little uncomfortable because I've never dated anyone who always insisted on paying, but since he had a good job and knew I couldn't afford Starbucks twice a week, he'd insist and I would enjoy the attention. I always figured that he would ask me out eventually, and I figured I'd try going on a date if he asked, but he never did.
Fast forward about two months and the same thing is happening, he would come join us. But until then he would have to work early every morning and just couldn't come out.

So last night, and he joined for the first hour before having to leave to deal with his campaign work. I had gone to the bathroom when he left, so he didn't even say goodbye. After Obama won the election, I sent him a single text that said ""Mazel Tov!"" and he responded ""I love you."" I laughed it off, figuring he'd been drinking and was just in a good mood from the election. I responded about how we were going to the bar to celebrate and asking how his party was, and he responded ""No, I don't think you understand
So here's this guy who I've never been on an actual date with. Sure, especially because we wouldn't get to know each other, just talk and complain about class. After the second ""I love you"" text, I tried to give him an out by asking if he'd been celebrating a bit too much already for the evening, to which he responded ""Yeah, but does that change anything?""

It was late when that came in, I'm guessing because I didn't respond. I wrote back that he's been celebrating a bit too much, and that I liked him but we've never even hung out outside of class, and that he was coming on too strong.

My question is am I overreacting? I've dated casually before but only ever said I love you to one guy that I had been dating for months already. It honestly made me nervous when he kept pressing that

I have a class with him this afternoon and tomorrow

Should I be concerned? If he does ask me out should I accept? I would have a week ago

**TL;DR:** I don't understand why the hookup culture is so prevalent. Are girls in college just trying to get laid without putting effort into a relationship? Why does everyone only want to ""hook up?"" I don't like the way that women in college are acting. The atmosphere is apathetic and porn-like rather than loving.

I have always considered myself one of the old fashioned romantic types, plus I don't drink so trying to find a girlfriend at a bar is not really an option since I don't think I'm going to find the type of girl I want there.  Besides I like heavy metal and the only bars we have around only play country or rap.  

I live in the country and there is not a damn thing to do around here, ever.  The very few that have ever responded only gave me one word replies so getting to know them through conversation was impossible.  

The only thing I have to offer a woman is love, I'm over weight, people say that I am a decent looking guy, and I think I am, but that doesn't seem to help.  

I thought about trying an international marriage site but again I'm not rich and those things are expensive.

Loneliness has put me in a serious state of depression and nothing kills confidence more than depression does.  The few chances that I have had to ask a girl out I have passed by because I always told my self that she was out of my league

I have managed to get myself out of that depressed state by not thinking about being alone.  Usually by reading

So do I continue the seemingly hopeless pursuit of trying to find a girlfriend and run the risk of falling back into the pit of depression where I might not be able to claw my way back out of?

* We are both mid-20s. I've only been in one serious relationship
* Met the girl on a dating website. Our relationship goals are basically: ""see what happens"". We've been on half a dozen dates in the last 6 or so weeks. As far as I know
* We have some of the best conversations I've ever had. Our personalities mesh incredibly well. We both find each other incredibly attractive
* We have great physical chemistry (more on that later)
* She basically works 2 full-time jobs during the summer... as well as a very active social life. She will start full-time school locally in September. 
* She does not phone/text. It can take her days to respond to things. In person, as I don't want to come across as needy.
* On our dates
* We have not slept together. We tried on our last serious date, where I met some of her friends. 
* We tend to leave dates open-ended
* On our last date, so she took me out to a coworker's party and she introduced me to everyone. During the party, there was some physical contact that showed affection towards me (rubbing of the back, hand on thigh). At the end of the night, she was falling asleep, so it ended with light kissing and a goodnight. Still left me cold, though I understand the circumstances were not in our favour.  

**My Questions**

* When busy people date
* I brought the (lack of) texting/calling thing up at the end of the last date
* Is the fact that she took me out to a friend's party and introduced me as a friend/guy she's dating especially positive? Or does it not really say much? 
* I understand it's a ""if she wants to see me
* Would it be beneficial to have a ""hey

As the second semester went on she started to become anorexic though, and that was what made me decide not to ask her out, because I wanted someone who was content with who they are

Anyway I nearly stopped my attempts and basically lost contact when summer came around. However when recently discussing this with my cousin he pointed out that I didn't know WHY she went anorexic
With school about to start I don't know if she's in any of my classes, and how would I go about it?

A guy I've thought was adorable for ages asked me on a date.  I'd only spoken to him a few times, yes.  He's quite pleasing...""  So, I suggested he come to an awesome dance party I go to once a month.  He couldn't because of a prior plans, but he did ask me out.  He asked me on a Sunday and said he'd text me later with the location for our date on Thursday.  It got to be the day before, and I hadn't heard from him.  But instead of being worrier-weirdo-needy-girl, I figured I'd wait.  Later meant the afternoon before the date.  All good.

The date was awesome.  Pub first, listened to tons of music - never a dull moment.  He about died when I had to see his apartment to use the bathroom.  Then, he suggested mindless TV, WHICH turns out was an adorably lame way to have an excuse to cuddle with me.  Commence makeout.  Super fun, aside from the fact I had a total Bridget Jones moment because I was wearing Spanx.  Baller.  He did say something about me being done kissing him yet, and I couldn't tell if he was being cheeky or was actually tired of it.  He didn't seem like it, so...

I fell asleep cuddled up to him for a while, ba-dum-ching.  

There was a little back &amp; forth

Then, so I went to turn.  I blew a tire pretty much right outside his house, so I grabbed my bike, started huffing it, and ended up running into him a block down the street.  He said I should've called and gave me a ride home.  Chat, chat, nice, etc.  I mentioned that now that I've gotten promoted I wanted to go somewhere for dinner that's really yummy just because I can.  Before I got out of the car

Little bit of texting - maybe one or two every couple days.  

Friday I texted and said I'd be busy for a while, I called.  He was busy.  He really is busy - he's consumed by his work, which I actually find very attractive.  He's incredibly driven and passionate about what he does.

Anyway - Wednesday the 4th he said he'd call back after a family event, etc.""  No answer, no word from him since.  

The couple of people I've spoken to about it have said, etc.  But, I don't know.  If he were into me, I'd think he'd have asked me out by now.

So she and I continue talking while she's massaging her breasts *just* below the frame on the webcam (I think she planned this). In my horny guy mind I think ""maybe if I make the first move

I reply with ""well...if you really want to..."" but she counter's that no, but doesn't say anything about it. As a matter of fact, she doesn't say much of anything at all, until I say that I'm heading to bed.

I text her afterwards asking if something was up, etc. 

She replies with simply ""ok."" So I write her off as gone. No big deal

Two days passes and she texts me ""So I understand why I'm not talking to you

I told her that I figured it was over

I think this confused her because maybe she's used to guys desperately begging for her attention? I got the feeling that she wanted me to beg for her attention too

She said she still wants to talk to me, since that's what has happened to her in the past.

I told her ""look. I need you to communicate with me. I need a verbal ""no"" if something makes you uncomfortable. I don't want to do something

It just feels like a guilt trap. She claims to be really aggressive sexually and that once she starts she can't stop

So on one hand, who is pretty aggressive sexually (which I like), but then on the other hand, she might be crazy and she lives 2 hours away.

My gut is telling me back away

So I’m dating this guy, it was also amazing and pretty romantic. We talked and then we went for a walk but he didn’t make a move on me. He texted me that night telling me it was great. The next day, my plans

He did tried to put his hands all over me(we hugged, held me, even touched my breasts at some point while we were hugging and caressing each other ). But he continuously talked whenever our faces were close to each other. And I don't mean talking like a normal person, he was rambling about stupid unconnected things(like the paint on the ceiling, his hairdresser and bureaucracy) in this weird nervous voice. So I guess he might have been shy. He even insisted to come to my place but I had some problems with my flatmate at that moment so I explained to him why and we decided we will go another time (this happened at the beginning of the date). I gave him a hug at the end of the date, it seemed the proper thing to do. 

Now let me give you some information about my interaction with him. He’s really sweet in person, big difference and I would expect at least one message from time to time saying how are you. Two days ago I asked him out and he told me that he couldn’t talk because he was busy. Later I found out he was at this big event and he really couldn’t talk. I agonized for one day and told myself that I shouldn’t call him. Today he sends me this funny picture without even telling me anything.  He often did that in those 10 days we didn’t met, either randomly telling me something or sending me funny pictures. 

He’s also pretty jealous

Anyway, he hasn’t gave me an answer when I asked him to go out two days ago. I have no idea if he’s interested in me or not, or he’s just a weird guy. Maybe he's playing hard to get? I mean, I get a lot of attention from a lot of guys and he knows that and he also knows I don't really like guys who give me too much attention because we talked about it before our first date (we chatted about 12 hours before we met because we met online).

So what should I do next? Wait for him to ask me out? Ask him out again? I've been getting a lot of attention lately and it's pretty depressing that every other guy is interested in me

I will apologize in advance for my grammar mistakes. English is my second language and it's also very late.

Here goes the story. I've known this girl for almost three years; I met her in class and thought she was highly attractive, by which I found out she was dating a guy somewhat steady for almost two years at this point. They were living together, and she seemed somewhat happy from what I could tell. 

Not wanting to come in between their relationship, and knew I wouldn't be able to trust her if she fell for it. I added her as a friend on Facebook after we shared a second class together the next semester, and gradually found out that she was having problems with her boyfriend's lack of motivation to complete his college degree, among other things. Still not wanting to be a douchebag, I filed this away in my memory and made a mental note to see if her status ever changed. 

Over the next two semesters I would see her occasionally, and resulted in a huge conversation) that resulted in me talking about a TON of my past. She continued to act the same around me whenever I said hi to her later that semester, so I decided that I hadn't freaked her out or anything, and then I left it at that.

Last semester (fall 2011) I found out that her boyfriend asked her to marry him, and I moved on from the college setting into an entry level position in a local firm; she stayed on campus studying for the GRE so she could apply to grad school in the fall. I didn't see her after that (because I wasn't on campus), and so that was that.

A week ago, and in the resulting conversation over the past week, I found out that she had pretty much cut ties completely, moved out of his place in a few hours, and had no compunctions against a future without him; she expressed her plans over the summer and fall semester, and he wasn't in them. This leads me to believe her boyfriend cheated on her with another woman (I only can hypothesize, as I didn't ask, IMHO.

So, and hate the thought of screwing this up because I didn't have the patience or know-how to wait for a better time; however, I would literally rather shoot myself in the foot than let some other guy go after her because I was too much of a pussy to take a chance. 

So, that she and her boyfriend broke up in mid January, how long should I wait to go say hi and ask her out to a cup of coffee and start to invest in her?

I was planning on swinging by sometime early this week

I just got back from spending two days with the girl I love.  We had a great time together and we spoke of many things:  the past, most importantly, the future.

She says she's leaving her boyfriend.  To frame what I'm about to say, and I explained that to her openly.  We talked about it again yesterday, and she assured me in no uncertain terms that my admission did not affect her judgment at all.  She is almost certain that she wants to leave him and has been mulling it over since before I ever came back into the scenario.  So there's that.

The way she detailed her intended course of action to me, and odds are that once they break up he's still going to be a part of her life.

So here's my worst-case projection based on what I learned over the last two days:  I show up out of nowhere, she's gonna drop him and probably soon after that she's going to get with me.  

If it looks and acts like a duck

The point at which I have to make some pretty important decisions seems to be approaching rapidly.  I don't want to influence anything in her current relationship

Realistically, I'm pretty sure any discretion I'm planning to employ will be set ablaze and thrown violently from the nearest window.  I'm very conscious of the fact that it's probably a terrible idea, but I'm also incredibly aware of my own shortcomings.  I tend to fly balls first into most every situation life throws at me.

I have a lot of things to consider now.  We live about an hour away from one another and I now know she's planning to leave her boyfriend.  She wants me to come back as soon as possible to hang out with her

A confrontation with her boyfriend at some point has now become a realistic possibility.  He does not appear to have any clue as to what's going on right now

-I have been asked out, but politely decline (edit:due to lack of interest in hook-ups or flings.)

-I'd like to maintain my own dignity for myself &amp; ""that special person"" I let into my life out of respect.

-I see relationships as an emotional connection above all else. Sex is secondary &amp; not a must.

-I would never think of using anybody or form a relationship just for sex.

-I'd consider myself a good person

-I am a very confident

-We have been friends for close to 7 years. She's been my closest friend for 5 of them.

-I never viewed her as more than a friend until the past year or so.

-I would be content remaining as we are now if the feelings were 1-way.

-Our discussions have taken more personal tone in the past several months.

-The most I have done recently as far as expressing myself is telling her she's one of the few people I truly care about

-Prior to stating the above

-Since I stated the above

-I am scared of missing my chance to be with someone I've been blind to for so long that's come to mean more to me than anyone else. 

-I am even more scared by the idea of losing her presense in my life by telling her.

-A close personal friend of hers mentioned she says nothing but good things when I come up in their talks.

-A mutual guy friend

-Also w/o being aware my interest in her

A bit of background information: I've been in two 'relationships' before, along with the fact that, well, given my situation I obviously haven't had much socialization in girl stuff.

I'm stuck with bad hearing for life; according to doctors in three countries, I've been brought up in the hearing world, so I haven't had the option to meet deaf girls. Just think about how many deaf people you know, and then how many of these deaf people you'd date. Yeah, same here.

Anyhow, so I'm pretty sure I come off as a confident person. The problem is, most social situations take place amidst lots of background noise, where I'm forced to shut down regardless of what I do.

I know the obvious solution is to meet people in quiet, but their solutions are variations of 'be more social...' but I don't have a problem with being social (at least as long as I'm the one doing the talking), I just have a problem responding appropriately because of not hearing, or maybe even because I'm still too naive given how much auditory communication I'm missing out on. Or maybe because of the fact that when I try to explain that I'm girl-deaf, girls just find me weird/awkward/gay.

Obviously there's more, I'd at least like to experience one decent 'real' relationship before devoting my life to either med school or academic research in one of the loneliest scientific disciplines known to humanity (organic chemistry). Thanks, dating advice subreddit!!

We had great conversations and I built up courage to ask her if she wanted to see Man of Steel. 
She said yes and seemed very positive. 

The date just ended. We ate dinner
During the movie we didn't talk much, but she didn't grab it. 
After the film we took a walk and talked a lot about everything. 
At last we split up

I feel like I fucked up. It was more like a friendly date rather than a romantic. 
We didn't have much physical contact and we didn't really do much flirty stuff. 

We still both had a great time

Is there still hope for us? 
I really need some guidance! 
I'm sad and confused. 

UPDATE: About 2 weeks has gone by since the date. We have met quite a few times during this time to shoot footage for the movie and etc. I just try to be myself

I pulled myself together
She said she couldn´t because she was going to spend the night before at some friends

At first I just thought that was an exuse

So the history is that I started emailing her, getting some coffee, went to a concert, etc..). 


The thing is that when we meet alone I was very nervous


Finally after a bit more of a year I finally found the strength to invite her for a picnic (yea she is into that) and she said she was busy with work(I know and she knows I know that is hardly believable)


So I did the only thing my heart pointed me to do, but she said she was really sorry, but that kind of things should happen, and they didn't, not interested.


The thing is that I cannot stop thinking about her a minute (literally, I feel as I am not going to find ever that kind of person (I getting older (her too), and this kind of chances are rare or unique), I feel that I can't really give up, but she make it clear she is not interested. 


I feel like we are very similar and compatible souls, because I have been too serious and not fun, and not expressing my thoughts around her.


5 days have passed from the rejection


So


Maybe try to keep her as a friend
  

Should I meet with her and ask her why she doesn't like me

More about her:he is intelligent, religion(or the lack of it)... a bit nerdy, logical-minded.... In the other hand she is a bit chubby so she isn't getting this kind of attention usually (but I like her with all my soul anyway, ohh what a face she has...), and she is vegetarian and I'm not, but I really don't care that much about it


More info about me: Forever Alone, socially awkward, not a single girlfriend in my life (yea 35M and that, it could put some heavy pressure on me), I am 5.7, 170 lb, so just a bit overweight for my country standards(and working extremely hard on improving)

While I eventually would like to settle down and marry, having a public profile, messaging people, and being direct in talking to guys I'm interested in.

However, and I never really learned the lessons that come from dating. Most of my potential dating partners, if any exist, will have that experience. I won't, and it kind of scares me. It screams desparation and ""dating virginity"". I'm afraid that a) I won't find anyone whose personality meshes with mine, and b), if I do

Right now, some days, I really think I'm too old for this. My confidence is taking a huge hit whenever I see those ""I'm 25 and never dated"" posts, because even these people will have more experience than I have now.

When my sister [23f] first became single three years ago the first couple of guys she dated came on super strong, and then seemed to pull away from her once she had become emotionally involved with them. But they wouldn't just dump her, they would string her along, hot and cold, basically just mess with her head. It was really embarrassing and painful for her. Since then she has dated much more level headed guys and always sought to take things much more slowly. One of my girlfriends [24f] went through similar experiences when she became single as well. These guys would be texting her all the time, telling her how amazing they thought she was and then suddenly lose interest and try to make her feel bad for being too needy when they were the ones who had come on so strong in the first place. Her advice to me was to bail when guys come on strong like that too early.

It was my first major relationship and it was an amazing experience. When we met she was 17 and i was 19. There was a level of oneness we shared that was like no other person i've met before. So much love for eachother. I literally thought she was the one i was gonna be with for the rest of my life, who knows. I'm cool with that though because i'm curious too

Anyway fast forward 2 years and 3 months (i feel good these days) and here's the problem: I haven't been able to meet anyone i *really* like yet. There's been flings but nobody has been as breathtaking a connection as my first girl (i've pushed girls who are interested in me long-term-wise away). I find myself missing her when i think about this topic. However here's the kicker: Over the past 4 or so months there's been someone new that has slowly been becoming closer. We had sex for the first time the other night and now things are at a point where we're meeting up on weeknights. She's let it be known she's interested in me. In simple terms - the potential is high that i could make a relationship out of this if i pursue it. The thing is though there's something holding me back. It just doesn't feel as strong as before, but in comparison to last time it sure doesn't feel as ""yep this is the girl, go for it!"" as before. There's also a part of me that is afraid to hurt her down the road once she's become invested, and there's a part of me that sort of wants to sleep around while i'm young and decent looking and try ""all the different flavours"", and learn about sexuality along the way (i *was* in an exclusive 4 year relationship in my golden years after all).

During the days that followed we kept in touch but that lingering fact of her being married bothered me. I told her I cannot offer her a relationship and we could stay more on the ""friends with benefits"" level - she was ok with that.

A couple of days later I decided to tell her over the phone that I do not feel comfortable with the fact that she is married, through text, I realized that she did not take this lightly and proceeded to blame me for ruining what we both had, blaming me for not telling her sooner, giving her high hopes, making her feel this way, and lastly that she is severely hurt. I tried to explain everything calmly but to no avail and I felt terrible afterwards. 

My main query is that, did not disrespect her husband and family, and also did not become that person who would sleep with married women. Which is worse, to break someone's heart, or to become a person that has no respect for the idea of marriage?

In September i met a new girl (21F) at a club. We basically liked each other the moment we saw us and we had sex on the second ""date"" (we met at same club the next night).  
I didn't see much future with her because of that, because this somehow reassured me that she might really be into me. That first week we spent a lot of time together, got to know each other better and met some of her friends etc... all good. 

About 2 months into the relationship with her, had a quick glance and see guys names. 
One time
I asked her about the text at 6am

About two weekends ago, so they are striking up conversation -my girl has her back to me but knows i can see her-... when that guy goes for the ass grab. She didn't instantly pull his hand away nor did i see her get pissed off at him. She did take his hand away but not how i would of liked it. i got angry but thought it best to let her deal with it. I decided to go to the bathroom before doing something stupid.  When i left they were still chatting. 
I come back, sat her down and asked her what the deal with that guy was... big discussion set off and stuff, my mind rushed to all the other nights she has been out alone, etc... she told me she had pulled his hand away and told him she had a BF. but in my opinion she didn't do it clear enough. otherwise this guy would have never dared to just grab her from a group of girls with him. my point was she didn't make it clear to that guy and blow him off instantly.

Now I was dating this girl for the last 3 months. We have gone and had some great times together. She tells me that I show her the best time and she feels like she can be herself around me. I was into her and she was into me. But there has one thing that has bothered me.

Nothing has really happened between us romantically. I was getting kind of concerned and asked her about her story. She told me that her last three relationships ended very badly and just wasn't ready yet. She told me that she wants to commit 100% into a relationship but she cant do that because she needs to work on her issues before she lets anyone in. 

For me this was a red flag and move on but then she said

The last time I saw her before she left she told me again that she would love it I if came up there to visit and she would do the same. Then we basically ended it as friends (she does want to put me through a LDR) and we where pretty mutual about it. Before she said goodbye

Now I normally don't get like this about a girl that I was dating but I'm at a crossroads because

**So my main question is: If I go and visit her in Chicago** (I have never been) **can I rebuild the attraction like how it was before she moved? At the same time how will I know she is ready to go down that path before taking the trip? And is there also something I can do to keep me in mind when she is up there?**

i'm a 24 year old male young professional in an urban setting. used to drink frat-boy style in college, for a number of reasons:

* health
* avoidance of hangovers
* experimentation
* **alcoholism in the family:** the primary reason. it is a current

i haven't had a sip since march. i've still been going out to bars and whatnot on the weekends, without alcohol. when i go to bars at night, i just like to give them a nice dollar or two tip with my ginger ale, so i don't feel like i'm bad for business.

unfortunately this has made me a bit unsure of myself in the dating world. now i know at the end of the day if a girl isn't OK with my sobriety

further compounding the problem, a little darker, you move around a little bit more, you can sit right up next to her, it's good atmosphere. 

so basically

&gt; me: ""hey

we go inside

&gt; me: ""I'll have a ginger ale please""

but what i'm afraid of happening at this point is the bartender, and feeling weird about not giving the bar any money, and just feeling all weird in general.

I'm stumped. 

The general consensus seems to state that I'm not supposed to go looking for a girl. I'm supposed to let it happen. If I'm interested in finding a relationship

I'm supposed to do my own thing and then I'll magically have a girl fall in my lap apparently. Forgive me if I'm a little jaded

If I follow said advice, airsoft and video games. The only girls that play airsoft are the girlfriends of guys who play. As for video games, that's pretty anti-social and I don't see how I'd find someone through either of my two main hobbies. 

I'm pretty introverted and a homebody. I've been going out and doing social things a lot recently, and almost every girl is taken and doesn't have friends they think would be a good match for me. I have very little interest in large social gatherings such as festivals, concerts, conventions, and so on. 

I have no idea how to put myself out there without my motivation of being out there make me appear desperate. 

Obviously

I've had a few LTRs when I was younger

So what the hell am I supposed to do here? Online dating hasn't been successful at all. Last date I went on was in March

So within the past 2 weeks though, blown off. 

All of my messages I would think are normal. No sick humor, not at all something a 16 year old would write, or even a scred of disrespectful or malicious tone. All of them I got a phone number after a back and forth of at least 12 messages or so, just to make sure an interest seemed to have built. I asked just to meet a nice coffee shop in the city (but not the one I love the most so I don't go all super guns at once). All seemed great, and just before each date I texted them just a simple quick check to see if we were still on as soon as I got off work (5pm) to meet at 7:30. All were on, yet, non showed.

I just don't know what to say other than how depressed and ill it makes me feel. I've tried hard to try and put myself back, odd times, and yet all three ghosted away.

Long story short; I was raised very religiously and basically had my sexuality repressed. I dated my whole life, I just felt soo awkward and behind the curve. I would get black out drunk and basically try to pick up girls. Did it a couple times, but I was drunk and it meant nothing to me other than I felt like I was accomplishing something by having sex. Enter this girl...



Everything was going great until we started actually having sex. It was super awkward the few time we did, we don't even know what we're doing"". She kept trying to tell me that we both, obviously, knew what we were doing so it must just be that we're not sexually compatible. At this point I couldn't hold back anymore and told her the truth about my history. She freaked the fuck out. We talked about it for a while, and basically she feels super betrayed and manipulated sexually. Like I lied to her so she would have sex with me, which isn't entirely untrue.



So, but now she feels like she is responsible for me emotionally and sexually, which is obviously not a good thing. So, I don't know what to do. I really like her, and I know she like me, but this completly changes things. Im giving her some space now, but im freaking out a bit. Sorry for the length



TL;DR I lied to a girl I was dating about being more sexually experienced than I am



UPDATE: It's done. Just talked to her and there is no way back.

I probably didn't think past ""Sorry I don't have a phone"" which was actually true since I was on holiday

I would be happy just knowing her name - even if she has no interest in seeing me ever again. I know she also has a tattoo on her back. And yes she is of Asian ethnicity. That is all. Thanks for any help :)

About three years ago I did a critical self examination of my life and really tried to nail down what I was and was not wanting out of a romantic relationship. The result was me coming up with a list of 4 absolute deal breakers. In the time that has passed since then

In its simplest explanation, do clogdancing, moderate a neonatzi forum, surf, or attend art-house films. It doesn't matter much what they do, as long as they have something they take passion in. In a pinch I will even take being a hardcore fan of the Twilight books as being a legitimate hobby.

I am finding that this 'deal breaker' comes up way more often than I would have otherwise assumed. Emails on OkCupid or first date get-to-know-you questions have the disturbing tendency to come up empty.

ME: So what do you like to do for fun?

HER: Oh

ME: Like what for example?

HER: Well

ME: Well what are some of the things you do when you go out?

HER: Just having fun. And doing stuff.

It could be that they are just intentionally being bland because they fear I might get turned off if they announce their kooky odball hobbies on a first date. They want to 'cast a wide net' and are attempting to be as generic as they can manage to appeal to the widest number of possible matches. But I dont think this is the case because it continues even when I try and drill down into specifics.

ME: What kind of music do you like to listen to?

HER: All kinds.

ME: Any favorite band?

HER: Oh I like them all.

ME: Whats one of them?

HER: It would take to long to list them all. I enjoy so much different music.

ME: You don't have to name them all

HER: I cant remember. \*giggle\*

There is one exception I make to this rule of mine. Getting blacked out drunk I do not count as being a hobby. Yes

So now I come to the problem.

It could very well be that these women would make a good match for me. Lurking just below the surface could be a kind generous person who is supportive of me and affectionate and would genuinely care about my happiness. All I would need to do is give them a chance and I would find love.

So what if she is totally empty inside

1329080346.0,pmg7h,Where did I go wrong...?,dmplz,13,2,19,"Hey everyone! So I first want to apologize if this post ends up being a bit long. Anyways

We started texting back and forth occasionally and eventually it became more frequent. After a couple of weeks we got a chance to hang out at a bar and dance the night away again. She would text me stuff like "":D you are too good to be true

Couple of weeks later and I'm driving down 90+ miles to hang out with her for the weekend. The Friday that I arrive

After this we continually talk and text each other and just last week she texted me saying ""I don't want to hurt or offend you, with time I know we could've been something great."" So at this point I tell her I respect her feelings and for her being honest with me and accept it like a man but then she goes back texting me ""Let's fix this, I don't think I will ever meet anyone like you. I don't want to lose you."" So I go with it and try my best to go with the flow.

So we talk/text again for about a week and just this past Friday she tells me ""Idk if I can be everything you expect and need. I just feel like you expect so much of this and it's truly my fault for leading you on but I swear those were not my intentions."" So after this we have pretty cut ties and stopped talking/texting. Now I'm not asking for sympathy or anything but I just want to know where did I go wrong? What did I do to make her feel like I overwhelmed her? I just want to know so I don't make the same mistakes again and make sure that I be careful with how I invest my time and emotions. Thanks a lot everyone and sorry for the long post.

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for all of your advice(s). It's great getting a lot of perspective from numerous people. Just to add a little more information about myself

Also just to add more on to this story

The second part of her text was in reference to me texting something to her that was completely dumb on my part. I said something along the lines of "" You certainly aren't playing when you said I've had plenty of opportunities.."" and after texting her this

I know her since 3 years, despite the fact me being a total moron when it comes to women. She quit 3 months ago and after that we had 4 ""touchy"" encounters.

First time at her farwell party, and the whole thing ended her kissing me(total suprise). We hooked up, nothing happend, cause we were both pretty fucked up. I saw her the following morning at work, but totaly ignored her. I just thought "" well, its a one time thing. dont get to emotional.Forget it she's not really into you."" 

It happend that we met at a concert 2 weeks later. Same ending, went home. No texting from both sides. I didnt want to initiate anything, just thought shes too good for me, because shes the total opposite of me. 

Im totaly nerdy, is supersocial, extremly beautiful and that type of woman everyman wants to hook up with. 

So the third time i ran into her (in a club) things seem to go in the same direction as before, we went to this abonded building next to the club. It was awesome, both ready to get it on. But suddenly she slipped, fell and smacked her head on the floor. Blood everywhere i called an ambulance. I was totally shocked and things went out of my hand, she drove away in the ambulance. I texted her asking if shes ok. She replied immediately and also immediately to all my message the following days. We made jokes about it. 

Three days later we met with some friends at a bar. I was pissed off from work, but damn i was afraid. 

I started to get feelings for her and was afraid to fuck it up. Over the last years I decided to concentrate on my work

So fastforward: yesterday i met her again at a party, we suddenly sat next to each other. I asked about the scar. 
It was pretty huge, and another one, till we finally talked about our last encounter. She was disappointed because i didnt call her and said she really likes me. So we ended up kissing and stuff and made the promise to see each other again after new years eve, because we would both be out of town. We texted all day yesterday, mainly joking about me and her and the head thingy.

I meet guys online mostly, simply because my mother is a law enforcement dog handler and I grew up in household with a sniffer dog.  I have no objections to anyone who enjoys these things and it’s never bothered me in the past.

I tried a couple more times but he never answered, nor did he respond to a text I sent him.  Now I’m sitting home alone, disappointed, and wondering why he hasn’t contacted me.  I’m happy to give him the benefit of the doubt in the event something came up, but it bothers me that he hasn’t at least sent me a text to say ‘Sorry’.

Me 21f

I apologize for the wall of text.

The consensus was that I should talk to the guy and explain my feelings and ask for a relationship. Last time I saw/spoke to him was Sunday and he has ignored me into oblivion ever since then. I have tried to contact him and he hasn't answered; he ALWAYS answers. So we got the verdict: he just wanted to fuck me and I guess he got bored and moved on.

Anyway

He wanted me to read/borrow his books, his friends encouraged the 'relationship' by talking about how cute we were, he was always polite and considerate to me, whenever we drank he would make sure I never drank too much, he always answered my calls/texts, he called me a pet name, and he invited me on a 3day long vacation with two of his (male) friends (I declined

Anyway

Our relationship thus far was MAINLY sexual but I saw nothing wrong with this because that's how my first relationship started and it ended up lasting two years.

He struck me as a very nice, sometimes for two weeks at a time). Also why introduce me to his friends? ""Hey guys, this is my living fuckdoll! just don't tell her lolz ITZ A SECRET!!!11""

And if he did just want to fuck me what's with his jealousy rage? And why not explain to me that he wanted something causal as I was obvious in my intentions (or at least I assumed I was)?

Blah. Reddit, finally, even if it did blow up in my face. 

I have faith he will eventually contact me. What should I say if/when he does?

Him: 25 m

Okay
1st date: watched movie together
2nd date: hung out with his friends
3/4/5th dates all involved sleeping together and alcohol. Also involved his friends.

Now originally I assumed he wanted to date me because he asked me out for ice cream. I was with someone at the time so I turned him down. 2 months later he asked again. I was impressed by his persistence and decided to give him a shot. Turns out I really like him.

I assumed because he took me on that original date and also because he was older and introduced me to his friends that he wanted a relationship, not date me.

I just don't understand why I wasn't included in this switch. I'm in college so I'm surrounded by guys who are interested in me

So

I don't understand how he expects us to be exclusive if it's never going to lead anywhere. I've had FWB before and we had set rules to follow. This guy just seems to expect me to know what's going on. He never calls to talk so obviously I'm just a lay.

I don't necessarily want to stop sleeping with him

At first I just liked having a close friend. I moved to where I live now almost 4 years ago and it's been hard enough to find friends let alone even think of a relationship.
The problem is I started to fall for them and it seemed mutual. I decided I didn't want to just hide how I felt so I let them know exactly what I thought about them.
I got a call today from them saying how great a friend I am and how flattered they are that I think of them this way... but they are just not ready for a relationship and how their life is too messed up right now to get involved. They still want to be friends and made it clear that this in no way changes our friendship.

I need women's opinions. I know what I'd be told if I asked a guy

Long story short, and the way others have reacted when I told them about it (just as bad but in the opposite direction, both made me feel subhuman) I've given up on ever having any kind of relationship, platonic, romantic or sexual. It's not a big deal, I've never had those anyway so I can't miss what I've never had.

And I was fine with that. But every night, empty apartment. There's a part of me that wants it, I can ignore it most of the time, but late at night, when I can't sleep, I find myself browsing prostitute ads on the net. And it's been happening more and more lately.

 Two days later, but what bothered me is I invited him to some plans this weekend with friends, and he sort of denied! Then after the meeting, it's been over 24 hours and I've heard nothing from him via text/call/anything - which is weird to me b/c we've been talking everyday. 

Did I jump the gun too soon? Should I have denied getting with him so soon, but I'm not all about that..I'm a ""in the moment"" kind of person. Was this a bad call? Am I looking into this to much? Should I take this as a lesson and slow it down next time? Do these things REALLY matter?

I'm not sure if it's totally lost..he did make the effort to see me

Update: We spoke, the biggest thing was I probably shouldn't of asked him anything, bc its too soon.. but hey its ok! This is how I learn. Respecting people's emotional space is important.

There is way too much background information to type but that's the general gist of our relationship. Last week we got into a really big fight after we had both been drinking. I had a decent buzz but was definitely not drunk. I decided I was going to get on this website called seekingarrangments and try and meet some guys to talk to. That was very wrong on my part but I was so upset and unhappy after everything and I felt trapped. I kind of am trapped financially. 

Anyways

I stay at a friends for about three days but she lives kind of far and I had to go to work so I went home to get clothes and we ended up talking and decided to still be together and get counseling. It hasn't even been a week and we are still arguing. I love him but feel like he's changed. I think it's my fault he's changed but it hurts. 

It just seems I'm always upset about something and he blames that for how he acts and reacts to me. I really care about him but I'm thinking I just need to move out but I feel like I can't. I am a full time student and work part time but if I moved I would have to quit school and work full time. Before him I had never lived with an SO and always had a roommate or lived on my own but now I feel like I can't make it on my own. Ideally I would like us to just be happy together but I can;t help but think it's too far gone.

I apologize for the story

&gt;I'm on a 3 (pushing 4) year single run. That being said

&gt;So girls on the whole seems to avoid me. I don't have any explanation for this really, more often than not, I just enjoy being around the family, or alone.

&gt;I've asked a few people out

&gt;I was really interested in this one girl (1), but I don't date. You're the first guy to seriously ask me out and I appreciate it, and while I'm not saying a definite no to ever, but I'm not ready for anything serious right now"".*

&gt;I replied with *""Sure, the offer stands"".*

&gt;I asked here, because I had to get my phone repaired. She doesn't have any social networking except for Instagram and Snapchat (which I couldn't get on my loaner Blackberry)... Couldn't really get her number any way other than commenting on something on IG which I didn't want to do, so I just decided to wait til I got my phone back.

&gt;Got my phone back, 30+ pics.

&gt;I explained why I hadn't replied and we have started talking again. 

&gt;**I don't know what to make of this.**

&gt;So recently

&gt;I would like to catch up with her before I make any decisions obviously, but I wasn't saying no, I just wanted to get to know each other again. In a nutshell, I was completely honest.

&gt;She said that she appreciated the honesty and said that she understood and would still like to go out if I changed my mind.

&gt;Also, it's baffling my mind).

I was kinda pissed but eventually we start doing everything you can do from the waist up. I had my period but he tried going down on me many times. When we were getting dressed

She said oh wow when he told her I had called her. 
Then
I told her that these are my last 20 days in the city
Then I asked her for one of her girlfriends numbers, what can I even do? I'd be gone for 2 years. 
Then she suggested a long distance relationship.(It was for her sake)

Background: In high school I was a shy loner type who had a crush on a sweet

Fast forward to now: I've improved my social skills after three years at a big state university. I dress better, basically live the life of an average 21 year old guy. Months ago, this girl randomly comments on something that one of my friends (that she has never met) posted on my Facebook wall. I started catching up with her through a few messages, but she abruptly stopped replying in the middle of a conversation. I thought that was the end of it, but since then I've had some weird interactions with her. She followed me on Twitter at one point, I followed her back, then she unfollowed me like 2 days later; I liked a new picture of hers at one point and she immediately deleted it; weird little things like that. 

My birthday was Sunday and she posted ""happy birthday

So she's interning in New York and going back to a school about 4 hours away from mine in the fall. I'm living at school right now

The question: How can I ask her whether or not i can spend the night without pressuring her to do something she doesn't want to? I think that a direct question can imply sex and make it difficult for her to say that she would prefer if i went home after the movie. She is saying that she wont be able to sleep for weeks after seeing the horror movie so maybe i can say something like ""what if I stayed with you so that you can be safe?"" in a kind of jokingly way. I do think that such a line can be to indirect and that she doesn't take it seriously.

I'll try to make this short

I'm 20, a recurring situation for me. 

I've never had a serious relationship

I used to be arrogant as fuck, other kids) that I am somehow on a higher level than other people. I was overcompensating for my insecurities but somehow I got by when it came to girls, they found me attractive, sometimes, maybe because we were kids and that fake confidence seemed like the real thing to their inexperienced eyes.
I started that type of behaviour when I was 13 and started reading all of that PUA crap. It's bullshit written by guys that are the cringiest

Lots of personal issues went by, but as a consequence all my self-loathing and desperate need to feel loved surfaced. 

Because of that, but it hasn't made me any happier, and added a side of me that I would prefer to have kept hidden. 

I spend my days wondering why every girl I show some interest to seems almost afraid/disgusted by me. Although academically I am currently weak due to my lethargy (I simply can't study/focus) I've always been an overachiever in everything I do, and girls randomly stare at me on the street everyday. I look in the mirror and I don't really like what I see, I'm just telling about the feedback I get.

I know that my attitude is the reason I don't get any real attention instead of just empty looks

Everytime I manage to face my enormous insecurities and try to go for it I end up being rejected and disappointed

After one of the dances, I kissed her on the cheek, and she smiled and blushed. I held her hand on the way back home on the limo. I walked her over to a friends house where she slept over. That's when I asked her whether she wanted to be my girlfriend (big mistake; I know)

She said that she like really liked me and everything

We went and saw Iron Man 3 the other day (she's a huge comicbook fan, I was waiting for her at the theater and I ran into one of her friends. We talked, and she mentioned that this girl really liked me. So while waiting for a ride after the movie, I pecked her on the cheek again, and she simply smiled and blushed. I'm making plans to see her again soon. 

Her and I are going to the same university next year, but then it becomes somewhat difficult to spend time with her.

I really like this girl you guys. She's cute and we share a lot of the same interests. Unfortunately, so I have no idea what she thinks of me or anything. I don't want to move too fast, and come off as someone manipulative. Her last boyfriend from over 3 years ago, apparently tried to manipulate her, and the last thing I want to be is that guy (he's out of the picture btw). People keep asking me if we're ""official"" or not, and I don't know how to answer.

Now if guys haven't already been scared away by this wall of text and drama going on here, and whether or not I should keep this relationship going. If you redditors could take some time and help a 17 year old kid deal with the tip of the iceberg in his first relationship, I would gladly appreciate and cherish it.

1367386619.0,1dgsp9,Might be attracted to a virgin until marriage. I am closing in on 40 and so is she. Advice please!,-Scathe-,15,4,16,"We are going on a second date soon and I am getting the feeling that she might be a virgin who is saving herself until marriage. I am not a virgin and I am not saving myself for marriage because - well that's water under the bridge at this point and - I am not interested in getting married. It's not for me

So I just want to be able to date a woman, meeting parents, or think about having kids. Hell I don't even want to think of all the religious meta baggage that comes along with subjects like virginity at 40 and saving one's self until marriage. I am getting close to 40 and so is she. To have a relationship like that at my age feels like I am stepping back into high school ... in GEORGIA.

I don't want to waste her time or mine by pursuing something that is essentially oil and water. If she really is a virgin and is saving herself for marriage then imho she should try to meet men who are like-minded. How do I even bring this up? This conversation would be super awkward for a virgin approaching 40. We need to discuss to find out what pages we are individually on.

It just feels unfair for me to be burdened with the ideologies from someone else that a. I don't share and b. probably stem from religion. For her I don't think it would be fair for me to just lead her on with more dates and phone conversations knowing what she wants could never come of this.

At the same time I don't want to be labeled as someone purely looking to get laid because nothing could be further from the truth. I really like talking to her and spending time with her I am just too old to go around the ""potential marriage material"" block again-and-again. Shit is dead ... can we still enjoy go out and have good time together or not?

TL;DR Now keep in mind everything I have written above is purely speculative mixed with how I would feel if it were true. I have no idea if she is a virgin or saving herself for marriage. HOW DO I FIND OUT w/o looking like a crass jerk only trying to get laid?

1366882645.0,1d2nyn,I [23M] Feel Like I'm Completely Lost With Women,watifisnotdepression,14,4,4,"**Background** 

Hi, and I have a bit of a background. The first time I asked a girl out I was 16 (she said yes!), and had an on/off 3 year relationship. After the breakup, it was almost 3 years until I ""dated"" again, with a couple of one night stands and a weird fwb deal on the side in between those times. The second relationship lasted maybe 6 weeks, and I was sorta used, sorta not sure about that one still. Seriously




I am still scared at how emotionally immature, and downright annoying I can be. I know I've been an absolutely amazing boyfriend, the kind that sweeps you off your feed romantically, physically delivers in an above average way, and is super thoughtful. The kind that makes you happy.

However,"" clingy. It's different. It's what I would call routine clingy. We start going out, and there's a developing routine. Last time it was compulsive texting by her that got me into the routine of texting every day. Then when it stopped, I didn't really know... what to do with myself. I mean I have a life, but I was used to... the texting. Does that make sense?

Anyhow

**Important Part**

How do... I date? Relationship 1 was this fluke thing that went from one ""yes"" into the typical HS sweetheart yeah right kinda deal. Relationship 2 was... well... let's just say it was fucking weird. I made a bad decision turning a long term crush into a rebound for her because of the words ""I love you"" coming out of her mouth. Don't date ex roomies... especially if you know their bf really well. Lesson learned!

But yeah... how... do I date? I mean

?? My personality type doesn't even seem to exist... but I would love to expand and date anyone.

For instance the girl today

I walked right up to her

Then she was all ""You know I'm in your class right?""

I didn't. But still we talked for a good 20 minutes. I really wanted to ask her out but... I don't know how.

I really wish she would have at least dropped ""Yeah oh my boyfriend..."" if she had one. Chances are though

I will see her obviously in class. How do I go about asking her out?

**TL;DR:** 
*Can anyone give me some tips on how to get into the dating groove? I don't really seem to attract women.
*How do I ask out a classmate? Are there protocols for girls who have boyfriends (as in
*How do I go about searching for a personality type that seems to keep to themselves most of the time?

1366293854.0,1cltgd,I [m26] am going to have my first date ever [UPDATE] [LONG Story],Forever_Alone_1987,13,3,3,"Hello again.
I submitted this post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/17xu0k/i_m26_am_going_to_have_my_first_date_ever/
2 months ago and got really good help so i decided to ask you guys again with the follow up. I'll just continue from there so its best if you could take a little time to read the original thread to understand where i'm coming from.

2 months is probably quiet a long time for a follow up but let me explain.
So i got her number and called her. it was hard to reach her at the beginning because she is working as a nurse and often working late at nights or afternoons and i didnt know her schedule but we worked it out.
I was obviously nervous at first because a girl never gave me her number before with the clear intention of getting on a date. But we talked and talked and i really enjoyed it. After a while i told myself ""OK
Time went by flying and not long after 2 hours already passed and we ended the phone call because it was already late at night.
Even though she send me a text message later telling me that she really liked talking to me i couldnt help myself and thought ""Great

But we continued to talk and send text messages and 2 phone calls later we finally agreed on a day and place to meet. We are seperated by a 2 hour drive if the roads are clear and because of the fact that i dont have a car and she does she said she'd like to come to my area even though i said i have absolutely no problem taking the train so she wouldnt have to drive.
I was really excited and prepared myself like you guys told me to only to hear her say on the morning of the day that we would have met that she cant make it because it started snowing again and she didnt feel comfortable driving in such  bad weather. I didnt really know what to make of it but it was actually really bad weather-wise. And here in germany where i live it snows maybe 5 days/year tops so i accepted it.

After that it was hard finding a day where we both had the time to meet. Because she was working long night shifts again and didnt seem to have much free time. But i didnt want to ignore her so we continued texting and calling each other 1-2 times a week. She was mainly asking for it so she must have at least some kind of interest in me.

But then we decided to try meeting again earlier this month. Again she wanted to come close to me so we agreed on meeting in a ""neutral"" city near me which was actually her idea. Its not that far from me. I went there by train and it took me overall 1 hour to get there. I was fine with that.
I dont know that city too well so i researched a nice little café in the middle of the city on the internet to meet there.

I was already there waiting for her when i got the first text telling me that she cant find the place. I thought ""Hm

I just send her a text saying something like ""Im going home now and im really pissed. But everyone deserves a second chance. Try to figure out what you want and what you're afraid of and if you have an answer call me"" I wrote something stupid to my facebook like ""Fuck women..anyone wanna get drunk?"" and turned off my phone

When i woke up the next day and turned on my phone i had like 3 text messages and an email from her telling me that she really is sorry

I didnt reply to any of it at first and later that day got a message saying that she would really like to call me and explain everything. I agreed.
She told me again that she didnt know why she reacted that way but she was just too shy

Like i said before anyone deserves a second chance and she seemed to make sense

At this point i didnt want to go anywhere far for the possibility of it happening again so earlier this week we met in my city at 9pm. We just walked alongside a river and just talked. I wasnt nervous anymore at this point because i went into it with the mentality of ""Its already fucked up

I actually had a nice time but it was just talking. Nothing special happened it was just like a normal phone call. We did that for like 3 hours and then she drove home.

So now im at a point where i dont really know what to do. Even though we only had 1 date i feel like i know her well because we talked for months now and had  a lot of phone calls.

Everything on the internet about dating i looked up says that you should quickly get to the point. Meet up quickly and go from there. Which obviously makes sense but that ship is sailed for me. Because we know each other so well now i dont really know how to proceed from here. If we would go on a second date where would be a good place to go and how would i avoid getting put in the friendzone? Because that is a place i dont want to be in ever again.
I feel like I'm making myself too much available and the fact that i know she had relationships before and i am completely inexperienced when it comes to women doesnt really help at all.

So yeah. If you somehow managed to read everything i just typed. thank you for your time and hopefully you can share some advice with me. If you found a spelling or grammar error i am sorry but typing such a long text in a language that is not your native one isnt that easy.",,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1cltgd/i_m26_am_going_to_have_my_first_date_ever_update/

I go back to my new home city and sort of cut off communication. But a couple weeks before I come back, ""Well, we need to go out again."" And she said, ""Yes, Fridays and Saturdays work best."" I say I'm out of town next week, but we'll find a day later on. Now, that's what I remember. But when I text her to ask her out again, unless I did something horribly embarrassing that I don't remember

PS maybe it's because of the informal text? But the one time I called her (admittedly pre-date) she didn't answer or call or text back. I just assumed she was a texter exclusively. But I think maybe I should call at this point.

A couple days later she invites me to come to her place to watch movies, talk some more, and watch a movie. Its 1 AM so I decide its time to go home. We hug, which turns into an extremely long embrace. She then walks with me out to my car and another long embrace proceeds.

I go home, and how she had such a strong urge to kiss me, but that it would be unfair to expect me to hold out for her when she isn't sure where she is at emotionally. She is crying and says she feels like she might be making a mistake, and she doesn't want me to disappear from her life, but understands if I feel the need to.

We've still been texting since then and she has largely been the initiator of conversation. She also has let it slip a couple times that ""I cant stop thinking about kissing you."" She has been very open and honest about her feelings and thoughts with me
Important Note about her:
I know she was in a year long relationship with a guy she thought she was going to marry and he dropped her out of nowhere about 4 months ago. So I feel like this might be a contributing factor to her sheepishness.

I am a very cynical man and I have been dragged through the mud enough times when I was younger that I am a little quick to assume the worst. I don't often become attached to most women I meet

Do think its possible that maybe she really just isn't ready yet

Hello there Reddit, quite gay..yada yada yeah you've prolly heard this before but there is more to this Story.

About a year ago I started talking to this guy, find out what his interests are, what he likes, what he looks for and what have you. And through that alone my interest in him only grew. I mean, finding out there is someone out there who seems to be what you want is one thing, I still need to meet the person to see if per chance this individual is worth all the time and effort and planning of long distance. I'm one of those old romantic fools who thinks that distance does not matter for very long, if the feelings are true and the will strong enough there will be a way for that distance to be erased one day. So I took a huge chance and some amount of money to finally go down and meet him. Now mind you I didn't want it to seem like as if I went down there just for him, in Atlanta

Now on the way down I was also driving with my best friend, not the best place to encounter frozen water in any form in a tiny little Nissan Sentra. She was kind of my coach on the way down cause I was nervous as all hell about finally meeting someone that by this point, was on the very verge of fallen for, but not yet ready to step up my game. She really kept my spirits bolstered while I was going down there to finally meet this guy, lord knows she kept telling me to be positive and just be myself. In fact, she stressed those two things constantly whenever I started getting nervous behind the wheel, hell I damn near vomited at one point cause of how nervous I was. 

When we finally reached his place, I seized up, I literally could not drive myself to simply walk out and knock on his door. I wanted to message him but my phone was dead, and I couldn't for the life of me remember his number. She eventually shored up my courage and I got out, knocked on the door, and he answered. 

""Oh hey! I'll be out in a minute.""

Then the door closed and...as first impressions go it wasn't much. I got to see him in person finally (I had seen images before, or phone, you cannot help but to admire the first site of that someone with nothing but your two eyes and the space between them to him. 

Anyway, I got him settled in my tiny car and we went along on our way to the convention, joking about various things, me doing my Skeletor impression with great glee heard from him while I felt like I was making a fool of myself...yet enjoying it. Made a few lame puns and what have you, which I already knew he enjoyed puns to some degree, hence why I thought of all sorts of bad jokes. 

Now at the con, I opted to try and help him out in a rather sly fashion, trying to sneak some extra money into the pocket on his hoody. Sadly he's skinny enough that he felt me trying to plant the cash on him and caught me with a starling smile after my hands were caught quite red. He opted to stay on line and wait till the issue was resolved and got his badge. 

The con itself was quite enjoyable

One night back in the room, tv shows, and past relationships, funny how that fit in there. At one point, as I remember I said that I enjoyed his laugh a great deal, how he always laughed even at my worst puns. HE said something along the lines of how his laugh isn't cute at all...

And then I forgot what I said, didn't react to this. I played it off calmly and cooly and appologized for my sudden forwardness and we went back along with our convention.

Eventually I had to ask about why he didn't react at my show of affection, but didn't want to hurt my feelings. After this encounter I retreated back to my room to think things through, honestly I did cry for a good portion, slept a bit too..I just didn't know what to do about this, my feelings were all pointing towards him and I could not control them well enough to stop me from feeling so shitty. 

Eventually I snapped out of it long enough to enjoy the rest of the con, a big piece just left me. Sure he didn't say he had no interest in me, but my paranoia was spiking like you wouldn't believe. Then my friend, who was also with us on the way back, told me something that gave me hope again. BEfore I dropped him off, He told her that ""I really am something.."" 

With that..I felt like as if I had a shot again..

Though he is in current financial and residential issues, I could merely assist him in finding some other spot but still, I have vowed to help. When I say I am going to do something, I will, its a matter of honor. 

Though the final thought of the story is..

With that first visit to him, what makes him tick, what makes him smile...and all of those things that affect me. I have fallen for him. Now mind you I don't use the three words often, I don't toss them around unless its pertaining to NYC pizza...which I do love. But with him I just feel it, he has caught my interest to the fullest and I cannot simply move on and forget, his voice and his absolutely gorgeous smile still remain with me. I love him....

Reddit, and I ask of your help. How can I show him that I want a true chance at being with him, how can I do this when distance still seperates us. Reddit, he is someone that comes along once in a lifetime and I'm not willing to look closer. (Cause trust me, I have.) 

What do I do?

TL;DR

Finally met a guy I have been interested in for a year at a convention. Fell in love with him

A month or so ago, and she responded ""go ahead, it's been way too long."" I didn't really think anything of it, although I was a bit disarmed, she's a very good looking girl. 

Fast forward to a more recent date, she's on floor, and her leg runs into my foot, and she just keeps it there, which set off some of the probably too sensitive alarms in my head. Later that night, when the living room is packed, we are both on the couch, as well as a lot more physical contact

As the title says, and have finally been in the same place now for around five years.  My job is stable, I am very good at saving money as well.

Social life:
I have a decent number of friends of both genders.  I am not ""friend zoned"" by any of my female friends.  I have no issue making friends

Dating attempts:
For years I never bothered to even try and date... so that accounts for ~5 of 10.  But recently I thought perhaps I should.  I've been on numerous first dates.  None have been awkward.  I have both played the role of the person who talks a lot(if the other person isn't as strong on conversation)  and the person who listens (I once listened intently adding only occasionally bits relevant to her conversation for two hours) and everything in between.  Only once has a woman been forward in saying ""Nah, it never happens.  The couple times it has gone further I've simply become friends with them... and still am.  Not friend zoned because I'm not interested in sleeping with them, but never the less friends.

I don't lack self confidence, but have no problem expressing myself as an individual.
I'm not a ""nice guy"" who expects anything in return for anything either.  I'll pay for both of us unless she stops me
I'm not a clinger.  I don't send creepy or repeated texts

I don't blame society, how have I been unable to even have a girl interested in me at all... even one I wouldn't welcome the advances of.

TL:DR I am by other people's standards a good person

I am firmly in the friendzone with my best female friend. Her and I have a good friendship and I've always been interested in her. We've hooked up a few times over the past couple years but only when we were really drunk. Afterward she's made it clear that she only wants to be just friends. 

Now, she's my best friend. She's my closest friend on campus. I'm much closer to her than I am with any of my male friends. The thing is I don't know what to do. 

I know she isn't interested in me romantically. I don't know if there's anything I can do to change that. Probably not. And I'm fine with that. The problem is that I'm always hanging out with her. We spend time together almost every day whether it is eating together or studying together etc.

I don't like this. I feel like I'll never be able to get over her as long as her and I are hanging out and being friends. I had a long conversation with her about this last semester when I was drunk one night. I told her that we shouldn't be friends. That it was hard for me etc. Didn't work. We hardly went any time without hanging out together. 

This is so hard for me because she is such a close friend. Plus I'm practically in love with her. And when we do go a long time without hanging out I get sad. 

I don't know what to do here reddit. How do I end a friendship of 3+years without feeling like an asshole?

Edit: Here's the main problem. She's friends with my friends. As a group of friends I can expect to see her often. Basically I can tell her I don't want to be friends but it will be hard to maintain.

I've known this girl (N) for about 4 years now. Just this year, but doesn't have many close friends. Now it turns out, me and N are both quite close, where we are quite personal now. Here's where things get complicated, I REALLY like this girl, but I dont think these feelings are mutual. And because of this, I tend to get desperate time, we were talking at lunch, but returns about 10 seconds later. Still a bit awkward


Another thing with this girl, or one of her other two friends (both girls). Anyway, what always seems to happen is that we meet up on the weekend, we both really enjoy our time, and always end up talking that night for a while just about random things. Anyway for some reason, during school she tends not to act as close towards me, and I always seem to piss her off. Then the weekend comes, and the cycle repeats.
Also another thing to consider is that me and N's parents have started to get close, and we both agreed we loved it (this was last weekend). This weekend we're planning on going out for dinner, with her two friends (who are also my close friends).


Her two friends both have told me she has no romantic feelings towards me, we do indeed joke a lot, and sometimes our jokes are along the lines of ""let's get engaged"" or ""when we're married...."" Yesterday she made a joke along the lines of ""let's start our relationship now"". Anyway yea, I really have no idea what to do. I really like her, but she doesn't like me the same way, now I'm afraid our friendship might be in jeopardy because I always end up saying something I regret.

A few days later I text her to initiate a second date next week but she says that week will be too tough. But then she starts getting flaky and dodgy, but then really let it go I stopped trying to show her interest, but wasn't mean or ignoring her either, I just let conversation happen when it happened.

I noticed that, a bunch of us went out after work. I got there later than everyone. I noticed her right away but just ignored her and went to talk with some other friends. After that, she came up to the table, and out of my peripheral vision I could see her looking at me trying to get my attention. When that didn't work she came around the table and hugged me and started talking with me.

After a beer or so I sort of went into DGAF mode and went up to her and started chatting. We were teasing each other like we used to do, and wasn't shying away from my advances.

As the night went on we eventually split up and started talking to other people. And as the night ended I mentioned that I had walked and she said that her car was over to the side. I took what seemed like an indirect invitation and asked for a ride.

She took me home and we sat in the car talking for awhile--my arm just resting on her knee or something. Some how the talk turned to me and my trouble with women, never had a girlfriend, etc.

At some point during this, a lot and we were laughing and joking about a lot of things. At one point I mentioned that I know I'm horribly awkward physically but that I'll get better. To which she responded by telling me I'm super physical and great at letting a girl know that I'm into her. That obviously sort of spiked my courage and I started having my hand on her leg, grabbing her hand, holding her face, playing with and kissing her ears/neck throughout the rest of the conversation. She would smile, blush, laugh

I know she's insecure, that I'd turn around on her (I'm pretty whitty) and make her laugh. She started even trying to give me reasons (which again were all bullshit) why I shouldn't like her and I just kept using whit to make her laugh and roll her eyes. At one point she even exclaimed ""God, you're so fucking cute!"" But her answer kept staying the same no matter how many times I asked.

I even admitted that I wrote a monologue about her. And she asked me to tell her it, that was really good"" with this sort of exacerbated look on her face as she leaned back in her seat. But even after all of that, the answer stayed the same. Mind you, the mood never really changed the whole time, it was really positive despite being turned down about a 1000 times. 

When I finally decided to call it a night, but every sign she seems to give me is that she really is in to me. She's never said we should just be friends, or asked me to stop kissing her, or even asked me to stop asking. So later that night I texted her and told I'm going to keep fighting for her, to which I didn't expect a response and got none.

2 days pass without work and I see her. Obviously it's a little bit awkward

My problem is that I have a hard time with flirting and getting sexual sort of in general because I get scared of it with it being so new to me. I get worried of offending her or something like that.

So all of that to ask 2 questions:

How can I ""appropriately"" touch and flirt and sort of get her aroused while we're working (we're both servers btw so there's a lot of passing by each other in cramped spaces)?

Should I even still be fighting for her or should I honestly just give up?

(Additional info: i'm a 22 year old female).

I've been friends with a guy for over 3 years. In the past I told him I liked him but he rejected me, we've talked a lot (mostly facebook chat), we've gone out 3 times, twice to the movies and also had lunch together, he's paid for pretty much everything, except the last time, because we had an arrangement where he paid for the movies and i paid for a shared pizza for the both of us.

The thing is, he offers to pay, we shared a taxi and he drove me home, also the times we've gone out he always sends me a few SMS's to make sure he got home safe (because I tell him to, i say stuff like ""if you can, please let me know when you arrive home"" and he does). He opens the doors for me, in the movies our shoulders touch and neither he or I move away that closeness. We didn't have that kind of relashionship before, rarely... And of course, so the only reason he was still awake

I invited him to go see 'The Hobbit' with me last week and i plan to invite him again to another place if he doesn't make a move any time soon. But we're friends and he's rejected me before

NOTE: Three years ago, but 3. i was a really fun person (something like that). I confronted him about it a few months ago, told him that he thought i was immature and he said that he was wrong then and had low self-esteem.

 Okay...well, let's call him Michael. I've known Michael for about 5 years now, and recently, things have become more impassioned between us then ever before.

 It all started about a year ago when he came over to my house for the thousandth time. Something was different about him, and being a kissing distance away etc.) he still acted himself, talking wise, but his body language was totally different opposed to at school, around others, and our group.
 
I have two other best friends as well, Rose, Margret and I all hang out together often around our neighborhood. Around them, Michael and I don't act all flirty. We are just our normal jovial selves. Laughing, joking around, and talking like there is nothing going on. Now, because we are a group, Margret and Rose both know that Michael and I have, I don't want to jump into something that may ruin the friendship we have.
 
Anyway, and watching a movie. Then from snuggling and watching a movie, to wrestling, laying on each other, and almost kissing A LOT and watching a movie. Then after those things happened, he started to be flirty with me, around Rose! So far, and same with Rose. When they asked him about what's going on between him and I
 
When Margret and Rose told me that he only thought of me as a friend
 
But there is something else, I would admit that I like him at one point, when he has interest in someone else. Then when I get over him and into a different person, he would admit that he likes me. So, it's just this semi-mutual conflict that we keep having.
 
Recently, but honestly, I don't remember what it was about, or what we were even watching. Michael and I were so preoccupied with ourselves it was uncanny. He was literally all over me, Michael started licking me, (not down there...) playfully biting me, messaging me, kissing my neck, I liked it, ""But before I leave
 
The next day, I like the middle part right now.. They also told me that Michael has to decide on what he wants to do, but the last couple days he hasn't said much about it. I mean, we still talk and stuff, and when I asked him what we are going to do about this, and how he feels about the whole thing. He told me he doesn't know what he's feeling, that he has no clue on what to do, that we might ruin our friendship. He said our friendship is more important to him. And I agree
 
 This is the first time something like this has ever happened to me. I don't understand how to take this correctly, well, weird Y'know? I want to date Michael, but I also don't! I like that we can do things with each other and not be nervous or shy, but I also am afraid that I will change my mind. (teenage hormones do that...) What am I to do???? How are we going to get through this? Any advice on how to get through to him? How to know if he is just being hormonal or not? (like tell me whether or not he wants to date me) or, How I know I WANT to date him? Should I date my best friend? Anything? Please! I am so confused....",,,,

In my 18 years of life I had two people ask me out. Once when I was 16 and once recently

I had my first BF when I was 16 and had to end it because my parents we're strict and it was hard for me to go out on dates with him. That one lasted about 5months and I had to break up with him because I felt that I couldn't give him what he wanted. 

I am no in my first year of university and I have no confidence in my looks. I feel as if it is impossible for me to ever get asked out or have someone I like like me back because I'm shy. 

I've  basically been told that with out make up I'm not going to attract any guys. I am very inexperienced with make up and it takes me forever to do the most basic things. I also just don't have the time for it in the mornings and it irritates my eyes. 

I feel like I'm basically going to be forever alone because I don't have a huge chest like other girls and I play video games quite a bit. 

I think I might get put into the friend category quite a bit because I've always been kind of a tom boy. 

I feel like its hard to meet guys now because

When I'm around new people I tend to wait for people to come to me because I'm too afraid of saying hi. If im around people I dont know I'm really quite but once I get to know someone I become quite out going.

First, I have yet to visit her home. Anytime we are together she is at my place. Third, she is worried about going to places near where she lives due to her friends seeing her. So we avoid them. I get the impression she is ashamed that she is dating someone else since her friends were friends of both her late husband and her. She did however tell me her friends were asking her out (male friends).

There's a lot of flirty/teasing banter and we have common interests (she seems kind of.. ""impressed"" that I'm familiar with/into some of her specific favs). She's asked about personal life stuff

Recently I've also noticed her checking me out. A few of us were hanging around after class one day and some guy was telling this long-winded story. I was paying attention to the dude talking and saw her staring at me out of the corner of my eye. I looked over, and made eye contact long enough so she knew I'd caught her. After she looked away THAT time, I flipped things around and gave her the stare so I'd intentionally be ""caught"" when she looked over again. The eye contact tag's been going since.

My instinct tells me she plans to bail and is no longer interested.

I've liked her since last quarter, so I grew a pair and talked to her and asked her to go see TDKR on Thursday since I had an extra ticket. She said yes. Now flash forward to yesterday, we had a little study session/date where we went out for frozen yogurt and studied together and finished the night at a burger joint for dinner, I dropped her off after. I thought she had a good time. Now today she was saying that some of her friends also wanted to go to the movie, so I checked for her and the tickets are sold out, I let her know and she cancelled on me. Where do I go from here? Do I try to ask her one more time to go see the movie? Like in a joking tone. (I can't believe your turning down a free ticket to see TDKR in IMAX! maybe?) Or should I let that particular issue rest and just try to spend more time with her with things like lunches and what not?

**BACKGROUND**

We have been friends (very good friends) for about three years now. Our attraction to one another has kind of been off and on. For a while when we first met, bad timing.

Anyway

We settled into being 'just friends' and that's the way we've been for quite some time. We hang out (alone together) ~once a week. Longest I've ever gone without seeing him is a month.

**It's gotten more hot and heavy lately**

However, talking about what porn we like to watch, etc. He got turned on and (french) kissed me. He apologized profusely but I told him over and over it was fine and I liked it. We slept in the same bed for the first time that night (no sex).

Almost every weekend since then

* Hang out (we don't call it 'dating' but we have done basically every standard 'date' you can think of)

* make out several times (~5 times per weekend) 

* and then we'll spend the night together in the same bed on Saturday night (wearing pajamas).

Buuuut we never go further. I know he is the type to take things slowly and he doesn't like casual sex. But isn't three months of making out and three years of sexual tension slow enough?

I guess my question is why hasn't he asked me to be his girlfriend yet and what can I do to speed things along? I am pretty positive he likes me. He almost always initiates the kissing and whenever we are together he is hard. Also he does literally everything he can to help me with any sort of problem I have. Spent ten hours putting together some furniture for me

I have tried to initiate and indicate that I would like to go further but I am not quite sure if I've made it clear to him. 

* After one of the first times we made out, the ball's now in his court and honestly I expect him to make the next move. 

* I've also nonchalantly changed my clothes in front of him (he goes crazy and starts making out with me

* While lying in bed after making out, but he didn't say or do anything about it.

Sooo what should I do next? I KNOW I should say something along the lines of 'okay, and neither is he for what it's worth) and I really try to be a sex-positive person but have a really hard time of shaking off the whole ""girls who want sex = sluts"" thing. I just want to get him to initiate.

Can anyone think of reasons he's acting this way? I've thought of micropenis (but after feeling that sucker

Let me explain. I met some friends from work out last night. There's a new girl who just moved to our city, its the most we've talked so far, and I was slowly starting to get that attraction feeling towards her.

Now, I've come to terms with this. 

Enter one of my friends cousins. The guy is LITERALLY a Calvin Cline  model. He's modeled for other large companies too, just to name a few. Think Edward Cullen with a more normal face, lighter hair, and lighter eyes (someone else's observation, not mine). The guy is good looking ok.

Anyway, and asks who he is (I was able to hear this part)

The rest of the night, and she had almost like a puppy dog look on her face when looking at him. Her and my gay friend were practically drooling over him, along with every female in the bar. (both myself and the model guy are straight by the way)

I just spent the rest of the night talking to my other friends

I didn't get pissed at the guy, he was very friendly, a cool guy by my judgement.

So did I handle this ok? How would someone else have handled it? Is there something you all would have done differently to keep her attracted?",,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sxf7o/how_to_handle_rival_thats_insanely_better_looking/

Long-winded details below.**

I'm 23, female. 

I've been corresponding with this girl since the beginning of March. She contacted me on OKCupid

So here's the thing. I'm a reasonably smart guy, throwing out all kinds of pretentious references to see how the other person keeps up, and just having fun. She's clearly just as much of a geek as me, so that's great. When she first messaged me at the start of March, I was still in school and telling myself that I wouldn't have to drop out, and my dating profile reflects that situation of being a normal/ambitious student.

The problem is, and all that sort of thing. She's going places with her life and she hasn't hit a major snag yet.

Me, and so on. I started dropping courses, or failing because I was too lazy to drop them, and ultimately dropped out entirely in my third year for a year and a half, during which time I did basically nothing. Then I went back, and have been slowly collecting enough credits to graduate with a general BA (3 year degree in English) which basically gets you nothing anyway, but at least I could put ""BA in English"" on my resume. However, with just two courses to go

Now, who I see regularly because I'm diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD, decided that I must be depressed as well. This diagnosis wasn't, and still isn't as obvious as you might think since I have never been sad, certainly not remotely suicidal or anything like that. So I've been on Prozac for about a month, and so far have been feeling maybe a bit better, but not that much. It's a work in progress

Now, plenty of issues of her own. Everyone has their thing, no one is anywhere near as perfect as they pretend to be on online dating sites. I'm not that naive. *But*, I think it's reasonable for me to assume that this girl at least has her life together. I have always been drawn to this kind of person, and they to me. I know it could turn out this girl is a whole basket full of crazy or something, but I should prepare myself for the most likely scenario that she is pretty normal.

Anyway

*""So, or too mentally ill--possibly both! Anyway, wanna make out?""*

I say this in self-depreciating jest, it's basically going to come across like this.

So my question, but when one so awesome has come to me, it's very hard to just ignore.

I get that
The second guy (31 m) hung out for about 4 times and got distant and finally ended up basically telling me that he liked hanging out with me but it felt more like friends to him (this one i never had sex with but we did kiss and hug)

I finally dropped the idea that we would get back together after she straight up told me about a month ago that there was absolutely no chance we could get back together now

So I cried, and I signed up for okcupid.com about two weeks after my ex told me there was no chance, and immediately (same day), saw a profile I really liked, and the girl messaged me. We have a ton in common. 

Fast forward, she liked me but wasn't sure if there was a spark, so she told me she wasn't looking for a relationship. So that weekend, when she was out of town, I had a total relapse and cried so hard about being lonely and missing my ex that I felt like killing myself (no plan, no attempt, just a feeling). That has happened to me before when I was much younger

Anyways, and she invited me to sleep over at her house, where we fooled around. 
After that, we could be exclusive now that she felt that this was something pursuing. 

I'm not trying to be shallow, funny, smart, etc.), but sometimes I just don't feel super attracted to her, even though she is beautiful. Sometimes, nearly every day for the past 2 weeks, just sadness. 

I am questioning everything right now. Me and this new chick have been dating for 3-4 weeks, these memories and emotions around my ex just keep popping into my head. Me and this new girl both agree that rushing into a relationship is like rushing onto ice, and we could both get hurt, so we aren't trying to take it too seriously, just exclusively.

1332052519.0,r1sdw,[22 M] How can you tell if you're a bad kisser?,my_3rd_throwaway,12,2,9,"I graduated high school never having even kissed a girl

My second kiss was basically a friend from high school. We were drunk my freshman year of college. She said something about ""giving me lessons"" after the kiss was over

Fast forward a 5 years, texting me every second, and wanted to basically marry me after a few dates. I stopped talking to her obviously. However, at some point while we were hanging out, kissing a little, I then stalked her twitter and saw that she tweeted something like ""i wish you could give guys kissing lessons."" Now this girl was a little crazy, but still the tweet messed with my head. (she did continue pursuing me even after the tweet)

A year later, I went in for the kiss and she turned her head, I kissed her cheek. Date #2, a little peck on the lips. Date #3, we started making out. I was mostly just trying to mirror what she did. She was putting her tongue in my mouth, I did a little bit, but she put her tongue in my mouth more. She bit my lip a little bit. I put my hand on her ass a little and also grazed one of her boobs for a second or two.

I felt like I was easing up and pulling back a little and *she* kept going. She also grabbed me and pressed her body into mine. If you're kissing a bad kisser

At the end of the date

That was last sunday. Then, she did send me a detailed response. You'd think after waiting 24 hours, you could just not respond at all, so it's good she responded. We had a text convo. But, I was trying to get a day set for hanging out next and due to work schedules, we don't have our next date on the calendar yet. She does work odd hours, and I travel.

BUT I'm getting all self consious about my kissing and worried she'll gradually blow me off because my kissing was a turnoff. I can't help but worry I'm a bad kisser because of what those two girls said in the past. Am I crazy? Paranoid? I don't slobber, swirl, or suck. So maybe it's that I don't have 'rhythm' or some other abstract nonsense. How can I know for sure? How will I ever successfully enter a relationship if I suck at kissing? How can I get better at kissing? It's like when you graduate college and all the employers want somebody with experience but you can't get any experience because nobody will hire you because you don't have experience. I don't think I'm bad at it, I think it's pretty simple, but people that are bad at it probably never think they're bad at it.

In love with my best friend of over a year now. We spent time together over the weekend. I stayed over at his house and he gave up his bed and slept on the couch...said he wanted me to be comfortable. 

Next morning I go downstairs to leave and he is awake. I sit down on the couch next to him...thisclose mind you....and all we did was talk. I was too shy to make a move. Not sure if he was too shy to hookup with me the night before or even the next morning. He may not have even been interested in me in that way.

He knows how I feel about him. We talk about hooking up all the time. I chickened out though and didn't make a move. Kicking myself about it now. Not sure if I will ever get the chance again to make that move. 

I want to tell him that hooking up was on my mind while I was there but not sure if I should or not. Don't want to lose my friend or scare him off. Any adivice on where to go from here?

This cute little girl who lives in my residence hall was sort of my friend but she was more like a friend of a friend of a friend

Anyway one day I decided to hang out with her because I just had nothing going on. I sent her a few flirty texts and then she invited me over to her room to watch cartoons (her idea) and make blanket forts (mine).

We talked for a while, butterfly kisses, thumb wrestles general touching and childish games. It all felt very natural and mirthful and fun. We started talking closer and closer until our lips were touching as we moved them to make words.

She caved first. She kissed me and I kissed her back. I got out of a long term relationship (3 years) about 10 months ago

Our kiss turned in to lots of kisses. Which turned into clothes coming off. Which turned into various sexual activities. It was all very passionate. We stopped for a while when she told me that she doesn't do this kind of stuff often

Afterwards we got dressed (the mirth of the night was still alive

**The Aftermath**

I texted her the next day after that and things were still flirty and fun, she said she's busy. I said ""but it's the weekend! save your work for Sunday night!"" and she said that she's just socially busy.

I asked her how many guys she had been with (since she said earlier that she wasn't experienced) and she said ""5. Am I slut now?"" I told her that I never thought she was a slut. Then I asked her if she felt something when we kissed. She said she didn't know. She felt something because she enjoyed it

What should I do/say/feel? I'm really just sort of perplexed where thing went wrong.

We enjoy a glass of scotch, and by 2am it's apparent that we are both a bit tired.

He had dimples and that little hair flippy that was so popular in the late 90s and I just fell instantly in love. For the next three years my awkward self tried to position myself next to him in every class and during every game of gym Red Rover (we got to hold hands!!)
We became friendly but never saw each other outside of school and even though other people in our school dated, I realized I was kind of over it.

Fast forward two years: he calls me out of nowhere and tells me he was always in love with me and too nervous to say anything.  I go from 0 to Ecstatic in like 0.2 seconds and (as a new, agrees.... Stands me up.  Calls next day to apologize but says he's afraid my expectations are too high and refuses to see me.  I tell him to STFU and we meet up, talk, walk around.  We go on about 5 little conversational date things, some where I ask first, some where he does.  Then one day, he says he'll see me tomorrow evening... and stands me up.  I call his phone
Eleven months later, keep walking.  Then a week later I see him on my block again.  And then again.  I send him an email asking if he moved to my area and he replies that he just likes to stand there and absorb the atmosphere sometimes.  From that point on, he has long conversations with himself in my gchat window while I'm asleep.  I wake up mornings and read the transcripts and wonder if he realizes Im never there.  Then that suddenly stops.  We don't talk for another year at all.
Two months ago, that's he's responsible, that he's turning his life around and really wants me in it. He tells me he will go anywhere to meet me and randomly shows up outside my job without me asking.  I'm busy and have to send him away without seeing him.  Finally, after weeks of him asking, I agree to meet up for coffee.  He tells me he's running late an he will call as soon as he's around.  
I have not heard from him since.

2. M1 tells me she has car trouble and needs the weekend to take care of it back home with her dad. I don’t hear from her the whole weekend. 

3. I decide that I do want to see someone that I’ve been messaging simultaneously on OKC. Send out a message to L2

4. See L2 again Saturday. Lose my v-card. We talk about what we’re looking for. We’re both looking for a relationship. Unfortunately, we keep texting. We decide to see each other again Monday.

5. At this point, then to me that signals non-interest. 

6. Come Monday, and she left her phone back at her own place so she wasn’t able to text me. I respond. Friendly texts back and forth.

7. I see L2 that night. I have resolved to come out with this situation. I’m too much of a coward/asshole to do so. End up having sex again. I tell her afterwards about M1

8. At this point, I would have probably seen M1 for sure no matter what because it was a totally innocent mistake about the phone and the car situation, and I was very interested in seeing her again. 

9. On the other hand, cut off contact with other OKC guys, because of me. I feel like shit. I wish she hadn’t done that. I feel like maybe if I hadn’t pushed things on Saturday (sex) that this wouldn’t have happened.

10. I can’t be totally happy in this situation. I’m still thinking about what it would be like to keep seeing M1

My thoughts:

1. My ideal situation would have been that L2 was also seeing other people and wasn’t so attached to me

2. I told L2 that I would cut it off with M1

3. L2 tells me she’s already bought me a V-day gift. Apparently she sees a deep connection between us. I can’t disagree. We talk easily. We’re both attracted to each other. 

4. **I think it stems from my being an FA for so long.** I want to know what I can do. I want to know that I can attract women

For the understanding of the story

Back in November I went to a friends birthday party where nothing too crazy was going on, just being my jovial self and chatting with whomever).  When the party begins to die down, and The Girl and her friend leave.  End first encounter.  My thoughts were pretty much, ""She was cute and pretty cool.  Ok, time to help clean up"".


Two months go by and spouse #2 has their birthday party extravaganza.  To give an idea of the group, we all go play Laser Tag (which was epic and amazing in and of itself).  Once we all get to the Laser tag place, lo and behold, The Girl is there with her friend.  I am not ""OMG SHE IS HERE!!!111!"", but I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly enthused to see The Girl.


During laser tag and after, work, life...etc.  Come to find out, she is actually relatively new to the area by about 5 months.  She came up here for a job, and knows my friend (spouse 2) because they all go to the same gym.

Upon meeting, laughing and smiling the whole time. Things seemed to be going well, but were progressing really slowly. There was definitely some tension between us, to the point where things were a little bit awkward during goodbyes (like both of us were just nervous).

A little background on our dating history is relevant here. This last August, and in all honesty, I'm still dealing with it a bit, though I'm starting to get to a really good place. As for her, she also ended a serious relationship this last summer, and it's been really hard on her. I heard this from her and her roommate (my friend), and it's something I can definitely understand. It sounds like she got burned pretty badly.

So anyways, she told me that she has a blast spending time with me and doesn't want that to end. She also really drove home the point that this doesn't have anything to do with me and that as this point she's just not ready. Right now, we've agreed to be friends and are continuing to spend time together.

I know the obvious thought is that she's just making excuses and friend-zoning me. Maybe this is the case, so I'm willing to be friends with her. She's a cool person and I'm not the kind of person to cut someone out of my life just because I can't date them. Obviously I'm still interested in her, but I want to make it clear that I'm not going to be a doormat or hold my breath for her.

However, besides for the class we have together, maybe we'll hang out once a week). Is it possible that not being ready for a relationship is really the truth?

I'm 19. I'm a heterosexual guy. The thing is

I think I can see how being a nice guy just isn't attractive to most women. Fair enough. I still don't want to read up on seduction just to get my dick wet.

Nothing makes me happier than making other people happy. I can ignore the ape inside me that just wants to fuck around and compete with other males.

I've read that I should just be myself but I've also read that nothing will happen unless I do something about it. If doing something means practising with seduction to appear sexually attractive

Me: 23/F

Okay

I'm not quite sure this is the case here

Guy in question has told me how cute I am many times. He also constantly gets hard around me -- basically every time we hang out. He has done things like rub my butt and tell me how cute I am. He has given me extra-long hugs full of rubbing

So you see what I mean? I definitely thought he was attracted to me. It took me some time to warm up, our schedules got busy and we did not see each other for a while (couple months). 

When we hung out again, and his excuses were along the lines of 'I never want to lose our friendship' 'I'm still scarred from my previous ex' (they broke up well over a year ago at the time of this conversation).

I should add that I don't think my personality is the problem either. There might be aspects he doesn't like I suppose

So, we get along great, I'm just as smart as he is, we have great conversations and we have lots of fun together -- yet I've been friendzoned.

Could it be that he is doing some sort of weird playing-hard-to-get thing? 

Is it even slightly likely that he's still messed up from his crazy ex even when they broke up two years ago?

**I broke up with her. There were tears. It was sad. The end.**

I need some help thinking about my current relationship situation. I think it might be too speculative to bring up with my girlfriend at the moment because she's never given *me* any reason to question her. There are **so many** questions I have for her though! Please help me sort this information and make some sense of it. 

Current Situation: 
I met my girlfriend about 3 months ago just as we were both graduating from college. We have since moved back in with our respective parents and now live about a 2 hour drive away from each other. We see each other 1-3 days per week depending on our schedules. We get along extremely well

Me: 
I have very little relationship experience. I've only slept with a few women, supportive disposition, and I don't think I'm prone to jealousy, but I need some assistance in thinking through this situation. 

Her:
She is incredibly smart and logical, and loves to cuddle (I never realized how much I enjoyed cuddling until I met her). She has a wonderful, supportive family. She loves her cat. She loves to paint. What I'm trying to get at is she is amazing. Everything about her is everything I have ever wanted in a girlfriend. She recently surprised me with tickets to one of my favorite bands for an early birthday present and I had the night of my life. She is absolutely adorable, but there is one thing that's always stuck in the back of my mind...

The situation:
I met her under strange circumstances. She was a friend of a friend that I met in a casual bar while I was hanging out with friends. She was very sweet and friendly and we got on really well. We drank a bit too much

Everyone left eventually, we were making out. Then we're having sex in the living room! I couldn't believe it. I walked her home at 5 am and we exchanged numbers. We managed to hang out almost every night for the next week despite still having work and school. I was in heaven. 

We went to a party together the next weekend with some mutual friends. We left early to... go to bed. I got a text from one of my best friends saying that he needed to talk. I thought he meant he had an issue he wanted help with

It turns out she had a boyfriend at the time. She had been hanging out with me for a week straight, but still it's unnerving. 

Then I found out she had cheated multiple times on multiple boyfriends. She had cheated 4 times on her boyfriend at the time, but the fact that she'd made a contest out of it. 

A terrifying example of her cheating happened in Vegas (of course). She was with her boyfriend and some friends. She was dancing at a club with her friends when a guy came over to talk to her. He gave her his number and went on his way

I just got really light-headed writing that last part. Whew. 

I learned all of this (and more if you can believe it) after a week of hanging out with her. As soon as I heard all of this from reliable sources

The night after I learned all of this, to be honest. Over the course of those 24 hours between hearing those stories and seeing her again, I had convinced myself that she was a heartless monster and a social chameleon. She was crying pitifully and I felt bad for her even though I was trying hard not to. She claimed that no one had ever confronted her about this, and she knew it was awful. She didn't seem embarrassed, surprisingly, but she seemed upset that everything had been laid out so plainly before her. She said that she was a very logical person, and in her previous relationships she had never had a reason *not* to cheat. She never saw them going anywhere and figured they would eventually end anyway. 

She broke up with her boyfriend and started going out with me (officially

I was in no way trying to tie her down; I told her straight-up that I liked her and wanted to be with her, but I've always felt that people don't change unless they absolutely have to. 

I feel like I'm almost bashing on her right now. Let me clear the air a little bit, specifically, anything to worry about beyond what she's done in the past. 

I have to be honest, friends of friends, acquaintances from high school, etc. That doesn't bother me. It's the ease with which I, and many other guys, found myself sleeping with her and calling her my girlfriend. It's really strange, I know, but there you have it. 

Right now it's difficult to imagine any future with her despite us getting along really well, I *did* meet that side of her... on that very first night when she was so cute and sweet and seemingly innocent. I'm scared shitless. What if my paranoia ruins something wonderful? I've mentioned before, I'm not generally the jealous type, but this sort of thinking is doing me in. 

She's said on a couple different occasions when the conversation has taken an awkward turn

What is scary to me is that I'm totally prepared for if she cheated on me, I'd hate to ruin the love we share because I'm uncertain about her side of the bargain. 

If you have any advice or questions to ask, those bits are probably even more confusing to me. I'm not looking for a cure-all solution. I really just need help consolidating the information that I have and clearing my head. Just writing this down has made things a little clearer for me. Every time I see her I can't help but grin like an idiot on the outside and cry a little on the inside. 

Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.
