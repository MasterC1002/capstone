1369074014.0,1epi9r,Debian wheezy makes a surprisingly awesome desktop :),bwat47,69,2,44,"I've never really tried pure debian before

It is a little trickier to install and setup than ubuntu or other similar distros (but not really that difficult at all, installing system-config-printer, and tweaking font rendering so it doesn't suck).

The thing that suprised me most was how well wheezy works for multimedia. Out of the box it played mp3, this is even better multimedia support than ubuntu has out of the box! I wish more distros would follow suit here.

The desktop is very stable and quick, like randomly crashing when mounting/unmounting them or sometimes giving pointless gvfs errors when unmounting shares. ubuntu's patched nautilus 3.6 is even worse, its introduced a bug that upstream nautilus doesn't have where it randomly ""loses"" my bookmarked shares. And nautilus 3.8 has a bug where it randomly crashes gnome-shell and sometimes even totally crashes gnome). Wheezy's gnome 3.4 desktop has been super solid for me, I've noticed no annoying problems with gnome-shell or nautilus. And honestly after using debian's gnome 3.4 for a week I can't think of a single thing I really miss in 3.6 or 3.8 that really compels me to upgrade from gnome 3.4.

Everything that I use this laptop for is working wonderfully in debian 7, gnome-shell, kde etc... become bug free enough for me to use without pulling my hair out 

The only problem I had with wheezy is that it came with a very old kernel that hates my ivybridge graphics, card reader, etc..) works just as well in debian as it does in 13.04, and an official kernel 3.8 backport should be available soon.

&gt; Christian Perrier noted that Debian bug #690000 [3] was reported last
&gt; Monday
&gt; interesting reflections on the decrease in the bug reporting rate in
&gt; Debian: according to Christian
&gt; ""Wheezy"" but could also be the symptom of a decrease of the overall
&gt; activity in the project [4]. Don Armstrong sought a confirmation of this
&gt; theory
&gt; that while there certainly are specific periods of time with a decline
&gt; in bug reporting
&gt; bug reporting in Debian which has been happening since 2006"".

&gt; 5: http://www.donarmstrong.com/posts/bug_reporting_rate/

According to [the graph in link 5](http://i.imgur.com/g13dN.png)
is actually an on-going 6-year trend. I honestly believe Debian is the
greatest OS there is -- truly *the* universal operating system -- and
I really depend on it for my productivity
concerned. What can I do to help reverse this?

Is this really a sign that the project has been losing momentum? Or is
it a sign that the core packages have matured such that bugs are fewer
and less severe?

I wonder if Ubuntu has something to do with it. Perhaps more bugs
being reported to Launchpad and fewer of them are falling through into
BTS.

As you can see, the irony...) has forced me to use unofficial ports, and rather than having all the packages maintained by one umbrella project, I have to use three separate projects, each of which will refuse support for the other two projects despite being almost identical technically.

I've had minimal experience with Debian on my friend's home server and for a little bit on my old server, I've heard a few rumors about Debian from Arch users; can someone please debunk these so I can understand Debian further?

1. Does Debian often drop support for an architecture? I may buy some obscure computers down the line expecting to run Debian on them -- It would suck to have to use a deprecated version.
1. For MIPS and ARM
1. One of the most common complaints about Debian from Archers is that the software is old. I've been told that even in wheezy, but the packages are old nonetheless. Is this true? If I use sid, will my packages be just as up-to-date as Arch's? Will I still be offered as much support on the mailing lists / IRC if I use sid?
1. One thing I like about Arch is that they in general make as few as possible changes to packages from the upstream releases. This makes getting help from upstream a lot easier
1. I can see that Debian is currently a long way from becoming a FSF-endorsed free GNU distribution, unfortunately the answer is probably ""no""...)
1. I read once that most Debian mailing list posts are responded to within 15 minutes. Although I prefer to use IRC for support when possible
1. Arch has a large ""hip"" following, and it makes me feel like I'm part of a community more. Maybe this is just my high-school sophomore self speaking, but Debian's community seems to be much more serious in general; is this true?  
1. This a more specific question
1. The home server I built was technically a gift to my brother, is getting it to work and updating it that much of a pain? Is gaming on Debian as easy as it would be on Ubuntu?
1. On our amd64 box we have an NVidia GTX660

That's all I can think of for now... Sorry for my many questions and thanks a lot for taking the time to answer them.

EDIT: I'll put questions I think of after the OP here.

1. I find that often times, etc.). Is the same true for Debian packages?
1. I've heard that really popular packages like MATE and Cinnamon aren't packaged for Debian -- Why is this? Is this a case of them not being packaged for stable only (understandable IMO) or for all versions? Is there a better way to install these packages other than installing from source code directly?
1. If I come across a program that hasn't been packaged by Debian yet, most people prefer that you orphan a package if you're not going to actively maintain it) -- Does it require any reputation in the Debian community to add a package to the repositories? I don't really have a lot of time to maintain packages myself -- Would it be looked down upon in the community if I orphaned packages as soon as I put them up?

I've been using Linux systems since late 1999, then Lubuntu when I realized that the first thing I did after installing Ubuntu was to remove 25% of its packages.  I find however that as Ubuntu ""evolves"", the quality of my experience goes in the opposite direction.  I've had more crashes, slowness, and excessive memory usage in the past months than I can ever remember.  I've decided that I want to go back to Debian, but I'll need some refreshers on some things if you don't mind:

1. I know stable is considered rock solid, Firefox, Chrome and Emacs 24 are at the top of my important to be recent list.  I don't recall having done it in the past, but I think you can specify which branch (here, unstable) to get some packages from, can you not?
2. Because of Ubuntu's rising popularity


**UPDATE:** so I went ahead and downloaded the Debian 7.0 LXDE Live CD.  Since that's the environment I used with Ubuntu

At the suggestion of some people in this thread, I am back with a complete system!

Only thing remaining: trying to get fonts to look a little nicer in Chrome.

a basic rundown of what I'm having trouble with;

-I have no idea how to install files, because well..I don't know how. Also .run files, so I'm stuck unable to install the nvidia drivers for my gpu.

-After I've run a command in either root terminal or regular terminal, or to even get a response from terminal ie typing gibberish and telling me it doesn't recognize what I typed.

-Can't install steam because of the 'jockey-common' issue. did a google search and found this page;

which then pointed me here;
https://github.com/GhostSquad57/Steam-Installer-for-Wheezy

The problem with that page...I have NO idea what to do there. I clicked both links on there

-Again
chmod +x file
sudo /path/to/file

Hi Debers? Debianers? Debianists?

I have a bit of a problem. Apparently somebody decided that 'make' should not be included by default (unless you download 25gb of DVDs?). Questions aside about who could make that decision

I can't build my ethernet driver without make.

I can't get make in Debian without downloading 25gb of DVDs or manually downloading 500 dependencies. 

I'm attempting to move from Slackware to Debian because I want to try the automagical package and dependency handling.

Anyone have any ideas? Thanks! :)






**EDIT**: Many people have given solutions and I think I should have no problems getting things moving this evening. Thanks for all your suggestions!

**EDIT 2**:
_Outcome_: Okay so eventually got this working. As people were pointing out below the DVD included build-essentials... but its something you have to install separately after the initial installation.

_Remarks and Going Forward_: Coming from my previous distro (and only experience with nix) it didn't even occur to me that one would have to install it (make) separately -- let alone there exists an entire repository of *unused* debs on the DVD. The only nix system I've used before is Slackware and there exists at most several ""extra"" packages on the install media. It seems I've equated its install process as being characteristic of nix distros in general which was certainly not the case here.

My original post could have been more helpful (mentioning I was x64, etc) but was initially only aiming to get general ideas on where to go and was not expecting such a large community response.

Is there a way to modify the net-install-firmware image to include a newer kernel? I read the debian docs regarding compiling newer kernel versions

Bulding the drivers afterwards is not an option because the controller in question holds the system disks.

Any hints?

Update: I almost managed to do what I wanted. Here is my rundown:

* Boot with wheezy beta2 net-install
* Expert/Rescue mode
* Don't select root drive
* Drop to shell
* Partition / LVM manually
* follow [this guide](http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap)  (chroot stuff)
* add [stable-backports](http://backports-master.debian.org/Instructions/)

Software:

* OS: Debian Testing 64-bit

* Kernel: 3.10-2-amd64

* nVidia driver: 325.15

* OpenGL: 4.3

* Xorg: 1.12.4

* Gcc: 4.8

* Display manager: SLIM

Hardware:

* Processor: AMD FX 4100 Quad Core 3.60 GHz

* RAM: 8GB DDR3 (1333 MHz per card)

* Graphics Card: GeForce 650 1GB GDDR5 (**NOT** the Ti version)


On to my issue; as you can see I should have no problem running this game based on my hardware. When I start LFD2 everything loads up just fine; I never had an issue with that. My main issue is and this is random; when I go to load into an online server it's 50/50 whether the game will crash or not. If it doesn't I can play the map until the end at 60 FPS


So this lead me to believe that I am missing an important lib file and/or another package. The reason I say this is because before I could install the nVidia driver I had to install ' **lib32z1** ' so I could install the 32-bit OpenGL files; and had to install ' **lib32gcc1** ' so Steam could utilize the 32-bit gcc files.


I searched for the last few days looking for any other libs and/or packages I may need; but I can't seem to find any and that is why I am here. I would just like to know if I am correct; and if I am how do I figure out what package and/or lib file it is I am missing. If I am not correct where should I direct my attention to?


Please let me know what other information you may need and I will happily provided it. I am still very new to Linux (only about a year and a half in) so please be gentle.


Thank you for taking the time out of your day for reading this. 
 

P.S. I searched online (first rule) and just could not come up with anyone else having this problem. All my other steam games work just fine; no issues; but then again they are older than LFD2. 

Also I am running Debian on a 128 GB SSD (6Gb/s; Read/Write over 500 Mb/s) so I have this game installed on a 1TB HDD (7200 RPM 130 Mb/s read rate; don't know write). Don't know if this factors into anything.

**EDIT:** Grammar and Spelling

**EDIT2:** Thanks to /u/Delinquenz I found the solution to my problem; it was a flash related problem. I created a syslink from my libflashplayer.so and put it in my ~/.steam/bin/plugin folder. Gave myself the user the permissions to use it and now all is working fine.

Now I just need to fix my add-ons being displayed incorrectly; but that is for another topic

Thank you all for reading this and thank you /u/Nemoder &amp; /u/Delinquenz for your time and help.

**EDIT3:** I was still experiencing the crashing; but not as often. So I dug a little deeper knowing what my issue now is.
I found that it is best to put the syslink libflashplayer.so file in ~/.steam/ubuntu12_32/plugins then making it executable.

I did as mush rigorous testing as I could by joining a lot of servers and so far not a single crash. Will keep people posted if any new issues arise. ",,t5_2qhkk,1376437471.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1k9jdp/needed_files_to_run_left_4_dead_2/

**SOLUTION WAS TO DISABLE PRIVOXY AND THEN RESET THE CACHE MEMORY**

Ever since I ditched Ubuntu and installed Debian I've had problems with gifs whenever I use Iceweasel. Most gifs

So anyway I did a little experiment and something seems to have come up.

The first thing I did was to access a gif on the net that didn't work on Iceweasel. I then saved it to my desktop and used Ristretto and Image Viewer to access it. It was still non-working and corrupt. I then pasted its desktop location into the URL field of Iceweasel. Again no workee.

The second thing I did was install Chromium and go to the net URL of the gif. It works. I save the gif to my desktop and then open that new gif with Iceweasel. IT WORKS. It also works in Ristretto and Image Viewer.

So obviously what is happening is that Iceweasel is unable to properly access working gifs from the net

To make things even more interesting... I use the Iceape Navigator (Debian's Seamonkey) and

I use Privoxy. So I disabled it on Iceweasel and thus had the net being accessed without a proxy. I clicked on the gif's net URL and... it still didn't work. So it doesn't have anything to do with Privoxy AFAIK.

So I would imagine that there is something between Iceweasel/Iceape and the world wide web which prevents properly rendering gifs. Whatever that thing is

I run Debian Stable (Squeeze) 6.0.5 and Iceweasel 3.5.16. I'd love to use the most recent Iceweasel backport but I can't seem to install it either in Synaptic or via a command line apt-get.

I also have some media files sourced from Debian Multimedia

Maybe another solution would be to upgrade to Wheezy unstable and see what happens. How do I do this by the way?

&gt;I have a samsung n150. Trying to install Debian.

I've tried non free but that requires a network connection - Which I can't connect to my wifi and dont have an ethernet cable - and that install just asks to setup my wifi.

I just tried the dvd version hoping that would have my drivers. Didn't work.

So I download the non-free firmware and extracted my rtl8192e driver folder to my phone. I connect that via usb but it doesn't recognise that either.

Anyone help at all?

Essentially I seem to be stuck in the void of installing Debian but needing my wifi drivers which it doesn't recognise if I connect my phone.

1357327339.0,15yqmk,Best method to migrate a system from 32 to 64 bit? (multiarch support),elivs,7,1,5,"**TL/DR**

I would appreciate advice on migrating from i386 to amd64. I don't want to do a fresh install because I have dozens of packages that would take hours to re-configure on a fresh install. What is the best method?

**Details**

My home server was first installed around 12 years ago with stable/potato. Over the years the machine has tracked either stable or testing and now runs wheezy. Obviously I have upgraded the hardware a number of times. I've also done the manual work to keep the system using most of the ""latest"" advances. eg. LVM

The current hardware is a intel 32/64 bit CPU running a 32 bit 686-pae kernel. I'd like to move to a 64 bit kernel (amd64). Re-installing and then re-configuring all the packages I have running will take days of time as I have heaps of services running (apache, media sercer etc etc). I figure there has to be a better way to do the migration.

I'm about to move to an SSD drive for the root partition and I figure when I copy the root partition across to the new drive this will be a good opportunity to do the 32 to 64 bit migration. I believe its a good time because if something goes wrong I'll be working on a copy of the system and I can have other drives (/home /backup) physically unplugged.

What is the best way to do the migration?

[This page](http://wiki.debian.org/Migrate32To64Bit) describes a method for the migration in which you overwrite the core binaries with binaries for the new architecture. Then use apt to re-install all the packages with the new architecture. I feel happy attempting this but there may be a better way. 

However

1.  install the amd64 binaries alongside the i386 binaries
2.  boot an amd64 kernel
3.  remove the i386 binaries.

Any advice or experience would be appreciated.

Got Debian Squeeze rock'n'rollin' - but now I'm working on getting Koha (it's library system catalog/backend software) installed on the box. I've gotten to the bit where I'm installing Perl dependencies that Koha needs. 

There were over 30 dependencies and I've gotten all but 3 to successfully install from CPAN. One in particular: 
[PDF::API2::Simple](http://search.cpan.org/~redtree/PDF-API2-Simple-1.1.4u/lib/PDF/API2/Simple.pm) wants to install to a directory that does not exist. 

    sudo cpan PDF::API2::Simple      
(that's how it's referenced to be called)

So

Is this a normal thing? How would I even go about solving this problem? 

I have located the Install.pm file that the CPAN install process is looking for but not the place (inc/Module/Install.pm) that the process coming from CPAN is looking for. 

So

My guess is that my folder structure is messed up somehow or maybe I didn't probably configure the Makefile.PL in Koha or something else properly.

1333988342.0,s0yg8,Problem with gateway when installing ShoreWall and DNSmasq on Debian 6.0.4.,MuppetPastor666,6,0,35,"Hi. I have a problem with installing ShoreWall and DNSmasq on Debian 6.0.4. 

(Updated question and info from /r/24hsupport

I am running a 100% clean 6.0.4

My purpose is to run this machine as a firewall between my LAN and the ISP routermodem.

Anyone have any tips Or have this done before? I followed the docs as well as I could:

Basically

*     Turn startup to 1 in dnsmasq.conf
*     Uncommented the DHCP line in dnsmasq.conf to enable DHCP 
*     Set IP-FORWARDING=On in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf (The default setting was 'Keep'. Don't know what that meant.
*     Run ""insserv -v -d shorewall""

my /etc/interfaces looks like this: 
*(Infact eth0 is eth1 on my machine

* (the usual loopback stuff dont remember exactly)
* allow-hotplug eth0
* iface eth0 inet dhcp
* allow-hotplug eth1
* iface eth1 inet static
* address 192.168.1.1
* netmask 255.255.255.0
* broadcast 192.168.1.255

And that should be it.

I checked /etc/rcS.d/ and ShoreWall is started *after* Network Manager. (Though both eth's are unmanaged)

Since I followed all the Debian howtos for ShoreWall and dnsmasq
I tried restarting ShoreWall and dnsmasq and networking in different orders
I get no error messages either during system startup or during restaring the programs.

What am i missing? Please help! Been working on this for weeks now and I have a feeling it's just one little detail I am missing.

One thing I should mention is that the netinst image of Debian 6.0.4 detected my interfaces and asked which one would be the primary one. I chose eth0 like its supposed to be. (eth1 is connected to the LAN)

But then I went for installing the DVD ISO instead and it too asked the question about which interface should be the primary. Only the DVD version seemed to think *after the installation was complete* that eth0 was the ~~internal~~ LAN interface and eth1 was the external interface.

Is this some sort of bug? Should I reinstall with the netinst version

BTW:When configuring all this

Also should mention that I have internet access from the box it self and it delivers DHCP to the LAN
                        
I have a working IPCop solution running now but I also want to use that computer for more than just firewall!
Thanks for any help.

tl;dr: Both eth0 and eth1 works out of the box
 
Edits: ~~Typos~~

Edit2: To clarify

Edit3: At one point i had the LAN clients talking to each other

**UPDATE:** Ok

Then something happened.
It seemed like my LAN clients was getting DNS lookups but the connections timed out. Also it looks like DNS masq isnt running properly

I set the range to 20-40 and IPcop has from 50 and up so my eth has just retained that ip. My Windows client still thinks it has no Gateway. But instead of getting ""Server not found"" i got ""Server is taking too long to respond"".... 


**UPDATE:**
Reinstalled clean
Installed dhcp3 instead of dnsmasq
Shorewall still will not forward traffic...


**UPDATE:**
If you follow me and krakken's thread you will see that I have everything working now EXCEPT for DNS from the LAN side. I can ping and access internet trough IP from the LAN.

Though I am considering trying out Zentyal instead if I don't get this working soon.

**UPDATE April 15th:**
Tried Zentayal on the lappy
Installing Zentyal on a stationary box I hacked together to see if that works better!
Zentyal in VirtualBox was bliss as fresh blueberries though.

**FINAL UPDATE THREAD CLOSED**
I installed Zentyal instead. Worked out of the box. Just had to specify the DHCP range and give ut a LAN domain name.

Here is how to install the Broadcom 43xx drivers during Debian installation

[or at least

First

$ wget http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2

$ tar xvjpf broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2

$ cd broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5/driver/

$ b43-fwcutter -w . wl_apsta_mimo.o

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you will have a directory in that folder called ""b43"".  This will contain the firmware files the Debian installer needs to setup your 43xx as wlan0.

Copy this directory in full to a flash drive

Firstly I downloaded the netinst for squeeze. Burned that to a CD and ran it. It said that my network adapter required non-free hardware. After 30 minutes of searching I found a file containing all the .debs full on non-free firmware. 

I went ahead and put those debs in the root of my external HDD in the ""/firmware"" folder as instructed (I don't have a USB stick at the moment) and rebooted the install. I selected that I wanted to install the missing firmware. It went ahead with no complaint. However

The install got all the way to installing grub (which found my Win 7 install) and then inexplicably failed with no ability for me to see logs. I re-ran it with the same result. I then decided to install LILO just to get the thing going. It installed at that point and I booted the system. 

Instead of being greeted with a shell I could use to install the firmware I needed and move forward

I then discovered that there exists an unofficial non-free firmware netinst.iso I tried to download the torrent but it failed saying that ""the download isn't authorised for this tracker"". Downloading the iso from debian.org was going to take hours. It was progressing at a very slow rate. 

I needed to have my computer usable again and had to return to Ubuntu for now.

* run debian/knoppix  live from cd Failed - did not boot.  (uefi/bios)

And to make situation even worse my trusty cd-rom broke down as well. So now Im back to only using usb drives to boot live systems from (if needed)

Anyway

Install Apache2? Done. Works on SSL too. Took a week of reading and headaches just to understand it. Apache superior to IIS? Maybe

Install CVS? Done. Dunno what it does

Install ViewVC. Now i've installed it, but i don't know how the fsck to configure it, although i've pointed it at the CVSROOT directory i created earlier. All the readme's/how-to's i've found don't give you a simple walkthrough of *WHAT* to do and *HOW*. I presume this needs to be setup for use with Apache too, but he didn't specify. 

If i don't get it done by the end of the month

I'm seriously fucked off with this crap. Does ANYONE have a clue wtf is going on? :(

I'm not a programmer. I'm not a scripter. I'm the monkey on the other end of the phone when things go awry that notes down the problem

It's not that i don't want to LEARN Linux - i don't UNDERSTAND Linux. And how am i supposed to understand how it works, non-existant or written for people that already understand this crap?

On Windows, or values written to the windows registry. Linux - everything is scattered around, each distro puts things in different places, depending on the package management, config files aren't always in the program directories - IT MAKES NO SENSE! :'(
