Or is it? Without calling out names, bringing the total number up. 

At the same time, in the past 24 hours, we'e gotten five complaints from worried readers like yourself , one even going as far to say he was afraid we might be turning into /r/gamingnews or even /r/legitgamer. I assure you, this is not true.

Is LegitGamer banned from /r/gamernews? No. **But I do ask this**. If you see a post, **report it**. This goes for every site. I don't care if it's LegitGamer or if it's Joystiq or if it's the New York Times. From here on out, we will _not_ tolerate blogspam of any kind. It's in our rules, but we'e been sort of lax because of the difficulties in reading and verifying every link that's posted. No more. If the linked post adds nothing of value to the source material, report it. It will disappear. 

**What this means to our submitters**. When you go to post a link, we're trying to increase the value of the posts for our readers. As you know, if you do not follow the clearly stated rules, we will not hesitate to remove the post and provide feedback on how you could resubmit a better link.

We in the moderating team wanted to bring you this quick update.

**Pageview Milestone**

First off

Reddit recently made traffic reports available to everyone. You should be able to view our traffic reports here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/about/traffic/

**Rule Changes**

We recently discovered (With the excellent help of the admins) votegaming being employed in /r/gamernews. Votegaming is a method of using alt. accounts in a coordinated manner to upvote some submissions and downvote competing submissions. Most

The simplest way for us to address and police this votegaming abuse is a rule change: **From now on all video submissions must point to the official channels** (For example

In the rare cases where no official channel/source exists for videos (e.g. If a video was only sent out in a press release)

If you are a reader of /r/gamernews

If you submit to /r/gamernews, rather than uploading the copy sent to you in a press release or other communication.

We would also like to remind you that our rules don't allow embedding official video content on an unofficial web page and submitting that

I'd like to start by saying that ever since I started moderating here I've been blown away by how generally mature and collected this community is. I think /r/gamernews has kept to its original goal extremely well

We're quickly approaching 50, and we moderators thought we'd take this opportunity to make this general call for any opinions, questions or concerns you might have about the community.

If you'd like to see something changed

**Please note that any criticisms should be constructive**. If you have a problem but don't have a practical alternative/solution

This is also a great opportunity to ask for clarity on the rules. We often see confusion about how things operate here

With E3 coming up we wanted to remind everyone of our rules as well as announce a few minor changes. Don't worry
___
**Rumors**


&gt;If the material posted is a rumor, informative, and quantitative.


Previously this was under the header of another section. This has now been moved to it's own bolded section in order to highlight it a little better.

If your post is unconfirmed and does not have rumour in the title - it will be removed. Please make our job easier by getting this one right.

___




**Reposts**

These aren't strictly forbidden and we have no intention of forbidding them. The first post made isn't necessarily the best post on a subject. One example might be a terrible blog post reporting on some news submitting here first while a major news site with much more detail and juicyness is made second. In this example the second submission deserves to be upvoted far more than the first. For this reason reposts won't be outlawed.

We do however ask that people check the new queue before posting, but we hope you can all cut things down a little bit by remembering this.

Additionally

___

We've also moved the rule list to the wiki for easier editing, we'd just like everyone to be aware of it and to help us help you keep this sub from going to the dogs when the posts start pouring in.

I'm sure as a lot of you know that our subreddit is growing at a rapid rate, it's difficult to always find the most up to date information out there in the gaming world. So my challenge to you /r/gamernews is to at least a few times throughout the day click the new tab and browse a few of the new articles to give them a chance to make the front page, and hopefully provide a little more diversity in terms of submissions. I know that several of you already do this and I thank you wholeheartedly, but I feel like if everyone participates in this we should see a huge jump in the amount of interesting articles that make it to the front page, and this will help promote an active subreddit. 

You guys are all awesome

-The moderating crew.

* **Edit** - I have also enabled editing your flair in this subreddit if you choose to.
