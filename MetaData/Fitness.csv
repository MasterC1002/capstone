At the end of gangster paradise hes standing right in front of me on a speaker. As the music faded he then slammed a quarter of a patron bottle and put his rings in his pocket.  The whole time I'm watching this thinking wtf is he gonna do?  Next thing I see is his body flying towards me.  I caught him on my right shoulder with each thigh in hand.  The momentum of him falling pushed me down into the position I am at when I am at the bottom of a squat rep.  Being drunk I am surprised we didn't just tip over but somehow my balance was stable.  I then finished the squat rep of Coolio and vaulted him behind me to the rest of the crowd and he crowd surfed away.  I then yelled ""this is what I have been training for"" and went and got a beer.

-------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to share with you guys where fitness has brought me over the last half year or so. I know a lot of girls are scared of heavy lifting, but part of my life. 

I started getting into fitness the summer of 2012. I started off with typical 'girl' things like yoga, reading r/fitness and decided to try out strength training. 

When I first put a barbell on my back to try to squat, then I started realizing that every time I went back, the weight that felt like the world last week, now felt manageable. I did some bastardized once a week version of 'starting stregnth', but I was still getting results. By the end of the summer I had dropped the excess weight that I had and decided to stop losing and start eating to gain muscle. Eventually I got more and more comfortable and started lifting twice a week, then three times. 

By about november of 2012

----------------------------------------------------

My lifts went from: 

Squat: 65lbs - &gt; 185lbs 

Bench: 45lbs - &gt; 120lbs 

Deadlift: 65lbs - &gt; 225lbs 


My bodyweight went from 115 -&gt; 98lbs (my lowest) -&gt; 110lbs (now). 

I've been 5'2 this whole time. Wish that went up

--------------------------------------------------
Diet:

I forgot to add this in because I don't really follow much of one. I eat until I'm full and just get enough protein. The best thing I've learned in terms of diet is portion sizes and how to estimate calories. 

It comes out to about 1500 cals rest day
When I was first losing weight

Supplementation: 

I swig fish oil. And use some whey. I'm not a huge fan of stims

--------------------------------------------------
I've joined an olympic lifting team this month now following bulgarian methods and have switched my focus over from powerlifting

**Please ladies, neither is squatting 5x a week.

If I could tell you one thing

Don't overcomplicate things. Don't try to get everything perfect before you get in the gym. Just lift. And then lift a little more. It's simple

Here's me at 210lb's in Oct 2008.  http://imgur.com/U9ej2
Overall  I was in pretty bad health.  Big drinker/smoker
Here's me at 152lb's after finishing IRONMAN Arizona http://imgur.com/oo3Bn

The last 4 years were in no way linear and Ironman was never the goal (until last year).  This was my progress...

* Jan 2009 Weight loss competition.  Diet: Modified 4hr body.  Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work.  I was working out in a clubhouse gym

* June 2009 Join a 24hr gym.  More resistance training

* Feb 2010 First 5k.  33min
* March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness.  Start Spinning 2-3 times/week.  Lifting 6 days week.
* Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon  2:0X:XX
* May 2011  Find Fittit.  Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me. 
* Nov 2011  Sign up for IMAZ 2012.  Stop drinking during the week. 
* Dec 2011  Bought road bike 
* Feb 2012  First Marathon  3:5X:XX
* April 2012  First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman  5:3X:XX
* Nov 2012  Ironman Arizona 11:1X:XX

* Advice (for what it's worth)
* Find a diet with food you like.  I still eat chicken
* Start doing the big compound lifts
* Interval training works
* You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet.  I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.  
* Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.  

A sincere thanks to you Fittit.  Couldn't have done it without you.

Before we get into the transformation I want to give this message to all those in the transformation process. Transforming yourself on the inside is as important if not more so than making the physical transformation. I'll get into this again later, and life in general that my life REALLY change.** 

You can be the biggest/most ripped guy on the planet

**My Transformation**

* I grew up as a skinny little kid. Didn't pass 100lbs until I was 15. Took weight lifting in High School but wasn't very serious about it. Put on a decent amount of muscle for a High Schooler but I was still skinny as hell. [Here's me at 18 in 2005

* Went to college and made getting big my NUMBER one goal. Didn't party, unconfident, and felt that if I could get big then I could get girls.) Put on about 20lbs that year, bench went from 205 to 255, didn't do a single squat that year hah. [Here's me at 175lbs in the Summer of 2006](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#1)

* From the fall of 2006 to the end of 2008 I took bulking VERY seriously

* I started my cut in the Winter of 2008 and that lasted all the way until the fall of 2009. I tried EVERY diet. 40/40/20, carb cycling, keto, high fat, low fat, high carb, low carb. You name it, lost quite a bit of strength

* Today I am a healthy 195. I've been at this weight for the last two years. This seems to be a good homeostasis point. I like the weight because I can be strong/big and yet still pretty athletic(I'm in the Army so I need to be able to run). [A shot of my legs in Sept 2012.](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#6) [Just for fun

* [A video I made of my transformation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRDBtgdhoM)

* [Link to a more detailed write-up of my transformation](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/02/12/the-transformation-of-a-nerdy-asian-gamer/)

Now let me talk about inner change. After I got ""ripped"" in 2009 I realized that life didn't change much. Sure I got more attention from people and girls, and that's why I keep hitting on that issue.**

That's when I really got serious with self development. Read a ton of books and worked on my inner being. A few examples of exercises I did- I would walk around and force myself to hold eye-contact with every person walking by me on campus(insanely difficult at first!). I consciously talked louder. I made myself aware of how my body language was at all times. Little things like that

Today I absolutely love life. I love it and I live it with zeal. I've been able to land great jobs because of my confidence and social skills developed over the last few years. I've started my own business that brings in about 1k a month after 8 months. I was able to do this because of the confidence I gained and the realization that anything is possible with disciplined hard work.

**So my message to all of you is that you can change EVERYTHING about yourself. You can change your appearance

And just to put a little plug in, and confident(because I grew up addicted to UO/EQ/WoW).

* [If you're into the whole facebook thing would love to get more like-minded folks active on the facebook page to share ideas/get new ideas/motivate each other.](https://www.facebook.com/thehealthygamerchannel)

My passion in life is helping others realize the potential hidden within them. We all have within us the seed of greatness. It is up to you to awaken and nurture that seed until it propels you into the life that you've always known you deserved. Go out there. Take action. Make it happen.

Feel free to ask me questions about training/fitness/nutrition/self development/confidence/women/motivation. I'm going to check this thread pretty regularly for the next week and answer all of them. And again guys

**FAQ**

* What exercise regime did I follow? - I followed Madcow 5x5 for most of the period. I now do 5x3x1. I modify both of these by adding in extra sets of hypertrophy specific work at the end of the workout(3-5 sets of an exercise that compliments the major muscle groups worked that day with 10-15 reps). 

* What kind of diet do you recommend? - I have tried literally everything. Keto, high carb, low carb, whole grain, no grain, 2g protein/lb, etc. From all of that I firmly believe that in order to have optimal body composition and optimal health we MUST eliminate or greatly reduce our consumption of processed carbohydrates. I follow a primal/paleo lifestyle now. I eat eggs, fruits, flours

* To expand on the diet - I think Keto is very effective for losing fat

* [The best book I've ever read on the subject of nutrition that's written in an accessible and easy to read fashion is Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint](http://www.amazon.com/The-Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless/dp/0982207786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361403480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=primal+blueprint)

* The best way to gain weight IMO is to increase your sources of healthy fats and eat nutritious carbohydrates. Healthy fats: avocados, almonds, almond butter to name a few. Nutritious carbohydrates: sweet potatoes, fruits, veggies, plantanes, yucca roots.

* What kind of cardio did I do? I did a lot of steady state stuff. BUT today I do mostly high intensity interval cardio and circuit cardio. Examples of interval cardio: sprint for 60 seconds, 25 bodyweight squats, 6 pullups, 25 crunches, back to back with 30s rest before you do it again. Repeat 5-6x. This type of cardio imo is MUCH more efficient and actually better at helping you arrive at your fat loss/muscle building gains than doing steady state cardio(running/elliptical for half an hour or more.) - There is a study that showed participants who did 8 minutes of interval cardio where they exercised for 60s, rested for 30s, burned MORE calories than participants who did steady state cardio(hr of 150) for half an hour.

* How do you incorporate running with weight lifting? - I run two times a week

* What self-development books do I recommend? - ALL OF THEM. Megaliving and The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma are both really good. Tony Robbins has a bunch of good books

* I also HIGHLY recommend audio books. To date Earl Nightengale's ""The Strangest Secret"" is still the most motivational thing I've ever heard, and random housework where you don't have to really focus the average person can squeeze in 3+ hours of audio books a day. That adds up to a tremendous amount of knowledge gained over a period of years.

* **MEDITATION** Meditation is the ONE practice that lead me to be able to make every other inner change I've ever made. Without meditation I would not be the person I am. The real power in meditation is its ability to: center you, that no matter what happens you will be okay, and that life is wonderful. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in improving themselves to pick up the practice of meditating for at least 5 minutes each day. I meditate for 5 minutes in the morning, 20 min in the afternoon, and an additional 10 mins before I go to bed. It is very simple. I just focus on my breathing and bring my attention to the present. That's all you have to do.

* PHEW alright I think that covered most of the questions

I've been going to the same gym for 6 months now. I've seen the same guy there pretty much every time I work out (6am)
  
Today was different though. I saw him today, completely blank face.  
  
We were out of the lockers and started warming up for deadlifts. Now, and he loads two 25's on each side, 50lbs is huge to add to such an intense workout. He busts out 15 reps with such unreal intensity, by the 10th rep he had an insane pump going, and thats when the tears started breaking out and streaming down his face. He's grunting/yelling/making sounds (not too loud to disrupt the maybe...3 people in the gym at the time?) by the 10th rep. After the 15th he could barely get the bar up. When he was done he was a complete wreck. Very close to fainting, tears fully on streaming down his face. Red as a tomato, total rage, he replied in such a shaky/sobby voice: ""She took my kids

**Edit**: phone dying. Will answer more in a couple hours.  

**Edit 2**: Copied from a post I made earlier in the thread

she pointed out that because the primary goal was competition, and it was done using the ""Clean Eating"" diet (zero preservatives), weight training (2-3x per week @ 1.5 hours/session), and consistent slow burn cardios (2-3x per week @ 1.5 hours/session). Weight went from roughly 170 down to 125 (now at 114).
I mentioned 'silly diet and workout' as in more recent weeks, and 36 egg whites + 12 whole eggs on another day. Workout has also gotten ridiculous where she will spend 4 hours at the gym doing 1 hour cardio, 2 hours depletion (450 biceps, 450 triceps), then another hour of cardio.

**Edit 3**: Major thanks goes out to all the mods who have been removing garbage from this thread.

**Edit 4**: My SO suggested I point out that a few months ago she did 3 spin classes back to back to test her endurance. Notbad.jpg

**Edit 5**: I was wrong about the 900 per muscle

**Edit 6**: She's super happy about the positive response this got. Wasn't expecting anything really (I just said ""hey,,False,,t5_2qhx4,1362585847.0,,True

5. Intelligent discussion

***** Final comment from me: Guys don't want to be skinny. Being called weak and skinny is not a subtle compliment. She said I was too weak and skinny to be of any use on the company soccer team. This wasn't some jealous girl shyly wishing she was skinny like me. She called me weak and useless. That's a pretty clear insult. Girls may want to be skinny, guys want to be strong. Calling a guy skinny and weak is attack on his masculinity. It was very clear that's the message she was trying to convey when she called me ""too skinny"". Since she attacked my physical ""usefulness"" to the soccer team, I attacked hers (she's on the team). That was the context of the banter.

I went to the gym today and as I entered my weight into the elliptical (322lbs) I heard the girl next to me turn to her friend and say ""this girl is 300 pounds, legs, and stomach."" She didn't say anything back and I just went ahead with my work out.

I can not thank this community enough. I have subscribed to various subreddits since March when I started the gym and I have since lost 25lbs. I started at a whopping 389lbs in November of 2011. I dropped down to 347lbs by March 2012 by completely quitting all fast food and soda (I was addicted to both - you don't get to my size without being so). In March 2012 I started going to the gym six days a week. I started at 347lbs and today I weigh 322lbs. I tried Keto for about a month but it just did not work for me. I eat a balanced diet and keep my calorie count under 1000 calories a day. I own a FitBit and my average calorie burn (because I am so heavy) during my 60 minutes of cardio is 1400 calories. 

It is A LOT of hard work and I deserve every painstaking minute on the equipment, I read every day and find a new reason every day why I should keep going forward. Thank you all so very much. You inspire me every single day!

I am overwhelmed with the support and encouragement I have received from you all. This has made my entire week. I can not tell you how thankful I am to have you all share your inspiring stories each and every day. It makes this process so much more enjoyable for me, but I promise I will. It means so much to me that you took the time to share your thoughts with me, so I want to personally acknowledge that. I truly appreciate everything that was said. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Haha you're fat as fuck. Like seriously you can keep working out but you won't be attractive, and long as I'm confident people like you are assholes"". But the truth is that any normal person looks at you with pity and disgust, hoping they never become as disgustingly overweight. I would probably kill myself if I even weighed over 250. 322 pounds is what a wild animal should weigh, not a fucking human being hahaha. Don't you have any self respect? Anyone who lets themselves become that fat deserves to be that fat. ""Oh its genetics"", ""I'm big boned""... fuck you. This is all because of your life decisions. It's not hard to get skinny, it's just hard not to eat the last slice of pie right?

Here's my favorite:

I was at the gym in my university and I saw a pack of underclassmen doing bicep curls. One of the pack members broke off from the group and said, I have a date tonight."" This stopped the pack bros short. ""A date?"" they asked. ""Yeah dude, bitches can smell squat on you. It's the squats bro, they can smell it. I have to squat today."" The pack cracked up, imagining that this was a great joke, and a really novel way to get them to do legs. His face remained impassive: He was dead serious. He truly believed that bitches could smell squat on a man. After discussing his theory for roughly 5 minutes near me where I was doing decline bench, the lone wolf finally persuaded the rest of the pack and they all went to go do squats.

1339371933.0,uva9t,Big Reddit Protein Powder Measurement Results,physicistjedi,2939,890,484,"I promised [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/te1rk/offering_broscience_service_ill_test_your_protein/) to measure the protein content of various supplement powders. Many people offered to send samples and I selected some. Yesterday and today after couple hours of work I finished the measurements. 

**[Here are the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag9uT-E4EIL7dFZPZnR0WVZybGtFWnRKNzdKNm9XOVE#gid=0)**

My interpretation: I haven't measured any powder as 100% accurate. The reason probably is that none of it dissolved in water as good as my BSA standard. I gave a subjective solubility score to each. For example many chocolate flavored powders left a debris that looks like cacao

Brandwise, **stay away from American Pure Whey**.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the bitcoin donations. I'll turn them into caffeine

**EDIT:** For those of you who are curious here is the [photo of the plate](http://imgur.com/QvDLy

**EDIT:** As pointed out by the submitter MyProtein has a fine print that says cocoa in chocolate flavored protein makes the actual protein content %8 less than the unflavored one. We measured the chocolate version so I adjusted the claimed protein per serving from 19.6g to 18g. This pushed the reading to 90%.

**EDIT:** No

**EDIT:** There has been very valuable suggestions in the comments by people who are more experienced than me in the lab. If anyone wants to do something similar in the future here are some thing we have learned:

* Sonicate your samples

* Try to find a research grade whey/casein standard from a reputable brand

* Seek for alternative assays (total nitrogen

* If you are going to add detergent (which I didn't)

* **Exercise**: I did *some* exercise every single day. I missed a few days obviously with injuries and getting run down after a while, and when you're as out of shape as I was you actually need the cardiovascular benefits. I did everything: walking, jogging, sprint intervals, elliptical, biking, swimming, I just did something every day for at least a half hour. I did a ton of sports too since I've always enjoyed pretty much all sports. Don't worry, but I still feel stronger and my lifts went up some. My squat went from 135 to 255 (these are all 3x5 working set numbers btw), and I switched my bench from barbell to dumbell about half way through and currently bench 60 Lb dumbells.

About 2 years ago I restarted my weight loss journey after regaining about 130lbs after losing over 180lbs at age 20 and getting a panniculectomy.  When I lost the weight originally it was through atkins and tons of cardio

Since then all my blood lipid levels are now within healthy range and I have been able to drop three out of four of my asthma medications not to mention the relief of debilitating depression and lack of self esteem. I posted a while back about winning a weight loss competition  http://bit.ly/XOpxhu and you told me to post on my continued progress well I am back to do just that. 

My diet has been aided by the use of myfitnesspal and macronutrient counting. Learning how much my body needs instead of eating whatever I wanted has been a struggle but I am getting better at it all the time. I eat oats in the morning most days. Salmon or chicken is my primary protein source with the occasional whey shake. I also have a cheat meal once a week to keep me sane. Lately I have been eating at a caloric surplus in order to attempt to fill out some of the loose skin with muscle and become more aesthetic. 

I have continued to weight train using a traditional bodybuilding split focusing on compound movements at low reps to start each workout and I run. 

Lifts currently Squat 5 x 275 Bench 5 x 205 Military Press 5 x 115 Deadlift 5 x 315

I also have been practicing traditional Mysore style Ashtanga yoga 6 days a week. Yoga is my main focus lately because the benefits seem to transcend the physical. I practice 6 days a week (except for the new/full moons) in the early morning and I go to a teacher about 90 minutes away from my home in order to learn the practice from a qualified professional. I am only able to afford to do this about once a month. I am currently in a haiku contest to try to win a $200 gift certificate to my favorite yoga studio Moksha Yoga in Chicago if you could throw me a vote it would help me immensely to be able to continue my education in the practice. Link to my submission here  http://bit.ly/12i6uvD 

Thank you so much for all you in the community have done for me through your inspiration and quality information you spread here daily. I have relied on this place for so much in my journey so far and will definitely continue to do so. My goals for the future are to continue to challenge myself physically and to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of my life.

--------------------------------------------------------------
**The full story:** I have never been a fit person.  In high school, I was wearing double knee braces and popping tons of pain pills just to be able to walk.  Eventually, I diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, with Sjogren’s disease as a likely secondary.  In college, I slowly started to get better.  I pulled myself off almost all of my meds because of side effects, and the worst symptoms faded as I got older, although I still had issues with the arthritis in my knees and chronic nausea.  

In my sophomore year of college, I fell into the typical cardio-bunny cycle: binge eating followed by guilt-driven exercise.  I mainly did the elliptical and weight machines, but never really made any progress.   

In May of last year, and was promptly ordered to squat.  I started browsing r/fitness religiously and read Starting Strength.  I went into the weightroom for the first time terrified.  I got to the squat rack and almost left.  But I stayed, and it turned out – I really fucking loved weightlifting.  I started going 6 days a week. Within a month, the pain and swelling in my knees had disappeared.  I started tracking my foods, eating more, and my chronic nausea got better.

In September, and was informed that it was due to my eating habits.  I had been a vegetarian for 7 years, but powerlifting converted me.  I switched to Texas Method in March and started bulking with ALL the meats (and by all, I mean bacon). 

Now I’m working with a trainer learning Olympic lifting, play on my company’s softball team, and go to a weekly bootcamp class. I even ran my first race 2 weeks ago.  Fitocracy has been a huge motivating factor along the way, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is getting into lifting.  My numbers aren’t as strong as I would like them to be, but it’s been a hell of a year with school on top of working full time.  And overall, I am very happy with my progress.

[My Year Of Hard Work In Photos](http://i.imgur.com/A1xLY.jpg)

Hello All!

I believe it was around the 9th month mark or so I had posted here and promised to update again; January 7th marks my official '1 Year of Training' progress. Hopefully this helps to motivate people who were in my spot last year - tired all the time, I feel ashamed I'd let myself go so much; I don't ever intend to return to that lifestyle again.

Some quick infos:

- The scar is from pyloric stenosis

- I am a photographer full time

- Initially Jan through March I was pretty strictly 'cardio only'; April, barbells, etc. and began to focus on that as my main means of exercise during my cut. I would highly advise anyone who was in a similar spot body-wise to **lift as heavy a weight as you can during your cut!** . I am quite sure that a strong core allowed me to avoid stretch marks and the 'skinnyfat' look of someone who lost weight but still looks..'sloppy'. 

- My diet was pretty straight-forward; at least -500 calories a day from my estimated maintenance (though often more then that) based on a protein-rich selection of foods. 

Anyways

**edit** I'm 6'1""


**edit2**

Unimpressive lifts at present:

Bench went from 165 1RM to 240 1RM; squat when I started I thought was 230, have it written down in the gym). Deadlift I didn't track when I started, but is up to 355lbs 1RM now.

Before I begin


**MY STORY:**

Embarrassingly

Halfway through my spin, right in half.

My punishment was 3 months in a cast and crutches. My activity declined to 0, I became incredibly addicted to video games. Since sports were no longer an option, video games filled the competitive void that was missing.

On a real note
- this was one of the darkest moments of my life. I hadn’t experienced isolation like this before

3 months later I was a competitive and feared gamer (n00bs), which I came to realize I was no longer Batman in Gotham City. I was his arch nemesis the Penguin, relatively speaking.

Over the next 2 years, how I carried myself, and what I believed was achievable. A lot of trial and error was involved, and there are certainly things I would have changed, but this is how I got there.

 

**MY WORKOUT:**

I never worked out on the weekends, bros want to hang out, girlfriend wants to go for a spa day, etc. I worked an 8-hour shift, Monday through Friday, and treat my workouts as an extension of my workday.

I cycled my workouts every 6-8 weeks, roughly 2 weeks in-between each cycle.

Your body responds differently to certain types of training just as it does to particular foods, frequency, volume, and training type that work best for you.

I always rotated between a strength cycle (4-6 reps) and hypertrophy cycle (8-12 reps).

I experimented with many training modalities ranging from 2-day full body splits to 6-day splits that hit every muscle group twice per week. I also tried separate resting protocols

I’m an 20/80 guy



**KEYS TO MY WORKOUT SUCCESS:**

* Correct compensated movement patterns.

    People joke about Quasimodo but I’ve seen a few of these mythical creatures lurking in the gym, compensated movement patterns, and ultimately injury.

* Train in proper postural alignment.

    Ensure that with each movement, the anterior deltoid is shortened, and you’re developing the muscle fibers in this position. Again, avoid the Quasimodo.

* Make a mind-body connection with your muscles.

    This sounds like a total hoax but I kid you not. You have to make a mind-body connection with your muscles, contracting the musculature involved (primarily the lats), and imagining the muscles being worked throughout each inch of the lift. Help your body connect the dots on every rep.  

* Don’t bullshit your workout

    You need to take your workout seriously. When you’re at the gym, or mingle with others for minutes on end. You need to make the mind-body connection with your muscles, make sure you are in proper postural alignment with every rep, ensure your form is nothing short of perfection, and strictly adhere to your rest times. That’s a lot of shit, and you need to be on top of it.

 

**MY AB WORKOUT:**

Let me make clear that abs are made in the kitchen, 3 grapes, and a carrot stick and leave the house with a shredded 6 pack.

My abdominal workout consisted of 4 ab workouts per week, I did so by increasing the resistance or difficulty.

Here is an example ab routine from one of my 5-day splits:


* Monday (exercises superset

    Weighted Sit-ups: 25lbs @ 20 reps

    Hanging Knee Raises: 15 reps @ 2-0-2-0 tempo

    60 sec rest

* Tuesday (exercises superset

    Plank: 1 minute

    Weighted Cycling Russian Twist: 25 lbs @ 15 reps/side

    60 sec rest

* Thursday (exercises superset

    Barbell Floor Sweeper: 185 lbs @ 12 reps

    Weighted Toe Crunch: 25 lbs @ 20 reps

    60 sec rest

* Friday (exercises superset

    Decline Reverse Crunch: 12 reps @ 2-0-2-0 tempo

    Side Plank: 1 minute (both sides)

    60 sec rest


[Here's a copy of the ab workout](http://thryv.com/workout/plans/467)

You’ll notice that I did no more than 4 sets of abdominal work for each ab day

The exercises above were selected because you can progressively overload them by increasing the resistance for ab exercises that utilized weight, Hanging Knee Raises --&gt; Hanging Leg Raises]



**MY DIET &amp; SUPPLEMENTS:**

I didn’t count a single calorie. While I did attempt to (a short-lived 2 days)

What I did count was the single handedly most important macro

Other than counting protein, and a dash of bacon. 

Before long, lunch, and dinner (for the most part) at every meal. Food was there to serve the purpose of giving my body the energy and nutrients it needed to continue growing.

I didn’t know what “Paleo” was at the time I was going through my transformation

**Supplements**
My goal was (and still is) to stay completely natural

    Pre-Workout: NO-Xplode (cycled)
    Post-Workout: Whey Protein
    Night-Time: Casein Protein
    Fat Burn Stack: Green Tea Extract

Pertaining to the Fat Burn Stack, although there are a number of people who live by it.

But on a side note



**KEY THINGS THAT KEPT ME HEALTHY DURING MY TRAINING:**

* Dynamic Warm-ups

    You need to prepare your muscles for the movements and stresses they are about to endure. Working on chest? Do some Rolling T-Pushups to work the concentric/eccentric movements of the chest/triceps and stabilization of the shoulders. Leg day? Get in some lunge + rotation’s to warm-up the lower body musculature / core or perform a few alternating groiners.

* Adequate Rest

    I can’t stress this enough. Not just rest between workouts, 15+), and training modality (MRT).  It’s completely natural to be itching to workout on your off days but stay disciplined. Exercise induces micro tears and inadequate rest is the quickest 1-way ticket to overtraining.

* Foam Rolling

    Also known as SMR (Self Myofascial Release). I attribute much of my recovery speed to foam rolling. It provides a good deep tissue massage and increases blood flow to the muscle



**MORALE OF THE STORY:**

Getting to 5% was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done

You always hear the cliché “fitness isn’t temporary

My advice?

Experiment with different training modalities and focus on outcomes. Quantify your results and understand your body. Then keep your diet and workout SPE; Sustainable

It’s great to have your fitness idols and strive to mimic their physique but you have to be patient, need to overcome mental barriers, and occasionally frequent the ideas of calling it quits but remember everyone started from the bottom, even Arnold.

* [This is what I looked like on my birthday last year.](http://foodisforfuel.com/wp-content/gallery/progress/424-11-03-10.jpg)

The reason I kept going is because when I looked in the mirror, I see what I'm going to be in 6 months. In 6 months, I'll see what I'm going to be in a year.

I was able to lose so much weight because I never thought about how flawed I was. I only thought about how I could become who I wanted to be and when that was the only thought flooding my mind

Now I'm using [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 weight training system](http://www.amazon.com/Simplest-Effective-Training-Increase-Strength/dp/0557248299/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320247531&amp;sr=8-1)

Yesterday

I can do that now because I didn't kill myself in a gym or on a treadmill a year ago. I didn't tempt myself to quit so I could push through it and become a ""better person"" for it. I didn't get a personal trainer's raging spittle all over my grill. I paced myself and my fitness evolved with my body. You don't have to render yourself breathless to be able to truly appreciate the air you breathe. You just have to keep breathing.

* [Here's a video of my fitness evolution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBBU-Cuosfg&amp;feature=channel_video_title) I did my first dips with good depth last week.

So happy birthday to me. Next year, or the next month, or the next year. And next year, I'll be focusing on who I'll be the year after that.

I'm half the man I used to be but I'm nowhere near the man I'm going to be.

&gt;Brothers, considering I did 8 independent ones for four separate APW flavors) or there is far less protein in their powder than they claim.

&gt;Here, the more protein there is. I tested blanks (buffer only, no protein), analytical-grade bovine serum albumin at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL, 1.0, strawberry, and 2.0 mg/mL. Now

&gt;tl;dr - darker = more protein

&gt;* [HARK

&gt;Note: the first three wells in the ""Blanks/APW"" row - under the BSA wells - are blanks

&gt;And yes

&gt;The other assay type I ran is a standard method for protein determination: measure how much 280-nm UV light it absorbs. I tested blanks and each protein powder at 1 mg/mL, and all were at the same nominal concentration. I'm working within the dynamic range of the instrument, so absorbance correlates linearly to the amount of protein, meaning that 5x the absorbance means 5x as much protein.

&gt;I'm going to repeat the A280 assay tomorrow because it's quick, but fuuuuuck. The only other explanation besides ""piece of shit product"" is that the bits of APW powder I grabbed were the non-protein bits, which could mean that their powder is horribly mixed - either that, or I'm a goddamned wizard of entropy, because what are the odds of me grabbing 50 milligrams of filler from four separate samples?

First of all, you got this. 

**MY STORY**


It started with a girl, but mostly because I knew she was right. I had spent my first 3 years of college being the lazy kid, and more importantly, I had lost track of myself. My humor was rude, my diet was atrocious, and my motivation was at all all time low. I broke my ankle and leg in the middle of my sophmore year and during my weeks stuck on the couch, I became addicted to playing league of legends

These last 3 years were extremely difficult for me - my negative feelings consumed me

What started out as something I did for her has transformed into a passion that has taught me infinitely more than how to pick up and put down heavy things. I will touch on what I've learned later in the post


**DIET**

*Note: I am lactose intolerant*


It all started with paying a little bit of attention to my intake. I dropped junk food for the most part and was more concious of the overall quality of food - aka


When I got home from school for the summer

**[Here is a photo of me at my thinnest \(~185-190 ---&gt; ~175\).](http://i.imgur.com/hZmCspH.jpg) This was 1 months difference.**

*The cut*


- I ate 1600-1800 calories a day
- I lifted intensely for ~1.5 hours and followed that with 25 minutes of interval training
- This cut lasted ~3-4 weeks. 


On my cut my meals looked like this:


- Breakfast: *omelette
- Lunch: *grilled chicken
- Dinner: *grilled chicken or burger, whole wheat pasta or brown rice*


At the end of my cut, but something started to seem off. Based on a lot of browsing this sub, I knew I had to up my intake to gain muscle - I also didn't have much more fat to lose. I started aiming for 2200 a day, as I was having trouble getting myself to eat more. Now, I am trying to get up to ~2700 a day to break even or to 3000 for a slow bulk, but I'm having trouble getting myself to eat more.  I think it is largely mental - a fear of moving backwards and gaining fat again.

*Current Eating*: pretty much the same food as the cut

**I aim for 200g of protein a day - achieved through eggs, and whey shakes**

*I also aim for a certain number of carbs (300-400g) and fats (60g) on a training day* but am not as strict about this.  I used [this site](http://sareyko.net/leancalc/#/g=male/a=NaN/w=NaN/h=NaN/b=NaN/m=1.2/r=-20/t=20/p=2.5/e=NaN) to calculate all of this.

- I eat ~2500-2700 a day
- Breakfast: *2 eggs
- Lunch: *turkey
- Dinner: *chicken or beef, salad, 2 scoops whey (Isopure)*
- Snacks: *fruit
- Alcohol: *I've had about 3 beers since I started to take my diet seriously*

**LIFTS**

I haven't really kept track of my 1RM

6/28 - **Bench** - 185 x 5; current 1RM: ~210

7/30 - **Bench** - current 1RM: 225



**ROUTINE**

*Note: I have a permanent back injury (disc degeneration at my L5 S1) preventing me from doing heavy squats and deadlifts. Because of this

I've always done a variation of a 3 day split.  I lift for nearly 2 hours 6 days a week

- **My current 3 day split:** chest/tri, as I dont want to lose. 

- [Here is a screenshot showing the exercises I do](http://i.imgur.com/t8PzSDy.png)
- Super sets have been a staple of my workout since I started


**MENTALITY**

I've come to learn that lifting is as much a mental battle as it is a physical one.  Luckily

Since I've stopped caring about her, but my focus faded slightly and the intensity did as well.  

Things that have helped me stay motivated since then

- Fast Paced Rap ([here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Wyy2Y0G.png))
- [Kai Greene Training Videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1B_r9nC9k)
- Focusing on working my muscles efficiently rather than the amount of weight I am working with.
- Thinking of the insane progress posts I see on this sub every day.

You may think you are giving it your all


**WHAT I'VE LEARNED**

I could write forever about what this process has taught me

Like it starts for many

When I look in the mirror at the gym during a workout or after when I get home

I've learned:

- Whining about your problems will accomplish nothing.  It is up to you to fix yourself. 
- It is easier to stop thinking about how hard it will be and just do it.  It is far harder to live unhappily than it is to do the things necessary to be happy.  And the things you do may very well last your life time.
- What it means to truly dedicate myself to something and that I **CAN** do this
- What it means to push myself to my limit
- That getting in better shape is directly correlated to confidence and # of girls who smile at you



**THANKS**

Once again, or encourage others to continue on their journeys.  Everyone who has dedicated themselves to fitness can acknowledge that it is not an easy process, and all of your words and encouragement make it that much easier for me to stay motivated every day.  

**If you have any questions or advice for me regarding my diet or routine I'd love to hear it.**  There are millions of people on here that know more than me

[Before/After Shots](http://imgur.com/a/DbFp5)

[Added Leg Shot](http://imgur.com/hFNVJs1)

-------------------
**Background:**

I've made some mistakes in my past that I deeply regret and am doing everything to move on from.  Without going into too much detail, yogi, jiu jitsu competitor, powerlifter, and all around athlete.  I made a commitment to myself before going in that I would do everything in my power to continue improving myself mentally, physically, and spiritually while inside, meditate, and write.  I could write another entire post about yoga

**Update:**  I've been in the gym for about a week, OHP 195 -&gt; 185, and did not test bench.  I've very pleased with these numbers, as I've been able to maintain significant strength.  Also considering I've lost about 20 lbs, I'm pound for pound as strong, if not stronger than before.


**Training:**

Pre-Prison:

Prior to heading in, 525 deadlift, 315 bench, 195 overhead press.  My split generally looked like this:

Monday: Squat
Tuesday: Bench
Wednesday: Hill Sprint Workout OR some type of Crossfit Metcon workout
Thursday: Jiu Jitsu Training OR Rest
Friday: Overhead Press
Saturday: Deadlift
Sunday: Active recovery -- Bikram yoga

Prison:
I only had access to a pullup bar, and ab wheel, so all of my workouts were bodyweight.  I have read Convict conditioning and did a lot of research into good bodyweight workouts before going in.  In addition to the workouts, I got up at 5am everyday to do 1 hour of yoga next to my bunk, 20 minutes of tai chi, 20 minutes of pranayama breathing exercises, and 30 minutes of meditation.  I would make an effort to walk for at least an hour per day (we were in a dorm setup with a common area which I would pace around the perimter)

My workouts generally looked like this:

Day 1 - Upper Body

Pullups - 10 sets of 10 reps (increased over time to 14-15 reps)
Handstand Pushups - 6 sets of 6 reps (increased over time to 10-12 reps)
Pushups - initially 10 sets of 25 reps
Bodyweight Row (used dip station
Dips - 6 sets of 15 reps

Day 2 - Lower Body + 5x40 Burpees (burpees done in a separate workout -- usually first thing in the morning then the lower body workout done later in the day)

10 rounds as fast as possible: 25 jump squats
It took a while to work up to this workout.  My goal heading in was to get good at pistols
8 sets of 30 squats

Day 3 - Abs / Lower Back + 5x40 Burpees (burpees done first thing in AM
10 sets of 12 reps hanging leg raise
10 sets of 20 reps back extension (had access to simple back extension setup when moved to state prison)
6 sets of 40 situps
6 sets of 12 back bridges (Convict conditioning style...full bridge from ground)
4 sets of 20 ab wheel rollouts (had access to ab wheel in state prison gym)
4 sets of 2 reps 'wall walks' -- stand in front of a wall and arch backwards

Day 4 - Upper Body
Pullups - 10 sets of 10 reps (increased over time to 14-15 reps)
Handstand Pushups - 6 sets of 6 reps (increased over time to 10-12 reps)
Pushups - initially 10 sets of 25 reps
Bodyweight Row (used dip station
Dips - 6 sets of 15 reps

Day 5 - Lower Body + 5x40 Burpees

10 rounds as fast as possible: 25 jump squats
It took a while to work up to this workout.  My goal heading in was to get good at pistols
8 sets of 30 squats

Day 6 - Abs /Lower Back + 5x40 Burpees
10 sets of 12 reps hanging leg raise
10 sets of 20 reps back extension (had access to simple back extension setup when moved to state prison)
6 sets of 40 situps
6 sets of 12 back bridges (Convict conditioning style...full bridge from ground)
4 sets of 20 ab wheel rollouts (had access to ab wheel in state prison gym)
4 sets of 2 reps 'wall walks' -- stand in front of a wall and arch backwards

Day 7 - Rest

Nutrition:

This was my biggest concern going in.  Meals in prison tend to be very high in carbohydrates and very little nutritional value.  I had been seeing some success with the LeanGains style of eating, a small carton of milk, and a cup of vegetables.  Dinner was a similar setup and served at 4:30pm.  Fortunately I had access to commissary, and with a $75 per week spending limit, I loaded up on tuna (25 g protein), mackeral (18 g protein), protein shake packets (238 calories, 22 carb), and eat only one cup of the carbs.  Outside of the cafeteria the only tools I had to cook with were hot water

In keeping with the LeanGains style of eating, so my go to postworkout meal was 3 packets of instant oatmeal with 2 packets of protein powder.  This workout out to about 800 calories, 88 g protein, 125 g carbs.  I would also cycle carbs and calories lower on ab/lower back days and rest days while keeping protein intake around 180g.  Typically my postworkout meal would be the highest in carbs, and for the other meals I would skip the high carb options but giving away my macaroni and bread or trading it for a carton of milk.

Sample Day of eating (train in AM):

Lunch:

2 cups of macaroni, 1 milk, 1 cup veggies

Dinner:

2 packets of meat + 'meat slop', 1 cup veggies

Additional meal: 2 packets of tuna + cup of instant brown rice

1338256768.0,u9mwb,I'm a personal trainer and here's a few things to watch out for if you're considering personal training with a major corporate gym.,mterwall,2190,652,393,"I’ve wanted to write something like this for a while, are treated and deceived by major corporate gyms.  I’ll list my qualifications in the following paragraph

I graduated from UCSB in Ca where I studied accounting and sports and exercise science.  The following year I got my NASM personal training certification and worked as a personal trainer while I studied for my CPA accounting exams.  For a year and a half I worked at a major national gym, there are some differences and some are worse than others.  I have also taught group classes, coached high school basketball/volleyball, and was briefly the athletic trainer for a professional basketball team in Bangkok.  I had a great rapport with all my clients, dealt with them honestly, and after I became aware of unscrupulous activity no longer accepted clients from the sales team.  Since then I will never train for one of these corporate gyms, nor will I allow them to earn any revenue from any of my actions

The Sales Process: 

In most situations the sales team and the personal training personnel are two completely different departments in the gym.  Sales persons feed the training staff new clients and are paid commission as long as they hit their target quota, they are essentially working 12 hour days 6 days a week for about 8 bucks an hour.  With that being said the Sales team is under ridiculous pressure to sell training sessions, and often time shady practices are undertaken.  Additionally, and even more unsettling; they are in no way required to be certified, and are seldom qualified to give any sort of health related advice.  Yet, with no clinical information they will tell you, you are in imminent danger of heart disease.  They will be hyper critical of your weight and ask you how much weight you want to lose before you are comfortable with yourself.  They will say just about anything to make you feel like you need training.  Most gyms will offer a “free consultation from a personal trainer” in order to rope you into a contract.  9 times out of 10 the person leading this “consultation” was not a personal trainer, They would start off with an arbitrary method of body fat measurement: BMI index, which at my gym jovially referred to as “hazing”.  This being a horribly unsafe means of pushing a potential client to their limits (again with no reference to their prior medical history) in order to show them that they cannot exercise on their own and they are grossly out of shape.  It also was not uncommon for the sales person to flat out lie about the terms and rates of a training contract; Really

Personal Training:

The minimum qualification for a personal trainer to work at many of these major corporate gyms is a personal training certification.  Depending on the gym this can range from a cert. that can be obtained online in under two weeks, this is not at all sufficient in terms of assessing one’s knowledge.  The major problem with this particular certification is that NASM has a profit motive, meaning they make more money by selling more tests.  There is an economic advantage to having people fail; a lower pass rate implies a more prestigious cert. and obviously people pay to retake the exam.  Personally, found that the exam focused way too much on semantics rather than assessing knowledge of the body and training.  Ideally, I’d like to see a governing body without a profit motive certifying personal trainers.  The fact is, training is can be a very dangerous business.  If your trainer is unqualified or under qualified, there is way too much potential to make existing health problems worse or develop new ones or create new or exacerbate existing muscle imbalances.  Far too often I saw my colleagues guiding their clients through exercises incorrectly or having them do things that were extremely compromising to the body structurally.  

Nutrition:

Personal Trainers, not qualified to give nutritional or supplement advice.  We are not nutritionists and should not be advising (outside of basic nutritional knowledge) unless we have some sort of history in nutrition.  We do not have access to your medical history, and even if we did there’s no guarantee that we’d give you proper advice.  This fact is especially disturbing when giving supplement advice (some trainers at gyms are required to sell supplements and have monthly quotas).  This is extremely frightening given many supplements can affect heart functioning and have very little government oversight in terms of safety.  

Contractual issues pertaining to my gym:

Far too often, under qualified training.  I personally charged 30-40 for my private clients, which was an average rate for my area.  From each session the trainer would take $8; and are effectively making 15 dollars an hour taxed.  Unfortunately, when many of my colleagues became aware of this discrepancy (at times the gym could net 112 vs. the trainers’ 8 per session) they’d become disgruntled and take it out on their clients either with attitude or providing terrible service.  Canceling memberships or training was always a ridiculous hassle.  In order to cancel, clients were required to physically mail notification to the corporate office and the vast majority of the time, the notice would get “lost” ensuring another months of sessions/membership.  If there was no notification, they would continue to charge members’ credit cards, the contract rarely agreed with what the sales person promised.  

Other problems:

There were also a number of instances where a few “bad apple” trainers/sales persons would steal, unethical and dishonest behavior is indirectly encouraged from the top down within the corporation and in my experience is far too prevalent in the industry.

Things to do to protect yourself:

1.	Always ask your trainer/sales person their background.  It’s not rude at all.  It is your body they are working with and your health at risk
2.	Try to pay with cash whenever you can.  This prevents them from charging you past the contract period
3.	If possible ask a trainer if they’ll train you independent of a gym contract
4.	Always ask for a copy of your contract and read it.  Generally there’s a buyer’s remorse period and you can get out with very little penalty.  It’s generally company policy to not give you a copy unless you ask
5.	If you have questions r/fitness
6.	Don’t take any shit from sales people

I’ll be around for a while

TL;DR
1.	Sales people are dishonest and not qualified to tell you what you need
2.	Often times trainers are under qualified 
3.	Suggestions to help you from getting screwed.
4.   I'll be around,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,t3_u9mwb

I'm 5'10, in May, I was 175, but I've lost a few more inches since then, so it's likely I've lost a bit more weight too. My starting measurements were 46-36-46, and now I'm down to 37-29-39, so I've basically lost at least 7 inches in my circumference this year! (My dress size dropped from a size 16/18 to a size 8/10, albeit less flatteringly.)

[me holding the measuring tape where it used to be](http://i.imgur.com/zjCO0.png)

I started lurking on fittit/loseit last June, often more. I had to start slow, because, well, as my pictures would suggest I was extremely sedentary and obese. 

I use the TRX (www.trxtraining.com), which was one of my biggest issues; working out from home helped me keep up my routine long-term. However, it is an expensive system for what it is. I had been previously introduced to it through my old kickboxing gym and got it on sale (they generally offer 25% around Christmastime), but there's a LOT of suspension trainer DIY tutorials online that you should check out if suspension training interests you. In terms of cardio exercise, I walk a lot more (and enjoy spending hours going on walks), take the stairs (and walk up escalators), bike a lot in the summer. I'm much more into building muscle (I get really excited to show people I haven't seen for awhile my new biceps

I took the advice ""eat less, I do eat significantly smaller portions, and less junk food overall. I buy a lot more fruits and veggies, but I don't deprive myself of the things I'm craving. 

I've still got a bit more to lose, and I'm starting to feel good about my body and fitness. I'm currently stalling with my weight loss (but am still losing inches very slowly, so I can't reaaally call it a plateau). I'm considering intermittent fasting to take my diet to the next level and lose these last pounds. Also, if anyone has words of wisdom or advice about IF, I'd be much obliged!

The goal of this is to get huge and get bitches. You definitely want to be lifting as big as posssible without gaining any fat.  Most people will set a goal in the 20-30lbs of muscle gained and aim for about 6% body fat over the first semester. 

Here's the program:

**Workout drink**:
Muscle milk in a shaker bottle.  

**Warm up**:
Cardio machine for 20 mins. Middle row machine or behind the best yoga pants.  Don't sweat too much in case you see some ladies to talk to.

**Lifts / Reps / Weight**:

* **Smith Machine Squats** / 2x20 / just the bar (don't want the legs to get too big so you can get that V taper!)
* **Squat Rack Curls** / 4 sets to failure / heaviest weight you can get. (Gotta build those guns)
* **Barbell Bench Press** / 3 sets at 1RM / get your max on the bar so people dont make fun of you. its a psychological thing.
* **""Skinny Indian Guy"" Psychokinetic Chest Press** / 4 mins / No weight. You do this exercise by putting your body weight in plates on the hammer tech machine (about 120 lbs) and then staring at it while slouching. Don't worry
* **Dumbell Rack Dumbell Curls** / 2 sets to fail / Find a weight you can do 12 reps with then add 15 lbs to that. Make sure to get as close to the rack as possible. Gotta be alpha and claim your spot in the gym
* **Conversation Curls** / 1 min or 3 sentences / Find the biggest dude in the gym and try to talk to him while he's deadlifting. For the advanced version ask him how long until he's done when he's in the middle of his set.
* **Cable Machine** / 3 sets 12 reps / find any cable machine and pull on it for a little while. Make sure to get some protein in.
* **Arched Back Deadlift** / 2 sets 5 reps or to injury / Add an extra plate onto the bar so you can get big quicker. Don't worry about form
* **Standing Dumbbell Bicep Curls** / 2 sets 10 reps / use one size smaller than u did for Rack Dumbbell Curls since this is for hypertrophy. Arms are the first thing a woman sees.
* **Crunches** / Do about 50 on the exercise ball next to the cardio machines so you can be seen.

**Diet:**

U will see a lot of diet advice on the internet but just ignore it because 1. u don't wanna get too fat and 2. you gotta be able to account for the Natty Light at the house parties. What u wanna do is get almost entirely protein. So buy two tubs of muscle milk when the loan check arrives and then supplement with casein. Don't use creatine cause it will make you bloated! Your fat will come from pizza and just assume that your carbs will come from any alcohol calories. 

**Gym etiquette**:

1. Never take your sunglasses off. You have to keep from being distracted and the women won't know you're staring
2. If someone takes more than 30 seconds after a set they're probably done with that equipment so you can go ahead and move their stuff.
3. Unused incline benches are the perfect place to sit and talk to your friends.
4. ENJOY THE MIRIN BITCHES AND GETTING HUGE!! 

**Resources**:
Pretty much anything on Bodybuilding.com supplements section is going to be a good choice. Just make sure to always keep that body fat below 6%. ALWAYS CUT BEFORE YOU BULK! This is pragmatic because the best parties are in the fall so you don't have time to turn into a fat fuck if you are going to get laid.

I've had an issue with my weight my entire life. Last year Jan2012 it was at its worst. I was over 250lbs and 1/3 of my body was fat, in a non-narcissistic kind of way. If you set your mind entirely to something, then you can and will succeed. Don't sit around and let things bother you, FIX THEM

WEIGHT LOSS [-64lbs]:
Jan 2012- (253lbs)

DIET: Low Caloric and Low carb whenever I hit a plateau 
I didn't have a set diet regiment

ROUTINE: Diet doesn't matter so much when you're burning a crap ton of calories. I ran long distance to keep my heart rate elevated for long intervals and increased my mile distance weekly. Directly after running I would go immediately to the gym. I just did my thing in the gym.

**EDIT**

You can find most of my answers to questions in the comments below

* How much did it all cost?

Some of the equipment (the treadmill, I will be replacing it with a Body-solid Incline/decline bench soon. The power rack with the lat attachment and 210 lb weight stack was $1200, the dip/leg lift station was $330, the ab board was $260. The Bowflex SelectTech 1090s were $600 + $130 for the stand. The Olympic bar, weight tree, and 350 lbs of olympic weights was around $700. The PC was ~$500, the corner PC desk was $100, the flooring was ~$700

* How are you going to Deadlift without breaking the floor?

The floor sits on a concrete slab

* How do you learn a skill like this/are you a contractor?

It came fairly naturally to me. I just always loved working with wood and I'm rather methodical so it's right up my alley. In the past I've built many rooms (bedrooms, a playground for my kids, an elaborate deck off my house in my back yard, etc. I'm not a contractor, I just really enjoy this kind of stuff.

* Why no mirrors?

In time. Just haven't had the chance to get any yet.

* How do you manage overhead press

I don't :( Unfortunately I am somewhat limited in what I can do with this space as it's only 7'9"" tall. So I have to settle with seated military/overhead presses instead of standing. Also


That's all for now. If any other questions arise I will add those. Thank you all for your kind words

Then I wonder, she's funny, and very charismatic. Yet, I can't get over the fact that she's very very out of shape and doesn't seem to take it seriously.

Not long after I thanked her for the great night and left. She was visibly disappointed, I've come to realize how my own daily efforts at the gym have shaped the way I perceive myself and others. I don't devalue them, nor to I overvalue myself, however I've come to realize that the discipline I've developed affects me in various parts of my life, not just in fitness. It helps me eat well, not just well, but fucking amazingly. It helps me sleep better, I'm writing this at work at the moment), but they should at least take it a bit more seriously than Wii Fit. 

In the end, I just said that I didn't feel an emotional connection. We're still very good friends, because you can't fake the way we got along so well. A part of me feels as though I might have made a mistake, that a person's body will eventually fade and what will remain is your ability to get along with them (which we did, and continue to very well). But again, I just don't see myself being with someone who cannot take their physical health seriously anymore. 

**TL;DR: Met a girl over POF, backed off because I wasn't attracted to her. Had a few days of personal soul-searching, came to the conclusion that I have to be true to myself.**

**EDIT**
So it seems that I'm getting a lot of 'you just weren't attracted to her' and a lot of 'you're an ass and you should feel bad'. Either I'm right or I'm wrong, and in a roundabout way that led to me finding justifications for walking. I am and continue to be very attracted to her other aspects of her personality, and that makes me feel really bad for not giving myself a chance to get to know that side better. We agreed to stay in each other's lives, and continue to message back and forth over facebook (even openly admitting that it's better now that we know where we stand), and somehow I feel incredibly bitter sweet about the whole thing.

**Training**

* Squat: I was really struggling to make progress on squatting with 5/3/1, which is an amazingly effective program. I made it to a [pretty ugly 350x5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TWj_uQalc4) before I mentally couldn't keep up with two intense squatting sessions per week (especially since it's summer, which means lots of cycling / basketball / doing fun stuff outside). 

* Bench/OHP: Straightforward 5/3/1 BBB the entire year. I've heard a lot of people say that benching or pressing once per week isn't enough to make progress

* Deadlift: In theory I've been doing 5/3/1, my DL has gone up a lot, probably due to the effects of squatting. I'm planning to try running 5/3/1 for both squat and DL at the same time to see if I can get anywhere.

* Accessories: I do weighted chins and rows about once per week each. That along with the BBB sets are the only accessory work I ever do. Recently started doing some push presses for the fun of it.

**Other exercise**

* Cycling: I did a lot of cycling last fall (probably a big factor in why my squat wasn't progressing back then)

* Basketball / tennis recreationally

**Diet**

[Weight over time](http://i.imgur.com/tvMAaQH.png) (each tick at the bottom is 3 months

I've measured progress as outlined in [this post](http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html):

* Strength Goals: Intermediate -- ""Within two years of consistent training on a decent routine, Squat: BWx1.6, Deadlift: BWx2"" **DONE**

* Strength Goals: Advanced -- ""3 out of 4 of the following goals should be reached within five years: Bench press: BWx1.5, Deadlift: BWx2.5"" [I could probably do chins or get close (never tried 1rm before), squat is close, and bench/DL feel a long ways away]

I started calorie counting

http://i.imgur.com/m5aES.jpg - before

http://i.imgur.com/QM7pe.jpg - after


Update re: my diet and exercise routine. Diet wise I worked out my maintenance calories with -1000. At the beginning this was about 1700 cals per day. The aim was for 200 cals exercise per day (on average). To be honest I wasn't in a too bad state for my size. I was reasonably active and aerobically wasn't too bad (relatively) due to many years of playing a brass instrument so I was okay with doing exercise. At first I started going on walks (3/4/5/6 miles). Then I started swimming again (did this alot as a kid). I went before work and did about 1/2 a mile each day. This continued for about 6 months then I decided I should go to the gym. As soon as I started going I hired a trainer there; mainly because I really had no idea what to do. I knew I should be doing weight training, deadlifts etc. About 6 months ago I started running. Now I usually do 2 x 1hr sessions with my trainer. Then I swim 4 x a week (1/2 mile). In addition I usually do 1 or 2 more sessions of either running or weight training; whatever takes my fancy. In terms of food I would stick within the calorie allowance, but do eat a variety of foods. I don't do low-carb, but generally eat little bread. I eat alot of fresh vegetables and fruit. We have our own allotment garden and grow much ourselves. This is also good exercise! A typical day for me would be oats for breakfast with honey and banana, lunch: homemade soup, some fruit, boiled egg and greek yoghurt. Dinner stir fry with veg

hopefully this proves that it is the same person for those that don't believe it.

Now that I'm at the weight that I would like to be around

I forgot to add what my diet and training were like

My diet consistently is eating several times throughout the day with small snacks.

My main meals were typically this:

**Breakfast**: protein shake with a half cup of oatmeal

**Lunch**: usually a sandwich with turkey or chicken and loaded with veggies

**Dinner**: Is almost always something different so it's hard to say what exactly but usually would incorporate half veggies, or lean beef.

Throughout the day I have 2-3 protein shakes and will usually have some homemade toast or banana bread to get some sugars.

**Before Bed**: I will typically have a bowl of Fiber 1 before bed to get extra fiber as well as to fill me up with some carbs


My training routine has recently changed. Through out the summer I mainly focused on road biking usually going distances ~50km and sometimes up to ~100km on Sundays or randomly through out the week. Towards the end of summer I started to transfer into the gym doing mainly isolation workouts with extreme intensity

As I stated in the original post I am now focusing mainly on strength building and my routine is one that I made myself with lots of information from other ones

**Monday and Thursday**: Squats, hamstring curl, calves.
I'll typically throw in different variations or other things in there but the core squats and dead lifts all ways.

**Tuesday, military press or standing press, wide grip pull ups, dips, and barbell rows. Also with this I'll throw in different things as well.

**Saturday or Sunday**: I'll usually do around a 3-5km run just to keep my cardio up.

I don't really believe in cheat days

I finished my set and look up at him and he straight away introduced himself, explained what muscles this exercise works on and even demonstrated for me.

THEN... he started asking me how long I'd been going to the gym, then he offered to show me some other exercises. I took him up on his offer and asked him to show me how to do squats. So he spent the next 20 minutes slowly explaining, demonstrating, watching me squat, correcting me and all that stuff. It was the best gym session I had ever done and I was so excited I finally learned how to do squats (BTW, squats feel so fucking good. My whole body felt like it was getting a workout!).

After all this

I can't even describe how over the moon I am. I've been going to the gym for about 3 months now. I haven't got a set schedule; I just turn up and do what I feel like, bench press etc but I have no friends who go to this gym who can show me and I'm already signed up for a 12 month contract (also too scared to ask random people in the gym). I feel like now I can actually get a proper routine going and really build my strength.

I'm pretty damn excited to be going to the gym now!

Edit: Lots of people are wondering this

Edit 2: I guess I'm kinda surprised at all the negative comments regarding not using the FAQ, I went straight to the FAQ, then YouTube to watch how certain exercises are done. However, I'm not the kind of person who can visually see an exercise, then confidently and comfortably do it myself. I'd be way too worried about doing it wrong the first time, then always doing it wrong. I wouldn't be sure if my feet were wide enough, whether I was sticking my bum out enough or whatever. The small things that you need people to observe you doing from the outside.

Also, then I simply won't do the free session. Maybe, like someone commented, I'll actually pay him for the free session. I'll just have to work out whether it's a good investment for me.",,False,,1375996680.0,t3_1jy0xm

If you've been reading [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) for more than a year

We love new community members here!  So many of our old community members came here with almost no knowledge of fitness

* Most of the new users are going to come here, and then *actually go read it* (which takes about 45 minutes in total).  We may not notice such new users until they ask a good question (because they read the FAQ) and even then, they may not be noticeable. They are the great silent majority of our users.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's welcoming and friendly and lets new people know that [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) is a place where they can get information about improving their fitness.   I've counted: about 25% of the time

Also, your answering this way above saves the time and effort someone more knowledgeable would have to spend answering the question, or referring to the FAQ themselves.  It's classic division of labor -- there are far more people who know less (or are less certain) about fitness than who know more, but they can be extremely useful giving the simple answer ""Here's how it's addressed in the FAQ!"".  Thus, **even if you don't feel knowledgeable about fitness, if you know the question is answered in the FAQ, you're doing everyone here a big favor if you post the above copypasta.**

More importantly: I recommend you use the copypasta because *we need you fresh for the actually hard questions.*   You see

You only have so much time and energy.  And, how I can I get fit?""  you get antsy, and upset.  Don't these people learn? Don't they see the other posts and know they should read the FAQ?  It becomes easy to look past the point that all these new people are completely new, they've never seen [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) before, and they don't benefit from its past. So you might find yourself getting angry with them, and it's tempting to write something snippy or sarcastic.  **Don't**.  When you reach the point that you are feeling snippy and sarcastic to the new kids, it's time to step aside, and let others pick up the slack.  

Finally, even though the same information you're providing is already in the FAQ.   But they're likely to start by snapping at you for telling them to read the FAQ ""when I've already read it and question's not in there"" (it is); or by saying ""I wanted to talk to someone, not read some wall of text.""  Such posters can be exhausting.  Don't feel like you have to answer all their questions -- in fact, you can ignore them and just move on if you like.  It's unreasonable for new people to believe they deserve individualized fitness and diet coaching, particularly when their fitness needs are identical to the vast majority of people who come here.  This is often referred to as the ""snowflake problem""; so many who come here think their problems are unique, like snowflakes, when in fact, and so the solution is identical.  

**TL; DR**

* Read each submission in the new queue carefully. 
* Refer new users who ask questions answered in the FAQ directly to the FAQ. Use the provided welcoming copypasta.   
* Don't answer questions if you feel frustrated by the repeated questions of new people.  Move away from the new queue
* Beware of the 'snowflakes': users who think they are unique -- and so deserve unique

**Finally** here are the top five comments from last year's discussion: 

* **flynnzo (289 points)** Please remember, or younger, or older with zero knowledge of what to do.  If you do write, be welcoming.  Don't ask girls for pics ""for science"" or tell them to go to gonewild, they're here for fitness.
Downvote people being dickish

* **eric_twinge (70 points)** I'll make a plug for another route people can take.  If you *think* you know the answer to the question, commenting makes you a part of the community and recognizable.  Cutting your chops on the beginner posts is a great way to get involved.  

* **therewontberiots (48 points)** Hey, mostly saying hi and look forward to taking better care of my body.

* **FastRedPonyCar (44 points)** I saw 3 people walk into the relatively small gym I workout at last night to speak with the head trainer on ""getting started"". Now I'm not a big guy at ALL but I'm in shape and I was working out right next to where one of the guys waiting to talk to the trainer while his buddy was talking with the trainer and he had this crazy scared/intimidated look on his face the whole time.   He wasn't in shape at all and it was pretty clear he was uncomfortable.    After that set

* **austinb (24 points)** This can also be a great time to help **IMPROVE** the FAQ. There are still many questions that come up fairly often that are not directly addressed in the faq, directing people to resources or other subreddits that directly address their goals, for example the program picker, [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) , [/r/gainit](/r/gainit) , [/r/BTFC](/r/BTFC) , [/r/GetMotivated](/r/GetMotivated)

Anytime I wanted to talk about a plateau I broke or some weight loss subject it would be huge fight.  I have a feeling its was more of a preemptive strike. ""I better leave him before he leaves me"" type of deal?  Which makes me sad in a way but the crap she put me through this last year makes me less sad shes gone.

**ABOUT MY STORY:  (thanks for reading!)**
Last year (June 12th) I had this weird urge to step on a scale.  I had always known I was HUGE and getting bigger but I was always under the impression that I would always be 300lbs.  Maybe + or – 10lbs but generally I usually stayed within that boundary.  So I stepped on the scale and saw a horrid sight!  330 POUNDS!!  I was just in shock at that point and just felt it was time to make a change.  I knew nothing of weight loss or dieting.  Besides trying weight watchers a few times unsuccessfully.

So I went out and purchased an elliptical.  Found a really nice Sole elliptical for 300 bucks on Craigslist that retails for 1500.  You would be surprised how many people sell these things cheap with minimal use.  I also started weight watchers again and started counting points.  When I first started I could do about 10-15 min on the elliptical before I was running for the couch I had downstairs

I was still on weight watchers counting points and just cutting out all the shitty fast food and soda(btw soda is my downfall love it soooo much).  Before I knew it I had lost 30lbs in the first month!  I was like No shit?  Got me really excited and motivated.  So with a growing confidence I added walking outside to my workout regiment.  I could really only walk for a good 20 min before I was tired but I was soon jogging intervals on hour long walks.  I continued to lose about 10lbs every 3-4 weeks (as you can see in my progress pics)  I could not believe how fast it was just rolling off.

I soon got off Weight watchers after about 2 months.  I just felt like the points thing was unnecessary and it was the same exact thing as counting calories.  It seemed like Weight watchers was just a way to train your mind how much you can eat.  Its not a lifetime solution

I continued on counting calories and walking/elliptical for months.  When I started to get bored I got the P90 program (not p90x).  I started to do that around October.  It was fun for a while but it got boring FAST.  But I did do it for a good 60-70 days.  But to be honest I did not lose weight any faster on that than I did walking/elliptical.  But it was a nice distraction.  I was getting real bored around November and did have some slip ups throughout the holidays.  I made an agreement with myself that I would NOT join a gym until I lost 100lbs on my own.  I thought it was a nice round number and seemed like a good goal.  So in almost eerie type fashion I lost my 100th pound December 31st.   And joined the gym on new years day.  (yeah I am sure everyone labeled me a new years resolution guy but ohh well I got a good deal on my membership!)

So I have been spending the last 5 months going to the gym 3-5 times a week.  I quickly found out how boring my old routine was and preferred the gym’s equipment and atmosphere much more.  I lost another 30lbs in 5 months.  (I have had quite a few slip ups the last 2 months that had me yo-yoing back and forth between 195 and 210.  The problem is that when you start to like the way you look you get less concerned with eating right and maintaining a rigid workout schedule.  But I am persevering and continue to push myself until I am HAPPY with the way I look not just satisfied.

At the gym I generally do M-W-F lifting.  I will do upper body M-F and lower body on Wed.  Then on Tues and Thurs are cardio days and I will do an hour on various cardio machines.  I did the C25K thing for a few weeks but I quickly lost all motivation for cardio and focus mainly on lifting.  I finally hit 200lbs at the end of April and just have not got a chance to post until now.  Hopefully you will all approve.

**THE DIET:  (usually within 1200-1500 calories a day)**
I did weight watchers at first just eating whatever as long as I marked down the points.  I cut out fast food and soda completely.  After a while I just started counting calories.  I never paid any attention to carbs/protein/fats.  I started to for a few weeks but I did not see any amazing difference to my weight loss/muscle gain.  Plus I just don’t like to be restricted on what I want to eat.  Sure I know I have to restrict HOW MUCH I eat but I do not like food restrictions.  The way I was able to maintain for so long was discovering which foods made me full for the longest and strategizing what time of the day I should eat so I never am starving and feel the urge to cheat.

So generally this is how I ate for most of it

**Breakfast Items: (WATER WATER WATER)**
Egg white cheese omelets (those ones in the cartons are AWESOME)


Glass of skim milk or OJ.


Morning Glory Sausage patties (80 cal and soo good)


Fruit of your choice


Almond Milk (this is awful solo but add the light Hershey syrup and its awesome)


Yogurt


**Lunch/Dinner Items: (WATER WATER WATER)**
Oatmeal &lt;awesome way to keep full for long periods&gt;


Serving of Almonds


Full bag of Smart Pop popcorn (kettle corn is the best)


Turkey Sandwich on wheat bread (get deli cut turkey so much less sodium)


String Cheese


Chocolate Rice Cakes


Wheat Spaghetti


Tuna fish sandwich 


Wheat crust pizza (homemade)


Sugar free snack packs


Flavor Ice


Yogurt

So what did I do to get to where I am now? Well, most importantly, **kept my diet clean**.  I cannot stress the importance of nutrition enough.

My diet, wings, and dark chocolate.  Personally, I am miserable with restriction.  I allow myself some treats here and there because it makes me happy.  I don't gorge on food - I savor it.  That understanding, that relationship with food, took a long time to construct.   If you're eating shit food and want to eat healthier, it's best to incorporate those changes slowly so that the replacement is long term rather than short term. **It isn't a diet - it's a lifestyle change.**  Take a few things out per week and allow your body to acclimate to the healthier changes.  When grocery shopping, fresh food and cook it yourself with spices that don't contain chemicals or sugars.  I eat about 90% Paleo. 
 
From the point that I made that post 6 months ago I ended up getting my heart broken to pieces, maybe 4x a week.  I stepped it up a notch in August and have been going 3-5 days a week.  My box also offers pure strength training classes in the mornings which I have been attending as well.  Lifting weights is the best thing to happen to me in a long time, maybe even my entire life!

I got in the gym fairly regularly my junior and senior years of high school (was a soccer player, I had lost a lot of ground. Here is what I looked like at the end of that time. I wasn’t too keen to have pictures of my physique at this time, so I don’t have any better-quality photos (what I’d give for one though—to those of you who are beginning to pursue fitness, take some good “before” photos so you can see just how far you’ve come!

[**13 Months (Current)**](http://imgur.com/a/v90ZB)

Weight: 170 lbs
Height: 5’ 10.5”

Feeling very encouraged with my progress. Not nearly “there” yet



**Workout Schedule**


I opt of for a 4-5 day split per week. The major lifts like bench press, rows, etc. form the backbone of my training. Then, I'll add other more peripheral movements around these that usually vary by week. I can’t give you an exact workout plan I followed the entire time because it changes constantly! The split usually looks something like:


Day 1: Chest

Day 2: Back

Day 3: Hamstrings

Day 4: Shoulders and any lagging muscle group

Optional day 5: abs or any lagging muscle group.



When I’m working out

Intensity is key to your workout. It’s a mental game

As you’ve probably noticed, I’ve tried to do my legs twice a week. Again, it changes a lot because I usually conform my workout schedule around my academic schedule. A decent rule of thumb: if it’s not sore, you should probably be working it.


**Diet**


Generally, although I have in the past. I simply try to avoid high calorie and processed foods, get 150 grams of protein a day or more, and get a lot of variety in fruits and vegetables. I think I have a reasonably fast metabolism, but more importantly, I’ve developed good, clean eating habits so I don’t really struggle too much with gaining excess fat. Instead, I’ll have a more stringent diet plan. 

My supplements include creatine and whey. I’m not really a supplement guy right now.

Don’t forget about rest! I get between 7.5 and 9 hours per night. You grow during your rest and sleep


**Philosophy**


You can never stop striving for your goal

When it comes to lifting, I recently changed the way I do pullups so that I target my latissmus dorsi more effectively by pulling my elbows wider and pausing at the top of the lift while mentally forcing the lats to contract. This severely reduces the number I can do, but is much more effective. For more information on this, watch some of Kai Greene’s “train with Kai” videos.

I’ve found that consistency and intensity are essential and the primary reason for my results. I truly believe anyone with the dedication and know-how can do what I’ve done. The question is

I think it's time for another [28-Day Handstand Challenge](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness)

We did the [28-Day Handstand Challenge](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness) few months ago and had great success.  When I first did this in December

When I did it again in January

Thus

Here's how it works:

* Read [this article](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness) that explains the basics of the challenge.
* If you want more guided direction
* Keep a simple check-box-training-log to keep up with your commitment.

That's it.  The program is designed for **adults to quickly learn the handstand.** By following this very basic program

&gt;""I just started the program - on Day 3 - and I'm surprised by the fact that I can already hold myself up there for almost the full minute without a break! I never thought to walk up the wall backwards so thanks for posting that tip with your original 28-day program."" -[porkburp](/u/porkburp)

.
&gt;"" I can clearly state

.
&gt;""Been doing the program and can hold for 2.5 mins against the wall

.
&gt;""An awesome program to follow and go along SL5x5."" -[olbapazem](/u/olbapazem)

&gt;""It's like you read my mind

People of all ages from 18 to 65 have taken the challenge with good results.

1366895913.0,1d2wrh,Starting Poop - A beginner's guide to healthy and enjoyable pooping,MStranahan,2263,908,483,"Ok so I have wanted to write this post for a while now. This is a topic that most people face everyday
Especially all people who are eating a lot in general to pursue fitness goals and all people in general who consume a lot of protein may find it hard sometimes to excrete all the bodie's waste in a healthy and pleasant fashion. I don't want to go into too much detail here but basically if it hurts, then you are doing something wrong. So here follows some quick tips:

**Fiber/Fibre**
Yes this is the golden building block that you will need in order to achieve a clean colon and perfect consistency of the matter. The majority of fibre should come from vegetables, nuts, and grains but just google lists of fibre rich foods.

If you struggle with getting the amount of fibre needed into your system or you just want to hardcore fibre cleanse your body then you should invest in some psyllium husk. This is a natural seed that you can get as the seed itself
This is like fairy powder

So without fibre

**Squatted Pooping**
Ok so now that we have perfect poop we will want to optimise the pooping process itself. I always find it is utmost satisfying if I have the feeling that the process is smooth and cleansing and that it leaves you 10 pounds lighter. 
Fun fact: Sitting isn't the optimal pooping position

So how can I incorporate the squat into my bathroom session? Well there are superfluous gadgets you can buy to get you into the squatting position above your toilet but the easiest way is to take of all your clothes beneath your waistline and just squat on the toilet seat. This takes time to master but it seriously makes everything better. Just make sure that your toilet supports your full weight and that you can support yourself on a wall or similar object so you don't fall. That would be really embarrassing. Also I am not accountable for anything bad that happens to you if you try this. I will however laugh if you tell me about it.
And one last thing that guys have to remember is to point your schlong downwards into the bowl otherwise you'll have a bad time.

So that's it

**Edit:** Ok Ok, as you wouldn't want to fall and knock yourself out on the floor with your pants down. A shard in the ass probably also isn't very fun. So maybe this could help if you don't want to squat on the toilet as suggested by DirtyHotDog: http://www.squattypotty.com/

**Edit 2** Well

Ok so to elaborate on all the comments:

Yes
Squatting on the toilet should be practiced with care

For pooping on the go

Also you can experiment with raising your feet on a stool or something like that to get into the squatting position but I personally don't think its that comfortable half sitting in the bowl with my pillermann squeezed between my legs.

1376397478.0,1k9vpe,Something rarely discussed here or in articles: Ridicule and discouragement from loved ones when seeing results,slendrman,1897,551,687,"I'm writing this after recent events involving my girlfriend

I have rarely read any articles in here about negative views towards fitness. I have seen lots of talk about overweight people trying to make a positive change and getting made fun of at the gym (name calling from douchy gym rats, and (very) long story short, cut down to 175 and began years of weight training and nutrition ([album after cutting down](http://imgur.com/a/vxUW7)).

Anyways

""Maybe you should take one day off *a year* man""

""So is body image the most important thing to you now?""

""Wow this shit has really gotten to your head

Endless comments not congratulating me on my success, people tried to find negative reasons for why I counted my calories, undertook grueling fitness regimens and stopped treating my body like a garbage can. After I used to eat like a pig, they decided I must have some psychological problems, self esteem issues, and even an addiction problem.

This eventually gave way, close friends, and family).

ANYWAYS

My current girlfriend of about 9 months began her transformation about a year ago. I'd known her for a couple years before we started dating, lost 30 lbs, is now in the middle of her healthy weight range, goes to the gym 2 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, and watches everything that she eats.

Guess what?

However bad my discouragement and ridicule from loved ones was

""You look sick and disgusting now"" - (overweight) best friend of years

""We are worried about you"" - other friends

""This isn't like you"" - some family

""She just doesn't eat

The list goes on.

She gets this shit maybe two - three times a week. What's worse, tell her they think she's doing this to impress me (she started before we dated), and that they have never seen her like this.

I know that she is the happiest she's ever been (and /r/fitness you know what it's like to feel so much better about yourself after making large healthy changes). But these comments are so discouraging she hides going to the gym, unnatural foods when with them to try and ward off some of the negativity. She cries to me at night, tells me she doesn't want to keep on in this healthy manner if this is how people will treat her.

So, I have some pre-typed out emails ready to send to everyone individually, void of any cursing or threats, just letting them know what they are doing to her. She has told me not to say anything, begged me to leave it alone and let her deal with. 

What do I do?

**TL;DR Girlfriend is getting told from best friends and family she has self esteem and addiction problems for going to the gym so much, enrages me. Asks me not to say anything to her friends, but I am thinking I should just unleash a shit storm on them. What do?**

Edit: I apologize for the misleading title

**CONCLUSION: So the responses here are so incredibly in depth and helpful, and even people telling me that we are being big babies.  All of it was helpful, and I even stole some of your quotes to make her feel better, [which seemed to have helped](http://i.imgur.com/ZRZnBcp.jpg?1).  People, turns out that success makes others bitter, and whether it's jealousy, ignorance of a subject, you know what's best for you.

1351016515.0,11yihw,An open letter from Muscle &amp; Fitness' Editor-in-chief calling out Guinness and challenging them to test the man with the world's largest biceps. This could get interesting...,cromano923,1737,397,492,"Muscle &amp; Fitness' Editor-in-Chief Shawn Perine isn't buying it. He's got a challenge for Guinness and he's willing to put his money where his mouth is. 

Dear Guinness Record Keepers
You've been duped. Or maybe you just made a bad judgment call. Either way, at least. By anointing Moustafa Ismail the possessor of the world's largest biceps you've discredited your Book of World Records and cast doubt on the veracity of everything inside of it.

When I was a kid, richest and oldest—and your annual tome fed my hunger for such knowledge. I would read it cover to cover many times over throughout the 70's and 80's. I'd toss around names like Robert Earl Hughes, Robert Pershing Wadlow and Lucia Zarate with such regularity an outsider might have thought I was referring to beloved family members. As the world's heaviest, tallest and shortest persons, they were held in nearly such estimation by my younger self.

Based on the sober explanation of the Guinness standards in the front of your book, if that were the case, the man you list as having the world's largest biceps could actually have arms full of a synthetic compound encasing rather modest biceps. Oh, wait…

I won't get into the technical details of what's going on with Mr. Ismail's arms, to search any of a number of bodybuilding forums for the word ""synthol"" for examples of dozens of men with arms that look identical to Mr. Ismail's. There's a telltale look to injected arms: a smooth, bloated appearance with zero separation between biceps and triceps, upper arms disproportionately larger than forearms, and no difference in shape between a relaxed and flexed arm. That's because you can't flex oil.

Now, then you may have a contender in Mr. Ismail. However, I would guess that the pendulous arms of the world's heaviest living human being, 1400-pound Manuel Uribe's, might stretch the tape further than Moustafa Ismail's. You might want to check on that.

If you're interested in verifying that the man you named as having the biggest biceps in the world (as you once, I will personally foot the bill to have a medical evaluation performed that would determine their composition. If I'm wrong in my belief, and they are entirely muscle—all 31"" of them—I will give Mr. Ismail $1000 for his troubles and donate $1000 to the charity of your choice. If I'm right though, and Mr. Ismail's arms are a combination of muscle and additives designed to increase their volume (force-fed flesh, if you will), I ask that you donate $1000 to my favorite charity and award the title to any one of a number of professional bodybuilders in contention for having the largest muscular arms in the world. I can help direct you to my top candidates.

By the way

I didn't know that by making that decision I was going to become borderline obsessed with fitness.

I kept it simple at first.  I did 2 rounds of Insanity and saw awesome results by just simply losing the fat and eating healthy.  I then did the Insanity Asylum series to start building up some of the muscle I lost or never had and then when I decided to bulk up I did Beachbody's Body Beast program - some might laugh
As of recently I've started the MFT28 schedule from bodybuilding.com - it's really high in volume

Being new to the idea of fitness and weightloss can be overwhelming. Especially in a get it now and get it fast article-driven world. Have you ever tried finding weight loss tips online? It's ridiculous. They'll try to convince you that honey... or peppers... or grapefruits are magical

Firstly, or was able to motivate them to start making a change in their life.

Everyone who has shared a comment, story, or laugh...thank you! Y'all continue to push me and motivate me in ways I doubt I'll ever be able to fully or even properly explain...it's one of the most fucked up things is finding a friend on Facebook linking you to your own photos being used for an inspirational meme, or ripping you off to sell fat burning pills haha

My diet hasn't changed too much - I am currently eating LeanGains style, and doing so within an 8 hour time period every day. I'm hoping to add a bit more to my frame while keeping relatively lean. 

Additionally, and I'm hoping to help those that who are looking for it in return. These pages are all brand new as of today, so if you join them, I'll get content on the move soon enough!

As for me, but I really am not sure. I am currently training 2 friends - 1 for 2 months now, and another friend who has gone from 315lbs Sept. 1 and was sitting 201.5 as of today! I keep telling him to post to Reddit and he promises to once he's under 200...

Lifts since last time in pounds: 

Bench: 240 - 255 1RM
Squat: 240 - 265 1RM
Deadlift: 355 to 415 1RM (set yesterday! Form was piss

So I guess that's all! Just wanted to share, and support, I can't say I'd of made it without the Interwebz.

I thought the weight loss was the hardest part

To lose the weight I participated in a medically supervised program

As far as my exercise routine, elliptical, bike, etc. I also do a bit of strength training. On average, I spent 60-70 minutes per day working out. I don't usually take a day off but rather I have a day or two each week where I might spend a little bit less time working out and being easier on my body.

Motivation? I was on the road to being one of those very young people with diabetes, but I'm still working on it. I am surrounded by a tremendous amount of people who offer amazing support no matter water. Also, they provide accountability, which is so important.

**[One comment hit the nail on the head](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/14mkta/i_lost_my_training_partner_last_week_i_beg_you/c7ehhng)- there's definitely a therapeutic value to exercise. I've always found it a great outlet for stress, and anxiety. The weights give back what you give to them, and even though the floor felt a bit emptier last than it ought to be, I can hope that while he was still there he was content in those moments.**

**Tonight the people in his life will have a chance to get some closure


My long time lifting partner, 22, engaged to be married, father to an infant, new job, fresh off of probation, finally clean and sober and ready to tackle life.

Cut short.

He overdosed on heroin Thursday night. Clean and sober for months

He leaves behind a son and a wife-to-be, and countless friends. I'm haunted at night to think, I pushed him, hard. I pushed him so hard in the gym. He trained with me all through prep for my first show.

He had endless potential... He had a checkered past

And one day he just stopped coming. A few weeks went by and I couldn't contact him. And then one day he called me and told me he was coming home, got a new place to stay with his fiancee and son, he was coming back to the gym, ready to do the natural bodybuilder thing, ready to make it right.

I tried to get in touch with him week after week- late hours, he seemed so bummed. He was so amped up to come back, but the timing was all off. I brushed it off, I understood. Life happens.

I wish I had tried harder. I wish I had rode his ass and dragged him into the weight room every night. Kicking and screaming if I had to because I know he wouldn't get into trouble if he was there with me. I know he wouldn't be out getting fucked up.

Addiction is a serious disease. There are those of us who haven't been personally affected

I couldn't relate. I just wish I had one more day with that fucker... One more hour of raw pulls, sweat and tears and memories. I wish I could have been the hard-ass good influence when he needed it the most. He fucking looked up to me and I wasn't there.

Now all I have is questions. What ifs...

If your friend is in pain, and I hate myself for not recognizing the warning signs. You never know when it might be your last chance to make a difference.

I hope none of you ever have to experience this hurt.",,t5_2qhx4,1355233980.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/14mkta/i_lost_my_training_partner_last_week_i_beg_you/

http://en.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bly8t/strength_size_and_the_truth_about_rep_ranges/

I’ve been planning this post for a while. I think the users of /r/gainit will benefit greatly from learning the difference between lifting for strength and lifting for size. I’ve made brief comments in the past about it, right?). We’ll get to that. First, I’d like to give you a brief introduction into the two main types of hypertrophy. 

*****

### Myofibrillar hypertrophy

*****

Myofibrillar hypertrophy, which are the contractile proteins in the myofibrils (the type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers, or the “fast-twitch” fibers). In simpler terms, when lifting heavy weights and putting your muscles under new stress (**progressive overload** -- increasing either the volume or weight of a lift every workout to ensure increased myofibrillar hypertrophy), your body will respond by strengthening it’s ability to contract its muscles. 

The recruited motor units in the movements also increase with myofibrillar hypertrophy, hence the need to progressively increase weight.  Ultimately, the effect is an increase in the strength and response of your fast-twitch muscle fibers. The “stronger” your fast-twitch fibers, the “stronger” the neuromuscular response, and the heavier the weight you are able to lift.

*****

### Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy

*****

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, glycogen, creatine phosphate, and water. In simpler terms, when sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occurs, the amount of fluid (or cytoplasm) in the muscle increases (expands), creating a larger muscle. This type of hypertrophy is achieved by using slower

Note that increasing the size of a muscle **does not** require an increase in the amount of contractile protein in the myofibrils

*****

### How do I train for the different types of hypertrophy? 

*****

The primary way to train for size or strength is to measure the time under tension

Neuromuscular training focuses on the nerves and increasing the contractile proteins in the myofibrils. This is specialized by keeping your muscles under very heavy stress (within 85-100% of your 1RM)

Metabolic training focuses on the supply of energy of muscles

You may have noticed that there is a gap between 75-85% of your 1RM between these levels of training. That is because that is the spot where these two forms of training are generally on an even level (i.e. you will increase strength and size in a somewhat equal manner).

*****

### How should I measure my 1 rep maximum and the related percentages?

*****

Fortunately

*****

### How should I measure the time my muscles are under tension in accordance with my goals?

*****

The easiest way to do this is to adhere to a specific rep scheme. Naturally, when completing a higher amount of reps your muscles will be under tension for longer, and the weight will need to a be a little further from your maximum to allow for the higher volume (and therefore building size through metabolic training). Here are the rep guidelines to follow for your specific training goals:

Rep Range|Percent of 1 Rep Max|Achieved Amounts of Hypertrophy|
:---|:---:|---:|
1-5 Reps|85-100%|Mostly myofibrillar
6-8 Reps|75-85%|A near equal moderate amount of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic|
9-12 Reps|70-75%|Largely sarcoplasmic
13-15 Reps|65-70%|Mostly sarcoplasmic
15+ Reps |65% and below|Largely endurance

*Note that as you more you increase the reps beyond 15

*****

### How do I use this information to create a workout routine to meet my goals?

*****

First, or do you want to work on both at the same time? There is nothing wrong with any of these goals, and each has their own pros/cons:

* Primarily training for strength is a goal that has few cons, and overtraining can occur easily. If you want to train for strength, employ set/rep schemes such as 5x5, 6x4, 8x3 with high rest periods in between sets. Lift within 85% of your 1RM at 5 reps, and increase the percentage as you decrease reps.
* Primarily training for size is a goal that has benefits, you will eventually hit a wall in the gains you are able to make due to a lack of increased strength, and you will have to focus some on strength training at some point (this is the reason strength programs are recommended for beginners). The lower your level of strength, the sooner you are going to hit a plateau.  If you want to train primarily for size, employ set/rep schemes such as 3x15, 4x12, and 5x9 with a lower rest period in between sets. Supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest in between) also becomes a strong option to deplete even more energy. Lift at least 65% of your 1RM
* Training for both strength and size is in my opinion the best way to go. You get the benefits of both forms of training at the same time.  There are two methods that I recommend to achieve this:

## Method #1: Traditional Strength/Size Optimization Training

Employ set rep schemes such as 4x8, 80% for 7 reps, and ~85% for 6 reps. 

## Method #2: Linear Periodization

Linear periodization allows you to focus your goals on different ranges on the hypertrophy spectrum during different “periods.” Here are two examples of a linear periodization schedule:

Weeks 1-4: 3x15 reps at 65% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 4x10 reps at 72% of your max  
Weeks 9-12: 5x5 reps at 85% of your max  

Weeks 1-4: 4x12 reps at 70% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 5x7 reps at 80% of your max  
Weeks 9-12 6x3 reps at 90% of your max  

In the end, a pyramid rep scheme, etc. that you should eventually utilize all the different rep ranges if you want to your training to be as optimal and effective as possible.

*****

### In conclusion 


*****

I really hope this information has been helpful to you

TL;DR - you may have to read it a couple times over, 3 reps is still going to cause some sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. for an relatively untrained individual all of the rep ranges are going to see a noticeable increase in size and strength.

Update!,catachip,1817,540,260,"About a year ago I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nhz3y/couples_transformation_soft_to_more_fit_in_a_year/) an update of the transformation my partner and I had gone through over the preceding year. I thought I would provide an update a year later and let you know how we're doing and what we've been doing.

First, at the start of a 28 mile hike/race. Ironically, the before pictures are from the first hike we ever went on together... aside from the ""Super Hike"", last summer we did the arduous but beautiful 75 km West Coast Trail in British Columbia - we've come a long way! We both started out sedentary and unfit, although my partner was admittedly worse off at baseline than me. The details of our initial transformation are in the post outlined above. 

In the year since my first post we've really been working on refining things with diet and exercise. We now both work out 6 days per week, cardio in evening). For weight lifting we do a four-day split (back-biceps, legs, chest-triceps, shoulders-abs) with dead lifts, squats, bench press

My partner James (without glasses) has made it a psychological goal to get to a ""healthy"" BMI range (regardless of the relevance of that number

For myself, and deadlifts. I've been on a cut through the spring, so numbers have declined a bit. I don't really have any 1RM to share, but in the winter I was around 3x8 at 225 for squats, bench was around 3x8 at 175, and DL I can recall a max of 3x5 at 300 lbs. Nothing to brag about at all, but I remember not being able to complete 3x5 at 65 lbs squat when I started, but I also enjoy having a robust aerobic capacity  - being able to go balls to the wall on the bike for 45 min or run 5-7 miles easily is important to me

As for nutrition, but around 1200 calories has had him losing weight and his maintenance is around 1800. I've actually been trying to increase fat in my diet recently. I had a lipid panel completed, and while my LDL and triglycerides were very very low, my HDL was far below the normal range. I've been trying to add more dietary cholesterol from eggs and more saturated fat from higher fat dairy and meat to my diet to try and help. It's also possible I have a genetic disposition to low HDL, so I'll be interested to see during a retest in 6 months.

I'd be happy to answer any specific questions. We appreciate the wonderful resource of this subreddit and have utilized the advice

**Edit #1:** Some have asked for it

The sets and rep range change over time

Day 1: Bench, machine triceps, machine flyes, push-ups to failure (3xF).

Day 2: Squats, calf raises, hamstring curl

Day 3: Deadlifts,3,4,1,2,3,4,2... For four cycles, lat pull down

Day 4: Overhead press (usually dumbbell), front raise, hanging leg raises.

I did not do most of SS due to learning about it in December and already having basic strength levels by then from HS wrestling and from lifting since August. I do highly recommend it to anyone starting lifting weights and I did some of the routines when first starting to workout my legs in January.

Also I haven't seen a progress post with tattoos but not sure if this has been addressed before but I have not seen any change in regards to stretching out or distortion of shape of my 4 tattoos. Only the bicep one looks different when I flex it and that is to be expected.

My next goals are to get to a lean 180lb/81kg and get the hard filled out look. I also want to hit the 1000lb club and get a bicep vein.

I am sharing my story with you today in hopes to inspire you or someone you know to challenge yourself. Now when most people hear the word “challenge” they immediately think of something negative. However when I hear the word “challenge” I right away think of opportunity. Ever since I was born I have faced challenges, I have worked with them to be in my favour. I have taken the wind that has blown on me, and adjusted my sail to determine where I want to go in life. This post is long, so bare with me. 
  
I was born in Sofia

At 2 ½ years old I was adopted by two amazing **Canadians**

I was born with a rare genetic disease called [Holt-Oram Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holt%E2%80%93Oram_syndrome). Basically **I was born with four fingers on each hand (no thumbs) and a hole in my heart.** It also effects your arm and shoulder development and range of motion is not great.  At three and four years old I had eight hour surgeries on both my hands to make me working thumbs. Then at age six I went in for open heart surgery to repair the hole in my right ventricle. My recovery road was long

When it was time to go to school it was bitter sweet. At first kids would make fun of me because I looked different. They called me things like four fingered freak or an alien. Then that gave me the idea for the perfect response when kids would ask me, I could have told myself I'm different and ugly and stupid but no I didn’t. My family did not raise me that way and I knew there must be good in this somewhere. That's when I realized, how I see the situation is all that really matters. At school I started to gain a lot of respect from my peers when I began accepting my differences as being *cool* and unique rather than weird. Being athletic and crushing physEd time also helped because then everyone wanted me on their team. So I made it through school, graduated with honours and became an Entrepreneur.
 
I ran my own painting franchise from age 18-23 (while attending University as a full time student) and became the first female in North America to produce $1 million dollars in residential painting in only 5 years. It was an amazing experience but because I started working so much I lost my focus regarding my health. It’s easy to do when life gets busy but I know how lucky I am to have been adopted and had these major surgeries done that I was not going to allow myself to let myself go or become unhealthy. That’s when I decided to take on another challenge! 

I decided I would train for a fitness competition for the first time. I had attended a show a year prior and I left wondering could I do what they did. How much discipline, and I ate clean, trained hard and practiced often. I started out at 141.2lbs and 20% body fat and by day 90 I was 124.6lbs and 12% body fat. Although I did not place in my first show, my trophy is my new body and the healthy habits I developed along the journey. I cannot wait to take the feedback from the judges and get back to practicing so I can compete again next summer and crush the stage! Another benefit of this challenge is that by going way outside my comfort zone and challenging myself, it has led to another wonderful potentially life changing opportunity... 

[before / after album of my fitness transformation](http://imgur.com/a/B3MfE)

This brings us to my reason for this long post. I entered a contest to be on the cover of a North American wide fitness magazine. I am in the top 50, they will go to Miami, Florida where the final judging will take place. I made a drastic physical transformation in 90 days and I overcame a lot of obstacles to get to where I am today. I truly think I have a good chance at winning IF I can get into the top 10 by Friday midnight. However, to do so at this point is mostly a popularity contest since pre-judging is based solely on votes.

I was a really active kid. I played soccer, and everything in between. I was looking forward to my first year of football when I started to limp home from every soccer practice. My parents brought me to the doctor and we find out I have something called leg calve perthes. It's a degenerative hip disease where the round hip bone loses its blood supply and essentially flattens out. 

So at 11 years old my options were to let the disease run its course and eventually get a hip replacement

After a year or so when I was finally off crutches my doctor told me I would never be able to play contact sports. No football, and became a shut in. I played video games all the time and rarely went out with friends. At my biggest I weighed around 250-260 lb. 

My life was never really unhappy or bad. I had girlfriends

But just loosing the weight wasn't enough. I want to be fit

My next move is to either start weight training in my off days or starting p90x once I have built up my cardio strength a bit more. I'm also looking into local 5k

Here is the difference after 2 months: http://i.imgur.com/xZOcXVz.jpg (slightly NSFW)

I'm not where I want to be yet but I'm VERY excited about the progress so far! Thank-you fittit for the constant support!

My weight training routine is something like this:

* Monday: Back/abs heavy
* Tuesday: Legs heavy
* Wednesday: bicep/tricep heavy
* Thursday: chest/ shoulders heavy
* Weekend: miscellaneous activities (swimming, yoga, etc.)

I also made some changes to my diet:

* started to drink enough water daily (and pee a lot more)
* cut out grain carbs (about 90%
* minimized dairy

Otherwise, the occasional potato or yam, poultry, and a TON of fish (mainly salmon) and eggs.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT 2: I'll take another shot later today in the same spot as the original photo with the same lighting

EDIT 3: I've been asked for a breakdown of my workout routine. It honestly varies a little, I don't know all the technical terms of everything)

**MONDAY**

* Leg raises (knees 90 degrees) 3 sets of 10
* 5 minute ab routine: 1 min regular plank, 2 min on back w/ legs 6 inches off ground (2-3 sets of this routine)
* Abdominal hip thrusts on gym bench
* Back extensions w/ 10 lb
* Row (60 lb)
* Lat pull-down (60 lb)
* TRX plank ab curnches, 5 right)

**TUESDAY**

* Squats (50lbs
* Walking lunges w/ 20 lb in each hand
* Hamstring curls (60 lb)
* Quad machine (don't know what it's called) (20 lb)
* TRX hip thrusts
* no deadlifts yet

**WEDNESDAY**

* Bicep curls 8lb (bottom half 10
* Standing overhead tricep extension (25lb)
* Assisted pull up (40 lb assistance)
* Assisted tricep dips (40 lb assistance)
* Back extensions w/ 10 lb weight
* Leg raises (knees at 90 degrees)
* Abdominal hip thrusts on gym bench

**THURSDAY**

* Shoulder Raises to side (8lb)
* Shoulder raises to front (8lb)
* Laying down dumb bell chest press parallel (20lb)
* Laying down dumb bell chest press perpendicular (20lb)
* Squats (50lb)
* Walking lunges w/ 20 lb in each hand

For cardio, depending on my mood). When I want to do more than 20 minutes of cardio, I either swim, get on my road bike, or use the elliptical because I broke my pelvis last year and can't handle impact for extended periods of time.

Hey guys, flyes, etc. Around the 3rd month I decided I needed to step up my game and invested in a proper set of weights and a lifting cage - I stopped doing cardio every day and reserved it more for those days which I wasn't lifting. The first few months I'm sure I overtrained; lifting daily with Saturday or sunday off when I wasn't too sore.

So, thanks to /fit which I leeched tons of helpful info from.


About Me and Stuff

Well, then started the (endless?) journey to aesthetics. Age 30. The scar on my stomach is from an operation I had as a child (called Pyloric Stenosis - essentially, stomach valve issue). 6'1. Live in Toronto ON area (any North York Goodlife people? Need someone to train with now that I'm up here...). Am a professional photographer for a living thus the cameras in many of the pics.


Supplements?

Protein whey - only when I can't get enough protein via regular foods or need something in a serious hurry.
Pre-W/O - Not anymore. Cold coffee is always in the fridge though
EC Stack - I'm a fan


What I've Learned

Well, this is what I wish I had known..

a) Weight fluctuates so wildly that weighing in more then once every 1-2 weeks will do more harm then good.


b) Essentially every celebrity, and especially in regards to fitness articles and websites, it was an essential part of how they looked (aside from image editing and of course hard work). Entirely frustrating looking at a '6 month' transformation and wondering why I didn't add 25lbs of lean mass like someone else did. The cop-out of 'well, person X just worked harder/was more dedicated then you' was a kick in the balls, especially with comments including ""..I didn't really watch my 
diet - I just ate clean everything and lifted heavy!"". Fuck you


c) It is very difficult to ever be completely satisfied, too fat. Cut down but still bigger, felt 'sloppy'. Right now I'm just trying to be happy - I am 200-205lbs and lightly visible abs, and as opposed to thinking 'i'm not shredded enough', I compare how I look @ 205lbs now to how I did years ago. (though I am on a cut now...hah! ..:\ ).


d) If you dedicate yourself to losing weight and getting in shape


e) I cannot do cheat days well



How Has Your Life Changed

Probably the most common non-training related question I get is this

Firstly, it is literally night and day difference. Attribute it to confidence gained due to the physique change, perhaps, but I am *not* an attractive looking guy and I find myself on the receiving end of attractive female attention more regularly. I am in a very happy and awesome relationship now, but if I wasn't, I have no doubt that I would do far better with girls now then I ever did in college (or any other time).

Secondly, I will make time to exercise. Of course exceptions such as special events, etc exist, but the longest I didn't train was 2 weeks during a trip to Seoul. It becomes a part of your life.

FInally, family life - 
everything has benefitted from training.  People are more easily influenced and talked to when someone stands tall/strong/fit; for example

An odd side note, blogs, you name it. My girlfriend got a call from one of her friends in Korea saying my pics were on a main post of Naver (Korean website; gf = Korean). I was actually recognized on two separate occasions on the street….the whole thing has been somewhat bizarre.  You'll notice an obnoxious watermark on some images because fitness pages have literally stolen them to promote their gyms, personal training, whatever. Jimmies rustled to see the pic get 15.6k Likes but my own page has 800 or so...but certainly ego-boosting.


Training

One thing that has not really changed much over this year has been the weight/amount I can lift. My 1RM on bench is still 255lbs or so and I don't know if that will ever change naturally; deadlift maxed out at 415lbs, have been stagnant for easily 6 months now, and I don't anticipate that changing. Interestingly, I'd since moved to the city and was using a crappy gym in the condo; 1 all-in-one machine and minimal free weights. This had forced me to train a lot less compounds then I'm used to (dumbbell presses for chest balanced on a yoga ball because there is no bench for example..) but a bunch of my other lifts have improved; dumbbell curls, leg presses, etc. I've been forced to do more reps (10-14) as opposed to heavier weights so I can really feel Ive got a good workout. I now, for the first time ever, and it's been awesome.


Currently I train 6 times a week usually, one legs, shoulders, arms/back, one 'other' misc day (I use a rowing machine a lot now on 'off' days)


Bulking - I tried a fairly controlled bulk from around...Oct or so, it'll be leangains only unless I ever use gear because - though I felt stronger - carrying around this extra bulk only to have to lose it again for, maybe, 1-3lbs gain? Just not worth it to me.
I estimate my maintenance to be approximately 2500 calories; cutting at 2k. Regarding diet (especially cutting)


Finally, selling, or am being endorsed/sponsored by, just trying to be helpful with information where I can. I truly feel being in good shape has been a giant positive change in my life, and if I can help anyone else do the same, I'm glad to do so; though as I'm not using it for income, sometimes updates can lag.


Also, because my intentions for this post and the end result are not the same.


**hold on


Are you fat? Kind of fat? Lazy? Whatever? Stop eating so much. Find out how much you need to eat (in calories, it makes your life inconvenient, and people will think you are retarded for putting your peanut butter on a scale before onto your bread. If you want to continue to be fat and out of shape, continue to care what they think, but there's a reason why being in shape is an exception and not the rule. Also, start exercising, preferrably with weights but start with whatever you have. There is tons of exercise routines online, you will see results. 5x5 or madcow or whatever, 100% dedication
I didn't start lifting weights because I didn't like my stigmas I associated with 'those types' of people...I didn't want to be a 'muscle head', I didn't want to feel inadequate, I didn't want to fail, or look weak, or be made fun of for trying...but I also couldn't live with who I was any longer. The sooner you stop giving a damn about what other people think and get to work, however, the better. Oh how much I wished I'd lived this lifestyle earlier...start now.

-----------------------

I moved out and lived with an awesome roommate. I was around 280 lbs. We went splits on pizza every two or three days. I just looked up the pizza calories on the dominos website and calculated accordingly.  
  
One large 14"" pizza with sausages, with 370 calories per slice. Since I am 6'4 and 280 lbs, I calculated my BMR to be 2630 calories using [this](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/) calculator. For a week I ate one of these large pizzas per day which came out to $33.99 total for 3 large 3 topping pizzas, so around $14 a day, Dominos was around the corner from my apartment so it wasn't much for a days worth of food. I was gaining 2lbs a week from 1pizza/day, so I cut it in 3/4ths. Eating 6 slices/day had me at maintenance over a two week period, so I went down to 4 slices a day which cost me $8/day @ 1480 calories.
  
I did SS 3x a week along with running every other day and doing accessory lifts on Sundays. On weekends I ate loads of fruit and usually cooked myself a steak, chicken totaling 3000+ calories/day as my ""cheat"" meal. During weekdays I did 3 pizza slices/day, and a half liter of chocolate milk post workout. 1 slice sounds like little but these were big slices with loads on them. 
  
I essentially did IF. I ate from 2pm (when my classes end) until 8pm creating an 18 hour fast.    
  
This diet was also amazing because I started smoking weed in university so it worked out from every angle
  
**tldr; In a little under 3 months I lost 65 LBS eating mainly pizza and chocolate milk while doing SS and running. I also felt like shit during the week.**

1368384977.0,1e72y5,Re-activating and strengthening the gluteal muscles,BramSwinnen,1477,314,142,"Introduction

The gluteus maximus is the strongest and biggest muscle of the body. The gluteus maximus is not only a hip extensor but also plays an important role in pelvic and spinal stabilisation and proper leg alignment (Snijders et al. 1993). 
The gluteus maximus allows us to maintain an upright position needed for bipedalism. Through evolution the gluteus maximus enlarged in humans as a means to stabilise the trunk while standing and counteract the high impact forces that tend to flex the trunk anteriorly during running and sprinting. Consequently the glute muscles gradually lose tone during our chair-laden lifestyle (Marzke et al. 1988). The terms ‘gluteal amnesia’ and ‘sleeping giant’ probably sound familiar.  These terms refer to inhibition and delayed activation of the gluteal muscles
Due to our lifestyle
What is the last time your glutes felt really sore after a workout? Many athletes and lifters don’t know how to turn on the glutes
This article focuses on exercises that address the major functions of the glutes and result in the greatest level of glute activation. These exercises will help to switch your glutes back on and re-establish correct muscle recruitment patterns. Re-activating your glutes will positively affect every compound lower body lift
     
    
The gluteus maximus and lower back stability

Activating and strengthening the glutes needs to form an important part of your core routine.
Co-contraction of the gluteus maximus with the psoas major (part of iliopsoas muscle) contributes to lumbo-sacral stabilization (Gibbons 2005). The gluteus maximus provides stability to the sacroiliac joint (SI joint) by bracing and compression (Snijders et al. 1993). Excess movement at the SI joint would compromise the L5-S1 intervertebral joints and disc and could lead to SI joint dysfunction and low back pain.
The gluteus maximus also provides lower back stability through its connection with the erector spinae and toraco-lumbar fascia (Vleeming et al. 1995). Some of its fibres are continuous with the fibres of the erector spinae. A contraction of the gluteus maximus will generate tension in the erector spinae muscle on the same side
Gluteus maximus contraction also exerts a pull on the lower end of the thoraco-lumbar fascia
People with low back pain often have weak and deconditioned glutes (Kankaanpää et al. 1998). Lengthened gluteal muscles as a result of our sitting lifestyle leads to a decreased stabilising function in the gluteus maximus (Richardson et al. 1991). This can result in compensation by the lower back and more altered muscular firing patterns and function.     
     
    
Inhibition of the gluteal muscles   


Low back pain has been associated with inhibition of the gluteus maximus (Leinonen et al. 2000). The activation of the gluteus maximus during hip extension is delayed in people with a history of low back pain compared to people with no back pain. In people with low back pain hip extension is initiated by the hamstrings and erector spinae instead of the gluteus maximus (Nelson-Wong et al. 2012). Even after the episode of low back pain has resolved
People suffering from ankle sprain injuries also have been shown to have reduced activation levels of the gluteus maximus (Bullock-Saxton et al. 1994).
In the case of low back pain
     
     
Weak or inhibited gluteal muscles contribute to injury

Weak or delayed activation of the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius is a root cause for many injuries and chronic pain:   
   
- Hamstring strains:  Due to delayed gluteus maximus activity, ""Any time you see an injured muscle, look for a weak synergist.” A synergist is a muscle that performs the same joint motion.   
- Low back pain: Gluteus maximus activation plays an important role in stabilising the pelvis during the task of lifting (Noe et al. 1992). Delayed gluteus maximus activation also causes excessive compensation of the back extensors (Nelson-Wong et al. 2012).   
- Anterior knee pain: The excessive internal rotation of the femur as a result of glute weakness increases the pressure on the patellar cartilage (Tyler et al. 2006).   
- Anterior hip pain: Decreased force production from the gluteus maximus during hip extension is associated with increased anterior translation of the femur in the acetabulum. The increased femoral anterior glide could lead to increased force and wear and tear on the anterior hip joint structures (Cara et al. 2007)   
- Lower-body malalignment: Weak glutes results in increased internal rotation of the femur
- Gluteal weakness also has been associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprains (Hewett et al. 2006)
      
     
Exercises to re-activate the gluteal muscles

The gluteus maximus is especially active during stair climbing, together with a control of the stance leg in the frontal (preventing adduction of the thigh) and transverse plane (preventing internal rotation of the thigh), which results in a high neural drive to the gluteus maximus, medius and other muscles of the lateral system.   
   
[Resisted slide-board back lunge](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/resisted-slide-board-back-lunge):   
   
- the cable creates a hip flexion force against which the gluteus maximus has to stabilise    
- The movement mimics the hip action of running and stair climbing. Like in running
- Single-leg stance
-	Advanced progression: Combining this exercise with a shoulder press emphasizes the stabilising role of the gluteus maximus even more.

[Single-leg squat](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-box-squat) and [single-leg Romanian deadlift](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-romanian-deadlift):   
   
- These single-leg exercises require concentric or eccentric hip extension throughout a large range of motion.

[Single-leg squat &amp; pull](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-squat-pull) and [single-leg Romanian deadlift &amp; pull](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-romanian-deadlift-pull):   
   
- In these exercises the hand opposite to the stance leg is loaded. The added rotary force stimulates the external rotator capability of the gluteus maximus and medius and gives these exercises a multi-planar character. The glutes need to stabilise the hip in the frontal (resisting gravity’s hip adduction torque) and transverse plane (preventing internal rotation of the thigh) and generate movement in the sagittal plane (concentric/eccentric hip extension).    
- These exercises train the cross-body connection ([posterior oblique system]( http://functionalresistancetraining.com/articles/inner-and-outer-unit)), into the opposite lattisimus dorsi.

[Superband X walk](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/superband-x-walk):    
    
- This exercise combines hip extension and hip abduction and requires stabilization of the trunk against flexion
- This exercises also trains the cross-body connection.

[Side bridge with abuction](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/side-bridge-with-abduction):   
   
- High activation levels of the gluteus medius

[The slide-board lateral slide](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/slide-board-lateral-slide):    
    
- This exercise combines a powerful hip extension and abduction and really activates the gluteus maximus

Edit: Thanks guys for the positive comments and I see some good discussions on which I want to comment here.     
Some interpret this post as OR squats OR some of the exercises listed here. But it’s an AND, a great exercise to create an overload of the lower body musculature.    
Squats are knee-dominant and when you combine them with a hip-dominant exercise you maintain an optimal balance between glute
   
I’ll give a few examples of squats combined with the exercises listed above.    
    
Workout 1:    
Bulgarian split squat:       
   

- 1 x 6 reps@ (bodyweight) (@ means each leg).  
- 1 x 6 reps@ (60% 1RM)   
- 2 x 5 reps@ (70% 1RM)   
- 2 x 3 reps@ (80% 1RM)    
    
Front or back squat (full ROM):   
  
- 4 x 4 reps (80% 1RM)   
   
Single-leg Romanian deadlift &amp; row:   
   
- 1 x 8 reps@ (60% 1RM)   
- 3 x 6 reps@ (70% 1RM)   
   
Workout 2:    
  
Side bridge with abduction: great for neural activation of the glutes at the start of the workout.  
   
- 3 x 6-8 reps@   
   
Front or back squat (full ROM):    
   
- 1 x 6 reps (60% 1RM)   
- 3 x 6 reps (70% 1RM)    
   
Slide-board resisted back lunge: You don’t need a slide-board
   
- 4 x 8RM @

I found /r/loseit and /r/fitness and basically got started from there. (Seriously

First the Pictures:

[Before

[After

I went from 215 to roughly 178

My big three lifts (have herniated my spine twice) 

Bench: ~225 to 325
Deadlifts: ~135 to 365
Squats: ~95 to 275

My Summer routine consisted of:

Monday: 5K run

Tuesday: Back + Biceps
- Deadlifts
- Pullups/Assisted Pullups
- Bent over Rows
- Dumb bell rows
- Hammer Curls
- Preacher Curls
- Ab rollers

Wednesday: 5K run 

Thursday: Chest + Triceps
- Flat barbell bench
- Inclined dumb bell bench
- Dips/Assisted Dips
- Cable crosses
- Tricep pull downs
- Weighted Ab pull downs

Friday: 5K run

Saturday: Rest day

Sunday: Legs + Shoulders
- Squats
- Leg Extensions
- Leg Curls 
- Calf Raises
- OHP
- Clean + Jerk 
- Shrugs
- Sitting Dumbbell Raises
- Ab rollers

Now that it's winter

My next steps are to cut down to ~10% BF at 170, human flag, and to dunk. Oh how I'm looking forward to dunking a basketball. 

**EDIT** Many people were asking about my Bench numbers because it seemed unbelievable

""My original 1RM on the Bench was 325+ a couple years ago
I kept most of my LBM during my cut (It was a very clean protein heavy cut)
Wasn't too much programming

**EDIT v2** Many people are also asking about examples of diet. 

I was extremely strict with my diet in the first month; a typical day was:

Breakfast: 1 cup of Kashi grain cereal (~70 calories)

Lunch: 1 chicken breast seasoned with montreal steak spice + srirarcha and handful of arugula and baby spinach

Mid Afternoon: 2 scoops of protein shake with cold water

Dinner: 10 oz steak with 3 eggs

I'd average ~8-10 cups of water a day.

However, especially in an Asian household wouldn't last. I slowly regressed to eating whatever my mom made (generally pretty healthy) while cutting off the rice. I'd make rough estimations on how much calories each dish was, and in my mind proportion them accordingly. Luckily, my parents were very understanding and didn't give me too much shit for not eating rice. I cook my own food at lunch when I'm at work (also saves a lot of money from going out to buy).

Slowly

If I'm really craving something (i.e. Fries) I learned a littly trick from /r/loseit, then top it off with a couple more fries. Got my fix, tricked my body into thinking I ate a lot of fries, and caloric damage was negligible. 

**EDIT V3**

Hey, I'm happy.

I'll also try to post a video of my bench the next time I go for a 1RM to quell all doubts.

*Edit to add diet and exercise

As for diet, and the alike.  I've tried many diet plans along the way and by far the best is the one I am doing now.  

The rules for my current diet are:

Eat slightly under TDEE

No processed food

Limit sodium to under 2000mg

Limit sugars to under 25g 

Really try to stick to as natural food as possible

Exercise:

The bulk of my weight came off with running 5-6 days a week or more.

I tried to run/jog 2 miles a day (of course I walked a lot of it until I was able to run it).

For a few months I ran 2 miles twice a day.

Currently I lift 5-6 days a week and try to run a mile after lifting.

In all honesty

My routine is pretty straightforward: I go to the gym 3 times a week. Each session I do deadlift or squat; bench or OHP; and dips or pull-ups (I alternate between each of these pairs). When I can do five sets of five reps at a given weight, mostly tricep stuff.

My numbers:

 - Age 26

 - Deadlift: started at 5x5 @ 75lb

 - Squat: 5x5 @ 15-lb barbells; now at 5x5 @ 85.  Took me *ages* to get my form down right

 - Bench: 5x5 from 45 to 75

 - OHP: 5x5@35 to 5x3 @ 55.  I've been stuck at 55 for a while - but it helped to switch around my routine so that I'm not doing it right after I deadlift

 - Dips: 5x5 from 61 lbs of assistance to 16

 - Pull-ups: 5x5 from 70 lbs of assistance to 28

Challenges: My biggest one is sleep. I work from home so it's really tough for me to maintain a normal work/sleep schedule

I had always thought I had a pretty healthy diet and a good relationship with food, my first reaction wouldn't be ""Montereyo, you idiot""; it would be, ""Gee, good for you!""  I'm definitely getting better, though - I make myself eat breakfast *every* morning, even though I'm not usually hungry until later. I also load up on protein.  I love cottage cheese

1372172057.0,1h1g9u,My progress in the last 1.5 years,T-roy9444,1525,380,161,"A year and half ago I looked at myself in the mirror and was disgusted at what I had become. I was always a fatter kid in highschool (weighted 220lbs my senior year) but after college I had completely let myself go and tipped the scale at 282lbs. 

I called up a friend and we started P90x together the next week. 
This is where I started: [Pic](http://imgur.com/NgjU9)
I was so embarrassed to take this picture but now I'm glad I did. 

Over the next year I cut (stayed around 2000 calories a day a kept my protein around 1g/lb and did some variation of P90x and these were my [results](http://imgur.com/CUpjH) [bonus](http://imgur.com/L3zvFFd) from January. 

In September last year I also ran my first 5k in 24:17 and actually placed 3rd in my age group. I ran the first mile without stopping (very slowly) in June of last year.

At the end my P90x journey I had lost 100 lb and weighed 182lbs and was very happy with my progress but I wasn't finished.

At the end of January me and some friends got hired as coaches for our High School football team and I was tasked with strength and conditioning. 

The program I came up with was:

Mondays:

Squat (3x5)

Deadlift (1x5)

Bench (3x5)

Decline Bench (2x12-15)


Wednesday

DB Lunges (3x8)

OHP (3x5)

Pullups (3xMax)

Power Cleans (3x6)


Friday

Squat (3x5)

Incline Bench (3x5)

Bent Over Rowa (3x5)

Dips (3x8 weighted)

I followed this proram myself to prove to the kids it would work but I was also training for a half marathon in March, back up to 205lbs. I stayed around 3000 calories a day. Weekends became a free-for-all of eating all the terrible things I hadn't had in a year.

 Once I cut back on running my strength shot up. I never really maxed anything but by the end of May my lifts were:

Bench (245x5)

High bar squat (295x5)

Deadlift (345x5)

OHP (70lb DBx5) I have some shoulder issues and DB's seems to work better for me.

I'm aware my bench is higher compared to my other lifts but I was a bench bro in HS and college. It's by far my favorite exercise.

Here's a [pic](http://imgur.com/Tc1qiSA) from the beginning of my cut.

We switched to a 4 day split when we started summer conditioning. 

Monday - Shoulders and Triceps	
	
OHP	(3x5)

Dumbbell Lateral Raise (4X12,6)

Dumbbell Reverse Fly (4X12,6)

Dumbbell Shrugs (4X12,6)

Clean and Press	(3x6)

Yesterday was a month into the cut [this](http://imgur.com/SCg00JR) is where I'm at (197lbs) with around  7-10lbs I'd still like to lose.

1356923279.0,15pdab,Gym advice for people with new year's resolution to get in better shape,taylor13002,1527,401,580,"First of all

* always re-rack the weights/bars/dumbbells you use
* try not to occupy something you are using in between sets if you do not have to.  This mostly applies to dumbbells and adjustable benches.  Re-rack the dumbbell or don't sit on the bench incase someone else wants to use it.  This does not apply as much for squat racks or fixed benches though (basically anything you use barbells for)
* if you are not sure if something is being used, wait or ask to work in with them.  Most people are very friendly in the gym.  
* The squat rack is not to be used for bicep curls.  Please, but much less for squatting.  

That's pretty much it for gym etiquette.  Following these makes everyone's workout a little smoother.  

As for actual exercise advice

* eat a good snack before
* get a good warm up
* perform exercises with correct form, no one really cares about what you look like or what you lift in the gym.  Proper form will make the exercises more effective and greatly reduce the chance of injury
* free weights (dumbbells
* stay away from the smith machine
* drink water and breath during your workout
* big/compound lifts like squat, and military press are best and most effective, and should be done first in your workout
* get in the habit of squatting and deadlifting. they are not as much fun at first but they are great for you (form is extremely important though).
* most importantly

I suggest reading Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe

Feel free to correct me on anything or add anything I may have missed.


Additions from everyone:

* keep a log of everything you do.  write down your workouts and how many sets and reps you do.  also take pictures and measurements of yourself every month to track your progress.

* have reasonable expectations of where you are trying to get.  changing your body takes time and wont happen in a week or a month.  keep exercising and going to the gym and over time you will see change.  getting in shape will happen gradually

* some people pointed out that you should not try to finish your exercise quicker if people are waiting, which is correct.  do not risk your form or health for anyone else.  if people are waiting and you can shorten your rest periods in between sets, then give it a shot, but otherwise, dont worry, take your time and work out smartly and correctly.

* i feel like i did not emphasize how important it is to have correct form when lifting, read articles in books or online, and post form checks to r/fitness.  lifting properly is so much easier and effective.

* listen to what your body is telling you when you are exercising.  if you need to rest

* find a gym that you like, franchises like powerhouse and planet fitness because they feel more personal and like they are mine, but thats just my preference.  Find the gym that works for you.

I went from the photo on the left to the photo on the right in a span of two years.  It took a whole lifestyle change, tears and dedication to get to where I am now.  Being called fat by people SUCKED, especially since I grew up thin, was thin in high school and only had gained the weight while in a tumultuous relationship after high school.  I wasn't used to it.  It was terrible.

I posted the below information in a comment on another redditor's post.  He had inquired about what motivators could enable him to keep on working out. I just decided to tell a little story about how I got to where I am now and what kept me going:

My transformation came in stages

I ended up losing 36 lbs this way around the end of the summer of 2011. I was also a vegetarian (although my eating choices still weren't the most informed as I was eating a lot of frozen vegetarian dishes). I started eating meat around October and then I then started to make some really smart food choices and actually researching nutrition.

I joined Crossfit in January of 2011 at 150 lbs and in 2 months I went down to 135 lbs. Crossfit is pretty expensive but I got the knowledge on proper form

I decided to start lifting at another gym with my boyfriend and that is where I am currently at. So far I have lost another 3 lbs this month.  I can now do three consecutive pullups. I like to flex my muscles in the mirror and I check myself out. I love it when my clothes get smaller but I get STRONGER. I also had a girl e-mail me telling me I was her inspiration and she has lost 30 lbs already. I started crying. I came a fucking LONG WAY from where I used to be and I am still stunned about my entire transformation and even more stunned someone is using my transformation as their motivation.

I'm sorry if there's a specific subreddit for this - if there is please direct me to it and I will post it there instead. I feel like if I put this here, not feel intimidated and start reading Starting Strength.  All it takes is a goal and a desire to be fit! 

**TL;DR - I lost 54 lbs in two years

I work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a ""bar"" where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements. I normally just bring my own

We slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order

Now I have been working out at this gym for a few months, and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable. I'm not saying he doesn't use them for sure, but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated, I am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work.

She finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins. The employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably very important phone call. That's when I catch it
If you don't know much about fitness supplements, but probably ~400 calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been. Judging by how small this woman was, those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get, but not too much to gain much extra weight...

[My after](http://imgur.com/tcWJm)

Like the title says, and completely uncoordinated.   I was never heavy but I think the proper word to use would be chubby.  I got married, got a great job, had kids, and settled into to a very comfortable life.  Most of my evenings were spent quietly with my family, and weekends were beer and video games.  My weight went from the chubby 5’9” 180 to right over 200.  Pants went from 36” to a tight 40”.  Still, I didn’t pay much attention.  [Until the picture.](http://imgur.com/f4jaw)  My wife sent this very photo to all our friends and relatives for his first birthday announcement, “My chubby babies.”  Nobody was rude, I just couldn’t believe it.  I realized that if I didn’t change soon

So screw it.  I got a membership at the local mega gym.  My regimen was very simple:  three days a week, cable rows and lat pull downs.  Wednesday was shoulders and arms, dumbbell presses, barbell curls, and triceip pulldowns.  Friday was legs with squats and deadlifts.  I would aim for 3x5 for the bigger muscle groups and 3x8 for the smaller.  If I could do more reps than last time, I’d increase the weight by as small as possible.  My numbers never were impressive, nor are they now, pressing 25s

I downloaded MyFitness Pal and logged 1500 calories a day.  I did this RELIGIOUSLY.  I made a game out of seeing if I could eat like a caveman (later I found out it was kind Paleo diet-esque).  The simpler the food, or beef and broccoli, ham and split pea soup.  Then I’d divide it by 5, put it in Tupperware, and take them for lunch.  Before I went to bed, I’d set up oatmeal in the microwave.  Just come downstairs and hit start, pee, as much I wanted, I promised myself I’d eat only after I still wanted food after I chugged a big glass of water and sipped a glass of tea/coffee.  Nine times out of ten I’d be okay.  

Things I learned.  
**FOOD.**  FOOD was the key.  Being able to control myself was by far the hardest thing.  I had to learn stop eating for pleasure or fun, what I was eating.  To do this, I would look at the food, think, count to five, and then eat.   Some things I couldn’t have in the house.  Chips, cookies

**Just pick a program and START!**  I researched for maybe a month on programs, far from it.  In fact, I’m sure it’s lousy.  But I needed a starting point.   

**Max effort, then it wouldn’t be my fault.  I could then honestly say, “I tried as hard as I could, and it didn’t work.  I was too old, my body couldn’t change.""   So every rep was to failure and I was drenched in sweat after my treadmill, panting.  But it was only three hours a week.  

It took me about six months, but now I know exactly what 1500 calories look like and am much more conscious about what I put into my body.  But the biggest change, strangely enough…people look at me differently, treat me differently.  It is very hard for me to describe, and I’ve read of other people who have lost weight have experienced this as well.  People take me more seriously, I think?  When I talk to people, they look me in the eye and seem to listen more carefully to what I say than before.  

But more importantly, Thor’s shoulders.  I’m still me.  I still have the same insecurities, the same fears, the same worries that I have always had.  Getting in shape made me feel more confident, sure, but not to the point where I’m some rugged alpha male getting in bar fights.  I’m not smarter.  I didn’t get a promotion or a new job and I still drive an older Honda.  My friends and family don’t love me any more than they did before.  But I am happier.  

Last words.  I am nothing special.  I am not a superhero.  I am an average

Thanks for the front page love yo.

The first 70 was pretty easy. Started at 270 and right now floating between 195 and 200. The holidays were rough food wise but I am getting back on track. I've had nagging aches and pains for about a decade that started going away with the first 30.

Edit:
A little misunderstanding on part. I do want to contribute.

At 270, and all sodas/ sugary drinks. Just water and coffee. I tried to keep my calories under 1800 and my exercising was only walking 3 times a week for about a mile at a time. 

At 250, but not bad either.  If you want to do it, it's awesome, there is a great app for a smartphone too, but for the love of all you hold dear, get you some good shoes and learn how to run properly so you don't hurt yourself going in. I tried C25K years ago and quit after a few weeks because of shin splints. I bought shoes to cushion my fat ass stomping and learned how to improve my stride and all good.

As far as gym work, deadlifts, rows, and squats (never all together). Sometimes I will add a day of arms or legs, but I have very specific fitness goals and I am trying to stick to that program. Weights are only done twice a week, but pushups and situps are done 3 to 5 days a week.

I was sidelined from Nov - Mid-Dec for a minor pec strain/tear and it through everything off and then Thanksgiving and Christmas are rough because I love all that food! 

I honestly think the best thing I did for myself was really upping my water intake. I drink nearly a gallon a day and I can tell when I don't.

Now, we never fight, we make each other laugh, more or less we're a bit over a year in and I really hope we spend the rest of our life together.

Now the bad news. About 3 months ago I FINALLY got really serious about my body. I want to be as strong, use creatine, follow a strict work-out plan and already I'm seeing great results. However, last week my girlfriend was cuddling up to me while we were watching a move and she put her hand on my chest...and made a kind of weird noise. I was like ""that was strange"" The next day she asked me ""Why do you work out so much?"" I told her I want to be the best I can be. She sighed and said ""But you're so nice right now...""

http://imgur.com/KAoQhEa   

I have been meaning to post this for a while so results photos are a few months old but still accurate. I started my fitness journey in the summer of 2006 right after an extremely unhealthy freshman year in which I gained the freshman 15 each semester. This was mainly due to taking the all you can eat buffet at my dorm cafeteria as a challenge every night and my discovering of alcohol late into my second semester.  


**2006**  

Early Fall ~215lb http://imgur.com/EgMavlt Late Fall ~210lb http://imgur.com/54oVqkl  
My wake up call came when I came back home that summer and weighed in at 238 lbs which for my 6'1"" height makes a BMI of 31 which is considered obese. Also when getting my blood pressure checked it was 130/90 which is pre-hypertensive. These two revelations along with loving teasing from family and friends gave me the motivation to start an intensive workout plan. The routine I did for the next ~2 months was pretty simple as I did not know much about exercise at that point. I would run to the gym (1 mile away) and do 3 sets on 10 machines doing 5 minutes on the recumbent bike in between each machine then I would run back home. This got me down into the 215-220 lb range by the time I went back for my sophomore year of college. Being home had helped my nutrition as well as having noone to drink with in town but I was concerned about what would happen eating at the cafeteria again so I combated this by only eating breakfast there which consisted of scrambled eggs, and skim milk. For lunch I just had sandwiches with potato chips and for dinner used my meal plan to either go to the campus chick-fil-a or the campus burger place. Definitely not the healthiest food options but made it easier to have a consistent amount of calories per day (though I had no idea of how to count calories at the time). That fall semester I started researching more about exercise and started taking a lot of supplements including a workout multivitamin (contained way more than I needed), a BSN stack of Cellmass, Nitrix, and NO-Xplode, as well as ON's whey protein (paid for by donating plasma 2x a week). I got down to 206 lb during that semester and that is the lowest I would weigh for almost 4 years though I was slowly increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat.  


**2007**  

Stayed in the 210-220 range not much changed. Dealt with some personal issues towards the end of the year and stopped going to classes.
  

**2008**  

Spring ~220 lb http://imgur.com/HOsPYhj  
 
In the spring I changed my major to Kinesiology, and nutrition was able to start making a lot more healthy choices though still partied 1-3 nights a week so didn't see too much of an improvement in weight though continued to get stronger. Stayed closer to 220 in this time.  


**2009**  

http://imgur.com/X5T3a7Y  

Did the P90 program over the summer (predecessor to P90X). Stayed in the 210 range.  
  

**2010**  

2 year relationship ended mid spring and drank/partied a little too much the rest of the semester but got back into things during the summer.  Did insanity for the first time and helped shave off about 5 lbs. Highest weight: 195

Did the first month of P90X2 but then switched to the M.A.S.S. program from MuscleMag during the spring. Summer moved to a new town to get ready for grad school in the fall. Started running 3 miles 5x a week, Fri or a few hundred calories under but Tues, Thurs, Sat I would be 1000-1500 calories under maintenance. I was eating 2500-3000 calories/day but towards the end I was doing 3 5-6 mile runs a week, swimming 1 mile a week, doing strength training 3x/week, and biking 30-40 miles 2-3x a week in addition to the 3 mile rides to and from campus. Did a few months of the Stronglifts program in the fall, 1 ""push"" workout and 1 ""pull"" workout program towards the end of the year due to my increased load from triathlon training. Nutrition pretty similar to what I'll describe as my current diet in 2013. Highest weight: 193


**2013**  

http://imgur.com/KAoQhEa http://imgur.com/9puChUu  

Suffered a partial Achilles tendon rupture at the end of Jan that would set me back all spring. Yes this was probably due to overtraining and undernourishment in the previous semester but I had been eating at maintenance all of January (average 4000 calories/day) so I dunno. The injury was 2 days after my first 60 mile bike ride attempt on my first 7.5 mile run so that was probably more the cause than anything. During the spring did a modified version of Beachbody's Body Beast program at the gym, 7% body fat.
  
  
Nutrition:  
Goal is to have low sodium ~2000 mg
  
  
Fiber was actually getting too high especially on high calorie days so I've substituted the 100% whole wheat pasta I had almost every day with brown rice or enriched pasta and Honey wheat bread instead of 100% whole wheat on sandwiches.  
  
  
Low Calorie Breakfast:  

* Scrambled eggs with fat free cheese (1 whole

* Oats w/blueberries and ground flax seed  

* glass of Skim Milk  
  
  
High Calorie Breakfast:  

* Scrambled eggs with fat free cheese (1-2 whole

* Homemade pancakes with blueberries and dark chocolate chips ~425 calories  

* Honey  

* glass of Skim milk  
  
  
Snacks throughout the day:  

* Banana  

* Almonds  

* Yogurt (mixed with oats if didn't have for breakfast)  

* Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly sandwich (if need extra calories)  

* Whey protein post workout w/creatine  
  
  
Lunch:  

* V8 Low Sodium  

* 1 apple  

* Fish oil capsules  

* Sweet potato/potato mix that I bake in olive oil  

* Some fat free cheese sprinkled on if i need more calories/sodium that day  

* Extra lean beef or nearly fat free turkey breast cutlets  
  
  
Low cal Lunch/rest day:  

* V8 Low Sodium  

* 1 apple  

* Fish oil capsules  

* Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly sandwich or microwave pizza
  
  
Dinner 1:

* Chicken Breast tenderloin (grilled)  

* Brown Rice  

* Green Peas  
  
  
Dinner 2:  

* Pasta  

* Prego  

* Extra lean beef  

* Corn  
  
  
Dinner 3:  

* Tuna (low sodium)  

* Brown Rice  

* Broccoli  
  
  
The main point I wanted to make is to not put so much pressure on yourself to make huge drastic changes in a short period of time. Not everyone can lose 50-100+ lbs in a year nor should you. Just making small healthy changes to your diet and lifestyle will help you slowly lose the weight and when you get to your goal you will find it a lot easier to stay there because you will be accustomed to that level of intake/exercise. If there is anything else you would like to know just ask! 
  
*edit:* Fitocracy profile

*edit2:* A lot of people have commented/asked about the differences between 2006-2011 and 2011 onward. The main difference besides have a lot more time and less social life is my goal setting skills. If you take one thing away from this post its that one of the best keys to success like I have had is actually setting small realistic measureable goals. So for example I want to lose/gain/lift this much by this time and to get there I want to have done this much by this time and so forth. Not as I was pre-2011 ""I just want to lose weight or be in better shape""
  
*edit 3:* Something that I feel really helped me maintain muscle mass while losing weight is my pre and post workout nutrition. For example I would have a meal

*edit 4:* A lot of people have expressed appreciation for the nutrition info I included

**MY JOURNEY**

**Cookie Cutter days**

I started off my first 8-10 weeks hiring this infamous guy named Omar Ventura, 8 oz carbs, 6 oz veggies"" x times a day, choose your meat/carbs. 

The vagueness of his meal plans forced me to learn how to cook creatively etc. and helped me to find a good rhythm and establish good habits with my lifts - this was no credit to him

There was a falling out w/ him and his clients on IG and we peacefully departed because we didn't want to be associated with all of that... ANYWAY.

With that approach

Some highlights of the approach:

* carb cycling three days, 75g... ridiculously low
* calories were at around 2400
* protein was upwards of 350g!!!
* fats were as low was 40g a day -_- ... let's just say I had trouble getting *it* up
* lift 5x a week
* after 10 weeks

After the falling out

* cardio was WAY too much
* protein was WAY too high
* fats WAY too low
* I looked flat most of the time
* based on the knowledge I had

After the ""falling out"", given the information and experience we knew.

**IIFYM days (possibly forever)**

I slowly switched from that crazy macro ratio I had. For the first week

* went from PCF: 350g+ / 100g / 50g towards...
* PCF: 190-200g / 250g / 75g (roughly around 2400 - 2600 calories

After making that switch and throwing out carb cycling

As much as I want to trash the cookie cutter plan I was on

**Exercise**


My exercise more or less stayed the same; under the cookie cutter plan

* lifted in the 3-6 rep range for major lifts (squats, deadlifts, pullups, rows)
* reduced cardio down from the ridiculous 2xday/5 days to THREE. That's right, and I'm not in the gym the whole damn time. It was already a red flag for me when I saw the cardio at 2xday... glad I'm not doing that anymore as it's unnecessary and damaging to your metabolism and gains. In any case, I go on that pump-stepper, warm up at level 3 for 5 minutes, then do 30 seconds on level 12 / 30 seconds level 1 for 15 minutes. Then the remaining 10 minutes, I stroll at level 5. 

Workout split:

* Monday - chest and tris. DB bench, cable cross overs, tricep pulldowns
* Tuesday - back. Pullups, DB rows, DB curls
* Wednesday - legs. Squat, leg curls, leg ext
* Thursday - shoulders. BB OHP, shrugs, etc.
* Friday - back again (more volume
* Saturday - gun day. I'll do high volume pump sets to get my shoulders, play some basketball, and enjoy the weekend. 



**Some tips I have for new IIFYM**

* your habits play a huge part in what you end up becoming
* start off with ""clean eating"" i.e. whole foods to fit your macros for like a week or so... build discipline
* just because a ""carb"" is a ""carb"" under IIFYM
* I don't do Intermittent Fasting
* I know that I'm ALWAYS hungrier at night. I leave about 30% of my carb intake for bedtime so I can have things like Skinny Cows and Slow Churned ice cream. It gives me something to look forward to
* identify your ""trigger foods"" and stay the F away from them. I personally have a difficult time stopping when I start eating kettle corn... it's like

**Some other notes**

* goes without saying
* leave a meal every week where you just ""eye ball"" the macros -- this isn't a cheat
* use MFP and IIFYM calculator... best tools I've seen so far
* WRITE DOWN YOUR LIFT NUMBERS and try to beat them every week in reps or in weight. It makes lifting so much for fun
* DO YOU, and they get completely COMPLACENT!!! Know yourself... Do you, boo boo.

**EDIT:** formatting. PS

**EDIT 2:**

Thought I'd provide a bit more information:

* I've taken that body fat test a total of four times now; each time I get dunked in multiple times and the numbers are averaged out. I understand I don't look like the typical 8%, along with calipers (which seem to be within =/-.5 of whatever my dunk test showed).
* No one commented on the graph
* I upped my strength
* I LOST muscle from April until now (3 lbs
* Goes without saying: I did NOT gain muscle and lose fat simultaneously.
* No dammit I'm not on roidz. Geez. Triceps were there to begin with, if I were using, I wouldn't be afraid to admit it. If that's your kinda thing, do you, boo boo. You're taking a calculated risk for YOUR body. Whatever. Feelskindagoodbeingaccused.jpg
* #1 pet peeve are people claiming natty but not
* Yes
* Under my belt, and watching Eric Helms and Mark Rippetoe vids
* I work a desk job 6-9 hours a day

Some of you suggested I share my workout routine. I generally consider a set 8 reps.

Chest: Cable flys (lower, mid, upper X 3 sets each)

Shoulders: Overhead barpress 3 sets of 135lb &amp; dumbbell flys 3 sets of 30lb. 

Back: shrugs 3 sets/15-20 reps at 275lb

Legs: Leg press 3 sets at 585lb

Abs: I do declined situps holding weights. 3 sets of 8 w/35lb going straight and 2 sets of 8 on each side w/15lb. 

Arms: bar curls 3 sets of 90lb and hammer curls 3 sets of 45lb. 

I usually work back &amp; arms same day, and deadlift and shoulders same day. Pace myself to finish in about an hour. 

For cardio I either play basketball

**EDIT**: Hi all! Here is a quick update with more info. First
To answer the most asked questions:  
* I am 5'11"".  
* I am 23.  
* Like whato1986 mentioned in his [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/x3mm2/in_january_i_decided_to_lose_some_weight_here_is/c5j3ms1)
* Besides running
* I run about three times a week
* I do my workout routine about 2-3 times a week.  
* I also have an abs workout.  
I will write more after work
Also, because I read and learned a lot since January (and I still am) and so I have a lot to share. I still need a name for it though so I am open to suggestions!  
And thanks for all the comments about my beard :D  

**EDIT 2**: Food  
Here is a typical weekday for me.  
For breakfast I have two hard-boiled eggs with a cereal bar and skim milk. Then for lunch I eat either a soup or a salad (coleslaw, I have some fruits (apple, mango, watermelon, melon or pineapple). For dinner, I always have a bowl of salad (leaves, mix or coleslaw) before the actual meal, whole grain pasta, it's a fruit or a water ice with that heat.  
During the weekend, butter substitute (we use the ""I can't believe it's not butter!"") and sugar substitute. I also love Greek yogurt with some granola. We usually go out on weekends so it depends on where we go.  
Also

**EDIT 3**: Exercise  
Like I said
If I don't run, Fat Loss, Muscle), you choose the duration, what you want to focus on (Full Body, Upper Body, Core
Besides that I occasionally bike for one hour on weekends.  
And also, I do like 2.2 miles in 30 minutes. I live in New York and instead of taking the subway, I walk for another 30 minutes before taking the subway to Brooklyn.  

I hope this will help! Don't hesitate to ask me more questions. I also have other pics before/after to post if you want me to.",,t5_2qhx4,1343348755.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/x3mm2/in_january_i_decided_to_lose_some_weight_here_is/

2. I do change my meals sometimes too. It's always a lean meat (chicken, and always dark veggies. I typically grill or bake my chicken with Mrs. Dash seasoning to reduce the sodium.

3. Yes I do abs with each workout. I've also started to bring in additional ab exercises - most recently declined weighted crunches. Decline bench

4. I have also started to do some shoulder work on leg days.

5. I did do SS for about 3 months between pic 2 and 3. It was a great way to jump start me

1. It will NEVER be easier to learn. As a college student you have access to (most likely) an excellent facility that you don't think about dropping your monthly pay check on

2. Someday, on top of gym membership. And if you want to learn all the little secrets on lifting heavy, you might have to go to a more serious gym even. Instead, you probably could have learned a ton from your college friends/classmates who lift heavy. For free. Knowledge for life.

3. People move away and get much busier after college. Even if you really stay in touch with your friends who lift heavy

I'm posting this because I didn't learn as much from my friends in college as I could have

**TL;DR**: Go learn from the experienced lifters in college. It will never be easier than it is right now. No matter if you're fat, female, whatever, someday you're going to want to know.

Edit: just realized I probably shouldn't have put those parentheses in the title but I don't think I can change it.

It's like it's supposed to be a magic fucking button. No self confidence? Lift some weights. Can't get laid? Pump some iron. General unhappiness? Do your squats. If getting in shape is the answer to all of these problems

Don't get me wrong, but it's a fucking *strange* feeling to judge your worth as a human being based exclusively on your powerlifting total. It's also gotten damn near impossible to relate to people. Women are intimidated by my size and build. Men assume I'm an idiot douchebag. 90% of my time is spent lifting, eating to get stronger, reading about lifting methods, programming and periodization and planning my next program or for my next meet. Have few other hobbies and no other passions makes connecting to normal people for anything more than a couple hours damn near impossible - I will inevitably want to talk lifting and they're just uninterested.

I figured I could meet women who share the same passion for lifting that I do, since I wouldn't want to interrupt my training to talk to people, anyway)

Regarding social awkwardness: my problem isn't so much that I'm socially inept (but I can see how that's the assumption from this post), so they can't understand or relate when I want to squat 600lbs for the sake of squatting 600lbs.

Regarding ""pics or GTFO"": Sorry

I work in a large office building that has many amenities, for the employees of the various offices that rent space in the building. My particular office has disproportionally more young women than men, and they are incredibly mean. For example, for my birthday they banded together to buy me a purple and pink yoga mat and demanded I attend the free lessons. 

I originally intended to write about my experience being the only male in the Friday yogalates class, I have to hold my farts in for 45 minutes at a time and I still feel like a creep, but my balance and flexibility have greatly improved. Plus, another guy joined the class. 

What I’m going to write about is my first experience at a Zumba class. Somehow drunk me betrayed sober me and agreed to attend a Zumba class with my malicious coworkers. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Zumba

I knew I was in trouble 5 minutes before the class began when the super enthusiastic instructor put on a belly dancing belt with all the bells on it. And

Once the music started, and then some synapses failed to fire in my brain and instead of repeating her motions I would flail like I was having a seizure. It was incredibly frustrating seeing something, and not being able to do it. After that class I feel like I can sympathize with anyone who is retarded, or left handed, or, god forbid, both. 

Each song last about 5 minutes and consisted of a lot of shaking of body parts that I did not have. By the time I could figure out the sequence of steps, when the instructor gave us a choice between a Russian song and a hip hop song. I loudly voted for the Russian song, despite the centuries of animosity between our nations, hoping that our bit of shared blood would give me a chance to shine. And shine I did. I jumped and kicked and cancan-ed like the glorious Slavic beast I am. But there was no redemption, it was 5 minutes of glory amidst 50 minutes of failure. The class ended with a few ballet stretches to a thundering rendition of Swan Lake, which barely drowned out my sobs. 

No amount of scrubbing could wash off the shame I currently feel. If the wife was to leave me for a manlier man, or get a motorcycle to feel manly again.

In high school, but I never really pushed myself to my true abilities. The only sport I did practice to become above average at was baseball, but I never strength trained or got into really good shape. I was too lazy, I would just practice fundamentals and drills. One thing that always bothered me was that I was always the butt end of jokes. Growing up, I just learned to deal with it and shake it off. I had pretty much no confidence in high school, and I just kind of got by. My weekends were spent playing video games or Photoshopping/making art on the computer. (Which I was too embarrassed to really tell anyone about in high school) I had little concept of a social life.   
  
I told myself when I went to college, but I had more of a social life. The next semester I hit the gym every other day, just kind of going through the motions. In about March I saw some progress, and I started researching more. I came to this subreddit, and I read a lot of the programs and kind of built my own off of what I read. Fittit has really helped push me. My routine has changed a lot through the year, but this is what I currently do.  

  
  
Monday - Back/Shoulders  
Tuesday - Run a *hard* mile
Wednesday - Legs  
Thursday - Another hard mile
Friday - Chest/Arms  
Saturday - Mile followed by core work  
Sunday - Break  
  
  
I have successfully followed this routine for the past 3 months

  
  
Back/Shoulder day - Military press, bent over rows, face pulls, chainsaws, close grip chin ups  
  
Legs - Squats, power cleans, leg curls

Chest/Arms - Bench, flys, pull ups, curls, skull crusher, chair dips

Core - Planks, In and Outs, and some other exercises I'm not sure the names of.  

  
  
My lift numbers are  
Bench - 245 max  
Squat - 335 max  
Deadlift - 375 max  

I am 6'4"" @ 185 lbs. My diet is pretty much all meat with some fruit. I eat junk food when I am out with friends

In the past year my confidence has gone up more then I could have imagined. I look, too. I got my first 4.0 since 7th grade this past semester with the only A+ in my digital art class. I am not trying to advertise, but if you are interested in what I mean by digital art, feel free to check out my portfolio at www.brandonspahn.com. I'm also a lot more focused, and I manage my time to get a lot more things done. I plan on using this following year to continue my new years resolution. The gym has changed my life around.

I had many requests in my previously very successful post on /r/fitness, asking me how I developed specific parts of my core. The annotated picture is linked below next to two other pictures of my own from the past 6 months, to prove I did not prepare for that picture especially.

To get a core like this, rather than a 8 pack. But below is a very detailed description and pictures of my core routine.

I train core twice a week

My first superset (for the obliques and intercostals) involves doing a side plank

My second superset involves classic situps, finally ending on more planks - for 4 sets.

* [meat slop](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/10/meat-slop/) Thank silverhydra. Simple to cook, good by itself (if cutting), or with rice (while bulking.) Definitely take his advice of re-heating with an egg now and then

* Greek yogurt. I usually buy trader joe's plain, fruit, milk, etc. A great way to hit your protein numbers. For instance, just blending 2 cups of the stuff with 2 ON 100% Choc Whey protein scoops will net you 96g of protein at 500 calories. For people asking, ""How the hell do you hit your protein requirements when they're so high?"" - there's one good answer. 

I personally really like shakes consisting of protein powder (many flavors work), and greek yogurt. 

* Chocolate Milk. One of the best post-workout foods

* Psyllium Husk. Good source of fiber, move nicely. Can be useful if you're on some sort of protein heavy, restricted diet that doesn't keep things flowing on its own. Supposedly has some heart health benefits, though I haven't done that research myself. YMMV. You can either just mix it with water/juice and deal with quickly downing it, or mix it into a shake or similar.

* Salsa. What a great food. Tomatoes, a bit of spice. Goes great on eggs, or with chips, if the carbs fit into your goals. I also think it can spice up veggies nicely. *edit* I specifically mean good, fresh Salsa here. Think more what you'd find at Wholefoods (or a small Taqueria/Mexican store if you happen to live near one), and less the jar of salsa you'd find next to the Frito Lays in the chip aisle.

* Hot sauce and mustard. Two great condiments with pretty much zero cals. Skip the mayo and ranch

* Almonds are an awesome food. But respect the portion size. I could probably eat a bag of salted almonds without blinking, or count it out. I believe it's between 23 and 30 almonds. Again, scale is best. This will make you realize how small an actual serving of almonds should be, which comes in around 160-170 cals. This will keep you honest when you snack on them in the future.

* Avocados. A true superfood. I'd link to something written by Silverhydra, so be careful if you're cutting. Probably a food to keep in your diet for life though.

* Remember your macros, or Chipotle, Oreos, or similar? Eat them...now and then. If you have a calorie goal, realize your nutrition is going to be sub-optimal that day, and you may have to skimp on your other meals. But, overall, i.e.

*edit: adding*

* Buy a food scale. The $50 you spend on an Oxo or similar kitchen scale will pay off in dividends over the years.

I take in around 1800 calories in the spring/summer and 3000+ calories in the fall/winter while keeping protein intake above 150 grams a day. Carbs and fats play themselves out after I get my protein in

day 1 - chest/tris  
2 - back/bis  
3 - legs  
4 - shoulders

During the time I have been using fittit, untrue, and downright dangerous advice given by users who clearly don't know what they are talking about. 

Some of these include telling concerned newbies that their chest shape is because of a pulled muscle
""heal back"" into shape. That achieving a 3"" increase in bicep size in 3 months on a caloric deficit is realistic

I therefore implore newbies to take the advice given to you in this subreddit with a grain of salt. If the advice given is accompanied by a legitimate source or article (preferably peer reviewed) or a video showing you the correct form

To those out there who would give advice

For any wondering


EDIT: Downvote if you want, following the advice of someone on an internet forum. I'm just trying to introduce a bit of professionalism and credibility to the advice giving culture here. We are all here to help improve each others fitness, so let's start acting like it.

I got in and there wasn't many people around, switching between muscle groups randomly, not completing sets etc.), just a general nuisance to the other members. I ignored them and pressed on to start my routine (Bent over rows).


Well one of the swag kids looks at me and my stance, laughing at the fact I was only using a 15kg barbell for it (I'm not a big guy). I kept ignoring but I was getting pretty riled up.


One of the kids says to his mates ""yo I bet I can wreck this guy in pull ups he's so tiny"". Bear in mind I'm about 6'1 and 70kg and not big by any means (skinnyfat if anything) and this guy was at most 5'10"" and the arms of a starved stick insect. That set me off.


I moved off from the rows and over to the bar for neutral grip pull ups


A couple of people had started watching me do this, fifteen.... I went to twenty. I was furious and sore but I pressed on. Twenty five, I was really sweating and gritting teeth. One of the onlooking guys (who was ripped to all hell) in front of me smirked and nodded at me in what I think was saying ""Do it man. Finish it.""


I completed thirty seven pull ups in a single set after not going to the gym for approximately three months. I don't know if that's a big thing or not compared to /r/fitness standards but I was extremely proud of myself considering my old personal best was fourteen. I hopped down


I wish I could say I turned to him, picked up my towel and went to the toilets to silently cry from the pain my arms were in.


I came out about three minutes later, the little shit had attempted to do the same thing and only made six and a half pull ups. That was a nice touch.

-----------

Answers to some of the questions you all have been asking.  Sorry in advance for the spelling and grammatical mistakes. 

I compete in power lifting. I’ve done a few meets and have won a few.  I stop competing and have focused on training. One day I want to be the strongest lifter in the U.S. and I don’t see the point in wining local meets anymore.  The only thing that matters is a national win.  I have been training for about 6 years and obtained a degree in exercise science.  I recommend reading a lot on exercise(not muscle and fitness) and try a bunch of different programs.  Find what works for you.  I don’t really care about my appearance. I am not over weight.  I just did my body fat percentage and is about 8%.  Vanity doesn’t mean a whole to me.  I would rather be small and strong than big and weak.  That is my opinion and that’s not a shot at body builders.  You guys train for something completely different and I respect that.  I started using knee sleeves once my knees started hurting (I don’t know if from powerlifting or any other sports injury). They don’t help with strength but make my knees stay warm.  Yes I have trained in chuck and vibrams.  I currently deadlift in my vibrams.  The squat shoes helps with my depth. I can’t really tell you all how long it will take to hit the 500 pound mark. A little advice sometimes less is more

My program
Day 1.

Squats 6 sets of 3 reps.  Last set of 3 is near max.
Dynamic Squats. 3 sets of 4.  Keep weight about 50%. Focus on form and speed
Hamstring and Calf work.  Whatever I feel like doing that day.
Bench 6 sets of 3 reps.  Last set of 3 is near max.
Dynamic Bench
Chest accessory work.  Whatever I feel like doing that day.

Day 2.

Deadlift 6 sets of 3 reps.  Last set of 3 is near max.
Back work such as pull ups, low back.  I  mix it up.

Day 3. 

Box Squats 6 sets of 3 reps.  Last set of 3 is near max.
Dynamic Box Squats. 3 sets of 4.  Keep weight about 50%. Focus on form and speed

So I got to it. Cutting a mostly carbs and hitting the gym at least 3 times a week. I started off PATHETIC. I couldn't squat my own body weight more than 12 reps. Never dead lifted in my life
Cardio DID help drop the first 10 pounds, whole wheat bread and pastas here and there. I love healthy eating now. I'm addicted. 

6 months later, and bench 80. I hit the gym still 3-4 times a week working on my back, triceps, everything I can. Call me a gym rat. And here's the progress. Made it in time for the summer and bought a bikini in a size SMALL. WOOT!

1361283032.0,18tgam,From runner to lifter: My progress and the lessons I learned,xgibran,1162,282,285,"So 3 years ago I finally realized [220lbs](http://i.imgur.com/CXynKvq.jpg) was too much for a 5’10” guy and decided to do something about it by running. I sucked pretty bad but I liked it

I thought that if I kept eating at a deficit (you know, where’s my six-pack!? At around this point my running partner got injured and along with a bit of back pain and the rather unexpected results I lost some motivation and started doing less and less Kms. 

I realized I’d bounced back to nearly 200lbs so I start running seriously again, but didn’t watch my diet so I stayed at around 190lbs. That’s when I discovered /r/fitness and since I was getting [decent times](http://i.imgur.com/ooXU5LA.png) I asked how I could complement and strength training was suggested. So I started doing StrongLifts, after reading the book.

To shorten the story at least a bit, it started to feel the other way around, to the point I dropped running altogether (except 3K a day running to the gym and back). At first I couldn’t understand why cardio seemed to be shunned a bit by the community, but coming from it I can see why so many do not favor it. If you enjoy it, great! Just be aware that if you only run at best you’ll end up looking ordinary.

So I became a lifter. When SL was too much I moved to Madcow and recently I started 5/3/1.
“Unfortunately” I fell completely in love with strength training and did not fret  over my diet beyond getting enough protein (Read: cake and assorted sweets were consumed in considerable amounts), as you can infer by the wild hair)](http://imgur.com/a/453O6). It has been 11 months since I started and my stats have changed as follows:

Squat: 95lbs - 320lbs (Smith Machine half squats vs sub-parallel barbell squats.)
Bench: 135lbs - 260lbs
Deadlift: 185lbs - 420lbs
OHP: 45lbs - 160lbs

I plan to stick with 5/3/1 and focusing on strength for 5 more months

Things I think I did right:

* Find a program and stick to it. Do not do random stuff or the program the gym “trainer” pulled out of his butt.

* Previous point doesn’t mean SS

* Focus on strength for a while. I know this sounds like circlejerking
* If you do SL/SS
* On deadlifts
* Be a calculated coward. Don't fear getting under the bar, except a couple of very, very mild sprains I spotted at once and stopped the training session, allowing me to be perfectly fine for the next one. I know that If I had been stubborn it could have been much worse. On the other hand, I pulled 405 for the first time with a fever and almost fainted, which may or may not have been very wise.
* Following on the previous point, but a lifetime pursuit you're just getting yourself into. A single training session is not important in the greater scheme of things, so if you have to cut it short, failed a set or your boss needs you to put in extra hours and you miss the gym completely, it's not the end of the world, as long as you pay your dues every other day.
* This community is awesome, too.

* **Edit:** One point I missed: The bros will quite likely harass you a bit, listen to them but find reputable sources to corroborate whatever advice you get that isn't in line with your program. Some are harsher and may mock you for using only the bar or paltry weights. Forego your ego and be patient. You will show them (and more importantly, yourself) in due time. 

Things I didn’t do or did wrong:

* Cardio is cool

* Calorie control is key for weight loss

* If you care for aesthetics (we all do) and aren't particularly gifted in that department

* Don't neglect your core! You'll get a good workout from the main lifts

* Supplement from the start if you aren’t getting enough from your diet, vitamins and creatine fairly recently, and it has really boosted my performance.

So in closing

One friend in particular decided to bring along his dog, he does great for the first few days, runs around, enjoys being a dog, etc.

Now, which is on the heavy side, but I was taking an extra load off the less experienced hikers in our group. 

So, we have to climb back out of the valley we camped in, with an entire day of uphill switchbacks.  By midday, it's clear that the heat is getting to the Husky.  That thick fur wasn't made for any kind of heat, and he starts stopping at every shady spot and collapsing.  Unfortunately we're also running low on water because our last water access was in the valley.

We continue hiking, he gives up.  He lay down in the shade and sat there panting, unresponsive.  I gave him the rest of my water, but nothing changed.  It was kind of a collective 'oh shit' moment.  After some discussion, I said I'd try and hike him out.  I didn't know whether or not I'd be able to - I had no water left but the hike had been fairly easy for me so far and I wanted to try.  The dog's owner (ex-military) had tried it earlier in the day, but didn't make it more than a few hundred yards.

So we threw him up on my shoulders, with my hands holding his legs like a hog-tied calf), and he was a heavy little fucker, but I did it.  I hiked the dog back to the car, roughly 5 miles away, entirely uphill.  The best part?  I finished a good 10 minutes before everyone else in the party, stuck the dog in the air conditioned car

The look on their faces when I came jogging back to check up on them was priceless.

Random stuff I felt like working more on that week.
**Friday Saturday Sunday**
These were usually rest days


I can't really tell you exercises I did cause it changed a lot along with the big stuff that everyone knows for each muscle group.  When you get bored of what you're doing look up videos online of the muscle group your going to work out next and do those exercises you don't always do.


Find a friend to help you when you get started.  I got lucky and had a buddy who was a football player for a small college who was will to work out with the weak kid and got me started.  It also gives you a great reason to keep going if you have someone that will make you go.

In the summer of 2010 my boyfriend (Jimmy) and I (Shane) decided that we had to stop messing around and get fit. What has ensued is quite the transformation in our bodies and improvement in our health. Before decided to get fit

**I started out in July 2010 at 197 lbs at 6'2""**

Couple 1: http://i.imgur.com/4QU3K.jpg

**Food:**

Starting in July we began to watch what we ate: using light versions of foods we enjoyed, then really started to pick up once we began using MyFitnessPal to track calories. We had a budget and recorded everything that we ate and stuck to our calorie budgets. We didn't really change what we ate too much, just how much. Portion control would be my advice for the key to weight loss, at least at first.

More recently, cottage cheese, greek yogurt, lean chicken, fish, turkey, and occasional beef. We take protein shakes in the morning for breakfast.

**Physical Activity:**

In August 2010 I began weight lifting 3x per week (MWF) on a split routine with a friend of mine and doing cardio 2-3 times per on the off days about 4 months after that (January 2011). I progressed from elliptical to running and can do 6-7 miles easily now. Jimmy didn't do any cardio until January 2011 of this year

**The Results (So Far):**

Over the past year Jimmy has lost an average of 1.5 lbs/week. My weight loss has been more about body recomposition. I went from a size 36 to a 31 while losing only 10 lbs or so on the scale.

**Here is where I sit now

I'll be the first one to admit that the form is FAR from perfect

[Video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-zG3DLY0w)

Red plate is 45, and then the 10 and 5.

22 years old, but I lifted on and off (messing around with football and the like) for a bit before that.  My approach to training has always been gain strength on the main barbell lifts and do volume work on assistance exercises (mostly 5 sets of 10).  I've ran a fair number of programs from 5/3/1, to some Westside-like splits, to Texas Method, to Madcows intermediate and advanced, and I tried Sheiko once a while back.  Now, I make my own splits according to what I believe I need.  I'm studying to become a strength and conditioning specialist, repeating that as much as I can

As for my other lifts

My diet is pretty much whatever.  I have a hard time gaining weight because I get full VERY quickly, some protein powder, canola oil, a banana, a half cup of oats, and some strawberries.  I'll put in some chocolate syrup as well from time to time.  While I was bulking to 200 I was counting calories, but I don't do that anymore.  I now have a pretty good idea of what I need to do to lose or gain weight without tracking it.

I plan on doing my first meet on November 5th.  Up until then

That's all I can think of adding.  I'm more than happy to answer any other questions.  ",,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1k1qr3/hit_a_lifetime_goal_of_a_600_pound_deadlift/

In the last 5 months between my last post:

* I bulked for ~3 months using IIFYM with ~2800 calories per day
* During my bulk I used greyskull LP with some minor modifications.  I am very consistent and I only missed 3-5 workouts in the last 5 months.  Even when I missed a workout I did as much BW work at home as I could.
* I track calories very carefully and use a scale.  I've only said ""fuck it"" and not tracked for ~10 days over the last 5 months.  Even then I didn't go completely nuts.  I did eat more chocolate than I should have over Christmas though.
* I then cut using IIFYM
* My lifts are now: Bench 205x6; OHP 115x6; Squat 275x6; Dead 355x6.

Okay, sure, just finish your sets out. But if the gym is absolutely jammed full of people and no adjustments need to be made to the machine you're using, just let someone work in (like the next guy i asked did without hesitation).

The lone exception to this is if someone asks you to work in curls between your squat sets. The only option here is to grab the heaviest plate on/around the rack and hit them upside the head.

**The vitals!:**

* Height: 6'5""
* Weight (before): 275lb/125kg
* Weight (after): 213lb/98kg

**Lifts**:

My routine focuses on upper body (when you're a 6'5"" fatty and a mountain biker, 79lb/36kg max). I'll typically throw in some weighted dips (88lb/40kg in plates on a chain around the waist) to fatigue the tris, much shaking ensues!)

Wednesday is back with  4 x 10 pull ups

Fri is shoulders and arms with OHP (4 x 10, EZ curls, chins and weighted dips again. 

Cardio was a simple 5k run on Tue

**Diet**:

Diet has been a tough one. As a tall guy with a consideralbe amount of heft, everything else will fall into place. For me, tracking calories on MFP has been a huge help if for no other reason than helping me realise that a) my prior estimates of food were way,way off and b) I am one of those people who tracks and graphs everything and having hard numbers helped me have something tangible to stick to. I found it easiest if I took my required ~230g and spread them across the day beforehand and then more or less IIFYM'd the rest to fall under the 1800-1900 mark, the weight started to fall off at a pace I was happy with. Cottage cheese, Coke Zero, tuna and shaved ham have all served as great 'plugs' for the hunger and IF has worked really well with my lifestyle.

Over the past couple of months, I've become absolutely crazy about climbing. I'm currently working on 5.10+ routes and I go approximately 4-5 times a week for 1-2 hours each session. I weigh 123 lbs now.

So for years I've pretty much kinda fucked around and didn't eat properly. In high school I weighted about 210LB lost some weight down to 155LB then went back up to 185LB which I stayed until about last year. Unfortunately I don't have a photo from last year but in the first pic you can see a picture from 2009. I pretty much looked the same from then until June of last year. 

I'm pretty happy with the results but I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and see how it plays out. Going to try and get a bit leaner and maybe make some more gains slowly.


In the first pic I believe I weighted about 185-190LBs. Right now I weight 155LB. I'm 27 and 5' 8""

EDIT:Routine and Diet

TLDR; Modified SS

Well I started off with doing the same crappy routine I was doing for years with just a modification to my diet. I think most people find it too overwhelming to do too much at once so I'd pick one small thing and do it. Then when I started seeing progress I'd make more changes instead of doing everything at once.


I started with a caloric deficit without counting


I'm mainly doing SS type lifts with some additions. I injured my shoulder in December so didn't lift for two months.


This is what I'm doing right now. A note though. Until about a few weeks ago I was only lifting ONCE a week


I lift Monday and Thursdays and do the following:

Note: I was doing 3x6 for everything for a while but instead of upping the weight I decided to up the reps for hyperatrophy. I'm not really doing that much weight at all.


Bench press 165LB 3x10 (I used to do 215LB 3x6 but it was hurting my shoulder)

Squats 185LB 3x5 (I'm a cyclist so I'm actually trying not to get too huge of legs
 Deadlifts 275LB 5x1

Bent over dumbell rows 45LB 3x10

Dumbell Shrugs 50LB 3x10 

Curls 30LB 3x8

Pull ups 8-10 depends

Face pulls



I also do 30minutes of cardio on a bike or spin bike once a week.

As for diet

* Most of the new users are going to come here, and then *actually go read it* (which takes about 45 minutes in total).  We may not notice such new users until they ask a good question (because they read the FAQ) and even then, they may not be noticeable. They are the great silent majority of our users.   

* Some of the new users will not read the FAQ


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi! Welcome to Fittit! You're going to love it here.

We saw you coming and have collected answers to your question **[right here](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness)**.


Welcome!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's welcoming and friendly and lets new people know that [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) is a place where they can get information about improving their fitness.   I've counted: about 25% of the time, usually, they just were oblivious to the FAQ.  Also: you can get special bonus points if you change the link to  the actual section of the FAQ where the OPs question is directly answered.   Being welcoming and friendly lets new people know they are welcome here with their fitness questions, and it helps create new [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) members who then turn around and help more.  

Also, your answering this way above saves the time and effort someone more knowledgeable would have to spend answering the question, or referring to the FAQ themselves.  It's classic division of labor.  Thus, **even if you don't feel knowledgeable about fitness, if you know the question is answered in the FAQ, you're doing everyone here a big favor if you post the above copypasta.**

More importantly: I recommend you use the copypasta because *we need you fresh for the actually hard questions.*   You see

You only have so much time and energy.  And, how I can I get fit?""  you get antsy, and upset.  Don't these people learn? Don't they see the other posts and know they should read the FAQ?  It becomes easy to look past the point that all these new people are completely new, they've never seen [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) before, and they don't benefit from its past. So you might find yourself getting angry with them, and it's tempting to write something snippy or sarcastic.  **Don't**.  When you reach the point that you are feeling snippy and sarcastic to the new kids, it's time to step aside, and let others pick up the slack.  

Finally, even though the same information you're providing is already in the FAQ.   But they're likely to start by snapping at you for telling them to read the FAQ ""when I've already read it and question's not in there"" (it is); or by saying ""I wanted to talk to someone, not read some wall of text.""  Such posters can be exhausting.  Don't feel like you have to answer all their questions -- in fact, you can ignore them and just move on if you like.  It's unreasonable for new people to believe they deserve individualized fitness and diet coaching, particularly when their fitness needs are identical to the vast majority of people who come here.  This is often referred to as the ""snowflake problem""; so many who come here think their problems are unique, like snowflakes, when in fact, and so the solution is identical.  

**TL; DR**

* Read each submission in the new queue carefully. 
* Refer new users who ask questions answered in the FAQ directly to the FAQ. Use the provided welcoming copypasta.   
* Don't answer questions if you feel frustrated by the repeated questions of new people.  Move away from the new queue
* Beware of the 'snowflakes': users who think they are unique -- and so deserve unique

Since there are often posts on here about eating healthy on the cheap and easy

This recipe is completely customizable and pretty simple to do.  The whole process took about an hour

* 18 eggs
* 1 package of low sodium bacon. (I've used turkey sausage as well
* 15 oz can of low sodium black beans.
* medium bag of cheese
* 10 pk of the biggest tortillas I can find.
* 1 jar mild salsa
* Sriacha (is not figured into the cost of burrito because everyone should already have some)

Step by step recipe in with pictures.

Macros: I cannot stress enough that these are approximate b/c I didn't make sure every burrito had the same exact measurement of ingredients.  If you wanna weigh all the stuff out then distribute evenly

Cals :493/ Fat: 21.8g/ Sodium: 969.5mg/ Carbs: 46.75g/ Protein: 27.65g

(the 3rd number is sodium because some people care about that

Since I used bacon

Also, I've found that low-carb and wheat burritos are too stiff and tear prone for this activity.

I fucking love these things.

Edit: fixed album settings
Edit 2: I just finished the first one.  It was one that busted while rolling so the salsa juice ran out making it a little hard to unwrap bc the paper stuck a little.  AND the black beans made it a little dry tasting but nothing a little Crystals hot sauce didn't fix.  Enjoy.

1350056967.0,11dbsf,Random Tips from 10 Years of Experience Being Both Fit and Unfit,iPUNCH,1054,256,206,"I'm 29 years old, I've even worked as a personal trainer. 

Read and re-read the FAQ

Before I begin with tons of randomness, and knowing your own body and its reactions to things like stress, training, rep-range, nutrition, macros, etc, I cannot ever begin to suggest what will work for you, and try again.

**Training for Hypertrophy

I'm sure the vast majority of people browsing r/fitness are training for vanity - they want to get big and lean. I know strength is a huge theme for r/fitness, people start training to gain muscle, not strength.

I too trained for years for hypertrophy alone, and progress would often halt until I changed up my programming. Broscience often got in the way of doing what really needed to be done, and that's to build a solid foundation of strength before ever trying to train for hypertrophy.

Even though I had what most would consider a very solid foundation already

Starting Strength is known as a beginner program, I also put on a great deal of muscle mass, and lost bodyfat. Granted, I was very overweight at the beginning, and much of my gains were through muscle-memory, but I've greatly exceeded where I was prior to my injury (and at that time I was a personal trainer).

Since my linear progress slowed, I'm getting much better results in growth due to how heavy a load I can handle for higher rep counts. Nearly double where I was when I was training for hypertrophy. Plus, my core is stronger, I'm more resistant to injury, etc. I do still include heavy compound movements in every session - I feel this is a must.

Another important tip: *Stick to your program*. Results take time. If you're not seeing any results after 3-6 months

**Diet and Nutrition for Maximizing Gains**

Eat. Eat. Eat. *And eat some more*. There's not much more too it. Any and all ""hardgainers"" just aren't eating enough. There are fast metabolisms, peanut butter, and beef. Total calories in are more important than calorie timing, but I find that feeding every 2-3 hours is easier to bulk than consuming huge meals that leave you feeling like you ate a few bricks.

**Diet and Nutrition for Recomposition and Fat Loss**

Most gurus will tell you that recomposition is nearly impossible, or were heavy, it's scary to eat as much food that is necessary to bulk, so recomp is likely the best way for your comfort zone.

Recomposition is possible, eating plenty of carbs on the days you train to refuel your muscles is vital to growth. But on your ""off"" days, drop carb intake to a moderate level, and increase your healthy fat intake. Things like avacado, salmon, and almonds are excellent sources of healthy fats. Use calorie calculators, and macro-nutrient calculators to find out your maintenance intake, and subtract 500 calories on your off days. Progress will indeed be slower

For fat loss, but paying close attention to macros is also important. Lower, to moderate carbs are best for losing fat. And it's a good idea to cycle your total calories consumed and carbohydrates, to prevent homeostasis from occurring. 

Whether you are trying to gain mass, I cannot stress enough the importance of properly tracking calories. Do it for a few days, and I guarantee you will realize that you are missing your target calories. Even the slightest discrepancy could negate progress, so pay attention, write it down, and adjust accordingly.

**Cardio for Fat-loss**

Cardio is wonderful for conditioning and overall health

What's always worked best for me is 10-20 minutes of sprints

Low-intensity cardio, consume some BCAAs before low-intensity cardio in a fasted state.

**More Random Tips**

Back pain? Always check with a doctor first. If it's a severe injury, it will cost you. If the back pain is moderate, you need to reexamine your form, focus more on mobility and flexibility, especially in the posterior chain (hams, glutes, lower back), lumbar surgery

Can't do a pull-up/chin-up? Don't do assisted movements

Supplements? Caffeine, but they're not the holy grail some people think they are. Other supplements do indeed work, but they're likely not worth their cost. That all comes down to how much you want to spend - but do your research first. Examine.com is an excellent resource. I personally use Scivation Xtend in the AM, along with a pre-workout mix (Jack3d usually), then for post, I consume 8 ounces of grape juice and a scoop or Optimum Nutrition Whey. At nights, to keep calories down

Rest! Get 8 or more hours of sleep if possible, preferably more. Remember, growth takes place during rest. Training just provides the stimulus that triggers growth reactions. Those triggers are no good without the building blocks (calories/macros) and rest.

Routine and Dedication. No diet or training program will ever work well if you're half-assing it. I suggest logging every workout, etc. Keep to your schedule, stay motivated and dedicated. If you can't, you only have yourself to blame for lack of progress. I understand life gets in the way, as does injury, sickness, etc. These cannot be avoided at times, you cannot be stopped.

**Closing**

Pretty much all of this is common sense, blood, sweat, and tears, and you will go far.

**Personal Story**

I just came off a five year hiatus due to severe injury, strength, and self-worth. One day, something clicked inside me, telling me to not let the pain control me anymore. Now, I've lost 75 lbs while gaining significant amounts of muscle, increasing my strength to advanced levels (for example, I'm strong, but compared to where I was just a year ago, but most of all

Finally, lifting light at first, surprised at the little amount of weight he could handle after all this time competition lifting. But after time his body adapted. Everyone including myself told him to chill out and slow down, but the mother fucker didn't. One day, I walked into the back room where the shock mat is and saw him loading plates onto the bar preparing for his first dead lift. I yelled at him to stop, he didn't break gaze and looked directly ahead and just said fuck you.

This is pretty thrilling.  It's great to be in a focused online community

Even so

A main source of complaints recently has been the place of images and video.  One doesn't have to stare at the ""new"" feed for long to realize that many of the images which get posted are kind of perhaps maybe topical to fitness; but they don't necessarily encourage fitness

Everyone likes a really good joke image

Even so, and it's great to get feedback when you yourself have improved); there's a particularly useful ""how to squat"" video.  There's a lot of examples.  

So a question the mods are considering: how do we keep the community focused on fitness

And, but only when linked within the text of a ""self""post (that is, for no karma reward)?  

While generic external links are still welcome, if you really think that image of the thinking dinosaur is important to post to /r/fitness, you can still post it -- you just aren't going to get karma for it.  The implication being, if the only thing you get out of posting an image is karma (and not, say, a better fitness experience, which should be your focus here) then don't post it. 

Some of the mods like the idea.  Some of them aren't so sure. The main question being: will this make for a better /r/fitness community? It might be worth trying on a trial basis

What do you think?

- Usually in a good mood. Getting professional treatment for my anxiety disorder. Have a well paying job coding Java and looking forward to even better professional opportunities in the future.

- Hobbies include zen meditation, writing a book about the science of fitness and nutrition (with accessibility in mind), reading actual books, drawing/painting, and starting in May I will be training with an olympic weightlifting coach 3x a week. Oh and playing pc games :P, but significantly less and only on the weekend.

- Generally happy

**What I did:**

- Made the following changes

- Caloric deficit

- &lt;100g carbs a day from low GI foods

- Intermittent Fasting.

- Lifted. Started out with textbook SS. After I just couldn't make any more gains (squat 240lbs, ohp 125) because of caloric deficit kinda got fuckarounditis. Switched over to high-bar, doing oly lift drills, experimented w/ different lifts. Whatever, goal was fat loss. Will start eating more and actually getting strong when I work with my oly coach in may.

- Rest days: sometimes swimming, stretching, pre-hab with a good podcast on (haven't had any injuries but I'm terrified of them, everyone should probably do this stuff anyways).

- Hit my alcoholic bottom, got introduced to AA (this actually happened a few months in to my diet/fitness transformation)

- Left my ego behind. Realized if I could get fit and sober alone it would have happened a long time ago.

- Constantly nerding out over fitness online.

Anyways. I'm on the last legs of this looonnng diet. Probably another few weeks then I'm ready to eat more. It's psychologically daunting but I'm sick of being weak and eventually want to compete in olympic lifting recreationally at least.

My workout consists of an early morning hike to [Heart Rock](http://www.1000wordsphotos.com/heartrock/heartrock3-c.jpg). It's two miles there and two back. I do 80 squats, 50 leg lifts. For my dumbbell routine I have twenty pound weights, I'm not too familiar with the names of anything but curls but I target each specific group in a 20-30 minute routine.

I feel so much better. The biggest difference physically is I don't have joint pain anymore. I can breathe so much easier now as well. There's a lot to get used to

I was super surprised, we're all just doing our thing in there man."" 

Got a picture with him too: http://i.imgur.com/rDmP8.jpg

**EDIT: This is as much of the ab workout as I can remember**

**FIRST QUARTER:**
Start laying fully straight out on your back, and again hold for around 20-30 seconds. Finally, lift your legs to as much of a full 90 degree as you can manage, and again hold for 20-30 second. Once you're done holding, starting doing crunches, trying to reach up and touch your toes. Do 25. Then lower your left leg to a 45 degree angle while keeping your right leg straight up, and touch your left hand to your right foot 25 times. Then switch legs and do it right hand to left foot 25 times. That's as much as I remember from the first quarter. That's most of it.

**SECOND QUARTER:**
Start out in a plank, hold again for 30 seconds. Now lift up your left foot and right hand, hold for 30 seconds. Switch, hold again for 30 seconds. Switch to a side plank on your right side. Point your left hand straight up, and make circles in the air with your pointer finger. Hold this for 1 minute. Then, with your left hand, reach down underneath you and ""scoop"" and come all the way back up with your hand. Do this 25 times. Then do 25 ""bounces, switch over to your left side and do the same stuff.

**THIRD QUARTER:**
Here is where I'm starting to forget a lot of stuff

* Bicycles (50)

* Something like a candlestick pull

I don't remember much more than this. Sorry that I'm being forgetful everyone. It was a lot of stuff really rapid fire and I had a tough enough time just trying to keep up! Hope this is helpful though to everyone that wanted it.

1340116838.0,v9zva,What 5-months of Starting Strength looks like on a 23-year old female: from 135 lbs to 146 lbs,chinadork7733,1101,320,268,"[Front](http://imgur.com/a/P4Reo) and [Back](http://imgur.com/a/vcrK2) **NSFW** progress pics from January 15th to June 18th of this year as I went from 61 kg to 66 kg (135 lbs to 146 lbs). NSV: My thighs don't touch each other anymore! And this is the heaviest I’ve been in my life! I’m 172 cm (~5’8”) and 23-years old. 

QUESTION: Do you think I am too bulky? My arms have gotten quite big and people comment on their size all the time. I’m too self-conscious to wear tank tops now. :-/ 

**Routine** (I switched up my routine a lot because I get bored easily

Tuesday, bench press, overhead press, deadlift, power clean, clean and jerk, chin-ups

Monday, which usually included at least 30 minutes of High-Intensity Interval Training (sprints, push-ups, abs, jump squats) and/or a few tabattas. I don’t think my lifts progressed as much as they would have if I hadn’t been doing 9-hours of BJJ with intensive cardio every week, but BJJ is my life, so... 

Saturday: Either long-distance biking

**Lifts** (I hurt my shoulder in April

These are all for 5x3 rep sets: 

Squat: from 45 kg (100 lbs) to 85 kg (187 lbs).

Bench: from 30 kg (66 lbs) to 45 kg (100 lbs)

Overhead Press: from 25 kg (55 lbs) to 40 kg (88 lbs)

Deadlift (this one is for a 5x1 rep set): from 40 kg (88 lbs) to 90 kg (198 lbs)

Power Clean: from 25 kg (55 lbs) to 45 kg (100 lbs)

Chin-ups: from none to 5 

Pull-ups: None. Still can’t do one real pull-up. That is my next major goal.

**Diet**: 

Mainly, I don’t take any supplements. Since I live in China, my food choices are somewhat different than what you might find in the States. I mostly eat eggs, chicken, pork, tofu, fruit, almonds, potatoes, ice cream

I did not follow GOMAD. I experimented with the Paleo diet and other low-carb diets for the first couple months,000 calories a day. I then switched to Intermittent Fasting in May, taking in about 2,500 calories a day in an eight-hour window. IF is my favorite diet so far. I like IF because I tend to binge eat, so eating everything in eight hours works for me. It also prevents the late-night binge fests that I’m prone to. See /r/leangains. 

**My story** (I’m writing this especially to inspire other women to lift heavy and for women struggling with eating disorders): 

I’ve always been skinny and athletic. I ran cross-country in high school and played rugby in college. For the most part, usually running long distances and doing some combination of abs, push-ups, kipping pull-ups, and sprinting. I started training Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) in October 2011 and I was no match for the strength of the other guys on my team. A friend told me that I worked out like a girl. I was pretty offended by that. He said it meant that I did lots of cardio just to stay as skinny as possible while trying to get nice abs, which was true. Two other friends told me that they thought I looked like I had an eating disorder. I was even more offended by that, but I had to admit that it was true. I was 60 kg (130 lbs) at that point

I generally have a poor body image and I developed a bad habit of binge eating. So when I started getting skinny fat in December 2011 despite working out for at least an hour everyday, and the constant encouragement from the men of /r/fitness for women to lift weights. I bought the Kindle version of Starting Strength and the rest is history. 

After I’d been lifting for about a month, you’re getting stronger.” Since then, my teammates have commented numerous times on how much stronger I’ve gotten these past few months. I've also struggled with hip problems for the last several years, and my hip pain has completely vanished since I started doing squats! The best thing, however, is that for the first time in several years, I’m actually happy with the body that I see in the mirror. And I’m not starving myself. Feels good, I’m nowhere near finished with improving myself

To all the women out there: I know how terrifying and intimidating it is to lift in a power rack for the first time. After that first initial set, scared as if I was going to get killed by the barbell or something. Now I have to confidence to lift on my own in a power rack. [Here is a video of me squatting 80 kilos.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-nbLz_gphM&amp;feature=plcp) I know my form is not that great, I've been working on it. Just wanted to show this to any women who were curious what squatz look like. 

Lifting is the best natural high in the world. And that’s saying something coming from a long-distance runner. When I first started

I can't say enough how much I encourage all of you to go out there and start barbell training. Arm yourself with knowledge and go out there to prove to everyone wrong (and prove the fittit community right). 

**TL;DR**: A big thanks to fittit for encouraging women to lift the same way as men: I never would have considered starting SS if it hadn't been for this cyber community (who is perhaps a tad fanatical about their love for Rippetoe) and the ~~male~~ members who consistently advocate similar training programs for men and women.

A year ago I decided to change my life. Who knew changing you health and physique would change other aspects of life. I feel great

I had a 3 day routine that recently became 4 days. 

Day 1: chest
Day 2: biceps
Day 3: cardio and abs
Day 4: running (either around neighborhood or treadmill) 

Then I repeat this. I change up the exercises and switch from barbell to free weights

I drink pre-workout, and omega 3 fatty acids. I eat 5 meals a day, usually a peanut butter sandwich is one of them. Just use common sense for other meals. No fast or fried food, lean meats, low carbs, stuff like that.

Three years of steady progress and I achieved my first chin-up today!!! I know it seems trivial

I stayed around this weight until someone spectacular entered my life, I pretty much followed the Couch to 5K method.

I injured my calf at the end of the summer, I’ve been weight training, using the elliptical trainer, and attending yoga classes (which make SUCH a difference to your overall movement ability!) 

I haven’t followed Weight Watchers in a couple years, so I end up eating about 1500-1600 calories a day. 

I cut out white bread, 20-25% protein and about 35% fat. I still eat what I want to on the weekends…

So, even in primary school! 

145 pounds to 114 pounds
Size 8 to size 2!

I'm going to try and include all the pertinent info I can while describing what I've done during 2012. Please let me know if I left anything out that would be helpful.

As the title says

For January and February I was doing p90x in my apartment but quickly realized I wasn't going to put on much weight that way. I worked out without direction for the next few months

My typical workouts are below,8,5ish, then back up to 10 by dropping the weight.

Chest/Triceps:

* Flat Bench - alternate days between dumbell and barbell
* Incline - almost always dumbell
* Dips - Either unweighted 3x20ish or weighted 3x10
* Flys - On Machine
* Push downs
* Pulldowns 
* Sometimes finish with a variety of push ups
* Sometimes finish with machines if I feel I haven't hit my chest hard enough

Back/biceps:

* Pull ups - Pyramid, and different grips depending on what I'm feeling that day
* Rows - 2 out of 3 of cable
* Lower back extentions
* Recently starting adding in deadlifts
* Back flys
* A variety of curls if needed

Legs/Shoulders:

* Leg press on machine
* Leg extention
* Leg curls
* Calf Raises
* Overhead press (always dumbell)
* Shrugs (almost always barbell)
* Diagonal raises
* Combo later and rear delt raise
* Face Pulls
* 
Abs: I try to mix these in every other lift but I've been bad about it

* Either p90x ab ripper or some weighted sit ups on a decline bench with some V twists mixed in

Lift Numbers
Bench: 1 repped 225 the other day for my PR
OHP: 60 lb dumbells for 120lbs total
Leg press: I generally work my way up to 450lbs over a few sets then come back down. The sled is on a 45 degree angle so I realize my true squat would be much less.
Deadlift: I've just begun deadlifting again

Food: I count my calories every couple weeks to make sure I'm getting close to my goal of 3500-4000 calories. Other than that I just try to eat fairly healthy and get a lot of protein. Through this year I have used two tubs of NOxplode for a preworkout

Plans for the future. I plan on continuing to add weight until April where I will reassess and determine if I want to cut for the summer. I would really like to be up over 200lbs.


Other info: I have been in decent shape before, knees, and lower back. I have modified my lifts accordingly and its one of the reasons my legs have been a little neglected.

25 yo . Male . Height: ~ 5'9'' . Starting weight: 250lbs . Current weight: 190lbs . bf% : unknown (my guess is ~18 or 19%) 

Routine:  Started with SL5x5 with an empty barbell for all lifts, or swimming 4hours/week). I have never tried to 1RM, so I listed my current work weights. (I have been through several cycles of deloading, and dealt with two injuries over the past year. Also primary goal is fat loss, so usually eating at deficit. Excuses for shameful gainz, haha.) 

Squat: 45 to 230

Bench: 45 to 165 

Deadlift: 45 to 220 

OHP: 45 to 125

Penlay Rows: 45 to 135

Diet:  Learned about Paleo about 6 weeks after I started this process on Aug 21st 2011. Switching to a low-carb Primal style paleo diet was a life changer for me and has been the main factor in keeping me consistent/on track for the past year. Never really worry about counting calories or macros; just ate when I was hungry and stopped eating when I was full. I still have cheat meals on weekends and don't bog down if a restaurant doesn't have meats and veggies for me to eat (which is unusual). I have added in sweet potatoes and other healthy carbs to recover glycogen after long endurance training. I plateau'd at 195lbs

Supplements: Vitamin D , Zinc , Magnesium , and Whey protein after heavy lifts . 

New Goals : More strength gains 

Questions for Fittit:  Would someone kindly assess my current bf%?  Also I have started doing more research on novice strength programs and am not sure when I should switch. Does anyone have suggestions? If my primary goals are strength and recomp.

Edit to add training/diet/height

Let me preface by stating that I am by NO means a nutritionist or dieting master, brown rice, etc. Lol

Training days are M-F. 

**Diet on training days (2000 calories)**: 

* Breakfast - 2 pieces of 14 grain whole wheat toast, and 1 banana.
* Pre-workout - Single scoop protein shake
* Post-workout - Double scoop protein shake
* Lunch - 2 pieces toast, sauteed veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, red/green peppers), 1 serving of almonds
* Dinner - Same as lunch.
* Late night - Single scoop protein shake

Diet on off-days is precisely the same minus 2 pieces of bread and a protein shake (1800 total calories). Re-feed days of 2700 calories and as many carbs as I can eat after week 5

**Training program**

* Monday: Strength training on chest, and a little bit of calves for 2 hours followed by 30 minutes/9 miles on stationary bike.
* Tuesday: 2 hours strength training on back/bis
* Wednesday: 2 hours strength training on legs
* Thursday: 2 hours strength training on shoulders
* Friday: 2 hours strength training on arms/abs/calves

That's about it.

Sure I'd have liked to look better but I had the notion that it would require way too much effort than it was worth. Thanks to /r/fitness I was inspired to change and it's been completely worth it. I've progressed further than I ever thought I would

**Goals going in**

Aesthetics. Getting strong is nice but I wanted to look good as my top priority (vain

**Progress**

[Here is my progress album [Warning: dude in underwear]](http://imgur.com/a/6uwV4) (Approximately monthly updates. ~~Sorry about lack of after legs

**My Stats:**

* 23M / 6'1""
* Weight: 183lbs -&gt; 170lbs

**My lifts (In pounds):**

* Squat (3x5): 85 -&gt; 270
* Deadlift (1x5): 145 -&gt; 295
* Bench (3x5): 85 -&gt; 165
* Press (3x5) 65 -&gt; 115

**My Diet:**

Not very strict at first. Didn't eat unhealthily but didn't count macros. Got my about 170g of protein in per day and ate a little more on lift days but that's it.

Generally my diet looked something like this:

Breakfast

* Oatmeal and raisins
* Glass of milk
* Protein Shake

Lunch

* Ham Sandwich on multigrain bread
* Snack Bar (200 calories
* Apple
* Almonds throughout the day

Dinner

* Large Chicken Breast 
* 200 grams of peas
* Half a can of mushroom soup
* Glass of milk
* Protein Shake

The weekends were less structured. I tried to keep them in check but I ate out and drank more than I probably should have

**Routine:**

Stronglifts 5x5 and then progressed into doing stronglifts with 3x5 about 3 months in. I stopped doing Rows for some reason about that time as well but I've started them again.

I've added some accessory work over the last two months. Mainly Curls, Ab Wheel, Dips, Shrugs, Dumbell Flys, Lat Raises. I group them so I do 2 or 3 at the end of the Monday/Wednesday/Friday workouts.

I also bike a lot. It's not on any set routine. Sometimes I wouldn't bike at all during the week and other times I'd bike to work every day. 

**Going forward:**

I definitely need to work on my bench and overhead press in terms of lift numbers. Aesthetically I'd like to mainly focus on my lacking chest

**Thanks**

Thanks everyone on this subreddit for completely redefining what I thought a reasonable goal even was! You guys are great. It was posts like this that inspired me in the first place

The one thing I have learned is that I could have probably made a lot more progress if I was more strict with my diet and routine. Work caused me to have to take multiple weeks off in a row and sometimes I was lazy and didn't put in the effort I should have. You definitely get out what you put in

Height: 5’9.5”

Age: 24
Starting Weight March 5th 2012: 185lbs

Day before the Photo shoot July 17th 2012: 150 lbs

Skin fold Measurements July 17th 2012 (in mm):

		Triceps – 3.6
		Abdominal – 7
		Subscapular – 7
		Thigh – 7.2
		Chest – 2.2
		Calf – 4.1
		Maxillary - 4.2
		Bicep – 2.2
		Lower Back – 6.4
		Suprailiac – 3.7 
		Parrillo Caliper Method – 7.8% Body Fat

Diet: 

I have tried two approaches in dieting
 
I ate 1.2 g/lb of protein and gradually increased to 1.5 g/lb as I crept closer to my goal. I kept my fat at 20% and carbohydrates made up the remaining calories. My calories were kept at 14 calories/lb and I ate 6 times a day.

For major protein sources I consumed chicken breast, brown rice, and fruit (mostly bananas). My fat sources were almonds and natural peanut butter. My vegetable consumption was not limited so I was to able to eat as much as I wanted.

I had hot sauce and mustard for condiments. No ketchup the entire time. No refined carbohydrates! However

Three weeks out from my photo shoot I stopped having cheat meals. Two weeks out I started to gradually increase my water consumption to 7-8L per day. 7 Days out I stopped having all spices (salt

Supplements: 

Pre Workout – EC Stack (Ephedrine 24mg, Taurine, Beta-Alanine.

Post Workout – 2 scoops protein (approx 50g protein), 1 or 2 bananas.

Water Drop – PVL Watertight for 10 days.


Training: 

Day 1 – Chest/Tri

Day 2 – Back/Bi/Core

Day 3 – Quads/Hamstrings

Day 4 – Shoulders

Day 5 – Full Body Recovery/Core

Day 6 – Cardio (7 km outdoor run or elliptical/bike for 45mins)

Day 7 – Rest

Conclusion: Overall I'm extremely happy with the results and I finally have the confidence now to do a competition!

**Edit1: Working through the comments everybody and answering questions. I'm trying to make the best responses possible. Ask Away!**

**Edit2**: Ab Routine: 2 cycles

*High incline ab crunch with weight behind head x15

*High incline leg raise and lift bum

*Oblique crunch on oblique bench with weight x15 on each side

*Ab Roller x 15

*Side to side oblique crunch with legs up with weight x25

Really hard to describe the names

**Edit3**: Water Drop/Carb Depletion:

The idea with the depletion is to deplete your body of its glycogen stores both in the liver and muscle. I did this for 3 days

By doing this you create an environment where your body is basically starving for carbs. When you carb load (approximately 50% more carbs then usual) your body responds by super saturating the muscles with glycogen therefore making you look harder and fuller. You also drop your water intake at this time to promote water flowing into your muscle with the glycogen and releasing the water from under your skin.

so 3 weeks out increase water to 6-8L.

6 days out - carb depletion

5 days out - carb depletion

4 days out - carb depletion

3 days out - carb load

2 days out - carb load

1 days out - carb load

day of photoshoot- no water

The water cycling is to trick your body to drop your water from under your skin to make you tight and ripped. I also took a diuretic to lose as much water as possible.

**Edit4**
Sample Day 1 sets x reps

BB Bench Press 5x8 or 5x5

DB Incline Bench Press 4-5x6-8

Incline DB Fly 3x10

Flat DB Fly 3x10

Cable Rope Tri Extension 5x8

Cable Single Arm Tri Extension or Cable Rope Overhead Tri Extension (Cable French Press)  3x8-10

I workout approximately 90 mins on lifting days.

Switch up the exercises or rep ranges once and while  (at least every 8 weeks) for periodization. 


**Edit5 Added new images to the album!** 

**Edit6** Sample Meals

my breakfast shake is delicious and easy. 1 scoop vanilla protein


Also my dinner was 150 grams of chicken, and 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. throw some mustard in there and hot sauce. Microwave. The liquid in the cottage cheese makes a nice sauce!


Homemade granola was my snack. 1/3 cup of raisins

**I find simple foods are generally the healthiest like, rice, almonds. Little or no cooking involved and they will nourish your body. Don't spend too much time making complicated food because it will become a chore and monotonous. Make it easy to eat so that its harder to cheat.**

**Edit 7** THE EC STACK
This is taken directly from an essay I wrote last semester:

Ephedra/Ephedrine: “Ephedra increases the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine [which] stimulates [the] α- and β- andrenergic receptors” (Manore, heart rate, and alertness (Manore, 2012, p. 4). It also has some appetite suppressing qualities. When taking both ephedra and caffeine together they work synergistically to promote increased fat oxidization then taking them separately (Manore, 2012, p. 5). “Two double-blind RCTs lasting 6-9 months reported greater weight loss (~3-5kg) and fat loss (~1.5-4.3kg) with ephedrine alkaloids (40-90mg/day) and caffeine (100-192mg/day) versus a placebo in overweight or obese individuals” (Manore, p. 5).

Manore, 139-154.

**Edit8** Full Body Recovery

Super Set 1: No break between exercises, 90-120 sec rest

* DB Row

* Air Squat

* DB Bench Press


Super Set 2: No break between exercises, 90-120 sec rest

* BB Military Press (press from front then press from back = 1 rep)

* BB Squat (I use same weight from military press)

* Pull Ups or Chin Ups if you can (lat pull down if not)


Super Set 3: No break between exercises, 90-120 sec rest

* Rope Tri Extension

* DB Standing Bicep Curl (strict

* DB Side Raise

Then finish with some core work!

Notes: Choose weight that will only give a minimal burn (if at all). This workout is designed to give a pump and blood flow to all the muscle groups in your body to promote recovery. This is NOT a muscle building routine. Enjoy this workout it is supposed to be fun and give you a great pump!

1352897789.0,136g31,"Shoulder stability and rotator cuff exercises for prevention, treatment of shoulder pain and a solid foundation for pressing",BrFT,999,240,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/136g31/shoulder_stability_and_rotator_cuff_exercises_for/
A deeper look at the risk factors that contribute to the development of rotator cuff tendinopathy explains why specific exercises play a crucial role in the treatment and prevention. Prevention is the most effective treatment. I will also discuss how these preventive shoulder stability exercises enhance shoulder function and provide a strong foundation to build a powerful press.   


Risk factors    

The risk factors that contribute to the development of a rotator cuff tendon injury are both overuse (regular overhead lifting; shoulder impingement) and underuse (tendon degeneration).    
   
1.	Excessive overhead lifting and overhead sports are important factors contributing to rotator cuff issues. There is a difference in fibre cross-sectional area between the different layers of the supraspinatus tendon (Nakajima
2.	Impingement: Before attaching to the head of the humerus the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles pass underneath a bony roof (the acromion, the supraspinatus tendon can get compressed against the acromion, leading to degeneration of the tendon and tendonitis (Luo et al. 1998).      
3.	Underuse: The supraspinatus tendon is prone to degenerative changes. The supraspinatus tendon is poorly vascularized (Rathbun


Treatment    

The mainstays of treatment include rest
There are two problems with this traditional treatment approach. 
         
1.	Several studies demonstrate little or no inflammation is actually present in tendons exposed to overuse (Kahn et al. 1999
2.	The changes that occur in tendons in response to overuse are degeneration due to an altered tendon remodelling process (constant degradation and rebuilding of tendon tissue) and disorganization of collagen fibres (Kahn et al. 1999
3.	Because of the poor blood circulation of the supraspinatus tendon and low metabolic activity of the tendon cells it will take forever for the tendon to heal while resting. Inactivity will also cause the tendon to further degenerate. 

Treatment for rotator cuff disorders should always consist of rotator cuff strengthening exercises and exercises to enhance scapulothoracic stability. Research shows that these exercises are effective to reduce pain and strengthen and recondition the rotator cuff tendons.  Exercise increases blood circulation in the tendons of the muscles that are exercised, Kjaer et al. 2000, Langberg et al. 1998).     
Rotator cuff exercises will also improve shoulder function and prevent rotator cuff impingement. A strong rotator cuff widens the subacromial space during shoulder flexion and abduction and prevents rub of the rotator cuff tendons against the acromion (Thompson 2010).           


Train the shoulder as a unit    

The shoulder complex consists off two joints: the scapulathoracic joint (joint formed by ribcage and shoulder blade) and the glenohumeral joint (joint formed by shoulder blade and upper arm).     
To effectively stabilise the shoulder
Good balance and proper activation of the scapular muscles will result in proper scapular motion during the vertical or horizontal press. Proper scapular mechanics enable the rotator cuff muscles to contract close to their ideal length

Shoulder instability and concurrent rotator cuff tendonitis or tears are often related to a loss of function of the scapulathoracic joint. A common imbalance in people that often lift overhead is a strong upper part of the trapezius
The upper part of the trapezius is, Cuban press) are not effective and are likely causing the issues they are trying to fix.      

       
Shoulder stability routine for treatment and prevention    

A shoulder stability routine for the acute phase of rotator cuff related shoulder pain:        

1. [Side-lying external shoulder rotation](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/side-lying-external-shoulder-rotation) 3 x 15 reps@ (@ means each side)     
2. [Dumbbell reverse flies]( http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/dumbbell-reverse-flies) 3 x 15 reps        

These exercises primarily focus on the subscapularis, it should be possible to carry out these exercises without pain.   
These exercises also promote lower and middle trapezius activation with minimal activity in the upper trapezius

A shoulder stability routine for the sub-acute phase or for prevention:   
     
1. [Row-external rotation-press]( http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/row-external-rotation-press) 3 x 15 reps@ (@ means each side)      
2. [YMCA](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/ymca-on-stability-ball)  3 x 8-14 reps (add 2 reps/week, but add 1-2 lbs.)     
3. [Horizontal shoulder abduction](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/horizontal-shoulder-abduction)   2 x 15-20 reps@      
4. [Inverse row](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/inverse-row) 3 x 10 reps + 1 set to failure     

These shoulder stability routines you can add to your workout. Focus in the beginning a lot on horizontal pull exercises and shoulder stability exercises.     
Once you go back to lifting normal
A good alternative for bench press are push-ups. Push-ups promote the co-contraction of the rotator cuff musculature. Push-ups also activate the serratus anterior muscle more compared to the bench press. Because the scapula is not supported by the bench during the push-up

1333647002.0,ruwj8,Let's clear up this caffeine + creatine bro-science.,MaybiusStrip,962,204,147,"Almost every day I see someone spout out something along the lines of: ""You can take creatine and caffeine as long as it's not the same time!"" This misinformation is even on the usually factual [examine.com](http://examine.com/faq/does-caffeine-counteract-creatine.html): ""Caffeine can counteract creatine when coingested at the same time.""

Let’s make something clear

All of this brouhaha (or rather

Let’s actually read the damn thing, protocol C refers to the creatine + caffeine group (protocol B was the control group).

""During protocol A the subjects were administered creatine supplements for 6 days (days 2-7). They ingested a total of 0.5 g creatine monoydrate per kilogram body weight per day

“Protocol C was similar to protocol A. However, and 7, in addition to the creatine supplements, the subjects were administered a **single dose** of 5mg caffeine x kg body wt x day. Caffeine capsules were ingested after breakfast.""

Is the timing of co-ingesting caffeine and creatine counteracting the effects of creatine an interesting hypothesis based on this study? Ehh

So what does this study actually find?

- At the end of the six days

- Despite this

Quite frankly

-	Only looks at one 6 day loading period
-	They conclude that their study “demonstrates creatine loading to increase PCr concentration in skeletal muscle. This is accompanied by accelerated recovery of muscle contractile capacity during the rest episodes of high-intensity intermittent exercise. The ergogenic action of creatine loading is counteracted by caffeine.” *But then who was muscle PCr?!?!*
-	The study only focuses on one exercise
-	The sample size is **nine dudes**
-	It’s one fucking study

The big update that we’ve been working towards for the past 6 months or so.

[The blog post goes into details](http://examine.com/blog/weve-solved-supplement-confusion/)

(Turns out a lot of people are threatened by the full summary when there aren't blue quote boxes; go figure... adding text to the matrix does a lot in consolidating information)

There is a bit of subjectiveness to it - minor vs notable vs strong is not easily quantified, an effect that is worth looking into but is not pharma-grade (for example, if supplement A has an antidepressant effect but despite being better than placebo and probably relevant it still performs less than valium as a reference compound).

I’m normally not one to pander

**Major supplemental Update: Fish Oil**

[Direct Link](http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/). I'm not really show how to approach this but I'll give it a go anywho; a wholly accurate Tl;Dr is impossibly difficult

- The omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is probably the ultimate deciding factor in the benefits of fish oil (excluding triglyceride reduction to be discussed). However, but they sort of work like hormones); the enzyme that releases them does not discriminate between either of them, so it will release whatever is stored and then the omega-3 eicosanoids do their thing (usually antiinflammatory and antioxidative) while the omega-6 stuff do their things (usually immunosupportive and inflammatory)

- The whole 'immunosuppressive' thing is somewhat unreliable

- B-cells (important in reacting to infections) seem to actually be supported with fish oil supplementation

- The triglyceride reducing effect of fish oil is highly reliable and highly supported (see the matrix; 100% consensus on 44 studies I think? That is *not* all of them

- HDL-C is increased somewhat reliably, just get a reliable source) appeared to reverse the increase in LDL-C

- The anti-depressive effects of fish oil are kinda sorta pharma grade (a bit less) *only* in severely depressed persons

- There is absolutely no concern with fish oil or any polyunsaturated fat causing lipid peroxidation in my opinion. Aside from DNA damage (the ultimate oxidative result we should be concerned with) not being present in human given fish oil under normal conditions, it is still theoretically possible you can absolutely superload fish oil and then do a marathon and induce some DNA damage, so don't do that

Overall

- Normalizing the ratio is likely the most relevant thing to do with fish oil

**Background:**

On June 3rd, I was pretty much wider than I was tall. I had always been overweight and thought that I was just always going to be stuck there. However, that morning, when I looked into the mirror I finally saw what was really there. We have a way of sometimes seeing past our physical appearance because we're ashamed and don't want to admit to ourselves that we have let ourselves fall that much. And right then and there, I decided I was done doing this to myself.



**Exercise:**

I started with P90X. I modified exercises as needed

After P90X, where I did a month or two of my own running to end of the year.

Around January first

I've since graduated from the workout videos


**Diet:**

I've probably done every single type of dieting in the book in the last 10 months, which slowly worked itself to around 1000 calories at times.

I've done keto off and on. I've found it's the best diet for suppressing appetite and making it very easy to continue living your life without feeling the stress from food.

I've also done periods of fasting. I add in 1-2 day fasts now every week or two, but I think it's something I'll just have to manage moving forward in my life.

I've also done up to 5 days at a time of Protein Sparing Modified Fasting


**Moving Forward:**

I want to lose another 10 lbs



**Notable Accomplishments Since Starting to Lose Weight:**

* Walked a half-marathon
* Ran a 5 mile race in under 50 minutes
* Ran a 5k in under 24 minutes


**Lifts (5rm):**

* Bench: 165 lbs
* Squats: 250 lbs
* Overhead Press: 110 lbs
* Deadlifts: 330 lbs
* Chinups/Pullups: 12 non-weighted


**Planned Events for this Year:**

* 100 mile bike ride
* Tough Mudder
* More 5ks

As for some stats, 31 years old, and did it over a period of about 2 years.  I'm 6'5, pants went from size 44 to 32.  Shirt size from 3x to large, and it would probably be medium except they're never long enough.

I did it by eating right and lifting weights.  I did some cardio here and there, which is how I lost the majority of the weight.  But low carb is not ideal for putting on muscle, which I'm now ready to do.  Currently doing Leangains which I've had great success with, since starting it my body weight hasn't moved much but I went from size 34 to 32 pants.  Plus, my weights in the gym are no longer stagnant, which they were for the majority of the time I was losing weight.  I still have a long way to go in that area.

 The one thing i can stress to those who are wanting to put on mass is compound movements. The 4 main ones I focused on were: squatting, and power cleaning.

1294256241.0,ewrr0,"Write-up on the dreaded anterior pelvic tilt or ""why does my stomach protrude"", and how to fix it",troublesome,963,244,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ewrr0/writeup_on_the_dreaded_anterior_pelvic_tilt_or/

Does the computer guy from [this](http://i.imgur.com/E7FIp.jpg) pic look like you? If so, or that your lower back is so arched that your stomach protrudes forward, giving you the “skinny gut”. People are under the mistaken impression that working out hard in the gym will fix this. Let’s make one thing clear - what you do in the gym only cements what you have. If you have bad posture, heavy lifting makes it worse. If you have good posture, heavy lifting makes it better. Of course there are exceptions to this, but for the majority of the population, that’s the norm. 

This post is about anterior pelvic tilt, look sideways in the mirror. does your butt stick out? Chances are that you have an anterior pelvic tilt.
I’m gonna break bad posture in 2 sections


Lower body:

The classic bad guys in APT are tight hip flexors coupled with a tight rectus femoris (quads) and lumbar erectors (lower back). The weakened muscles are the glute max, the glute max will not fire to its maximum capacity and to pick up for this slack, the adductor magnus and the hamstrings will be forced to step in. this leads to hamstring pulls and groin pulls. Have you ever heard of an athlete suffering from glute pulls?

Fixing this dysfunction takes some work:

1) Lengthen the hip flexors.  The [lunge stretch](http://i.imgur.com/L6OUQ.jpg) works best. Make sure that you’re moving at the hips and not the lower back. Squeeze the heck out of your butt of the leg that’s behind you. To enhance this stretch

2) Activate and strengthen the glutes. According to Bret Contreras 

3) Do NOT stretch the back via traditional flexion stretches like the toe touch stretch. Although it is a decent lumbar stretch

4) Strengthen the abs. Please do not do crunches. I cannot stress that enough. They work well, go on to more advanced variations. Let me make one thing clear with the plank. Your posture should be perfect and your knees should have a very slight bend in them.  You abs should be tight with a slight arch in the lower back and the butt should be squeezed. Imagine you have a coin between your cheeks and it should not drop. Squeeze the butt hard and that’s 50% of your problems solved right there. I cannot stress the importance of torso stability enough.



Other than these steps, [outer hips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWfnAUsYUTI&amp;feature=player_embedded)  and quads, along with the calves and peroneals.


A good warmup before a workout for lengthening and activating muscles would include:

1) Hip flexor stretching coupled with quadruped hip extensions and hip circles – 2x20 seconds of the lunge stretch followed by [this](http://www.youtube.com/user/PerformanceU#p/search/17/wH5inK4WKXo).

2) Foam rolling of the IT band followed by [clams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvxR5LoOu8Y)

3) 3x3 [hand walkouts](http://chadwaterbury.com/core-hand-walkout/)

4) A lot of people forget that one of the main functions of the glutes is to eccentrically stop the femur from internally rotating. This exercise (and most single leg exercises) work well to fix that. Don't let the knee cave in


this is a pretty good solution to a very common problem. it's pretty simplistic in it's approach. here are some links that may interest some people:

1343413567.0,x9chn,My transformation - 2 years of lifting,bigbird1989,954,236,308,"I know reddit loves a good transformation! My progress in just under 2 years.....

Before - I was a 13.5 stone student bum! Boozing and eating pretty much whatever I wanted
http://imgur.com/KkkDK

After - Two years later
http://imgur.com/o2iYG

Hopefully provide a bit of inspiration to fellow lifters and people dieting/training hard for summer! I am starting a fitness blog also so if you are interested in that PM me!

I'd be happy to answer any questions on diet/routine for people new to the game and maybe advice on fitting it in with a busy working schedule (i work the standard office 9-5)

Happy lifting guys

**EDIT:** 

Yikes guys sorry I didn't realise the detail I was supposed to provide when writing a post like this! I apologise! Thanks cleti for pointing this out!

To answer questions:
1)What routine/s did you follow? 
I have pretty much kept to the same routine throughout my 2 years of lifting

I change the exercises and weight regularly

**Monday**: Chest + Biceps (biceps have plenty of energy to be hit hard after chest)

I will do exercises such as flat bench press

My bicep routine consists of straight bar curls and then some kind of isolation movement (normally preacher curls

**Tuesday**: Legs

I like to do my quads and hamstrings on the same day

I ALWAYS start with squats

After squats I move on to really heavy leg press for about 15 or so reps

After this it will be leg extensions

Then I will begin my hamstring workout

**Wednesday** I will either rest or do cardio

**Thursday**: Shoulders and triceps. I like to start with heavy barbell/dumbbell shoulder press

I will then do lateral raises pretty instinctively
After my laterals I always throw in front raises for 2 sets and remain seated through these before moving onto triceps.

I always use dips in my tricep routine

**Friday**: Back. I always begin back with heavy deadlifts


**2)**Define ""sensible"" diet. Plenty of diets are sensible and work. What did you follow?
I'm ashamed to say it, when I wanted. I went from about 13.5 stone to 16 stone doing this but got really really fat! The good news is, with my gain in weight I gained strength also so eventually when i tightened up my diet I was able to strip fat and reveal the muscle underneath!

I try and hit around 4000 cals a day, where-as my carbohydrates are mainly from sweet potatos. I have one meal of brown rice a day but i get really really bored of it! I try to eat green vegetables where possible but sometimes I don't have time to steam these before work.....


**3)**Starting and ending height

Ok I started at about 13.5 stone and was 6'2

Now i'm at 15.5 stone, I have 27.5"" quads and my chest is about 45"" i think....and I can't measure round my shoulders myself! I'll get a friend to do it later....


 **4)** Starting and ending lifting stats. What numbers are you putting up in common lifts (squat, deadlift, chin ups, power cleans, rows, curls, etc)?

Ok I don't ever do 1 rep max lifts

On the flat bench press I normally work at about 120kg for 8-10 reps

Squats I am working at about 140kg for about 15 reps

Deadlifts - I love these

I have never done power cleans

Hopefully this has given you a little outline of my style of training and dieting

**EDIT NUMBER TWO READ THIS:** Wow

I have received a number of PMs regarding exact diet so I thought I'd give a kind of outline of what I'm eating day to day at the moment to help anyone out. Take this with a pinch of salt as sometimes I throw in or take out an extra bit of steak/carbs/chicken here depending on what is in the fridge

Hi mate

**Example Meal Plan**
So for breakfast I will have about 150g of Oat Bran with 330ml liquid egg whites from MyProtein

Meal 1 i will eat two hours later

Meal 2 I have two hours after that

Meal 3 I will have two hours after this

Meal 4 I will have pre-workout two hours later

Meal 5 - This will be postworkout shake. I use 3 scoops of pure whey protein and 1.5 scoops of dextrose. Take all my vitamins/glucosamine/codliver oil/HMB/BCAAs/L-arginine straight after a workout.

Meal 6 - I count this as a meal

Meal 7 - two hours later I will eat about 400g of tesco cottage cheese and two generous tablespoons of peanut butter.

I pretty much rinse and repeat this for workout days

**More Progress Pics:**
I got a few PMs asking about more progress pics too so thought I'd put them on here so you guys can see whats going on. I've had to trawl through some awful photos for these so take a look......


So here is another picture of 'before' where I was out partying all the time
http://imgur.com/N2oik

Here is a picture after spending about 8 months eating pretty much whatever I wanted, but I was smooth and lacked definition)
http://imgur.com/66r2L

I like this photo because it was taken a few days after I really began paying attention to my diet and I began to take a shape I liked (slim waist
http://imgur.com/A3GsG

And here is one taken at the gym not too long after that when I had a pump on. I remember this stage because people would start to comment on my physique (I can't remember exact dates!)
http://imgur.com/mp2gq

And here is quite an arty one taken off my friends blog
http://imgur.com/e3Wx2

Hopefully these will give you some more insight into the steps this transformation has taken!

**Final word on steroids:** I knew a lot of people would instantly assume steroid usage - thats fine

* My father was a bodybuilder and competed in a national competiton - NEVER underestimate genetic ability to gain/lose weight in bodybuilding. I am lucky and can pretty much eat whatever I want whilst maintaining a lean

* These pictures are the two most EXTREME before and after photos I could find. The lighting on the recent one is good

* My diet is flat out consistent. I drink probably once every two months, and I normally do cardio after weights at the moment too. I 100% attribute my physiques progress to keeping a consistent diet, consistant routine and sticking with it, and making TINY adjustments to change certain areas.  Sleep is also real important, I try and get about 8 hours a night every night.

Hope this sheds some light on my situation. I do have a video fitness blog with diet advice/training on it

**TL:DR - ** Transformed my body in two years

I went to see my doctor and got a full blood test. She called me yesterday and confirmed that I have type II diabetes. 

I am an otherwise healthy person, sugar or pasta. The best part of it is that I can have meat, lots and lots of meat I have had since then.

Hopefully this post serves as inspiration to you all. If you are/have:



Constantly thirsty
Constantly hungry
Frequent urination
Have dry lips
Have small cuts that don't heal for a long time
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Then you better see your doctor. At the very least


Thanks to this subreddit


Edit: some people are asking if they could be diabetic if they have one or more of these symptoms. While chances are high that if you have all of these symptoms, which decides the likeliness that a person will get diabetes and hey include: 

    Bad diet
    Sedimentary (aka sedantary) lifestyle 
    Genetics (more likely if you have siblings with the disease)
    Climate (colder climates is more likely to help develop diabetes)
    Some diseases of the pancreas can also contribute
    
So if you have the symptoms and you also fit in the risk factors

While we are here

    Type I (""juvenile-onset"" - about 10% of people with diabetes) 
         Problem with the pancreas - doesn't make any or enough insulin
         Requires insulin shots
    Type II (""adult-onset"" - about 90% of people with diabetes)
         Problem with cells - cells become insulin resistant 
         Can be treated with proper diet and exercise

**TL;DR here's the album http://imgur.com/a/erKPU

Started as a BMI = 30 teenager. Got called fat etc. Started lifting

First we'll do the basics. 

**Stats:**

- Weight: 190lbs.
- Age: 26
- Sex: Male
- Height: 6'1""
- I'd place my bodyfat @ 9%. 
- Squat 375

**Bulking Routine:**

[This.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.ca/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html)

Also see [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1bblg3/gzcl_method_report_3_months_in_365290485/)

- I use the second bench day to focus on shoulder presses and shrugs.

- I usually add an arms day on sundays. I do a lot of mobility work - foam rolling

- I focus on volume on the second legs day - easier on my knee

- I do calves every day. 

**Cutting Routine:**

- Essentially [this.](http://www.leangains.com/2008/12/reverse-pyramid-revisited.html). Four days a week.

- Monday: Legs; Wednesday: Chest; Friday: deads/back; Saturday: shoulders/mobility.

**Diet**

- I wave my calories and carbs. So I'll calculate my TDEE

- When I bulk I eat breakfast

- My staples ARE: chicken (lean and whole), protein shakes. Onions, bags of frozen veggies, brussel sprouts, mushrooms. Grapefruits, bananas, oats

- The only cardio I do = walking where I need to go

**Problems I ran into**

- Being afraid of gaining fat. This seriously limited my progress once I started taking lifting seriously. I had been soft

- Not programming. **I wasted so much time.** So much time.

- Not eating enough protein. More time wasted. It took me awhile to start eating a lot of meat and etc. When I did (1g/lb bodyweight) gains came so much more easily.

- Maxing every fucking time I stepped in the gym. I had an ego for a bit. I didn't want strangers at the gym to think I was weak. I wanted to move the big weight every time. I don't care any more

- Damaging my left knee because of the above. I was embarrassed that my squat was so poor relative to the rest of me. I wouldn't squat as light as I needed. My right knee was stronger than my left

- Going too hard when I got overexcited and doing too much

- Not sleeping enough. 6hrs &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; the 10hrs I get now. I go to bed at like 9pm most nights and feel awesome. 

**Why I Lift**

Because I love it as an activity. It's all about patience, planning, tweaking. Endlessly interesting. I don't do it for the aesthetics though I do like being relatively lean and being able to see all my abs. I used to tell myself I just had fat on me, and it was my genetics, and that was that. It made perfect sense at the time. 

Lifting changed my life. Funny thing is

I wasted years fucking around

When I started getting swole - actually swole - everyone on earth treated me differently. Checkout people (especially women) were nicer. I became more confident and more assertive *simply as a result of people deferring to me more often.* Earlier this year I literally *wore a dress out to the bar* and guys... got the fuck out of my way. Not as a joke

Around July of last year, how do I get shoulders like that, do I just have good genetics (no). 

I also started getting the steroid accusations :( One time some guys in a car yelled it at me as I stood on a street corner /swoleacceptancesolidaritylolololololo. 

**Other stuff**

In preparation for this thread, I got the pump, went downstairs, looked at myself, and I wasn't happy. 

It was really fucked up.

I wasn't having fun in the gym. I didn't like it. So I went upstairs, put on my hoodie and belt and started ripping weight. I had completely stomped on the prep I'd done for progress pictures, but I was happy again. I took the March 2013 pictures later on, post-easter feasting. 

I learned though I like looking nice, I lift because I like being a 'big, bad, weight-ripping motherfucker.'

(even though I'm not that big or bad : / )

----

Hey everyone

Swole Society is an idea that I've been tossing around in my head for the longest time

I've spent a lot of time taking things up to this point, creating a sizing chart, building relationships with manufacturers and fabric suppliers, working with designers and pattern graders, building out the web site, getting everything set up. I took it as far as I could (with all the money I had) before getting it to this point. So far the response has been great. Are things exactly how I want them? Not exactly, but the campaign is growing and there will be updates to show progress as it moves along.

It's now day 3 of the campaign and we've already raised $1400. There's a statistic on the Internet that says when a kickstarter campaign gets to 30% funding

Please watch the video and see if you're interested. If you like the idea consider making a pledge to receive our first batch of shirts that will be shipping out mid-January. Community involvement is probably the most important aspect of a successful campaign.

Thanks for reading!

Wow. It's only 8PM and we're just shy of the 30% goal. I didn't think it would happen so fast but I put it out there and you all delivered. The campaign is growing and improving continuously. So make sure you keep tabs on it and watch it change and grow as the campaign continues. We still have 20+ days to go

* If I forget which set I'm on, I have to assume it's two. Sometimes, when I'm on my last set, I realize that I was wrong, but I still make it a point not to argue with my rule. It also keeps me honest. 

* I count by fives or less. So, 1-2-3-4-5. If I go nine, I go three by three by three. I don't know why, but it feels easier to do this way. Yes, I know it makes no sense. 

* If doing indoor cardio, and I get bored. With no clock to look at, I tend to let my mind drift, and it makes it more enjoyable. 

* When lifting

* When using barbells, I'll sometimes use a 25 plus two 10s. Again, I don't know why, but it feels more doable. I also tell myself that if I max, I can always take off a smaller one (though this rarely happens).

**Body weight**

* Starting: 163 lbs
* After about eight months on SS: 168 lbs - 170 lbs
* Post cut: 156 lbs


Like the title states

My lifts when starting were as follows (taken from my journal):

**3x5 Working weights (start):**

* Squat: 175 lbs
* Bench: 145 lbs
* Deadlift: 185 lbs (1x5 per SS)
* Press: 75 lbs
* Power cleans: 75 lbs (5x3 per SS

**Currently (as of last week) my lifts (also 3x5 working weights) are:**

* Squat: 290 lbs
* Bench: 205 lbs
* Dead: 345 lbs (1x5)
* Press: 125 lbs
* Power clean: 175 lbs (5x3)

**Current 1RM**

* Squat: 350 lbs
* Bench: 230 lbs
* Deadlift: 420 lbs
* Press: 135 lbs
* Power clean: 205 lbs

During this time I also did the accessory lifts including alternating between pull ups and pendlay rows on ""B"" days and adding dips and incline dumbbell bench on ""A"" days. 

In addition

**Reprogramming**

About three months ago

**Day A**

* Squat: see below
* Bench: 3x5
* Deadlift: 1x5
* Incline dumbbell press: 3x8

**Day B**

* Squat: see below
* Press: 3x5
* Power cleans: 5x3
* Pull ups/pendlay rows: 3x10/3x8
* Dumbbell shoulder press (sitting): 3x8

I'm still squatting three days a week, and 5x3 heavy low-bar on Fridays. I'm also switching to high-bar every other week to transition into olympic lifting.

**Diet**

I've never had a problem eating. I used to be quite overweight in high school and college so I've kept my appetite up this whole time. Initially

I did take protein powder (Muscle Milk, steamed, boiled), salad with Newman's dressing (caesar or oil/vinegar), steak, tofu, eggs

**Cutting**

About two months ago I decided to cut. I was satisfied with my strength gains and want see what I would look like with lower body fat. Before I started my cut I was around 168-170 lbs. I'm now 156 lbs

Picture before I started cutting: http://imgur.com/Nl6QP

To do this, one chicken sausage link, one tomato, and coffee. My lunch is typically a salad at work and dinner is another salad (lots of greens, roasted chicken breast, avocado, tomato) and soup. 

I also started to do some ab work during this time. I'd never done sit-ups or any ab work before because I read it was unnecessary. Nevertheless

I've managed to keep my lifts constant and even progressed in squats

**The Future**

I want to compete in a powerlifting competition next year. Haven't chose a weight class yet but I'm leaning towards 152 lbs. I've also dabbled in olympic weightlifting and want to get more into that as well. Currently I am snatching 135 lbs and clean and jerking 185 lbs

This was me about 6 months ago. My friends at the time were upset that they (having been working out for many more years than me) can't even hardly get into the position. Still getting stronger, but I'll take what I can get haha

Current weight: 160

Gender: Male

I started working out for entirely vain reasons. We won a trip to Disney World from a TV station and my wife and I were worried they would want to videotape us for commercials or something. Literally

Now, but I'm probably in the best shape of my life right now. I know I still have a long way to go, but I'm doing this for me now and not just so I look better.

How I did it:

First and foremost

I was eating WAY more than any human being needed to. My wife works in the evenings

Once I learned to control my eating (which was not even remotely easy)

We took the time to look at our diet and what we needed to cut out. We still indulge in take-out

I started walking on the treadmill everyday. Soon, I'm running ten miles a day. I'm getting ready for my first race in just a few weeks.

If you had asked me about running one year ago

Now, I just decided to run another five miles.

I'm also weightlifting 4-5 times a week. I do 4 sets of 4 exercises usually with 10 reps per set. The exercises depend on which muscle group I'm targeting that day. I try to keep it varied as much as I can with my home equipment.

I owe a lot of it to you guys. I have found a lot of great ideas on here. New exercises or just plain motivation. The FAQ alone set me straight about a lot of things.

Thank you.

&gt;Bottom line for your readers: Everybody knows the basics

So many of you come in with questions

Just pick a program and go. Just make some simple dietary changes (fewer or no processed foods, then make sure you get rest between workouts. That alone is more than what 90-95% of the population does for their health, and will give you results if you follow the form of a given workout and stick to it with discipline.

1315241064.0,k5gms,An everyday workout/warmup that you can use to fix your postural dysfunction,troublesome,910,247,182,"If you haven’t already, [this is a classic example of an APT](http://images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20080320/293.kardashian.kim.032008.jpg). The upper body is not in too much of a hunch but the shoulders will slump forward and will stay more over the toes. The stomach will protrude towards the floor a bit

**Note: A bit of APT is normal for people. In fact it’s optimal. All top level athletes will have a degree of APT because it puts the glutes into a more advantageous position to exert force.**

Ok now that that’s out of the way, it’ll make it better. Bad posture will get worse. So make sure that when you’re lifting weights, you go through the full range of motion and don’t sell yourself short by lifting more than you can handle for less ROM. You’ll thank me later.


**Circuit for APT**

1.	[Hip flexor stretch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hQSJVIN3c) - 2 x 20 seconds (if you can’t do the bent knee version

2.	[Cook hip bridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4I9F9rIqwM) – 2x12 each side (Make sure your movements are slow and controlled. Really focus on squeezing your glute and pushing through your heel)

3.	[Clams](http://www.mikereinold.com/2011/04/the-hip-external-rotation-clamshell-exercise.html) – 2x8 each side

4.	[Planks](http://www.wannabebig.com/training/general-physical-preparedness-core-strength-and-conditioning/plank-progressions-for-killer-abs/) (1x40 seconds) or [Dead Bugs](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/core_training_for_smart_folks) (3x8 each side)

5.	[Thoracic extensions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICtEOwA3r_U&amp;feature=player_embedded) -2x 12

Very important: brace your abs and glutes throughout the stretches in this. If your lower back gets tight after these exercises

**Circuit for PPT**

1.	[Hamstring stretch](http://www.velogirls.com/resources/publications/stretching101/lying_hamstring.jpg) -2 x 20 seconds (Roll up a hand towel and place it under your lower back in order to create a natural arch in the back. In fact for every stretch where you’re lying down

2.	I don’t have a video for this so I’ll try to explain it. Lie down with your legs straight, raise one leg up as high as you can. Stop when you feel your back pressing into the fingers, and return down to the starting position. Go controlled and. Make sure that the toes of both legs are pointing towards the ceiling and it should be a straight up and down motion. I see too many people cheat by turning the toes out. 2 x 12 each leg

3.	[Cat/Camel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXRsjICsGnc) – 1x8 (Don’t force the stretch

4.	[Clams](http://www.mikereinold.com/2011/04/the-hip-external-rotation-clamshell-exercise.html) – 2x8 each side

5.	[Thoracic extensions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICtEOwA3r_U&amp;feature=player_embedded) -2x 12

6.	[Underhand Band pull aparts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpy2RSXA8dU) – 2x12 (Hold it with an underhand grip though

7.	[Plank](http://www.wannabebig.com/training/general-physical-preparedness-core-strength-and-conditioning/plank-progressions-for-killer-abs/) – 3x40 seconds

Go through your [normal warm-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ezlfn/repost_how_to_warmup_effectively_lift_more_for/) after this to raise core body temperature and some joint mobility/dynamic mobility work to get some synovial fluids into the joints. Yes it will extend your warm-up but if you have a dysfunction

On a side note, deadlifting and overhead pressing. This can put a lot of pressure on the tendons and ligaments in the spine and create worse back problems. Fix your PPT first then come back to two legged weightlifting. In the meantime you can work on single leg work. It doesn’t put as much pressure on the discs and you can get insanely strong.

Also

These circuits are light enough to be followed everyday and for a warmup. Thanks for reading,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,,t3_k5gms

I decided to put a lower body shot in there although it isn't very impressive so no one has to ask but I find it difficult to build size in the legs with bwf. when I go to college next year (Aus) I will be using the gym as well as body weight and then move on to what I deem fit from there.

The pics were taken over the course of a week so some of the images have the face cut out and some don't.

So far I have stuck almost exclusively to Bodyweight exercise however sometimes with the added resistance of dumbbells/weighted pull-ups.

**Stats**

11KM (6.8Miles) - 49:26

Pull Ups - 30

Push ups - 70

Raised L sit - 35 seconds

Muscle Ups - 6

Squats - 250-300 depending on the day

Height - 175 CM (5 foot 9)

Weight - 64kg (141Pounds)

A year and a half ago I joined my school's Full On Fitness class for 15-16 yr olds and stuck to a program 5 days a week 80 minutes a day and these so far are my results

I will be going to bed just after posting this but will answer all (most) questions/advice/criticism when I get up before/during school.

**Edit:** It is 7:42 AM where I am so I'll type my routine out when I get to school in first period or I will miss the bus. The response I have gotten to this was actually overwhelming; When I woke up I was feeling stress/nervous for today due to teenage reasons but I feel ecstatic now.  

**Edit2: My Routine**

**Sunday:** Rest

**Monday:**

 Hard Circuit due to an easy weekend. tends to look like;

2 KM run from school to the park

10x Pull Up

30x Deep Squat

25x Push Up

30x Sit Up

20x Dips on Parallel Bars

25x Lunges Each Side

5 sets of this then a 2km run back to school and I usually get into a pull up competition with a few others which progresses to around 40-50 before class ends.

**Tuesday:**

 Long distance run

**Wednesday:** Small Aerobic Circuit

5x Pull-ups

10x Squats, dips, Calf-raises, Sit Ups.

In this circuit there is no rest between exercises and a 1.5KM run after each set

**Thursday:**

Near our school we have a thing called the Trugga track.

1.5KM run from school to the base of the track. 3KM to the top and 3KM back down. It is basically a very steep muddy hill with a stair case built in that leads to the top. I am yet to run the entire thing including there and back.

**Friday:**

Repeat of Monday or Wednesday depending on how I am feeling.

**Saturday:** 

Rest

Each session lasts for 80 minutes apart from Wednesdays. Monday and Tuesday nights I have an Intermediate and Advanced Muay Thai class that last 90 minutes.

I started a year and a half ago at around 5 Pull-ups

I don't see the point of Cutting/Bulking as all I see are complaints on losing your strength in order to look better. I eat as if I am on a bulk but exercise as if I'm doing both in order to maintain performance year round.

Hi, meaning that I could run a few miles without much effort, but I was still pretty scrawny and I wanted to change that. Then I found fittit, and my world changed. I learned a crapload about exercise and physiology, and I implemented what I learned in the gym.

I started at about 160 or so pounds, I pretty much just ate whatever I could get my hands on, making sure that I had a bunch of protein. My weight topped out at 170 a few months, and from there I decided to cut back down in preparation for summer. I've been cutting for the past month and a half and now I'm back down to 157.

You will probably notice a conspicuous lack of decent leg exercises, I know - this is why I don't have leg pics lol). I don't look disproportionate, but one of my goals for the end of the summer when I start bulking again is to go hard on my legs, mostly because I think it will help with my posture and I want to feel more stable when I walk. My goal for this time next year is to gain about twelve pounds of muscle, most of which I hope to be on my arms, legs, and right pec because there's a bit of an imbalance there. We'll see.

Anywho

**Bent-Over Dumbbell Rows - 85 lbs - 3x10** while bulking (while cutting I've found that I've been decreasing the number of reps in each set

**Dumbell Chest Press - 40 lbs per DB - 3x10**

**Planks - BW - 3 sets

**Hip Thrusts - BW - 3x25**

**Roman Chair - BW - 2x20**

**Face Pulls - 90lbs - 3x10**

**Calf Raises (machine) - 250 lbs - 3x10**

**Sitting Row Machine - 120lbs - 3x10**


I usually end my workouts by doing wide-grip pull-ups to failure

Thanks again

Edit: I'm 5'10"".
Edit Número Dos:
While cutting, right now I usually have a protein shake with breakfast, perhaps with fried eggs if its a workout day. Around mid morning I'll have a protein bar to keep my calorie::protein ratio up (I figure I should have about one gram of protein for every 13 calories, and since I like carbalicious dinners I go heavy on the protein in the morning). For lunch I'll usually have chicken with a vegetable, I'm partial to peppers and onions. I also make a mean chili, which is a great low-cal, high-protein meal. For dinner I'll usually have some meat/carb/veggie combo. Healthy Choice meals are usually pretty good, Taco Bell's soft chicken fresco tacos have a pretty good calorie to protein ratio. I generally try to eat between 1850 and 2100 calories a day

Rhonda Smith used to be a bodybuilder. A pretty serious one. The 40-year-old Chandler mother of two competed in 2000 at the National Physique Committee event in Denver and again in 2010 in Chandler.

When she goes to the gym

During a recent trip to the gym at 24th Street and Baseline Road in south Phoenix

“He’s not happy. He asks to speak with me privately

Smith said the trainer told her that she wasn’t allowed to work out in groups and the women she was with were not allowed to coach each other. Smith said the trainer told her she could face a lawsuit if the club found out she was providing instruction for her friends.

“We (me and my friends) are there for the same purpose, to provide instruction,” Smith said. “If my form is wrong, I expect them to tell me, if their form is wrong, I will correct them as well.”

Smith complained to a gym manager

The corporate representative and the gym manager confirmed what the trainer had originally told Smith. LA Fitness does not allow its members to coach or train each other. Language outlining that rule is written in the standard LA Fitness contract. The company also told Smith that if she continued the practice

Smith said she was not charging any of the women for training sessions. She believes LA Fitness’ goal is to get its members to pay for coaching from the gym’s personal trainers. “That point was clearly made by the trainer and the woman from headquarters

1375916302.0,1jx12m,Today I had an accident in the squat rack that didn't involve shitting myself,tkfa,1044,403,442,"So I've read all sorts of stories on here about people shitting themselves in the squat rack and I still don't understand how. In any case

I've been doing SS for a month or so, lately when I do squats and deadlifts, the tension in my core sometimes pops the top button of my shorts open. But I'd kind of got used to this.

Anyway, today I ended up there while it was almost full (I train at a large commercial gym - there were probably 50+ people on the floor). Fortunately everyone at my gym is a bit of pussy and I'm the only one that squats, so the rack was free immediately. However, it's also worth mentioning that due to the hecticness of my day, I forgot to bring a spare pair of underwear. So I made the choice to go commando during the session in order to have them clean for afterwards.

I did my warm up and then started my first heavy squat set. Went really well, so not that much, but I still feel pretty good about it, especially in comparison to how I feel about the rest of this story). Took a break and then went for set 2. About 3 reps in, I felt a sort of tear...

Just to briefly explain, so literally everyone would have been able to see what went down.

So yeah, and then dropped to the floor to cover my tracks. I then thought about what to do.

It so happened that I had a spare pair of shorts back in the locker room, I got up and quickly made my way to the locker room, where upon further inspection I discovered that actually the hole was so big that I would have definitely been giving people a further opportunity to inspect my nethers.

Anyway

Anyway

tl;dr: Squats didn't solve all my problems.

Edit: So I took some pictures of the shorts this morning.

Cardio:  5km runs twice a week or so

Nutrition:

Was never really strict about this, but haven't had any supplements besides whey and a multi for the past 2 months or so.  I eat basically no vegetables or fruit... I eat lots of eggs, yogurt (both greek and the more junky kind), cheese, a metric shit-ton of fish, and lots of other meats as well.  I try to avoid bread and sugar, but will still eat whatever for the most part, at a rate of abouttt a pound a week.  

I think the biggest mistake I made early on was getting too caught up in the ""get big and strong"" mentality that dominates /r/fitness... Not that there's anything wrong with that, I HAVE gotten stronger, MUCH stronger, I just haven't been optimizing for max strength gain, and I'm happy with that.  I mean, I couldn't even do a pullup or a dip when I started this, and I've gotten my bench to 215 as well, and I think that's fine.

I've been on a -20/+20 (% of TDEE) recomp since July and only recently switched to a -20/+30 bulk

Some notes:

-I fasted for 14-16 hours every day (feeding window was 12:30 - 8:30 PM).

-I counted calories pretty meticulously for a few weeks or so when I started

-I kept protein to about .82 g/lb bodyweight. I replaced the missing protein (according to ifcalc) with carbs.

-I didn't really worry about macros that much; I made sure I was eating enough protein and then just focused on eating a lot more carbs on workout days and a lot more fats on rest days. I didn't worry about hitting 300g carbs/70g fat/etc (though I was pretty close to those targets on most days)

-I eat 2 meals a day on most days

-I have a sweet tooth and eat a lot of snacks - cookies, CHEESECAKE, etc.

-I made sure I ate a lot of vegetables and drank a lot of water every day (~128 oz). I recently started eating more fruits

-Workout routine: 

 Tuesday - Squat (RPT), BW Chinups)

 Thursday - Bench (RPT)

 Saturday - Deadlift (RPT)

 I recently started doing 10 minute cardio sessions on Sundays (for health

 All RPT exercises are done for 5

-Staple foods: naan, spinach, pomegranate seeds, cereal/milk, QUEST BARS (best snack), nonfat ham, low-calorie bagel thins/tortillas

-I drink green/black tea every morning. I don't take any other supplements (I need to start taking some vitamin d3

-I usually get around 7 hours of sleep/night (at least 6).

-I've probably had about 1 cheat meal every two weeks on average

I combined exercises from my coaches as well as from “leaked” work outs from collegiate and professional sprinters like Walter Dix, I suggest you do the opposite.  Also

**Workout One:**  Perform these in the 4-8 rep range (pick four of these lifts and alternate the other four every other lifting day). Snatch, Power shrugs (very heavy), One leg alternating hamstring curls, Seated calf raises, Hip abduction/adduction machine, Quad Extensions.

**Workout Two:**  Do this work out once or preferably twice a week, Lat pull downs, Bicep curls, Triceps extensions, Forearm curls, Stationary running with dumbbells(very light weight for 3x 1 min.), Core Work.

**Squat Program:**  You need to squat three times a week.  Period.  Do it on the days you do the leg workout above.  The percentages are from your one rep max before you start the program
Week 1:  80%x2x6, Week 2:  80%x4x6, 80%x2x6, 80%x5x6, Week 3:  80%x2x6, 80%x6x6, 80%x2x6, 80%x2x6, 80%x2x6

**Plyometrics:**  Do the following for 3 sets of 40 meters… Ankling, Double Cycles LL&amp;RR, Continuous L&amp;R cycles, Skips for height, Skips for distance, Straight leg bounds, One leg hops. Do the following for 3 sets of 30 reps… Tuck jumps, Rocket jumps (standing broad jump), One-leg reach (Set an object that is 12 inches tall two feet in front of you.  While standing on one leg with your knee bent reach for the object as fast as you can with the hand on the same side of the leg on the ground.  Sounds simple

**Agility:**  Alternate sprinting and jogging 15m each- 4 x 60m, Three cone drill (6 sets), Sprints- 6 x 10m, 5 x 20m, 4 x 30m, 3 x 40m, 2 x 50m

**Speed/Conditioning:**  Perform these like you would if you were running a race w/ FULL recovery in between (within ≈15% percent of your resting heart rate).  250m, 135m, 100m, 75m, 50m.

**Alternate Conditioning:**  Perform these at about 80 or 90 percent of your max speed.  Try to stay around 75% max heart rate.  8 x 150m

Weight loss chart (nearly daily): [here](http://i.imgur.com/5meC2.png). 


**If you’re interested – **

**On method:**
Calorie restriction. I also cut out bread, I tried to live as normally as possible and “cheated” when I was invited out to dinner or something. Also, all the big holidays (Christmas, important birthdays, Thanksgiving), I forgot all and gorged. It’s much more the everyday that matters. 


**On exercise: **
For the first few months I joined a Crossfit box. It was a great way to kick me back into a routine and jumpstart everything. I relocated and started doing yoga (vinyasa) fairly intensely. During this period I lost a steady 10lbs per months until I hit 145. From 145 until 134, gain more strength &amp; definition, and have 17-18% body fat. This might be a little leaner than the general fitit person’s ideal, but I like that look. Am considering cheat mode (if anyone has advice for women on this, it would be appreciated!).


**On food:**
For a point of reference I spend about $125-150/ week on food. This is by far my biggest expense. I can’t eat much
Breakfast- oats, coffee

Lunch- salad- chicken

Snacks - Fage 2% or 0%

Dinners – salad, chicken stews, etc

Desserts/ treats- fairly rare. Fage 2% or 0% with jams, Pinkberry with fruit, Skinny Cow ice cream cups 

Other foods I like – Kashi go lean cereal, chicken breasts, sashimi, earl grey tea, prosciutto, berries, melon, omlettes without cheese

Alcohol- cut out almost completely. Very occasionally straight whiskey with a beer. 


**General thoughts:**
I would not have known where to begin without r/fitness and after it started, but it helps to think long term. Some weeks are easier than others. I am still working on eating in moderation rather than just avoiding all carb or fat heavy foods.

Lots of running, advice, comments, or other input from you fitness pros?

EDIT: Wow

I see a lot of folks asking what I did to start out, chips, Cheetos, stuff like that. Coupled with a really sedentary lifestyle I gained like 80-90 lbs. in four years of college. I started by trying out some healthier alternatives and found that unsalted peanuts really helped a lot, both in meeting my protein goals for the day and in being pretty filling and having a nice crunchy texture that I like in my snacks. I understand the flavor is kind of bland for some folks but trying out dry roasted or honey roasted worked for me too. 

Once that was going well I kicked beer and soda, water, water, too. Swapped out the fast food with Subway (Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki FTW!) and did a lot more shopping for groceries at a farmer's market stand near my house,  but still doing plenty of Healthy Choice microwavable dinners for my half-hour lunch at work or for a meal after a workout. Switching to wheat bread and cutting any and all white sauces/dressings out of my diet have helped too, and the only kind of candy I eat now (after dropping my beloved Wild Berry Skittles) is salted nut rolls (which are just too delicious). I still don't schedule out my diet in really hardcore fashion, but more just snack on peanuts and eat only when my hunger warrants a meal (rather than gorge myself at every rumble of my stomach like I used to). I have noticed that my appetite has decreased pretty significantly from six months ago

Once I had the diet part down

Most of my stuff early on was running according to the schedule linked and bodyweight stuff, and bodyweight squats. I downloaded Fitocracy onto my iPhone (which is an AWESOME way to track your workouts, I think) and that's been a great source for workout ideas and for trying out new things. Once I felt that I had a decent grip on strength training, I picked up a pair of dumbbells with interchangeable weights for about $20 at Wal-Mart and have been working my way up to 15 lbs each. I'm expecting to do more stuff with equipment and heavier weights once I have access to my university's wellness center in the next few weeks.

I looked around and saw one guy who was very lean, and round bellies.

I'm a forty-four-year-old beginner. I decided I would lose weight first then start StrongLifts. I've been lifting about six weeks and I look in the mirror and at comparison photos but see no difference except the prior weight loss. I was getting discouraged--I know it's been only a month a half

Anyway

Any gains you make now to strength, or even the best in the gym, but you don't have to be. Even looking *somewhat* like Michelangelo's David will make you one of the best developed men most people will regularly meet.

Lose some weight, but in less than a year you can make a vast improvement.  Every time you add a few pounds or an extra rep or two you'll know you're better. When those extra pounds and reps start showing, everyone else will know you're better, too.

If you're getting discouraged like I was, and Steve Reeves and whoever are the exceptions. How many guys do you even meet in real life who have physiques like underwear models? But you can still be better than you are now and better than most and it doesn't take years or steroids or great genes, it just takes a little bit of regular effort, tracking your progress, and having a little bit of patience.

For the first year of lifting

I gotta say that the difference between doing alright and doing great is just seriously tracking what weights you are doing and following a good program.  I made the most results on a legs/push/pull split.  Learned everything I know about fitness from youtube

Yet...somewhere along the way he got strong. Mentally and physically. Somewhere along the way he lost the weight. Somewhere along the way he gained his confidence back. The discipline from the gym had no choice but to start leaking into other parts of his life. I hadn't seen him at the gym after I stopped picking him up because he started getting up earlier and going before work. I didn't see any of this.

On Friday

""Hey buddy.""

""Yoooooo! Where are you

""Nothing

""Did you go to the gym yet?"" he asked.

""Nah

To summarize its conclusions (from the abstract -- I did not examine its analysis or review): 

*  To maximize muscle hypertrophy

* Protein supplementation pre- and post- workout increase performance, hypertrophy and strength. 

* 3-4 grams of leucine during the post-workout meal promote maximum protein synthesis. Also

* In contrast

* A (weight-lifting) training protocol tailored for muscle hypertrophy and strength should be at least 10–12 weeks in length and involve three to five training sessions weekly

With my arbitrary IF routine I sort of [bulked/recomped/whatever'd (PIC)](http://i.imgur.com/0r8S6.jpg) until today. To be honest, I am truly ashamed to have a 300lb 1rm deep squat after so many days - it is my favourite exercise and should be bigger.)

My upper routine is lax - I just focus on form and repeat reps until the muscle is tired. This might be 160kg deadlifts, 95kg bench etc. I've had too much going on to obsess over lifts - I just make sure I work regularly. Obviously this has led to months of stalling of which I am 100% aware - I aim to remedy this when I settle in China and begin a real /r/fitness strength program, complete with squatsandoats. Greyskull perhaps, *though your advice would be greatly appreciated.*



&gt;Why Intermittent Fasting? My biggest[ vice is food](http://i.imgur.com/NNF6e.jpg) - I have these odd cravings to eat huge portions of awfully delicious junk food. I also hate breakfast and love Xtend BCAAs. IF harmonises nicely with these aspects.  It allows me to get down to a 6-pac in &lt; 30 days if required

Ladies (and sure gents)

**Edit:** Here's a similar pose as the before picture: http://i.imgur.com/IyDWu.jpg

And can you believe I've been working out for ~2 years _before_ that before shot?? Yes. My routine/diet sucked: 5days per week, legs, shoulders, arms (day filler). Doing 3 sets of 8-12 reps.

It wasn't until ~Oct. (I believe) I picked up on SS/SL and ran with SL5x5. I did SL5x5 up until 3 weeks ago when I switched to 5/3/1 + BW accessories due to stalling and change of goals. My maxes on SL5x5:

* Bench Press: 175x4
* Squat: 225x5 (then fall back to sub 220 for some reason)
* OHP: 105x3
* Row: 165x5
* Deadlift: 305x3

In between SL5x5 days (Tu/Th), I've started Crossfit on Sat. mornings.

Now, fats, and calories.

I was happy with my weight, I intentionally aimed for a slow gain. It's a (edit) self-created diet borrowing some ideas from LeanGains (1 meal, 10g bcaa).  My daily routine for weekdays:

* 7:30am: Shake - whole milk + whey, and AM multivitamin
* 9:30am: 4 eggs at work
* 12pm: gym (on and off pre- such as whiteflood and jack3d with 5g bcaa)
* 1:30pm: Post-workout shake - whole milk + weight gainer (currently [pro complex gainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/gainer.html))
* 3:30pm: A random snack high in protein
* 6pm: chicken/pork/steak/hamburger/etc with v8 as my veggie serving
* 8pm: Shake - whole milk + whey
* 10:30p: Shake - whole milk + casein and ZMA

Weekends, and not gorging. Now, I understand my diet may be a factor in my stalls -- I'm alright with that. I'm still tweaking, to this day, adding things here and there. Lean gains are what I'm after, even if it sacrifices strength.

Did the guy at the beginning of Oblivion whine about how he got to where he was?  No, and started walking towards the nearest mountain.  
  
DO NOT think of the mountain ahead of you.  Think of each day as a step.  One step at a time is all you have to do.  Promise that you will be a better person tomorrow, and that's it.  
  
Sometimes you will fail, and if you just finish most days at/under par, that bogey or two isn't going to kill your score.

Shut up, I'd be a 250 lbs. Jehovah's Witness living in a trailer park. But I'm not. You know why? Because I realized that being dirt poor sucks, being fat sucks, and being religious sucks. So I decided that when I grew up, I wasn't going to be those things. And I'm not.

If you are fat

It's not rocket science: humans weren't meant to eat ridiculous amounts of processed carbs. Humans weren't meant to sit around all day. Stop doing those things, and take it one day at a time. It's simple, really.

Eat less calories. Yes, even in tough and stressful circumstances, so you don't have an excuse.

Exercise. I don't care what you do. No fucking excuses. *""But I hurt my...""*--- shut up. Do something. Figure it out.

Either live your life as a victim

No more 'fat tolerance'. It's gone too far.

If you are fat and working on it, guess what - you are the 0.1%, but that still doesn't excuse you from doing your best.  If all the different mental medication you are on, and the lack of therapy that you need is also making you fat... I don't even know.  That's just sad.

EDIT: So originally I just intended this post as a bit of an introduction of sorts

Diet:I Stick strictly to the 5-6 evenly sized meals a day plan, grilled chicken, turkey, and fish, I mix in brown rice and beans too. I find that hot sauce is my best friend on this diet. I do drink a protein shake after workouts, I buy a different one every time usually, to get some verity.  So for example today I had blueberries and oatmeal for breakfast, grilled chicken, and celery for my 4th

For my workout routine I work my schedule for lifting like this; I do 1 muscle group a day focus, Wednesday legs, Thursday shoulders, Friday arms. I pick 6 or 7 exercises for each and change them out every 4 weeks or so. I start with 3 sets of 4 reps as much weight as I can, working for 5 then 6 reps all the way to 8 then add weight and repeat. I take 90 seconds break between sets, and go for a 2 second motion  count in each direction for most movements. 
For cardio, and do boxing or karate 3 days a week. Sundays I don't do anything,lifting or cardio, and every 5th week I usually lighten or almost completely eliminate my workout routine for a ""rest week"" 

A couple of you have mentioned that I'm over training? I don't know if I am, how would you recommend I modify my routine?

I've also been asked for a chest picture

A lot of questions about loose skin, I lost 50lbs in the first 3 months, it seamed like once it started, it wouldn't stop coming off. The skin is still Loose but it definitely is shrinking.

EDIT: I feel like I must say that, if these people want to play a sport or something, hell yeah I'm down, but if they want to sit and eat fattening food and watch movies, it turns me off from wanting to be around them, not saying that I wouldn't want to enjoy a movie night with my friends, but I'm going to work that junk food off, I feel like I'm trying to live through other people

CONCLUSION!: It seems that everyone on here bashing me for openly stating that I have a bias for overweight people who don't do anything about it, that they too, had feelings and thoughts similar to the ones I initially stated. So yes, in general, people who've made progress do feel a certain way about others who do not want to better themselves, though we need to get rid of those emotions/opinions/feelings, they are without question there.

* 5k Run Time: Around 25 minutes
* 10K Run Time: 58 minutes
* 16K Run Time: Finished Tough Mudder Scotland in 3.5 hours

Method:

Went mountain biking with colleagues and was disgusted by how unfit I'd become. Ten years of junk, but worked it in around training for the Tough Mudder in July. Lifted 3 days a week and ran 3 days a week. I built up the running by doing hill sprints on rest days from lifting, when I could do 3 sets of 5 sprints I tried running 2 miles, which went OK, and gradually built up my mileage from there. Then I started running up a local mountain called Bennachie on Friday nights, keeping up with the same colleagues who had beasted me so badly mountain biking only a few months earlier. For the last couple of months I've been doing my own workout plan, using the knowledge I've gained over the last year about how my body responds and fitness in general

Diet:

I don't do anything special

Conclusion:

Pretty mediocre physique change compared to some folks I've seen on here, I feel awesome and I've done really cool, fun things like the Tough Mudder and a Spartan race...I'm running up mountains for fun and lifting weights that would have broken me in two a year ago. The point is that my physical fitness and mental wellbeing are significantly improved and my horizons have expanded, my goal was never to become a fitness model.

My philosophy is as long as every week I'm a wee bit better in some aspect and able to do something I couldn't before then I'm doing it right.

In the next year I want to really get a grip on the diet side of things and work on my lift numbers

What most ""ringers"" (as they are colloquially known) do is travel from one ring to another by pulling with their arms, pull ups, leg raises, etc.

After 6 months of working out on the rings (about 2-3 times per week) I've noticed a drastic difference in the way I look and feel. **I don't lift any weights (besides my own body weight) or follow any strict diet**. The only other exercise I do is mild cycling to get around the city. 

I am very passionate about this now. It is my dream to see more of these rings built around the world so people of all ages can have fun and get in shape. For that reason I've set up a website with some more info and videos to help promote it. This might be a shameless plug but I am not making money from this. If I end up raising money in the future every dollar would go toward building more and teaching people how to use them.

Info and videos at: [TravelingRings.org](http://travelingrings.org)

* Use fat free cottage cheese. I know it sounds crazy but it really does taste fine and it's super healthy.
* Typical toppings that I use include chicken breast, ground turkey, and pineapple.

1367747948.0,1dq4wr,Best cardio workouts for fatloss,murbz,759,184,459,"Hi all

I'm a lurker

Currently I work out at the gym 3 times a week focusing on weight loss mainly with weights added. I split my weight groups but do 25minutes of crosstrainer cardio every time I go to the gym.

My gym is quite limited you could say, cross-trainers and pull-rowers. I cant really do exercise bikes or pull-rowers because I get this weird pinch just above my right knee and it prevents me from doing those exercises for more than 2-3 minutes.

I guess my question is; what are some effective cardio workouts I can do so I don't get bored with just crosstrainer?

Thanks for any suggestions.

1332608530.0,rbjt5,Ten things I've discovered in five years of self coaching. (very long),,754,182,139,"Five years ago I was 250 pounds and a flight of stairs was a serious obstacle. I made changes

1.	Don’t buy in. It’s hard to stay objective, they blame themselves. Then they give up all together. There is no one single thing that does it all and there is no one single perfect program. 

2.	Don’t do too many things at once. You’ve probably heard of at least one program that claims you can be bigger, last longer, out jump, out play, on and on, etc. etc. They never live up to it. Focus on what you need most. Are you in bad shape? Overweight? Concentrate on DIET, basic strength and endurance before you worry about developing the flactiod, wrapped in a navy seal

3.	Keep recovery in mind. Remember, too soon, too often. You will fail. Find a different program or different hobbies. You’re not Wolverine, you don’t recover faster than anyone else. Quit kidding yourself about this.

4.	Don’t worry about a bad workout. Don’t worry about a week of bad workouts. Don’t scrap a program that was working because of a week of bad workouts. Worry about a bad month. Change things up if you hit two bad months but evaluate why it failed first. There’s a possibility that one simple thing could have fixed everything. 

5.	KISS. Keep It Simple Stupid. This reflects some of rule 2, decline bench press, pec flies, skull crushers and tricep kickbacks in the same workout to build either size or strength. It’s actually detrimental to most people. If you can do 30 reps of that many upper body exercises then you didn’t use enough weight. You spent a lot of recovery capitol for little benefit. People do this all the time and get nowhere. Stop it.

6.	DDSS. Don’t Do Stupid Shit. This should be obvious

7.	Give up Elite and embrace not being so. Are you over 20? 25? 30? Yes? Are you competing on a world stage in the sport of your choice? No? Then I have some bad news for you. Sure, I’d be doing you no favors by telling you that if you did some program cooked up by an NFL Strength and Conditioning coach and closed your eyes and wished really hard and practiced every day that you could be the next Vince Papale. What you’ll probably end up is disillusioned and back on the couch with a six pack and Doritos. You’re not an elite athlete. Train like a beginner, then train like an intermediate athlete, then maybe train like an advanced one. But stop stealing programs from Olympic training camps. Once you do you’ll actually make some progress and have some real victories to celebrate and you might amaze yourself one day. Until you give up the fantasy of suddenly appearing on a world stage out of nowhere you’re doomed to repeat burn out after burn out. And for those rare exceptions that do make it, I would argue that on some level they understood and applied this.

8.	Often the best program, how well do you think you’ll do on the Adkin’s diet? Be honest about this. The momentum you lose from failing like this is awful. The same goes for programs, do you dislike running more than a mile? Why would you do Couch to 5K? Hate the big box gym scene? Why join one? This should be covered under Rule 6 but so many people waste time repeatedly setting themselves up for failure that it gets its own entry. If you quit doing it, it’ll never work. Find something you can do consistently.

9.	Read books on the subject. Actual books. E-books are okay, it might be a good program. This isn’t absolute but it can be a damn good guideline. There’s a lot of information on the internet, but not all of it is good. In fact, most of it is crap. Be wary.

10.	Don’t make your own program. This seems to contradict Rule 9, Pavel or Dan John. Decades of experience as both athlete and coach does. I cringe whenever I hear someone say something like “XXXX Program is good but for someone in my situation you need to change…” What situation? You can’t squat? Learn. Can’t do this or that? Can you learn to? Are you injured? No? Don’t jack with the program. You’re not qualified to. It’s not necessary either. The only people who need a custom program are people dealing with a long term debilitating injury, like a missing limb. Everything else can be taught, learned or fixed so you can do the program as written. It may take years and doctors, but it can happen. And you should make it happen. Those names and the programs associated with them are popular for a reason. Results.

Remember, but it is still stress on your body. In fact, what you call ""getting fitter"" is basically your body saying ""Aw poop, I gotta divert  some resources to deal with this shit that keeps happening to me."". That's why consistency is so important. If you only perform significantly stressful exercise once a month, the stress on your body is going to be too small to see significant gains any time soon. That's also why you have to keep increasing the weights, otherwise once your body gets used to the weights, it's just gonna chill.

You have to give your body the resources to deal with the stress though. Otherwise, it'll just not do that much to adjust to the stress. Food is the more obvious resource, but sleep is just as important. Check this [infographic](http://i.imgur.com/K8qsn.jpg). In particular, I'd like you to look at the average sleep of those famous athletes.

* [My Transformation Thesis](http://foodisforfuel.com/2012/01/my-transformation-thesis/)


Someone on a forum asked me if there was going to be a time when I would start to worry about gaining weight for an entire month. He wasn't trying to be rude but rather just asking a legitimate question. I thought for a moment and began to reply. An hour later

In the Hitch Hiker's guide when supercomputer ""Deep Thought"" is asked to solve the Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, it takes the computer 7 1/2 million years to come up with the answer, which is 42. I feel like if you paid for that service, you should get your money back. The same problem exists whenever I think about writing about my solution for obesity. The answer is, ""Stop being obese.""

I realized today that I'll never be able to write a book about this because I can tell you how to transform yourself into the person you want to be in under 15 pages. I might be able to do it under 10.

I'm eating healthy food, and taking thyroid medication now. I'm also taking thermogenic compounds like caffeine, green tea extract, and on my second month of a three month Phentermine cycle. I'm now working every day for 9+ hours a day and moving around way more often than I did while I steadily losing weight and sitting on my ass reading forums. I'm working out regularly and doing CrossFit, which leaves me drained like nothing else I've ever done before.

I'm gaining weight. I'm even happy with that weight gain.

The guy on the forum made me think. Why am I not worried that much about gaining weight? The past 2 years of my life have been about losing weight. [My blog](http://www.foodisforfuel.com) was born because I got good at losing weight. Lots of people on the Internet know of the name ""Vainglory"" now because I lost all of that weight. So

So I'm gaining weight. I'm not that worried about it. The normal response for most people would be to decrease their caloric intake because they'd panic. My natural -- thoroughly indoctrinated -- inclination is to do that as well

Throughout the past 2 years

I got rid of knee pain, joint pain, mental pain, and went from a cynical and overtly defensive waste of oxygen to existing in a kind of extended state of nirvana.  I felt warmth and at peace with myself, like how you'd feel when you solve a puzzle you've been staring at for 28 years. It's not the weight loss that gave me that but through gaining confidence and control over my situation.  Like how Goose would have felt if he had pulled he and Maverick out of the flat spin instead of ejecting himself into a solid plate of fiberglass like a junebug into the windshield of a soccer mom's minivan on a dusty back road.

* [Round Peg in a Square Hole](http://www.foodisforfuel.com/pics/fitnessindustry.gif)

That's the diet and fitness industry and what's inherently wrong with it. You are a number and not a person with natural human weaknesses. Each person who goes on the Biggest Loser is subjected to a battery of mental and physical tests to make sure they won't snap and stomp around the studio on a murderous rampage. They've got a team of lawyers whose sole purpose is to figure out how they can imply that you should try crazy things to lose weight like their contestants at home by yourself

Profit is about is reaching the largest base of consumers with the most generalized approach; fishing with a net versus fishing with a spear. The number on the scale is something that everyone can relate to and access easily to diagnose their worth. So the entire diet and fitness industry has become about embracing that number and placing it on a pedestal. The problem is that yes, condition everyone else to do the same. Somewhere along the line the popular approach to weight loss became ""diet and exercise"". Before that, ""diet"" was the popular word for ""starve"".

So now the accepted method for becoming a better person is lots and lots of cardio and starving yourself. Anthing -- literally anything -- to make that number drop. It's your score in the game of life.

* [Redditor montereyo's 6 month progression.](http://i.imgur.com/1HgnU.jpg)

This girl is from Reddit post I saw about a month ago and weighs exactly the same in both panes. 137 pounds. I'd get into the misconception about girls and weightlifting but I'm going on another tangent right now and I'm still trying to stay under 10 pages.

The number on the scale means absolutely nothing. It's the variables that matter. If I weigh 300 pounds but I move around like I weigh 200, but we tend to focus on three of them that we have the most control over and they happen to also be the three that matter the most when we're discussing body composition and appearance. Lean muscle mass, fat mass, and body water.

You can manipulate the values of those variables through nutrition alone.

* **Lean Muscle Mass** = Protein
* **Body Fat Mass** = Sugar
* **Body Water** = Hydration + Lean Muscle Mass + Sugar

* **Body Composition** = Protein + Hydration - Sugar

The number on a normal scale will give you everything, the more water you'll be storing, especially if you take creatine like I do. So even if you're cutting fat, you'll still end up weighing more if you gain muscle. That overall number should drop over a period of months, not weeks.

If you're trying to lose weight in general while also trying to improve your body composition

* [The Statue of David](http://i.imgur.com/ULNrT.jpg)

Use your mind to wrap a silk sheet taut around Mr. David's midsection there and then shine a light from just above him. It will look amazing because his definition will translate through the sheet because there's nothing between the stone and the sheet. The stone will create peaks and crevices in the sheet that catch light like the sun setting over a valley rather than the boring scene you'd see if you imagined a flat desert. Or if you prefer a less poetic explanation: it's the reason body builders cover themselves in brown goo before going on stage. They want their definition to absorb as much light as possible to create contrasting shadows.

Now, and the stone is muscle. The problem is that between the skin and muscle is a layer of fat that will obfuscate the peaks and crevices that the muscle's definition should be providing. I.E., sun setting over a flat desert. The skin is still taut but in order to lay against the defined muscle and create the necessary textures, it must first go through a layer of fatty insulation.

Body fat -- the only thing in the way of your ""toned"" look -- can be attacked through nutrition alone. The goal is to increase your basal metabolic rate, low dietary fat, and low carbohydrate diet will ensure that you're burning body fat while building or retaining lean muscle mass. Resistance training will result in more lean muscle mass and higher bone density, which will increase your basal metabolic rate and overall weight, as well as improve your health. Increasing your heart rate for an extended period of time will also increase your basal metabolic rate.

If your body doesn't get enough fuel (calories) to convert to energy, your body will begin to catabolize (burn) your lean muscle mass for its energy. That's why a lot of marathon runners you'll see look both decrepit and chubby somehow and why people who try to improve their appearance by eating at a caloric deficit and then go and spend an hour or more on an elliptical 7 days a week will look exactly the same or worse 3 months in to their campaign. Cardio is for endurance, not appearance. 

Now that I've added CrossFit and metabolic conditioning to my plan

So, or this month, or this 3 months, is irrelevant. Science is my homeboy now. I also have access to body composition analysis data from a Tanita scale each week that reaffirms my beliefs, which makes it fairly easy to remain pious.

So no. No

The secret to transforming myself from a 538 pound man into a 273 man was to treat myself like two different people. One is so far in the past that it's already like he only ever existed in photographs. The other has a firm grasp on his life and isn't letting go for anything. I tended my wounds and took detours around my weaknesses until I felt strong enough to attack them.

Now I'm stalking my way through those weaknesses like a lion through high grass with my head up and my eyes tracking with the movement of the life that I want; each and every fear casually rolling off of my shoulders only to be left behind

Hey, so I guess it's about time to contribute something. I hope this post can inspire other women to lift heavy and be strong, and to ignore myths that lifting weights will make you masculine. I am proof that this is not true! And I hope this reaches those of you with health issues that feel like sometimes it will just never happen, because I have news for you- it will if you work for it.

My whole life, but this couldn't counter some of the unhealthy choices I made as a kid. I was sexually abused at a very young age, which threw me into a spiraling depression throughout my childhood, and subsequently, I started to eat compulsively as a way to comfort myself. My parents would try to encourage me to be more active, but I was a bit of a couch potato. I was bullied a lot in school because of my size, and that contributed to all of my problems even more. I remember getting a physical in 5th grade and crying hysterically because at the age of eleven I already weighed 139 pounds. But I didn't do much to change.

Fast forward to high school, and I had to get put on prednisone a few times and paid a visit to the E.R. The doctors couldn't figure out what was causing my asthma to flair up, so they prescribed me Advair 250/500, which got rid of my asthma symptoms, but wreaked total chaos on my entire body. I gained 20 pounds in a matter of a few months, my depression got even worse, and my appetite went crazy. I started to become photosensitive and broke out in painful hives if I stayed in the sun. On top of that, it seemed to be for nothing

My lung doctor told me all my asthma problems could be potentially eliminated if I lost 20 pounds. As well, which only gets activated in your airways. He referred me to a naturopath who got me taking numerous supplements such as fish oil, a B complex, a mineral compound called AOR Bone Basics, zinc citrate, magnesium, and CLA, but over time I modified it to my own liking/purposes. 

Essentially, except for sparingly using local raw honey or maple syrup. 


I ended up losing 25 more pounds than was suggested. I started working out in January 2012, and then during the summer, I didn't have time to get to my gym, so I did bodyweight routines and HIIT workouts at home before going to work at a commercial photography studio and doing manual labor.

I started lifting in September 2012. So far, as well as her LiveFit Trainer. Ultimately, I lift 6 days a week and usually 4 or 5 days of cardio for 45 minutes, doing intervals. Right now I'm transitioning between workout plans, but am about to start Pauline Nordin's full body Badass Workouts and her Fighter Diet plan, and am super excited about it!

Now, like hip bones and shoulder blades and collar bones and my jawline and it feels AWESOME! I'm not done yet though. I want to gain more definition all over and drop my body fat percentage a bit more. 

Thanks for reading this super long post!

Today's a pretty special day for [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com) - we started working on it 2 years ago! r/fitness was the very first place we ever sent Fitocracy's invite-only beta out into the wild and you guys have been amazingly important to us ever since. Your feedback during our first year had an enormous impact on how the product evolved. This was our very first post about it

I'm happy to say that two years in, has grown leaps and bounds. People tell us every day how Fitocracy has changed their lives. As a team, we understand that the community we've created is the #1 reason people on Fitocracy have been able to take their health and fitness far beyond what they could've imagined. And in many many ways, the early seeds of the Fitocracy community came from r/fitness itself.

I wrote a blog post reflecting on the past two years. If you're interested in learning a little more about the journey so far

* 435 / 197.5 kg - 3 whites
* 457 / 207.5 kg - 3 whites [all-time PR]

9/9, lowest I’ve weighed for the 132s, all-time meet PR regardless of weight, Wilks PR, coached a good friend’s first PL meet (she hit around a 340 Wilks like a boss).  Before going into the details, this was pretty much the best meet I could have ever asked for and then some.

##Thanks##

I would like to thank two people in particular

* gzcl - for always being there to discuss training, and always keeping it real.  We give each other shit all the time, but it's always in good fun to push each other to be better than the day before.  Total bromance goin on.
* smoftie - for doing your first meet like a boss, and being an awesome person, even if you do go full-tard too often.

##Pre-Meet##

Between the San Jose Open I did back in October and this meet, I really didn’t have a program, but it wasn’t fucking around either – just listening to my body and attempting to make smart work-set selections each week.  **That's right, I did my own thing and didn't follow a program, gasp**.  For bench, that meant hitting a 5 lb single rep heavier than the week before, doing a couple sets of 8-10 reps at around 135, **I trained sumo and then pulled a conventional PR in competition**, but when I started to have my eye on it

##Dat Der Meet##

This was a pretty large meet, which was absolutely perfect.  This allowed me to focus on her during her flight and her warm-ups (while flight D went) and then switch to my warm-ups and my lifts during the other flights, so I couldn’t have asked for better scheduling in that regard.

###Squats###

My squat warm-ups were pretty standard, so I felt like that might have been the cause.  I decided to basically say fuck it and keep my thumb over the bar and deal with any elbow pain a bit later.

Squat opener at 165 kg / 363 lbs flew up pretty fast and felt good, but the rep itself was still pretty fluid and way faster than I was expecting so with that in mind, I said fuck it all, we’re going to PR territory and put down 185 kg / 407.9 lbs as my third attempt.  I visualized the lift several times before doing it, tried to treat it just like any other lift, and then crushed that shit.  All-time PR in the books and 3.2xBW squat given 3 white lights by USAPL judges … so far so good.

###Bench###

Bench was tricky beast, but after a ridiculously easy 198, I put down 97.5 kg / 214 lbs as my second attempt, so that I could either make a small nudge to 220 or a bit higher if it felt good.  After the second attempt (another set of 3 white lights), I realized 220 was going to happen without a problem, so I decided 226 would be better (231 probably wasn’t going to go, plus that would be 16 lbs heavier than anything I’ve done since the injury).  226 was slow, just had to be patient with it.

###Deadlifts###

Deadlift warm-ups initially felt a little heavy, I changed up my form a bit to have the bar an inch further in front of me than normal, allowing me to get an extremely small roll with the bar to engage my lats and load the hamstrings.  I don’t know if that’s really helped, but it feels nice and prevents me from taking forever to just pull the bar.  187.5 kg / 413 lbs stupidly easy, like all my deadlift openers have been.  I went to 197.5kg / 435 lbs because that would put me in a good spot to go either 205 or 207.5 kg.  My second deadlift felt heavy, but I watched it on video before putting in my third attempt.  When I saw how well it went up, 207.5 kg was immediately put on my attempt card.

At this point, hit an all-time squat PR, was on track with all my goals (actually, ahead on squat and bench), the good friend I was coaching went 8/9 and hit a 340ish Wilks in her first meet, my old college coach was lifting in the next flight doing pretty well, and I had lifted at this meet 3 years ago as my first full meet.  Since that meet three years ago, got a nice job doing software engineering, and so on.  To sum up the next several minutes, etc.  I gave a good first pump on seeing 3 white lights and walked back to my chair to grab my stuff

##Post-Meet##

My next meet will be USAPL Raw Nationals in July so long as I’m not injured, or 2014 Arnolds, I don’t know.  I have a good idea of what I would like to do for my next training cycle and how it will be structured.  I won’t really go into detail here (though I have mentioned it to I think two or three people in total) because I find I do better if I use a, “do first, talk later” approach and I want to make sure that I bring my A-game at Raw Nationals, this was just a dress rehearsal.  I will say that I will be incorporating direct hypertrophy training and actual conditioning and mobility specific days.

Weight: 190

Age: 24
****

Quick Backstory:

I've lifted off an on (mostly off) throughout college (2007 - 2011) with okay results, which is where the cut begins. Unfortunately I don't think I have any pictures of the pre-bulk, but I guess I would say I was ""skinny fat"".

****
Workout:

I followed the LeanGains workout plan for the most part. I lifted 3x / week with the following split:

Workout A: Deadlift 2x5 ; OHP 3x5 ; Pull-ups 2x8-10 (Failure)

Workout B: Bench Press 3x5 : Chin-ups 3x8-10 (failure) ; Dips 2x10-15(failure)

Workout C: Squat 3x5 ; Various leg accessory exercises (changes


Note: For part of the cut I did 3x5 


Current Lift #'s:

Squat: 290 (3x5)  

Deadlift: 345 (1x5)

Bench: 195 (3x5) 

Overhead Press: 135 (3x5)

All of these lifts have dropped 10-20 lbs (except for DL which has gone up 20 lbs somehow)

****
Diet:
I tried to follow the LeanGains ""diet plan"" of eating with a 16/8 window (only eating within an 8 hour window. Usually 2PM-10PM). I also tried to follow the principle of LeanGains where you would eat a higher amount of carbs on your workout days and higher amounts of fats on your off days. I say tried because I was not very meticulous with the calories/macros - but it did effect my food choices to some degree. I think that in fitness the 80/20 rule is good for me, rough calorie tracking) but not to obsess over it. This has been key in helping me not burn out so far.

Here is an example of my typical workout day / off day:

(note: I eat take out basically every day

Workout Day: 1x Footlong Chicken Breast Subway sub (w/ bag of chips); 2x Protein Shakes (2 scoops each = 4 scoops a day); 1x Chipotle Burrito

Off Day: 1x Baconator (Wendy's) ; 2x Protein Shakes (2 scoops each = 4 scoops a day)


The goal is about 3.3k cals on bulk days and 2.3k on off days. I also have not changed this value at all since starting the cut
*****
I took the Progress pictures on the 1st and 15th of every month (coinciding with my paychecks). For some of the pictures I took it the morning after a workout day(""bulk day"") and then the next in the series is the next day, no flex and no pump with the same lighting(hard to do even in the same conditions apparently). 

Its also the same pair of pants in the 1st/last pic

During this time I ate fairly clean, or take advantage of the workout “window”.

At the time I believed there was a protein powder conspiracy and thought it wasn't as necessary as supplement companies want us to believe. Unfortunately

After my transformation I promptly landed a gorgeous girlfriend after a lifetime of singleness. Furthermore, and starting my own business, but now I'm getting back at it and am getting close to my goal of 175.

**Posture fixes - how to fix the upper body hunchback**

So, please do. This post shall be about the upper body dysfunction that normally accompanies the lower body issues.  But let’s get one thing straight – you can fix the upper body as much as you want, but unless the lower body is optimally aligned, the upper body will not be. The upper body is a slave to the lower body. Fix the lower body and the upper body gets a lot better. Fix the upper body and the lower body will not necessarily follow. I hope you understand this.

Most people in today’s society have the “Quasimodo” look, and in some cases, can lead to migraines.  The tight muscles in this scenario are usually the pec minor, the lats and sometimes, the upper abs. The stretched out muscles are the rhomboids, the mid and lower traps, and the thoracic extensors. Remember the hamstrings from yesterday’s article? The levators and traps are the equivalent of the hamstrings, they are in a stretched position. Look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/cTu1U.gif) picture of the head jutting forward. The levators have to always be active

So let’s get down to fixing this:

1)	Thoracic mobility. The spine consists of 3 areas – lumbar, the thoracic spine gets “locked” and immobile, and to make u for that, the lumbar spine has to move. This leads to a lot of low back pain and neck pain. So let’s make the thoracic spine mobile.  I have found that [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyhgIJq9gjw) or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1MCjihXq0&amp;feature=related) is the best exercise for thoracic spine extension mobility. Stay away from the lumbar and cervical region. Start from just below the shoulder blades and work your way up to the top of the shoulder blades. I have found that the best exercise for thoracic rotation mobility is [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo8rPut0GXI&amp;feature=fvsr). Make sure that the legs do not move and stay at a 90 degree angle. Only move from the upper back.

2)	[Stretching out the anterior torso and the lats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxr6xAB5ZM). If you have a history of throwing

3)	Work on scapular depression and retraction. The best bet for both would be [wall slides](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k2kqyzz3Ug) – they also open up the anterior shoulder. Don’t worry about keeping your wrist flat to the wall

4)	Work on your deep neck flexors. The best exercise is the [chin tuck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUkocZqnoFU). Imagine making a double chin.

5)	In my lower body post, and we don’t need more exercises to put them in that position. If you have to crunch, [reverse crunch](http://stronglifts.com/the-reverse-crunch-get-your-six-pack-abs/) – they don’t compress the rib cage. I would rather you not crunch at all.


So a good warmup for correcting upper body dysfunction would include:

1)	3-5 minutes of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46lGxDD4N9g). It's not necessary to move around like in the video

2)	Foam rolling of the pecs

3)	[Thoracic mobility](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-improve-your-thoracic-mobility/) coupled with scapular stability exercises – pick 2-3 from the thoracic mobility list and either do a set of wall slides or [rock

4)	[Shoulder flexion + hip extension pattern](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36NirsVrPok&amp;feature=player_embedded)

5)	[T-roll push-ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gatFVitWEIo&amp;feature=player_embedded) to teach the body how to use the enhanced thoracic mobility and scapular stability effectively.

There is a lot of info I left out on purpose; a lot of people nowadays have too much information to deal with and it leads to analysis paralysis. For a general workout program, it works the upper back and will get your shoulders in alignment very fast. One good low level exercise is the [Waterbury crucifix](http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/249crucifix2.jpg). Hold it for 2 minutes and keep the back straight.

One thing that I feel I will get a lot of questions on is the [YTWL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xck3d8LidME) exercise. While I do like the W and the L part, great go with it. But if you’re not familiar with them, the exercises I’ve outlined above will work fine. Another exercise that I’m iffy about is the [prone cobra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdWi2eCkvHY). It’s very easy to get extension at the lumbar spine instead of thoracic, and I think front squats are way better because they force you to extend the thoracic spine. Nick Tumminello does have a work-around for this [here](http://nicktumminello.com/2009/07/a-new-and-improved-ytwl/).

And there you have it. A pretty comprehensive program to reduce the curved upper back. Again, this isn't gonna help much. Be aware of posture and change your position every 20 minutes or so.

**Equipment**

- Quality/maintenance

Fortunately good quality stuff. Unfortunately maintenance is crap. Not uncommon to find one dumbbell missing from a pair. Dumbbells are treated as magical beings that somehow will return to their proper place when you look away. 

- Usage

Even though PTs are in abundance there are plenty of people misusing equipment. The squat rack is for anything but squats. In total I've seen less than ten people doing squats here. 
The no-weight-pull-and-slam with machines is norm. 

**People**

- PTs

Annoying sales men with little training. They get commission on the people they manage to bring into the gym. They sell classes

- Members

High and low. Some are extremely professional with their workouts

**Outifts**

- Women

Pants pulled a little bit too high is the norm. I've laughed at women in heels working the step machine. Looks before functionality is the mantra. 

- Men

Jeans with mobile phone clips are frequently seen. Dudes with underwear doubling as ""shorts"" are common. 

**Changing rooms**

- Facilities

I've been going to six different gyms and not a single one has had a shower area that doesn't turn into a steam sauna. For some reason ventilation is not prioritized. 

- Freebies

Hair dryers are provided

[Also from my first ever 5k run (Color me Rad was pretty rad)](http://imgur.com/2y2lvCy)

So 6 months ago

My big three lifts;

Bench: ~225 to 325 to 295 (I know, but I've never hit that 325 1RM since December. I went down to 305, but I know I'd get called out again without video proof, and the only proof I have is a [piss poor 295](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ9f3W1OLJA&amp;feature=youtu.be))

Deadlifts: ~135 to 365 to 385

Squats:~95 to 275 to 320

That also adds up to 1K, I would not be able to hit the 1K club. 

Also

Monday: Shoulders - Standing OHP, Clean + Jerk (light weights), and a bunch of light shoulder strengthening exercises

Tuesday: Back + Biceps - Deadlifts, Dumb bell rows, Hammer Curls, Preacher Curls

Wednesday: 5K run

Thursday: Chest + Triceps: Flat barbell, weighted dips, cable crosses

Friday: Same as Wednesday

Saturday: 5K Run

Sunday: Legs - Back Squats, Hip Adductors, Hamstring Curls, Standing Calf raises, sitting calf raises.

My goals back in December was to cut down to 10% BF @ 170, so I've achieved those. Right now, I'm trying to do some cool bodyweight exercises. And [have failed on many of them.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vS-nQmg7as&amp;feature=youtu.be). Still haven't tried dunking a ball yet, but one step at a time!

Also, where I feel at zen with my body and my goals. It's weird, but even 6 months ago, I would be really insecure with my body, keep thinking my body isn't good enough, need to be the strongest in the gym, etc. But now, but I'm not even concerned with hitting 10%; I'm happy with 11% and have maintained this weight and bf% for about 5 months. I'm okay with not being the strongest in the gym, the complete exhaustion

Quick word about my diet; I'm still counting my calories using MFP (it's seriously habit now) and am eating at 2000 calories for maintenance. I KNOW it sounds ridiculously low, and that's about it. I eat anything and everything now, as long as I don't go over 2000 calories and have at least 100 grams of protein at the end of the day. 

BUT

This is what I usually eat at lunch 2-3 times a week;

10 ozs boneless skinless chicken thigh (cut into chunks, light soy sauce, oyster sauce

1 cup of brown rice

1 cup of steamed vegetables

660 Calories: 17 grams of Fat

Also, drink a lot of water or diet pop and top it off with another bite of the caloric dense food. Seriously guys, try it. It works.

Holy shit this was a really long post.

TL;DR Be one with your body!

EDIT: One more thing. I really didn't mean for this update to be so philosophical but I think one of the reasons why I'm so at peace with my body now is that I'm finding a balance in my life. During the first 6 months, didn't go to bars, didn't even touch alcohol (I could count on one hand the number of times I drank). As a result, I got even more obsessed with fitness because it was the only thing I had. In the past 6 months however, I've really strived to find a balance in my life; I make it a goal to go out and see my friends, meet new people, try new things and better myself in ways other than just fitness. And I feel a lot better about everything. ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1i4xix/who_says_asians_are_tiny_pt2_1_year_cut_update/

---

**Prologue:**  
I remember years ago when I first started working out and posting here I went out and put together a program all on my own. I thought it through very thoroughly and was very proud of myself when I'd finished. I made a new thread about it and asked for people to critique it in the title. I expected for the most part people would approve of it and might offer tiny suggestions to improve on it. 

What I got was people telling me it was awful and I needed to scrap it completely and pick up a pre-made program which was created by someone who was an expert in the weightlifting/strength training or bodybuilding field. 

I was upset and annoyed at the time

Ask yourself this: Do you know more than Mark Rippetoe, ""no"").

Then why would you use some program you've made over one of theirs?

**Why your program is terrible:**  
1) *You've probably designed your program with way too many exercises and way too much volume for a beginner.*  

- Your program should consist primarily of the following exercises: the squat, heavy rows and plenty of core work.
- You do not need endless sets of isolation work right now. You need to focus on compound movements and work on getting a solid base/frame. 
- Right now you need to focus on correct form. Master squatting, and have them coach you on these essential lifts. 

2) *You've probably designed your program with way too much emphasis on mirror muscles and not enough on others.* 
 
- A good program will have at least as much focus, decline, dumbells, etc), dumbell flies, cable crosses, etc... and then when it's time for back day they do some lat pulldowns and maybe some other fairly useless exercise. This can lead to muscle imbalances which later down the road will mess you and your rotator cuff up. You don't want that. Back in the day when lifters spend tons of time on their back doing rows, face pulls
- You're probably neglecting your legs

3) *You've probably designed your program and left out tons of crucial information.*

- What are your goals? Strength? Hypertrophy? General fitness? What is your program supposed to do?
- What is your level of fitness? While it's usually ""beginner"", don't need nearly as much stimulation to shock them into growth. If you overdo it, you'll just burn yourself out and get nowhere.
- Sometimes you see truly awful programs which just toss out a number of exercises and don't bother to elaborate and then they expect someone to critique it. Other times you get a little more. I've yet to see someone incorporate rest times or tempo into their home-made programs

4) *Lastly

Often multiple times.   
Frankly
Please

There is a saying that ""Anything will work... for about 6 weeks"", progress. Think long-term, drop your ego and realize there are people out there who dedicate their lives to this and they know more than you. Find a program which suits your level of fitness and your goals. Use it.

5) *Here are some excellent programs which I hope you consider looking into:*

- [Rippetoes aka Starting Strength: I can personally attest to this program being superb. It's designed for any novice or beginner lifter but also for more experienced lifters who might not be used to a program consisting of heavy

- [Bill Starr 5x5 aka Madcow 5x5: I love this one. It's for an intermediate lifter and the focus of this program is to get you strong as quickly as possible. And it works.](http://muscleandbrawn.com/madcow-intermediate-5x5-workout/)

- [HST (Hypertrophy/Strength Training): I haven't personally lifted in this style but plenty of people swear by it. This should work well for someone looking for gains in both strength and hypertrophy (ie. getting both strong and bigger muscles).](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=280813)

- [German Volume Training: I've ran this and even having lifted for years before I ran it I was sore as a dog after pretty much every workout. DOMS doesn't necessarily mean it's working

- [There are PLENTY of other programs. Here is a guide here

- You should also venture out into the other sections

Weight: 193lb to 166lb

Body Fat: approx 22% to ~9/10% (estimates from Body Fat Friday)

**Story / Motivation**

Split from girlfriend of 4 years, read the FAQ and got started. 

The first few weeks were really grueling and I had to really nag at myself to go to the gym or control my diet, capable, healthy and active. 

I am so grateful for /r/fitness

I've just turned 21

**Diet**

First 3 months was around 2100 calories per day which got me down to 173lb

Never paid too much attention to getting exact macronutrients other than protein

Trying to maximise protein and minimise carbs is always what has worked best for me when cutting weight. In the period that I was eating ~2800 calories


**Exercise**

First 3 months

Next 3 months, shoulders, legs. Made sure to keep all the major compound exercises (dead, squat, bench, OHP, pull ups

I did HIIT on 2 off days a week for the very first month and felt it helped boost the fat loss

Since the touch season ended about 2 months ago

**Lifts**

Starting 5RM: Deadlift 110

Current 10RM: Deadlift 240


**Supplements**

Used whey protein from the beginning

I thought I would post this for anyone that just wants to learn more, or be better informed, or even just understand why.",RoidSerene,860,459, please send me a PM.  I am totally cool with chatting and sharing any and all info that I have with anyone that is interested.**

It’s also ok if you want to rage/hate/down vote – I brought my flame shield and this is a throwaway.  Please grab your soap box and rain brimstone if it will make you feel better.  I don’t mind.

I spent quite a long time doing the research, or any competition.  Some individuals, even after hearing that, still feel inclined to accuse me of cheating.

It’s ok if they feel that way.  We each choose our own road.  Even if we both work as hard during any given workout, and more dedication to get to the same place as me.  They deserve to feel proud of that.  I am cool with that.

I’m not in competition with anyone.  I do this because it makes me feel good.  I think steroids are about efficiency, than anyone else.  I work out at home, alone, just because I like the way it makes me feel.

I know about the side effects.  I know about the risks and the dangers.  So far I haven’t experienced any problems.  Maybe I am lucky.  Maybe I am tempting fate.

But

I’m happy to talk about it.  I’m cool with the lecture, is always valuable.

**EDIT**:  A lot of people are asking for pics

First do a goggle search for TRT clinic (it doesn't matter where they are located).  Fill out the contact form on all of them.  Wait for the phone calls to start rolling in.

Next take your pick of who to proceed with.  I was timid at first

These clinics focus on sales volume for their pharmaceuticals.  You will only ever talk to a sales rep.  They will try to upsell you.  Counter with a request for a price list.  If they refuse at least ask for prices for medication you are specifically interested in.

Make your decision based on a given clinic's prices as well as their willingness to meet your treatment demands.  You have a lot of options to choose from

After that you will need blood work.  They will coordinate an appointment with a local place.  You will probably pay

Next is a physician's exam.  The clinic will probably send you a form.  Just schedule an appointment and ask your doc to give you a physical and fill out the form.  If you are worried about what your doctor thinks of you then tell him/her it is for work

The final step is a medical background form.  If you have ever been to the doc you have seen one.  They are usually online.  There is a chance a rep might call you to ""coach"" you through filling it out...

Afterwards they will call you within a couple days.  The doctor will have looked it over, and background, give you a prescription (all of this relayed through a ""patient coordinator"").  They will try to upsell you some injectable vitamins, and who knows what all else.  Be smart, stick to your guns, only buy what you want.

Costs can range from $400 for a low 200mg/week test dosage all the way up to $1200 for a heavy oxandrolone script (and all necessary pins, sharps container, etc).  You will pay over the phone.  Medication will be mailed to your house within a couple days.

You will get a call with info on how to do the injections.  They suck.  The first time you stick a 1.5"" needle into your ass is the worst.  But it offers about as much resistance as sticking a needle into a warm stick of butter.  There is almost zero pain.  Your ass WILL be sore the next day

Test-c and other steroids like Nadrolone have long half lives.  They can take up to 3 or 4 weeks to build up to mostly maximum quantities in your blood.  Be patient.  When you start waking up with a daily erection you can assume it is starting to kick in.

Most clinics, recurring cycle (no down time, no PCT).  You can fight this.  Be smart and get what you want.

After that?  Chow the fuck down and work hard.  Enjoy the surprising progress.  Enjoy the weight loss.

Make sure to constantly evaluate the benefit to cost/risk.  Establish goals and ask yourself if you are getting closer to them.  Make sure you are getting what you want.  Have your doc check your cholesterol

**EDIT 2**

A recurring theme for a counter argument is ""you haven't reached X point

I counter that we are all interested in pushing efficiency.  We voice it with our use of supplements, or creatine intake.  We voice it in our quest to find the ideal number of reps and sets.  I simply push efficiency further than some.

**FINAL EDIT**

The reaction to a post about such a taboo subject has been a revelation.  Despite my fears that I would face significant criticism, I have instead found myself confronted with a great deal of honest curiosity, acceptance, and even support.

I have always found it really hard to put on weight, train and rest all over again. Everyone in my family just figured its another fad but here is the proof that education is all you need to really get the ball rolling.

This is a photo of me 18 months ago compared with a photo of me tonight. (Granted the posing is pretty bad but hey

http://i.imgur.com/pBpR6.jpg

So anyway i just wanted to share some of my progress with you guys as its nice to get a little recognition from people who know their stuff. Plus im too shy to post anything like this on fb cause I don't want everything thinking I'm one of those guys that likes to show off his muscles as I'm generally in hoodie's and well covered up.. 

If i can do this

**EDIT** front pic. keep in mind that this is with a crappy camera

Edit: it's getting late 3.04am and I need some beauty sleep

EDIT 2 : **Here comes the diet you have all been waiting for**. *I might post more pics later on but i have to study for an exam too so this is all i can do right now*

Before i begin

8am -- mass gainer shake (nutribolics mass fusion) with a banana plus my multivitamin. 

10.30 -- 6 egg whites with 2 yolks and a pro-biotic yoghurt

1pm -- 250g of sliced turkey on wholemeal wrap and an apple/sometimes same as 6.00 meal just prepacked)

3.30pm -- protein bar (im generally sitting at a desk and cant get any proper food at this time)

6.00pm -- (pre workout meal) 150g of basmati rice with 8oz of chicken breast/steak/turkey. Green 
beans/broccoli/mixed veg

7.00pm -- workout (take bcaa's on way to the gym)

8.20pm -- (Post workout shake) myofusion/dymatize or any whey isolate blend. Creatine mono 5-8g's

11pm -- 150g wholegrain rice or pasta with 8oz of chicken breast/steak/turkey Green beans/broccoli/mixed veg

12.30-1.00am -- between 8-10 egg whites (slow release protein throughout the night) 

Take in as much water as you can throughout the day especially if you are taking creatine with your supps. i generally take in between 5-7 litres a day

Like i said guys this is just a rough template that enables me to hit my daily macros. I often have to mix meals up or change things a little bit. We are all different so find out what works best for you.

I didn't see you again until a week later when you were with the trainer again so I assumed you were going to the gym when I wasn't.

Fast forward to yesterday. I hadn't seen you in a few months (I was on vacation for 4 weeks and hadn't been at the gym for awhile) and was shocked at your change. You were doing a walk around the gym while carrying about 50 pounds in weights. Your back was straight. Your face was NOT red but instead had a look of confidence! And you had definitely lost weight! I'd say close to 20lbs.

You were in the zone so I didn't feel like saying this to you personally. So on Reddit I say to you ""Fuck yeah dude! You're doing it!"".

- I go the gym about 5-6 times a week, Weds-shoulders, Thurs-tris, Fri-legs, Sat-back). I do abs about every other day.

- Diet is pretty lax. I feel like fat loss is so exaggerated and people just want to find something easy to do. 3500cals is a pound

   1) I watched what I ate, non-fat cottage cheese, chicken, beef, fish, quinoa, lentils

   2) I used (still do) protein and creatine. I take fish oil and flax.

   3) Cardio was done on the eliptical machine cause I hate  running

I started out by going from Regular pop to diet. Diet then later became either water
Then I cut back on pastas and bread. I didn't do a full Atkins diet. I just went off the premise I was probably taking in way to many carbs. I eat more now days but nothing like donuts. Fruits and Veggies when I can of course. 

Workout really isn't much. I work at a factory now and so I walk about 5-6 miles a day. I haven't even started up a steady work out routine yet. I will walk around our park or do some push ups from time to time but yea. It's been a slow process but it's yielded me progress.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

-[Lat pulldowns](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/CBFrontPulldown.html). There are key differences between the lat pulldown machine and a pull-up. The biggest one is that [lat pulldowns are open-chain

-[Assisted pull-up machine](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/AsPullup.html). While I like it better than the lat pulldown and it's a decent exercise, plus you recruit a lot of muscles as stabilizers and synergists (i.e. abs) that you don't really tap into with the assisted machine. It's just a very different movement. With a pull-up, you're retracting your scapulae and pulling *back* (more on this in a bit), on the assisted machine, because of how the counterweight works you're pulling more upward. ETA: A lot of people are commenting about the assisted machine. I do think it's a decent exercise for building a base of strength, and it's certainly better than lat pulldowns, but you will probably reach a point where you have to switch to something else to bridge to a full pull-up. I once helped a girl who wasn't strong enough to even do a single rack chin; if you're that weak the assisted machine might be a decent option.

WHAT I DO LIKE:

-[Rack chins](http://imgur.com/LHRcR) (that picture shows them with a barbell

-[Inverted rows](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BWSupineRow.html). These hit the back muscles a bit differently

-Jump pull-ups with slow negatives. Jump up to the top position and sloooowly lower yourself down. As you get better you'll be able to pull yourself up at the top part (the hardest part is overcoming the inertia at the bottom). I really like these for ""greasing the groove"". You don't necessarily have to do them to failure

-[Band-assisted pull-ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmLa2czq49Y). I like these because they just assist you at the bottom (the hardest part) rather than helping you the whole way through. I like these for when you're able to do partial ROM pull-ups but not a full one.

-Push-ups

KEYS TO PROPER FORM

-Supinated

-Focus on retracting your scapulae and pulling back!!

-For inverted rows

-For rack chins, but it's better if you don't.

INCORPORATING THIS INTO A ROUTINE

SL 5x5: Replace barbell rows with 3xF supine rows in workout A and add 3xF push-ups to failure. Add 3xF rack chins for workout B. ""Grease the groove"" with jump pull-ups to negatives (or just find some time during the week where you can do them). Once you can do partial ROM pull-ups

SS: Basically the same as above

Hope this helps someone!

1362933433.0,1a11cc,The German Volume Training Experiment: Completed,SWATtheory,626,154,113,"Hello again fittit, unfortunately for me

THE WORKOUT:
I used the original can be found here: http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/441/German_Volume_Training.aspx

And before you ask, you repeat day one, you don't go M through F then rest all weekend.)

BACKGROUND:

I'll keep this short and simple. My background is a fatass who got into shape. This was and was me: [http://i.imgur.com/Duf7c.jpg
](http://i.imgur.com/Duf7c.jpg)

My routine before this was a modified SS program that I made work for me

I really have no expertise in lifting (high school or otherwise)

METHODOLOGY:

The idea behind the routine, and an ""intermediate"" half where you do 10 sets of 6 reps.

DIET &amp; SUPPLEMENTS:

This is pretty important. You gotta eat. More than probably what you just though. I ate a LOT of food. On days where I wasn't forced to eat fast food (seriously

Also

The supplements I took itemized:

* Package containing Oxan-VR

* Orange Triad multivitamin

* Mega Shred fish oil

* Assault pre-workout

* Anabolic 60 whey 

DISCUSSION:

I was warned going into this that it is incredibly brutal. After doing it, but there are a few things that would concern me:

* Lack of discipline - this routine will pound your will power into the ground. If you aren't as mentally strong as you are physically

* Lack of proper form - it is VERY important you have good form while doing all of these lifts. I almost injured myself due to misunderstanding ""bent knee deadlifts"" was actually ""Romanian Deadlifts"" and attempted to slowly lower heavier than necessary deadlift weight.

* Failure to adhere to tempo - This is incredibly important - you can power through the workout no problem

* Not knowing your limits - there were 3 instances of the 60 day span where I had failed during my lifts, providing a sore rib cage for a couple days. The last one was the bent over rows I was having difficulty doing correctly the first day.

* Joint pain - as you probably guessed

PROGRESSION:

The program went fairly well I think.

RESULTS:

I did all of my core lifts before going into the GVT program. The numbers before and after stayed remarkably the same

SQUAT - 315x5x3

OHP - 135x5x3

DEADLIFT - 405x5x1

BENCH - 225x5x3

PC - 185x5x3

I would also like to report there was no loss of strength during this program

Workout:

I did my best to combine a heavy amount of cardio with a decent amount of weights. My schedule usually 
looked like this.

Monday/Wednesday: AM - Upper body lifts and a bike ride
PM - Rec League Ultimate Frisbee (Awesome source of cardio)

Tuesday/Thursday: AM - Canoe/Swim (I live on a lake during the summer)
PM - Pickup Soccer

Friday: AM - Weights and Bikeride

Saturday/Sunday - Usually fit in some sort of exercise on one day and then rested on the other.

Diet:
I ate what I wanted usually
Cut out pretty much all dairy.
Ate no forms of dessert.

Overhead press(5*5) : 95lb to 125lb

Bench press (1rm) : 135 to 245



Edit: 

I've been doing the SL 5*5 for overhead press along with Squats constantly. As far as benching goes

I got a comment about my bench being way over my squats (my posted weight for squats is 5*5 while bench is my 1rm)

As far as diet goes.. I wasn't focusing on diet for the first month or two

Edit again*

A decent amount of people are skeptical about my bench press but hopefully this provides some more info behind it..

I benched a decent amount in high school and spontaenously stopped at 195.
Coming back to the gym a few months ago

Now my chest size is also something ive been concerned about but its because prior to this I had a concave chest (ribs cave in making a significant ditch in my chest). Fat/muscle had to fill that void before any of my chest started sticking out. A lot of my lifting buddies that are 1rm'ing way less than me have nicer chests than me because of this.

I had vowed to be in the best shape of my life when I turned 30

*EDIT:* Workout and diet details added below. 

**WORKOUT ROUTINE**

**Day 1:** Biceps, Cardio (all exercises are x3 sets)

* Underhand pull-ups (10 reps)
* Dumbell shoulder shrugs (25 reps)
* T-Bar rows (10 reps)
* Reverse dumbell fly
* Dumbell lateral raises (15 reps)
* Cable rows (12 reps)
* Barbell curls (12 reps - last set to failure)
* 30-45 minutes of cardio

**Day 2:** Chest

* Bench press
* Dumbell incline press (10 reps)
* Chest fly (10 reps)
* Dips (10 reps)
* Tricep kickbacks (12 reps each arm)
* Tricep pulldowns with rope (12 reps)
* Push ups (25 reps - last set to failure)
* 30-45 minutes of cardio

**Day 3:** Abs

* Scissor kick holds (5 reps per leg
* One leg toe-touches (10 right / 10 left)
* Side plank (30 seconds each side)
* Seated medicine ball twists (15 reps each direction)
* Roman chair knee raises (10 reps)
* Roman chair straight leg raises (10 reps)
* 30-45 minutes of cardio

**Day 4:** Rest day

------------------------------------------------------------

Up to this point I have avoided leg exercises due to knee issues, anyway).

------------------------------------------------------------

**DIET GUIDELINES**

I'm actually not super strict about my diet. I just use basic principles to get through the day.

* Drink lots of water.
* Avoid saturated fats MOST of the time (cheese, dressings, etc.)
* Avoid starches and simple carbs MOST of the time (potatoes, chips, crackers, etc.)
* Eat as many fresh fruits
* Try to consume roughly 150 grams of protein.
* Allow myself a cheat meal a couple of times per week. It's not that serious.

I've tried the 6 small meals thing, a sizable dinner, and a small protein/carb snack after my evening workout. I intentionally skip breakfast because it tends to upset my stomach. At most I'll have a cup of coffee with no sugar.

It may come as a surprise that I actually eat out most of the time for lunch and dinner. I frequent places like Chick Fil-A (grilled nuggets), Cafe Express (turkey burger on wheat bun), and Taco Cabana (chicken fajita tacos on corn tortillas). Yes, it's more expensive than I'd like, but that's the price I pay - literally - for convenience.


**SUPPLEMENTS**

I drink a protein shake on days when I see that I'm going to come up a little short in that area. I prefer the Frosty Chocolate flavor offered by Pure Protein.

Since then

Here are three progress pictures. I attempted to keep lighting and posing similar (though no pose before I started lifting): 

http://i.imgur.com/ZzdzU.png

The pictures are from End of Feb

Weights are approximately 165

I started lifting shortly after the first picture was taken. My routine was basically SS minus deadlifts (my back just doesn't like deadlifts)

I didn't really have a diet plan and just ate whatever

Around june I decided I didn't like the routine or my diet and got serious. I switched to a 3 day split (push/pull/legs) and I've been using it religiously since. I also use a fairly consistent diet now that's high in protein and low in fat.

I think I started to see real progress from here out. I decide to cut/recomposition until the start of august after doing some reading online

Pretty happy with the results; what do you guys think?

How I feel: http://i.imgur.com/tO5yq.jpg

Current routine:

Push: Flat Barbell bench, Machine flyes, Shoulder Press (dumbbell or machine), Tricep pulldown, Lateral raises (dumbbell) 

Pull: Dumbbell bicep curls, Rows (I vary these between dumbbell rows, seated cable rows and machine rows), Reverse barbell curls, Barbell curls, Shrugs (dumbbell or barbell), rear delt flyes (dumbbell or machine)  

Legs: Squats, Leg extensions, Leg curls.



Lifts: Bench: 95 -&gt; 180 (10 reps)
Squat: 135 -&gt; 265 (10 reps)


Body changes: I only have a few, waist has gone from 33 -&gt; 28 inches.

Neck 15.25
Chest 42
Arms 15.75
Forearms 13.25

Quads 23.5
Calves 15.5
Ankle 8.5


EDIT 2: Thanks so much for the comments guys. A lot of these have really made my day!


I'll try to get back to as many people as I can


Edit 3: No

I was incredibly athletic in the past though. It wasn't until university kicked my ass that I got incredibly out of shape. 

I worked incredibly hard for these results. I've been dedicated to the cause since I started and am going to continue to see where I can push myself.

If you don't believe it




*PSA*: My lovely girlfriend has replied in the comments for those interested (Cherbear002)



Edit 4: I now realize that I hadn't mentioned my level of fitness in highschool. When I was 16 I had a home gym with a bench press, but now that I think about it it probably contributed to my gains. It was almost 9 years ago now though (my mother removed the gym shortly after I got into it); it didn't really cross my my mind when I made the thread.

I also have my black belt in taekwondo

1337268187.0,trqu2,An account of my first marathon and some poop,draney5,655,195,162,"In 2009, past most of the historical landmarks while beginning and ending at The Colosseum.

Getting to the point, repeat.

The race starts, water, and have a couple of port-a-johns. Both of the shitters are in use, so I just jog in place to stay warm and wait it out. Looking back on it, I’m not sure if I was sweating more from the run or from this anxious turd pushing on my gut. Finally the door unlocks and out walks an incredibly good looking brunette. As the door is shutting behind her, I notice she left a gift. All over the back of the toilet seat is a nice warm pile of shit. It wasn’t a healthy solid one, no

Like I said, and my body told me that was going to have to do.

Now I’ve always heard my wife and her friend's talk about squatting to avoid the toilet seat. I’ve never tried it before

I pull my sweaty shorts down around my ankles and brace my hands upon the sidewalls of the pot. I can start to hear other runners congregate outside the port-a-john and converse. Knowing there is a line forming doesn’t make this any easier for me.

Slowly

After running twelve miles

Now I’m sitting in somebody elses poop. I make my peace with this and continue to shit my brains out. I can hear the congregation outside growing larger. I go to wipe and of course there’s no fucking toilet paper. It was either used up by the faster runners ahead of me or was never there in the first place. It doesn’t matter now. No amount of toilet paper will make me feel clean again.

So, and ran back into the race. I made no eye contact with the next guy/girl in line as I exit. I just get out of the situation as fast as I can.

I can only assume, and that they also finished the race with shitty ass. Instead of a beautiful women’s poop, it now belongs to some American asshole who used all of the toilet paper.

TL;DR: I probably have AIDS

upper body: http://i.imgur.com/2TxAP.jpg

My equipment:

- das men's health muskelbuch (german)
- dumbbells (by ktec
- yoga mat
- my motivation

I just want to share this because I want to show you people that you don't need an expensive gym-subscription (well in switzerland it's pretty expensive

and btw: I need the hipster glasses to see :P

have a nice day


MASSIVE EDIT: Holy sh/t... never thought this would get so many comments. I will post my workout here (was asked a few times). Don't be mad at me when I can't answer all of your comments. And have a heart


So things first off: 

- weight at start: ~64kg

- I know the lighting is not superb

- I didn't take any supplements and I did not have a diet. I can eat whatever I want, cookies and that stuff).

- For those who call ""bullshit on this one"". Keep in mind that I didn't miss 1 single day of workout since 3 months. It was my only motivation because I don't have a girlfriend at the moment

- The bedroom is in my parents house and yes

- I'm an asthmatic. I did focus on my upper body simply because I wanted to see my first results there. I was a sprinter (athlete) in my youth and used to play floorball till this summer. So my legs were already pretty fit

- equipment I forgot to mention: pull up bar (in between door)

And finally... a detailed workout plan (remember I'm not doing a diet

On mondays

- Number 1: alternate dumbbell curls (10 per hand) then 10 pushups -&gt; break of 1 minute between curls -&gt; repeat 5 times
- break
- Number 2: 10 sit-ups then 10 overhead triceps curls (don't know how to translate that one
- break
- Number 1 once again
- break
- Number 3: Tony Horton P90x Ab Ripper X (forget to mention this on in equipment
- break
- Number 1 once again
- break
- Number 4: 10 chin ups with 10 pushups afterwards -&gt; break -&gt; repeat 5 - 10 times

equals: 150 bicep curls, 200+ pushups, 50-100 chin ups (they are the hardest).

time used: depends on breaks you take. I can do it fast in 45' or relaxed in 1h 15'

tuesdays and thursdays:

- 30 minutes running (outside)

- 30 minutes biking (outdoor in summer

- Some pushups and chinups

time used: ~1h

saturdays:

- free to choose of above exercises (I rarely do much at weekends)


EDIT 2: Thanks for all the nice words (mainly nice ;)) and it really makes me happy when I can motivate some of you to do the same. Just keep in mind that over the last few months this was really my only goal to achieve and I had plenty of time to spend. But as mentioned in the workout

EDIT 3: For those who wonder why the weight gain is so little. I can't really explain it either. I guess it's because I lost some of the lower body muscles.

EDIT 4: Legs by now

I started this journey on Feb 9 at 372. My first 6 weeks I did a regular low fat diet with 4 days cardio(walking) and 4 days weights. I always have 1 complete off day. The next 4.5 months were spent doing Keto with a weekly refeed(anything I want). Training remained the same with some jogging.  Standard split in the weight room with no squats and lightly deadlifting once every 3 weeks. These last 3 months have been insane(the good kind). I started a modified SL routine. Diet turned to TKD. I take in 25g carbs before workout and 50g after. I do cardio on the 3 off days in the morning. One is a 40 minute walk/slight jog. One is a 40 minute walk. And the other I run a nonstop 5k. Twice a week I warmup with a Prowler and sled session. On Thanksgiving I will switch to a standard diet again to see what the carbs can do for me. I will be eating at a very small deficit as Im happy at this weight. I just need to get the BF lower. I'm naturally a big guy and thats where I'm the most comfortable. Skinny fat is not for me. When I started I wore a size 50 pants. Now Im at a size 36. There was one area where I gained a couple inches. Lets just say my wife doesnt mind that one. She has also lost 50 pounds.

Diet is 1800 cals on non gym days and 2200 on gym days.

Routine is (forgive the format


Workout A

Squats

Hang cleans to push press

Deadlifts

Shrugs


Workout B

Squats

Bench 

Pull ups

Superset x 5, and a tri exercise.

EDIT:
Thanks for the input guys. It helps a lot. Now I finally know what's my problem. I didn't have much lean body mass to begin with when I lost my initial 50lbs without incorporating any weight lifting routine. Then

A lot of people recommended that I stop cutting and start bulking. I'll try to do it next month since I'm having my medical exam in weeks time. It's been 3 long years that I barred myself from eating excessively and I'm quite excited and afraid for this new regime. I want to see result but at the same time I'm quite apprehensive about the fat gain. When you lost that amount of fat in your liftetime

Bulking is new to me. My maintenance calorie from some websites is around ~2300-2500kcal. So in order to do a clean bulk, I usually maintain a daily intake of 180g or so.

EDIT2:
A lot of people do not believe my squats. This is the only picture I can find on my phone now with my legs bare. The person besides me also gyms but he seldom squats. It's not huge but comparison is there. I like squat because it helps you to lose weight. It's the first workout I did when I started weight lifting.

Mr. Rippetoe has a lot of valuable experience and knowledge about strength training. He also has misconceptions

Just because he is wrong about one thing

Likewise

Use your fucking brain. Apply some judgment and think about what you want to get out of your training. Slurping on his balls every chance you get and being a hip anti-Rip are both stupid if they will interfere with your fitness goals. In either case

- [King Oyster](http://examine.com/supplements/King+Oyster/) is a mushroom with the weirdest bloody testosterone boosting study I have read
- [Hovenia Dulcis](http://examine.com/supplements/Hovenia+dulcis/) is an 'anti-alcohol' herb that appears to be able to reduce circulating blood alcohol levels in man when pre-loaded

Anywho

- I can find no evidence of negative feedback

- I can not find any evidence suggesting withdrawal or dependence on melatonin. Admittedly a *ton* of studies are done over the short term and with no follow-up, and no tolerance for up to 6 months of usage of 2mg melatonin

- Toxicity threshold is hella high; there are human studies of 100mg (50-fold higher than normal dose) of melatonin being taken with no adverse effects (aside from sedation); based on this and the three above bullet points

- Melatonin is **not** a reliable agent for improving sleep **quality**. It **is** a reliable agent for decreasing sleep **latency**. It knocks you out

- Melatonin's benefits appear to be half through melatonin itself (acting on 2-4 melatonin receptors) and the other part just benefits that are secondary to a proper circadian rhythm.

- Does not appear to significantly influence body composition (fat mass nor muscle mass)

- Significantly intertwined with leptin signalling

- May help tinnitus slightly but significantly; that's bloody awesome

A post I've been so eager to make is finally here. I used to think growing up that I was ""big built"". As you can see

But this is the single most eventful day of my life - the day I long dreamed about for years and years. Today this is it - and today I am celebrating (with a glass of water!)

First and foremost
==&gt; http://imgur.com/xiZ81.jpg

It contains all the details.

The day before I started my diet
Big Stomach Gut

Back Pains from bending down

Psoriasis Worsening

Look unattractive

Cannot wear clothes I like

Stretchmarks all over my body

Chest pains breathing time to time

Wheezing to get deep breaths in after eating

Scared of Diabetes

Growing depression

No confidence in myself

Fear of dying early



How did I do it? Really simple. I just ate differently.
You are what you eat. I used to hear that so much - and I used
to hate that so much at the same time.

To explain the diet bluntly:
- Fruits
- Lean Meats
- Veggies
- Caloric Restriction
- No refined/processed crap. No carbs. No starch. No soda

Pretty simple. Nothing to it. Not sure why people make it more complicated than it needs to be.

Calorie cycling also helped to overcome any ""plateaus"".


But now here I am - younger, ready to take
on more of the world at 24 (and hopefully my body hasn't taken a toll on my lifespan as a result of the obesity...)

What's next? I'm maintaining. As you can tell
on purpose. I need some mass to work with - I haven't done ANY
weight training. I need to start. ASAP. 

Now it's time for me to plan my next attack: Getting ripped.

I hope this inspires you all. Please don't hesitate to comment. 

I'm going to the laser clinic right now for an appointment - to
see what they can do about my stretchmarks. :)

GROSS: But are there actual exercises besides running that you've stopped doing because of the research that you've read?

REYNOLDS: Not really. What I have started doing are exercises that I actually thought were unhealthy and turned out not to be. I do squats, they burn calories, they build the muscles in your legs and your bottom.**

They make you stronger. It's also the squat is essentially an exercise that can guarantee that you will be independent all through your lifespan, and you become unable to get up out of your chair. If you're doing squats, you will always be able to stand up.

So I now do 20 squats at least a few times a week. I don't use weights. You don't have to hold a dumbbell. Just squat down

GROSS: So when you say squats you mean like deep knee bends? Same?

REYNOLDS: Yes

GROSS: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

REYNOLDS: And if that's hard...

GROSS: I had heard those are really bad for your knees

REYNOLDS: And they're not.

GROSS: They're not. OK.

REYNOLDS: In fact, don't go all the way down until your thighs are parallel to the ground.

Maybe keep your thighs at a 60 degree angle to the ground, it should make your knees stronger. You can also, if you find a regular squat really difficult, do what are called wall squats, meaning you lean against the wall and go up and down. Then when that's easy, move away from the wall, do 20. It really has made a big difference, in my leg strength.",t5_2qhx4,True

Do whatever you want


I am not stating that no lift substitutions can or should be done. Doing something like subbing incline bench for bench press, but if you do not have the training knowledge or common sense to figure this out yourself, you should just be doing the routine as written.

I receive tons of emails and PM’s, but more often than not, these are guys that are beginners, or low intermediate level lifters that are so far away from even having a remote handle on their diet, training and rest that it is ridiculous to even think about this stuff. But think they do. Often to the point of so much focus on the little stuff, that the big picture items are totally lost in the background with perhaps the thought that it’s these little details that are holding them back instead of their faulty training and horrendous diet. Is this you?




**Edit** - I like the constructive criticism, that I actually encourage people to experiment and have fun with their routines and diets, but not at the cost of their goals and spinning their wheels. If you need variation to keep things fresh and interesting, and that keeps you going back to the gym, excellent.

Alrighty. In this post I am going to summarize my complete journey from a skinny “Do you even lift?” kid to where I am today. I’ll tell you how I got there and share all I have learned along the way
	.
I first got interested in building some muscle when I was about 17. I worked out with a bench in my basement and got **some** results, protein, or anything. I didn’t look so great. Here’s some pics from that time period, spring of my senior year of high school:

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/aPKYM) body weight: about 150 lb

I’m the blonde kid. Yeah

Flash forward a few months and I get to college, I hit the gym every day and gave it 100%. Sadly that didn’t matter because my routine sucked and my diet was the same as before, I was obsessed with having abs so I severly limit my intake. No tracking of protein or any other macronutrients. Here’s where this got me after about six months:

[Album]( http://imgur.com/a/GZINe) Body weight was about 150 lb

As you can see I had some abdominal definition, girlfriend, undergraduate research completely taking over my life. I was no longer limiting my food intake however, and was eating whatever I wanted with a healthy appetite. 

After my time off, I was flabby and out of shape. I weighed about 185 lb. Not huge for 6'2''.

I decided one day that it was time to change, pretty much all the meat I want, and not a lot of carbs. Maybe a half cup of oatmeal a day. I don’t have any progress pics from the start of this period, I wish I did, it would be interesting to see. 

I found r/fitness (the best thing that ever happened to me fitness wise) and took in  and applied the new information. I started doing squats (albeit not to parallel), but I always gave it my all in the weightroom. For every exercise I would do 5 sets of 10 reps, hitting every body part. I split my workout into a shoulder/legs day; bicep/back day; and tricep chest/day. I also did HIIT cardio (sprinting) because I thought it would magically give me abs. After about six months of that I got to here:

[Spring 2008](http://imgur.com/a/8eTvE) Body weight about 190 lb

Well, bench, deadlift, ohp, and power clean, which is the essence behind SS and SL. What I did was essentially do two compound barbell movements every workout. For example I’d have a squat/ohp day; deadlift/power clean; and a bench/squat day. My routine might have looked something like this:

Day A: Squat 5 X 5; OHP 5X5; Dumbbell shoulder press 5 X 10; pull ups 5  X AMRAP(As Many Reps As Possible)

Day B: deadlift 5 X 5; power clean 5 X 5; dumbbell bicep curl 5 X 10; chin ups 5 X AMRAP; dumbbell rows 1 X AMRAP

Day C: Squat 5 X 5; barbell bench press 5 X 5; dumbbell bench press 5 X 5; pull ups 5 X AMRAP

Then take a rest day

During this period I was eating

[Fall 2011](http://imgur.com/a/nQBLC#0) body weight about 200 lb

Yep, also notice I was doing pull ups/chin ups every workout. I think that was a smart move on my part. But I was still just getting started. Here I am a few months later after doing a little bulk and a cut

[Spring 2012](http://imgur.com/a/cYHZc#0) weigh about 190 lb in these pics

I cut a little more after this point, but I would guess 3600 kCal. I Always I hit at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. My training switched over to 5/3/1. As per 5/3/1 instructions, I tested my 1RM on all my lifts, they were: Squat 330; Deadlift 405; Bench 270; and OHP 160. 

So I kept up with 531 and eating like a horse for a long time. I broke up the bench press progression with some cycles of smolov jr. After about 6 months my 1RM’s were: Squat 375lb; Deadlift 450 lb; Bench 300 lb; and OHP 175 lb. Cool. So I kept on trucking with that. I stepped up the intensity of my workouts, 440 X 6, and 405 X 10; OHP 190 X 1; bench didn’t move much. Here’s how I looked after all of that:

[Fall 2012](http://imgur.com/a/SEJza#0) weighed 220 lb at this time

In about a year I had gotten bigger and a shit ton stronger. I also realized I fucking sucked at powerlifting. My numbers were garbage from some one who weighed 220 lb and I was getting sick of low rep sets. So I decided to cut and focus on hypertrophy training. Time to see what muscle I had built under this fat. I scaled back the calories to 2300 kCal/day and started doing PHAT. This has taken me to where I am right now

[A few weeks ago](http://imgur.com/a/BJDWj#0) body weight is around 195 to 205 depending on how much water im holding and if I need to take a dumper.

I’m very happy with how I look today. I've surpassed what I've ever though was possible

**TL;DR** I went from [this](http://imgur.com/fWbNaIf) to [this](http://imgur.com/7n6Szts)

I thought I would share my fitness journey from the ages of 18 to where I am now (23).

Throughout my whole teenage years I was pretty significantly overweight. It was pretty tough going through puberty - I always had loads of friends and was pretty happy but I had no success with the ladies.

I got to about 18 and pretty much all my friends we doing stuff with their girlfriends and I was sitting at home with my greasy long hair playing WoW

[Me age 18](http://imgur.com/a/HnWSR)

I think I was around 16 or 17 stone (~100kg / 220lbs) of pure fat here.

I started with mostly cardio. I went running every day and started eating healthy. I lost a massive amount of weight pretty quickly and by the time I was 19 and heading to Uni I was pretty skinny. I stayed pretty skinny for a few years until I got into weightlifting.

I've been training for just over a year and I've seen some impressive changes. I've actually just started bulking to add some mass to my frame (I'll let you know how it goes). I still eat clean and drink loads of water while lifting 3 x week.

Here is me now;

I started working out in November 2011. About 3 months later I noticed a sharp pain in my left knee when I squatted and when I walked up and down stairs. I figured it was just a symptom of my not great noob form. so I fixed my form and it never went away. Not even after months of good form. 

I finally went to the doc and the X-rays showed that I have a [Bone Spur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteophyte) AKA osteophyte. Apparently I developed it early on during a growth spurt when I was 12 or 13. The doc asked me if I had started working out recently. When I told him I had he explained that the reason I am just now experiencing the pain was because my muscle had finally grown so big that it getting aggravated by the spur. It will take a quick out patient procedure to grind the spur down and I'll be back to normal in no time.

Just thought it was awesome that I was getting so big I was hurting myself.

**Beef &amp; Broccoli bowl**

* ~250g of round steak

* 1tbl canola oil

* ~1.5cups of chopped broccoli

* ~2tbl A1 sauce + a bit of Worcestershire

* 1 clove of garlic

* Small handful of cheese curd (garlic is best)

Cube up the meat, and A1.  Keep it warm until the broccoli is done then throw the curds into the pan so they warm up.  Dump it all onto a dish, grind some pepper on there and enjoy.  

 
* ~750cal, 36g Fat (half is from the cooking oil).

Total cost: about $4.50.  Takes 10-15 mins from prep to eating.  Tastes pretty damned good actually.  I grab a forkful of broccoli and stab into some meat and cheese and enjoy.  Looks kind of nasty I guess.

Rehab centers often get left with the responsibility of treating mental health as well as getting people off drugs and back into society. There are very few mental health services for the poor and this is something I care deeply about.

Just wanted to post this to motivate anyone I can. Left is before, and I did. If you're overweight, underweight, or generally not happy with yourself STOP MAKING EXCUSES; you can do anything you put your mind to! Motivate yourself and just do it, stop telling yourself you will do it tomorrow, and just start today. One thing I have learned over the past couple months is that how ever much you put into it, is how much you will get out of it; and this goes for ANYTHING in life. So get out there, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!





**EDIT**: I'm going to just edit my original post here because I'm seeing a good amount of the same questions and comments. 

-I do not lift a large amount of weight, and I do around 200 on the chest press machine (up from about 85-90lbs). I curl around 100lbs (up from about 60lbs), I curl 40lbs when I use dumbbells and max at 45lbs (up from using 15-20lbs). I use 40-45lb dumbbells for shoulder press (up from 20 lbs). I push around 130 on upright rows (up from about 60-70lbs).

-I would like to clarify that I was not going for mass or a ""huge"" look, since I have begun plateauing I will be changing my regiment soon to be doing more squats, deadlifts, and heavier lifting to break the plateau. 

-Mostly I do alot of dumbbell exercises and natural body lifting like all different types of pushups, oh and I rock climb (not religiously though).


TL;DR EDIT: I wasn't trying to get huge, dips and pushups, etc. I have plateaued and will be lifting heavier to break it.

I completely saw where they were coming from and they were absolutely right, adding 10lbs per week up till 225.  Then I wanted to speed things up and jumped to 275 this week.

So after their talk, trying to see where my form was going to shit, 135 looked and felt okay, 185 looked good and 225 okay.  I ended up thanking them again after I left and coming back to the realization, (obviously) **form is everything**.  

So it looks like I'm gonna be working my way back up from 225 again, and in reality they were looking out for me.

Fast forward a few months, despite training 4 times a week, protein shakes as every snack and bulking up on the right foods. I wasn't feeling any better, I was feeling worse. I was steadily becoming more lethargic, tired, and nauseated. At first I thought it was just my new promotion at work that was stressing me out, all the extra pressure riding on my shoulders dragging me down. Also included could be the pressure from my girlfriend (at the time) to see her more and more and keep up with her.... Wouldn't say demands
This continued for some time, I wasn't gaining anything. I went to the doctor about it, and I had tests run for Diabetes, Cancer, HIV, others I can't even remember. Zero results given.


Forward about 6 months again (9 months from approximate contraction of tapeworm), but I barely had the energy for that, even. As a result, we fought more and more, until I eventually couldn't bear to see her cry and be disappointed with my pitiful efforts anymore, and ended things with her. 

I went to ER wondering what the fuck was going on with my health, estimated to be 6 metres long (I think that's 18ft) and nine months old. It's been removed now, and we're about 4 months down the track from this all happening. I'm still single (my supposed ""love of my life"" had found another man within 3 weeks, AN OLD FRIEND EVEN) and I am looking like all hell.

First I just wanted to say thanks for everybody here for great advice and support.

I used to workout in high school and a few years in my twenties but really let things go in my thirties. After waking up on my fortieth birthday in the winter (2012) with a sharp back pain

My height is 5'7""

I don't know my weight in the Spring and Summer photos because I just didn't care then. My weight now is around 150 lbs

Food: My take on food is very colorful fresh vegetables (kale, holland peppers, swiss chard, scallions, wild mushrooms), lean meats (steak, pork, organic free range eggs

Supplements: None. My stomach is sensitive and I don't trust ingesting anything packaged or processed even if it's a vitamin. I try to get everything from my meals and snacks.

Before my workout I walk fast on the treadmill for six minutes. Then I stretch and also do some dynamic stretches.

Because of a high school wrestling shoulder problem

I don't really keep track of my reps or weight. I just go by feel and try to go hard as I can on every set and workout. Sorry I'm not more specific.

Workout: Basic Four Day Split

Mon: Back / Bi's / Forearms -- Pull ups 4 sets, Lat Pull down 4 sets, Kroc row 3 sets, Palm in close grip lat pull downs 3 sets, Barbell Curls 3 sets, Hammer Curls 3 sets, Seated dumbbell curls

Tues: Shoulders / Traps / Abs -- Dumbbell OHP 5 sets, Dumbbell Bent Over Rear Raise 3 Sets, Dumbbell Shrugs, Crunches 4 Sets, Cable Crunches 4 sets. If I have energy I'll add two or three calf exercises.

Thurs: Legs -- Squats 5 sets, Leg Extensions 3 sets, Leg Press 3 sets, Three calf exercises for 12 sets.

Fri: Chest / Tris -- Incline Dumbbell Press 5 sets, Machine Flyes 3 sets, Machine Press 3 sets, Skull Crushers 4 sets, Pull Down Extensions 4 sets.

My goal right now is to bulk and start cutting in the Spring.

All feedback is welcome and thanks again for a great community.

Edit: I wanted to say the best thing about getting in shape is that I started dating my gf when I was a slob and now she says she would have never guessed that this is how I would turn out and that she got a great deal. Whenever she sees me with my shirt off she says

**If you want my advice here it is

Take it slow, drinking soda, etc is the default and when you decide to start eating vegetables, fruit, and chicken/fish it is a ""diet."" Really you should think of eating healthy food as humans default setting and eating junk food as something outside of the norm.  For me it took a very long time of slowly weening myself off of junk, I am currently on a very efficient diet of Kashi cereal breakfast, banana snack, celery/carrots snack, but now I feel like my body is running better then it ever has before.

I basically ran Layne Norton's PHAT this summer, to 135 now (11% BF? ). I kept the drinking down to a minimum, about once or twice a month, and that's what I think really helped me lose that BF%. It sucks that shitty bench technique has significantly screwed up my shoulder progress, but stretching and warming up is really helping me come back. I hope to increase my puny leg strength even more, now that I've gotten over being scared to squat/DL, and help my shoulders catch up on all the growth they've missed (My rear delts are MIA!...)

For all you people out here on this community giving out free advice and helping each other out, but I'm down to answer any questions anyone has! (Whether it be about the mistakes I made, or the good decisions I made :) )

Little backstory: Scrawny seems to be the natural state for the men in my family. We're blessed (and cursed) with a rather extreme metabolism. We can eat anything anytime and as much of it as we possibly can

After being dumped by my girlfriend and dumping my addiction to MMORPG's on the same day late last November I decided to basically reinvent myself physically and mentally. It was an effort to try and discover who I really was away from what I used to be which I realized was horribly dysfunctional and self harming.

I was completely new to the topic of lifting weights so during December I lifted light and focused more on proper form. Not that I had much choice though. When I started I couldn't do a dip, and maybe 10 push-ups. I sought to educate myself as much as possible if I was going to commit to this. I lurked here, found other sources, and picked my brother's brain as he took me under his wing. When 2012 hit I made it a goal to hit 160lbs by my birthday (about a pound a week). And without droning on too much more here are my confidence boosting [results.](http://i.imgur.com/tvyhO.jpg)

*The 'before' pic is already one month in of going to the gym. My normal weight is 135lbs (I'm 5'10"" for clarity)

**What I did:**

* Stopped eating out as much and started eating anything and everything I could at home.
* After I started to plateau early March at ~154lbs I made it a goal to hit 4000 calories a day and started counting them using myfitnesspal. I also took GNC's Re-Built Mass after I realized 4000 calories a day is absurd. Every other day though
* My workout regimen I got from my other brother who is in the USAF. The only way to describe it is brutal and certainly not for beginners. It's easier to show you than explain it actually so I'll do just that. None of us use this program anymore so the secrets haven't much use to us now.

We all hear that exercise is vital to overcoming depression. Great. I forced myself to go running or lift weights, and I envied those people who seemed full of energy and were in great shape.


Then, but I knew I couldn't maintain a schedule of something I didn't enjoy doing. Seeing as how I was in the middle of an interesting novel, I decided to bring that book with me and read while I did some light pedaling on the stationary bike. I figured this wouldn't really do much in terms of exercise because I had the resistance way down and I wasn't pushing as hard as I could. So I ended up reading for a bit; I could tell that my heart rate was up, but I never really got out of breath. Before I knew it I had finished two chapters, 30 minutes had gone by and I was drenched in sweat. And I felt great! It was honestly the first time I had enjoyed working out.


So the next day, so I was able to bike for another 20-30 minutes and had another great experience. I kept this up every day and I actually LOOKED FORWARD TO GOING TO THE GYM (never thought I would say that). Each day was more productive than the last. I no longer wished I had the energy to go do homework or go out with friends. I was eating less than I ever thought I could survive on. I just wasn't hungry, and I had more energy than I ever have had in my life. I finally felt like I could relate to all those super athletic guys who are always positive. I had become one of them!


Eventually, a couple days later I found myself working through a bag of potato chips watching tv and just feeling too lazy to do anything. One quick trip to the bike fixed that feeling.




So, but try to enjoy the experience. Don't work so hard that you're panting for breath by the time you leave. Find something that you can enjoy doing for 20-30 minutes, because this is (from my experience and research) the time needed for cardio to be fully effective. There is no magical amount of exercise that will help you. You can't just work out and try to get it over with as quickly as possible. If you don't enjoy your workout, you will dread going to the gym, and you won't go. Trust me. I finally discovered riding a bike with almost no resistance (I've since turned up the resistance as I develop more muscle), and reading a book, since I would get bored thinking about nothing for 30 minutes. For you, or while watching a TV show. Or walk a few times around a lake. Or swim peacefully while blasting classical music from a boombox.

But find something that works. Because exercise is honestly the only thing that I've ever found to help me


**TL;DR:** Exercise is the only thing that has ever helped my depression

Edit: I wanted to throw in a reply to a comment I made, built shelter, and played sports. All of these activities are mentally engaging as well as physically. Now that we have a steady supply of food from the supermarket, and lead individual lives which normally don't include sports or building our own shelters, we have no need for exercise. This is why I think our society has such a problem with obesity and depression. Our lives have been made so comfortable that exercise is no longer necessary. Thus, exercising just for the sake of exercising without any kind of purpose (like hunting an animal or building something) can often feel boring and pointless. The key to enjoying your workout (imo) is to find an activity that engages you mentally as well as physically.

People reading this probably don't know much about me, 2007.  I had only been in Boston a little over two months at that point.  My life was so different; no masters degree, I hadn't even done my first bulk or cut yet.  I was probably about 173 lbs at that point, at about 11% bf.  So here it is with the first page folded out, and the last page on the left.  The little perforated parts ripped a bit on both of them so they're loose leaf now, but they'll go into my folder with all my other old workout logs/sheets/plans.  It's great to see the progress; if you look at the workout on 11/19, my incline bench peak was 145 lbs. for 7 reps, if I would ever get to push the big big weights.  I had improved my diet, would I ever lose it before I completed it, but this is the first complete bound volume.  I think for my next log I'm going to do one workout per side of a sheet

* There was a segment on how some people respond to food like an addict to drugs (increase dopamine release etc.) Of course I agree with this 100%, just say ""oh well, this affliction will kill me so thats that""?

* This documentary does a really awful job of portraying surgery wait times in Canada. Our doctors are busy treating people who have no option other than surgery. You're on a 5 year wait list? Why not use that time to try and take any miniscule step to better your life? I don't want to start any BS about our healthcare system vs. any other

* Obese people watching this now have justification for their lifestyle since 16:9 didn't cover a single alternative method for obese people to approach improving their quality of life other than surgery. I completely agree obesity and food addiction is a disease but unlike cancer, obesity can be treated through a lot of fucking hard work and a little bit of motivation.

I just wanted to wrap with I am in *no way* prejudice against the overweight. If you're obese and in this subreddit reading my rant, then lashing out at the world for not providing you with a free fix fast enough is not something I'm okay with.

That giant shirt is my husband's shirt. For quite some time, until I am just simply obese. How awesome is that? I cannot wait to proclaim my simple obesity to strangers on the street! I know a lot of extremely obese folks do not believe that they can do it, but this is a lie. How is it possible?

No more sodas, and you will not want to eat it. Same goes for candy, energy drinks, and anything salty. Most people will go by fat grams and carbs on food, but I learned early that if it's got a lot of salt in it, it probably has a shitton of fat and sugars and I shouldn't eat it. Aim for salty items that have &lt;5% of your daily salt intake. That's twenty delicious items to eat a day!

Buy real food. Packaged junk is probably what got you into this problem in the first place. Frozen vegetables are just as good as the real kind, about spoiling. We eat out twice a month, it is a special treat. The rest of the month I bond to my stove, making many varieties of stir fries with chicken meat. Yum! Learn to cook! I suggest [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Cook-Everything-Completely-Revised-Anniversary/dp/0764578650) There's 2000 recipes in there, and hell there's something that's bound to tickle your deliciousness gland.

Exercise. It's your friend. I started out in the midst of winter, lift your jugs above your head and dream of the sweet freedom that lies just beyond that door. When you do go outside, don't let the snarky stares of people force you back indoors. You are stuck with you, not them. It's your body and YOU have to live in it, so do what you need to do! I work out at least an hour a day now, and I can outrun my twig friends. It is glorious.

Keep tabs on your progress. I take pictures and measure myself

I do not know what else to say. I was just super happy and wanted to share the news :)

Starting out on the left would have been around 4 years ago. I've lifted with countless friends and watched them get great gains in short periods of time and has definitely made my journey bitter sweet.

Left picture weight was around 120 pounds at 6 feet (track/cross country).
Right is 6 feet 170 pounds.

**My biggest mistakes I wish I could tell every hard gainer/small bone structured individuals:**

- Diet is key (eat a ton of calories with lots of protein

- Keep increasing weights. My biggest problem was I always attempted to hit a certain rep count on a certain weight. This caused constant plateaus. I.e. I would attempt to bench 150 pounds for 10 reps before moving up weight. * I quickly learned my fastest gains have come when I constantly go heavy and keep moving up the weights.*

- Log your workouts!

1313326634.0,jifh6,I broke one of the gym floor rules today and it felt awesome,daulex,710,331,152,"8am

I finished benching my 5x5 and felt brave, he was wearing a rock climbing t-shirt, his forearms were massive and he looked pretty damn strong, but the guy was considerably smaller than me so I decided not to say anything, until I saw him benching.

Half height, was following the bar with his eyes, so it was wobbling all over the place. So I waited for him to finish and at the risk of sounding like a twat, said: to be frank mate, you're not even benching this [referring to his current weight], he paused for a second and asked if I could explain myself. I asked him to do another set and then watched him do all of these things again.

I said ""you should go lower"". He said that he can't and to go lower, with these pointers in mind. He barely finished it (failed on the last one) and said, damn that's hard.

We started talking and he said that he's been in this gym for 3 years and he works out a lot

I generally keep my head down and my lifts up and rarely talk to anyone. The fact that in 3 years, infuriated me beyond belief. The programme that he was put on by the personal trainers included bench press, but the instructor never bothered to correct his technique or to point out that ""half bench isn't optimal for strength increasing"".

I asked what his aim was and he said ""general strength increase"".

I told him about sl5x5

My point is: there are people, see if they are willing to accept help and maybe point them in the right direction, it will feel good.

I look forward to seeing his strength levels shoot past mine.",,t5_2qhx4,True,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jifh6/i_broke_one_of_the_gym_floor_rules_today_and_it/

It started with an extreme lightweight diet for my high school rowing program in the summer and then when school started and conditioning as well I just kept pushing myself.

1345806485.0,yqybc,1 year and 1 month progress (with pics)  183 pounds to 138 pounds,notsopro,510,135,166,"Pics are at the bottom (day 1 to present day) 

So I finished University last year and weighed in at 13st 1lp (83.1kg or 183.4 pounds) I am only 5""7 (170.2 cm) so this is a rather large amount. This is all due to lazyness with cooking and no exercise. As a qualified Physiotherapist I decided it was time to sort myself out. First thing I feel is relevant is that I never considered myself ""fat"". I just thought I was a bit muscular and had a bit of weight on me. looking back now I realise this was wrong. 

Diet: Monday to Friday 

This (for me) is the key. I had exercised before but never did the ""dieting"". I cut out all sugary drinks and consumed far too much diet coke (not ideal but its what I did). I calorie counted and stuck to a deficit of 500-800 calories a day. I ate allot of meat (mainly chicken and beef jerky). 

changed my breakfast from having sugary cereal and maybe two bowls to having three weatabix and a banana (still do this every morning). 

Lunch was usually one sandwhich (where it use to be two) a piece of fruit and an energy bar. 

Dinner was always a decent meal and I usualy had some sort of desert. 

Weekends:

This was vital for me (I emphasise for ME). I had weekends off. no diet and ate what I wanted (within reasonable limits).

Tip- no eating late at night really helped me get out of that habit of needing to be stuffed to sleep. 

Exercise:
for the first six months I just did cardio. 30 minutes 5x a week. Usually a 15 minute cross trainer and 15 minute uphill fast walk on the treatmill (sometimes some rowing was thrown in).

after 6 months I started my mini bulk and cuts- 2 week stint of weights followed by two weeks of cardio. It was this that meant I went from just being slim to having some muscle to show. Weights would consist of:

day 1: Arms and chest

day 2: Back and Abs

day 3: legs

i did 4-5 sessions a week. making sure I never exercised aching muscles. During the bulk phases I changed my diet. no calorie deficit (in fact increased) and high amounts of meat. 

i now weight 138 pounds. 

This worked for me. I never felt i was missing out on nice food and now really enjoy exercising. I still have weekends off and my diet is less restricted. I still eat far to much fizzy drinks (but everyone has their vices). My next goals are to keep going on the bulk and cut to gain a decent amount of muscle but i aim to stay lean rather than bulky.

1287415048.0,dstv1,Ten foods you should be eating,zahrada,487,104,301,"Here's my list of things that should be in your kitchen - especially if you're attempting to lose some body fat and/or be as healthy as humanly possible. I have absolutely no qualifications - just an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Please - post your own if you have them. Of course, but here's some more variety:  


**Berries**. All of them – even if you’re doing keto. They’re super low calorie, flavonoids up the wazoo, and are nutrient-dense to the brim. They’re both nature’s dessert and nutrient delivery system.  Ten strawberries (120 grams) have 38 calories, 7 grams of net carbohydrates, and well over 100% of your vitamin C for the day. 



**Fish oil**. Omega-3s: the source of a bajillion health benefits. Everyone should be supplementing with this on a daily basis. Also great for fat loss in controlled studies. (Thorsdottir I, Gisladottir E, Kiely M, Parra MD, et al. Randomized trial of weight-loss-diets for young adults varying in fish and fish oil content. Int J Obes 2007.) As a general guideline: liquid is better than pills; fish oil should not have a fishy taste.



**Wild Salmon**. Almost a second-parter to the previous entry: wild salmon is getting a healthy omega-3 intake in taste and style (you'll find a much higher omega-3 content in wild fish, and thyme, finished with a squeeze of lemon. You won’t be hungry after a salmon steak and a side of leafy greens. 



**Whey Protein**. Besides the obvious convenience of having a complete, tissue repair, etc.), replacing carbohydrate/fat calories with pure protein will have you coming to your next meal less hungry (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17964616), provide a thermic effect (which translates to less calories), preserve muscle mass when cutting (with a proper exercise program, it'll lead to an improved body composition/support current basal metabolic rate), they can be pretty damn tasty if blended with some ice and milk/water (my French vanilla protein tastes like ice cream when blended). I treat whey like a daily dessert. Note: many manufacturers use artificial sweeteners in their whey protein shakes so do your research on possible health issues.



**Coffee/Yerba Mate/Green Tea/Black Tea/Oolong Tea**. All of these drinks are zero calories on their own. Caffeine aids in fat loss as a thermogenic (even better when added with ephedrine – but make sure that you dose correctly if you take this route - I can provide links if necessary) and an ergogenic (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/481158). Drinking a morning java suppresses my hunger until lunchtime. Yerbe mate has about the same amount of caffeine as an espresso, but your body will quickly adjust to this. Green teas have less caffeine, but they also have special polyphenols/catechins (epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate) which boost norepinephrine production, aiding in prolonging thermogenesis. EGCG supplements may help if you want this effect without drinking lots of tea – however


**Extra Virgin Coconut oil**. Coconut oils are satiating, so they’re digested very quickly and are used very similarly to carbohydrates. Although it can be expensive (a small tub runs me about $30), coconut oil is a necessary saturated fat to have in your diet. [A randomized double-blind clinical trial with 40 women exhibiting obesity found that supplementation with coconut oil promoted a reduction in obesity without causing dyslipidemia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19437058). Add it to stir fry, fried eggs, desserts, and/or anything/everything. Damn thing is magic - especially if you're a fan of the coconut flavour. 



**Kale**. Go to your grocery store. Go to the fresh produce section. Step away from the lettuce (if you do anything, steam it, and/or generally cook the hell out of it. Use it as filler with a piece of meat and some healthy fats (nuts, animal fat, olive/almond/macadamia nut/sesame oils) to stay satisfied longer. Kale is a flavonoid, vitamin, and an isothiocyanate (anti-cancer) delivery system. It’s the complete micro-supplement.



**Omega-3 eggs**. The whole damn egg. None of this “whites only” bullcrap. The omega-3 eggs have documented omega-3 fat content that’s mutiple times higher than the alternative (three-six times the amount in most cases) by having the hens eat a diet that’s more flax-rich. However, lunch, and dinner). 85 calories, 6 grams of fat, 6 grams of protein, incredible nutrient density, a million ways to make them, they’ll keep you full for a lot longer than a bowl of cereal



**Almond butter**. Usually considered a bulking food, buy anything that *isn’t* an oily mess when you open it (solid means hydrogenated oils – one of the most terrible things you can put in your body). There should be a layer of greasy goodness. Pro-tip: store it upside down for a couple days and mix it well. Don’t be pouring that goodness down the drain. There should be (at most) two ingredients: the almond and maybe salt. If you’re one of those people that finds it difficult to control intake of peanut butter, almond might suit you a lot better. Try putting a spoon in the middle of cottage cheese or yogurt to add some texture. Almonds, of course, have excellent health benefits and micronutrient profiles.



**Your favourite food**. Sure, whether it be cinnamon buns, Lindor chocolates, or a massive rack of sauced-up back ribs. In the long run, as long as it’s not an everyday type of thing and you keep your intake within reasonable amounts, it won’t make a measurable difference. Have a meal every week or two where you indulge in your favourite food(s) as part of your diet. It’ll keep you sane, prevent binges (once you add your favourite foods to your scheduled diet, and (most importantly) keep your favourites just a stone’s throw away. Eventually

* The people who walk backwards on the treadmills.
* The almost psychotic levels of selfishness amongst the gym goers. (This is a general problem in China
* The staff member who walks around karate kicking the machines thinking he's impressing women. (It seems to work).
* The staff smoking in the gym...
* The crazy bitch in tiny hotpants who does all her open-legged yoga stretching in the middle of the free weights section. (There are 3 or 4 empty yoga rooms).
* The older dudes (hard to tell
* All the skinny Chinese dudes walking around wearing gloves thinking they are alpha. (They are about the size of a 13 year old white boy).
* NO ONE changing the weight setting in the machines. They just sit down and start pumping.
* The people with the cling film wrapped around parts of their bodies...
* The selfish pricks who bring radios with them at full blast listening to talk radio.
* Most people wearing jeans and shoes.
* And in general, etc. Most people are probably injuring themselves.

As a no-longer skinny guy who's put on exceptional amounts of what feels like almost pure muscle since I began hitting the gym, I'm almost truly satisfied with my physique, and as a result I feel I have some sort of credibility.

**Now

Marijuana helped me overcome a few things

* I never want to stop eating, and **consuming these huge amounts of man food never seemed so easy.**

* **I can control my sleep, but either way it feels good being able to sleep an appropriate amount of hours, and I really do think my recovery has improved.

* I no longer associate soreness with discomfort. In fact, I have now come to enjoy the soreness, as marijuana makes stretching those sore muscles feel so good its like orgasm. Ultimately, **it makes me want to become sore again, helping me with progressive overload.**

What I'm getting at here, to believe, but it's the truth. I don't want to start some huge controversy over the legitimacy of marijuana as a supplement, I just want to share how it helped me with a change of lifestyle that was more physically promotional.

I hope there's an audience out there with similar goals that can draw something positive from this. Please, but I've found something that really does work for me.

############**EDIT:#######**

Wow, and provided counterpoints. I just want to state to all those people who have taken an interest that marijuana **IS NOT A SHORTCUT**.

**TL;DR album http://imgur.com/a/fWFjf#AuevJJW

**Stats:** 

* Height: 5'11"" 
* Weight: 174 lbs
* Age: 21
* Body Fat: Not sure
* Bench: 265 lbs Squat: 275 lbs Dead: 315 lbs OHP: 155 lbs

**Routine:** 

* I lift six times a week using a three day split. 
* Beginning of the week is heavy
* Sun--Chest/Tri, Wed--Chest/Tri, Thurs--Back/Bi, Fri--Legs/Shoulder

**Sunday--&gt;** 

* Bench 1x5
* Narrow Grip Work 
* Incline Barbell 
* Dumbbell Flies 

**Monday--&gt;** 

* Deadlift 1x5
* Weighted Pull Ups
* Some Variation of Rows 
* Preacher Curls 

**Tuesday--&gt;** 

* Squat 1x5
* OHP 1x5
* Lunges 
* Shrugs
* Straight-legged Deadlift
* Shoulder Raises 

* Wednesday, depending on how I'm feeling at the gym. 

Here's an example of one of my high rep days: 

**Wednesday--&gt;** 

* Bench 3x12 w/ ~60% of my 1RM
* Incline Dumbbells--I go pretty light on these to where I can do 3x15. Dumbbells are great for giving your chest a good aesthetic look
* Dumbbell Flies--Light enough to do 3x20 
* Accessory tricep work--These exercises vary from workout to workout
* These hypertrophy days are all about getting a good pump and really feeling a good burn. Although they're light weights

**Other Stuff:**

* I will do some core work about twice a week but I get most of it through squats and deadlifts. 

* I don't really follow a program right now

**Diet:**

* Chicken breasts are the staple of my diet. I usually eat two whole chicken breasts with some quinoa and some vegetables for lunch and dinner. 
* Four eggs for breakfast
* Two scoops of ON Gold Standard after workout. 
* I drink a shit ton of milk. Probably two gallons of whole milk a week. 
* Snack throughout the day on fruit and almonds. 
* Canned tuna 
* GREEK YOGURT
* I try to keep my alcohol intake down
* Supplements: Creatine Isolate, Beta-Alinine, Arginine. 

**My Story:**

I've always been active and I love playing all kinds of sports. I played baseball and hockey throughout high school but I was never very familiar with the gym. 

Once I got to college, I broke my collarbone (hence the scar across my shoulder) and then tore my ACL the next semester. I was pretty fucked. Once I got healthy, I committed to working in the gym and missing as few workouts as I could. 

This is my progress! By no means am I satisfied

My gym is a fairly standard fare, we get a free ""personal training"" session when we sign up and every eight weeks. My first session wasn't very helpful, mostly taking measurements, planning out a machine-only routine that I made clear wasn't what I wanted to do, and going over a few of the machines. When it came to my second session a few days ago, I'd hoped we could move past that and actually correct my lifting form, but unfortunately it was more of the same.

This time, but while I was doing my squats I had a trainer come up to me and confront me about this. I explained that I had my own plan, and asked him if he could correct my squat form quickly. Annoyed, he observed me for a few squats before saying that I was doing it wrong (without specifying where I was going wrong) and that I should stick with their plan for a few months. I was hoping that I could just leave it at that, review my form as much as possible and hopefully correct whatever I was doing wrong, but just yesterday I had the guy at the counter tell me to stick with their plan.

I want to learn how to lift properly, and it's hard to train with the trainers looking over my shoulder. What should I do about this?

**Waist before:** ~40 in. (101 cm)

**Wieght after:** 180 lbs (81 kg)
**Waist after:** 32 in. (81 cm)


**Background:**
I grew up competitively swimming from a very young age (~7 years old). I was an athletic kid all through middle school and high school. Unfortunately, my exercise schedule changed drastically (disappeared really) but my diet did not. I was aware of the weight gain, but never really bothered to do anything about it. The changes were so gradual from day to day that I never found the motivation to re-think my eating and exercising habits. After 3 years, I needed a physical from my doctor and found out my cholesterol levels were through the roof as well as slightly elevated liver function tests. Combining my family history of high cholesterol and my current lifestyle, I was on the fast track to major health problems if I kept it up. My doctor said I was just over the borderline of medication, and I left the doctors office with a prescription for cholesterol lowering medication. 

That day every thing changed.

I was determined develop proper eating and exercise habits. Weight loss was my number one goal. Approaching it from a scientific point of view, it was the single hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. What makes it hard is the constant, unending, relentless struggle against hunger and the desire for food as well as the motivation needed to push yourself to work out. It was brutal to say the least.


**Diet:**
The first and most important thing about my diet was limiting caloric intake. Less than 2000 calories a day, and lots of it. The first two weeks were hell, my stomach hadn't finished shrinking yet (yes, it will shrink) and the desire to eat was unbearable. After a while, it got easier to manage. Allowing yourself a cheat day where you don't count calories every couple of weeks will really allow your sanity to remain stable. Eventually it became habit, and the pounds fell off like magic. After I got used to the amount of food, I focused on eating healthier foods. No processed food. No fried foods. No soda. The things you should eat are whole foods, fresh meat, I ate mostly vegetables. They fill you up and have next to nothing when it comes to calories. 


**Exercise:**
I didn't focus on exercising until my weight had significantly dropped (to around 200 pounds). Most of my exercise was cardio. Running, not even being able to move, to doing more than 10 without stopping. It feels great to be in shape. I'm a regular reader of [/r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness) and I  am going to keep up with my exercise and improve as much as I can.

Weight loss is NOT impossible. If I can do it,,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,True

I knew about Joe Weider long before I met him - he was the godfather of fitness who told all of us to ""Be Somebody with a Body."" He taught us that through hard work and training we could all be champions. When I was a young boy in Austria, I felt that he was speaking directly to me and I committed to move to America to make my vision of becoming the best bodybuilder, to live the American dream, and to become an actor a reality.

Joe didn’t just inspire my earliest dreams; he made them come true the day he invited me to move to America to pursue my bodybuilding career. I will never forget his generosity. One of Joe’s greatest qualities is that he wasn’t just generous with his money; he freely gave of his time and expertise and became a father figure for me. He advised me on my training, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in ""Hercules in New York"", even though I barely spoke English. As my career took off, he was always nearby, giving advice, promoting my movies or my crusade as the Chairman of the President's Council on Fitness in the pages of his magazines, and I will miss him dearly.

He leaves behind a fantastic legacy of a fitter world. Very few people can claim to have influenced as many lives as Joe did through his magazines, and his big-hearted personality. Joe was known for urging everyone, “Exceed yourself,” and there is no question that throughout his life, he did just that.

My thoughts and prayers are with his extraordinary wife, and all of his family and friends.""

Not the most impressive transformation

My goals for the summer are visible abs and a clear shot at playing on my university's soccer team.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Edit: Sorry I forgot to give information about my routines, etc... Here's a basic rundown of what I've been doing.

I've been running every day except for when I sprained my ankle and foot on two separate occasions. I do at least four miles and if I'm feeling adventurous I'll do 6 or more.

Starting in about March I began doing the Insanity workout doing only the ""Cardio Abs"" video every day. I know it's not intuitive to the program

Towards the end of March this year I began lifting regularly after my foot got better and I was less intimidated by the gym. I went every day for a few weeks mostly trying to get used to the weights themselves and to test myself as a human being. I do a mixture of dumbells and cable machines while still doing exercises from the ""Cardio Abs"" video with a medicine ball incorporated into each exercise and I've still been running every day.

My favorite physical/athletic accomplishment was running 6 miles in 50 minutes (to take a break to watch the sunrise) at 8

As far as what goes in my body, and put an egg into my top ramen. I never drink HFCS or eat processed sugars and fats (my friend accidentally gave me a soda a few months ago and the carbonated syrup made me feel nauseous.) I've taken a strong liking to V8 juices (the vegetable and fusion ones) even though they're kind of high in sodium. However, I've been drinking a lot of water as well which offsets my high sodium intake a little: about 200 ounces of water per day which I know is kind of unhealthy since I'm only 5'11"" and weigh 190. I think this combined with the regular exercise has prevented me from getting sick at all and I usually get two really bad colds per year.

Another thing I indulge myself in a few times per week (since they can be expensive) are fruit and vegetable smoothies. My favorite right now is strawberry banana spinach almond with a large dollop of fat free yogurt and a few teaspoons of unprocessed sugar. Gives me a lot of energy and is really refreshing with the summer heat.

Unfortunately I don't have gym access right now during the summer quarter so I've had to do a lot of body resistance exercises which has gotten me very innovative and creative as far as how I do my reps and routines even though it's been a little unsafe at times

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

If you guys have any questions for me feel free to ask them. I'm by no means a fitness expert. In fact I'm quite the opposite since the only thing impressive about my physique are my legs and I can only thank a lifetime of playing soccer and tennis for that. But I'm just trying to live healthier and having stronger lungs has REAAAALLY improved my skills as a musician. In fact that was the main reason I started exercising more

**Routine:**
I did [THIS](http://newbie-fitness.blogspot.com/2006/12/rippetoes-starting-strength.html) version of SS that I got from the old /fit/ sticky. I'm really enjoying it so far and I have noticed signifigant gains in strength and aesthetics.

**Diet:** Since im in college and have a meal plan almost all my food comes from dining halls. I try to get the healthy stuff but its sometimes not avaliable. I never eat super greasy food though like chips and pizza. I count calories and I aim for around 3200-3400 a day with about 160-180 grams of protein. 

**Supplements:** I use ON whey protein and take about 2 scoops a day


Im going to stay on SS until i stop seeing steady gains but it seems like i still have a few months left on this program. If you have any questions on what I did feel free to ask!

His response was

I laughed. And explained that I only did multiple sets on machines because people had been jumping in front of me all night. And that I'm too nice of a guy to say something

He still asked me to leave. And I refused. I said I had two stations left and I know I may not be doing these the way other people are

He asked me to leave. 

And thankfully before I even decided to get up off my machine to really yell at him. A guy that was running on a machine behind me the entire night had decided to vouch for me. And the employee left. 

I thanked the guy and we went off on our merry way.

Through this community, bought a pair of vibrams and gotten into barefoot running, and the results are undeniable: people don't just ask me whether I've lost weight or am working out, they compliment me on shirts I've owned for years and ask whether I just got back from vacation.

All weights in kg.

Details below and personal context at the very bottom:

* Age: 22
* Height: 6ft2
* Weight: 82.1 --&gt; 84.1

Lifts all to 5 reps. I have not tested 1RMs. Progressions be seen visualised in the top album.

* Bench: 40 --&gt; 62
* OHP: 30 --&gt; 45
* Deadlift: 70 --&gt; 120

See paragraph 7 of personal for explanation of different starts on chart and initial drops in weight lifted.

[The program I'm using is practical programming from here.](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/The_Starting_Strength_Novice/Beginner_Programs#Practical_Programming_Novice_Program:)

**Diet:**

* **Breakfast:** 5:30AM 2 eggs scrambled or boiled and a coffee or tea (some veg if there's any going spare)
* **Lunch:** 9:00AM-13:00PM (variable depending on schedule.) Essentially silverhydra's Meat Slop
* **Dinner:** about 200g of chicken, sometimes lambs/chicken liver or cow/pig heart if we can get it. This is with rice, pasta or potatoes and as many assorted veggies as will fit in as well. Usually onions, peppers, mushrooms, leek, kale, carrots

**Supplements:**

I've not been supplementing until the last week or so. Now I'm taking:

* Fish oil
* Vitamin D
* Creatine 5g (since 7 days ago.)

I felt better in general since working out but these have made a real impact. In all honesty I think most comes from the vitamin D (live in UK and work in windowless office most days) and the better hydration to account for the creatine. Since starting these supplements my thoughts have been clearer and my work more efficient. I've had 3 large projects to finish this week just gone. I set target finish times for each day (doing a specific project a day) and was finished between 2-4 hours earlier than I aimed for on all. Usually I over-run by about 1-2 hours.

**Additional:**

Usually I would sleep about 5 hours a night. I cut back Reddit time to get to sleep earlier and now get between 7-9 hours depending on work/timetabling. 

I had no target for weight loss or gain and limited funds so I couldn't buy substantial amounts of additional food. I was bang in the middle of a healthy BMI range so took the approach that; if I started losing weight I'd need to either stop or find a way to eat more and that it didn't matter if I put on weight because I could just lose it later. 

With this in mind; if I was offered food at work (buffets etc) I would take it and eat as much as I could stomach focusing on meats. As it turns out my weight hasn't changed much.

*I wrote this working downwards in expectation of how much I thought people would care so below is my personal reasoning for doing this. Read no further if you don't care about gross feelings an emotions and shit.*


--------

**Personal:**

During my second year of Uni I was a failing student. I'd gotten worse since the first year and it wasn't looking up. I wanted to do research so I spent the summer learning a bunch of skills to fix my grades in the final year. I went from a 3rd in the second year to a 1st in the final year narrowly missing a 1st overall average for the degree. 

The side effect of this was I literally internalised myself for over a year. I worked hard and got results but I basically stopped everything but mental exertion. I was previously pretty active having done Parkour and gymnastics regularly. 4 years ago I used to be able to do 15 chins fairly easy and I've only recently just broken back into double figures.

The grades got me on an MSc and I spent the year telling myself if I could just afford a kettlebell I could workout. I never did. I'm now on a paid 4 year MSc(1yr) PhD(3yr) and managed to reapply the approaches I took to my grades to my working out. In preparation for starting the course and being at the Uni I started doing bodyweight workouts. Not with any particular goal other than habit formation. I figured if I could get back into a routine of working out I'd be ok going back in. 

Once I started Uni I stopped working out.

A couple of months in I started to get into it again and realised I'd not bothered to adapt the routine to my new schedule at all. I tried to find some friends who ""worked out"" and get a regular session going ASAP. I picked SS practical programming as a routine on the premise that early on

Almost straight away my friends weren't interested as I wanted to do ""He-Man lifts"" i.e. not bench or curl. So I started going on my own

I made huge mistakes early on. You can see my lifts drop dramatically on bench and squat after the first few sessions. This was because

Since then I've just kept focused and taken a policy of checking my behaviours once a week for improvement but otherwise refusing unsolicited advice. I did not believe the whole ""curlbro"" mentality fit jokes about was a real thing till I started working out. Multiple times I've been referred to as ""the squatter"" and told I'm going ""awefully low on those squats"". 

I feel much better already. I feel even better since supplementing which I hadn't thought possible and I feel **even** better in myself. My self-esteem is growing as is my confidence and I've already caught myself behaving in ways I would never have previously. I can't wait to keep going with this.

Finally; short term target is to get to a bodyweight bench press and I anticipate staying on this routine until at least then. At that point I will re-evaluate my goals.

---------

EDIT: To those of you asking about the skills I developed for learning that helped me get from a 3rd to a 1st: I'm ever so slowly building a resource for a website on these techniques as they are little beyond the scope of a short post. I'll be sure to message people if it ever gets to a presentable quality. I'm also doing a 2 hour video presentation on speed reading (including a bit about the actual physiology of the eye and why most ""speed reading"" is bullshit).

Additionally

&gt;I don't know what is more embarassing, you squat less than my anorexic 14 year old niece. Second of all if she or any one else that wasn't a functionally retarded infant did SS, they would gain 35 pounds on their squat in a week, not 2 months. Rippetoe/any one who actually knows anything about strength training/fitness would throw up in their mouth if they saw that. Also, to not only post your shitty nonexistant progress but your life story is probably the most cringe worthy thing on the internet. Luckily you posted it to reddit. Don't feel special you autistic DYEL faggot. Maybe next time do something remotely impressive before you waste your time writing a post about it.

**Background**

I have always been fairly active (martial arts and fucking around at the gym), and I broke my ankle in a bike accident.  My diet and training went to shit due to the lack of time and stress.  I gained over 20 pounds of flab due to frequent ice cream and other crap without working out consistently.  I still had a decent frame underneath, but it was covered with too much flab for me to be happy with it.

Soon after seeing that image (with the sexy pink goggles), but rather in a ""I must constantly improve"" kind of way.  I find that with people who don't ""get it"", any kind of acknowledgement that there is room to improve, or that you don't like something about yourself makes them think you are depressed or emo.  For me it wasn't about that, it was about setting a goal and working towards it; emotions barely entered the picture.

For reference

*Lifts at start*

Bench: 185 x 1

OH press: Unknown

Squat: 225 x 3

Deadlift: 315 x 1



**Phase 1: 2010-08 to 2012-04**

In September 2010 I got back into my main training program for the last 2 years - Crossfit.  I know that program gets a considerable amount of hate on reddit, so the program was more like bench/OH press/squat/deadlift with HIIT.  That said, it wasn't as organized well and I wasted a lot of time working on form for Olympics lifts that I now realize I don't really care that much about (other than power clean).

During this period I didn't really get the results I wanted

About 3 months before the image was taken I switched to 5/3/1.  This caused the biggest increase in my strength

*Lifts at end*

Bench: 215 x 1

OH press: 135 x 1

Squat: 295 x 1

Deadlift: 315 x 8


**Phase 2012-04 to 2012-08**

After the April 2012 shot I decided I wanted to be a little more aggressive with cutting

I lost the weight a lot faster here than I had intended, and I got hand, foot, and mouth disease towards the end which totally killed my appetite for almost a week and a half.

Cutting also sucked because I got sick more often.  I stuck to ""slow carb"" principles which I think made this phase easier

*Lifts at end*

Bench: 205 x 1

OH press: 125 x 1

Squat: 295 x 1

Deadlift: 315 x 6


**Phase 3; 2012-08 to present**

After the August 2012 shot I switched to bulking on Greyskull LP.  I'm planning to gain very slowly to avoid as much fat entirely

I no longer track calories daily

During this phase and now I do not do hill sprints

My current goals are that within one year:

* Weight 175 at ~12% BF

* Increase my bench/press/squat/deadlift to 200x5/135x5/295x5/325x5 respectively.

*Lifts currently (I no longer go for 1 rep maximums)*

Bench: 175 x 5

OH press: 110 x 5

Squat: 215 x 6

Deadlift: 285 x 7

**Some takeaways**

* Counting calories works

* Structured

* Diet is even more important than you think

* Aim for smooth

* Keeping detailed track of your workouts and appearance is highly motivating

* Program types matter; strength programs build strength, take ownership of that and don't let anyone say that strength is a more noble goal.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,

*breath control: inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth in order to keep the inside of mouth moist. I had always heard this advice and never fully applied it. Today I fell into a kind of trance-like rhythm with my breath cycle. My mouth didn't dry out and I was able to focus on the sensation of air entering my lungs rather than how my legs/knees/feet were feeling (mild pain). 
 
*synchronize upper and lower body: swinging arms and legs in a precise pattern. I felt my right arm reach its apex at the same moment the left leg was fully forward. I shifted my focus slightly

*ab strength: my abs have become much stronger after 6 months of regular gym work. As my legs became tired and my back began to ache as it usually does, in the past, I would have given up because of the burning muscles and mild pain. 

*stillness: I held my hands and face loose for comfort. A few years ago I read that long-distance runners keep still every body part not involved directly in running. The article specifically said their hands hang loose and their face is relaxed. I tried these two suggestions and it felt good. No grimacing or balling my hands into fists. I think this is more of a focus thing for me and not so much an energy conservation tactic that a marathon runner might employ.

Over the last 7 weekdays I have, the following is the average of the last 7 days which I feel is representative of fittit in the past few months:

  **The Data**

- Aesthetic Concerns (Looking better as it pertains to shaping and muscles rather than fat loss): 5

- Possibly Motivational (links or stories which had beneficial feedback and were created to help others): 5

- Community building (links of self posts with the aim of joining people together or creating a sense of camaraderie): 13

- Validate my social life (Conversation and validation of the self that does not fall into the previous two categories): **16**

- Validate my routine (Looking for feedback and validation of a current diet or fitness regimen): 3

- Picture

- Picture

- Asking for recommendations for equipment or routines: 6

- Advice asking that is not covered by the FAQ: 21

- Advice asking that is covered by the FAQ: **13**

Total: 100

   **Personal concerns**

I bolded what concerns me. I personally have no problem with jokes and socializing

This is also a community of 36

   **Representativeness**

To the notion of representation, or validate based on their context. ('Who else is an olympic lifter' were put into community building, 'I love swimming lol' were put into validate). So the next time one talks about how 'fittit is not all about looking good, losing weight, and free weights', the data I gathered says otherwise (aesthetics were specifics, all diet and weight questions were put in advice asking or community/validation).

   **Problems**

There has been a huge rise in the amount of complaints from people about the rise in unnecessary links and posts 'clogging' up the main page. The comments are no better in some cases. What concerns me is that these complaints are coming **from the most interactive

  **Possible solutions**

There are two; either the community as a whole starts making /r/fitness more beneficial to it's members

Personally (I speak out of line here, but the majority of flamewars are started by people who I have not seen before (given how I am on fittit 5 hours each day, I know you...). Regular posters are not given 'protection' in any way, but the benefit of a doubt. This may be the course fittit will take if moderators have to take action. It will be a better community, but people may be excluded. I do not wish for people to be excluded so I am open for other options.

Please Discuss.

   **Tl;dr**

Read it; the future discourse of fittit depends on your ability to hold you attention longer than a canine with ADHD.

**Edit**

It was just brought to my attention that the sponsored links forced upon us by reddit (no problems there) seem to have overridden the stickied FAQ. Will give consideration to fixing that.

**Edit2**

There seems to be some confusion that the goal of /r/fitness is a gathering point for people to talk and that votes are the end all be all. This is not 100% true. Although everything pertains to the vast definition of fitness

Day 6; ""Push"" -Hypertrophy 

Day 7; ""Legs&amp;Abs"" -Hypertrophy

Day 8; REST

I alternate between strength training ideas,3,1) a bit, and its brutal, but I like it.

examples;

A typical (hypertrophy) Pull day;

-Deadlifts 8x10 (4x10 standard/snatch grip)(4x10 sumo)

-Dumbell Rows 8x10

-Good Mornings 8x10

-Bicep curls, Hamstring curls, all 5x10, and supersetted.

A typical (hypertrophy) Push day;

-Bench Press 8x10

-Military Press 8x10

-Incline Bench Press 8x10

-Shoulder Raises, Chest Flies

A typical (strength) Leg&amp;abs day;

-Lowbar Back Squat 6x3 (I use high bars for hypertrophy)

-Front Squat 6x3 (to make up for the reduced ROM from a lowbar)

-Weighted situps 5x5

-Goblet squat, cable crunches 5x5/6x3 in the cases its possible.

On all of the ""Strength"" days I try and get a set of cleans in aswell to ""warm up"".

I cycle 6 miles to the gym

Gym always in the mornings

I sprint train every leg day

As for diet, to sate my sweet tooth, I get veg in a lot of my meals aswell, so if you aim to get your 5 a day in fruit, you will definately get enough micronutrients. I space 3 protein shakes through the day, and make a batch of chillie every week, so I always have a heavy meal available when I get home. I haven't bulked/cut

I know I should count my calories, sports, etc.

Other supplements/foods;
Creatine

The important numbers;

waist is 31"", dick size has remained the same, can't do much about getting that bigger, no matter how much I need to :(

Initial Numbers;

-Deadlift; 220lb/100kg x 4

-(Front) Squat; 110lb/50kg x 5 
(I struggled getting any heavier onto my chest

-Bench Press; 110lb50kg x 5

Current numbers;

-Deadlift; 429lb/195kg (almost hit 2 reps!)

-(Back) Squat; 319lb/145kg (low bar)

-Bench Press; 253lb/115kg

Recent achievement though was dominating 150kg (330lb) for 8x10 in sumo deadlifts

My proudest PR however is my 10.95 100m sprint time.

1345971581.0,yuidj,Finding fitness. One fat dude's 9 month journey. [PICS],Robeauxcop,460,102,127,"Hey

**My story:**

   I've always been 'bigger', wrestling, baseball, and the gym 5 days a week for 4 years straight. I lifted weights, ran a ton, and was just in all around good shape. 
   Fast forward 7 years, lost my job, and became completely sedentary. I looked for work for a long time, even changing cities in order to find something. After awhile though, I think I just gave up on it all. Work, life, happiness. I managed to wrangle another girlfriend after my move, but it didn't end up working out. (I had some issues with trust.) Anyways
   Last December I'd decided enough was enough. I'd entered a new relationship, and Keto, had galvanized me into believing that it was time for a change. I began with just diet (keto mostly, but I still eat fruit once in awhile, although I was really strict at the start.) After I had gotten down to around 220 lbs I was comfortable enough in my own skin to start hitting the gym, so I began going around 3 days a week. Now I'm in the gym 3-5 days a week, and comfortable enough to begin running/jogging out in public to build up cardiovascular endurance. But yeah

**DIET:**

 
  Keto mostly, and have 'carb up' days to replenish glycogen when I feel like I need to. (Hard to explain, but I can tell when I need carbs.)
   I eat a salad every day at lunch
   I fast just about every day for 16-18 hours.

**EXERCISE:**
*3 sets to failure


Mondays and Thursdays: Chest

Tuesdays and Fridays: Back

Wednesdays: Legs

**I'm just now getting comfortable enough with my body to run in public



**TL;DR:**

  Got fat and depressed after high school. Years later


  Anyways


Much love

Robeauxcop

About nearly four years ago, that was my wake up call to get a gym membership and I have continued working out since then. Over the years I went from 230 lbs to about 167 lbs now. I am pretty satisfied with my progress but there is a lot I can improve upon. One thing I really need to concentrate on is a good diet. This is kinda of hard when you and your friends are ents that have really bad munchies. Another thing is my loose skin after since I lost my first 50 lbs in a quick time period. Any exercises and recommendations to tone out that section would be really helpful if anyone has suggestions. I can see my abs begin to develop more and more each day but the saggy skin is just hard to get rid off.

- Fish oil really isn't a panacea for everybody. I would actually minimize the importance of fish oil supplementation for somebody who is completely metabolically healthy. I'm personally going to stop supplementing fish oil as mackeral is already high in my diet

- For those at risk for disease states or currently unhealthy (this is overweight people

- The dose for preventative health is actually quite low (250-1000mg EPA+DHA) and neurology higher (1500mg DHA+

- It doesn't seem to increase insulin sensitivity, so I guess the 'doesn't cause insulin sensitivity' thing is just semantics. For all practical reasons it has the same effects.

I've been reading all these threads about what people want to say to the chubby dude who's lost weight or the fat girl who's working hard and so on. Let me tell you what a trainer at my gym did for me today.

First of all the guy was doing whatever the kind of exercise is where you take the bumper plates and stack them on a barbell--he had like 4 45lb. plates on each side--and from a standing start, then drop it. I don't know what that's called but it looked hardcore. Plus it's super-loud when he drops the rig and it bounces off the plywood base he's standing on.

So he was doing that while I was doing my squats &amp; I didn't realize he was a trainer at the gym--I've seen him around but just thought he was a lifter.

I finished all my lifts and did 25 hard minutes on the elliptical (I do HIIT hard enough that I practically fall off the damn thing by the time I'm done). I was walking back to the machine after grabbing a wipe to wipe it down &amp; I see the guy walking towards me

He catches my eye--I'm breathing HARD--and just gives me a very subtle thumbs-up and a nod. That's all. I nodded back and mouthed ""thanks"" in between gasps for air. And let me tell you: I floated out of that fucking gym.

I was able to break the open world raw squat record with a 431 squat, and in the 148.8lb weight class. Just waiting for the drug-test to come back before they will be updated in the 100% raw powerlifting federation website. 

Here is the video:

Edit: I guess it was too hard to see but nobody noticed the diablo 3 t-shirt for the squat.
