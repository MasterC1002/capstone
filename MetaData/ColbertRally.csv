So I make a living doing online advertising stuff

It's incredibly easy, TV channels, geo targeting etc. Even specific shows including Daily Show, Colbert Report or Glenn Beck depending on what direction we go.

The cost is about $1.50 to $4 CPM (Per thousand views) - If we raised $2000 here from all of us we could have our commercial viewed 1 Million times (@$2CPM)

What we'd need to do here is come up with the actual 30 second spot. I'm sure there's some great video-making talent in our midst on this thread

Collectively, and then collectively pool some money - We could get this on the air within a couple days.

What are your thoughts?

After hearing this (and recovering from my shock)


Every college newspaper I've heard of takes students submissions. It seems like a no brainier that each person can write in and get even more attention for the rallies (and [Donors Choose](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361) if you can). Even alumni can write to their Alma mater, actually writing down what you think these rallies will mean could also help you THINK and REASON for yourself their importance and purpose.

Of course what I wrote is only my opinion (and probably too serious and grandiose), moving, or whatever you want. Since they are student publications, college papers usually have a very generous word limit compared to more established papers.

(*Emphasis mine

Thanks for joining us, because quite frankly, after watching the news all weekend, all I want to do is visit with an old friend, and perhaps trade insults about one another's acting ability.

You know, it is a feeling that this country's experienced all too often, and unfortunately for our show, the closer that we have gotten towards discussing and dealing with current events, the harder it becomes in situations where reality is truly sad.

I can give you a typical compilation of the day's news excesses, pretending to be in Washington.
...
So here we are again

How do you make sense of these types of senseless situations?, but **it's definitely true that others are working feverishly to find the tidbit or two that will exonerate their side from blame or implicate the other. And watching that is as predictable, I think, as it is dispiriting.**

Did the toxic political environment cause this? A graphic image here, those types of things? I have no fucking idea. **You know, we live in a complex ecosystem of influences and motivations, and I wouldn't blame our political rhetoric any more than I would blame heavy metal music for Columbine. And by the way, that is coming from somebody who truly hates our political environment.** It is toxic, it is unproductive, but to say that that is what has caused this, I just don't think you can do it.

Boy, because then we could convince ourselves that if we just stop this, the horrors will end.** You know, to have the feeling, however fleeting, that this type of event can be prevented forever. But it's hard not to feel like it can't. You know, you cannot outsmart crazy. You don't know what a troubled mind will get caught on. **Crazy always seems to find a way. It always has. Which is not to suggest that resistance is futile.** It sounded pretty dark what I just said there

I don't think that's true, if for no other reason than to draw a better distinction** between the manifestos of paranoid madmen, and what passes for acceptable political and pundit-speak. 

You know

**Let's at least make troubled individuals easier to spot.**
----
And again, and it causes me such sadness, but again, I refuse to give in to that feeling of despair. There is light in this situation. I urge everyone, read up about those who were hurt and/or killed in this shooting. **You will be comforted by just how much anonymous goodness there really is in the world.** You read about these people, and you realize that all the **people that you don't even know, that you have never met,** and you hear about crazy

And I think you'll find yourself even more impressed with Congresswoman Giffords, when the reality of that rhetoric, **when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified.** And please, let us hope we never do. **Let us hope we never become numb to what real horror, what the real blood of patriots looks like when it's spilled.**

**Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often.** Because the reality of dangerous rhetoric is,** I think all of them tonight would absolutely recoil and say, wow, that is not the picture of what we were discussing and what we were talking about, and I **have to remember that there's a reality to that situation that we can't approach verbally.**

Because someone or something will shatter our world again. And wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't take this opportunity, wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't take that moment to make sure that the world that we are creating now, that will ultimately be shattered again by a moment of lunacy, **wouldn't it be a shame if that world wasn't better than the one we'd previously lost?**

So, he and I will most likely insult each other playfully. And then tomorrow, you know, we go back to trying to do what we normally do, which is highlight absurdity in a comical way that is a catharsis for people, and not a sadness. So thank you for listening. I know this is probably more helpful for me than it is for you. But we'll be right back.",,self,,

There will be drink specials for people wearing anything Reddit related (official or not). We will also be introducing some of you to the new drink sensation known as *The Orangered*.

When this idea got started,600 redditors RSVP'd and counting. So here'd the deal:

Show up to One Lounge any time after 3PM this Saturday. There will be a list on their door with the names and locations of other nearby bars. Once One Lounge is full to capacity

Look for a table with nametags: the big ones are for your name and the smaller ones are to write your favorite subreddits on. Then you can find your fellow sub-redditors in the crowd!

And here it is in bullet form because it's just easier to read:

* **What:** Come hang out with Redditors in DC
* **Where:** Starting at One Lounge (1606 20th Street NW) and branching out to nearby establishments
* **When:** Starting at 3PM and going officially until 9
* **Who:** Redditors and their guests (18 years old and up are welcome)

i dont think i have to explain what these past 2 years have felt like for me

**but it wasnt.**

it was real.  everyone i saw there today actually exist.  that man holding the sign saying ""defeat foreign terrorists/support local mosques"" is a sane american, and 
i am floored by how warm the comments are.  i mean, but it sucks it many ways, especially when you really care about what is going on in it.  today, i feel like i am 1 step closer to bridging that gap between me and the people in this country, and *nothing* could have done that for me except for the rally to restore sanity and/or fear.  i feel blessed to have been able to attend it, and loved all the reddit reminders i saw throughout the day.  thank you EVERYONE who participated, all over the world! my insignificant speck of humanity appreciates your patience and understanding

1310766416.0,iqsq9,Colbert Super PAC Update,cinsere,89,13,15,"Greetings Colbert Super PAC Members

You are receiving this first regular update because you are one of the heroes with the balls to become a member of Colbert Super Pac. These are exciting times. Colbert Super PAC has been hailed in the national press as everything from ""legal"" to ""dangerous."" Your voice is being heard and I want to continue to hear from you! 

So here's the latest on what Colbert Super Pac is up to. Soon we'll release our first TV commercial

And let's face it: those messages are long overdue. America has forgotten who it is, America has help from a sexy love interest: Me. I should also mention that this show is on HBO, so you know there's gonna be boobs. 

But we have to act now, and I think we both know I'm talking about the kind of support that is green and worth money, because it is money, or an emerald. Both are acceptable. 

So I urge you to drop everything and head to [www.ColbertSuperPAC.com](http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/). Then pick up the credit card you dropped when I told you to drop everything. 

[Donate now. Donate often. Make a difference. Make a donate.](https://colbertsuperpac.edonation.com/donation1/?initiativekey=REDDIT)

The following things need to start happening to make the message clean and clear **while being completely *non-violent* **.

* Formation of a Tent City outside the Capital - **Tea Tattered Tent Towns** - we need people with a face out there saying they made these cities. The tea party is responsible for this. 
* Not blocking doors but being there
* We need no aggression just people in locked arms taking a play out of the tree huger movement playbook sitting in front of senate offices and lobbyist organizations like The American Chamber of Commerce, Citizens United, and the like.

I just sent this to them using their customer assistance link. I toned it down compared to what I was originally going to write. For instance


&gt; I'm writing to express my severe dissatisfaction with Greyhound's level of service on October 30th

&gt;

&gt; Two days prior, DC (reference number [omitted]). I was attending the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear"", a 12:00pm to 3:00pm event that drew over two hundred thousand people to the capital. My bus was scheduled to depart at 6:30am and arrive 10:50am.

&gt;

&gt; As any reasonable person would expect

&gt;

&gt; Yet I foolishly believed that I had a ride in. I thought that I had purchased a ticket that would get me to DC with time to spare

&gt;

&gt; When I arrived, only to find that they were all one and the same.

&gt;

&gt; Then I waited. For over two hours.

&gt;

&gt; I knew there was no chance of arriving on time. As the line slowly snaked along the terminal walls

&gt;

&gt; The lack of organization demonstrated by Greyhound was profound. Employees were not made aware of the impending rush beforehand

&gt;

&gt; I eventually boarded around 8:40. We hit severe traffic on the Beltway

&gt;

&gt; None of this is intended to denigrate my driver (who was extremely appologetic), I expect a *good faith effort* that the company will attempt to satisfy the demand. I mistakingly believed that Greyhound was not sold out because they had the available capacity. It turns out that they were simply the only ones with the gall to so blatently deceive their customers.

&gt;

&gt; If I had any idea that this was the service I could expect for a basic ticket, a company willing to charge me for the privilege of waiting on line hardly deserves my business, even when they can deliver.

&gt;

&gt; Worst of all, or from taking an even earlier bus.

&gt;

&gt; I will not be riding Greyhound again. I will advise my friends against riding Greyhound. I'll probably post this online for others to see. I don't think a refund will change any of that -- $15 (for one-way) is hardly worth the effort

&gt;

&gt; [Name omitted]

&gt;

&gt; P.S. Is it really that difficult or expensive to put a sink in a bus bathroom? Honest question.

**Edit: I received the following reply on November 25th.**

&gt; Reference: 1683311

&gt; Dear Mr. [Name omitted]

&gt; Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the inconvenience you experienced while using our services.  We are never satisfied when a customer expresses a complaint or displeasure over the way he or she is treated or served

&gt; At Greyhound Lines

&gt; Greyhound does not have a reservation system, we add extra buses and drivers to a schedule when they are needed and if they are available.  Unfortunately, we are unable to determine the exact number of passengers on each schedule, and as a result, overloads do sometimes occur.

&gt; We hope you will not let this incident deter you from using our services

Is it possible for Reddit to set up a donation fund and do a fund-drive so we can generate money to help people who want to come, or they already live in the area and will have minimal travel expenses. I for one would have no problem with donating money to a trustworthy fund if I knew it was going to help people get here and make the rally a huge success. 

I just googled renting charter buses, there are folks here with experience doing this kind of thing who would be anxious to help with this aspect.  

I’m just concerned because I’m looking at a lot of comments on Reddit and the Facebook pages for these rallies where people are saying they’d love to come but can’t afford it. As we all know, into organizing a rally because they were convinced we were serious about this. If we can manage to raise over $200,000 simply to get their attention (and also to support a good cause), I see no reason why we couldn’t raise at least that much again to help our fellow Redditors get to the rally so we can support its message, and also support Stewart and Colbert—also a good cause. And to all those who are worried this is just a joke rally without a message, while that may be how Colbert ramps up interest on his end, I think Stewart has made it clear he wants to send a serious signal with this. 

This is our time to really stand up and make this happen



EDIT: The idea was brought up below that even if Reddit ends up not doing a donation fund, the day-rate for a 50-seat charter bus is around $1200, which works out to around $25 per person--much more manageable for folks. Although I would love to see a Reddit-wide donation fund happen, I think this is a great idea. One advantage is you can have ""point-people"" from certain cities already start figuring out how many people are interested/willing to commit, and begin organizing buses from that city now. A method to ascertain how committed people actually are would need to be developed; you couldn't have a point-person rent a 55-seat bus because they got 55 people saying they were interested, and then early Saturday morning only 20 people show up (driving up the cost for everyone unexpectedly). But I'm sure you all will come up with a solution! And if/when the donation fund does take place, it would just be icing on the cake for everyone!

I will be the first to say I wish it was free. After all


This is how it happened. I originally thought we could simply put the word out to gather at the Westwood Federal Building and that would be it. My friends and I had been discussing how much we wanted to attend the DC event


Hundreds of people started joining the FB page via word of mouth. In less than two weeks, as support for the rally grew and as people became excited about the event, it became evident we would need to get a permit for a public gathering. I’ve organized a lot of events before, but never a rally. I soon discovered that the Federal Building has a lot of requirements in order to secure a permit. I was told that if more than 100 people were to gather we would need to rent porta-potties. The application asked us to consider security and medics. I realized we needed a stage, sound, fencing, a generator. So we started building out a budget. Someone suggested we get event insurance. This is how we came to the estimate of $10, scary number. We started fund raising and people started donating. $10 here and $20 there. But it has added up to over $1


And in amongst all that,500 members on their FaceBook page. Chicago has over 3,600 members. Something about the Stewart/Colbert rallies has captured the public imagination. 


The satellite rally organizers are now talking about forming non-profit organizations to deal with all the donations. We are doing it to avoid personal liability. But, together with Stewart and Colbert, you have started something big. 


PS: By the way
 

TL;DR: It is expensive to responsibly create a good quality

Also, the rally is taking place on the Saturday before the election, and that in itself makes it political.

That all said, where the attendees didn't know anything when asked what they were for or against.  Many of them actually stated that they didn't know the specifics, but just knew for a fact that the healthcare bill and the Obama Administration were evil because Glenn Beck and Fox News told them so.

Show the world we are better than that because damnit

So here is Mom's advice:

1. If you are voting republican, green or ""the rent is too damn high"", know why.  Don't just say it's because you don't like the other party.  Know exactly what you like about the party you are voting for, and what you don't like about the party you are voting against.  If you are not going to vote, be prepared to say why that is.

2.  Know who the US Congressional and gubernatorial candidates are in your state.  You can go to your state's election website or look on your ballot to find out.  Be able to intelligently say why you are for them or against them.  It doesn't take that much time to check them out online.

3. If there are some major initiatives (amendments or propositions) on the ballot in your state (my state of CA has several important ones)

4. For extra credit it would be a good idea to educate yourself on what bills were passed by the House and Senate in the last 2 years and which ones failed.  Also, and what the Republican Party has accomplished as well.

Maybe you really couldn't give a rat's ass about politics

Even if you don't agree with the need to know any of the things I have suggested or aren't interviewed

If you think that this post of mine was inappropriate for this subreddit

**TL;DR:** Educate yourself a little about US politics before you attend the rallies.  Even if you don't think the rallies will be political

One last thing and Mom will shut up.  I am so proud of my Reddit community that my heart feels like it could burst.  The world is a better place because you are in it.

Oh, so please wear sunscreen.

I did not actually enjoy being there. A lot of this was admittedly due to poor planning. We got up at 4:30am, the main area was already shoulder to shoulder. There was plenty of room back across 7th, so we decided to set up there. We realized we wouldn't be able to see anything, but figured we'd be able to hear and would have a little space to breathe.  

Then the rally started. We realized quickly we weren't going to be able to hear anything, and we spent the rest of the day defending my grandparents and another elderly couple from the crowd, including many, many people who inexplicably thought that trying to plow over/through seated old people was a great idea. 

(There was a group of Redditors next to me who were helping out. We joked a bit, but I was not up for socializing.)

The metro on the way back was pretty much the same as the rally. Wall to wall people, etc. Understandable, but very unpleasant.

Some general info:

1) On metro escalators

2) Cool bars/restaurants, dupont circle (red line), eastern market (behind capitol, blue and orange lines), and gallery place/chinatown (red, yellow, and green lines).  I also like hanging out in the courthouse clarendon area since it is close to me (orange line, but I find it can get a bit douche-y in the later evenings.

Restoring Truthiness can't end on 10/30/10

So much of what is happening now is related to experiences we all shared, the Great Recession, the take over of radicalism, the birth of fear, and a historical presidential campaign based on hope and change where more youth participated than any previous election.

We want Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to rally because we're tired of the misinformation from news organizations (namely Fox News). We're upset about radicalism taking over politics and slowly dismantling our nation's ability to take care of itself (how Republicans are voting ""no"" to everything

We're so upset that we band together to raise over $250

But that shouldn't be the end of it. It **can't** be the end of it. 9/12 wasn't the end of the Tea Party rally. Why should 10/30?

What if we used this momentum for more positives? What if we continued to donate to DonorsChoose.org with monthly goals? Why stop there? What if we continued the ""March to Keep Fear Alive"" on Halloween

Of course those may be terrible ideas

We can't let Restoring Truthiness end on 10/30/10. We can't keep the reputation of being ""the lazy youth"" that the generations prior were. We need to solve these problems now and not inherit them in the future when we're ""old enough to care.""

3. If the suing party wins, it can be a precedent setting case regarding 501(c)(4) corporations. If they lose, it just further highlights the obvious problem and serves comedic purpose for Colbert.

Why Potter and Colbert would do this: it's obvious that they intend to go as far with this as possible to test the system, it can be a blow to the ridiculous system.

Why Cuban would do this: he's seems to have sensible political views. He's doesn't avoid controversy

First of all

Feel free to skip around this review as it might be long for some to slog through. Unlike the people with smartphones, but a weekend in NYC can be hectic. still exhausted today.]

Some were there for the music, including his hilarious endorsement of Pepsi at one point, the one that may not make it on the show (I missed last night's episode, so who knows).... Stephen took a swig of Pepsi, then announced a new Pepsi slogan to the crowd: ""Pepsi....Put It In Your Mouth"" , and later did another Pepsi promo with ""Pepsi...the official drink of my throat."" As I told my host in Manhatten the next day...when you sign up to sponsor Colbert with your product, you take a gamble (a damn good one). 

the music (!!!) :
Santigold was soulful, one couldn't help but ponder the lyrics like it was the first time ever hearing it. On the other side of comedic genius is the ability to stare into the dark abyss of life, embrace the duality of it all, and that's why Colbert Report is so closely linked to good music. Colbchella was punch-in-the-face satire juxtaposed with heart-rending soul.  

It was really cool to see Colbert at one point get into the middle of the crowd and do a segment surrounded by the audience. I was watching the video feedback on the big screen of what they were taping, and be with Colbert....these weren't bored tourists sitting in on a Jimmy Fallon taping and being instructed to clap or smile, but a crowd of kids who would have sailed off on the Intrepid with Colbert and conquered Staten Island if he asked us to. While looking for pictures, I saw a great Colbert-ism from Colbchella on the Village Voice blog that I had almost forgotten about--

------
""The cockfighting is BYO cock."" Colbert pronouncing the Hudson River as international waters, and cockfighting.""
------


Colbert was by far the best concert host I've ever seen....yeah, but the whole time Colbert was on stage, it was magic. I've seen my share of big-name comedians perform on stage, but have never seen someone as comfortable and quick-on-his-feet. I don't know what would faze Colbert. Whenever the show director announced that shot would have to be re-taped, Colbert would do it again with even more hilarious ad-libs than the time before. For example, when his sincere and funny intro for Grizzly Bear didn't get taped right, he did it again but better. It would be amazing to have film of the entire night just to appreciate all the bloopers, etc. For me, delicious combo. 

I got to the line at the Intrepid just before 6pm, a fellow Colbert junkie and myself commiserated on the genius of Colbert. While Jon Stewart may poke fun at current events, Colbert actually makes himself PART of them, yet rarely issues statements or overt judgements on events, just merely asking questions that expose logical fallacies (..like Socrates, you could say justly). We agreed that Colbert's testimony before Congress was the premier highlight of his comic genius, both in terms of crossing over into the ""real world"" in his character, not just a couple of punchlines. 


I'm no Hunter S Thompson, but all of them mentioning how a couple performers had to do songs twice for the taping due to technical errors. 

It's true, that when they both had to repeat one of their respective songs, the crowd just got louder and more hyped. For those of us who've seen reggae music live, seeing a song more than once in a concert is not only common, but popular with crowds. 

Some of us in line pondered the complimentary drink tickets described in our audience letters, and bottled water were plentiful. Colbert really was a damn good host of the Intrepid, and I'd follow the guy into battle anytime....especially after seeing his tassle shimmy in the Admiral's uniform. 

All of the music was really great

and yes

He states that not all Republicans would be on board with the narrative of Fox news. He then states that Fox news would choose a Democrat if s/he holds the view that's in line with the argument made by Fox news. 

In other words, although they overlap often, are not identical. He's making a nuanced argument. Regular viewers know that Jon would NEVER say that Fox is an unbiased organization. So chill with all the posts about ""Jon Steward says Fox is not Partisan!!"" crap...

* Your paper card goes in the front of the machine
* If you enter
* Parking lots have a flat cost of about $4.50. It's not based on time.
* You need a Smart Trip card to exit at most parking garages
* A Smart Trip card costs you about $20
* You can add money to a Smart Trip card at all the card machines.
* Smart Trip cards work similar to the paper cards except there's a scanner with an image of a card on it. It's pretty obvious.

* Stand on the right side of the escalator
* Do not stop when you reach the end of the escalator.
* If you have a baby carriage use the elevator. Virtually all stops have them
* When you're boarding a train move to the center quickly
* No eating or drinking on the trains or at the stations.

Allow me to explain the Arby’s plug

So in the pre-show Q&amp;A, and Stephen suggested that instead of execution, people on death row just be given Arby’s? I’m not sure, perhaps someone else can recall.

So the audience member asks if Stephen considered a segment where he actually did that: visited prisoners on death row and actually gave them Arby’s. Your quizzical reaction to that suggestion was mirrored by Stephen and the rest of the audience. After Stephen light-heartedly pushed for an answer

During that answer, had actually asked them to cut a joke from the night’s show; in what turned out to be the Cheating Death segment, he was going to make reference to the real side effects of a medication (for the de-aging rats, maybe?), which included runny stool. This would be followed by ""runny stool… why do I suddenly crave Arby’s?” Stephen said the general rule is that if a sponsor’s already in the news, it’s fair game, but Comedy Central asks for side jokes about sponsors to be removed (though Stephen kind of turned it into a one-minute one-man play by acting out how CC doesn’t directly ask for its removal

Also, but I could overhear/read his lips once the segment ended, and he got Paul Dinello to confirm that they’d just splice out the audio underneath a shot of the lynx. I watched the episode, and it’s so seamless, I assume that’s what they did. The second break/restart was during the Bill O’Reilly/tides segment, when he responded to a clip where Silverman sarcastically references Thor while arguing against O’Reilly. That clip/response was cut entirely from the episode (again, seamless – I can’t even remember where exactly it was in the segment). I can’t recall what the joke was; I think Stephen threw out the scripted joke when he did it the second time

After the sign-off, youthful appearance” on getting more sleep. Also, fun fact: they were gonna shoot the ending from the opposite corner of the desk, but with the lynx in the same spot, so that it would be standing on the desk, behind Stephen’s shoulder. But the lynx wouldn’t turn in the right direction, so it ended up being between Stephen and the camera, when the lynx came out originally,,False
