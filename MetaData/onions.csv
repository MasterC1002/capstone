Why are you ignoring this?",ayetoopie,162,35,44,"I have already mentioned this a number of times. The paper has also been posted both in /r/Tor and here. I feel as though a large part of this community is either ignorant of this or is downplaying it. This is from an academic paper. Those guys don't usually make baseless claims and it would be very much in the interest of your community to pay attention to what they have shown.

From another post of mine:

In fact, they are unsafe ,as shown by [this paper](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf), which was published about a month ago. I am still a bit baffled as to why this isn't given much more attention in this subreddit. I consider it required reading for everyone in here.

Here's what it boils down to:

&gt;IX. Conclusion

&gt;**We have analyzed the security properties of Tor hidden services and shown that attacks to deanonymize hidden services at a large scale are practically possible with only a moderate amount of resources. We have demonstrated that collecting the descriptors of all Tor hidden services is possible in approximately 2 days by spending less than USD 100 in Amazon EC2 resources. Running one or more guard nodes then allows an attacker to correlate hidden services to IP addresses using a primitive traffic analysis attack.** Furthermore

&gt;To address these vulnerabilities we have proposed countermeasures. These prevent hidden service directories from learning the content of any the descriptors unless they also know their corresponding onion address and significantly increase the resources required to selectively become a hidden service directory for a targeted hidden service.

1370242924.0,1fkgti,"PSA: Do not use TorShops, EuCanna, Peoples Drug Store or EasyCoin wallet.",NekroTor,138,6

Earlier I received an e-mail from someone frantically encouraging me to take down TorShops off the Cleaned Hidden Wiki. They alleged that the vendor stole $500 from them and that he'd actually faked a ton of feedback across various sites and even came up with elaborate forums/communities as a part of the operation. I get these e-mails once a week - occasionally from a legit scam

However, searched around a bit for archived e-mails (I occasionally keep them when someone asks me to add something to CHW - can become useful in events like these), and finally found it. He'd asked me to add 3 different links to CHW - [EuCanna](http://rso4hutlefirefqp.onion/), [EasyCoin](http://easycoinsayj7p5l.onion), and the actual [TorShops](http://shopsat2dotfotbs.onion/) site. This maybe should've sent alarm bells ringing (this wide of a variety of products is rare unless you have a whole team working on it). I thought nothing of it, the sites looked pretty fancied up and it likely took effort to build them so I didn't worry about it too much.

Fast forward a bit

Fast forward to today. I check out EasyCoin. I notice the banner at the top of the page - it advertises the clearnet URL and .onion URL. I check out the [clearnet site](http://easycoin.net). 

This is what sent me for a loop. The banner at the top didn't include any .onion address. In fact

The reason why I included Peoples Drug Store. [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1a10fo/torshops_create_your_own_onion_store_with_full/). Site located at [this](http://newpdsuslmzqazvr.onion/) URL.

All of these drug sites include escrow. The escrow is provided by the drug sites. All of these sites appear custom-made except for EasyCoin (which is where this scam artist dun fuck'd up).

Moral of the story: Trust *NO ONE* in Onionland. Never go by appearances alone. Use a guaranteed third party escrow that isn't affiliated with the vendor. Make reviews regarding vendors in [Evil|Wiki's Reviews page](http://wvk32thojln4gpp4.onion/wiki/index.php/Reviews). Always warn others if you come across a scam.

About a month or two ago, it doesn't matter so much now. 

Since the Administrator left the edit wars started off slowly, eventually that persistance and the Hidden Wiki's dominance laid the foundations for a small market of those that would sit there for hours on end replacing links and combating spammers. Of course, the otherside then grew to like this technique too and the Edit Wars spiralled. 

Over the last week or so we have seen the culmination of this where one

A while back if one would care to check the history, including blank pages, including hello world pages. Some users thought that scams and phishing attempts shouldn't be listed which was in effect the start of the war. 

This war against the bot has escalated into the other side also using a bot (apparently) and so the Hidden Wiki has effectively been crippled by a Sandbox scenario. I think this teaches us something important about Human behaviour. 

Humans, then the whole reason why the two sides were fighting in the first place will be destroyed and returned to dust. It's clear from this 'simulation' that some framework or structure of authority is required in order to ensure some sense of fair play, especially if trying to protect or rather preserve a resource. 

It goes to show that true liberty cannot exist without the rule of law. I would also caution that law should only be there to organize and make society more efficient rather than being there to follow the whim of whoever holds the majority at the time. This sounds contradictory

1. **What happened?**
The biggest hosting service for hidden services (onions) got caught. FBI took down his servers

2. **Does this mean Tor/Silk Road/Insert hidden service is not safe anymore?**
Not necessarily. Until we know how he was caught we do not know if this method could be used against other services and/or users.

3. **I heard he was caught by Java exploit which backtracked him?**
No. As far as we know the owner of Freedom Hosting did NOT get caught BECAUSE OF the JavaSCRIPT exploit but the FBI (or someone else) inserted it to all Freedom Hosting websites AFTER they caught him to catch visitors of websites hosted on his servers.

4. **I am on Windows
Possibly. Yes if you visited a FH website last week using a version Tor Browser Bundle BEFORE v0.2.3.25-10 OR with a Firefox version before 17.0.7 WITHOUT disabling all scripts.

5. **I am on Linux/Mac/Tails/Newest TBB. Should I be worried?**
Most likely no.

6. **Is this good or bad?**
Depends. He did not only host arguably terrible material but also many useful legal services. Services which could have been used in country's with oppressive regimes. He is not a ""CP host"" like the media tells you but a host without rules on which people from around the world hosted all kinds of websites. I hate CP but true freedom is also for things you hate the most.
FBI exploit is bad because it will catch lots of innocent people.

7. **Now what.**
Use Tails if you can. ALWAYS DISABLE SCRIPTS.

8. **OMG I PLACED WEED SR ORDER HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD I FORMAT???**
Over 9000.


Interesting facts: 

+ FH owner started a new service called ""Onion Bank"" days before the take down. My guess is he screwed up.
+ The owner of FH was the owner of Tormail.org
+ FH did not only host CP. Legal services (like Tormail) are hosted on FH. FBI exploit is on these legal websites too.

Of course even if they can get your traffic, as the authorities could easily bend the certification authorities to their will and then act as a man in the middle on the exit nodes, impersonating the public key of the intended destination.

The 'web of trust' approach (used by PGP?) could work there though I guess as then even if the web is compromised only a few people's communications would be vulnerable rather than everyones.

Like a lot of you

Every time I would get to the end of the guide, and my network connection would continuously time out.

After spending endless hours troubleshooting I think I've finally got it sorted



First up:

* This method has been tested on Windows 7 only - you may be able to tweak the guide for XP

* It is assumed that your intention is to browse using Tor network solely inside your Ubuntu VM (and not on your main PC).

* For this guide you **MUST** use Ubuntu 11.10 as your VM OS -***not*** Ubuntu 10.10 [(ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso)](http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&amp;bits=32&amp;release=latest)

* I allocated my DSL Firewall VM 128MB RAM, but I thought it was worth mentioning just in case.

* None of the **optional** steps in the original guide were followed (ie installing IRC &amp; Torchat).

* Aside from the changes I've listed in this tutorial

* Even if you have already performed the original guide multiple times

----------

Ok


**1 : Obtaining Tor Browser**


Instead of installing the Tor Browser Bundle




* Once it's downloaded

* Hit 'Next'

* Hit 'Next'

* Once the installer finishes hit 'Next' then 'Finish'

The Vidalia Control Panel should pop up and after a while you'll get the message 'Connected to the Tor network!'

Hit 'Hide' and continue on with **'Section 3 : Securing Your Harddrive'** in the original guide.


**11 : Installing Ubuntu**

***Installing the VirtualBox Guest Additions***
 
When you're at the end of **'Section 11. Installing Ubuntu'** in the original guide (just after you've recorded your encryption passphrase) perform the following steps:

* Up in the top right corner you should see a little icon that's a picture of some green hardware with a lock - click it and select 'Install Drivers' from the dropdown box.

* An 'Additional Drivers' box should pop up with some text that mentions 'x86 virtualization solution - guest addition module source for dkms'

* Click 'Activate' in the lower right corner

The VirtualBox Guest Additions will now download and install.
Once it's finished

* Click 'Close'




* ****&gt;&gt;&gt; As you have already installed the Guest Additions using an alternative method
----------

* ****&gt;&gt;&gt; I also skipped Sections 14 &amp; 15 and did not install IRC or Torchat &lt;&lt;&lt;**** *
----------

**16 : Creating TOR-Only Internet Environment**

Once you have completed **Step 20** in the original guide (finished configuring Firefox to use Tor)

* Click on the Wireless Radio icon that's over to the right up in the top menu bar

* Your default connection should be named something like 'Wired connection 1' - click on it
* ***Uncheck*** the box next to 'Connect Automatically' and hit 'Save'

You've almost finished! Now return to the original guide and continue on from **Step 21** - hopefully this time you will get a connection when you perform the final steps!

----------
So that's it - I hope this guide can help some of you out. I'm really just a n00b at all this

The service consist of something like:
User --&gt; .onion --&gt; Tor --&gt; Service  --&gt; Tor --&gt; Normal IP:Port

(Basically you enter a .onion address in the tor browser and that gets routed to an IP:Port that you previously specified)

Of course this has a fee (small)
[The implementation of this one is almost finished]

2) Another service i'm thinking to implement is a VPS service with tor integrated in ""low level"" layers, get # and finally do ""apt-get update"" and everything fully anonymous. Nobody (nor you) will ever know where the server is hosted and you will get all the feeling of a normal vps. The downside is that only TCP traffic will work out of the box, but you can setup a VPN to fix this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3) Vanity address generation (.onion, bitcoin addr, etc) for a fee.

4) PHP+MySQL webhosting. Free small accounts and paid upgrades.

5) Long term backup service. You pay months/years plans and i store your data in a safe place in some points of the world. Then when you need it you just download it the same as you stored it.

6) I'm open to ideas.

I want to run a service based on tor so i'm collecting my own ideas and i'm also open to suggestions/requests. I have far more the required technical knowledge to run any of the services described above and i'm sure that i will be capable to run any suggestion too.

Let's try set a new onionland standard....it's the first onion file-share site to incorporate: 

* Chat
* Account management: mass delete
* Community moderation: Vote down accounts which the community sees as bad for business
* Browse: From the left menu

**Features**

* Simplicity: No usernames
* Encryption: Raw files don't touch the hard-disc. Data encrypted on-the-fly as you upload. Not even a temporary file is used. Database text is encrypted before written.
* Sharing: browse each others uploads
* Freedom: Your account
* Chat: basic chat board (think late 90's style)
* No scripts: the site is light weight and has no images or java scripts to serve the pure HTML.There is a CSS script.
* Dynamic: upvote and downvote entire accounts into oblivion (Feedback on this feature please)
* Privacy: Account status can be set to private or public
* Flexibility: Nominate which members can see your profile / files


**To-do**

* Messaging: Private messaging
* Security: Locate and address security concerns. Community feedback requested!
* Load test: the site has yet to serve multiple simultaneous clients. 
* Client-side encryption: For private accounts only. If there is demand then this should be implemented too.

* **who built it?** - Just me! For now its a one-person show folks.

[Edit 3]

**Important**: If your files are not to be snooped at  then client side manual encryption is a must. This foremost is a file-sharing site with the emphasis being in sharing. The 256AES encryption on this site is implemented as a safety net for everyone as a community and especially the admins if there server lost/stolen etc.

The ""Browse"" and ""Recent 50"" button on the left menu show your account and files

**To-Do**:

 What feature do you want to see in a file sharing website on Tor?

[Edit March 9] 
Update: Database isn't great with simultaneous users online. I assume its poor coding from me. This means soon all the files will be wiped and new database install.

5 - run ""service tor start"" to (re)start Tor and confirm correct version

6 - when updates are complete

7 - (re)launch Vidalia (Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; Vidalia).

When your onion goes from yellow to green

You should also confirm the correct running version in the root terminal. You should also get this notice: ""[notice] This version is not a stable Tor release. Expect more bugs than usual."" This is the whole bleeding-edge part I mentioned earlier.

I'd like to get a discussion going on system security here. Share your setup, I'll share my setup:

* Firefox, and all essential system services running in a secure sandbox. The sandbox is provided by a Linux kernel level [mandatory access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) implementation known as [Tomoyo](http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en). This sandbox protects against exploits, both known and unknown by restricting programs to only predetermined behaviors. It also prevents clear net access by denying tor clients (i.e. Firefox) network access to anything other than the Tor network.

* Firefox browser profile stored in an AES encrypted kernel-level stacked filesystem ([eCryptfs](http://ecryptfs.org/)).

* Firefox configured to disable JavaScript, so you could theoretically use a feature full Firefox in a tight sandbox!).

I have a lot of faith in my Linux drive because whatever information is unintentionally stored on my computer will be wiped clean as soon as I switch back to my main operating system; is this faith well placed?

With this system I am fairly certain that my laptop will be protected from being tracked or infected with malicious software.  And if for whatever reason

1. A cool (non US based ) domain. I am feeling something like ""MrAwesome@Ghostmail.sx"" .sx is what The pirate bay uses

2. Make it compatible with TOR.

3. Make it functional and good nice to look at. Why do all encrypted email services have to look like 1995?

4. Features

5. End to end encryption. 

6. Self Destruct feature. All email sent to unsecured email addresses like Gmail

7. Temporary accounts and/or aliases for those one time emails. 

8. The company has no owner. It is owned by the people. I am not sure exactly how to do this

9. A developer to take our hard earned Kickstarter loot. 

10. Someone to make a nifty

11. IOS and Android support. 

12...  Public elections to pick the caretakers. The potential caretakers should submit an application and a Resume to say the top backers who will then go through them all and choose say 5 - 10 people who will sign an agreement to take care of the website

What do you guys think? I think we can do all this for under 20K and do it in a really professional way. If we can get 5K backers that runs USD $4.00 each.

###How it works

I want to avoid registration, send the Bitcoin to a certain address, and get the same amount (minus fee) in a new address within a day.

This isn't possible with a specific amount of coins (such as 3.825)

But the mixing service needs payment

| Deposit   | New Address |
|:-----------|------------:|
| 0.1005     | 0.1000      |        
| 1.0010     | 1.0000      |    
| 10.0100   |10.0000     | 

How does the mixing service know where to send the coins? I propose an input either from a website or even over email

- The ""dirty"" public address of the sender
- The new ""clean"" public address they want to fund
- The amount they are sending - probably choosing a tier
- The exact time they will send the coins

Once a deposit is made, then after an appropriate waiting period to ensure there are no other claims on the same deposit, then the coins would be deposited in the sender's clean address.

If there are multiple claims with the same accurate time

This system would only work if there are many incoming deposits in the same amount. Before the service became popular

Once the service is popular enough, but could be adjusted based on number of deposits. I imagine larger tiers (such as 100BTC) would receive limited enough deposits that they might make less frequent dispersal.

An obvious problem with mixing services is trust, and anyone with brains would rather run a profitable operation for a long time without ripping anyone off than destroy your reputation by cheating people.

Those are my thoughts. I'd love feedback here

If you want to contact me privately

TL;DR **I'm proposing a simpler system for Bitcoin mixing that doesn't require registration or withdrawal requests,False,self,t5_2r552,False,,,t3_1fpbsd

1. Looking at code from a few .onion sites it looks just like regular html. Is the only difference the way its hosted? If so

2. As far as hosting, as far as using one of my own computers as a server, is there any good tutorials on that anyone can link me to? I understand the concept and that its relatively easy, but is there a drastic difference from hosting a .com and a .onion? All the tutorials i find are on hosting .com's.

1333666765.0,rve21,Consider running a Tor node,DMBuce,2,0,0,"In the wake of new subscribers coming from /r/BestOf
people to consider running a Tor node. I'm guessing a lot of you
don't have much use for Tor. But maybe you want to help out the Tor
network and the people who use it. Setting up a node is a relatively easy way
to do that.

I'm nowhere near as brilliant as the Tor developers and I have
neither the time nor the expertise to describe all the ins and
outs of being an operator of all the various node types in detail. So instead
I'm just gonna describe a few things I considered when setting up a node as a
starting point for further research (the [Tor
project](https://www.torproject.org/) and google are both good resources).

First thing I considered was whether or not running a node was a good idea.
I got motivated to set one up by [this talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX46Qv_b7F4) given by two Tor
developers at 28c3. I think it's fantastic that by operating a node
helping out dissidents and citizens of oppressive governments
it's important to realize that Tor also enables people to hire assassins and
distribute CP
node. Ultimately
their anonymity online is generally a good thing
differently.

Another thing to consider is the risk involved
exit node. Traffic leaving the Tor network through your node will appear to be
coming from that node's IP
downloading copyrighted media
notice from RIAA. If a website gets spammed by someone
one they'll block. [These](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/five-years-exit-node-operator) [two](https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node) blog posts cover how to mitigate a lot of
these risks. TL;DR
regular browsing.

It might also be worthwhile to consider running a [bridge
relay](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) or onion service. I haven't
done either of these so can't really say much about them. What I can say
is that if I were to run an onion site
as humanly possible.

I need to be able to pay online anonymously for a VPS to run a Tor Hidden Service. Bitcoin is not an option. I've looked into prepaid credit card but every single one I find needs to be activated with an ID card or a passport.

I'm new to the Deep Web (in fact I just downloaded the Tor Client this night). I'm really just curious why there is so much hype about the deep web and I have a few questions about the Client and Deep Web:

1. How anonymous am I when browsing sites like the ""Silk Road"" or the ""Hidden Wiki""?

2. What are entry/exit nodes?

3. Will my ISP/Govt. Agencies know that I am browsing on tor (even in the legal sections)?

I'm just a little startled about my anonymity and security. I have read a few articles that talked about how my identity can be compromised through exit nodes,,False,self,t5_2r552,False,,True

1340121649.0,va43l,Advice on using The Pirate Bay on TOR,,7,6,10,"So The Pirate Bay was blocked in the UK recently. I've used TOR and The Pirate Bay before with no problems. However

Before it was blocked, click ""Download this torrent using magnet."" Then, a message saying something like ""An external application is needed to handle:..."" would pop up, and I'd click ""launch application"". UTorrent would click in, I'd choose the folder to download into and the torrent would download. Easy peasy. Using Tor, when I click ""launch application"" nothing happens. The dialogue box disappears, UTorrent doesn't kick in and nothing is downloaded.

I'm guessing there's an easy way to fix this
