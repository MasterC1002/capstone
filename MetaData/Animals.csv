Today I did.  There was the little orange cat tied to a string that reminded me of my cat. I went to the front of the crowd of tourists to watch this individual take out a bunch of sedatives and proceeded to shove one down a cats mouth

I caused a scene. A big one.  

I proceeded to yell at the man and ask him “How are those sedatives working out for you?” The man yelled at me when I pulled out my phone to call the cops. He told me I couldn’t stop him and he would just move his location. So I spent the next few minutes informing every person watching this man that he was a piece of shit and sedates and abuses the animals. I told them not to give him any money

Needless to say, where they will most likely be put to sleep anyway? He won’t be arrested. He will go back to a shelter and just get a different batch of animals to exploit.

If it wasn’t for the fact that I am positive he changes his batch of animals every few months

I hope I did the right thing. I think I did. But I ask all of you to take a minute and watch this video. Share it if you want. But if you see him around, the better chance we have of stopping him.

He was very thin

I didnt know what I should do to be doing right

I drove back to try and get the dog but he was gone-I drove back and forth a few times but no luck. Eventually I got home and told my parents-they said they would drive up this time and we could see what we could do. So we drove up and the dog wasnt in the lane again. 

However there was no one around so I opened the farm gates and walked about a bit and eventually the dog came out-I lifted it and it allowed me to without so much as a whimper. I have to also say the farm was a total hellhole and there were a few sheep running around in the same state as the dog.

So my Dad and I got the dog into the back of the car and drove straight to the vets. They could not believe how bad it looked either. They put a lead on it to take it through to the kennels and it just looked up at me and would not budge. Everyone was saying I had just made a friend! 

So the vets assured me they would wash and shave it tonight-the fur is so matted it will require a lot of shaving

I cannot tell you how glad I feel to have been able to do something for that poor dog. Tonight I know it is warm

I am also reporting that farm to the relevant authorities on Monday morning

My plan is to leave him at the backyard for the night where he will be safe away from any animals around this area.  Tomorrow maybe make a flyer and post it around to see if its a lost pet.

Here is few pictures from today [Link to imgur gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Ij7wf)

Reddit please help!  I am not sure if I am doing the right thing here.

Edit: 

Thanks for all the help everyone.  The pigeon is now in my garage

**Update**

**So looks like for now we will keep him until we find the owner.  He seems to be very friendly

Got him some birdfeed as suggested by pet store employee

I have a personal hatred of healthy animals being put down due to no other reason than they cant find a home for them.

So I have decided to create this subreddit to try and find pets a new home. Every animal deserves love and care
