Retroactively

Not too long after finishing the stories, which, mostly thanks to NoSleep, was a huge success. In August, I [published the book on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Penpal-Dathan-Auerbach/dp/098554550X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349741729&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=penpal).

Before the book had even launched, who won an Oscar for the documentary Undefeated this year. After talking for a while, we reached an agreement, and he is now officially on board to produce the film adaptation of *Penpal*! Rich has just started shopping the book around in an attempt to get it set up in Hollywood, so we've still got a ways to go, but I'm hopeful that we'll get there.

I never anticipated things getting this far, I'm proud that it started on Reddit.

This is George Carlin as Cardinal Glick during the DOGMA shoot in Pittsburgh

The first time I met George Carlin was May of 1997 at the Conan O'Brien show, so I brought a DOGMA script along in hopes of asking Curious George to play Cardinal Glick - the marketing maven behind the Buddy Christ. 

But shortly before the show, but you could tell he was heartbroken. I didn't bug him with DOGMA that night.

I'd meet the master again a month later at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. He'd already read DOGMA and we were grabbing lunch to talk about whether or not he wanted to be in it. He said he was into it but had one request.

George asked if Cardinal Glick could have a bandage on his finger, he wasn't ready to take it off just yet.

NOTE: I did NOT write this post

Link: http://cavalorn.livejournal.com/584135.html#cutid1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Prometheus contains such a huge amount of mythic resonance that it effectively obscures a more conventional plot. I'd like to draw your attention to the use of motifs and callbacks in the film that not only enrich it

Let's begin with the eponymous titan himself, until Prometheus gave them fire. This was a big no-no, as fire was supposed to be the exclusive property of the Gods. As punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock and condemned to have his liver ripped out and eaten every day by an eagle. (His liver magically grew back, in case you were wondering.)

Fix that image in your mind

The ethos of the titan Prometheus is one of willing and necessary sacrifice for life's sake. That's a pattern we see replicated throughout the ancient world. J G Frazer wrote his lengthy anthropological study, because that was what heaven demanded, and fertility would not ensue if he did not do his royal duty of dying.

Now, it doesn't matter. A lone Engineer at the top of a waterfall goes through a strange ritual, drinking from a cup of black goo that causes his body to disintegrate into the building blocks of life. We see the fragments of his body falling into the river, twirling and spiralling into DNA helices. 

Ridley Scott has this to say about the scene: 'That could be a planet anywhere. All he’s doing is acting as a gardener in space. And the plant life, and at the end of that year, he would be taken and donated to the gods in hopes of improving what might happen next year, be it with crops or weather, etcetera.'

Can we find a God in human history who creates plant life through his own death, the epitome of all the Frazerian 'Dying Gods'.

And we wouldn't be amiss in seeing the first of the movie's many Christian allegories in this scene, let this cup pass from me.'

So, up to and including self-sacrifice, is right and proper in the creation of life. Prometheus, Osiris, John Barleycorn, and of course the Jesus of Christianity are all supposed to embody this same principle. It is held up as one of the most enduring human concepts of what it means to be 'good'.

Seen in this light, and preservation of life. We also discover, through hints, exactly what the nature of the clash between the Engineers and humanity entailed.

The crew of the Prometheus discover an ancient chamber, if you did as I asked earlier on, you will recognise instantly: the lifegiver with his abdomen torn open. Go and look at it here to refresh your memory. Note the serenity on the Engineer's face here. 

And there's another mural there, devouring and destroying others purely to preserve itself. As Ash puts it: 'a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.'

Through Shaw and Holloway's investigations, complete with star diagram showing us the way to find them?) We have to assume, then, that for a good few hundred thousand years, they were pretty happy with us. They could have destroyed us at any time, but instead, they effectively invited us over; the big pointy finger seems to be saying 'Hey, when you're grown up enough to develop space travel

From the Engineers' perspective, and the film hints at when, if not why: the Engineers at the base died two thousand years ago. That suggests that the event that turned them against us and led to the huge piles of dead Engineers lying about was one and the same event. We did something very, very bad, and somehow the consequences of that dreadful act accompanied the Engineers back to LV-223 and massacred them.

If you have uneasy suspicions about what 'a bad thing approximately 2

Movies.com: We had heard it was scripted that the Engineers were targeting our planet for destruction because we had crucified one of their representatives

Ridley Scott: We definitely did, running around with armor and skirts, which of course would be the Roman Empire. And they were given a long run. A thousand years before their disintegration actually started to happen. And you can say, ""Let's send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it."" Guess what? They crucified him.

Yeah. The reason the Engineers don't like us any more is that they made us a Space Jesus

So, hey, there's the 'lifegiver with his abdomen torn open' motif again. That's three times now: Prometheus, Engineer mural, Jesus Christ. And I don't think I have to mention the 'sacrifice in the interest of giving life' bit again, do I? Everyone on the same page? Good.

So how did our (in the context of the film) terrible murderous act of crucifixion end up wiping out all but one of the Engineers back on LV-223? Presumably through the black slime, and the black stuff engenders fertile life. But expose the potent black slimy stuff to the thoughts and emotions of flawed humanity, and 'the sleep of reason produces monsters'. We never see the threat that the Engineers were fleeing from, we never see them killed other than accidentally (decapitation by door), and we see no remaining trace of whatever killed them. Either it left a long time ago, or it reverted to inert black slime, waiting for a human mind to reactivate it.

The black slime reacts to the nature and intent of the being that wields it, because he was an android.

Shaw's comment when the urn chamber is entered - 'we've changed the atmosphere in the room' - is deceptively informative. The psychic atmosphere has changed, drawing not from a self-sacrificing Engineer but from human hunger for knowledge, for more life, for more everything. Little wonder, then, that it takes serpent-like form. The symbolism of a corrupting serpent, turning men into beasts

Refusal to accept death is anathema to the Engineers. Right from the first scene, because it's not clear why it should have done so. Perhaps the Engineer wanted to die again, to undo the tainted human agenda of new life without sacrifice.",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/uswn1/prometheus_everything_explained_and_analysed/

     There is an explosion. The public is *surprised*, let us take a *suspense* situation. The bomb is underneath the table and the public *knows* it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is *aware* that the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions this same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene. The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ""You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. There's a bomb beneath you and it's about to explode!""
      In the first scene we have given the public fifteen seconds of *surprise* at the moment of the explosion. In the second we have provided them with fifteen minutes of *suspense*. The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed. Except when the surprise is a twist, in itself, the highlight of the story.

Alfred. Gordon. Lucius. Bruce . . . Wayne. Names that have come to mean so much to me. Today, building demolitions, or mayhem thousands of feet in the air have become familiar.

People ask if we’d always planned a trilogy. This is like being asked whether you had planned on growing up, we flirted with what might come after, then backed away, not wanting to look too deep into the future. I didn’t want to know everything that Bruce couldn’t; I wanted to live it with him. I told David and Jonah to put everything they knew into each film as we made it. The entire cast and crew put all they had into the first film. Nothing held back. Nothing saved for next time. They built an entire city. Then Christian and Michael and Gary and Morgan and Liam and Cillian started living in it. Christian bit off a big chunk of Bruce Wayne’s life and made it utterly compelling. He took us into a pop icon’s mind and never let us notice for an instant the fanciful nature of Bruce’s methods.

I never thought we’d do a second—how many good sequels are there? Why roll those dice? But once I knew where it would take Bruce, as brought to terrifying life by Heath. We’d held nothing back, but there were things we hadn’t been able to do the first time out—a Batsuit with a flexible neck, shooting on Imax. And things we’d chickened out on—destroying the Batmobile, burning up the villain’s blood money to show a complete disregard for conventional motivation. We took the supposed security of a sequel as license to throw caution to the wind and headed for the darkest corners of Gotham.

I never thought we’d do a third—are there any great second sequels? But I kept wondering about the end of Bruce’s journey, it was still there. It even seemed a little cleaner, a little more polished. Wayne Manor had been rebuilt. Familiar faces were back—a little older, a little wiser . . . but not all was as it seemed.

Gotham was rotting away at its foundations. A new evil bubbling up from beneath. Bruce had thought Batman was not needed anymore

Michael, Cillian, Liam, Heath, Christian . . . Bale. Names that have come to mean so much to me. My time in Gotham, looking after one of the greatest and most enduring figures in pop culture, has been the most challenging and rewarding experience a filmmaker could hope for. I will miss the Batman. I like to think that he’ll miss me

Remember that concept and overuse of orange and blue that we've seen in various movies and posters alike? Drive did it nicely without being obnoxious and distracting.

I took a few stills (spoiler-free) to show what I mean!

EDIT: For all those of you who are saying ""wow you noticed orange/blue in a hollywood film, orange/blue has been over-used and is very VERY common in Hollywood films. That is NOT the point here. It's about the level of execution and how it was done. Rather than relying completely on post-production colour grading to achieve this effect (which when done badly results in an over-saturated distracting picture,) they used key objects, costumes, backgrounds, and background objects for a more natural look and to create depth. And when the post grading shows, it's nicely done and not intrusive. That is something I haven't seen used so well many pictures.

The movie is hand-animated in 2D except for the giant

Also a [line graph!](http://imgur.com/lXeGp)


&gt; By popular demand


The 2012 numbers are through August.

To save time and not research every single movie released since 1998


**Interesting things to note:**

*2003 saw the biggest drop in wait time

*2012 is on track for the shortest average wait time so far

*The first movie to crack 90 days was the 2003 movie Mona Lisa Smile, 2004. A wait of 81 days.

*The shortest overall wait was the 2007 Ben Stiller movie The Heartbreak Kid, 2007, just 77 days later.

*The longest wait was the 2002 movie The Santa Clause 2, 2003. A wait of 382 days, though not unusual for a Christmas movie.

*Also not surprisingly

Ok. Any questions?


**EDIT:** Standard Deviation: about 22.5 (days)

**EDIT 2:** Okay

**EDIT 3:** Holy crap this took off. To appease the masses

**EDIT 4:** Because a lot of people have mentioned it, 1994. At least that's the date I've seen mentioned the most.

**EDIT 5:** Back again this morning, so do with it what you want. Can't wait to see what people come up with. I'm also trying to work on adjusting this for inflation.

**EDIT 6:** Okay, so some years saw a significant drop in the number of movies that hit $100 million, while some years didn't see much of a drop.",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/z1393/for_the_past_couple_days_i_have_been_researching/

Yesterday in my press conference in Cannes for Chinese 12 Zodiac I said that this movie was my last big action movie. 

Today I was shocked when I woke up to read all the news coverage that I was retiring from doing Action movies.

I just want to let everyone know that I am not retiring from doing action movies. What I meant to say is that I need to do less of the life risking stunts on my movies. After all these years of doing so many stunts and breaking so many bones

I will continue to do international action movies.

And I will keep improving my English :-)

I love all of you!""

Stop giving it to them.,TheDark1,7942,5962,1309,"Yesterday I started [a new subreddit to try and encourage people to join me in boycotting hollywood](http://www.reddit.com/r/boycotthollywood/). I really think if we don't show the big players in the entertainment industry how we feel
  
Hollywood today is dominated by 6 big studios. They are (in order of market share) Warner Bros., Disney, Sony and NBC Universal.
  
We all know about Murdoch's anti - Obama platform - he has given his ""journalists"" (is there anything more powerful than inverted commas that can be used here?) carte blanc to attack Obama since the day he was sworn in. We know that NBC is a major backer of SOPA and we know that Disney has already had copyright law in the US changed to protect its older works. The others are no doubt well behind SOPA/PIPA as well.
  
These are not the only studios but together they account for about 80% of the movie industry in the USA.
  
My proposal is
  
A lot of mention has been made of watching films for free. I think this is a personal choice. I don't want to recommend it
  
I'll play games instead of watching movies. Give your pocket money to Good Guy Gabe instead of Scumbag Rupert!
  
  
Please make a new post in this subreddit telling us how you plan to avoid hollywood,we need more people, and more wallets.  
  
 Because in the end
  
EDIT: **I am not advocating piracy. I will happily pay for a quality product.** I am upset because hollywood want to stifle online innovation because they are too lazy. They have had it too easy for too long. Don't come here to post ""I love piracy"". This debate is not about piracy.       
  
EDIT2: Nice to make the front page but I'd prefer if everyone actually subscribed to the subreddit!  
  
EDIT3: Not about piracy.  
 
EDIT4: Not about piracy.  
  
UBEREDIT: Not about piracy. Allow me to elucidate again.   
  
Democracry in America is no longer about people, we need to understand how our dollars combined (are captain planet!) can influence the system. If you are interested in taking part of this movement because you don't want SOPA/PIPA to pass, then feel free to take part.  
  
I doubt this campaign will affect any jobs, they can unionize or strike, or just ask their bosses for a raise out of the obscene profits their bosses make. They should do what is best for them.  
  
Do I like this new democracy? Not a jot. I just think we all need to know how it works. Your vote means nothing. Your money means everything.  
  
For the several hundred people who simply posted ""not going to work"", I hope you joined the subreddit, and have a happy spring festival! Have some Chinese food, and remember to wish the waiter or waitress Gong Xi Fa Cai!  
  
EditX: JOBS!!!! AAAHHHH! Let me tell you
  
Edit(final): All those who say there are not enough of us, and the net is where the world meets now. We are the cool kids. Every studio is scrambling for comic book IP so they can show that they are ""down with the nerds"" and it is sickening how successful they have been. Boycott, change your FB status, twitter it, tell your parents! As Gandhi said, ""be the change you want to see in the world"" (also ""fuck bitches, get democracy"").",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/oosfe/i_urge_you_again_to_boycott_hollywood_they_are/

I think a lot of people have lost faith in Hollywood with all the crappy Reboots
I think if Luc Besson, Milla and Chris Tucker returned and the story was good, it could be an amazing film. Korben, Leloo and maybe their hybrid teenage child (suggested by someone in the comments) could be a family special forces squad, a bit like a Mass Effect squad going after whatever baddy they can think of (I still like my Dark version of Leloo, the Sixth or Dark Element.  
Edit 3: Well this has really divided a lot of redditors. 5000 downvotes and still on the front page
Edit 4: Still loving the suggestions the fun imaginative redditors are coming up with. I realise how poo mine are

-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any movie that they don't constantly hear about on reddit

**What it actually means:** a movie that wasn't critically well-received

Examples: We've all seen them. Every week someone calls Dredd ""underrated"" or some Oscar-nominated actor ""underrated."" It borders on self-parody at this point.

----------------------

**Homage**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any time that Tarantino (whom I love) steals an idea from another movie. But only Tarantino

**What it actually means:** A deliberate nod to another piece of work

Examples of real homages: 

The [staircase scene in *The Untouchables*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-3DKkIv9S8) referencing the massively famous [*Battleship Potemkin* ""Odessa steps"" sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-v-kZzfec). It should be noted that Brian de Palma walks the same fine line as Tarantino in terms of ""is he stealing, de Palma is a favorite of Tarantino's, as well as Goddard, who also openly admitted to stealing from other works.

Charlize Theron walking on water in *Arrested Development*

John Wayne [grabbing his elbow in *The Searchers*](http://youtu.be/GXUz-Nntyks?t=47s)

Homages are typically *obvious* to the audience, it's making an overt gesture to tell fans how much you respect another piece of work.

Tarantino says that he [steals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LYT4JC2dd4)

Another [one

-------------------------------------

**Pretentious**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means:**

- Anyone who uses big words

- Anyone who speaks with a condescending tone

- Movies that are enigmatic

Examples of movies that are often called ""pretentious"" by /r/movies: The Master, Crash

**What it actually means:** when art tries to be showier and deeper than it actually is

Subjective Examples: Terrence Malick (whom I also love) is often criticized as pretentious. Why? Because in a lot of movies he has whispering voice over deliberately stating how characters feel, when we're all-of-a-sudden supposed to care about two characters because the music changed and the sun is setting *just so* behind Megan Fox as she tries to hold on to Shia LeBoof's hand. Transporter also did this, constantly switching music to try its best at making us feel something for the characters. Man on Fire did this same technique with more success, prob due to just better filmmaking, acting, story, and characters. Wong Kar Wai's *Happy Together* was critically successful uses the same (years earlier) technique of constantly changing film stock and self-conscious cinematography

Whatever *is* pretentious is obviously subjective

---------------------

**Foreshadowing**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any conceptual link between an event earlier in a movie to what occurs later in the movie. I often describe it as ""the astrology of film theory"" because so many people want to believe that [every little nuanced thing in films is part of some larger grand scheme](http://www.room237movie.com/about/). Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar

Examples:  [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19382h/noticed_some_foreshadowing_on_einhorns_desk_while/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sw6s7/maybe_im_late_but_i_just_noticed_and_love_the/), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/p4nqm/my_favourite_lineforeshadowing_in_the_shawshank/)

**What it actually means**: Foreshadowing is a direct hint to the audience about what direction the movie will go in. Foreshadowing must nudge you. Going back and noticing the misty breath in The Sixth Sense isn't foreshadowing

A good explanation from [/u/Clumpy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dt0it/defining_foreshadowing/c9tl12d) - ""At its most basic level
... Shows like Lost really relied on this audience tendency to create depth whether it was actually there

Examples:

Evil music behind a character's entrance is foreshadowing. Someone entering via shadow hints at their motivations.

Foreshadowing can be dialogue ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"" begs us to apply it to the whole story. It can be repetition - seeing oranges around death in The Godfather gives us a pattern. Or it can be semiotics - The box of ""Ka-Boom"" cereal in Kill Bill is pretty distracting - ""why'd they name it Ka-Boom?"" it suggests.

The level of emphasis remains subjective

Here's a [student video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJdXA6zNgqU) examining more excellent core examples of foreshadowing


-------------------------

**Plot Holes**
-

This one might just be lost to the masses since it's so overly misused these days. If that's the case

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Anything unexplained

**What it actually means**: When a movie betrays its own logic.

A great explanation is [here](http://badassdigest.com/2012/10/30/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-plot-holes-and-movie-logic/)

LET'S BE CLEAR - A PLOT HOLE IS NOT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:

A) SOMETHING THAT ONLY SEEMS CONFUSING IN RETROSPECT

B) AN EVENT THAT OCCURS OFF-SCREEN

C) A LOOSE END (THOUGH IT CAN BE)

D) SOMETHING BASED ON AN UNRESEARCHED HISTORICAL ASSUMPTION

E) SOMETHING BASED ON OVER-RESEARCHED HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE

AND F) CONTINUITY ERRORS + PEOPLE JUST PLAIN NOT WATCHING MOVIES AND MISSING INFORMATION

Examples of actual plot holes: From the above article/referencing [this article](http://badassdigest.com/2011/05/05/best-movies-ever-jurassic-park-1993/) regarding Jurassic Park:

""What’s most incredible, and sleight of hand is a magician’s best friend; Spielberg is such a master that even when you’re looking out for these geographical bloopers they barely register.""

Another plothole: At the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, falls through, but [*grabs on and pulls himself up from another wrong letter tile.*](http://youtu.be/9iDeE3mKVfs?t=38s)

Personally I really enjoyed the film. Despite some obvious flaw with any big budget blockbuster the film was solid and visually stunning. 

Was John Carter a victim of harsh critics? or did the lack of advertising (in the UK atleast) kill it? 

EDIT: alot of people seem to hate The casting of Taylor Kitsch as John Carter. If given the chance who would you cast instead?

1370303133.0,1fm77j,The problem with Gone with the Wind being the highest grossing movie of all time...,geekRAT,3810,2103,631,"Gone with the Wind is the highest grossing movie of all time. Adjusted for inflation it has made 3.3 billion dollars. Does this sound familiar? Whenever people bring up big summer movies that make a ton of cash there is always someone who throws this out there and to them I say... that's awesome
   
Gone with the Wind was released in 1939 and its initial run lasted until 1943. It made 221 million its first year in limited release and then 285 million over its next 3 years in general release to bring its initial 4 year total to 506 million globally. Combining those 4 years it sold 60 million tickets. So over four years it sold 60 million tickets and made $506 million in the US. Let's compare that to Iron Man 3 that sold roughly 40 million tickets and made 380 million in its first four weeks in the US or The Avengers that sold 50 million and made 532 million and all of a sudden Gone with the Wind isn't looking all that impressive. So where did the rest of Gone with the Wind's gross come from? That would be the eight re-releases in 1947, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1989, and 1998 which earned the movie its additional 2.8 billion dollars.  
   
So the next time someone throws out how much money Gone with the Wind made keep it mind it took the movie nearly 60 years to reach it’s total. Many of those years took place during a time when alternative entertainment was not as easily accessible as it is today. There was no TV for the first 10 years of the movies run, video games, sports packages, computers, and whatever other endless river of entertainment options we have today.  
   
TLDR – Gone with the Wind made 506 million in its first 4 years and had 8 other re-releases over the span of 60 years to bring its total to 3.3 billion.

At this point I assumed it was a Netflix error

At this point I asked to speak to the supervisor because I didn't want to go back to Reddit and accuse my ISP of throttling without some more facts.

Here is what the supervisor ""William"" at the Netflix location in Denver told me.

1. Netflix just released (a month ago

2. They are having issues with ISPs throttling this stream because it's not really a stream. With the 1080p content

3. The reason Amazon Prime and HBO GO is still working is because they're not requesting as much data.

4. They're having less issues with Instant Netflix streaming on PC because it's based on Silverlight

I asked him if there was anything I could do. He said I could suspend my account with Netflix until the ""heartburn period"" was over with this 1080p upgrade to their streams. He said they're in constant talks with the ISPs to resolve the issue
