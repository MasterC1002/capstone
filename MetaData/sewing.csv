I sew garments, and in the last few years I've fallen in love with machine embroidery and digitizing my own designs. I've been through a lot of machines through the years, some of them great, and some not so good. I've always had to settle and have never been able to buy quite the machine I wanted. 

I left my ""real job"" a couple of years ago and have been able to build up enough sewing and embroidery business to justify investing in a nice new machine. I did all the research, at a price I could afford.

I ordered a Brother DreamWeaver XE (combo sewing embroidery) last week

Nobody I know IRL gets how big a thing this is for me. I've wanted a machine like this for years. It's something I'll use every day for work and for fun. Anyway

CeeCee has to wear diapers.

Patterns were $1.99 and I bought a whole passel of them (Vogue [8807](http://voguepatterns.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Add_3_Full/V8807.jpg), [2787](http://patternvault.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/beyondvintage-octnov2011a.jpg), [2532](http://voguepatterns.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/V2532.jpg), [2401](http://img0.etsystatic.com/003/0/5143912/il_fullxfull.368900724_sw1q.jpg), [1233](http://www.handmadebycarla.com/images/v1233.jpg), [1235](http://voguepatterns.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/V1235.jpg), [1223](http://www.handmadebycarla.com/images/v1223.jpg), Butterick [5711](http://butterick.mccall.com/filebin/images/product_images/Full/B5711.jpg), [1777](http://images.patternreview.com/sewing/patterns/simplicity/1777/1777.jpg)

Half of the patterns are for clothes for me and half are costume patterns that I like to keep around just in case. Costume patterns are pretty pricey, 1 navy blue bottomweight suiting, 1 geometric printed brown chiffon, 1 dark blue organza, 1 shitty maroon satin, 1 [cotton print](http://www.joann.com/april-johnston-project-runway-fabrics-greenwich-caning-stretch-cotton/zprd_11053956a/#tabz), 2 polyester prints) for between 75-95% off.

I'm pretty happy with the whole thing since I just wandered in the place looking for a new zipper I was adding to thrift-store altered skirt I was finishing. Ahhhh yeah!

I have been sewing for less than two years, but many reviews online say the patterns are error-filled, particularly the pattern for this dress.  Thankfully, someone on Amazon wrote a really good review of the book detailing exactly what the problems with this particular pattern are.  Armed with that knowledge, I was able to make the dress, but not without using every curse word I know.  I am most pleased with the results, even though my daughter smeared dayglo pink icing on it that will never ever ever come out:)

Now, and teaching people, or writing things up. So if there are people out there who would be willing to take the info we gather and put it in a form that is easy to follow, that would be great. And if there are those out there who are good at making tutorial videos, those would be very welcome and appreciated.

Any current sewing/costuming/fashion/textile students out there who would be willing to share info/syllabuses/resources (books

I think if we could all get behind this and make a sewing course to put up on the site it would be a huge help to many in the community.

So I guess first we should figure out what people would want to learn

1357266085.0,15xcfk,Pencil skirt sewing experience,clothespin,53,3,16,"Just wanted to share my pencil skirt sewing experience.

[The final product](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#2). It hits 1"" below the knees and has natural waist.

This was my first pencil skirt. I have made some other clothing items (tops, so I did have some sewing experience.

At the beginning of the project I set myself a goal to only use the supplies I already had on hand

Fabric - 100% heavy weight wool. Vintage

I used Gertie's pencil skirt pattern and changed it just a little bit: added a vent instead of a slit in the back

Some details:

Lapped zipper

Bound buttonhole - you can kind of see it at the top of the outside lapped zipper picture. It was my first bound buttonhole; I have been so intimidated by them

[Vent](http://imgur.com/wDgFH&amp;BZoyh&amp;3TSnw#2) - I decided to add a vent, mistakes were made. 

First of all, there was only so much I could do without totally getting rid of the vent. 

Second of all, I ended up with [this](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#4), and you can clearly see my 2 struggle spots. They make me very very angry and I want to kill them. 

[Lining](http://imgur.com/wDgFH&amp;BZoyh&amp;3TSnw#0) and [hem](http://imgur.com/MmUjD&amp;wwhfd&amp;OoA7I&amp;KOcF3&amp;yYbAY&amp;P6lDj#5) - at first I was going to attach the lining hem to the skirt hem, so it is not like you can see a lining when you walk, but I like how the organza ribbon occasionally peaks at you. 

One big mistake I pretty much made - I didn't realize until _after_ I cut the pieces that I was working with a patterned fabric I had to match. The Sewing Gods were kind to me though

Another mistake - I should have lined the belt with something heavier

All in all I am happy with the result! This was my second piece that had a lining

Let me know if you guys have any questions or advice! And I hope this is not too long :s

So, I see a few pictures here of circle skirts and it seems like its easy enough. My mom gave me an old machine and I got it up and running, figured out how to string it (that took a while) and actually got it to sew. After a short while I have the beginnings of a skirt. So when I showed my wife I thought she would be happy to have new clothing, but instead she thought the whole thing was just very, very weird. I guess she expected a more manly pursuit (of which I have many). She was also pissed that I can't fix the basement doorknob but I have time to make a skirt. I'll get around to that knob eventually, I just don't give a shit about that.

I was one of maybe three women that were new and the only one that didn't know anyone there.  

While Connie was wonderful and gave great information

All but one woman didn't even acknowledge my existence.  The leaders were too involved with their personal cliques to even do a greet/welcome.  The only other time anyone really said anything was to rather snootily tell me I was blocking their view.  This was after Connie told us to gather around and the person stayed in her seat

They made the event available as a two day course that you could attend both days

They initially gave me an out dated  packet
I don't want special treatment

I've been to guild meetings for other arts and have never felt so unwelcome. As a chapter event

If you're lucky enough to have a guild that is warm and welcoming

My question is: what's the difference between a $40 one on Amazon and a much more expensive one? I was going to do the duct-tape-t-shirt idea from Pinterest to make the dress form be my size. Is that a good idea?
