So, something intangible for something concrete and really existing. Examples of intangible things are relationships between people/social structures, or sort of 'thought experiment' things we create in our minds to explain concepts (mental constructs, I think is the term?). 

For example, laws of physics, etc, with no desires, goals, or motivations, but sometimes we talk as if it is. Or more specifically, as in 'evolution wants this'

Have I understood that concept properly? 

My confusion then comes from trying to envision other specific examples of this in the real world, Vaneigem, etc. In what ways does reification occur that Debord would be interested in? In what ways does it occur that Marx would be interested in, and why is it such a big deal in these fields? Without real-world examples, it's hard to understand their writing. For example...

&gt; The commodity can be understood in its undistorted essence only when it becomes the universal category of society as a whole. Only in this context does the reification produced by commodity relations assume decisive importance both for the objective evolution of society and for the attitudes that people adopt toward it

-- Gyorgy Lukacs (used as the epigraph to the second part of Society of the Spectacle

What reification does commodity relations assume, and just can't imagine what he might mean. I have a feeling that it's the same thing as commodity fetishism, which is another thing I can't really wrap my brain around... what's being reified in the case of commodity fetishism?

1361041053.0,18ndoj,"""Deleuze and the Meanings of Immanence"" by Christian Kerslake | Paper for ‘After 68’, Jan van Eyck Academy, Maastricht, 16 June, 2009.  (Excerpt re: Marx and Lacan)",14,"&gt;And something odd appears to happen: the
term ‘immanence’ that Deleuze takes as the “secret” of philosophy in his 1968 thesis
on Spinoza now re-appears as realised within the movement of “capital-money” in
advanced systems of capitalism. Immanence disappears as philosophy in order to
return as the form proper to the most advanced capitalist social formations. Deleuze
and Guattari relate this use of the term ‘immanence’ to Marx. 

&gt;In the third volume of
Capital
“Capitalist production constantly strives to overcome these immanent barriers
overcomes them only by means that set up the barriers afresh and on a more powerful
scale. The true barrier to capitalist production is capital itself” (Marx,
Penguin edition
internality of its contradictions as a system
generation of contradictions is essential to its continuation. Deleuze and Guattari are
particularly interested in Marx’s attempt to isolate the internal contradictions of the
capitalist system in Volume III
5
profit to fall (Part Three)

&gt;The tendency of the
rate of profit to fall is the motivation for “set[ting] up the barriers afresh and on a
more powerful scale”: through the shifting of the location of centres of production to
the developing world. But it is the system of credit in capitalism that is Deleuze and
Guattari’s particular focus in the sections on capitalism in Anti-Oedipus. The
immanence that emerges within capitalism is founded on a system of credit and debt
at the heart of the capitalist system. Advanced capitalist social formations unfold on
“an immense deterritorialized flow” constituting “the full body of capital”
instantaneous creative flow that the banks create simultaneously as a debt owing to
themselves

&gt; If capitalism “has realised immanence” it
is because its monetary system “has rendered concrete the abstract as such and has
naturalised the artificial
axiomatic of decoded flows
violent redefinition of the applicability of the notion of immanence has taken place
between 1968-72
the innovations occurring in Lacano-Althusserianism
first of all makes its reappearance as the form of the tendentially all-encompassing
capitalist system that Deleuze and Guattari suggest cannot be explained using
Lacanian logic.

For all anyone knows, the person who created the troll account could be Barrak Obama himself-as ridiculous and unlikely as this claim may be-it is a key assumption that anon's share (whether or not they articulate or accept it).

If I had been active and engaged while the recent drama was unfolding, I have to agree that the point made by georges_perec in a buried comment stands: there really is nothing any anon (mod or otherwise) can *really* do to silence or prosecute another anon who is determined to 'troll' a particular space.

Attempting to ban or remove comments that offend even the majority's personal sensibilities is futile, so to speak) I'd prefer to do one of two things:

1. Engage the troll in active dialogue and critique them in an attempt to better understand or neutralize their inflammatory remarks in an effort to find a common understanding regarding the ostensibly offensive idea; mutual respect for each other as anonymous users, in my opinion in the world at large as well.

2. Barring the effectiveness of option 1, nothing is more effective at shutting down a troll then a lack of feedback and attention.

**EDIT:** For visibility regarding context and rationale for the above proposition:

I certainly don't support or condone the cancerous posts and comments of trolls on this, senseless and toxic. Whatever your subjectivity be (gender, sex, race, creed...) this type of content added only causes harm.

I do however disagree with the primary premise regarding the function of a subreddit moderator. Subreddits abound on reddit with little to no local moderation. They are the majority of active subs, because of the backend protocols of reddit's source code that make reddit tick, a backbone through which we all relay posts, comments and votes, synaptically. It is this hardcoded mechanism that moderates the visibility of content on the site. 

Reddit's sourcecode is designed to take in a lot of information. A lot. All of the time, whatever. This data may be input by any person with access to an internet connection, and it is reddit's operational framework that enables us–the users–to sift through it in such a way that we are able to organize the segmentized content as it appears. Asymmetrical accumulations of data patterns (user, vote and post frequency, duration and lifespan; not to mention karma) then enact a sort of majority governed instinct that generates and translates trending anonymous user's activity and attention into an executive volition which determines what content gets the most visibility and what disappears from the front page. 

Attention is all that matters. Attentionattentionattention! I just made you read that because I already have your attention. ""Attention points"" is another way of saying ""karma"". Users engaged in communication here are all moderated by themselves by default in the reddit operational mode. 

So then, persecutory, vitriolic, punitive and– most importantly–**useless** as those of the tolls they resist (and I'm not singling you out here, because your attitude is diffuse). The last thing most users want is a flamewar and those users who are trolling, I think, are just trying really really *way-to-fucking* (sorry for the language but *obscenely* hard) to make their pain not only heard, all of us

I can feel it, sincere and meaningful users, is the result of what seems to be the very same style of intense and sincere subjective pain and a resolute determination to eliminate it from existence. 

So how to break this cycle? Well if a user is exceptionally sensitive to one particular trolling attitude or another and prone to being triggered by extreme content, every time. This way, if enough do, there will be less traumatization to users already hurt and wounded, by toxic content posted with an intent to hurt, and it will open up a space (in allowing such posts to achieve visibility and keeping the comments in a trolling posts thread free from non-critical inquiries) for other users in /r/criticaltheory who feel safe and/or interested enough to, to actually critically engage with trolling users. 

Such interested critical users might see a trolling attitude on reddit as an opportunity to attempt to neutralize users with discursive trolling positions through critical inquiry intent on incisively exposing any/all assumptions, you might consider this very thread as a sort of useful scalpel for aiding the operation. 

In initial encounters with seasoned trolling users, the greater the chances of one 'getting it,' learning something new about themselves, and others becomes. The accumulation of these users becoming more self-aware and meta-critical, makes that power of that initial, painful conversation intensify and eventually, hopefully, real changes in the position and mind of trolling users or users with ambivalence towards trolling

If the particular trolling position is not substantive

I certainly don't support or condone the cancer that exists all over reddit, dark, obscure, garbled and menacing, but when I feel this in others visualized it in language, I find laguage used to generate critical comments and posts specifically designed to be used for critical inquiry, can function like this sort of sub-atomic virtual scalpel. One instrument for your critical toolkit. That scalpel can be used to help any user take the cancer out of any other trolling user and potential/virgin trolling users to excise cancerous elements within themselves. 

In the initial encounter with a seasoned trolling user, the chances increase exponentially, the more users adopt a similar position. Eventually, that effort, made by those initial users, left in the form of painful critical exchanges between trolling users and the rest of us, may prove to change the mind of some future user whose ambivalence towards trolling might have otherwise become aggravated by their perceived state of critical isolation

It's this accumulation of dialogue from countless users' life experiences, to learn more about myself through others. Hopefully, through continual sharing of interesting, useful content being generated by active, genuine users in cybertextual discursive communities in the form of posts, votes, and comments on reddit that more and more users with eventually find and start to use the discursive critical instruments that are strewn all around. It is my hope that my contributions to the creation of such tools (if conceptual instruments as such can even be said to 'exist') will one day affect good in another in the same way I have been beneficially so.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/189tyq/a_proposition_regarding_the_attitude_of_trolling/

**edit** expanded from comment:

These thoughts are my own and I'm open to any kind of reception or response.

Structural analysis is concerned describing the form and functionality of the various elements present in a given coherent project (a book, by the largest audiences to date. For example, a structural analysis of *Django Unchained* might be interested in how various plot points work, what happens to who, why? When do characters do what they do? Why and who do they do them with? 

Specific questions may ask to any one element, Tarantino makes a German character his tragic hero? Is there anything interesting happening in this relation? How does the selection of music, score, sound track, sound and effects impact the reception of Tarantino films? Is there anything significant about the fact that as writer/director, Tarantino tends to awkwardly appear in his own films?

Content analysis is interested in presenting a persuasive interpretation of a particular, song or idea- like 'democracy'), and substantiating a descriptive analysis with actual evidence from the project itself. For example, a content analysis might consider a topic like, ""The Art and Ethics of Trolling,"" and use /r/criticaltheory as it's text of analysis. 
 
**tldr:** structural analysis is generally interested first in asking 'how' and 'why'. Content analysis is primarily concerned with asking 'what' and 'when' as then seeing 'how' and 'why' and where fit in later.

In order to escape the realism of the structure, which hypostatizes systems of objective relations by converting them into totalities already constituted outside of individual history and group history, it is necessary to pass from the *opus operatum* to the *modus operandi*, from statistical regularity or algebraic structure to the principle of the production of this observed order, and to construct the theory of practice, or, the theory of the mode of generation of practices, of incorporation and objectification.

My question to you guys is relating to the concept of state. I've read around teh history of political-economy quite a bit, what are the relevant institutions, processes and structures that I should keep in mind in theorizing the crisis of the neoliberal state, and resistance to it. 

I've read around the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, systematic theory of the political superstructure under capitalism. Marxists often seem to take the famous passage from the Manifesto (“The modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie”) and treat the state as a monolithic, passive vehicle that is simply the instrument for bourgeois class interest. 

It seems to me that a critical concept of state should be more nuanced than that and take into account the fragmented nature of the state

High Life: Affect and Anonymity in the User Mode of Existence

The crisis of modern life is experienced through various complex relations between anonymous,” (inter)acting though relations simultaneously material (between objects and things) and semiotic (between concepts and discourse), both in the world and online. Affect immanently mediates these processural relations–knowingly or not–and can be traced in, between and across space and time. By following Bruno Latour’s interdisciplinary approach, I intend to interrogate the entropic networks of relations being generated, transformed and exchanged in affective cybercultural capital and in societies and cultures around the world. My inquiry will follow these relations wherever they appear, traversing various domains including my own experiences in online material semiotic discourse and the world. My aim is to determine  to what extent affect or affection (that is,"" “information,"" ""free will,""”and ""power;” and what potential capacities this work is imbuing and enabling in and among the increasingly self-reflexive

That would allow me to discuss the lack of actual gender issues in the show

**Original post:**

Hey /r/criticaltheory. I have a bit of an issue.

We're currently doing a pretty big paper for university

I currently have the following options that I've considered. All of them come with some form of problem for me.

1. **A look at how Community deals with genre.** My initial plan was to look at the paintball-episodes, etc) in the first season to western and sci-fi (primarily Star Wars) in the second season. My main problem here is I have no idea where to start, or even what kind of reading I should actually do. How can I deconstruct and analyse genre in Community in a fulfilling way? Where the f*ck do I even start? This is what I would prefer to do, but I have no idea how to go about it.

2. **A look at gender in Community.** My first idea was to look at the paintball episodes through gender theory, but in general the tone isn't sexual in any way (especially compared to other modern sitcoms, which tend to rely heavily on sex). In short, I have a hard time finding material to work from - even in episodes which presumably are about gender.

3. **Ethnicity.** Again

Community, heavily intertextual, it posists that the viewer is aware of the popular culture references it is constantly making, it tends to deconstruct itself through contradictions (especially the character of Jeff Winger, whose constant speeches tend to contradict themselves while still conveying some form of message the other characters agree with). The character Abed views the world through television, film and other forms of popular culture and often makes comments as the world around him actually *is* a television show (back to being reflexive).

So I'm utterly stumped. I have no idea where to go from here. Either I drop the show and focus on something else, I need to focus on one or two episodes (which is why I chose the paintball episodes, since they have a similar theme).

I hope I make any sense here. I realise that a lot of people here won't have seen the show

So in western magic/metaphysical speak the concept of the corporation is an egregore. I would define the corporation as just the most current form of what I call a ""Trans-historical"" institution. Church

The primary function of a transhistorical institution as I see it, law, divinely sanctioned violence etc). In other words an engine of *doxa*. An interesting question might be is their role in language post, apriori or neither? Why? 50 words or less, be specific.

These transhistorical institutions act as both prisms of language and meaning as well as black holes of language and meaning

This is where the idea of the programming/software realm of language becomes interesting.

Large institutions be they governments, employ software
In their deployment of their sole purpose. For any institution this sole purpose is survival and perpetuation whether that is ""maximize profit"" or ""mass-manage resources"".

So in the past these institutions worked with language on the level of doxa or perhaps a Newtonian schema. But now they function on the level of both doxa and meta/molecular in that they now employ software/programming language as well. (Does this have an effect on the ""grammar"" and semantics of programming language as well like it has on doxa? Again

So my point is that while these articles I linked to (the main one has links to similar essays) may be more loose or ""speculative"" than this community is accustomed to, Deleuze, Marx and definitely Baudrillards reading of capitalisms machinations.

(It is also kind of the gnostic conspiracy theory par excellence.)

Since then I've changed all my passwords, I learned a very valuable  and practical lesson on the very issue that I have been trying to understand abstractly; online, anonymity and vulnerability are two sides of the same coin, and that coin is flipped every instant, with absolutely no certainty whatsoever. No one is ever completely anonymous and anonymity is not some grandiose super-power to taken out of context.

I realize now that basically, some undoubtedly very bored individuals out there thought it would be hilarious to do just that. At first I was furious and full of resentment, but since time has passed I've actually grown thankful for the experience. I was foolish, cavalier and oblivious to the practical nature of a phenomenon that I had too quickly become invested in understanding theoretically. As a result, I elided the practical reality that there are millions of people out there who have used and lived this abstraction for way longer than I have tried to think about it, and that maybe they know things, like how to do things and use the Internet in really advanced and robust ways. That is the lesson I've learned, but especially any philosopher and theoretician interested in understanding how the Internet is changing us and the world we live in

As I repopulate this blog I will migrate and update versions of my old posts as I continue my work on understanding the concept of anonymity and sharing it with anyone who's interested. No more am I under any illusions of my own position as a so-called 'anonymous user' and both in my work and my life I will continue to take care to be respectful to the nuances and complexity of what anonymity consists of and how it affects us as users.

As always

This is the user's creative power. Endless anonymous blurbs written by users across the world as if present and face-to-face are becoming something new. The only meaningful identifying characteristic of each individual being (really) is hidden in a field of static. 

It is the anon's style of use that matters in the din. On the internet, the innate (cap)ability to use. Usually, most words transmitted by anon’s refer to ideas or thoughts which signify deferred meaning which poses as the status quo. Some users (most) tend to perceive these superfluous signs instead of their faint, affective signification.

Others tend to have a greater capacity to perceive affective signification, the only accepted currency is paying attention. Some users with this greater capacity to consistently think differently tend to circulate with anon’s of similar affective capacities, abilities and tendencies. Once these flows begin to stabilize, the already-more-coherent relationality of the assemblage complexifies and destabilizes again. Inevitably, new numbers of outlier anomalies begin to resonate (and become) in similar and even more complex styles. Accrete, repeat. 

In this way, maintaining stabilization, by the greater or lesser concentration of affective users, occasionally articulating a mode of being as such, in the same voice.

Today the modern experience is becoming concretized through the mechanical organization of material semiotic discursive relational processes

The Internet provides disillusioned and alienated moderns access to a new mechanism for experiencing their modern roots which reach back over a half-millennia long process of modernization. These relations in contemporary material semiotic discourse exist in gradients of anonymity. By dint of this field, determined by the perceived anonymity of a given relational experience in relation to the user's actual heterogeneity from the perspective of other circulating networks of rogue or dominating power relations. The effect of such accumulations of the many little choices made by and among vast numbers of users across the world, all the time, is the emergence of a new kind of will power, the force of anonymous user volition.",,False,t5_2tmcb,True

The text I will be working from here is Wlad Godzich’s 1984 translation of Tzvetan Todorov’s critique (Todorov and Julia Kristeva were instrumental in bringing Bakhtin's work into the economy theoretical discourse analysis in France in the mid 1970’s) of work produced as early as 1926 by the “Bakhtin circle, however authorial anonymity may or may not prove to have some bearing on the following analysis. When the “Bakhtin circle” is mentioned it is done as a gestures to all of these individual’s ideas with no specific hierarchy in mind.

The “verbal utterance” as conceived by the Bakhtin circle is an active, consciously or unconsciously implied in and between dialogic exchanges. From this the Bakhtin circle asserts that the meaning of any utterance is related to and contingent upon the meaning of its precursor utterances and their social and historical conditions of expression. The Bakhtin circle uses the term “verbal communication” describe the system(at)ic interpretive economy at work in any dialogic exchange between at least two heterogeneous entities or stylistic utterances relating, albeit anonymously, in and across discursive genres over time.

In Roland Barthes’ 1957 book *Mythologies*, cultural expression and individual thought are conceptualized as communicative messages mediated and spoken by myth. For Barthes, myth is a mode of signification which mediates any uniquely stylistic message conveyed by discourse and “the way in which [myth] utters” always contains traces of mythic data which stick to every message (107). Here, Barthes uses the word ‘utters’ in the Sausserian sense of a speech act, not in the sense of the Bakhtinian conceptualization outlined above. Nonetheless, Barthes’ mythic speech functions like Bakhtin's dialogic principle in that it predicts its reception and implies that no message is ever absolutely originary or a priori to social life. By examining the context of enunciation and reception of messages mediated by myth’s signifying consciousness, Barthes is able to decode concealed meaning and reveal the “social usage” added to any mythic utterance while discounting its substance (108). Barthes uses “semiology” to describe his theory which traces and accesses myth and its hidden modes of its signification that are transmitted through discourse and history in order to understand and describe how its anonymous meaning operates and mediates the individual and social levels of thought and culture.

For Barthes and the Bakhtin circle then, and traditional assumptions. If we can treat a text as a single, as a cohesive expression of a particular author’s message or utterance, then the style, intonation and modes of expression becomes essential to decoding the traces of myth, ideology or genre.
