1370065004.0,1fg9r1,To gamer girls: My thoughts on the comments I received regarding my Portal Bedroom post on /r/gaming,BlondeChell,336,43,40,"I've seen/personally received messages from a few of you that were quite bothered and/or upset by the ""top"" comments that my Portal Bedroom received on the gaming subreddit.

I know a majority of the top comments were rather brainless, or my sex/lack-of-sex life, but those comments were a dime a dozen, and were quite easy to skim over, because there was no actual thought or constructive criticism within them.

Large subreddits will always be at-risk to anonymous groupthink. I can honestly say I will fall asleep tonight (in my portal room!) without dwelling over any of these ""sex-life"" comments (although I will confess some of them WERE pretty hilarious).

What will stick in my head in the long-run, constructive criticisms (the rooms not perfect, I'm always open to learning how I can improve at something!), and the messages from people (guys and girls alike) saying that I did a great job and should be proud of my artistic talent. Interior design, by standards, is not a guy-oriented hobby, so I knew that by posting it in a male-dominated subreddit

I used that subreddit as a tool to present one of my pieces of gaming art (yes, is what spawned from my post:

http://www.cnet.com.au/for-science-the-ultimate-portal-bedroom-339344470.htm

http://blog.gamefreaks.co.nz/post/51825372405/reddit-user-blondechell-has-created-the-ultimate

Hopefully all those links work, inquiries on how I made something specific, or if they could interview me for an article or commission me for a future art project. I received way more of those messages than I did any ""YOU'RE A VIRGIN NECKBEARD O WAIT YOU'RE A HAWT GURL LOLZ I HAS A PENUS!""

There are always going to be people that have something negative to say. Some people still even have the mindset that your gender determines what you can and can't be good at. Don't listen to them

“There’s going to be a thing in your life that you love, it might be reading, it might be fashion design, it might be building things, it might be telling stories or taking pictures. It doesn’t matter what it is…The way you love that, and the way that you find other people who love it too is what makes being a nerd awesome. And don’t ever let anyone tell you that the thing that you love is a thing you can’t love. Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t love that because “that’s for boys,” that you have to love this, and you love them the most that you can!”

We are a subreddit dedicated to females that love the world of video gaming. That bothers some people, there are people out there that try to tear down those that enjoy that hobby, whether it's video games, composing music, fixing cars, knitting, playing sports

I know it can be discouraging as a community to have our interests and hobbies mocked, will remember the encouragement I received from THIS subreddit, my blog, and the multiple websites that linked to my blog saying ""Look at this 'cause this is awesome!"" than I will any ""BEWBZ!"" comment that was posted today.

So whatever passions you have, fanfiction, whatever it is, take it and run with it, and don't let negative criticism or people drag you down, because they aren't the ones worth focusing on.

Game on girls!

I join the party and am instantly greeted with ""Hey! Want to suck my dick?"" I look in the party and there's about five guys in there just screaming things like ""Hey are you a good cook? Cause I need a woman that can cook me a meal and suck my cock"" and repetitive things of that nature. So I start drowning them out and start Filing Complaints on them because I know it's just a matter of time before they kick me from the party and move on to some other girl to do this to. I figure if we can get enough complaints filed they'll get kicked off.

I'm going through ignoring the ""Why aren't you talking? Are you too busy sucking cock to talk to us?"" when it goes a step too far. I hear ""Dude, then let's find out where she lives and rape her and kill her whole family' *annoying laughter* I'm then kicked from the party.

I managed to file a complaint on all of them but was unable to write down their names. They sounded about my age (mid 20's). I just couldn't believe it! I mean I've had my fair share of ""Oh shit

I didn't know any of their names

Trying to cool down a bit and enjoy my game but I'm thinking gaming is a little ruined for me tonight. I just had to share so if any of my other fellow ladies are on XBL and get a party chat from someone you don't know, but this is unacceptable.

TLDR; Received party invite from someone I didn't know

**Edit; Holy cow. Went to bed and woke up to a lot of comments. Thanks for the support team. I'll try and respond to everyone today.**

Except, he didn't give me a second glance. It was as if I wasn't even there.

1372874130.0,1hkwly,I'm a transsexual female gamer. Just joined and am saying hi! Story time!,Lexi_Like_Crazy,190,41,150,"Here is the book I wrote you all. I hope it gets read. &gt;.&lt;;; Validation at the bottom!

Hello everyone! I'm a transsexual 24 year old girl. I've been living full time as a woman in public for a few years now. I've been on estrogen for almost 2.

My testosterone is in female range now

Anyway

""The Surgery"" is one year from now. I'm so excited to finally be content with my physical body. ^_^

Right. So that's me on one level. Here's who I actually am as a person:

I love gaming. I've been gaming since I was little. My first game was the first Sonic the Hedgehog on my Sega Genesis. I am obsessed with Final Fantasy 7. (I recognize it isn't the best in the series but I was a little kid whenI first played it

I always got teased by my friends and other people for my girlishness. I've always been a girly girl since I was old enough to express gender of any degree. I love pink and am bouncy and generally happier than I've ever been. 

Some trans people retain a lot of masculinity during transition. I...haven't. My ""masculinity"" was an act to protect myself. I'm really girly. So please understand I'm not acting like a girl. I'm just being me. Your rules made me feel really comfortable. ^_^

I love meeting people. I'm kind of afraid of competitive online gaming. It's something I used to love but have grown more and more away from. When I was practicing my voice

At first I got called gay. Then I was insulted for being a 12 year old.

When I started getting sexual advances and threats of rape I knew I must be doing pretty good. :P

Honestly in the years Ive been passing and blending in as a woman

It has been eye opening to go from a straight white male to a bisexual female. Giving up that privilege...The instantaneous differences. It was shocking. Even though I've always felt like a girl. The world didn't see me that way. So I had no frame of reference for the difficulties. I've learned a  lot in a short time. I feel like it's made me so much stronger and more capable as a person to overcome things like gender discrimination. To fight through them.

It may be why I have gravitated away from online gaming. The things men say to me online... Jesus. [Sieberella's post is an extreme case but sadly so accurate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hjs79/was_just_invited_to_an_xbox_live_party_where_i/) Anyway...

I don't have a ton of female gamer friends. Males can be so overbearing and competitive. I just want to have fun. My screen name is also my steam id

TL;DR:: I'm a transgirl that loves gaming and had an eye opening transition. Add me at Lexi_Like_Crazy on any platform you have. Steam

I've worked in a gaming store for 4 years

I'm 21 and the only girl where I work. People sometimes have a hard time believing I play games but it usually doesn't extend beyond them being slightly bemused or curious- and they're usually positive when they realise I know my stuff. Because I've worked there for a while most of my customer's are regulars anyway and I've built a good relationship with them over the years.

So today I was busy tidying up the back room for a store visit and I realised that one of the guys on the shopfloor was due to go home. I went to grab him and found him in conversation with a police officer. The guy was clearly bored on patrol (and to be fair

They were stood at the till talking about Lord of the Rings- not sure why

Everyone skipped a beat

I wish I could tell you I nailed him for what he said, but wouldn't get me arrested.

The police officer must have decided I wasn't there anymore and continued to waffle on about LOTR. So I stomped off (and I was wearing my Doc Marten's which made it satisfyingly stompy). About halfway down the store the police man turns round and goes 'Ooops

Now I've dealt with sexism at work before and ignorance plenty of times

This is different

Not angry at her - rather, because dudes like that outnumber me ten to one. 

I'll never stop calling dudes like that on their shit. It's tiring though, and as a result, I treat people how I'd like to be treated. 

Maybe I'm just more naive than I think because I don't understand why that's viewed as a bad thing. Then again

All I really want is my significant other to be free to be herself and get on the other computer and play L4D with me without worrying she's going to be slammed because she doesn't hide her gender.

I talked to him this afternoon and he again said he was sorry and that she's really a nice person and to not take anything she said seriously. Apparently they were fighting earlier that night and she took her frustration out on me and this isn't the first time she's freaked out on one of his girl friends too. I don't really see that as a viable excuse because it was some major BS but whatever.

Anyhow

You can read my responses there

I think I only responded because I was away in a strange country on business and (as I mention there) had recently given a lot of thought on how my gender effects how I am perceived.

I guess my point is that I don't think females who play games *are* asking for anything special. I mean, but I also think that it will take concerted effort to try and counter messages like this. It may fall on deaf ears at first, but maybe one day it will strike a chord and slowly, it will die off.

Sensing her interest, I gave up my controller so that she could play a few matches. When it came time for character selection, I pointed out some of my favorite adorable characters, like Sackboy and Parappa. She turns me down, saying ""I want to play as a girl!"" And so I quickly pointed out Fat Princess, to which she replied ""No, anyway. I know they added Kat and Nariko since then, she was kicking butt! Got 2nd place a few times against some college kids.

I have been gaming my entire life and have been putting up with various comments from the opposite sex. I have no problem dealing with it and ""running with the boys"". But when it comes to streaming, I have cruel viewers, trolling me.



  
These are some of the frequent comments I get:  
• Show me your boobs  
• Girls can't play  
• Go make me a sandwich  
• You look too serious  
• Smile more  



  
Believe it or not, if I am not smiling or looking happy.



  
If you watch any male streamers, it is wrong in the eyes of most men. Can't I just concentrate while I'm playing? Don't get me wrong, I do have fun and laugh and smile with the viewers, but during serious boss fights, I want to focus.



  
This bothers me so much. I feel like there is no way to stop this stereotype. The majority of women are always going to want to look pretty (I know I do). And men are always going to enjoy looking at pretty women and expect it them to be a certain way.

  
Edit: Formatting



Edit #2: First of all, mean and boring I made my stream sound! I really am a happy person. And I do often smile and laugh. It's just the moments when I am truly focusing that I am ""serious"". I do interact with the viewers and actually will take viewers requests (like change a pet that I have in game or change my music). Honestly, I have gotten positive feedback from viewers, saying that I am quite personable and they love how I talk to my viewers. I guess it was just that little thing that has been eating at me. I appreciate all your advice and feedback. :)

**Recap**

So if you were not yet aware that /r/girlgamers hit the front page of reddit yesterday

Yesterday morning

This is not the first time /r/girlgamers has gotten a lot of external attention, the post's karma rating has blown a couple [records.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all)

====================================

**Purpose**

Everything considered, so we can evolve to be more prepared for the next time it happens. 

This event blew our previous unique viewer count [out of the water](http://i.imgur.com/IwqIo.png), the reports of these posts were quite thorough, and in some cases, we mods were able to remove some of them before many users had to read them.

====================================

**Principles**

To recap some of our basic principles, but there is absolutely no trolling, white-knightery or hate speech allowed and we frown very strongly on inflammatory language. In short, you're welcome to make a dissenting opinion, but you need to be prepared for the fact that some people will downvote you for it, and if you use inflammatory language to make that opinion, your post may be removed by the mods. If it is particularly egregious

====================================

**Results**

Following these principles, comment removals/approvals and bans - on this one thread alone. In fact, [this](http://i.imgur.com/abNDB.png) is what the bottom of that thread looks like on my screen (usernames removed from screenshot).

So here are the things I think went well:

1. Users reported offensive comments very quickly.
2. Moderators were able to respond fairly quickly.
3. Our regular subscribers were very helpful in maintaining a healthy discussion
4. We got a lot of attention and gained a lot of fans (subscriber counts will be out in traffic stats tomorrow

Things that didn't go so well:

1. We had no way of notifying regular users that the thread was on the front page (so discussion was starkly different from usual).
2. There was a lot of downvote brigading - in some cases it was warranted (trolls/bigotry/misogyny)

====================================

**Ideas for Improvement**

* One user [suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/10vcm1/thought_you_girls_might_enjoy_this_same_girl_in/c6ha9rr) we devise a method (probably through CSS) of notifying our users if a page is receiving external attention which could potentially change the tone of the discussion compared to what we're used to in our relatively bedroom community. The mods will be working on that for the future.

* Occasionally, another report would be made about that comment. Unfortunately, that is just part of the way reddit's moderation system works, but maybe we could consider making a flair class of some sort that shows the moderators have reviewed a user's comment and approved it. I'm not sure if this is possible on a per-post basis, but I think it'd be useful in large discussions. 

* We need to remind everyone that [reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette) is paramount to healthy discussion. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean you should downvote them. If someone says something offensive that actively disrupts the discussion, they shouldn't be punished for speaking up.

====================================

**Conclusion**

We had a busy day yesterday, because this is going to get more and more common. If you have any ideas or any questions/disagreements for what I've said here, please share them below.

It also has an incredibly delusional reader comment:

&gt; The 'hardcore' gamers are still men, men aren't complaining. The only reason that this is even a story is because the vocal minority have twisted this into a sexism issue (when in fact as the article correctly says that the % of female gamers is increasing).
The sexes are better at different things
Equality is wrong; we should be encouraging everyone to do what they're best at. The outcome for an equal society is: no innovation, no future.

Humans versus Zombies (HvZ) is a usually week long game played on college campuses that is basically a really complicated and involved game of tag. At my university we had missions
	
To try and skip as much unnecessary detail as possible the game had recruited a lot of new players who didn’t all know the rules particularly well and some who just wanted to see how far they could stretch them. My friends and I (all zombies) were staking out a particular group of humans who had broken the rules a few times before now. To keep things simple
	
Here’s where things get stupid. The guy we’d seen cheat went into our student union and began bragging in a public place about his cheating. So he got caught (obviously) and with accounts given by some friends and myself waskicked from the game. So then he went back to where he got overheard and began cussing the game, knowing my work schedule on campus, when I’d be alone at night and how they could make “accidents” happen to me. A person I trusted well was in the room and heard all this and told me the phrase “beat the shit out of” was used.

Obviously my group took action. We went to campus police

This danger seems to be more applicable to women than men and I would like to warn/share with you ladies a personal experience of mine on the topic.

It is really easy to make wonderful friends online who you may consider people whom you can trust. It is only natural that you would want to meet them in real life after playing countless hours of games online together

I once met up with a friend from my clan for the first time. We knew each other online for over a year. We were just friends and I never spoke to him sexually. I considered him a good friend and I trusted him. My friend came to visit and he needed a place to stay for the night because he lived far away. I offered to let him stay at my house. He tried to take advantage of me sexually and when I said ""no"" he got extremely upset and violent. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life

Moral of the story: don't be stupid like I was. Do not put yourself in a dangerous position. When meeting with online friends

If anyone else has similar experiences or other opinions on the topic I'd love to read.

I was running a heroic with my husband with 3 random players from separate realms. It was going just fine everyone seemed to know what they were doing and it was really smooth. We killed a boss and a piece of tanking gear dropped. My husband is a ret pally with a tanking off spec. He checked the current tanks gear and saw that he had a piece similar and of the same item level so he thought it was safe to roll. My husband won the gear and the tank flipped out. He said it was better for him than his current piece and my husband said no problem didn't think you needed it and tried to trade it to him.

Then all three of them started calling him a ninja and saying he was pathetic and worthless and a neck beard and a bunch of hateful stuff. I told them to calm down it was a mistake and he was trying to trade it back and the tank said fuck off and left the group. I was super baffled. We got a new tank and got to the next boss. Then randomly one of them says LOL she must be the ret pallies girl friend. I said I was his wife and all three of them(including the new tank) all started saying horrible things to me. I got called a cunt too many times to count. I was told I was fat and pimply and would never equate to being a true human being. I got told my vagina was fishy as shit and that it has to be covered in yeast because of how pathetic I was. I got called flabby pussy flaps which was the weirdest thing I've ever been called. And then I remembered there was an IGNORE option I've never even had to use it before in my 5 years of playing WoW! We both reported them all for language and opened a ticket. I know I'll never see them again since they're on ignore and on separate servers.

I was just pretty much in shock from this. Most of the time there is literally no special response when people find out I'm a female. There are so many girls that play now especially on my server since it's the known lgbt server I just never find anyone who thinks anything of my gender which I love. This was an incredibly unpleasant situation. I'm not going to go into hiding or change anything about the way I play just because of these guys,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,steam,t3_119cuw

This is the web-definition laid out by wikipedia.


No where does it say that you need to be good at it


No where does it state that you are model.


No where in the definition is there a buxom babe chewing on a controller or covering her breasts or other bits with various gaming instruments 24/7.


I do not see the word ""kitchen"" ANY where in there..


There is nothing stating that you have to be nice and sweet in game OR in real life. 


It does not require an apology for your game of choice. 


It doesn't state a race


You simply require a passion. 


A love for the game.

1355928411.0,153z0f,My worst gaming experiences on XBL have always been instigated by other ladies.,AllyYours,87,20,83,"I am one of the girls who grew up gaming because I idolized my older brother and he played. In order to spend time with him, I am very talented at the gametypes I play

I don't really remember being tested about my gaming prowess, so that could be why the occurrences don't stand out. I am also pretty good at dishing it out as good as I get it. I know lots of you don't support talking shit back to the guys, but there is almost something therapeutic about letting out some of my frustration and stress on douchey guys who try to talk shit to me first. (I am never initially antagonistic; it happens after I get a message like ""Ally is an ugly cunt"" or some guy says ""hurr hurr I bet she's playing on her period"").

And yet, 90% of guys online are indifferent toward my presence or are nice, polite, funny guys. My experiences with females have been completely different. I'd say 50% of girls act like dicks toward me before even getting to know who I am. I've had other girls say ""Well, if she can beat you guys, you know she's a fat no-life"" after I've topped the leaderboad. I've had guys ask for me to send pictures, and upon declining

On three occasions, only to have a shitstorm occur. Each of these times, the offending girl was the ""main girl"" of the friend group that I stumbled upon, something I didn't realize. I love playing with other girls, and two of my best friends on the game are girls. I'm always looking to make more female friends, so I am always friendly toward girls and try (maybe too hard) to be chummy with them. So the guys would invite me to fill up their party if they had a spot. Several times, I would join the party just to see another person instantly leave, and invite someone else. I asked what had happened and they would say, ""They play with another girl?! Awesome, etc' comes our way."" And so it hurt a bit to realize that these girls must have been thinking bad things about me. I'd always reply to these guys

Now I don't know why, saying that I slept around, etc. One girl sent me a message telling me I ruined her life. I asked who she was (I really didn't know) and if I could fix whatever I'd done. She started posting pictures of me on her FB with mean captions. CRAZY shit that just doesn't even compare remotely with the harassment I've experienced from guys on the game. ""Tits or GTFO"" messages seem like nothing in comparison. I'd gladly delete 50 ""I bet you're fat"" messages every DAY than experience one of these ""girl assaults"" again. 

This is definitely not every girl

TL;DR - Guys can be dicks online

My Reddit keyword filters were probably blocking some

So it does look like there's more ""girly"" topics that the user was not interested in. It includes girl power, and some are probably repeating discussions that've already been had, but I don't know where else those topics belong.

Time for more stats.

Okay

The top 7 links of all time are under my ""girly"" category, 7 and 10 months old in that order. I don't know how many subscribers there were then, but links 2 to 7 are more recent. Only #1 is 7 months old, and it's got over 2000 more upvotes.

Everything else up to #25 were also posted less than 7 months ago. (16

I only discovered this subreddit a week or two ago, and I knew I loved this place for sure.

I'd like a history lesson on this place now, people are more interested in ""girly"" topics now than they were 7 months ago when it ~~was~~ appears to be more about ""gaming"" but not in the same way other gaming subreddits are like.

You’re my favourite subreddit (and you, navel-gazing comments about mythology, academia, equality and Buddhist meditation.  Or maybe because I preface almost every comment with ‘mate’.  I’m not nearly as obnoxiously Australian in real life, it’s an internet affectation.

Five months ago

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x46ob/looking_to_recruit_a_female_cis_or_mtf_nonvideo/

It was a curious request for a person – specifically a female person – with no professional videogame experience to hop on board a project to design a videogame.  But not just any videogame.  A game who had multiple female main characters, none of whom were stereotypes.  Being an avid gamer, as many of us are, I was interested and asked the OP to send me a message with more details about the project.  They sent me some additional information, and asked to have a short GChat interview to see if I was serious about the project and what they were looking for.

I agreed – my reasoning was, they weren’t weirdos, wanted me on the project, and were very serious about their philosophy: to involve more people – amateur gamers, artists, etc. – and particularly women in game-making, opening up a somewhat restricted medium to new ideas, and

Six months ago, and we’re releasing it for free, but I feel proud to be involved in making even this small thing in an area I knew nothing about.  And, honestly, it’s all thanks to you, TwoX.

Tonight I had a rather upsetting experience with a fellow female gamer on Xbox Live

The girl joined in, and offered to have me join them. She continuously dropped hints that she was a member of this very subreddit. I'm not the type to feel threatened by another woman's presence when it comes to public games, and so the first round playing with her was a pleasure, and I had every intention of sending her a friend request later on.

It was after this, asking him about his interests and personal life (he claimed it wasn't so obvious), but not acknowledging my presence in the game at all. On more than one occasion she refrained from helping me out (despite me asking her to) and let me die, all because she was preoccupied with my boyfriend.

Later, mainly using them as exclamations which she uttered on several occasions. Being the shy girl that I am, I became very insecure about this and retreated from the conversation.

She bragged about her  gaming accomplishments to my boyfriend (granted, as was I. She then admitted to us that she was well under 18 years old, which was fine, a few of us are underage, including myself (but not my SO, who's in his 20's). She kept joking cutesy-like about how young and helpless she was to be playing with older men (I'm not convinced she was that young, she sounded like an adult to us).

At this point I was barely even talking. It was obvious that I was feeling insecure and shy about the topics of her conversation, and then started singing it to the boys of our party, giggling the whole time (it turned out to be a horrible sexual rap song in which the two biggest contributing words were ""tits"" and ""pussy"").

We later did a little investigating in her achievements list

It upsets me to know that there are women out there whose main goal is to draw attention from men, but I didn't want to give in and quit out, as I was the host.

TL;DR - Xbox girl wouldn't stop flirting with my boyfriend and friend

My questions are: how prominent are girls like this in the community (I'm not new to videogames

I enjoyed the comic and I got the jokes, and I'm already sad that women have to defend their abilities/desire to play games, and that we aren't always considered a marketable audience to make games for (though I'm glad that there are discussions about ""booth babes"" and about ""combat skip"" options because at least if there is talk, there might be progress.) In fact, this is the reason I subscribe to /r/girlgamers, even though I don't contribute much, because I like the reminders that there is a huge community of capable and enthusiastic female gamers out there.  

However, WITH a female contributor.  I try not to get angry on a regular basis, but such obvious exclusion feels pretty terrible- like, REALLY? We couldn't even get ZYNGA?   (And the cat doesn't count!)  It seems like gaming contributors would be more sensitive to these issues and try to be more inclusive.  I personally feel very left out when I look at things like that, like I'm looking into a boy's club with a ""no girls allowed"" sign.

Several months after Anita Sarkeesian's kickstarter ended

Today on r/gaming, it must have nothing to do with the fact that he uses hateful gendered slurs against women. More people stood up to defend the sexist name calling, and he responded back. He lost karma over it. People love to validate their sexism (which is why this subreddit is here in the first place). 

I'm just really happy to have a guy who will stand up and say something when he sees/hears it. It's not easy to challenge the status quo. I think it makes a difference (more so in person rather than online) when a man calls out sexism, but it's easy to dismiss her opinion, since you're being sexist already anyway. When a guy calls him out, it unfortunately may hold some more weight to it, since he's the peer group he's trying to gain credit and validation with in the first place.

1376608650.0,1kgaeb,I have a problem with the way Female and Male androids are depicted in video games and in media.,sashimi_taco,75,13,83,"Something I've noticed with the way androids are depicted in scifi and videos games is that the gender of the android is very relevant to how it is depicted.

I feel as if female andriods are always sexual

* EDI in ME3 was given a sexy model for her android body. It could have been more efficient and better understood. She does actually show intentions of becoming more ""human"". However

* Starcraft's android announcer for the humans is a beautiful woman's semi robotic face. She is of a female form

* In the ghost in the shell anime series


I think that male androids are always seen as something more than that. They are usually the ones being seen as developing humanity. or they are seen as a villain with more of a personality.

* ~~I cannot recall a proper male android in video games. Is this a problem in video games? It could probably be me just not having a big enough library of video games into that sector. I'm sure there are a bunch somewhere.~~ I FORGOT ABOUT HK-47 because i'm and idiot. But he's an example of evil with a personality and is not a sex object (unless you read fanfics)

* TNG's data is ""male"" and he is constantly trying to become more human. That is his ultimate goal in the series. 

* AI's main protagonist is male

* The alien franchise has several male androids. 2 of which are ""evil"" but have values, Wynona. 



I found a video that sort of perfectly explains my feelings on the situation by showing a female android being built

Personally

Yes, unique problems with portrayal in adventure games. But to me that doesn't mean that one should look down on the contribution adventure games have made to the history of gaming: 

- For me adventure games always game across as if they pretty much invented the ""reasonably/practically dressed female (often with a dose of smartass)"" trope

- Connectedly

- For me the first genre that had female Big Name creators. You didn't have to have any special interest or background to know about Roberta Williams. You knew her name because it was plastered across a lot of games you played/loved. 

Here a short selection of female playable characters and heroines in Adventure games: 

- Valanice and Rosella from King's Quest 7

- April from the Longest Journey

- Grace from Gabriel Knight

- Nancy Drew from the Nancy Drew games

- Nico from Broken Sword

- Kate from Syberia

- Nina from Secret Files Tunguska

- Erica from Cognition

- Adrienne from Phantasmagoria

- Thara from the Ankh series

- Laverne from Day of the Tentacle

- Zanthia Legend of Kyrandia Hand of Fate

- Victoria from Still Life

Basically, condescending attitudes and comments towards people who don't share a certain view (not giving them the mutual respect we claim to hold on the sidebar) and a whole lot of preaching to the choir. 

I just feel like it goes against our long-term interests if we're acting this way rather than friendly towards outsiders and those that don't share our views (to my experience

And I also understand that this isn't how literally every member in this subreddit acts; it's just a bit disheartening to see what I feel is an increase in the lowering quality of discussions and comments. I'm not sure if this is just a symptom of our fast growth

I think in the example of the ""Girls Infiltrating Gaming"" article, but we're better than that!).

This isn't the kind of explosion of bad behavior on the scale of some other subreddits (I'm thinking of /r/games in particular)

First of all

I'm sharing a couple of small tidbits for those who may find it interesting:

- The sample was surprisingly diverse
- 74% of participants indicated that they somewhat or strongly agree with the statement

Again

Finally, don't worry about it.  If I'd had the foresight to include a question to indicate sex/gender and kept it as one survey, I would have, but the decision to survey men came later.  I now figure that data on women's experiences in this case may mean little without data on men's experiences to which it can be compared.  If the gentlemen of this subreddit are interested in helping my research, I'd appreciate it tons.

*  [Bisexual women](http://i.imgur.com/mrRHuug.png)
*  [Lesbian women](http://i.imgur.com/adJwVoY.png)

*  [Gay men](http://i.imgur.com/Jhbspjz.png)
*  [Transmen](http://i.imgur.com/CRjJ0FO.png) (Overlaps)

The most prominent result here is that every group mostly plays as their own gender.  This effect is strongest with transwomen (90% choosing female) and weakest with bisexual men (52% choosing male game characters).  What's also interesting is that every female group has a stronger preference than it's equivalent male group (e.g. of straight women 77.3% chose mostly female

When I gave Male Shepard a try I found this distinctly unfun for a number of reasons

When he makes Paragon choices he comes across as a stiff

When I play FemShep I feel like the character is organic; she flows between Paragon and Renegade and still seems like the SAME CHARACTER. Paragon comes across as a character with a high emphasis on military honour rather than a stiff, and the mix is one fluid Character which I can learn and shape as I go along.

Another interesting thing I've noticed is that many FemShep players often feel the same way about her, or ""their"" Shepard, which I have to put down to her more consistent, more organic, more HUMAN character.

It seems like female gamer can only belong in one of two stereotypes. Either ""girls don't play video games!"" and we don't actually exist or

I have seen the latter type more and more. A toy commercial will have two boys racing RC cars when a third pulls ahead and beats them all, but she will be the *best* gamer out of all the characters. Lilah from Ctrl+Alt+Del comes to mind here. Even sites dedicated to real stories from female gamers, like fatuglyorslutty.com, usually feature delicious justice porn stories of women suffering from harassment only to decimate their harasser with their superior gaming skills.

When I first noticed this trope I thought it was a step in the right direction. Girls being good at video games was better than girl being bad at video games, that's probably totally normal. If *everyone* was amazing then all ""amazing"" play would just be average, right? It'd be mathematically impossible for *every* player to have a killer K/D ratio.

But the more I see the dichotomy of ""girls suck at games"" to ""girls are best at games,"" and I know I don't fit into the former category. 

It's so intimidating. I want people to think I'm bad just because I happen to be bad

I want to hear it from you guys since I respect this subreddit a lot. Don't hold anything back at me. There's this one line of thinking of mine that is pretty judgemental

I'll take [Yoko](http://i336.photobucket.com/albums/n340/ShowRender/Render%20by%20ZeeH/Tengen%20Toppa%20Gurren%20Lagann/YokoRitona.png) (Guren Lagann) cosplayers as an example of what happens in my brain. It happens in more cases than this

Yoko as a character, rarely, she plays a part in the battle choreography by being a support sniper while the men do the actual fighting. In most fights she doesn't even get to do that, and she has no plots or character arcs of her own.

Thus I personally don't see anything worth celebrating with a cosplay here. I've done cosplay myself and I don't mean to sound elitist (talk about being a bitch too if I was an elitist cosplayer after having done it only once!)

... unless you wanted people to look at you and find you hot, not by any means, but she does have this one trait in my mind.

He wasn't rude about it or anything and we had a good time talking about the games. 

I decided to look around the store for a while and promptly make my way to the back where all the SNES games are. Another employee follows me and tells me that he saw that I sold Final Fantasy IX and told me how much he loved the game. I agreed and went on a mini-rant about how much I love Vivi.

This exchange really struck me, and I'm not sure I've ever heard a conversation quite like this one before. It's not that I haven't played lots of well-written games, I certainly have. But even the most well-written video games don't tend to have little moments of reflection like this, probably because most video games are written by men for men, and reflection, particularly subtle reflection, isn't a big part of the masculine playbook. We’re supposed to manly men of action, DO! Look at, but there’s nothing like this. Ezio has hours of dialog across three games

Now I don't know for certain that Rhianna Prachett wrote that exchange, but I honestly don’t think it would have happened in a game without so much female participation, both on screen and behind screen. And this in a cross-platform, triple-A title, marketed to everyone!

Also EVERY time I try and talk in vent (though which usually isn't much because I'm insanely shy and don't talk much)  that isn't calling something out while raiding, which gets really annoying because then the conversation immediately shifts focus to me.

But I was playing Alice Madness Returns for the second time this eve (played through it once on Xbox, it also got me thinking about games with feminine leads and/or with femininity as a theme.

I never played the first Alice, most of the women in the district where she is having had to resort to it to survive. 

But Alice is still bold and observant

Even so she gets her powers from cool dresses and weapons like a knife


There are two other games I've countered this argument with as well: Bayonetta and Silent Hill 3.

Bayonetta is all about the weaponizing femininity. Her high heels are guns, lipstick is bullets, accessorizing gives you power ups for certain weapons etc. It's glorious, and it's a hell of a fun game with a great style, a great sense of humor, and fast action gameplay that is smooth as butter to control.

Silent Hill 3, Heather, and every single visual in the game is symbolic of pregnancy, puberty, and other female anxieties and pressures. It's also fun to play, has a great plot (if more straight-forward than other Silent Hill games) and is subversive and scary as hell.

I've heard people give a sort of feminist interpretation of Portal as well given the two big players are both female and the portals are rather, but I'm thinking that was less deliberate...

Can you all think of any other games that wouldn't be the same if the lead wasn't female or is seeped in female themes? ",self,t5_2rfec,False,,all,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hgvuf/femininity_cant_work_in_games/

I love gaming. Video, so I generally play story-driven games and stay away from PvP type deals. As a result, when it comes time for gaming with friends or at lan parties, I can't hold my own and feel like a bad reflection on female gamers as a whole. 



The obvious solution,

A) I don't have time for that. 

B) I game for my own enjoyment



Generally when I express these sentiments or play poorly with others, they included me in the discussion and agreed that some of them were non-competitive gamers as well. It was nice to be treated as just a gamer, not a girl-gamer, but I'd love to have that kind of respect every day. 



Has anyone else experienced this problem? How do you deal with these things aside from demonstrating competitive skill?

Now, and even though she plays better than most of them, she'll still get a lot of shit from these players when the others players die/suck/etc. She's tired of getting matched up with morons and spends a good amount of her time finding a lobby, talking to randoms, finding out they're morons then researching for a new lobby before the match begins. 

She really loves this game, so hopefully I can surprise her with a bunch of new zombie slaying sisters.  So if any of you awesome girl gamers on XBL would like to play some Zombies with her, just let me know in the comments section and I'll relay the info to her. Thanks!

Hey everybody! First post here, ""saddening state of affairs"". I'm trying to find a way to help my girlfriend get past the mindset of ""girls don't play video games,"" so she can actually enjoy some of them.

Let me explain a bit more before anybody jumps down my throat and says, my girlfriend actually can game, enjoys gaming, and can regularly kick my ass-- which I love. However, when she ventures into the bowels of the internet and shops by herself, she's immediately greeted with the swarms of guys who either hate her or hit on her. It's very discouraging for her, and is driving her to start thinking that maybe gaming isn't for her.

I'd like to help out however I can

**Update: 8/26/2012**

So, so now we're planning to open those sessions out to the broader net so she can wade in the wider pool of the net. I've talked to two of our friends, a live in couple that are both pretty avid gamers, to see if they want to party up every once in a while. Once she feels a bit more comfortable with all of us ""there"", she'll see if she's interested in branching off on her own. I've already passed on the information about this sub, as well as all the helpful groups you've all passed on to me.

TL;DR: Playing Dota 2 with friends

So, as we make a decent team together. We get a skype call going and all that good stuff, but our usual 4th and 5th party member can't make it. No big deal, we can just play with random people (who hopefully would be waayyyyy better than us) and have a fun time.

Lolnope. Everything was going fine at first, as I was going solo in mid lane, and couldn't exactly leave. They were at the shop at the time, anyway. 

Creep #1: ""Since you have such a cute voice

By this time, whose community is usually as hostile as a rabid tiger in heat, female or not. Whatever, they bought a courier, all is good, right? 

Think again. At this point I guess they decided that I wasn't able to handle a lane by myself because of my delicate female genitals and started to try and lane with me

Creep #2: ""Why are you running away

At this point they started pretty much following me around the map, and them leaving my friends to die by themselves, by mid-game I was underleveled, the other team was fed, we lost.

When that was over, maybe this time, we could have a legit match. But, as you have probably guessed by now, it's never this simple. The match begins, everyone picks their hero, and we're ready to have a fun time. We decide to wish the other team good luck and get acquainted

Well, and asked us if we could wait 2 minutes. We said sure and paused the game. At this point, Douchenozzle is raging at us and the other team, literally screaming into voice chat. He decides to unpause it, despite the situation. This leads to an unpausing-pausing duel between everyone else and him continually raging. I ask him to stop over voice chat, and he immediately pauses, as if stunned.

DN: ""Who just said that in a girlish voice?""

I facepalmed. The guys start laughing

Me: ""Um

He pauses.

DN: ""I'm just going to ask what we're all thinking. Why are you playing this game?""

Me: ""Because it's fun...?""

DN: ""Girls don't play Dota. It's against the social norms. Why are you playing this?""

He then proceeded to make sexist comments and rage at us for trying to be considerate of the other team. So, saying how ""this is what happens when a girl plays dota"" and how I need to ""go outside and play with makeup like the slut I am"". Despite his general dickishness throughout the entire thing, all of us had a lot of fun just messing around and we even make a few friends. Twas nice.

1350678048.0,11rkpy,Small rant about guild applications and gender,brandnewaquarium,44,11,53,"So I play a LOT of Warcraft.  I'm pretty well ranked on multiple classes because it's a game that I've played since it launched

However, another person in another guild claimed I only received a raid spot because I (sorry for language) ""sucked the raid leader's dick"" (raid leader and I were IRL friends since high school.  I've never even seen his dick, and never will.  I received my spot because I was a dependable healer who worked very hard and knew the class and position I was playing very well.)

I've since moved on from there

So, one of the top ranked guilds in the United States and kind of a media/PR point for much of Warcraft's raiding scene, is one of these - and I happen to know another girl who is close friends with many of the people in there.  She'll remain anonymous, but you kind of can tell where I'm taking this - as has been discussed in this subreddit, misogyny is outdated but overpracticed in gaming but only a small segment of the population seem to realize this.

Anyway, so as I typically do, I began from the top down.  I started out by applying to a guild that happened to have people in my area, because their times and PvP attracted me...

...and ended up not receiving a single response to my application.  I was essentially pocket vetoed

So I applied at the top-ranked guild on my server

Denied.  Female.  Girls don't tank or PvP.  (let's ignore that one of the best rated PvP Druids during I think 2009 happened to be played by a female).

Another guild actually reached out to me around this time, they wanted to recruit me.  At first I felt excited because, hey, a guild wanted me!  They'd seen my theorycrafting and knew I knew my stuff!

Then I did a quick search on them

Anyway, their environment incredibly humble, and my RL friends play on that same server and said that they were a great group to run with.  It's very win-win, and I decided to accept their offer.

But I can't help but comment on the fact that they commented on the fact that I'm female.  I'm choosing to ignore that because I know how women can be.  (Also

And for those wondering:  **each and every one of these guilds had a required question in their application as to what the gender of the applicant was.  Every time I contacted them to see why this was a requirement

I'm sorry, TOO.  I've got a track record of being able to not die, do really well at whatever role I happen to be playing (I am currently a tank/melee DPS, and have previously had very high ratings for PvP), and I've never found myself in the middle of drama I've created or found myself handed stuff because I sent someone a picture of my tits (for the record, no pictures of those currently exist, and any time they ask I send them the link to the Wikipedia article about Blue-footed Boobies).

I'm sorry.  I really just wanted to rant,,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,True
