1352678039.0,1318bc,I want to help you live longer in this game.  So come read these tips you NEED to know.,Tieryal,237,53,33,"I'm on one of my first weekends with this game and it's been a seriously frustrating and bumpy road.
  
  I wanted to make it less shitty for everyone else who has a chance to read this, this shit is long.  Sorry, but I can't get it any shorter.
  
  First off.  I want you to understand that hesitating to kill other players is the fastest way to die.  You can't trust anyone.  I don't care if they have goodies for you, they just want to play with you.  They aren't your friends.  So get the fuck over it and start it off right by putting a bullet in their face and taking their sweet loot.  If you prefer not to do that, just try your best to avoid them.  But if you don't take this advice, don't be surprised when your making a new character and they are laughing maniacally in their global inventory because you're a soft hearted sucker.
  
  Immediate quick tips for improving survivability in this game so you can have some fun.

 * Find a real life friend or long time buddy to play with.  I can't tell you how many times my partner has killed someone while watching my back as I loot stores.
 * Do you need to know where concentrated loot spawns?  [here](http://warz.neon-gaming.de/) Red is high yield
 * Take your time.  Rushing into a situation regardless of how geared you are almost always gets you killed.  Especially when a friend dies.  HE IS DEAD.  Take your time to avenge him instead of rushing into where he died.  I lost an mp5 today to a pistol doing that.
 * GET SOME FUCKIN BINOCULARS (they also stack).  They are probably one of the best items in the game.  Scope out everything before you walk into it.  Peek every corner with them
 * If you want to travel and get to places
 * If you are looking for ways to PvP, logout in a safe place and then login to a high population server.  There will almost always be people there you can kill and get their gear.
 * Clear buildings completely before looting.  People like to hide out in corners and kill you while you aren't looking.
 * Try as HARD as you can to stay off sidewalks and grating.  It makes lots of noise and your position will be given away.
 * [Just because you only have a pistol doesn't mean you're fucked](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731442)
 * [Stay out of Whitestone Mountain](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731085).  It kills you instantly for no reason
 * Look at the tops of buildings before you go into town.  People can currently building jump and get on the roof and shoot really easy.
 * ALWAYS HAVE COVER.  Sprint between cover like trees and when you need to rest prone on the ground under the tree.  The longer you're in the open
 * Use 3rd person to look around corners and over fences.  You can spy on people and they don't even know you're there.
 * To the previous comment.  They can use 3rd person on you
 * Learn what guns sound like what REAL fast.  Take mental note.  Especially to things that can kill you in 1 shot.
 * Not every gun shows in the backs of players.  Like pistols.  Just because a guy has a starting backpack and his hands are empty
 * Try to kill non-priority targets with common ammo if you can do so safely.  If you DO see someone with the small backpack
 * If you hear a shot
 * If you hear a sniper shot or know where one is in the distance I SERIOUSLY suggest switching servers.  You are out gunned completely.  They have you marked dead, or die.
 * The mossberg shotgun can kill someone with m9 helmet and level 2 body armor in 1 shot from medium range.  I've never done it
 * I suggest your weapons should be on automatic if you can do it
 * Anywhere without cover is NOT your friend.
 * If you see someone in the distance it isn't always best to mount up and go attack them, but I didn't want to alert everyone in the area with gun shots.  On top of that, look at how exposed he was.  I could of taken him down with ease.  Even if he was fully geared.  You want to minimize the time you're in that situation.  You will pay for it.
 * Don't try to shoot over the back of police cars and other cars while crouched.  It looks like the shot is going to make it
 * The front window of the white van models isn't a good place to be.  People can see your head perfectly and it's really easy for them to shoot you through it where you don't have the best peek position.  Try to not start fights with that type of cover.
 * When you reload your clip drops on the ground if it has bullets in it.  Make sure you pick it up if you still want it.
 * When you kill other players via gun fights.  Your #1 priority is to secure the area.  NOT LOOT THE BODY.  Take your time, the other covers then you switch if needed (full backpack).  NEVER have everyone loot.  You get shot in the back.
 * Experience is currently capped at 10 (at least I've never seen anything higher).  So don't be afraid to delete your character and start over (you will lose your stats though)
 * There is TONS of action at Clearview and Campos.  ALL of the time.  I've been in 10/40 servers and there is 6 of us in Clearview.
 * Until a change happens.  I suggest healing on 4/5/6.  I do bandages/painkillers/antibiotics.  Double tapping one of those keys uses the item.  6 for firefights
 * If you are playing with multiple friends.  Having one be a scout on the city even if he has no sniper is valuable.  Having him scout targets entering a zone could be critical to surviving.  He might miss out on some action
 * You can access the global inventory by logging out in a safe zone (that one fucking took forever to figure out hahah)
 * If you don't know where your character will spawn I suggest spawning him with nothing and working your way to a safe zone of your choosing then going to global inventory
 * Before you head out.  Have a route planned.  [Something like this](http://i.imgur.com/HsUc7.png).  take note of high danger/traffic areas.  Get used to running the SAME route.  You will know the area well
 * I would suggest staying the fuck out of Campos.  There are tons of hot loot spots and server hopping going on there.  You will most likely die during your stay there.
 * If you're in town or other potential hot spots.  I suggest not using proxy chat AT ALL.  The guy you're chatting with
 * Stay off the roads
 * Turn up your brightness slightly from the games default.  It makes night time easier to see.
 * [Your game model loads before
 * I would stray away from the first 30 servers.  I've seen more cheaters in that shit than I would like to admit.
 * Zombies aggro from much further away when you run.  You can use this to your advantage by pulling a zombie in the open to a place of cover to kill it.  You can do this by tapping run in it's aggro range and it will pull the zombie.
 * If you prone next to a tree and run into it
 * Food is much harder to find than water.  It should always take priority.
 * Things like coke and juice give you some food but also give you drink.
 * If you prone AND crouch you will make no sound. (as in
 * You can loot items through walls.
 * Your team should stick together
 * If you go to cities often, etc.  Have names for them so you can quickly acquire targets.

I've decided to throw this up here (hopefully) as a shining beacon of hope that Sergey and the crew will take this matter to heart and give the game and community what it deserves! Yes I completely understand that in alpha not every system they have developed is in place yet - and they may be working on doing just this! But it never hurts to ""hammer the point home""...

The Warz desperately needs 100% randomized loot spawn/tables per server. Right now we have static loot spawns which promotes:


- Server Hopping
- Constant camping/killing for a single item
- Oversaturation of guns per player
- Reduces need to explore the map


What we need is a code in place that can spawn any item at any of the loot spawns in the game at random intervals. Yes this is a lot more coding work in the back end for the development team

Here is a small example of the ridiculousness of static spawned loot: http://i.imgur.com/kr190.png 
This was done over a 1 hour period across multiple servers. The Rifle spawns in the same spot every hour. Completely unacceptable.

&gt;**##Original content**

WarZ at this point isnt much more than a playable proof of concept, lets just pretend our game is further along than it is, and release an ""alpha"" that people can get in if they pay.
Sure, I mean, just visit their website (Arktos). Hammerpoint doesn't even really exist. The way they are doing things people will either hopefully see the allure of the foundations of what they have thus far and invest further in it (hence now GC is available for purchase, to wit they added 95GC Red Dot Scopes which are pretty awesome), or unfortunately their wording and, well, the public's naivety will lead to bad press along the way.


I was a pretty active member of the community, for defending their own game.
That's when I realized
However I eventually did play DayZ and I did enjoy it quite a bit


WarZ however (and this is entirely subjective) keeps me engaged, even if the gun models and animations need work. I like the attachment system. None of these things were original, however. The attachment system is a blatant copy of Crysis.
But once you get over the fact that these are good ideas, it's easy to see where WarZ could possibly succeed.


And for that, but the future is uncertain.


And for the record, I imagine once the game hits Steam, the statistics will be more visible, and more people will start playing. Hopefully by then they get their shit together and address the hacking situation so that they can take their steam presence in full momentum.

I wish I could be more brief

&gt;**##TL;DR TL;DR TL;DR** 

TL;DR The game is in early development. Yes they have been preaching otherwise, but now they need to catch up to their future-casting of the truth. It will take your support, however: and what is available thus far is very captivating.

    
    
    

&gt;**##Advice about enjoying the game as is.**

*My best advise, stay away from Clearview, Campos, and Norad. There are other places you can visit, and there is plenty of loot there because the hackers/espers arent bothering to loot them. You'll also find other non-hackers like yourself if you wish to pvp, or perhaps group up. Yes, I still get killed by hackers, expect hackers at some point. If you do get in a fight, you will die. An unfortunate trek through a field that is being surveyed by a sniper and you're done.* 


**Consider these factors as you play, because its survival of the fittest, and there is strength in numbers: therefore you are easily identified as the weak.**

Trust no one, let it come to you if it -must-, and know when to cut your loses and run. And frankly, if you come across another loner, take him out and take his things. You will have mixed feelings about this. Welcome to life after the apocalypse.

&gt;**##Comments that you should read.**

**I'm fucking tired of answering [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/14bj55/the_truth_about_war_z_and_how_to_cope_with_it/c7cfzil).**

 I'm linking to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/14bj55/the_truth_about_war_z_and_how_to_cope_with_it/c7blj5x) just in case it gets lost beneath other comments because it's also something I am very keen about.

[This conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/14bj55/the_truth_about_war_z_and_how_to_cope_with_it/c7bloi6) is rather good at getting to the heart of the issue, and the points raised are pretty good, on both sides.

&gt;**##Unnecessary and unrelated rant about DayZ.**

*Update: I really shouldn't add this commentary, the two games exist as separate entities to me due to their significant differences in execution, but ugh. Walking around feels like Trespasser. I'm stuck in a door frame because of my pistol, and I cant lower my pistol the way I can a rifle. The melee weapon needs to be reloaded? Also the way zombies run at you it makes using the hatched rather hit and miss. The range for zombies to do damage and your melee range are both rather far. What good is the trembling if it doesnt affect your aim in 3rd person? And why do zombies go through walls? Why cant I barricade myself inside a building? I have to stop running in order to hop over a 3foot fence that zombies can just run through? I tried to make a camp fire on top of a building and it bloody disappeared. I figured it couldnt spawn on the buildings and was probably on the first floor but I couldnt find it. And for the love of god, why do I go from 60 fps when in a field to half that if I stare into a bush?*

Anyway, unoptimized, and clumsy. I'm just putting that out there since so many people are so quick to mention the same things in WarZ.

I was actually left kind of disappointed, but they need those damn features and anti hack. I dont have faith in the Arma engine, but the DayZ designers do seem to know what they're doing. I have high hopes for the standalone. As is its like voting Democrat or Republican, the lesser of two evils. =/

&gt;**##Unnecessary but somewhat related rant about WarZ.**

*Rant rant rant:* And while I'm on my soapbox, so this affects me as much as anyone else, but I hate the fact that from far away, other players stick out like a sore thumb. It seems the further you are from someone the more of an advantage you have over them, in terms of spotting. And that's a big advantage in this game. If I cant render grass on that hill, I shouldnt be able to render player models either. This concerns me constantly as I prone in a field while typing or changing equipment or even if I'm being dastardly and want to surprise a group coming in my direction. Knowing that from far, they just see some dumb ass sitting atop a flat plane, then it occurs to me that from Clearview

**TL;DR** This is probably about as un-biased an accounting as you're gonna get anywhere.



**PROS:**

* DayZ style gameplay

* Relatively few bugs

* Pretty good server uptime

* Easy to install retail client

* No queues or wait times

* Customizable weapon attachment system(a near direct copy of the  Crysis attachment system)

* Clan system with in-game visual indicators for clanmates(this is a huge benefit in squad play)

* Multiple character models with selectable face and clothing styles


* The hacks in WarZ are less severe than in DayZ. WarZ hacks seem to be limited to aimbots, no-spread, and no-clipping. There are apparently no thunderdomes, teleporting(anymore), nukes, godmode, item spawns

* Private game server rentals are planned with both PVP and PVE settings available.

* Private ""stronghold"" server rentals are planned. These are similar to instanced player housing in MMOs

* Many planned upcoming features and content incl. skill trees, crafting etc.

**CONS:**

* ""Hackers"" while less disruptive

* Gameplay is currently limited to 1. Item scavenging 2. open world PVP 3. Open world PVE(zombie killing)

* Target dates for content and feature delivery have been repeatedly pushed back.

* Certain planned and discussed features incl. Bounty System have disappeared from the planned feature updates with no comment from the devs despite questions from the community

* Relatively ineffectual anti-hack systems. 

* Clan invites over the initial 20 actually cost real life money.(the devs mentioned a plan to allow people to earn cash shop currency in-game

* Clan invites are not account wide

* Only one map to play on. No new map planned for approx. 6mo. (current map is at most(see edits) 1/5 the size of the DayZ map Chernarus)

* The devs have stated that whitelists are not planned for private servers. Since the WarZ anti-hack measures are spotty at best

**AMBIGUOUS:**

* Permanent item storage

* Less focus on survival as a meta game

* No hunting of animals/cooking system

* Zombie AI is easily circumvented by players of moderate skill level

* PVP focus - All public servers are PVP flagged

* Limited fresh spawn protections

* The rarest and most desirable items are so rare as to be essentially non-existent. Don't think of item rarity as a bell curve

* Lack of a meaningful alignment system. (Devs have indicated in the past that this would be improved

* Lack of a mathematically realistic mildot system

* Limited Pay 2 Win - ammo

I run around with a small group of gamers in various games spanning multiple genre with one key aspect in mind

I led the charge into WarZ for one simple reason

**Comparison between WarZ and DayZ**

before I continue I will state that as a community we will be playing both titles

**Map**

The direction each game has taken is most diffrent here. Day Z has a much larger more open and accesible map

The WarZ's map is more themepark than open

Each map style puts people into choke points

**Movement**

first thing you may notice if you played DayZ is that movement in WarZ is slower but also you move virtually silently (unless in buildings). this enables people to sneak up on others much more effectivly than in DayZ. Controlled are simpler in WarZ which has its ups and downs

**Loot**

WarZ annoyed me at first with this

At first you will be storing every hammer you find and every booney hat, mask, backpack and ammo.

Its at this point people will be saying ""if you can just spawn fully geared what the hell is the point?"" and my reply is maintaining that pool of loot is the source of enjoyment for me in WarZ. I have a mad 20-30 mins of killing sprees sniping people and taking control of an area or location then when I've died a few times I re-gear for maximum loot whoring (larger backpack

In DayZ

**Combat**

PvP is fun in both games

We have all agreed (the guys I play with) that DayZ squad action is more intensive with its spotting, tracking and massive travel times and feels more ""pro gaming"" than WarZ.

Having said that we also really like pvp in WarZ

**Input/Output**

As hit on above

**So Why will you play both?**

",37,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/15j3pe/open_letter_from_hammerpoint_interactive_to_the/,"Just got this email from the Hammerpoint Dev's - VERY Interesting.

Dear fellow Survivors

 

It has now been more than two months since we launched public access to The War Z. We’ve definitely had our ups and downs, how we have addressed that and what our plans are.

 

First of all a very big and sincere “Thank You!” to all of you. We are really proud of the community we have formed with you guys. Every day we have hundreds of thousands of players on our servers, I need to admit that we failed to effectively communicate some of our plans and actions to both our existing players and to our new prospective players. This failure to communicate resulted in some very negative feedback from some members of our community, but while it might be easy to label them as “haters” or some other dismissive term, in all honesty this is my fault.  I became arrogant and blinded by the early success and quick growth of The War Z, our increasing number of players, numbers we were getting from surveys, etc., instead of addressing small things first and staying focused on the game issues. At the end my arrogance led us to the moment

 

I do not take this situation lightly, but we can’t change the past. The only thing we can do is to be sure that we won’t repeat the same mistakes in the future. I have realized that as the leader of this ship, I missed all early warnings that were saying, “Your community is not as happy as you think they are, you need to alter course.” I was too focused on how great we are and how a small independent team got their first game to over 700,000 users in a two-month period.  Though that is something to be very proud of, allowing that to overshadow the existing community and their satisfaction was poor judgment.  

 

I want to give you some insight into what our plans are for the future

 

**Community management and moderation – the problem**

Even since the early Alpha launch, we weren’t prepared for this large success and the way we managed the community was not the way it should’ve been. We relied too much on forum moderators, whose primary role was to punish those who break rules, not to engage the community and guide conversations into productive discussions about problems. There wasn’t enough presence of the development team on forums, there wasn’t enough updates on development of UPCOMING features. We failed to communicate our position and messaging on the outside platforms such as Facebook, twitter and various online websites, and when we did this we chose to rely more on arrogance rather than being humble and trying to understand why people were saying negative things. We chose to tune out negative reactions to the game, again, in hindsight – those things probably work well for more casual games

 

**Community management and moderation – the solution!**

We’re changing our community management procedures and rules right now. We’re going to reevaluate publishing and marketing team performance, check out what we’re doing, and share with actual developers their concerns, wishes and thoughts on the game. We also will involve community, to a much higher degree, in the process of making our next map for the War Z (called “California”). We’ll be discussing many of the aspects of the map with you and asking for feedback.

 

We’re revisiting our forum policies; we’re going to bring on an additional community management team, etc. But we’ll make sure that every opinion is heard. At the same time, I must also be cautious: we cannot address all issues and there cannot be only one voice. Please accept that. With hundreds of thousands of players playing, talking, chatting, voicing their strong opinions, there will always be diverging opinions. And some issues that are minor ones are sometimes brought to light by very vocal channels. I would even say there is sometimes a beginning of controversy because the game is now so popular. So there is sometimes a distortion between the severity of the issue and the attention it gets. But we will clearly implement steps to better listen to the community.  

 

 

**What is Foundation Release?**

The most asked question of the last week was “is this the final release?”  My answer has always been that for an online game a “final” release means that the game is dead – so there’s really no such thing, 2012 as our first-stage release that we use as a foundation to build upon. It does include the core features and a fully playable environment. This is our version 1.0, and of course  we will continue to improve that version as time goes on.  Did we rush to get it done? That is a tough question, but to answer honestly I think that we all pushed very hard to be first to market and in time for the holidays. Our entire team was working late, long hours to iron out issues and include as many features as possible.  This is part of the reality of being a smaller, independent game developer. If we had a larger team and more funding we may have done things differently, but I’m not sure. I don’t think it was a mistake because our numbers have been strong since day one and, our metrics are really solid and we’ve been continuing to grow.  The negative opinions are always the most vocal

 

**What’s on the Horizon?**

As for what will happen next with The War Z? We’re currently evaluating the relationship between Hammerpoint and OP Productions.  I firmly believe that Hammerpoint should be playing a more prominent role in publishing/game operating process. We’re in a process of adding new key members to our team

 

I know that to some people my words won’t matter much. I understand that. I hope that will change as we move forward and deliver the features that our players have been waiting for. I can promise you that from now on things will be much more transparent

 

I do believe that we aren’t even close to uncovering the true potential for The War Z

 

Thank you for reading all this

 

I hope you are all having a happy holiday and I wish you the best for the New Year!

 

Sincerely

 

Sergey Titov

Executive Producer



**TL:DR - We know we've been less than stellar in the past at listening to growing community concerns but we're bringing on some experienced personnel to help us grow the game. Above all trust us to do better at listening to your concerns in the future.**

I was completely new to the Zombie survival game; barely sinking my teeth into this small

From the start, and the [epic looking scenes](http://thewarz.com/pic/War-Z_S04.jpg). When I first played, I was filled with so much excitement that, even after 10-15 hours of gameplay, I still looked passed the fact that, I still hadn't seen anything CLOSE to what the site and pictures painted the War Z to be. Digging past all the bugs/hacks/glitching I've been through, I told myself it would get better. I've had my fun with War Z

This game, tell me I'm just some mad kid, but this has creditable insight on whats going on in War Z. The duping is back, it's estimated over **[15 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Y2WHtvK6rso#t=656s)** USD worth of items has been injected into the games economy through duping, and tens of thousands of rare weapons injected into the game as well.

For months *still* I sit here, its probably never going to happen. This game has SO much potential, but every chance Sergey has at turning this game around, he digs its grave even deeper. Its estimated that he has made over 10 million dollars from this game... If you were to tell people this was a 10 million dollar game, they would stare at you like you were a complete idiot. I've given this game so much of my trust, I've told my closest friends that this game is amazing, and its worth their money. I now completely regret saying anything to my friends about WarZ, I'm a bit ashamed. I was the person who stood up for this game. I was the person who said ""They're making mistakes I know

I want to make myself clear, that I myself have picked up Day Z, and find that game much more suited to how **I** would like a game like these two, to be. 

With all that being said, that wasn't that case at all. I really wish the best for War Z, but I'm not keeping my hopes up. As for me, I'm done with this game, and everything revolving around it.

I wish the best of luck to everyone.

We're more than aware of the server debate. While I can't say specifically what we're deciding to do in terms of private vs. public servers, just so we can see the ramifications.

1364931434.0,1bja8x,Current State of War Z,wolfnwolf,61,16,52,"Firstly, I do understand the game development pipeline fairly well.  I've worked with several teams

I want to start off by offering my answer to a question many of us are asking.  Will the game be improved/updated?  This is a though question to answer, the company has proven itself to be very unorganized, unprofessional, and inefficient.  In the past, I've talked with many 3D Freelance Artists who all created fantastic 3D Environments, Props, and Characters.  This included budgeting, that a map similar to the current War Z map could be created for less than $10, props, but create more maps.  There is literally no reason why all buildings should not be fully enter-able with each floor accessible.   Currently

With that, and do not properly know how to move forward with the games development.  In my opinion, if they can't get their shit together soon and use that money wisely and release a massive update with a new map, content, and features, they should hand the game over to another company.  Sell it to a company who can do something with it.  Right now I would place the odds at 50/50.  There is a chance they'll move forward, release the California map, new features and content.  But only if they invest their money wisely into development - remember - we should of seen this by now - at least some of it.  To date, Hammerpoint

I'm not bashing War Z, we should have already seen big map improvements (not just more origin crates and vines).  We should have seen cars, and new features.  I mean think about adding vehicles - you add a couple models and a driving control system.  It's extremely simple.  With that kind of money, anything should be simple.  But with Hammerpoint, at least to date it's anything but simple - and I don't get it.  

So Hammerpoint, by spending our money wisely, and release REAL UPDATES, FEATURES, CONTENT.  Get a new anti-hack system that actually works.  We want to play your game without the headaches, we want to see the game succeed and grow as it should have.  We don't want to wait around for very minor, uninteresting updates which should have been done under the radar.  &amp; Why the heck can't you communicate with your player base and tell us what is going on, if any.  I don't want to see another Dev Diary about a feature that was supposed to be implemented at the games release.  I want to see the next Dev Diary about War Z 2.0 - A major release that makes sense and allows us to go ""OH That's where my money went"".  Prove us wrong. Prove to us that the money didn't go to pockets, and meaningless shit that none of us care about.

The whole point of this post is to really bring to light to everyone that there ARE hackers and there are more than many people think. There are some steps to take to get these players banned for good.

Here they are:

* Take screen shots of people doing hackish type things or wall glitching

* If your computer can record while playing this game

* This one is important as it goes with the two points above; you want them to type to you. Engage them. Get them to admit it

* Videos and screen shots aren't enough to get someone banned, and have them look into it. That's about as much as you can do.

One last note, we'll give them one.

We are the ones testing this game, players can do there part too.

*Edit: this is in the comments but it should have been in OP.*

Also

* WarZ releases

* WarZ hack is developed and released

* WarZ Dev's patch it so it crashes when you inject the cheat (They actually did this)

* WarZ hack patches and fixes it

* Screenshot catcher is added

&gt;sergeytitov: hi guys and girls !

&gt;Just want to give you short update on what's going on with War Z and what to expect from the game between October 15th and October 31st. 

&gt;Lets start with where we're right now. Today we finally merged code between two dev branches and fixed our most notorious bug - zombies being stuck. Thing is that this bug was like our nemesis for quite some time - it cam and go, and additionally fixed bug that allowed some zombies pass thru barricades. No more . Also new system allowed us to spawn way more zombies, so now cities became really really dangerous places to visit. 

&gt;We reworked zombie combat, unless you have lots of stamina and willing to sprint for some time. Or you're super lucky son of the bitch and have lots of ammo and guns. Even in this case I'll run 


&gt;So next thing is October 15th launch. In preparation to launch we'll upload game client to our CDN. As you know you'll need to download game launcher ( aropund 5mb ) from link you've got in email recept. Actually anybody will be able to download this launcher - so there's no need to enter any passwords, usenet, other sites helping more people to get it faster. 

&gt;Once you'll install it and launch you'll need to validate your serial by providing your serial number and e-mail used to order game. After that you'll create your account password and you'll be ready to go. Launcher will update game to most current version

&gt;We'll have several hundreds servers available with more on standby. We're going to RESTRICT you to only part of the map - approximately 30%, performance, iron out bugs, etc. Trust me there's still shit load of places to explore for first week 

&gt;Since we're limiting access to map area

&gt;Our goal for Alpha is to fine tune item spawns,,False,self,t5_2ujwe,False,,True

I think he's still around on a new handle. There was supposedly drama surrounding him while he was a mod for /r/DayZ before he was kicked. I don't know much about that. Hopefully now he will just keep away from moderating subreddits. He's a cool guy he just doesn't know how to keep a filter on.

The way I see it there is one of three ways this subreddit could go:

1. *Remain a Spidey subreddit i.e. stay unmoderated.* Continue posting your spiderman memes

2. *Post anything as long as it's about TheWarZ.* ANYTHING about TheWarZ that includes controversies, reviews, etc.

3. *Only allow content strictly about the game itself.* This means no controversies. This subreddit will be strictly about the game i.e. tips, etc. It appears since the orange screen went up two new subreddits designed to meet this goal were created: /r/warz and /r/theofficialwarz. Perhaps they can combine to become strictly about the game and then this subreddit can be for anything including controversies.

I'm personally in favor of option 2. It's amusing to find out what the new WarZ controversy of the day is. Unfortunately these things continue to happen. It's hard to continue supporting this game with all the bad PR but I still have some faith. I think it's possible for them to redeem themselves after all this.

Anyway

So voice your opinions/concerns

edit 01/08/12. fixed grammar

Update 01/08/12. The majority of you appear to want Option 2 so we're going with that. Option 1 was obviously never a real option but it was provided for laughs. If there comes a time when there are less shady activities going on and the controveries die then this subreddit will naturally shift towards Option 3.",self,t5_2ujwe,1357626805.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/157604/the_future_of_the_spidey_i_mean_thewarz_subreddit/

Well we end up running into these bandits.  They take two of us out before we realize what's going on.  The other folks in my group get into a big firefight with them. They take one or two down, ran to a better vantage point, then came back to our server and again got the jump on us.  Took another one of us down, but we finished all but one of them off and that person ran to the safe zone and logged.  

This sort of behavior is not only cheese factor 10

A couple of ideas I had were either:  

A) A server timer

B) Make it so you can only swap servers if you log out inside of a safe zone.  While that would be a bit more extreme

In my experience, not a mortician. I woke about a quarter mile from the edge of town and broke camp. I was out of supplies



The police station was empty, but I really could have gone for something to eat. Maybe in the -- fuck, what was that? I turned my head to see some idiot with a flashlight charging towards me, tailed by a handful of Zeds. One of the distant deadheads perked up at the commotion, and blankly stared my way. Shit. I dove out the pigpen's open window and made a break for it, rotting corpse in tow. Maybe I can lose him behind the motorhome? Nope. By cutting across an abandoned house's yard? Fuck all. Run. Run. RUN. 



Nearly out of breath, hugging the building's wall, listening for signs of life. If he's still in there, he could easily bludgeon me to death with that maglight of his -- if he's not, I could be eating breakfast. I laid down to conceal my position and consider my options. Suddenly my eyes came into focus on an assault rifle, hidden under the bulk of a overturned police vehicle. Bam. Leverage. New weapon in hand, I slowly crept around to the station's side door, dropping my breakfast and his damned flashlight on the way. Murder for a granola bar and a gulp of water. I didn't used to be this guy, and I take them down with what's left of my ammo. The rifle is spent



I decided to check out the fire station after breakfast -- they could have some leftover medical supplies. I think I saw it over where I climbed those boxes. I peeked out the window -- the Zed had wandered off



The firestation was empty, water, and of all things, a handgun. I pocket the grub and check out the gun. 13 rounds. Not bad. 



POP POP



FUCK. I back against the wall. Someone's shooting at me. Damn Karma. Hugging the brick I pop out and get a couple shots off. A woman. I'm pretty sure I nicked her, gently squeezing the trigger as I see her approach. She's down. Shit. This is getting dangerous. 



I pick up the pieces and score a mossburg, it's out of ammo. My pack overflowing with weaponry, I run across the street, looking for food and cover. I can hear gunshots ahead of me, but soldier on. Nothing behind me to scavenge, may as well, right? I can't find the source of the shots



I dash across a parking lot and an empty yard



I skirt around the edge of a fence, the shot echos across the surface of the lake. One down. Five shots left. POW. Again and again. I take a few hits reloading. Another Zed takes notice. Fuckity shit, man. My last shell expires, and I throw the gun to the ground, sprinting through the fence with the last of my breath, ducking into the mechanic's old garage. I think I lost them. I look in my pack to see what's left -- almost nothing, and I'm out of ammo.




I look up to hear a slow groan as three more Zombies approach. Completely out of breath and bleeding out



Maybe I should have given that fella in the police station the benefit of the doubt.

Table of Contents:

Section 1................................................Tiers of Loot

Section 2......................................Locations on the map

Section 3............................................Needed Supplies

Section 4............................................looting methods

Section 5...............................................Loot Recovery

Section 6.........................................Muling and Banking 

Section 7....................................Zombie and XP farming


**Introduction**
      Hi! I've been playing Infestation for about 7 months now and along the way I've picked up some tricks I figured I could share with the community. This guide will be focused on looting highly dangerous zones that contain lots of zombies to accompany the better loot they hold. 



**1.) Tiers of Loot**

4 relevant tiers of loot appear at these military locations, military apparel and military scout spawns. 

**2.) Locations on the map**

The following locations spawn high grade loot as seen in section 1:

*Norad Military Base*

*Ridgeway airport* 

*Camp splinter*

*Campos City* 

*Boulder City*

*West Boulder Meteorological station* 

Each location has a unique mix of spawns, while it has a fraction of the amount of spawns that can be found at the further locations. Boulder has a nice mix of food, meds, and civilian weapons as well as tons of ammo, yet you have a lot of ground to cover to check all the spawn points. 




**3.) Needed Supplies**

Before you embark to go loot you need a couple of items to ensure maximum proficiency and safety in your loot runs.

-1 personal Locker

-2 Vaccines

-Some Water

-A handful of meds

-A melee (Preferably a 2 hit like a Hatchet or Katana. )

-Large back pack or bigger

-Binoculars (Optional)


**4.) looting methods**

 Now that you know where to go and what to bring, you can travel the map with your box serving as a safe haven to kill zombies from. there are only two ways to be completely safe from zombies while swinging on them, a gap (Even then they can swing on you sometimes,) or a lockbox. Place your lockbox and swing on the surrounding zombies with your melee until you've disposed of the undead.

Agro the zombies: http://i.imgur.com/JqWWlOG.jpg

Quickly place your box and jump on top of it: http://i.imgur.com/kO6QskD.jpg

Swing until they are all dead: http://i.imgur.com/YkdGYL7.jpg

Get your money! http://i.imgur.com/qNH9wCv.jpg

Side Tip: Check zombie bodies for ammo.

Binoculars can be used while in third person to loot from even longer distances. Going into third person and zooming give your longer item reach


**5.) Loot Recovery**

Whenever possible be ready with another character to recover your items

**6.) Muling and Banking** 

When your all full bring your loot back to the Safe Zone


I hope this helped! Enjoy

You'll be here in no time:

1369792061.0,1f8oi8,Fed up with the lack of development and action against hackers,BankableChicken,36,13,77,"Please bare with me while I rant.

I'm a pre-alpha player that decided to pay the $50 for the legendary package to support this company and development team on what could have been such a great game. If you read a more recent comment of mine in another thread on this subreddit

What really is grinding my gears now, or getting other things implemented in this game? Dude. stop playing the fucking game and fix it for the rest of us.

I just read a ""pre-patch notes"" for this week, and acquired a degree in exactly that myself, the lack of progress and development on this game is ridiculous. I'm beginning to believe more and more the guys that said this was a cash-grab from the beginning.

Furthermore, tell us, its better than lying to us. And kewk, knowing you frequent this subreddit and will read this, more than half your community knows your full of shit at this point. You have a great game with great potential on your hands and you're throwing it down the toilet.

Your legit players (which at this point, just put a decent anti-cheat on this game, work on fixing your current map instead of developing a new one, and communicate with your community just a little bit more. It would not take much to make this game the all-star on the market, even after DayZ SA is released, but you have to care at least a little bit. So much potential in this game, and so little initiative to make it happen

To any and all of you FEW legit players still out there - do yourself a favor and take a break and/or quit until a definitive anti-cheat has been added. Its what I did

Also

EDIT: i would like to point out that I just checked, I'm willing to bet real money that less than 10 of these players in the top 100 are legit.

While I do not actively camp spawns or safe zones

Survival.

This is the entire point of the game. Find enough food and water to survive is the only goal. My only goal. And if you are between me and that goal, I am essentially letting them steal from me, and ain't nobody got time for that. That player could also head down to that city, find a hammer, and come back to hunt me down, which is a risk I am not willing to take. (It is even riskier to let new spawns survive as of the 10/23 patch, because they can spawn in with weapons in their inventory.) If I see a player coming from or going to a safe zone

Now I know that there are spawn and safe zone campers

Sure I might kill a new spawn, but there is no way to differentiate between spawning and getting killed by 2 different players, or just 1 camper. Not knowing who killed you is a huge reason why people are making these outrageous claims.

I have played the alpha nearly everyday since release

Anyway, and if you are not willing to do what it takes to survive, then you will be dead. You could essentially win the game by creating a character and never logging on to a server giving you a 100% survival rate. Is that the kind of game you want carebears?

The roaming zombie swarms are basically a large group of zombies

What it can do for WarZ: 

- A sort of dynamic event to watch out for while discovering the map.

- Strategy could form around.

- Once settlements are included
and equip themselves accordingly. 

- Perhaps

- Allow for some co-operation between players to bring the swarm down (it would probably have a decent re-spawn time)

- If not well implemented

I got tired of all the downvote selfishness on the WarZ Guest Pass subreddit so I just got a trial key from the IGN Prime promo. I Just played my first ~20 minutes of WarZ:


Spawns me in the middle of the woods, I peek around the corner and see a shiny new M16 just lying on the ground, waiting for me to loot it. As I inch my way toward it, it disappears. I start to back-peddle like a mad man, and duck back around the corner. I hear footsteps and see another survivor poke his head out the grocery store door and then go back inside. A few seconds later gunshots are fired. Did the survivor meet his death? Was it a zombie attack or another survivor got the best of him? I start to panic and sneak around the other side of the building, checking out the abandoned store next to the grocery; nothing of interest in there. I head back to the grocery, thinking that maybe the survivor just got bested by the local zombies inside, you drop all your gear). I peek inside and it looks clear, but I can't help but feel like I was bait and switched. I'm dead and have to start all over




Right after that death I made a new guy and managed to kill a dozen zombies and snag a large backpack, and some helmets/masks and stash most of it (minus the large backpack...sadface) in my global inventory before being gunned down as I was scavenging a house in the NW outskirts of the map. 



Before playing The WarZ I was struggling with the fact that *yeah* they may be ripping off DayZ, I'm having fun and the people who are working on the game seem very intent on making sure it's the best game they can make it be. Whether or not it was actually conceptualized before or after DayZ is moot to me because the bottom line is that it's a concept and game framework that **works** and most of all is **fun as hell** and they have executed it well enough to allow me to look past all the drama and speculation.

Edit:  I found another great place to farm money: Hill Ranch. It's a smaller area so you kill more zombies in less time, where as Whitestone gets a lot of drifters from Boulder who will likely shoot you on sight.


####

Ok so, and I'm going to share with you what I learned so that you might benefit as well.

First I'll start with gear

Lets explain the mechanics of the loot in the game to make this easier. Loot spawns randomly at certain hot spots in the world. There are locations/objects which will spawn weapons among their loot

1. Supermarkets
1. Post Office
1. Police Station
1. Military tents
1. Military towers
1. Military vehicles
1. Police vehicles
1. Civilian vehicles
1. Strongholds

There are more, but not strictly. IE: You will find military grade loot at military locations, but that doesnt mean you wont find m4's and AK's in a supermarket.


More over, however. I figure each spawn point in a location has a timer and if you wait long enough, all those timers will prime, and the loot will spawn once triggered by proximity.


**If you keep visiting a hotspot and never find loot there


The higher tier players are farming this loot. This is much like other mmo's with things on a timer where people will find an untriggered stash, if you stick around, you will see a group show up later to collect the loot again as it spawns. This is most obvious in high quality rare loot locations such as the helicopter crash.


**How does this help me?**


Well upon simple observation, I was outgunned when they showed up to claim their rounds.


Over time I noticed that late at night when most of the US servers are not very populated


**Some of the servers had 2-3 players.**


I spent a lot of time at Boulder city


For the sake of lists


**Whitestone Mountain village.**
~ There's been talk about a bug here that kills you but I've not run into it


**Echo's Compound**
I found 2 AKMs and an AA-12 (along with a mossberg and other meh guns). A warning about this location: There is a hill behind the compound where bandits can easily ambush you there


**Smallville**
Kalel's home is a quaint one. I prefer Smallville to Clearview for several reasons. It is located in a ""valley""


There are more, on the road. This place isnt good because of the amount or quality of loot it spawns, but because it doesnt see a lot of traffic.


**Ok great
People have repeated it, but I can guarantee that Boulder city and Whitestone Mountain zombies drop a shit load of money. Last night I had $200 to my name, today I have 14k and after this I'm going to go farm for the last 2.5k for my NVGs.


**Thats great and all

Well if you struggle with the things mentioned above then I suggest sticking to the northmost area of the map. The villages all along the large river there have plenty of loot and weapons and are often not populated. Better yet


Now that I mention that


**Binoculars are OP/IMBA**
I used to see an extra pair of binos and Id leave them there saying nah I already have. Wrong. Binos stack


**Lastly


Headshots kill zombies, and another -after- he recovers his stance. And then again. Dont be afraid to get hit, your hammer swing is far quicker than their undead hugs.


As proof of concept


http://i.imgur.com/kId5f.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/SY4yZ.jpg

Note that I made the 10k by killing 430 zombies.



**Some other notes and observations:**
Now that you have binoculars and you are scouting out a city before you rush in

Take a loot at the hill on the farside of a city that you are at. Notice how the game renders this at this distance. I'm not sure about all graphic settings but lets assume the lower the graphics the less is rendered, you're dead wrong. More over, some trees that have very low laying canopys arent reliable either, as from far you are still quite visible. Things that always get rendered are rocks and the trunk of trees. Positioning is vital. I've found its best to consider the long range and short range implications of the location you are chosing to camp. Ergo, try and find a spot that, from far away, you or your silhouette is in front of a tree (or behind it if the area of contention isn't very far.) You will still get spotted by binoculars, so long as you arent directly visible from very far. Up close is a different story because the grass will keep you concealed. ""What about behind me?"" Well unless you are sitting in a flat field... Lets assume you are in a slighly elevated location. From behind you,,1352761724.0

&gt;The bottom line here is that we love our community

&gt;Now

&gt;The wipe:
- We will be wiping all inventories
- We will be resetting player's reputations
- We will also reset all gold coins. Any you received through purchase of a package WILL be given back to you (so you will lose nothing you paid for)
- We will be resetting all characters stats
- We do not, and as soon as we get it settled I will let you all know

&gt;Item Spawns
There have also been some complaints about item spawns (ie food doesn't spawn often enough

&gt;Also, freeing up those slots.

&gt;PvP vs PvE
There's been a number of discussions about PvP and PvE. When Stronghold servers are up and running (and we'll have a bunch of smaller super sexy maps for you as well) these can be password protected

&gt;Social
Clans are in active development and will be done next week. These will add a clan tag to the users name

&gt;Friends! Friends list

&gt;I hope that clears up a few things- a big part of my time will be spent with the community, and when exiting the game. Please please PLEASE answer these, as they really help us out.

This was first reported 2 days ago, as well.

This 'relay' station, but some of them, the more HD/clearer recordings 'it' plays I've never heard before, and they sound newer too, as if the devs perhaps created them and are waiting for someone to crack the code (the morose code in the video could be it too~).

Perhaps the most creepy thing that happened during this recording, and 4 people running into the building and never coming out (the 'building', is that house in the video), or the fact that not one, but two Number Stations appeared to 'talk' at the same time, and that the 'player/station' name was NOT in the player list at all, was the SSTV signal that the station began to play. At first I had no idea what it was, is that an old SSTV?"", when the image was being decoded slowly my heart began to race, is the scariest shit I have ever seen in a video game.

If this is the work of the WarZ devs, I shall never venture to Rockyford again. ;~;

Hackers defeating the point of the game. We see this all the time in other games, but this is fixable, its not game ruining. I'm sure they could fix this.

Respawn times are too long. I don't like how it's just changed from 1 hour to 4 hours in order for your character to respawn, then maybe they'd change it! 

Lack of features in game. Yeah, and if there is evidence to suggest that they only started work on the game 6 months ago, then they've done a pretty good job so far!

They stole attributes of the game from War Inc. So? Think of all the call of duty games

Their relationship with the community and their attitude towards it. Now this really does annoy me, have a few laughs, die, use another character or just play some Counter Strike! I think we're both to blame for communication between developers and community, and it's hard for me to ignore it when The War Z is popping up left right and center in every gaming forum known to man.

Deception from the developers during advertisement. How does this hurt the community exactly? Or effects of the game? I don't care what they did

Just to sum up what I'm trying to say, so they now no-longer wish to talk to use anymore.

Who knows? Maybe they read these threads and are working on making the game better but keeping to themselves? I doubt it

**1. South-East Towns to Tunnel to east Safezone.**

Quite safe route; not much people around most of the time (beside in the tunnel). If you found some cool stuff in the towns or police station then skip tunnel go directly to the safe zone.

* [Southern town](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/-66.93/74.31) (shotguns
* [Police station](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/-56.12/77.92) (pistols, vests)
* [Northern town](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/-41.97/76.60) (pistols
* [Tunnel](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/-8.23/48.12) (pistols
* [East safezone](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/8.58/102.26)

Time required: 1 hour

**2. City Route**

This route is dangerous but the route is fast and there are much loot spawns around so its pretty worth it. Alot of people around most of the time and so for best results join a low population server. You should run this route if you're armed with at least a pistol and or a shotgun; at least to use the weapon for suppressing fire to keep any bandits away. Also binocular are a must; keep an eye on the highway because there may be snipers up there.

* [Military encampment](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/20.72/79.41) (machine pistols)
* [Houses with the walkable roof](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/24.53/76.33) (pistols
* [""PVP house""](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/21.21/72.55) ^1 (pistols
* [Large supermarket](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/16.80/60.86) (pistols
* [Police station](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/23.24/67.37) (pistols
* [Diner](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/31.20/65.70) (pistols
* [Small Supermarket](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/29.23/68.86) (pistols
* [East safezone](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/8.58/102.26) or [North safezone](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/67.41/29.84)

^1 The ""PVP house"" is very dangerous. Before entering stand still for 30 seconds and if you hear footsteps don't go in.

Time required: 30 minutes

**3. Northern Town to Barn and Military Encampment**

Medicore safe route. The town and the barn are clear most of the time; the military encampment is not. Avoid the military encampment if you found cool stuff in the town.

* [Northern town](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/49.67/29.66) (pistols, assault rifles
* [Barn](http://thewarzcartographer.com/#4/31.73/33.09) (pistols)

1364666099.0,1bb8nj,I feel like the dev's have given up on the game!,GameAddikt,46,27,47,"Hear me out

1). A couple of weeks ago a large patch came out for the game apparently ""fixing"" all the loot spawns, yada yada yada.  This patch DESTROYED the game!  For awhile there meds were just...nowhere to be found, yes meds are back in the game (somewhat) but ammo is still nonexistent, my buddy and I play every night and we haven't found a single stanag clip since the patch, anybody found a stanag clip?  I have found, in total ONE Kruger mini clip and ONE 9mm clip.

Meanwhile the community is crying out at the Dev's asking what it is they are actually doing...what is the plan in the long run...so far, and they treat everything they are doing like it's top secret, which it most certainly is not, and should not be.

2). WHERE ARE THE VEHICLES?  Don't forget about this because it seems like everybody has/did

3). The ""bug"" fixes...wtf are these?  They are nerfing melee weapons?  Melee weapons were FINE why did they go through the trouble of slowing them down?  The bug fixes are pointless, and if they did WHY WON'T THEY TELL US?  Right now the community needs something to keep their spirit up, the forum got hacked, our account information got stolen and still there has been no update about this except from the HACKER HIMSELF...is everybody at Hammerpoint DRUNK?

4). Zombies...why aren't they fixing the ""bugs"" with zombies?  They hit faster than you can with 99% of melee weapons in the game, towers, they climb OVER BARRICADES (in my experience) and I'm getting tired of it, I have a horde of zombies on my and I jump on top of a tower and they climb UP THROUGH THE SOLID ROOF (Splinter sniper towers), I had a zombie climb up the back wall and the up the entire tower without using the stairs at all...what is going on?  Why aren't they focusing on fixing the bugs that actually ruin the game?

My point is the Dev's aren't doing anything constructive

Final point, there should not be in game cash and GC, these should be fused so that you can find GC/In game cash on zombies and if you choose you can purchase more, items shouldn't be so expensive, 15000 in game cash for a stanag 30 mag?  Seriously?  The marketplace is the dev's most obvious scam, they crank the in game prices so in order to afford anything you need to kill hundreds of zombies and if you want to survive you have to buy mags with GC because THEY AREN'T EVEN FOUND IN THE GAME!!!

That is all I have to say

Thoughts?  Conclusions?  Does anybody have any information that would prove the dev's are still active?  I WOULD LOVE TO BE PROVEN WRONG! (Honestly I would

**Useful Links to help you!**:

*Detailed Map with loots spawns/weapon spawns*: http://warz.neon-gaming.de/

*War Z Wiki* : http://www.warzwiki.com/The_War_Z_Wiki

**Basic Information**:

There are 2 things in this game that are going to kill you. **Players** and **Zombies**. Both being able to kill you in under seconds. Keep in mind players are very hostile and will if not 90% of the time kill you on sight. Zombies take 4-7+ hits depending on your talent tree spec and specific armour. 4 being the default from 100% health and no armour.

**Maintaining your Hunger and Thirst bar**:

Iv'e never really gone below 50% on either bar since food and water is so easy to find. Just be sure to eat food and drink consumable liquids when they are on 3/4. When scavenging in different areas and you come across a consumable food but you already have one of the same item

**Zombie Aggression Range**:

Noise + Vision being the values that we take in order when dealing with Zombies and also players. Pressing ""ctrl"" will crouch your player lowering your vision to be seen and reducing the sound in which you make. The distance in which you can move around Zombies whilst holding ""ctrl"" is quite close and should be used fairly often when moving about in cities/towns/loot zones. Prone is another feature you can use by pressing ""z"" which places your character on his/her belly allowing you to commando crawl about at minimum vision and noise. Although this isn't used much when handling with zombies it's a great feature to use in Player Vs Player rendering you harder to see.

**Killing your first Zombie**:

When you spawn you'll be spawned with a flashlight (Melee Weapon). Now in this game when you hit a Zombie with a Melee weapon it will stun it for 1 or 2 seconds (unsure of the exact duration) allowing you to stand there and deal full damage killing the zombie without taking a single bit of damage. Flashlight isn't the best Melee weapon and shouldn't be used if you plan on looting cities/towns. Dealing with 2 Zombies is a bit more challenging but here is how it's done. You'll have to hit the first one and stun it then quickly turning to the second Zombie and stunning it as well then turning back to the first zombie. Rinse and repeat. Take in mind and this is my personal preference and stay in third person mode. You can switch between first person and third person by pressing ""c"". Staying in third person allows you to see a lot more of your surroundings and I'd only suggest using first person once you have obtained a gun and using it to aim your iron sights for a head shot.

**Dealing with other Players**:

I tend to stick to smaller servers and for me I try and stay out of Player killing and only shoot if being shot at. The rule of thumb for War Z is to kill or be killed. Every player I have come across who has noticed me has tried to kill me so in saying this if you see someone either kill them or leave the area and look for a new area to loot. Also don't spray your gun like a maniac. Follow them and make sure you don't give them the chance to retaliate. Make sure that your 1 shot is a 1 shot kill.

**Obtaining your first gun!**:

This location i'm about to show you always has lower tier guns like handguns, Melee weapons, Backpacks, Foods etc.
Location is ""Springer Ridge Trailer Park"" and ""Crystal Lake Resort"". I'll break both these down into 2 sections to make it easier for you guys.

**Springer Ridge Trailer Park**:

This area is amazing and it has NO ZOMBIES around and you can search the whole strip in under 3 minutes. Iv'e only ever witnessed 1 other player here. At the start of the strip (starting from the south) there is a Caravan and on the left and right of the strip are houses which you should check. These spawn food, barricades, backpacks and some other items which I can't recall. In this area there are 3 Caravans which a high majority of the time spawn your first weapon. In the Caravans iv'e found Wooden bats, .22 Kruger rifle, 9mm Jericho, 1911 Pistol, Double Barrel Shotgun

**Crystal Lake Resort**:

From the last house at Springer Ridge Trailer Park I move directly East towards the road heading north into Crystal Lake Resort. This my favorite area and it's where I obtained my first 1, .22 Kruger Rifle, 9mm Jericho and a Spiked bat. The building itself has spawned a M4 (Semi) too. From here on you'll want to search the 4 buildings on the side of the chapel then making your way to the post office then the supermarket. Whilst searching these buildings you will want to kill every Zombie you see. You don't want 2 zombies coming after you because it's hard to learn how to deal with 2 zombies at a time if your new. From here there is 2 police cars on the road which you will want to check inside of. Heading south of the the area move towards the lake which there is a Restaurant and 3 or 4 houses (These are on the east). The restaurant spawns Can of soup, Can of Tuna, Can of Pasta and Juice. All in which if consumed will heal a small portion of your Health (a little more on this later). Make sure to watch our for Zombies ""sleeping"" on the ground. DO NOT attempt to hit them whilst they are getting up because with out fail they will hit you once. The rule of thumb for this is swing your weapon which increases the noise and it will wake them. Wait for them to get up and leave space for them to walk 2-3 steps before bashing and beating them to a pulp. From the restaurant move along the shore and check all the houses as they spawn many weapons from Handguns to shotguns and misc items. This now completes the first tutorial of obtaining weapons and experience. be sure to stick around and kill zombies. Once this area has been cleared you can move back up to Springer Ridge as the area would have re spawned new items.

**My backpack is full**:

Press ""M"" and look at your Map. All the areas that have a red circle around them are SAFE zones in which you can go in store your items in a vault. Items stored in the vault cannot be accessed by other players only yourself. The vault can be accessed from any of your 5 characters. So any items you obtain on 1 character can be stored in the vault and be taken out by another character. I suggest using ""Blue Ridge Settlement"" if your looting in Crystal Lake Resort and Springer Ridge Trailer Park. Takes 10-12 minutes (this is an estimation) to travel from Springer Ridge Trailer Park to Blue Ridge Settlement (Safe Zone). In here store all your items except a Melee weapon and some food and water and rinse and repeat.

**My Health is Low

Medical supplies are quite scarce and are hard to find without entering a city. From my current knowledge normal Bandages heal 15% of your current heal and the Bandages DX heal 35% (This is the default values this doesn't include the benefits from skill tree). Food items can heal you as well. Though looking through the wiki as I make sure most of this information 100% accurate I couldn't find the specific healing values of the food that heals but I'll list the foods that heal a small amount of Health

* Bag MRE
* Can of Ham
* Can of Soup
* Can of Tuna
* Juice (Liquid)
* Coconut Water
* Electro-Aid

*These all heal a small amount of health (Not sure that it's 100% of the time as some times it hasn't healed anything but whenever I see these i'll pick them up always).*

**Skill Tree**:

This is a good feature which can be accessed from the ""Survivors"" menu upon opening the game. Depending on how you want to spend your skill points I advise by getting these skills first: Increased Health

**Final Context**:

Even though this game has a relatively high learning curve it may seem that this game is impossible at first but I assure you it get's so much easier the longer you play. Just practice killing Zombies and sooner or later you'll be able to kill 100+ Zombies without taking a single bit of damage from using a Melee weapon. Keep stocking up your items and storing them in your vault and never take good items when traveling solo. Always team up with friends who you can trust and use your better items when your grouped.

1355582827.0,14w8or,Thoughts on increased zombie spawns,wtfuggShane,26,9,56,"When I first read this in the patch notes I was excited

The increased zombie count seems to work really well at first in a place like Camp Splinter were I believe the chance at higher-tier loot ought to hold more risk

Shortly thereafter, in the middle of nowhere with nothing anywhere near it and that, if we're speaking in terms of lore and setting, would only have comfortably housed 1 hermit. So if I stumbled upon such a shack in the zombie apocalypse, I'd expect to maybe find 2 or 3 zombies *tops*. But this place had 14. It seems that the increased spawns haven't been placed thoughtfully, but rather across the entire map.

I suppose my feeling on this is that I like that the difficulty has gone up, roaming zombies, and zombies that are lying down/playing possum, which I think adds more layers of challenge and strategy to the game. 

I would love to see [normal] zombies of varying speeds, legless zombies that only crawl (all of which are perhaps affected by existing injuries or decay), zombies with erratic patterns of behavior, zombies that are better/worse at surmounting obstacles (some can climb over fences or climb stairs, some can't) zombies that are more likely to react to what other zombies are doing (like following other zombies and even noticing when another zombie within their line of sight nearby spots a player), etc. Basically meaning that should you aggro more than one zombie, the situation will still be tense but you can take on those zombies using individual strategies (take out the fastest one first, etc) instead of the current way that multiple zombies chasing you just means they clump up into a non-melee-able glob that moves at the same speed

I would also like to know if anyone else noticed that the zombies seemed to not be dropping money since the patch. I must've killed a hundred or more but didn't see a single money drop (though one did drop a medium backpack). I know the zombie loot spawns are rather erratic

I get to boulder city. Start looting that bit of road with all the cars. I walk all the way to the end. All clear. As I move out somebody spawns behind me and shoots me in the back.

I'm about to run into Echo's compound. As I run past the car some dude spawn right in front of me facing the other way. So I pop him. The compound is all clear. I run upstairs when some dude spawns on the roof of that little shack and kills me. So I decide to sit there and watch for a few minutes. The whole compound was infested with people server hopping for loot. Some of them obviously knew what was happening so they camped in the corner and shot anyone spawning in but then other started spawning in and killing those campers from behind.

I'm in the tower. I run in

Basically you can never clear an area. You have to watch your back every other second in popular areas. You can't have stand-offs. You have to move around all the time.

One of the solutions would be to check the area you are spawning into and if there are people besides your squad in that area you should be asked to either try again later or have an option to spawn further away. A simple solution to loot hopping would be to make all loot within x meters invisible upon spawning.

&gt;I've got some more information for you I wanted to get out there - it's my goal right now to get as many answers for you as possible.

&gt;I'm going through and answering as many questions as I can throughout the day

&gt;First - I went through like 10 pages of 'Are we in beta?' 'Whens beta?', etc ad nauseam, so I went and sat down with Sergey. After some thorough discussion I want to clarify some things:

&gt;1. We're currently in Alpha
2. The game is open
3. That being said
4. Alpha is over when we're happy with the current state of the game (balance, etc).

&gt;Given our current workload

&gt;For information regarding the wipe

&gt;At this time, this includes both FULL and STRONGHOLD servers.

&gt;Right now we're also investigating a number of other topics, I encourage everyone to continue reporting hacking when its spotted, as all the info we can get helps.

&gt;We're also talking about: an offensive name filter, new characters/animations (a few are very nearly done), and possible server hopping solutions. I've had a number of great suggestions from you all already, but I wanted to officially let you know that YES we know its a problem, and YES we are discussing solutions. For the things I've just listed however I can't give specifics, but know that its next on my list to have answers for.

Once collecting water from a lake you can do one of two things: 


* Drink the water and risk damage to your health depending on the cleanliness of the water - dirty water would have a 9/10 chance to damage you
* Use a ""water purification kit"" (scavenged from around the map) which has multiple charges

1350380974.0,11kaf4,War Z Impressions,geman220,23,6,44,"I see a lot of people here complaining about different things

Personally I think the game is pretty good

Some of the positives:

* Playing on Ultra @ 1080p with no lag / artifacts / etc. 
* Zombie detection of players seems pretty fair
* Graphics aren't incredible but I'd still say they are very good 
* Inventory system is nicely laid out and intuitive 
* Game launch times / connecting to server are quick 
* HUD is really good shows everything you need and nothing you don't 
* Dedicated global and proximity chat 
* Finding food / water is pretty easy

Some of the negatives 

* Game crashes a lot (this is my biggest concern
* You dehydrate very quickly 
* Flashlights 2 shot players but are useless on zombies 
* Weapon spawns seem very few and far between (this could be due to me not knowing the ""hot spots""
* Invisible walls and invisible zombies (is being addressed)

Other things of note 

* The animations are clunky and downright hilarious sometimes
* I love that there is a map but I'd like to have some city or landmarks named on the map 
* I don't completely understand why there is a 1 hour wait to respawn. There are 5 slots and you can delete and recreate whenever you want so you don't HAVE to wait an hour. So I don't understand why when I die I can't just hit ""respawn"" and instantly start over instead of going through multiple menus and disconnecting / reconnecting. 
* I had random issues with the chat box activating randomly and stopping my character 
* I miss having a 3rd person view with a ""movable"" camera like in DayZ. When you are running away and wondering if the zombie is behind you it's a nice feature to be able to look over your shoulder like DayZ.

Let me know what you guys think.

EDIT: Sorry for some reason it just submitted as one massive wall of text.  Fixed for formatting.

EDIT 2: I want to also add that you need to keep in mind Day Z is a Mod on top of already vetted infrastructure (ARMA II).  Most of the mechanics already existed it was just a matter of tweaking and adding to get something different.  War Z however, that War Z is less buggy/clunky than Day Z.

1360144157.0,17zq5i,A quick guide on how to play War Z effectively for new players!,iPhoneK1LLA,45,27,24,"Here's a quick guide on how to play effectively in War Z

1) Flashlight - If you're in the woods and it's dark, so make sure you use it wisely. 

2) Whenever walking from A to B

3) Stock up on medical supplies when you can

4) Don't worry about your thirst and hunger bar too much

5) Don't trust thugs who say they're friendly. Thugs get their titles buy killing civilians like you

6) Avoid highly populated servers. Normally they're filled with hackers with ESP and aimbot. You'll be lucky if you survive for over 20 minutes in a highly populated server with your lack of skills. 

7) Try and find some friends to play with, otherwise you never know when they might turn around and shoot you in the back. Feel free to add me on skype so we can play sometime (Skype: stick_foo). 

8) Only use your sprint when you need to

9) Set your inventory key to 'T' instead of 'I' (or anything you feel comfortable pressing). This will save your life a few times.

10) With the current weight system

11) When taking on multiple zombies try and get them all coming from one direction and keep an eye out on what is happening behind you.

12) Try to keep at least one CO-1 Vaccine on you to make sure you're able to cure yourself ASAP.

13) Before entering a town

14) Holy shit

15) Abuse the hell out of 3rd person. I can not stress that enough. You'll want to use it to check around corners and even in firefights as it will usually give you an advantage of being able to see more since the ironsights are ""Meh"" on a lot of the guns.

16) Play on Low settings. It may look like shit

17) While in third person mode

18) Ammo won't be collected automatically if you reload with a few rounds still in mag.

19) Even though your cross-hair is around the corner doesn't mean that the weapon will fire there

20) When you crawl on a area that makes a sound when walking on it

21) Eat chocolate-bars right away

22) Don't crawl next to a wall

23) Don't think that you are safe during the night

24) Just heard a sniper? Run.

25) Clearview and Campos have much more PvP (Player verses Player) than other towns/cities. DO NOT go there if you've just started playing War Z

26) If you want to build a good global inventory

27) Avoid painted lines on concrete

28) Don't trust anyone who says they're friendly

29) Patience is key. Sometimes it's best to let the trouble come to you instead of trying to go out and find it ;)

Things to note:
When on some vehicles

Just because someone has got to a place you cannot does NOT mean they're hacking.

Not everybody who kills you is automatically a hacker

Just some pointers :) Have fun and enjoy the game!

Edit: Keep your tips coming guys

Read the quote in this article on Kotaku: http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/12/fans-rage-over-war-zs-misleading-steam-description/

The survey being discussed was one that popped up a few days ago when you started up the game, but it does show that there are a large number of people out there who enjoy the game, problems and all. I was among the 50% who claimed that WarZ is good but needs work, so I don't believe it's an amazing game, but I do think it's a damn enjoyable one and so does everyone I  personally know who bought and played the game. Based on that, I have a hard time accepting that all the criticisms being leveled against WarZ are legitimate issues. Either way, I'm not here to make judgments.

But I would be curious to hear what you folks think about the results of the survey. So: discuss away

As I'm coming down the west hill I stop at one of the ambulances on the road
A flashlight beam suddenly engulfed me
I make short work of him with my hammer

Healing up and taking the shotty (that had only one shell left) I work my way into town

Suddenly there's a frenzy of activity

In the proximity chat there's tons of commotion as 5 players try to keep each other from attacking one another

At this point I've made my way along the back of the Post Office

Now

The group had found nothing but a cross bow and an empty pistol and were deciding to move south to the city. 
Being the paranoid guy that I am I keep rotating around and around

I wasn't interested in joining up with them because such groups doesn't usually end well for them. At one point they move off the APC and towards me

Gunshots ring out from the hills as a player spouts rage in Global about someone trying to kill him. The group all scramble back to the APC leaving me alone in the safety of my Cop car.

Looking behind me to the west and the hill I notice Zombies chasing a player in red flannel (usually the most dastardly of players.) He starts to make his way down towards town

Meanwhile the group is finalizing their plans for the city, and that's when all hell breaks loose.

From up the street, the guy on the APC is taken out immediately, another grabs his pistol and starts to return fire, but it seems he only had 4 shots left and then he goes down. 2 of them make their way into the supermarket as the Bowman crouches on the front end of the APC trying to get some cover while also having a higher vantage point.

By now I'm standing up

The rifleman makes his way down

Jumping off he makes his way to the west

His surprise when he gets to the top of the car only to see a player in a Gas Mask looking up at him

I looted his M16 (now empty

Some of you might have heard already that a lot of people have gotten banned lately
I got both hacker/legit friends who got banned with no reason stated
The WarZ-forums got flooded with messages, and they will not handle any related requests.
Are you one of those players that has gotten banned

**What leaves it for us then?**

Simple. They are failing us to bring us a working product. Since we all have paid via Paypal
It doesn't matter what the arguments are at the moment; Person A (devs) ban us for hacking


**Getting money back via Paypal:**

* Just go to www.paypal.com and log-in to your account.
* Go to [My account] and click on complaints centre.
* Select 'Dispute a transaction' and click on 'dispute over object' (I did not recieve a bought object)

 Remember
Follow the steps accordingly and eventually with the help of Paypal you'll get your money back.


**What will be happening next?**

As the developers stated on the WarZ-forums about the numbers of people that got banned

* First: They do nothing. This would result in all the players banned would have their money refunded. Keep in mind that Paypal is aware of this

* Second: They would adequately suffice us from enough information regarding the ban. They would probably have to hire in a billing and account support team.
* Third: Some would get their money refunded
* Four: They decide to unban the accounts. We could say we are all happy now,False,self,t5_2ujwe,1355665772.0,,,t3_14xvd5

Seems he had no weapons as well and handed me a large back pack. This was shocking to me since I like to stock pile back packs in case I die so I don't use a small back pack. After walking a bit the moment of truth comes. We find an m4 on the floor. I have him take it since he did hand me the back pack and fully expected a shot to the face.

Now here's the hard part. Look down at the item you dropped and hold E to pick it up. Wait until the circle is almost completely filled and then jump and look at the item you want on the top shelf. If done correctly

If you do attract a zombie DO NOT sprint! Wait for it to get close and when it goes to swing at you back away. It will miss every time. As soon as it misses walk towards the zombie and simply strafe circles around the zombie while bashing it in the head with a flashlight or other device. The zombie will continue to swing at you but rotate in a circle slower than you and never hit you. After a little practice zombies no longer seem to be huge threat...for now.

**Where will i download the game?**

You will download the client from http://thewarz.com/download.html and it will be roughly 5 mb in size. Once downloaded

**When can i download the game?**

You can begin downloading the client October 15th

**How large is the actual game?**

The game is roughly 2-3gb FOR ALPHA. in the beginning we are limited to ~30% of the map. we will get to explore more of the map aas the alpha goes on.. and we are expected the full map when beta is launched. so actually the full game is between 6-9gb.

**How long will it take to download the game on launch day?**

It will take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours

**Will there be an NDA?**

YES YES YES!!! the NDA (or non-disclosure-agreement) will start October 15th and end sometime in the first week or 2 in November

**What is a NDA?**

A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA), or secrecy agreement, is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. As such

**When will I be signing this NDA?**

You will more than likely sign/agree to it after installing the client or when you first run the game

**Will I be able to rent a server or stronghold during alpha?**

NO

**Will loot be different during alpha?**

YES.. spawn rates will be slightly increased in order to allowed more testing of weapons/items 

**What will we spawn will during alpha?**

We will start out with water, a flashlight, and your map.. although since it is alpha it is more than likely that they will adjust these

**Will there be a wipe after alpha (oct 30&gt;31) or not?**

No

**Why are we limited in the map during launch?!!??**

we are limited so we dont aimlessly wander around exploring

thats all i can think of for now but if you can think of more good questions for launch day feel free to post them and ill add them when/if we have an official answer

This is the TRUTH. We have SEEN IT HAPPEN. This is not speculation, they are not Valve, they are a small group of dedicated and passionate developers, and they do not have the power to simply STOP HACKING the second they wish to. It will take time, but eventually they WILL put a stop to it one way or the other.

1350853274.0,11uzog,My Latest Experience (Long Story!),OneSullenBrit,19,4,2,"I woke this morning, and noticed I was close to a small town, so I cautiously headed towards the town.

I skirted the edge of the town, and checked a nearby building, finding some Antibiotics. Pills in hand, I headed towards the centre of the town.

About halfway to the centre, so I dived behind a burnt out car and watched them move about. They didn't seem to be hiding, but they could just be desperate survivors with nothing to lose. After they had passed, I was debating whether I should just give up on the town, when I heard a call nearby:

""Anyone friendly in town?""

I froze immediately. ""This can't be good"" I thought. When has anyone ever asked that and meant it? It must be a trap! That settles it

""Yes I'm
""Want to team up?""
""Come to the APC in the middle of town"". 

The cry was answered by a couple of people. Intrigued, brazenly standing on the sandbags in the centre of town. I watched for a few seconds, waiting for a hammer wielding psycho or a snipers bullet, but none came. Interest now well and truly piqued, I headed towards them. What have I got to lose?

As I neared them, but nothing else that I could see, the other player had the plaid shirt on his back and nothing more. ""Safety in numbers"" was probably the last thought on my mind, after ""lots of people to kill me"" and ""this is still going to be a trap"", but I stuck with them. A quick check of the market nearby yielded nothing, but when I came out I saw another 3 people had joined us. One of them suggested going to the city, and as nobody had any objections

We were almost undone as soon as we left the town, I had no objections.

We soon discovered that we were quite alone in the city, and everyone had hammers. There were a few hairy moments with lack of food, but we managed to survive from one granola bar to the next. I got lucky and found a can of soup, a foregrip attachment, and a mask. 

Things were going well, trying to grab what we could before we starved. I was with red-mask and plaid-shirt when we hear a cry from nearby. It was muffled due to the distance and the echo from the tall buildings, but it sounded like profanity and accusations. We were to assume things were getting nasty in the need for food. Looking back, I wish that was the reason.

In our meandering from building to building, there were plenty of places to look. After clearing out the building, we discovered it must have been used as some kind of milliner's storage, as we each ended up with multiple hats. We went exploring a little more, but then make back for the brick building. That was when disaster struck.

As we entered, so I stood precariously on a table to reach it. Taking it down and strapping it on, I was about to call out to the others, when *BANG*, a loud gunshot! I stood frozen in the doorway, the body of plaid-shirt laying halfway up the stairs with a bullethole in his chest. ""Bandit"" he croaked, as the light faded from his eyes. And then I saw him - this subhuman scum stalking up the stairs, intent only on murder. I backed into the room, in a building, but I saw none. The place was eerily quiet

Throwing all caution to the wind I sprinted for the diner, and prepared to bash his brains out with my hammer. I turned towards him, and spotted a pistol on the floor! I had to have it! But there was the problem of our groaning friend to deal with first. I tried to brain him with my hammer, but couldn't get a good swing in without him reaching me. There was nothing for it - I whipped out the shotgun and painted the walls in rotting brain matter. I hopped down from the counter and bent over to pick up the pistol, when a shot rings out! I immediately throw myself to the ground, and desperately look around for someone. Staying hunkered down for what seems like an age, I trainer my shotgun on the nearby windows, and no more shots are fired. I slowly raise myself up, I jump up, vowing never to return!

 Some of your burning questions answered (including the ever present wipe)
Hello all

Many of you have noticed my rather sudden presence on the forums here. For an informal introduction, but now you'll find me more present, and I will endeavor to answer your questions. 

The bottom line here is that we love our community

Now

The wipe:
- We will be wiping all inventories
- We will be resetting player's reputations
- We will also reset all gold coins. Any you received through purchase of a package WILL be given back to you (so you will lose nothing you paid for)
- We will be resetting all characters stats
- We do not, and as soon as we get it settled I will let you all know

Item Spawns
There have also been some complaints about item spawns (ie food doesn't spawn often enough

Also, freeing up those slots.

PvP vs PvE
There's been a number of discussions about PvP and PvE. When Stronghold servers are up and running (and we'll have a bunch of smaller super sexy maps for you as well) these can be password protected

Social
Clans are in active development and will be done next week. These will add a clan tag to the users name

Friends! Friends list

I hope that clears up a few things- a big part of my time will be spent with the community, and when exiting the game. Please please PLEASE answer these, as they really help us out.

1350668247.0,11r9ql,A Story to Share: My Incredible Experience with War Z PvP,wtfuggShane,19,8,10,"Last night I had a run-in with a string of bandits-- PKers

I have no proof to offer; I was not recording at the time, if nothing else, I hope it provides some entertainment.

A friend of mine and I were exploring the small town a little ways south of the NW safe zone

Through a small gap in between two fences we spot two players running by, my friend and I aren't above killing other players if we feel there is some benefit in it for us, but we don't do so needlessly nor do we camp unarmed new-spawns.

Minutes before I had just lost my one primary weapon-- a Saiga --trying to reach the safe zone to deposit some gear

[Disclaimer: for the sake of storytelling

Nevertheless, an M107 and SCAR to be precise, and quickly started to back away, but not before we were spotted. We sprinted around a corner and stopped in an alley to see if we were being chased, which we were.

My friend immediately let loose with his crossbow at which point he learned that crossbows in this game are horribly inaccurate

I stood there for a moment in shock, I saw the SCAR-wielder turning his sights towards me just as his friend with the M107 (who had yet to fire a shot) ran directly into his line of fire, taking the last of the SCAR's three bullets to back of the head and saving me from death.

I saw this as my chance and immediately began sprinting towards the SCAR-wielder to cover the 20 or so feet between us

At this point my friend was incredulously yelling at me over Mumble

""With my hammer and their own bullets."" I felt a bit like Tyreese for you Walking Dead comic fans out there.

It turns out that the enemy players' luck with loot only went as far as the guns they had found, and grabbed the M107 for myself, which only had 4 shots left, along with some assorted essentials.

At this point

Not fifty yards out of town I crested a hill and spot 4 players below me about a hundred or so feet away, but, upon realizing that my only option is to fight, I duck behind the hill.

As they near the crest of the hill the player in front exposed the barrel of a Saiga and his helmeted dome which I splatter with the M107. I think the sheer loudness of the .50cal sniper rifle shocked us all

Once I regained my composure, which I discovered at this range was a bit too close for effective aiming, but with without crosshairs otherwise, I had no choice but to make do. Both of the enemy players began to unload on me, but seeing as how one had a Saiga, the other a Jericho, and both had bad aim (and myself being under Lady Luck's blessing that night), hitting one of the players centermass and dropping him. 

The last remaining visible player starts weaving at this point trying to close the gap between us and causes me to miss my next shot. My fourth-- and last --bullet drops him.

The fourth enemy player who had up until this point failed to show himself finally crests the hill and starts shooting his Mossberg at me. With my M107 out of ammo, somehow dodging all 3 of his shots. He drops with a bloody and deadly concussion.

Practically breathless and shaking in real-life, fortunately for me, turned out to be empty) so I rushed him too with my hammer, at which point his morale broke and he took off in the opposite direction. For some reason, though, he soon decided to check behind him to see if I was still following, and I dropped my hammer on him.

I picked up the empty Saiga, including a Custom Guerilla armor vest (only the other Saiga had any bullets left in it, as the player carrying the full Saiga was the first to die).

Being so amped up on adrenaline and nervous about losing my loot, and I safely made it back to deposit my hoard of guns.

I don't blame you if find all this hard to believe, feel free to ask and I shall provide.

TLDR: I more or less solo-killed 6.5 players who tried to jump me. Three of the kills were achieved with a hammer against gun-armed players.

EDIT 2:  Jezerr believes he may have had an encounter with an Alpha Zombie in the new area of the map, he had no weapons and was not recording.  Be sure to check the area out if you are close, and upvote this post so others can see.

Here is my 2 cents.,metacomidor,16,5,13,"I've decided to do one of these things of my 5 likes and my 5 dislikes of the game so far. Now I know these have been done a crap ton but I'll try to be constructive. 

First loading into the game I was pleased to find that the player characters actually meshed in well with the dark and the fog (not sure whether that's due to me playing on ultra or what not but still) welcome find I feel like I am actually hidden when prone in a dark forest. I've escaped and ambushed many people by just going prone in a bush and watching them I think they nailed the whole character doesn't stand out like a sore thumb thing on ultra again haven't played on lowest yet so Ill have to test that.

Secondly The Global Inventory a love hate issue for many. My personal feelings is that it keeps people in the game with out being a 100% blow to the balls. Although the other side of the coin I feel that with clans and end game players they would be running with their own armory and be able to just come back into the game with full on sniper armor camo shit. My main problem with Global inventory is just it is too easy to just camp spawns and server hop and fill a back pack with military loot and just have no loss in death.

Third

Fourthly

Fifthly

Now for what I don't like so far. Guns are way to common and ammo is way to rare. Now let me explain this

How the world is just a FFA at the get go. I usually roll friendly as long as possible until I just say fuck it after being blasted by people saying their friendlies or are a new character who doesn't know every thing yet and decides to hit me with his or her flashlight. I understand its a trust game. In which you build bonds and forge friends through the turmoil but how long do you think that will work for casuals to the game. With how brutal people are to each other in this game I don't see people playing it to long and not just go play some other fps games about survival not FFA ""lol call of duty bull"" shit. Although you can attribute this to the amount of guns are in the game and people can just find them with in 30 seconds of spawning in most places. 

Safezones I get it I get it places for people to put up their feet and trade and what not. It works its nice I understand. I know they aren't done and will have NPCs and ""mission granters"" at them but here's just an idea. Let me transport between them! Sense i cant choose my spawn at least give me the means to meet my friends in less than 3 hours before one of us gets lamed by some random player.

But all in all its been fun so far and I still feel the urge to keep playing it even when its in its alpha stage. So here's to a hopeful future with this game huh?

He was sticking around and decided to try and join the clan. Said he liked their safe zone camping strategy. The clan member with less gear was slowly leading a couple new spawns away from the safe zone when the pumpkin head chick started hauling ass to a good vantage point. As soon as she moved I moved.

I was sticking to around 10 feet behind her. Sticking to the foliage and trees I was on her like a fly on shit. She got to her vantage point and took off her pumpkin hat. I walked up right behind her and took her out as soon as she scoped in the get a shot.

Her clan member and the new spawns came running as soon as they heard/saw the commotion. I told them what happened and that the clan member was leading them into the trap. I told the clan member to thank the pumpkin head chick for the gear and left saying this

* Not able to switch the perspective when in third person.

* When accessing the lockbox and you have an item selected which is in the quick-slots

* Add a name filter to the clans in the community page.

* Fix the favourites in the server browser.

* When going prone on some hills (probably some critical inclination)

* Give us some specific information about the protection you get from gear and also the advantages you get from the skill tree.

* Make it possible to move a lockbox. I'm not talking about beeing able to pick it up

Well the player we had just killed, and we could see him coming. This time we allowed him to get a little closer.

He came in the gateway, and I alerted my clan member he was coming to his side. This player turned the corner, and he got lit up! Anyways, this players repeated this again one more time, and died for a 3rd time.

The 4th he logged back in, which we watched him do, and proceeded to crawl his way to the highest point. Once he got there, he started shooting a sniper rifle at us. His aim was horrendous!

So we decided to creep around and head up the hill and flank him. When we got close, and there was a player there! Thinking this was him, 2 of us proceeded back while 1 of us kept scout and intel of the players location.

As the 2 of us were about to arrive

So the 2 of us each duck behind different trees. While the 3 players are looting our friends body, and it seemed like the 3 players had no clue we were there, we had the advantage.

We let them get even closer, or if he was still alive. Even after me firing, they had no clue where my position was. So my other team mate started firing, and the 3 locked onto his position fast!

While the firing was going back and forth, that is dead, can still easily see them, and is updating us precisely on what the 2 are doing.

So I tell my friend to cover me, and it worked perfectly! I was able to run left and get to a little hill in the ground where I could advance on the and they wouldn't even see me approaching.

I slowly crawl up the little hill, and our dead scout tells me where the last enemy is at. I follow his directions and sure enough, he is laying in prone facing my other team mate that is still firing at the enemy.

I get a tad bit closer, all while I'm still shooting him, and gets 2-3 shots off at me before he is taken out. All shots he fired at me, missed. Not once during the entire fire fight, did my team mate or I get shot!

Once all 3 enemies were dead, did these guys have a ton of gear! While we were looting them, the players were going off in proximity chat, calling us hackers, and they were going to report us, and how we were cheating. 

Not once have we, communication is key! It's what got us a win in this fight. Hats off to my clam mates for making this one of the most memorable gaming experiences to date!

Also thanks to the 3 players which gave us this fight. Good job and thanks for making it fun!",self,t5_2ujwe,1355938701.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/1544yd/most_fun_ive_had_so_far/

1354556272.0,147jkr,Some suggestions to mitigate some of the hopping (something new),ratdump,30,23,38,"I know the topic of server hoppers has been beaten to death... so please bear with me

So the things I hope these suggestions would improve:

1) people who log out and change positions during PvP; this is done to get behind someone who is 'dug in' or otherwise gain advantage over another player in PvP.

2) people who log out in order to avoid dying; for example someone kills your buddy and grabs his items and logs off before you can retaliate.

Suggestions 1)

- no logging off in points of interest. This would also mitigate server hopping loot spots. Basically you would simply not allow anyone to log out/in inside of towns and say for a 100 meters around a town. Since most combat occurs in towns this prevents people from grabbing loot and logging off

Suggestion 2)

- long logout delay after firing a weapon or dealing/receiving player damage. Just damaged another player? Can't logout for 10 minutes. Would help prevent people who hop to gain an advantage in PvP and people who 'loot and run' ... doesn't do anything to prevent hopping loot spots.

Both of these solutions aren't so dramatic that they would interfere with meeting up with friends or anything like that but I think they could be a relatively easy way of mitigating some of the hopping problems everyone is experiencing.

A note on 'idle timeout' ... for both solutions you would need to increase the idle timeout to at least a few minutes. Otherwise people will just kill the game process to circumvent the logout location/time limits. It would need to work like a traditional MMO where even if you kill the game process your character remains in the game for some minimum amount of time (5-10) minutes essentially AFK. Naturally if you restart the game and rejoin you could regain control of your character.",self,t5_2ujwe,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/147jkr/some_suggestions_to_mitigate_some_of_the_hopping/

1349469690.0,110eh5,What is a Stronghold? [Answer inside],,46,37,28,"This is a post copied from the forums

**What is STRONGHOLD ?**
To put it simply it's just a fancy name for a custom tailored server rentals. Our goal is to separate ""gameworld"" server rentals - ie when you rent server with 50-200 slots and choose one of the maps ( okay for now we have only one map available - COLORADO ), clan, etc to make this mini world your own home base. 


**How I can rent Stronghold ?**
When you click PLAY GAME,3,6,12 months ) and number of slots ( 15,30,45 ). Pioneer and Legend packages comes with 1 and 6 months of hosting for 15 slots. Discount will be applied automatically first time you rent stronghold server. 


**What are those maps ?**
They're much smaller maps - typically around 3-4 square kilometers in size with 1-2 ""settlements"" per map. Those ""settlements"" are planned to act as home base - for either single player or group of players. There are zombies spawned on outskirts of the map - so they're generally not a threat on those maps. But you can lure them into settlement. 

**Is there any loot on Stronghold maps ?**
There are few loot spawn locations


**What can I do on the Stronghold map?**
Short answer - whatever you want. Lure other players into traps and kill them. Create a farm

**Can I create my own business using Stronghold map ?**

Things are just out of hand now, it seems like all the wrong people are being banned. People are being banned because their logins failed? Yet you'll see a guy super jumping and going thru the map with a shot gun and he doesn't get punished. There are WAY too many hackers in this game because they all transferred over from War Inc. because they use the same exact engine and everything! 

If Sergey had a team devoted to making this game as good as it could be, taking their money back and leaving. It's because we were lied to about WarZ. Not because it's a scam or anything, because of the lack of just pure effort being put into this game. When I (rarely) play this game now, it doesn't even feel like a zombie survival game. I don't worry about the undead, I worry about the living. Not because I fear he or she is going to kill me for my bottle of water or can of food, it's because I fear I'm going to lose all of my gear I've struggled to collect because of some guy flying around the map. 

When I think of the ""zombie apocalypse "" I think of the world deteriorating day by day, I don't think that everyone in a small town in Colorado carries an military grade assault rifle, while the mail men are packing AA-12's on their deliveries and the local market has their shelf's stocked with STANAG ammo and military grade packs. If this game was to make an attempt to fix itself, there would be less military loot, a hell of a lot less, and way more civilian based weaponry, such as low caliber pistols, like a double barrel)

Also, but the hats are ridiculously stupid. This game feels like TF2 at times. The marketplace and global inventory summed up are bad ideas because you could purchase gold coins in-game with REAL money, and lose them the second you spawn in. I'm surprised these items aren't time based! All in all, this game could be ten times better. I hope they put some real effort into this game instead of patrolling the forums for people who oppose their game.

1352323776.0,12ti92,Has Anyone Else Become 'Zen' Yet?,OneSullenBrit,13,3,14,"I was just wondering

When I first started playing WarZ

When I started up WarZ, was a Saiga shotgun. At the time, I had no idea how rare weapons were, so I ran out of the house I was in, ran up to 2 zombies who had just killed a player (this was first day of Alpha so everyone had a torch, food, water and bandages on spawn)

I was then killed from behind by a torch-wielding player.

Even back then, I raged that I didn't get to use the shotgun properly, I raged that I didn't get to check out anything in the game.

Since then I have died countless times. I have learned not to go out decked out (I play solo for now, I find that having a gun makes you a target more than it protects you, especially when you aren't a bandit.

I no longer care if I die.

I'll give you my most recently example:
This morning I spawned, and find some bandages, then move on to the Airfield, making for the nearest crashed heli. On the way, I notice 2 players running across the landing strip, so I ask if they are friendly. They reply that they are, and I banter for a few seconds before making my way to the tower. I go up to the top, and I hear footsteps. Running outside, so I'm done for, and head to the hangers. I go in from the back

It turns out that I accidentally attacked the friendly pair from earlier

Did I rage? No. Did I lament my sudden loss of shogun

I apologised for the mistake

Don't get me wrong, didn't get to fire it once). I'll accuse them in global chat and warn people where they are. Also if I'm murdered by a bandit with no provocation I'll call out their location. But death in WarZ holds no fear over me any more.

**TL:DR- I no longer fear death.**

I slowly looted this market while watching the enterance. I was hoping to find something to help out a bit. Found a bunch of bandages and antibiotics. Atleast 2 of each. So, I found that I had nothing left. And had no other weapon so I just ran like a hell behind the building and saw a bunch of zombies. I ran through the zombies jumped up on a car and they started going for him and got between him and I. I then ran accross the street to the firestation and OMG A HAMMER!!! I quickly grabbed that and went out looking for where he went. Then... SNIPER FIRE! F***!!!

I run down the street as a few more sniper rounds go off most likely in my direction. I saw 2 other people at the military vehicle down by the super market. They both had pistols out... I looked down at proximity as one of them said, ""THANK GOD"". So, I ran past the sandbags and go into the market there. I found some more bandages and some other stuff. I think I picked up an akm clip as well. But nothing to fire back at that sniper. I step out of the market and the two with guns were still there behind the sandbags. I jump over the ones closest to the market and I hear that darn sniper shooting at me again!!! We all just fell to the floor and stayed prone for a second. One of the 2 people started coming near me with his pistol drawn... So, I decided to drop my empty pistol to give him something to focus his attention on instead of killing me. He picked it up and then stood up turned around and fired at the other person standing there. WTF?! So, I stood up and my new hammer met the back of his spine... Another sniper round goes off and hits me. Taking me down to about 20%. Popped some antibiotics and layed down again.

Hoping that the sniper is not able to see me, sitting here in the post office thinking about disconnecting. I decided not to pussy out and keep on going. Its no fun just giving up. Even with how tempting it was with all this new loot. So, I started out of the building and saw that same guy as before coming around the corner at me with his pistol out again. He took a shot off at me (I thought he was empty) and I put two 9mm bullets in his head and he finally went down. Damn that was a good fight! I grabbed his empty sniper and his Jerico. Went back into the post office and logged out. I needed to let my heart slow down before I get back on. Whoever that sniper was, I must applaud you for giving me an amazing fight. And you really need to learn how to shoot straight! You missed me atleast 9 times...

I truthfully belive that bandits are the best thing about this game. Stuff like this makes me never want to get off. I love it when stuff like this happens and I don't care if someone comes out on top and I lose a large backpack full of amazing stuff. I will likely do the same to another guy some other time down the road like today.

**WarZ and that other game are about people first

There has been a lot of small talk and grumbling about people talking after death, because the solution as I see it is apples to oranges.  The whole system needs overhauled.  Here is what I would like to see out of the release client's in-game communication system:

* **Three Tiered In-Game Voice Com**  We need people to be able to group up together MMO-style, just for the sake of ""realism.""  Secondly, we need to have 2 ranges for in-game voice communication between un-grouped players.  A ""shout"" and a ""talk / loud whisper"" distance would work great.  This would greatly reduce the tactical disadvantage a single, large radius in-game chat channel would impose on strangers communicating for the first time.

* **WarZ needs a death screen.**  Once you are dead, be it a stranger you grouped with in-game or someone you are Skyping with - as inevitably, you will want to meet up again to keep playing.  Dead players should remain in their group, and have full group voice chat, even as they switch characters.  Remember, no reason to disadvantage people who are grouping up with strangers.  Disable in-game chatting and radius voice com, though.

* **Global and Proximity chats - probably still a good thing.**  This game has safe zones

Think about how many War Z stories you read on here.  How many of them are about survival or zombies?  They are about people, but necessary for the long term success of this game, and people need to start making a lot more noise about it.",,False,self,t5_2ujwe,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/123axn/thoughts_on_the_importance_of_improving_ingame/

i played WarZ since the release. Here is my experience.
# Overall:
* graphic: the graphics are okay, but not overwhelming, but i recently played Guild Wars 2 on Ultra, so 
* launcher: the launcher is nice and easy. you can join servers easy and fast. at the current state it is easy to find a server to play with friends.
* PvE: its fine. zombie die easy 1on1. i can handle 3 zombies atm if im cautions. more zombies are a mess.
* food and water: you find enough to survive. sometimes you find to much. but overall its okay
* weapons: way to much. played like 2 hours since patch. found 5 weapons.
* ammunition: really rare

# state of warz compared to dayz:
* inventory: warz is better
* looting: warz is better
* general walking etc: warz is smoother imo
* shooting: i have no experience here

# Bug and Tips:
* zombies lose aggro if you jump on higher ground (a car for example)
* save your stuff in the global inventory
* if you have to
* save your stamina for the right situation
* dont erase your character. they respawn close to the place they died.
* dont use bright hats/mask(for example a skull mask) at night
* if you re in first person mode and u press right mouse click you can switch your angle with shift.
* juice and i think it was tuna raise both bars
* you can find loot in buildings and cars. 
* zombies usally mean that there is loot around

Thats my experience and all i know so far. Have fun! :D

***05-16-2012***
&gt;No we are not going to make it a Free To Play Game.
&gt;
&gt;F that
&gt;
&gt;Most likely it will be one time purchase fee for something like $15-20. Similar to Minecraft. 
&gt;However there will be GOLD currency in the game that you can purchase for real $ money. With that currency you can buy attachments for weapons, but nothing to make you ""WIN"" in this game. Its gona be more for ""comfort"" and cosmetic. 
&gt;
&gt;Everything that you will be able to buy in the store will be scattered and placed around in the WORLD. You just have to find it  And I mean everything. But we wont let people who are spoiled rich or well off in real life purchase Hummer with a 50 cal and 5 HK 417s with top of the line scopes. NOPE
&gt;
&gt;Merchant stores and safe zones will be placed through out the world, take a bath, buy a meal, restock their supplies for their next adventure. Flirt or have *** with others   or check message boards and postings. Most likely even pick up a job/quest by a real person. The guns will not be allowed in those zones to avoid chaos and mayhem. But be careful when you exit out of the Safe Zone. There will be players who will turn barbarians or raiders. Everyone will be free to make their own faction or a clan too.
&gt;
&gt;Another thing we are going to give players is the chance to earn their own Gold (Real money currency). There will be special types of zombies roaming through the world at very special places, and trade that at the nearest merchant, trading post, city, for REAL GOLD. So players will have the chance to go and get those Stem Cells and make real money. Those zombies wont be a joke to deal with though, so you will have to pack military gear to fight them, or work together with a friend.

However there will be GOLD currency in the game that you can purchase for real $ money. With that currency you can buy attachments for weapons, but nothing to make you ""WIN"" in this game. Its gona be more for ""comfort"" and cosmetic. 

&gt;Everything that you will be able to buy in the store will be scattered and placed around in the WORLD. You just have to find it  And I mean everything. But we wont let people who are spoiled rich or well off in real life purchase Hummer with a 50 cal and 5 HK 417s with top of the line scopes. NOPE

&gt;Merchant stores and safe zones will be placed through out the world, take a bath, buy a meal, restock their supplies for their next adventure. Flirt or have *** with others   or check message boards and postings. Most likely even pick up a job/quest by a real person. The guns will not be allowed in those zones to avoid chaos and mayhem. But be careful when you exit out of the Safe Zone. There will be players who will turn barbarians or raiders. Everyone will be free to make their own faction or a clan too.

&gt;Another thing we are going to give players is the chance to earn their own Gold (Real money currency). There will be special types of zombies roaming through the world at very special places, and trade that at the nearest merchant, trading post, city, for REAL GOLD. So players will have the chance to go and get those Stem Cells and make real money. Those zombies wont be a joke to deal with though, so you will have to pack military gear to fight them, or work together with a friend. 


&gt;Should I start a whole new thread about this to start gathering your guy's requests/ideas ?

Example: Two players or groups meet both parties have two basic options
In most cases both groups choose hostility, and getting the jump on the player(s) matters greatly in winning a gun fight.  It's a matter of possible threat and reward.  A person who knows were you are poses a threat to where you plan to go, as they could tail you and help set up some form of trap.  As well as this stranger who you don't know, can't hear, and have no repercussions for brutally murdering may have all sorts of goodies and loot.  Where as working together even in its best case scenario reduces the amount of loot that you individually or your group gets as you have to share.  And there's no way to tell when that other party will defect.  (And attempt to murder you)

Numerically: You have 5 guns they have 5 guns.  You work together share loot, they defect you work together.  they leave with 12 and you're the corpse.  And since both sides defecting rarely leaves both sides with 0 guns. (In rare cases I've found 2-6 dead people's gear with ammo that makes sense that A killed B and B was subsequently finished off by zombies.)  It is almost always a better option to attack your fellow man.

Now here's where value comes in.  In many cases people are far more aggressive towards others because of a sense of value.  For example, as if they die to someone with a hammer or the like they just lost loot that even somewhat common in nature is still very valuable in most situations.  And this escalates the more well off a person is.

Lastly, and group B died and lost his M4 auto and his RDS attacthment amongst other various loot.  Now B respawns at a safe zone rearmed with his less spectacular Mossberg, and immediately runs into another person C (or in some cases person A who had killed B) who hadn't seen him yet and wasn't quite in the safe zone yet.  Since past actions against B have been hostile, B is more likely to take his chances and maybe get back some of what he lost (or get even more than he lost) by preying upon this unwary person rather than allow them to reach the safe zone.

TL;DR:  Look at Wikipedia Prisoner's dilemma explains WarZ bandits.

My suggestions for making zombies a little more difficult is to maybe add in more of them, when you can draw just one zombie out of a pack, instead that zombie would alert the other zombies around it, which would kind of create a chain, and you end up drawing a pack.  That would add for more suspense when entering a settlement, I think.  And I fully support the idea of roving hordes going across the map.

And why the hell have I not turned into a zombie yet?  I mean

I think that maybe if the zombies are more of an issue in this game, this game has less of a ""survive the zombie apocalypse"" vibe and more of a ""don't get shot in the back by every person you see"" vibe.

supplies
close calls with bandits and zombies but so far I have been able to get myself out of 
these situations unscathed
others fall from the dangers this new world presents.  Back to present day
leave to get supplies anything that I could find.  I stumbled across a small town of 
course overrun with the undead
perimeter to make sure that the only movement I saw was from the rotting flesh-bags that 
stood between me and the things that I needed to be able to survive.  

I decided to head into the city in daylight..which could've been my first mistake..but I really needed some supplies..Sneaking around active zombies in the area I raided a supermarket and found almost everything that I needed except for a darn weapon.  I scored a few granola bars, binoculars and some bandages!  As I was packing everything in to my pack I heard gunshots outside of the supermarket window. I flew to the floor panicked.  Looking out I see two other survivors fighting off a group of zombies, as I watch, one of them falls dead, the other managed to survive the others but he looked hurt, I could tell as he was bleeding profusely.  He seemed to also be out of ammo too as the last few zombies he dispatched he used a hatchet so at least I was safe at a distance.  Holding on to the last shred of humanity that I had left I slowly walked up to the lone survivor and asked if he needed any help, and that I was not a threat unless he was.  The stranger nodded as if to say that he did need my help.  Being a doctor in my previous life (before this mess..) I took out my freshly found supplies and bandaged his wounds. This could be considered mistake number two. In return he let me take his friends equipment which was nothing major but enough to keep me going for a while, drinks but no meds or weapons of any sort.  We talked for a while and he asked if I would like to join up with him, if I was 
traveling with him I would always be on edge. Regretfully this is probably mistake number 
three

I flew down the barn stairs as fast as I could without making a sound and look for a good path to reach the building containing my prize
get in unnoticed.  maybe I should sneak around the perimeter of the town and go in from the back!That's what I was thinking and as I turned around to make my way to the outside edge of the town. As I turn I see the survivor from earlier
running full speed towards me wielding a metal baseball bat! I freeze in horror not knowing what to do and.....THWAP! he hits me across the face with the bat, now I was thinking that it was all over, but luckily from behind him the zombies start their attack!  This occupies him long enough that I can get up and make a break for the building with the gun I saw earlier.  Not caring about any walkers in my way i push through them and make my way to the building.  The other survivor must've seen me because he 
started booking it in my direction again with his bat held high above his head.  Trying to push myself harder I run and jump through the window and quickly pick up the gun, spilling his other supplies from his backpack.

 Now I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world, they must be hearing  all the damn noise my gun is making.  I go for the broken window that i entered the building through, but they are already flocking to it outside.  My last bullet I use as I'm jumping out of the window to clear a zombie from my path.  Now I am all out of ammo with a large group of 
zombies after me.  I run for the woods and as I reach the edge of town I see a bloody hammer lying on the ground
made..I wonder if what it would've been like if I hadn't stopped.  Anyways, of all the times I thought I would die I actually thought that I was going to live through this.

My absolute biggest problem is the hour timer upon death. I understand the reasoning; there should be a punishment for failure and simply hitting respawn makes death a small concern. However, which I slowly learned to avoid.

I think it's poor game design that I'm essentially forced to take a break for an hour or roll an alt if something goes wrong. Misstep and pull a horde of zombies? Log out for an hour. New friend turned out to be not so friendly? Log out for an hour.  The fact that most of the time I was time-out'd 5x the amount of time I spent playing a character was incredibly frustrating. Once I""ve learned the ropes I'll likely live longer but regardless

The timer is especially punishing to new players who are learning the game and might die within just a few minutes of spawning while they learn controls

""So just delete the character and start again!"" I did! But it turns out if you roll over 5 characters you stop spawning with a flash light or any other supplies. I'm used to this in DayZ but being stripped of my flashlight was pretty brutal for a new WarZ player.

Anyways, if it comes down to 10 minute playtimes with hour long time outs I'm not sure I'll be able to see much of it at all.

**TL;DR:** 1 hr death timer is punishing to new players learning the game; makes it difficult to get hooked on an otherwise pretty neat game.",self,t5_2ujwe,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/12e0ot/noobs_thoughts_on_the_death_timer/

And so he did. He came around the rock and I was ready. Bap bap bap bap! I probably used too much ammo, had no ammo. Oh well. He still seemed threatening, I didn't regret my actions.

Fast forward several minutes. I've made it to the city, and turn to see two following close behind me. I had my pistol out and didn't want to waste ammo, so I figured I'd lead them around a bit until it's safe to switch to my Spiked Bat (god damn them for not letting me have both equipped in my weapons slots!). I circle the building once and then head inside the door, and suddenly come face to face with another Survivor. With two zombies hot on my tail and this guy popping out of nowhere I didn't hesitate -- I let off 3 shots and he went down, then quickly took out my Spiked Bat and finished off the zombies. Turned out the poor guy didn't have a single weapon to his name, but he did have tons of supplies, which I desperately needed. I scarfed down some granola bars and a can of soup and continued on my way.

Several minutes later, not *too* close, but close enough I should worry about who's holding the weapon, and what he's shooting at (I'm guessing another player). So I go into Hunter mode, slowly and carefully moving towards the sounds of gunfire, crossing under the collapsed overpass and through a fence. I hear another shot. He's somewhere on the other side of the building I'm next to, across the street. I wait for signs of movement

Then I see him, and waits there, Mossberg out, watching down the street. 5 seconds later a Survivor comes around the corner and is shot down. He didn't have a gun, but did have a bat, and *was* headed right at the guy, so I guess the shooting was arguably justified. But I wasn't going to take any chances. He looted the body and then continued down the street

Eventually he stopped, and put 3 into his back. He pops like a pinyata, a Mossberg, a Stanag mag, an MRE, assorted supplies, and a ridiculous number of backpacks. I take everything I need and leave, my 20-minute action-packed scavenger trip complete.

Along the way I meet another Survivor just inside the Safe Zone. I stop and we chat a bit, and then we part ways.

Pretty fun game. I don't feel I was too overtly hostile. I saw threats and dealt with them,False,self,t5_2ujwe,False,,,t3_124w1t

Two days ago, the rush of hunting them , taking out their stragglers and hiding from the rest ( I'm playing solo ) is the best. However, i notice the next day that they are no longer on my server. Saddened by their lack of presence, which basically served to make me more of a threat on the server I look out to find their teamspeak. ( I used the teampeak search function, searched their clan name. )

I find the server and use a different nickname to log in, fighting zombies, protecting each other, and gaining their trust. I eventually ask why they left server 123 and found out that ""swag"" (my bandit's name) was too big of a problem so they found a new home server.

After a few hours of playing with them, with a shotgun and a pistol , they are three heavily armed guys, two with body armour.

The new guy we joined up with is the sniper, about half way there BAAAM. The sniper guy drops dead, and im confused as hell. Over teamspeak one of the players screams ""sorry sorry, it was an accident"". One of our four man group had accidentally blasted the sniper with 12 gauge slugs. I quickly realize as the other two and i stand over the dead body that I no longer have to worry about 3 guys turning on me, now its just me , and two extremely confused survivors. I pull up my Mossberg and end the one with body armour, one shot to the face. As i hear the other say ""what the fuck"" over teamspeak i point at him and end his life. Now sitting on the ground before me are two alice backpacks

Once they quiet down in teamspeak i tell them calmly who i am, he's a bandit, but he wouldnt do something this fucked up.""

We found enough water, and pain killers and antibiotics to last us for a good while. 

We decided to start trekking north as 90% of the zombies weren't moving due to a bug. 

Soon we came on to the place known as ""The Tunnel"" where we found chem lights and flares galore but no weapons in site. I really wanted a good gun by then.

Next we came up on the major city that is reachable on the current map. We check through building after building to find nothing that was of use to us. The last building we looked in though we found two pairs of binoculars

We soon made our way to the small town that houses a big police station which was my main goal to get to, that person was wearing a cowboy hat. I decided to kill him to see if he had anything good on him. I fired all 13 rounds that I had and hit him maybe 8 times. I have no idea if he bleed out or if zombies got him but when I went around the back of the building he fleed to the 10% of zombies that were walking and working correctly chased me down.

The first thing we need to look at is where we're at.  It's a post apocalyptic world.  Zombies walk the earth.  Mass production of items is no longer an option.  Food stuffs are going bad.  So there's only one goal. Survive.  

Now what I find interesting is how many people think that if you're PK'd by someone, people will do what is necessary.  If I'm starving and notice someone with a nice fat backpack strolling by, chances are they have what I need to continue surviving.  Now I could easily walk up to them and say ""Pardon me, but could you spare some food?"".  In some instances this may actually work.  Who knows, you could even form a partnership with that person.  But most of the time, these people who have a good deal of stuff in those packs are going to guard it fiercely.  They can't trust you, even if you look as though you have nothing at all on you.  What's to say you don't have a pistol shoved in your waist, you could easily start following them, but if it's necessary to do I will do so unapologetically.

Is that banditry?  Well, their global inventory is stocked and ready to rock, and killing other survivors is of no benefit to them.  They kill for the joy of causing other people grief.  

So I want to see how other people define their Bandits.  Fire away.

Now, I've come across some players that made it so ridiculously easy for me to take them out that I actually felt bad doing so. Not enough that it stopped my hammer, of course, but when a player is practically offering up his goods on a platter for you, it would be a mistake on your part not to take advantage of the opportunity.

Which made me wonder: if I'm not even trying to find players to kill and I continually encounter clueless survivors with no concept of self-preservation, but rather survivors being oblivious to the metaphorical targets they paint on their chests with their actions.

Fact is, but that doesn't mean you can't make efforts to increase your average lifespan a bit.

So what I'm going to offer everyone is a bit of general advice that may seem like common sense but rarely seems to be practiced in apocalyptic Colorado:

- Camouflage. This is probably the biggest offender I've noticed. I don't care how cool you think your dude looks with his skull mask and orange vest that shows off his ripped triceps, the more skin your character is showing, the more reflective you are (sorry Vincent, Michelle). And I don't necessarily mean that we should all become Colorado rednecks and start wearing cammies, but sticking to muted colors-- greys, greens, browns --makes a world of difference. I can think of at least 5 times where I was moving directly within a character's cone of vision and they failed to notice me and soon after presented their spine to my hammer. Who knows how many times I've been unaware that I was in danger but avoided death by simply being less noticeable.

- Safety. Most players understand the concept of taking cover under fire reasonably well, not silhouetting yourself against the outside wall of a building or fence, going prone whenever you're not moving. The best way to sum up the way you should be playing this game is to play it under the assumption that you are always being hunted by another player just out of your sight. Never assume you are safe and never fully trust someone you don't know. Sprint across the street towards the nearest cover, keep an ear out for footsteps, and, if you see proximity chat pop up, even if they are claiming to be friendly, there's a good chance it means a player is nearby and that you should be extra cautious or even planning your exit. Never use guns on zombies unless the situation absolutely demands it and never try to melee more than one zombie at a time; if you aggro more than one zombie and have no friends nearby to help your best choice is to run


Notice I don't go into much detail about specific features of the game, basic strategy can only help make my own interactions with other players more interesting. At best, it may even help curb some of the (dare I say, unfounded) negative dismissals of a game I'm enjoying the hell out of, PvP and all.

So, play smarter, safer, have more fun. Maybe with a little situational awareness it'll be you getting the jump on the bandit next time. And for chrissake-- stop committing suicide by running down the middle of the road. 3am on a server with 5 players or not, you're practically begging to be put out of your self-created misery.

I cracked open a new character and went looting off in the boonies, bats, backpacks and binoculars. Binoculars. I'd never seen them before. They were a prize. I had to get to a safe zone. 


The town below me was peppered with infected, hugging the wall as near as I could, and keeping low. It went higher and higher, and eventually seemed impossible to pass. Sprint. Run. Spring Run. I kept at it until I found purchase, and continued on. It seemed I found a cliffside. I couldn't be seen, and no men were to be found on the highway. I risked a few short sprints / rest cycles and made my way to the south east encampment. 

Eventually, eventually weaking me to a dangerous level of health. I could still make it, but I couldn't survive so much as a clumsy swing from a flashlight. Still, the slope to the grass below me was shallow, I could easily walk down and-- bam. It was over. My inventory exploded from my expiring corpse as my body glitched through the rock. 

What the fuck was that. 

I loaded up and alt, I guessed the most direct route I could from the encampment, and climbed up a ridge to access it. Suddenly I couldn't move. A game wall. I must have been on one before too, and wound up dying trying to get across it. 

No matter. I'm I was unarmed now. What did I have to lose? I jumped and ducked and prodded across the narrow ridge above the camp, I made it to the other side. Wide open spaces and scattered trees. Clearly, I wasn't supposed to be here. Good enough. I used the open area to make a beeline for my downed items, eventually recovering them. Then, I made my way back to the edge of the save zone. Log out. Deposit.  

...and then I went back. The huge mountains beyond the gamewall begged to be explored. I made for the hills.

The hills are far less intimidating then they look. I learned very soon that what looked impassable was easily run up. Before long, and some roads. I could see it all, and I could see nothing. Looking at the mountaintops in the distance, I found I could see below the skyline. White space. There was a void. 

I wonder what happens when I jump into it?  

Ten minutes later, I bugged my way back to a human shape.

I'll just have to find another entrance.

1) As we open more of the map space
2) In next few day we'll add feature that allows you to see on players list who's around you and what are their reputation. 


Those are ""natural steps"". But we want you guys to give us YOUR FEEDBACK - what do you think should be done to lower PK in a game. I mean - this is PVP game

Anyway

What's the real truth behind this so-called ""Zombie Boss"" that supposedly has been spotted one time and supposedly documented to be killed by one person so far. There was even a facebook announcement on the person who killed it.

Here's the link to the Facebook Page as proof of this:

http://www.facebook.com/warzmmo/posts/302270796556901

From what my two friends have told me, but it just wouldn't go down. 9/10 people were supposedly killed, while the last one **finally** managed to unload on it and finish it off, and the server had an indicator on it saying ""(Insert Username Here) has killed the Super Zombie"" or something like that, and the chatbox then exploded with commotion over it. Again, this is all what I've been told.

Upon doing a lot of research on this matter

- He only comes out at night.
- Is very large; estimated to be about 8-10 ft.
- Only spawns for a limited amount of time and is UNBELIEVABLY RARE.
- Has a large hoard of normal zombies surrounding/following him.
- Discharges Green Goo of some kind.
- Takes a shitload of hits to kill.

It was around 2:30 A.M. and me and my friend decided that it was just the right time to hop onto fresh characters are begin our journey yet again in the world of WarZ. We had the previous night been taken out by bandits at the Transport Plane Crash so we spawned relativity close to the airport. We were playing in a low population server and just wanted to gather some gear in hopes to defend ourselves in case we were attacked. We cleared the airport and gathered a few melee weapons, we were let down and only found a single bottle of water to quench our thirst. We decided that we would give the tower one more shot so we decided to server hop to another one of our favored servers to check if we could find anything there.

 Upon logging in on the new server we were immediately greeted to the sound of footsteps. Let it be known we do not kill for game but we kill to defend ourselves. There was a person on the inside of the command tower holding a shotgun, and my friend were gunned down. I was pinned to the outside of the building and I could hear plenty of footsteps still inside the tower. It was like some sort of mexican standoff where me and the other player who killed my friend just waited in anticipation of each other running through the door. Let me also remind all of you that at this point, there was ATLEAST 7 to 8 bookbags on the ground in the top of that tower, and items everywhere. After a few minutes I notice one of the book bags on the ground move slightly. I had found my guy prone in all the items on the ground! He wasn't looking towards my direction so I decided to go all in and rush him through the window, and with a few shotgun shots later I had killed him. Bear in mind that during all of this I have the shakes like no other because I know the reward that will follow if I killed this player. At this point I feel like a king, with loot all over the floor. My friend who died at a character close by and was running to the tower that I was at during the gun fight. We both manage to start gathering the loot and it felt like being at a candy store where everything was ours. (The video link to my reaction of this can be found here. (will edit when off work)) While looting my friend ask me did you hear that? and boom someone respawned outside the tower and had now killed us!

 No way we were standing for this, decked in gear like no other. Luckily for us because of the split in direction they both looked at my friend to the left, where I flanked them from the right. And guess who now has the characters decked in gear like no other :) As soon as we killed them it was probably 4 in the morning and I had never felt more exhausted in my life. 

I have had great gaming moments but this one was like no other for me

i don't know if these have been already suggested but here they are

Future Game ideas:
Alternating weather effects: Rain, fog, moving clouds – added immersion. A day and month system is currently within the game, maybe they could also reflect the time of season aswell?

PvE incentivising is a MUST
Lootable zombies, fireman) At the moment players have a huge incentive to kill other players as the reward of looting players is most satisfying. Possible boss zombies, going back to traditional mmo styles with a chance to drop unique loot. At the moment server hopping is a detriment to gameplay as it provides a huge advantage to those who abuse it. Allowing zombies to drop loot would help eliminate this factor.

Killing zombies could reward players with experience also
Possible roaming zombies, more zombies! I want to be fearing for my life and never feel safe from them 
Player titles and name plates. I know that the devs plan to incorporate nameplates

Visible ping and current server information on pause screen or on TAB.
There is currently a problem where some loot is unreachable
Please eliminate players from being able to turn off terrain decorations as it provides a huge advantage to those who abuse it. I know that it requires a lot of rendering power and may become a detriment with low spec computers

Traditional mmo /commands such as /invite and /whisper “playername”. I know that you guys will incorporate a friends list and have the idea to expand clan team play
The ability to control each aspects of the audio

Hunting for food would be a nice addition to the game play. But perhaps something like this is already in the works. Campfire creation etc. Fishing would be AWESOME.
Possible water canteens? Don’t want to copy ‘you know what’ to much though 
Provide cool downs or animations which require the player to stand still when applying bandages or taking pills

Perhaps some crafting elements? We can only dream. I am not going to touch on this to much as this is a very big thing to ask for but I guess players could smelt down duplicate weapons for scrap to build items such as wire fences and other items which offer utility.

Give players the ability to unlock the camera, having the ability to run away and look at them would be ideal as having to turn around to look at them allows them to gain additional ground. (possible suggestion)
