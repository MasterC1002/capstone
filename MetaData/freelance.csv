1) You will get cabin fever

2) Many ""businesses"" on the internet are posing as something they are not. They want you to believe they are a situated

3) Most of the ""time saver"" tools, whatevers, are not going to make you a good Freelancer. The key to success as a freelancer? Work hard. The amount you put in is in direct correlation to what you get out of your freelance career. ( Ironic coming from someone posting on Reddit, I know).

After I got out of the Army 4 years ago the shift in lifestyles was too drastic for me. I had isolated myself from the outside world once I got home. I used to be able to work in the public setting (stores, or be in the public. Loud noises spooked me, and groups of people gave me a lot of anxiety.

So, layout). I had a lot of experience with Photoshop, though. Having used it all throughout high-school as a gaming nerd online. 

After a few months of testing and playing around with Joomla, modules, plugins, scripts - etc. So, I decided to maybe make a little money off of it and I posted ads on Craigslist. The first few months were awesome - my posts were very personal, and at this time I didn't have much competition.  

Every new website that I built for local businesses was a new website that taught me something different. So, css, html, etc. For the next 2 years I supported myself by posting my freelance ads. Most of the people I worked for were just... assholes. But I had no idea what I was doing. I just hoped that they wouldn't call me out for not being a real programmer.

As time passed, I was now spending 2 months on a site and I was still only making $600-$700 bucks.

So, you've gained your goal. Anyways, I stopped freelancing for a year and worked as a video editor (friend got me that job, learned a lot, too). 

Fast forward to this year after we got laid off and my only option was to freelance again. This time, I still am - but it's not how I advertise or market myself. I created a unique company name and licensed the DBA. I created my own brand identity and I speak as though I work in a team. I have created policies, rules and started to study business. 

I employ a project management system for clients

I understand how the idea of labeling yourself as a freelancer seems more appealing to both you and a client (they think you're easier to get along with than a company - and cheaper). Which, that nice freelance guy that we hired who was willing to bend over backwards and make pretty absurd compromises for me won't mind... you know, not getting paid. He's a cool guy, he'll understand.""

If you advertise yourself as a cool

Take 50% up front encase (as they so often do) your client gets over it and just walks away. Anyways, then that's awesome. I use open source CMS's, and 3rd party components - but come on.. who doesn't these days? You know damn well that in order to custom create and develop a full featured CMS and software, from the ground up, you'd need a team of guys, or 5-6 months, at well over $30k. 

I market myself to small business owners who don't know much about the internet, I can give it to them. But, if they come in expecting 100% custom code - sorry. I don't have the time or resources (Even if I had the knowledge) to do that and still be able to charge you $1,000.


So, and improve. Don't be scared to use open source components - I often purchase modules and components and their licence rights if the project deems it. It's a time saver, and a cost saver. If I pay $50 for an AJAX contact module with file upload capabilities that works across unlimited domain names - I can make my money back in just one website. 

Anways, and people will be less likely to stand up to you. If you come off as just some kid fresh out of college looking to get your feet wet, then you'll continue to get those bartering offers (wanna trade a site for some speakers?) or you'll continue to not get paid, get pushed around, etc, etc. You know what you're doing, they don't - that's why they come to you. They might act like they have it all figured out (yeah so, so build me an entire site for $200) but they're just trying to low ball you. Even IF they have some understanding

I once fell for the trick of being hired on as a freelancer to build this company a website, I went right into building the website, but this time I was their employee so I was on their terms. I actually ended up putting the website together in 2 weeks, and then I was fired for being 2 minutes late from lunch. Yeah, I knew what had happened. My initial quote was $2,000 at the time, and in those two weeks they had paid me around 600 bucks. I went in thinking this was an opportunity to grow


So, they don't accept small jobs, and that's your niche! Go after mom and pops - but understand that ma and pa are penny pinchers, and you must, for the love of god, set your policies and rules right up front and do **not** differ from them. Once you give an inch they will take a mile and make it into triathlon. 

Hope this has helped some people.

**EDIT**: Seriously, ""Huh, now that I know - why do I need this guy?""

If you have a client who likes to chest bump, and you appreciate the information but your job isn't to mimic everything that another website has **unless** you agreed to do that at the beginning (in writing). I don't know what it is about web design, but the clients man... they start to learn off of you, and then they want to become part of the process and design through you via proxy. I'm not a god damned UI. They seem to always want to change things and I'm sorry, but I just don't do that any longer. I even break down software pieces into packages.

If they want a video player added on, I tell him ""go to my pricing page and look at how much that costs."" It saves the hassle of confusion. It's a lot of work to break down packages and set pricing limits, but you have to weigh all that out in your mind.

After trying to collect from her for about 3 months, copies of invoices and receipts of payment, and even some pertinent email exchanges.  After waiting at the court for about an hour and a half, our case was called... and she promptly asked for a continuation.  The judge, without second thought, granted it to her and gave us a new hearing date of today (May 23rd).

I will not speculate as to whether or not her reason for getting the court case rescheduled was legitimate.

So today, I was pretty well prepared for how the trial went down.  I probably shouldn't get too much into the ""he said, she said"" details, but suffice it to say I had an answer for every one of her accusations with evidence to back up my claims.  The only evidence she brought was the first invoice she ever paid me (which I had brought copies of, as well).

After about 15 minutes of hearing our case

The journey still isn't over because now I have the arduous task of actually collecting the settlement from her

1) Always have a signed contract for work performed.

2) Keep organized records of every transaction and agreement.

3) For each contract

4) The court system can be your friend if you are in the right and have evidence to support your claim.

About a year ago I started to do some work for a guy who runs a company in, after this, and to my eternal regret we began talking about a new project. It was a somewhat complex site for a client of his in, we shall say, New Zealand.

This project had basically no spec. There were also no contracts involved. Over the months that followed we were bombarded with new features

Recently, he totally flipped.

Now, his lawyer costs plus $10,000/month for the past 14 months for money he also claims to have lost. He also says he has asked his lawyer to pursue me on criminal charges as he considers failure to complete this project to his liking is fraud. In addition, the ""NZ"" guy wants $20,000 off me within days or he will follow through with his threats.

In total for this project

To be clear:
The guy who is threatening me is NOT my client. He is the client of the guy I was working for.
There were no contracts in place for ANYTHING

The threats I received are with the police but I'm aware they will probably do nothing about them.

I realise there is no substitute for legal advice but atm I cannot afford any. I guess I'm just looking for some general info on whether I am totally screwed here. Am I on the hook for $100

I'm sorry if this comes across badly. I'm totally alone here and I have no one I can talk to. I hope by writing this to at least get a few things off my chest and if possible a little reassurance. Even if it happens that I'm totally screwed

In that time I have been working as a contractor and not had much free time and wasn't sure if this website would actually get much of an audience since the other sites are so big.


So without the fear of anyone else stealing my idea and doing it themselves I will give a quick proposal here and it would be great to see how much interest there is.


It seems nothing has changed in 2 years to make things better considering one of the sites has this on their homepage ""Only pay freelancers once you are happy with their work""!! That needs to stop.


So my website will be called Fair Freelance


But I wan't it to be heavily moderated by admins (me at first) and the freelance community through admin tools and a voting system (inspired by Reddit and StackOverflow) for the community.


An example


All posts
E.g. Illegal, bad client etc


So say you are a client and you get a bid that says ""I can do this


Bids are public


Now what is the point in this? Well hopefully we can educate clients to value our work and they will start to understand how much time and money your skills cost.


There will be thresholds to only show bids/posts etc that have a certain score. This will get rid of most of the crap while you are looking for good work/freelancers.


There will be voting rules built in to reduce spam


Clients or ""freelancers"" who get such a bad score can look to be penalised or banned. We don't want people trying to undercut each other either.


Also want to be able to have contracts on the site when a bid is accepted and realistic negotians of payment


It might be good if the community can help out with disputes also. Say client doesn't want to pay for deliverable because they don't think it's worth it. Or is this going to far?


Just with these mechanisms the site will probably never have as many jobs or users as the big names but we can start to have a place to go to find quality clients and quality freelancers that all understand each other.


So I'll leave this here and see what interest I get. Feel free to add your recommendations for features or whatever.


I am a .NET developer and will be able to build this. Will get a designer in to make it all look good. My weakness here would be on the buisiness and marketing side. Legal aspects like the contracts would need help and getting peopel to the actual site.


The only real way this site would work is if we all work together and do a small bit when you are looking for a job etc and help educate the clients.

1367338104.0,1df1tn,"Client has requested more than originally agreed upon, refuses to pay for any work done (even the original agreement) and is still using my work. It's been 24 hours. What options do I have?",snowcase,30,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1df1tn/client_has_requested_more_than_originally_agreed/

**Background info:**  
Started communicating with a company to do PSD to theme conversion. They sent me the layout, anything outside the original agreement would be billed accordingly and they do not own or have rights to use any work I've done until I've been paid in full. We also did not include a deadline. I get a deposit of 50% of the original agreement. This was about a month ago.  
  
**At the start of the project:**  
They requested the work to be started on a Monday and be completed on Friday. I told them I had other clients but I would do what I could. Then I get the actual designs which are obviously more than we had discussed. I make this observation known multiple times.

**During** (11 business days total)  
Client requests immediate response to emails

Multiple additional changes have also been requested putting the project at about 125% more than originally estimated. The additional changes are functionality based which we had discussed would already be done by their team at the start of the project. I make these observations known.

**Final straw**  
I tell the client that I can no longer work under these circumstances and they're taking valuable time from my existing (read: paying) clients. I tell them that our agreement did not include a deadline and that I was not on call. I also did not appreciate the communications outside my operating hours nor the numerous changes and demands beyond our agreement. This was after an email I received at 9pm requesting

He says I'm being incredibly unprofessional and my invoice was out of line. I reminded him of the terms in the agreement we both signed and the numerous things he's done that I would consider unprofessional. He refuses to pay the invoice stating that the work is not completed. I again remind him that my end of the agreement was completed at the end of the set number of hours we agreed upon.

I just checked the site and he's using my work without my permission. I sent him an email simply stating that I saw he's using my work and that he had no right to until I was paid for my work and then copied the section of the agreement that stated that. No response.

***TL;DR***  
Client signs agreement without deadline. Turns out they wanted much more than original agreement. Work goes more than double the original estimated time. I tell them I no longer wish to work with them and send them the invoice. They refuse to pay even the original agreement balance and are now using my work without my permission.

**Options?**  
They are located a few hours away from me in another state. I've documented everything I can. I don't want to get a lawyer involved but I will based on principal. Is it worth it or should I file with their local small claims? Is there anything else I can do to persuade them?

That word is resinating with me at the moment thanks to losing a bid towards a lower priced company. I was contacted last week to ""rush"" a website out the door just so they could have something online within a week for some event (but complete the entire website within the following 3 weeks). I offered to include SEO, ""We can get this project started fast if you agree to $1

I know what I'm worth, so I knew going in that I'd be low-balled, so I replied that we lowered our price to $1,200. Still. Not good enough. Finally I replied back that we WOULD be able to finish the project and have a front-page working and up by the 1st week for 1,000. However, we would have to scale the scope back by a week, thus making it three weeks. 

We needed to do this so that we could fit in another project and not take away the quality of it. So, wasting my time and finally working down to his low-ball price at HIS terms, he stills screws me over.

I'm happy that this fell through. I refuse to work with someone who will haggle over $400, and usually is the various personalities that you end up working with. You can really tell a lot about a client by just how much they initially haggle and how much creative control they seem to ooze from the start. I'd rather work with someone who is easy going from the start, and although still questions our pricing doesn't try to haggle with us as if our skill-set is just some common skill that anyone could learn.

Essentially, the way that they worded everything would have seriously impaired my ability to work with other projects and clients in the future.  I would have essentially been an indentured servant, with no way out, and no way to continue my business outside of this relationship with my client.

I'm sort of disappointed that the agreement was so heavy handed and one-sided.  I feel that they tried to mislead and take advantage of me.  I am so happy I got an attorney.

If they do want me to sign an agreement, and allow me to use my experience and new skills learned on other projects and clients.

In short:  Watch out folks!!!!  Corporations WILL take advantage of you if you're not careful.

1338491147.0,ueav2,How do I tell a very difficult client I don't want to provide a support contract?,maltpress,21,1,27,"**TL;DR:** Very difficult client finally

I can only apologise how long and ranty this post is but I'm quite upset.

So, I turned it into templates and some custom functionality, turned it over to the client for content and to polish off final bugs once they'd populated it. While I'm doing this I do a rescue job on another site of theirs, again Wordpress, adding some functionality and fixing things where I could. I bill for this and hear nothing.

At least three months and many follow-ups later, bill for the cost minus a day (for the bug fixing I was yet to do) and chase the well overdue invoice when someone new calls. She's just been hired as a digital account manager. Hates the design of the site I built. Pretty much accuses me of being a terrible web developer because it doesn't look like the PDF she was sent of the original design; I explain I built the Wordpress templates from HTML and CSS I was given, and it actually looks exactly like them. Tells me she doesn't trust me because there had to be bug fixes on the other site. I Explain what HTML and CSS are and how they're different to templates, and that it was me *doing* the bug fixes on the other site - I didn't build it. Ask for my overdue money.

She pays what's due on the rescue job

Now, if a little overworked and slow to pay, so I said as long as the functionality would be the same I'd do a reskin and only charge the initial amount plus an extra day - after all, the legwork was done, and it was going to be a refresh, not a total redesign, and then I could finish it all and get paid

A month later and I'm introducing her to the designer I always use because her designer hadn't come up with the goods. Alarm bells ring even louder but we meet and she seems fine

Design starts. Every design is rejected, changed again: and the brief/feedback is awful - ""it just needs more pop"", ""make it more artsy but also corporate"", ""I'll know it when I see it"". The wireframes I help her draw up change and change again without consultation (the finished site - she has just realised - has no way to create sub-navigation after she removed it from the wireframes, design and spec!). I'm asked for several quotes for websites with no more brief than ""we need a website"". Questions about brief, tech spec, func spec, and their client's money

It comes to a head when she wants quotes for four websites to be built in two months and *that's the extent of the brief I can get from her*. Nothing more. 

On top of that I start building their new site and the signed off design and func spec are changed half way through the build

Finally - at least three weeks late after amend after amend, the back-end is needlessly complicated because of this, and the design has been diluted to the point that it's unrecognisable. But they like it. And it's done and I can move on to the frankly wonderful clients I want to work with.

- Have **the client purchase the shared hosting / VPS** and he'll take care of the payments.

I hired a voice talent to help me out with a project last year. They did a great job and my client loved their addition to the project.  I paid them very quickly (pretty much as soon as the project was approved and finished)

We had no contract

Well

Fast forward to US tax season, so I hadn't noticed that the amount went slightly over $600. I emailed them and told my situation.  Let them know that I researched the issue and I have until August to file a late 1099 with them and the IRS. I'll still be paying penalty on it, and they might too.  The research I did via the IRS website, showed that even though they did not have a 1099 from me, they should have had record of and claimed that income.  They did not. 

So I send them a W-9 to get their info. SS#

No response. 

I call them up and they told me they just went through a bad break-up and asked if I could call them back in 2 weeks after they get their life straightened out.  Fair enough

I call back.  No answer and no return of my voicemail.  I email

Finally, and of course their agent doesn't want to be a part of the situation, but agrees to send an email to them on my behalf through the agency. 

I just simply stated

That was earlier today. 

Tonight I get a call/voicemail from them.  Stating that they talked to their accountant and to file all of the paperwork and pay taxes on the amount, you're going to need to send me $400 so I can pay that off, then ill send the w-9, since this is your mess up, not mine""

Everywhere I read stated that if you didn't  receive a 1099-MISC

Personally, I just wrote their name in the slot. 

What should be my next move here?  I shouldn't be responsible for their accountant fee and penalties and tax

How do I get their info to file a late 1099 with them and the IRS if I don't have a w-9 from them?

I want to just tell them they have no option to get money from me because it rightfully was their mess up to not include that income on their return.  But I don't know how that would solve anything.

TL;DR : freelancer won't fill out late W-9 until I agree to send them accountant fees and filing fees because they say it's ""my fault"" although law says they should have accounted for the amount I paid them anyway. What should I do?

Looking for feedback on feasibility



Hi, I occasionally take on freelance work, as my free time allows. Over time, I've made it a goal to get better-budget clients, but most of the projects have been small, short, and low budget - not even close to enough to let me quit my day job. Before this latest project, for a mostly simple WordPress site. Since there was very little content and a minimalist design, and that's where I'd like to be.


Earlier this year, so I based my estimate on billing $50 per hour. Sure, what this client wanted would be more complex than the previous Wordpress site, plus we'd be designing a ""placeholder"" page to put up on the new domain while we were in development, but I figured double the budget would be enough to cover that.


I ended up being wrong in my estimate by orders of magnitude. By the end of the project, just so I could secure this seemingly lucrative opportunity. Another factor was that this particular client wrote me e-mails far more frequently and with more questions and concerns than had any other client I'd ever had, and my time billed just to look into something for them or explain something to them was tacking on time as well. I had burned through almost the entire budget just to finish the placeholder and start the full site design; still to come was finishing the design, and all of development and QA. 


I could see this coming early on, not quotes, and subject to variance, I knew any overage of the estimate was not going to go over well, and was unlikely to be paid at all - especially if the only reason was because I had screwed up in estimating. So, I made the decision to not bill the client over the estimated budget, and simply eat the loss to my time and profit. At first, a lesson to be learned. But


And that's not even the worst part. I had planned from the beginning of the project to hire an outside developer, minus the offset of time spent managing that person, I'd have even more profit margin. I knew my friend's skill level well enough, from having helped them with code problems, saw that they had at least some professional projects under their belt, and I figured they knew enough to do the grunt layout work, while I handled the Wordpress aspects and the JS. Turns out, needed a lot of hand-holding, I had to pay them for slow and sloppy work. 


The worst part is that the poor time estimation also carried over to the outside developer's work, the amount I paid them actually exceeded the amount I made from the client by a few hundred dollars, which I had to pay from my own personal savings. In the end, this project -lost- me money instead of making me money. Needless to say, it's been a distressing few months, and I can only be thankful for the fact that I'm making such horrible business screw-ups while I'm still working full time, and while losses sure are deeply upsetting and keep me from having nice things for a while


However, this book explains how the workings of our brain make us susceptible to many kinds of fallacies and biases that get us into all kinds of trouble. One chapter explains something called the ""planning fallacy,"" wherein our brain applies best-case scenarios, optimism, and skewed perceptions when making plans. He even tells of an example he went through personally where his team experienced a similar level of epic failure working on a project to write a psychology textbook.


The real kicker to the story is that someone on their team had brought up, and those that had been completed took about 7-10 years. Their project was only a few months in, but they had only budgeted two years. The smart thing, of course, given this revelation, would have been to abandon the project or change the estimated timeline. Yet, even these neuroscientists, basically shrugged off these inconvenient truths, and was never even used after completion.


The solution the author proposes to combat the planning fallacy is to always look at the hard data first on projects like the one you are planning, not just on your feelings and guesses. Even those with plenty of professional experience in doing those kinds of projects are still subject to bias and wishful thinking. Perhaps, if I had been able to look at data about other freelancers' Wordpress web site projects, and see how long it took them, I would have seen numbers that were more realistic than the ones in my head, and would have known to not take on the project without a much higher budget.


The problem is, or centrally and easily, available. But, I have the crazy idea that, if it seems feasible, I could create some kind of user-generated database for Web freelancers to share this kind of data with each other. Now, I can see many potential problems with this. Of course, amount of content, subjective mood or just their discipline level. Now I'm no statistician


In addition, number of pages/views/states, approximate total word count, their years of experience, their level of familiarity with the technology on a scale of 1 to 10. Still, that barely covers all the variables put into something as complex as a web site, is still quite subjective, even if they have the best of intentions). However


Even though I'd expect such a database to be anonymous, I feel that -some- data is better than -no- data, and that I'd have to start -somewhere- if I want to be able to reliably circumvent the planning fallacy in myself and others. I know that the planning fallacy is a very common problem in the freelancing world, and I would like most of all for no one else to ever have to experience the painful failure and loss of money that I went through.

A problem has arisen when a client has asked for the source files of one of the projects I did for them. I haven't done this before so I told the client that I charge a lot for my source files and what they needed it for.

They were somewhat vague

&gt;""In the contract it says the source file can be purchased for $500.""

So at this point I was like ""Oh I don't remember agreeing to that or reading that in anything I agreed to"". So I decided to revisit the 3rd parties documents to make sure I was clear. The only thing could find anywhere was this:

&gt;Do I have to deliver source files when the project is completed?
&gt;A: Generally no. But if a commissioner does require this

So I told my client to contact the third party that got us together to get clarification. They thanked me and said they would contact them. About a day later I get an email from the third party stating:

&gt;""The client has reached out and paid for the source file. Can you provide it and then also add $250 to your invoice to us so you are being compensated for it?""

The idea is to offer clients 3 options

1. Client requests maintenance work
2. Client prepays for maintenance, with a bigger discount on my hourly rate depending on how many hours they prepay for. When they request maintenance work, I do this and then subtract the time from their prepaid hours until they run out and they have to purchase more.
3. Client goes on a 'deluxe' maintenance contract

* I do any maintenance work requested with no limit on the number of hours per month
* I provide a guaranteed minimum response time of, meaning I will begin working on their request within that time or earlier
* I provide the client with fortnightly (or maybe monthly) website analytics reports
* I automatically update their CMS when updates are released
* I do nightly backups of their website
* I manage their email accounts (e.g. add new email accounts when requested)
* I add new features/tools to their website (e.g. if I make some nice new feature of some sort for another client that would be useful for them as well
* I provide training on various parts/features of the website (e.g. teaching the client or their staff in how to use the CMS)

Option 3 would need to be fairly expensive

So what do you think of offering these 3 options to clients? Is it a good idea to provide them with so many options in the first place

**EDIT:**

So based on the feedback I've got so far

1. Pre-pay for maintenance in 10 hour blocks at the regular hourly rate.
2. Have us on a retainer, and if they needed more than 10 hours in a single month, any extra hours would be charged at our regular hourly rate. This retainer would include the benefits listed above (minus the email management).

Lessons learned (please add or critique):

* I'm still a novice and have a long way to go.

* Do not fall for the sunk-cost fallacy. The more time and energy I sunk into these guys, then pushed me away by going back on promises (see below). 

* Promises are worthless. By my count, they said ""sure, that's good,"" and then came back with a whole song and dance about HR's policies, my experience, their limits etc. after they reaffirmed they picked me over lots of other people (who I bet walked away).

* Be aggressive. Push for the sale. Set deadlines. In the beginning, and when I want to meet, they responded. If I had just set a deadline and demanded a definitive ""yes or no"" answer, this might have been concluded in weeks, not months. On top of that, we would have started our relationship with far less strain. 

* It's not usually a good idea to trade price for volume, do you really want a client you don't have a great feeling about to have a document that guarantees them at least half of your working hours for months or a year? For a mediocre rate? I could potentially lose the opportunity to take on work from higher-paying clients; that, or I'm going to be burning the midnight oil.

* People hide behind bureaucracy. HR is always the scapegoat.

* Learn to say ""no"" and when to walk away. If you can't afford to lose a sale, it's often a waste of time to offer endless alternatives. When I definitively said no when they tried last-minute to cut the minimum hours, I didn't offer a solution. They came back with one that I chose to accept.

* Don't be afraid to ask. In the end, what person my age makes that much per hour? Truthfully, it was fraction of what I should have asked. Realistically, I can never expect to raise this rate.

* They need you

* You're the expert. Act like it. They had never hired someone for my position before. They didn't know what to expert or what they needed. Again, not a business negotiation.

* Be prepared. Have set rates and terms. Know the answers to likely questions. Be ready to justify your prices. Most importantly, so it was a surprise to them when HR (rightfully) said the agreements they made were just not possible. In the end, it turned out that all they had to do was ask HR for a simple 2-page form. **We could have reached an agreement and signed papers in minutes, not months**.

At this stage i'm building up a nice paper trail too (had to send them account details and they've confirmed they received) so the money should be with me with me in a couple of days max once banks process it.

I was at a fork in the road:

1. Revert my changes
1. Continue with the switch and bill them for it. 

I decided to take the low road and continue with the switch. I regret this decision.

A couple of weeks later they started complaining about Weather Source B. They said the temperatures were off again. As it turns out

I have to do something about Weather Source B. So I have another fork in the road:

1. Revert my code to the old Weather Source A code
1. Find a Weather Source C and get that working: 
But then I feel I would need to bill for the second switch

Not much is really at stake. It took under an hour to make the original switch.

What should I do?

One thing I have seen happen every so often in the agency world is that projects go into a state of *on-hold* or *dead* due to client neglect. 

The most often scenario is that we sign on a client that we will design and develop a website for but they are going to write their own content or hire a copywriter to write content for them. They never get content done (or they do get it done months or sometimes years later and want us to honor an old contract). 

Sometimes its an e-commerce site that fails to give us product information

If I do decide to become a freelancer

Do any of you run into situations like this? What do you do

Here are some of my ideas. 

* Receive payments by milestone. Basically

* Add a term to the contract that protects me from client neglect. I still need to iron out the specifics of this, or any other reason. 




**EDIT:**

I think I figured it out. I will ask for payment in three phases. This is crafted to put less emphasis on the project completion, leads to the possibility (inevitability?) of some clients delaying completion of the project and not paying the final bill. This three phase formula means it is clear I get paid for all the work I complete. 

Phase 1 Design: this phase will need to be paid before beginning the project

Phase 2 Development: since the ball is in my court during this phase

*At this point, which is more than the standard 50% up front, 50% upon completion.*

Phase 3: Content

Maybe I am over thinking it and should just adopt a 50/25/25 payment strategy. 50% up front,,False,,t5_2qhs9,1374431447.0,,True

I was recently told to stop work on the projects (8/25) and when I invoiced them for the month of August leading up to that point they are refusing to pay saying the work is 'practically unusable'. I have NO idea where they're getting this from as I built the websites from the designs they gave me and even tested them in all the modern browsers and had other devs look at them.

Both sites rendered fine in modern browsers I had even sent screenshots asking then to reply with a ss so I could see what was actually wrong. They even refused to tell me in words what was wrong with the work I gave them and are just refusing to pay.

(2) Hire me as an outside remote contractor on an as-needed basis with regular virtual office hours and business travel as needed. No visa needed. This is probably better for them as they don't know how much work they'll need.

And that got me thinking: some stuff adds significantly more value for a client, doesn't add much value for the client, but needs to get done. Here's what I have been able to come up with so far for different rates:

* Standard Contracting rate.

* Emergency rate: Covers anything that would normally be done under the Standard Contracting rate

* System Architecture rate: Planning, and technical documents. This will be significantly higher than the SC rate because the value for the client is much higher for the time spent.

* Re-factoring rate: Cleaning out old code bases, etc. This will be lower than the SC rate because it takes a long time, and is more of a ""long term investment"" type of job.

If you have a blog or website where you promote your freelance services you'll get more traffic and potential customers if you optimise the site.

Some basics of SEO are:

* **Keyword research.**
Use [Adwords KW tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool) to find relevant keywords. Use those keywords whenever relevant in your website
* **Page structure.** Use keywords in your page and blog post titles. Preferably have a few keyword matching categories in your blog.
* **Linkbuilding.** Do link building slowly. Don't submit to all places at once. Some places to get links are directories, friendly blogs.
* **Web analytics.** Check Google Analytics for link building ideas
* **Content creation.** With only 6 content pages you won't get significant SE traffic. Post good content and post often (once a week at least).
* **Social media.** Promote your best content in social media for relevant traffic and links. Have good titles

And yeah I know some think search engine optimisers are evil (some of them are)... but keep in mind that at least 50% of all online traffic comes from search engines.

When I asked for clarification

&gt;Thanks for the work. For ""Wife Phobia""
They are to identify/ find out if other people (their friends/ neighbors/ relatives) are afraid of spouse. ""Is Jack scared of his wife?""  ""Is Cindy afraid of her husband?""  ""Is Mike of Engineering Dept a buttock kisser who loves to please his boss?""  
""Do I marry your mom too"" and ""Do I marry your dad too?"" are to find out if one marries their spouse and the spouse's mom or dad too. 
Some folks who are married found their mom-in-law telling the spouses what to do. It's annoying. Examples:
1. Don't buy light bulb brand A
2. Don't park your car in the sun. It gets dirty fast

4. We must buy washing machine brand K cause that's my mom's favorite

In the 4 years since then I've been supporting myself with a minimum wage shop job and trying to build up my design competence in my spare time with the aim of eventually becoming good enough to get a job in the field.

It's not going particularly well. There just aren't enough hours in the day and while I'm slowly getting more competent

I occasionally think about giving up and focusing on moving ahead in retail

So I had a thought the other day. 

Previously I thought it would only be possible to go self employed if I could reach a skill level that would guarantee an income that could support me. Say £10

But I don't suppose I don't have to right away. I'd surely be eligible for Tax Credits if I couldn't generate enough income to support my self. It would be some close to the bone, then I would be able to spend some serious time advancing my technical and design skills to the point where income support would no longer be necessary. 

I've been trying to read around the subject but I struggle to find a handle on it all. Where do I start? 

I imagine I would have to set my self up as self employed and start generating income before I left the retail job? I would probably have to synchronies it all with the availability of tax credits and housing benefit as I don't believe you can apply for either of these at any old time.

Not sure how pay would work. This is my first time commissioning an artist for something like this. Whats fair for a project like this? I not rich but definitely willing to compensate for quality work.

The wedding is on September 18 so I kind of need them soonish

Now, please let me know what you think.

- Take small jobs I can find.
Even the dreaded $50 logo craigslist post. While craigslist seems to be the basis of thousands of horror stories

- Apply to listings on freelance websites.
I have researched and bookmarked a number of sites where consumers post listings specifically for freelance work online. I will apply to all of those that I can

- Start a blog.
I have a domain name registered where I have my portfolio now. I would like to convert that into a blog to share my thoughts on design. I have heard a few stories of freelancer designers getting some of their best clients from their blog. If people can see I'm interested

I've been doing freelance since 2005, of course, end up looking like shit with their requests so I'd never show anyone the sites). I have been trying to break this habit, but I have run across something recently that is making me waver.

A few months ago, and an hourly rate for any of the book work. She paid half the website fee up front, and I finished the design and everything I could. All the site is waiting on currently is the content, which she has not yet sent me.

The project was put on hold for a couple months while I waited for her content. It turns out that she's been sick with something that requires chemotherapy treatment (I don't know exactly what). 

Yesterday, but also reminding her of her agreement to pay an hourly rate for this (in this case, the rate was $50 an hour).

She responded with the following:

&gt; Here's my problem, but don't have the money to pay for extras.  What should I do?

""Extras"" in the above referring to the book covers not included in the original website quote.

While I can afford to give up the money that it would take to do the number of book covers (I estimate it at $400 to $750, because I work a full-time job as well as having other freelance customers that I know will pay and that have stricter deadlines.

I just am really torn. I feel really bad for her, I need time and money to live on too.

Any ideas?

I've recently moved from Canada to Germany to pursue a Masters in Computer Science, which is proving to be quite a strain on my finances.

In Canada, considering it was my first job. The second one was better, and I started out doing mostly frontend development in JavaScript, where I was involved in every part of the process (design, testing, implementation, etc.). Then some backend stuff (not really web stuff, so while there was a network component, so the application was much more robust).

Now, since my official address is still (for the moment) in Canada. The thing is, I'm not a web designer; I'm actually not terrible at web design, but not great either. Unfortunately, most freelancing jobs I see require you to be both developer and designer, and I can really only do one properly (or at least I only feel confident as a developer). I much prefer an office job, so freelancing would be a temporary thing for me (especially since I'd start my studies in some months).

I'm not sure where to start; I know I don't have the skills to design and implement large scale applications

Any advice? Should I give up freelancing at all? Is it possible to find pure development remote jobs that don't ask you to be a ""rockstar"" or ""ninja"" or some other bullshit title? My ideal job would be one where I would be integrated into a team for a determinate amount of time

Photoshop - Again

WP - I'm not so sure I'll be able to write plugins for WP

VB - Same level as Photoshop

SQL and C - There's no point in mentioning these at all now. I was waiting to see if people said to work on them more or something

I was impressed, track hours, manage support tickets, timelines, collaborate with whiteboards - share files; set up automatic billing; etc.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ik2vn/what_to_do_about_my_pennypinching_employer/) is a thread she posted a while back when her current client started giving her problems.  

Here's my take on the situation:

She got referred by a friend to a retiree who needed reams of music transcribed.  Friend used to transcribe the music

My girl started negotiating a price with the dude, just him complaining about his own idiosyncrasies.  Customer is always right, and she fixed them and logged the hours.  

Then he started whining about his fixed income and started trying to chisel her on the hourly rate.  

Now he's saying he can pay her half of what she's owed for the last piece she did and the other half mid August when he gets his SS check.  

Oh by the way

I told her not to meet with him today, just pay me all of it when you have the money, and I'll give you the piece then.""  I also told her to stop working on his stuff for the time being.  

I read this guy as a total shitbird who's trying to pressure her.  I think if she takes a check and turns over the music to this guy today

Your thoughts and advice would be appreciated.   

**Update 1:** He called her a little while ago about meeting up.  He wants her to give him the CD of music *yet to be transcribed* back.  He also complained about the quality of the work the previous person he hired

I told her she should give the cd back

I'm going to give her a pep talk during lunch and accompany her to meet the guy as moral support.  She'll do all the talking

**Update 2:** They met, and without the music he has yet to pay for.  She went to the library to check out books on freelancing and starting/running a business.  I bet her lunch that he comes up with all the money in a week or so.  

**Update 3:**  Customer called her within 30 minutes of the meeting ending telling her he could have all of the money for services rendered tomorrow.  Called it.  I wonder where she'll take me for lunch?

**Update 4:**  We just spent an hour and a half on the phone with her father (a lawyer and former magistrate) drawing up a contract for the customer to sign tomorrow.  We didn't list checks as an acceptable form of payment because her father and I both got a funny feeling about him post dating or passing bad checks.  Money order, and everything will come with a carbon copy receipt.  

Thanks for all your help and advice.  Hopefully this nails him down.",,t5_2qhs9,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/ioghv/it_seems_like_you_guys_deal_mostly_with_web/

I met with the prospects one time just to chat about my background and what they need in high-level terms. We talked for about two hours.

Then at a meeting about a week later

The web app will replace a home-grown spreadsheet + visual basic spiderweb that helps industrial manufacturing product managers do better product planning and analysis.

These guys have been using this spreadsheet tool for years and have trained hundreds of customers.  It is very complex

We all agreed that it would be tricky to estimate this project in any honest manner up front because they're going to need to explain stuff along the way.  So

Anyhow

I really want to do this project!  It matches my skillset very well.  I have to stop myself from already starting to write code.  I keep checking email compulsively waiting for a response.


I suspect that the prospects are just really busy running their business and my proposal is just one of many things going on.


Talk to me about how / if / when I should email the prospect and ask if they're in.

More generally

**UPDATE**: sent a one-sentence email to prospect saying something like ""we're interested in this project and I'm checking in to see if there's anything in the proposal you want to discuss.""

Got a fast reply; they're on the road and they'll get in touch next week.

Thanks for the encouragement everyone!

* Weekly
* Fixed per task/feature

You should know

 - This is remote work

Even if you aren't interested, just so I know how much I am going to need to invest and how easily I can make this profitable. Thanks :)



**Project #1 (Web App)**

btw - if you use emacs and org-mode

The basic premise is this:

 - An interactive quiz tool that asks the user questions
 - Based on the users answers
 - The best way I can think of doing this is having each answer associated with a +/- number for each item
   - E.g. Have you seen the movie Spiderman? Yes. Did you like it? Yes: +500 Spiderman 3, all others unchanged
   - And then at the end
Check out a super-simple demo I made on Heroku. I can't post links

A bit more detail
 - I would like to have a way of generating new apps on different topics

   - questions
   - answers
   - items
     - including info
   - answer ratings (yes: +100 for x
   - answer explanations (shown after each inputted answer. If you liked Spiderman 1
 - Features
   - Most likely a part of the MVP
     - mailchimp integration to get updates on other 'surveys' (call them cfys) or the topic of the cfy (e.g. superhero movie news)
       - later version: ability to intersplice random questions like 'would you be interested in a cfy for action movies'
     - ability to get a direct link to share your result page (build in twitter+fb buttons)
       - the shared page will show the winning item
What I would love to know from you
 - How capable you would be of doing this
 - What would you use to build this? Rails works well for me as I love heroku
 - What is your hourly rate? Sorry to ask this
 - Can you give any sort of estimate on the time required for a basic version? And maybe the time for some of the features? Sorry to ask for this
 

**Project #2**

iOS apps

App #1 is a progress picture tracker for people into fitness

App #2 is a jailbroken app, and allows users to put a password and time lock on the modification of that file.

As above

1287442481.0,dt1ig,Freelance In NYS Questions,ianmaroney,6,0,4,"I've done a small amount of freelance work

A few of my questions/concerns:

* Do I need to or should I get a separate tax id?
* Should I register as a business (LLC or otherwise)?
* Do I have to get a separate account freelance income (or is this just helpful)?
* Any sort of insurance I need to start paying as a *business*?
* Is there a hard percentage that I'm going to be require to pay

I have a bit of a paperwork aversion, etc. A couple of jobs ago, I had an employer decide towards the end (part of my reason for leaving) that he wanted to pay me as a freelance consultant, and not have taxes withdrawn, but only on occasion and without telling me. I would get a handwritten check (a coworker and I called it birthday money because it was like getting a birthday check from the angry Italian father we never had) with claims that the payroll company we were using was being replaced. Come tax season, I ended up having to pay tax on that ""freelance"" income with no warning. The whole thing left me a little soured towards freelance work and I felt cheated out of money (which I probably was in that case). I don't want to be shocked this year or end up having to scramble for money I don't have.

Anything you can share with me about freelance work in general would be greatly appreciated.

I think that's crazy, but a professor I talked to told me she knew things weren't going to work out as soon as I said there was a contract involved.  Its a crazy old world.

________________________________________-
I asked in /r/design last night and got some good insight; someone there directed my attention here

I have a contract with a start up swimwear company to design their debut collection.  Its a big job but they have more dreams than money, they take another step towards their dream of being moguls.  I love doing swimwear, so this should be a fun job for me.  

A little background about me: I'm finishing up what will be my last semester at a great design school.  I won't be graduating as 1)this would have been a 2nd degree and I don't really care about getting a design degree, which I've done very well in, 3)I'm pregnant and do feel ready to move ahead with life, but ideally at my own pace.  I've been in the workforce before and I'm just ready to move ahead with a new design career.  I'm super self motivated and until this contract came along, I had been working at developing my own activewear/lifestyle collection.

The contract is super simple.  Too simple

Since signing, they seem to think its all about fashion shows...which the industry is increasingly treating as superfluous.  A nice thing to do if you can, but only one of many options for promotion.

And then the crazy started to unfold.  At one point they casually asked me for the first major deliverable over a month early for some photoshoot unrelated to this line, so a month was not sufficient time to finalize sketches, select colors and materials, pattern and sew everything up, especially at the rate they were paying.  We had agreed to a specific rate and specific pacing to reflect that.  If find out 2 weeks later the purpose of the shoot is to promote the new label.  They apparently planned on putting the models in simple swimwear purchased from god knows where!!!!  So his initial request 2 weeks prior turned out to be a bit of a stretch of the truth. I have not seen the result of this shoot.  When I found out the full plan it was the day before it was meant to happen, and I found out with one of the models present and couldn't say much.  I just weakly suggested that they consider photoshopping the other swimwear out and putting in their logo blazed across their bodies.  I don't know if they followed my advice or if their graphic designer came up with some kind of solution that does not involve promoting a brand new swimwear line featuring a different brand's swimwear.  This guy is a relentless self-promoter and seems to believe that inflating titles makes a difference.  He keeps referring to me as the line's creative director, which is just ridiculous and now I'm starting to feel like no matter the quality of work I do

And now pay.  They paid me the first installment.  The 2nd due date comes and goes.  I remind them a week later.  They say oops, and after some research he says he accidentally used the company's new savings account check instead of the expense account check.  I guess I could understand the mixup, and I do think he intends to pay me, but at this point without anything in the contract outlining what would happen as the result of delinquent or missed payments, I wonder if I should just get out now.

We're due this week to do final selections/small refinement so I can move forward with patterning and making samples.  I would be happy to give them the sketches and concept work in exchange for what they owe me thus far,False,,t5_2qhs9,1365611110.0,,,t3_1bzkvk

My question to you is: Do you market yourself as just yourself or do you market yourself as an operation? Have you switched and seen benefits or downfalls of either?

A couple observations:

1. No surprise

2. With just a small number of responses there are still 15 mostly distinct challenges listed. Anyone who is considering freelancing should take note of that. There are some amazing benefits to freelancing

3. The issues span both hard and soft skills

So I wonder what can be done? Some of these challenges are basically just things you get better at handling the longer you do this. Others seem like some specific tools and networks could help improve

For instance, easy/simple method of forwarding projects, and if it's going to be a subcontract type relationship, a clean way of managing the red-tape/admin aspect of it all. 

For the other challenges that are mostly about gaining knowledge and experience, maybe it's the restrictions of the reddit platform...maybe this is just really hard stuff and not solvable, but I can't believe it's not improvable.


So

1. To those who have the softer problems: finding inspiration, and rates--what have you done to improve these skills? What's worked well, what hasn't? Any possible solutions that you wish someone would build?

2. To the challenge of finding good clients: sites like elance/odesk/etc are hopeless for many for obvious reasons. What about flipping it on it's head: connect with other freelancers and only we can post jobs. There's a whole suite of challenges of course, if that'd be of interest? 

3. Have any of you used sites like https://grouptalent.com/main/employers http://www.folyo.me etc? Seems there's a bit of a newer wave in these sites

To be clear, the challenge is just in the middle bit. 

Anyway

I'm not contracted to be the person editing the video (though it is likely this will happen at some point).  I have a feeling they are going to be slow at actually making efforts to retrieve their footage or make a move on getting it actually edited

Do you limit how long you hold footage for a client?  How do you word this? ",,t5_2qhs9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1c5l9u/videographers_do_you_limit_the_amount_of_time_you/
