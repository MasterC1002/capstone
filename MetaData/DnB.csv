1362093844.0,19fdze,My Thoughts on Netsky LIVE (bit of a rant),bronze4lyf,53,11,70,"Just wondering what people think of Netsky's live show with the band. Honestly

1) The formula of a band playing one song at a time with a break in between each one didn't seem compatible at all with Netsky's DnB. Of course I understand it's supposed to be a different experience to the usual DJ set

2) The songs were terrible. I'm not a fan of Netsky 2. The only song I can really get in to is ""Drawing Straws"" but that wasn't played. I'm pretty sure the only songs he played that weren't on 2 were half of Black and Blue and half of Secret Agent. I'm aware that Netsky 2 was produced with the intention of it being more ""band friendly"" but again

3) The atmosphere. Although you could say this was more down to the crowd, and everyone's moshing it kinda sucks.

That's the end of my rant. Had to get it out somewhere so why not over an internet message board! For the record I'm a huge fan of early Netsky classics and fully support a DJ going in ""new"" directions. I just think Netsky live is completely the wrong direction.

**I'm not saying that there isn't currently good music being made**

What has changed that has caused, this is it, we're ok with what we have!"" (drumstep/minamilst-Autonomic developments notwithstanding). Listen to most mixes from the last 5-10 years and it's pretty much the exact same spectrum of styles and beats.

Case in point: Virus Recordings. Have they been remixing the same tune over and over for the past 10 years? So ironic considering how forward-thinking Wormhole was deemed to be at the time. Or, Dillinja, Ed Rush/Optical et al really have nothing left to prove to anyone, but still, the quality drop is pretty sad. Hospital Records is another one. They seem to have nailed the liquid formula a good 10 years ago, but since then pumped out the same tune for hundreds of releases.

Again, but if there are, this is not coming across in the average mix or radio show from recent times, which indicates to me that boundary-pushing producers are in the vast minority.

What has changed that has caused this?

**[Reddit Playlister!](http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com)**

Reddit Playlister is essentially a playlist style web page. You pick a Subreddit, and let it do its thing. It’ll auto-switch to the next item in the playlist, it’ll auto-load more items when it gets near the end of a playlist, etc, etc. 

It is loosely inspired by rplayer.co.uk

Despite supporting YouTube links, so that question wasn’t entirely serious, but hopefully you catch my meaning)

**The main features**

    - Load items from a few selected subreddits
    - Two of the more common link types are supported:
        - YouTube
        - Soundcloud
    - Standard playlist/playback controls
        - Play/Pause/Stop/Next/Prev
        - Volume
        - Seek bar
    - Ability to change quality of YouTube links (defaults to HD720 for better audio quality)
    - Purdy CSS stuff (with low quality mode for unsupported/slow browsers)
    - Data fetching is performed by the user’s browser via YQL using jQuery
    - Functions in IE6/IE7/IE8/IE9, Chrome, and Opera
        - !! May not look quite the same in IE6-8


If it’s useful to you, or have any ideas or anything like that.

Eventually, though.

1353380391.0,13hl3r,Thoughts on recent discussions about heavy/early downvoting,wwwrun,50,14,27,"Hey /r/dnb'ers

we have a lot of subscribers by now (just hit 18k) and also lots of traffic (by now up to 100.000 pageviews/month) in our beloved subreddit but a very small amount of up-/downvoting going on in relation to it. I don't know why the people use upvotes so sparingly on quality content but one thing is for sure - the downvotes in this subreddit have a relatively high voteweight. Lots of good stuff (including e.g. handcrafted mixes from the community members themselve) does not make it up front because it is crushed by one early downvote hammer

     -

I know it is difficult when it comes to discussing music and taste of music because there is so much emotion attached to it. Probably we all know the feeling at a rave when its not only the particular artist [insertyourmostfavouriteartisthere], the crowd is going crazy and you just think: This can't in any way get any better at all - can it? And then you come home, sleep for the rest of the morning, head to /r/dnb and submit your tune you remembered from last night thinking this is soo good it has to receive at least 100 upvotes from me alone. And then you get a single downvote a lot of the people don't see it at all and later you might even delete the post because you think *that* track has not deserved to vegetate in your submisson history with not a single upvote.

     -

And even only within this colourful subgenre we all got to know by now that tastes of our fellow /r/dnb crew diverges heavily. So if you didn't think that this is a reasonable comment/post at least try to explain why. This is a community - try to *discuss* things. And when you and your discussion partner realize that you come to the point that it's about individual taste - thats fine, shake your virtual hands and go to the bar to get a drink. But the most important thing is that OPs shallow feeling of submitting OC and immediately getting downvotes and not knowing why is gone. And although the original post might not have received masses of upvotes, OP decides to post again in the future. And that is in the end what we all want to have here at best - a lot of fresh content.

     -

I love seeing - and this happens from time to time - that mediocre content gets early downvotes

     -

This is reddit with all its up- and downboat glory and

     -

Sure, not only because we are conditioned to do so while quickly flicking through the frontpage of /r/pics or /r/funny. But in this case only you as a community can step in and react accordingly. We had the content-type related discussion here a lot and I think we as a community are handling it pretty well by now, now it's time to think about (step 2) *how you react* to dnb related content where youre brain tells you ""I clearly don't like it"" (step 1).

     -

This whole wall of text is not about any order or a mandatory rule but merely food for thought. A downvote is unconstructive criticism - try to be constructive. **Especially when it's the first downvote.**

     -

Thanks for listening and good night.

1358948498.0,174d3s,/r/dnb sunday sessions NEWSFLASH! /r/edmradio cooperation - and we need you!,wwwrun,43,7,11,"Hey /r/dnb'ers

our biggest change we had since the last show - we are streaming now in parallel to edmradio.org (run by redditors from /r/edmradio) where you can tune in as well if you only want to enjoy the audio stream or if you e.g. have to rely on a slow internet connection! Our site will stay online of course providing the videostream as usual.

But more importantly: The plan for the future is to open up more as well and incorporate more of you reddit DnB DJs. Therefore /r/edmradio has made a huge step into your direction and dedicated the whole Sunday now to /r/dnb! That means there are a lot of 1+ hour slots to be filled before and after our show which is usually airing at 9pm UTC/GMT. Maybe we could start with someone from Australia, before we come up with some US DJs? And Icecast broadcasting is really easy too, so head to edmradio.org and reserve yourself a slot for the next Sunday! Another option would be to contact the /r/edmradio mod /u/polyponic directly via a reddit message or in the #edmradio chat room - I bet he'll be gladly helping you out in any organizational matters. He approached us with the idea by the way - and was also the winner of the first /r/dnb MotM contest with a fantastic mix - remember? :P

Maybe someone of you noticed already - the /r/dnb FAQ is now transformed to the new Wiki-style format

Also a special slot will be reserved for the Mix of the Month winners - we'll keep you updated on this.

Another goodie: edmradio has an archive

Also

And our video streaming server is by far not at it's planned load factor so tune in when it's that day of the week again :)

Last but not least - preview on the next session #12: More guests &amp; unreleased choons!

Stay tuned!

I've been wanting to make this list for a while and finally I'm gonna do it tonight cause I can't sleep. I've seen quite a few threads basically asking how to keep up with the DnB scene. I think one of the best ways to do this is by following DnB promotional channels. This is a list of some of the promotional channels that I've subscribed to over the past year. Keep in mind that I am excluding label channels and feel free to link to more channels in the comments and I'll add them to the list.

His favorite artists are Pendulum, Netsky, Hybrid Minds, Rameses B, Fred V &amp; Grafix.

Back in 2001 I heard a DnB song that got me into the genre.  Unfortunately I've never heard it since and every now and again it pops back up in my memory and bugs the hell out of me.  The most distinctive thing I remember is the intro.  It had strings

##The [masta plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-0elSJtSlo)

It's a Friday so anywhere we meet is going to be rammed (hilarious..I know) because of after work drinkers so I'm going to suggest [The Green](http://www.thegreenec1.co.uk/) because 1) it's easy to find (unless you're peterfile343) 2) it's close to the station &amp; fabric but far enough away to not be completely packed 3) you can stand/sit outside on the street and they don't bother you. Met Office says no rain Weds/Thurs so hopefully that'll stick out for Friday..

When I started mixing in 2007 I used to drop my mixes into the dnb record shop run by local promoters to get feedback and maybe a chance to play - every time they'd say ""yeah you're on the right track

I moved to a new city for about 18 months a couple years back and the local scene there were much more warm and welcoming. They didn't care what your social status was

Since moving back I've had no luck
I've been invited to play with my home city's local crew on their podcast

Just wanted to share the good news. I'm sure there are a lot of you in the same boat as me

Oh and if you have any tips for how to break into a local scene as an unknown DJ then please
