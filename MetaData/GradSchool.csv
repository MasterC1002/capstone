I've contacted one of the mods

Thanks to all of you who put ideas into the [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EyXGYzZ273FeSNMERD1qisuszN5uG4ZS9m7VSiEXRpw/edit?usp=sharing) regarding topics you would like to find in a FAQ. I am keeping this document open for all of those who still want to contribute this way. Here is the [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EyXGYzZ273FeSNMERD1qisuszN5uG4ZS9m7VSiEXRpw/edit?usp=sharing). It's open for editing to anyone with the link.

**This being said there is another way you can contribute**. I would set up another document for those of you who wants to help creating the content. We come from different countries (most from U. S. but still) so it would be perfect if at least few of you could contribute, in that case it would be really hard to keep everything in a good flow without any mess. When document is closed and everyone is using gmail names and so on, it's easy to peer-review everything and discuss issues / changes. After finishing, or when we decide that we have something valuable to show, we will reformat this into a Reddit FAQ style and publish for the whole community.

**How you can contribute?** Simply PM me with your e-mail so I can add you to the document editing team.

**What I will get?** Satisfaction and incredible IF among our community. Every contributing author will be acknowledged!

1360286247.0,183ow1,Advice I wish I knew at the start of my PhD program,eridu1983,132,11,51,"This has been done before

Career:

- Whenever attending seminars or reading articles

- Grad school is going to be hard. There are many months that are going to suck. Try to not get too high or low emotionally. 

- Most professors (especially PI's) are not normal people. Many achieved their positions through Darwinian fitness and had to be tough to survive. I'm generalizing, you can prepare yourself. 

- Apply for as many grants as you can. The first few I applied for were not considered for funding

- Try as hard as possible to get involved in side projects. If they take off, its a way to expand your skill set.

- I have viewed post-doc positions as a part of the academic career track. If you have doubts about becoming a Prof


Personal:

- Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. If its going to take 6 years to graduate

- Results should not determine your level of happiness. Your experiment caught on fire at 5 pm on Friday? Oh well

- You are not an impostor. You're there for a reason and your opinons are as valid as any Nobel laureate. At conferences

- Be mature if you date within your grad school program. Gossip (and people) get around.

- Remember

 I am a PhD candidate in Egyptology in Australia. I would have to agree that it is one of the most niche and subjects and renders me not hire-able to many employers. Nevertheless I love it, especially since the revolution and there's a good chance that all I'll ever be able to do is teach high school.

I started off pretty shaky, sure, however I was so busy writing an only partially related article for publication and book chapter on the same topic that I forgot to do my PhD for, ooh, a year there perhaps.

I was about 18 months in when everything collapsed around me and I had a complete fucking nervous break-down. I cried for hours almost every night

I ended up needing medication and therapy, they are woefully ineffective, at least at my university in Australia.

I went to counselling at uni first, but I was depressed about EVERYTHING, of course I blamed stupid shit at home. At no time did the counsellor tell me that a) she thought I was depressed and b) to go to a doctor. I have recently found out through requesting my records that I was showing 'signs of depression in the severe range.' My counsellor never told me this.

After a few sessions in which I cried the entire time, there is no sick leave for stress' and my 'but I can't, I just can't' over and over. And tears, so much crying. I would burst into tears the minute I got there and cry until I left. I re-iterate, at no stage was I told to go to the doctor.

In the end my mother told me to go to a doctor. She has suffered from depression and realised what was up. I was staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning staring at reddit or stupid TV shows. Within 5 minutes in the doc's office I had a referral to a psychologist

When I think back on the weeks I wasted seeing a counsellor from the university I am angry at the time I lost, but I thought about driving off the road every day. 

What stopped me from doing something awful to myself was my doctor, bless him, who tells me in the most matter-of-fact way 'I would not have told you to apply if I did not think you could do it. You must simply work a little each day and be happy with whatever you have done. It is like exercise, you must get back into it slowly.' Most of all I have to go easy on myself and stop berating myself for the time I've lost. It's gone, move on and do the best you can with what you have left is what I say to myself every day.

I am not saying that you should not trust the facilities given to you by your institution, or overly stressed, have feelings of self loathing or poor self esteem or feelings of being trapped and doomed to fail, YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I wish I had known how common this is, I would have sought help sooner.

Remember a PhD is a stressful thing

So I thought I might put some suggestions out there that perhaps someone will find helpful.  Standard disclaimer: These are my opinions and are not representative of my program (though I have discussed this with the chair of the admissions committee

**Things about your Statement of purpose:**   
Your SOP should tell me at least a little bit of why you want a PhD, since you are applying to a research based PhD program, you better have research experience that is directly applicable to this field.  If you don't, don't apply, work for a few years, then apply.  You could have the best grades in the world, but if you don't know what it's like to do bench work day in and day out, make sure you tell me at least a bit about your research and how doing it has helped prepare you for grad school.   

Don't explain to me why basic science is awesome, we already know.  Tell me why YOU want to do this research, where YOU want to go with it, and what part YOU think you might do in the future of science.  If you're not really sure, that's fine, but give us some ideas on why we should let you in over someone else who has a very clear goal in mind with earning a PhD.   
Also, so does everyone else, and if that's all you think you're coming here to do, you best have already made contact with that group.  But if you think there are a number of labs you could see yourself working in, tell me.  I want to know that you've considered which labs you think you'd be happy in.

**About your grades:**
If your grades dropped from A's to B+'s one semester, if your grades are all A's and/or B's, please don't focus on your grades at all, they are fine.  Likewise, a small smattering of C's will likely not sink you, but if you started weak, address it.  If you had a shitty semester for a legitimate reason

**About your CV:**
Learn what should go on a CV.  Don't put stuff on there to fill space.  Make it pertinent.  Nothing about high school.  And really learn what order stuff should go in.  Your education and research experience should be near the top.  Your work to save the baby seals, and then try to emulate it.  Or better yet, as your TAs.  They'll have a lot less stuff on theirs, and might give you a better idea of what a more minimal CV might look like.

**Words and their order:**
Have someone proof read EVERYTHING you turn in, see if you can use these services as an alumni.  If you work in a lab, ask your PI and others higher up the food chain for suggestions.  

**Letters of recommendation:**
If you are sending in more than 3 LORs, you might want to reconsider including it, especially if it is instead of a LOR from one of your research experiences.   
ASK your letter writers if they can write you a STRONG letter of support.  If they can't, you might need to address why no one can write you a strong letter, and then address those issues before applying to grad school.  LORs can make or break your application.  We are considering people who have weak SOPs, but incredibly strong LORs.  The reverse doesn't really happen.

I happily provided him with a free copy and he was very appreciative.  He later sent me a request to connect on LinkedIn

I hadn’t heard anything from him for the next couple years until today when I received an email saying that because I helped him out with his thesis by providing one of my articles, and I am a fourth coauthor on it.  The paper is an experimental evaluation of a cybercrime literacy program for high school students in Nigeria.

So I’m wondering what the hell is going on?  Why on Earth would they bother to give me credit for a paper I had no hand in creating?  They want me to proof read and submit it somewhere.  It also seems weird that they would want me to decide where to submit it for review…

Before anyone thinks ""Nigerian scam"" here are some additional details-
I copied some text from the manuscript they sent and it matched nothing on the internet.  It would seem like a lot of trouble to write a 30 page paper for this.  The RTF they sent doesn’t have any scripts in it that I can find.  The scheme would also have to span the course of two years, that is why they cited me.  So they should know there is no chance I would be dumb enough to wire some advance fee.

TLDR: Got a request from some Nigerian researchers who want me to coauthor and help submit for peer review a manuscript they wrote that I had no substantial hand in creating.  Is this weird?

1361970022.0,19bp45,TAing a horrible lab. Advice requested.,,40,6,23," This is my first semester as a TA and my first experience with my Uni's undergrad labs.

Issues:

* This is a physics lab. Each lab is 2 hours and 15 minutes long. At the start of each lab my advisor comes in and talks (preaches) to the students about how they need to read the manual and be prepared. She talks for 45 minutes of their lab time! She is not teaching them anything she just enjoys the ego boost of having the attention of 30 people. Did I mention she does this for every single lab session? She wastes all their time.

* After she leaves the students have 1.5 hours to complete a lab. Each lab is really 4-5 full length labs. (For example we did inelastic and elastic collisions on the same day. They needed to get 8 tables worth of data!) The students never finish on time. She forces them to come in later to finish throughout the week to get all the data. Some of my students have spent 15 hours collecting data for a single lab. It doesn't help that she orders all the worst equipment that breaks constantly so she can get a deal.

* Another problem I have is that each lab has a 60-80 page lab report. That's right! 60 pages for an undergrad physics lab! My students say this is their hardest class even though it is only worth 10% of the actual lecture grade. They spend so much time on these horrible written reports because she has a 247(!) page outline of what she expects on blackboard. I'm not kidding


I don't know. I feel like the students are not learning anything. I feel like I am being immoral. They are paying so much for such a shitty experience. I feel like such an asshole saying ''I guess you will have to come in for a few hours on Saturday.'' They shouldn't have to..argh. If I was a student I just wouldn't do the lab and take the 10% point loss. Some of the lecture professors actually give enough bonus so that the students who take that route can still get an A.



Any advice? I am leaning toward just not doing it and hoping I can get an RA spot soon.


I typed this on my phone. I am sorry.

I have brought it up with my department. They basically said  ""we are aware this is an issue. She came in and took charge and we let the lab situation get away from us...she has been here for 25 years...""

During the call, and I scaled it back to an hour or two per week during the school year (relatively normal hobby time like sports or non-academic reading).

I feel sick to my stomach right now. I've worked hard all year to pass the comprehensive exam - it's the major hurdle that prevents first year students from really starting on their own research and doing ""PhD things."" I missed a few questions and need to make those up, then those two bombs got dropped on me. It's like I took one step forward and got knocked back nine steps. 

Each student's exam is discussed by all professors in the department. This is also the time they discuss work ethic and the potential of the student. When my exam came up, oontzoontz isn't interested in a PhD and spends too much time DJing) or more as a question (e.g., is oontzoontz interested in continuing his PhD?) 

The one redeeming factor that came out of this is that my advisor said on his conference call that he didn't see anything from our lab's point of view (my department has 3 labs

Now I feel like the ball is in my court but I'm not sure what to do. I need to pass the exam first - that's a given. Do I somehow prove to the professors in the other labs that I'm interested and cut out for a PhD? Do I ignore them and just keep doing my work in my lab? Should I seriously stop having hobbies outside of school? 

I want to vomit. 

Edit: my advisor and I have a very good idea of who made these comments. I've been advised to poke my head around these professors' offices more and talk about my work, even with my external hobbies. Even though I was not instructed to do so, I have personally made it a goal to not mention my hobbies at all in school - I figure I'll play it safe for a while.

I have never had a grad adviser/research adviser in this way.  My questions for you are:

1. Is this a fairly normal thing?  I want to make it clear that I can't think of any creepy sort of ulterior motive to this


2.  Is this invitation likely to be more of a formality?  This professor is out of town for research in an area tangentially related to mine

Unfortunately, I lost a little bit of steam when my projected shifted from something amazingly interesting to more of a methods project/full-time troubleshooting endeavour. After a whole year of failed experiments, I started to wonder if I should switch fields just so I could scrap the project.  I started working mostly in the evenings, as well, because I feel less pressure to rush through my experiments in an empty lab. 

Today, he told me he thought I might not be cut out for science at all because I have lost my motivation to overcome obstacles. He also suggested that if I wanted go get past this setback I would need to ... well, try harder, pretty much. He told me I needed to waste less time mucking around in the lab and come up with a solution to my problems, or just throw in the towel already. He asked me to let him know by the end of the week whether or not I wanted to drop the degree, graduate and switch career paths or stick with science. 

I absolutely want to stick with science! If he does not want to accept me as a PhD student after my MSc, because the results I obtain are pretty pathetic whatever way you look at it.

I love my field and want nothing more than to be able to have a decent job teaching the subject and widening students views of the world. When I was in undergrad in Richmond, which I was aware of and kept in check. My close friends there helped. Then I moved to northern Virginia for my Master’s degree.

Halfway through my first semester I ended up having something akin to a nervous breakdown after severely fouling up a paper proposal for my Society and Education class because I did not know what was expected. I ended up curled in an upright fetal position on the couch with a bottle of bourbon. (I’ve since had to completely cut out alcohol, even with last year being a year of hell with a roommate I’ll call Tan, who I would refer to as scum if that wasn’t an insult to honest algae everywhere. I was able to mostly keep it under control. Though, looking back, I can see it getting somewhat worse as last year, and my association with Tan went on. To make this worse, I’ve not been able to establish a close group of friends for support like I had in undergrad and most of those friends have gone on their ways and keep up with me online. The one person who tries is my girlfriend, so there’s only so much she can do for me.

It's even worse now that I'm ABT and writing a thesis proposal. All of a sudden I'm the only one expected to keep myself to task. All of a sudden the worst possible judge of my progress has become the paramount evaluator. I just wish there was something I could physically attack and get it over with. And that thought makes me remember how disabled my two ACL replacements in my left leg have made me in terms of my former skills as a martial artist and the entire thing circles around like a shark waiting to take a bite out of me. I’m not sure if this is depression

It's been two months since I've been able to write anything without feeling akin to an utter fuckup. I’ve been periodically dropping in this hellishly negative apathy at best when whatever this is hits and want-to-curl-up-in-a-ball-til-the-world-rights-itself with the occasional dash of short temperedness on the edge of either wanting to scream or cry in the darker times. I feel rather normal most of the time but it doesn't take much to push me into a feeling of dull apathy. University counseling services didn't help since I'm rather withdrawn about this stuff and the therapist was not proficient at teasing things out of me. :( Am I alone in this? What can I do?

Things didn't get done in time, my adviser who was the head of the department ended up hating me, and I ended up doing a lot of stuff on the sidelines because I was terrified I wasn't going to have enough material for the PhD.

Finally the time to start writing came and lab stuff was not finished
At that point I was extremely disappointed

So I wrote the stuff, what is there, lacks originality and impact in the field. They decided that since its lacking in that area, the format needs to be perfect, so I have to move some text around, fix the references and rewrite the discussion .

I am now feeling like shit. I don't want to do anything. On top of it all I was unable to secure a position in the field after my PhD was handed in, since my chances in the field are close to 0 due to the relationship with my former boss, the lack of opportunities in the area and personal situations which prevent me from moving away from the area.

I am at a loss, if what I needed was to be more forceful with the bureaucrats or what? I feel like a loser when I see the newly published articles of my competitors, who used an older technology than I was using, but got much farther than I did and reached the goals I had intended to reach when I started my PhD.

Although all my life I have dreamt of teaching and researching, I got out of there real fast, not without trauma, lawyers and really bad times).

I've been looking for jobs in the private industry and presented myself well, but no experience in X field.

I am not sure what to do, I feel like I would be at the pinnacle of mediocrity.

Background: I'm potentially starting my sixth year in a PhD program in Comp Sci.  I'm through all of the diagnostic and comprehensive exams and coursework

Three and a half years ago, which I work full time.  Three weeks ago my wife gave birth to our first child.

A large part of the reason why I went for the PhD to begin with was to avoid industry because I wasn't sure I could ""hack it"" (I had gone straight from bachelor's to master's without a ""real job"").  Turns out, I got the highest possible grade).  

A secondary reason was because of pressure from my parents, in large part because HE left his Master's program with one course left to go, and feels like it haunted the rest of his life.

Before I took this job in industry, I didn't *really* enjoy being an instructor like I enjoy actually working in industry, so I'm not really sure if I desperately want to be a professor some day.

But really the driving point in this post is this: I want to be there for my son as much as I can, but I wouldn't mind crowdsourcing some opinions from people who might have seen others in the same position I am, and have seen what happened to them as a result of whatever path they chose.

This has little to do with my academics (3.95 GPA) or research (slow, and the incoming students with me were 1/2 international and 1/4 PhDs with families already, the other 1/4 came from the school so they have established friends already. You can see where this is going. 


I've struggled mightily to establish a peer circle. The postdocs in my lab are 30+ and international students, grad association socials, inviting my peers for meals, but it's just not working. Coupled that with how much I dislike this area, and I'm pretty miserable.

Just wanted to kind of vent to a group of individuals who have a clue what I'm talking about.  It is one thing to discuss comp exams and the pressures associated with them with people who aren't/haven't been grad students

I started grad school in Fall 2010, had completed a successful professional paper, etc. so this came out of left field for me.

The expectations prior to the exam were vague, only to have the comp over Labor Day Weekend.  The first time I took the exam I had seven days to answer three questions of my choosing out of three groupings.  The second time it was the same format but only three days due to a change in the department for all students taking comprehensive examinations.

Needless to say

Took the exam, then 45, finally 50+ days later I received notification I PASSED.

I am elated right now.  Staring down the fear of complete failure and having wasted the lat two years of my life was incredibly terrifying and I had even gone so far as to tell myself I hadn't gotten the degree so I wasn't setting myself up for a huge emotional let-down while already unemployed.

Much like last time

**Know your reader**  This is something that I think is incredibly important in writing in general.  Know who you are writing to.  And I don't mean this in the incredibly literal sense.  Sometimes, there are a number of things you can safely assume.  You can safely assume that the majority of people reading your application are professors (and perhaps a few people like me, upper level graduate students).  This means they are highly educated.  They do research and teach for a living.  And your application isn't the first they've seen.  They know science.  They know it well.  And they read A LOT of it, both shitty and stellar.  They've also heard just about every story in the book.  You, most likely, are not a unique snowflake.  Sorry.  That's life.  Odds are, you are part of the middle of that bell curve.  This is ok.  So are most of the rest of us.  We aren't going to be impressed by your pipetting skills.  A single summer of research isn't anything special.  And don't try to wow me your grades.  With few exceptions, you'll be a good scientist

**Don't piss your reader off**  One of my first professors here in grad school is fond of saying this.  There are many ways you can interpret this, worked and put yourself into and through college (had one of these).  There are graceful and professional ways to detail dropping out of dental school and finding your heart in research (had one of these too).  And there are appropriate ways to mention that English is not your first language.  But don't tell me you're special because no one in your family did science and you had to find this path on your own (sorry chump, but the first paragraph of your SOP had me ignoring the rest of your application).

**Get things in on time**  I didn't realize how important this one was for my own applications.  I figured as long as things I had direct control over were in on time, weren't a good fit, or we just didn't feel needed to be here.  Wed we discussed the next 60+ or so for whom materials had arrived after the due date (transcripts, LORs, or GRE scores).  Today we discussed the remaining 60+ applications, both complete and incomplete.  If your application wasn't complete by today, oh well, even with missing transcripts, and by next Wed we'll have made our final list of who gets offered interviews in the first round

Here's the other thing about being on time though.  The applications I read on Sunday and Monday?  I was thorough.  I was patient.  I was kind.  I was understanding.  The last 10 this morning?  I'm tired.  I was brutal and ruthless.  I voted to cull more people today than either of our past two meetings.  You want to be at the top of the pile not necessarily because you want to be near the top, but try not to make it be you.

**Spelling and grammar**  Last, than you also have access to a computer to spell check your statement.  I've read at least a handful of applications that it was obvious were not even put through one round of spell check in word.  This does not bode well for your application, especially if you're #180 and one of your letter writers still hasn't sent in their letter for you.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/n6vy0/some_suggestions_part_2/

She also made it clear that she wants us to hold students to a very high standard when grading. Following the first assignment, I've already received one very nasty complaint from a student claiming that I ""cheated him"" on his grade. He was unable to provide any evidence of this, and considering that I wrote a paragraph of useful feedback after every answer on his assignment, I feel that his claim is very unfair.

It wasn't until I got to the wash basin and saw a girl in a hijab that I realized that I hadn't seen any urinals - ""Oh shit! I was in the women's room"".

I turned to the girl standing next to me to confirm my suspicion, beet red from embarrassment. Thankfully, nobody called the cops on me (not that I had any malicious intentions whatsoever).

I am 1.5 months away from completing my program (Doctor of Nursing Practice) and have some questions about moving onto the next stages of life. 

Being a graduate student has slowly given me something I had never experienced before - anxiety. I should clarify that it is fairly mild and it does not interfere with my daily life. It does however give me a persistent feeling that something else needs to be done and that there is something I am missing. I can't enjoy ""downtime"" and over the last few weeks I can't sleep very well. 

I'm not seeking advice on how to deal with anxiety - I have the background and resources to answer those questions. I just want to know - does it go away? For those of you that have finished grad school and are gainfully employed - do you still have those nagging feelings that started as a grad student. That grew as a TA and RA?

I'm not anxious about the future. I've already found a job that pays extremely well and I'm looking forward to the work and its environment. I am not remotely anxious for what the future holds. I just want to know if the feelings brought on by grad school will go away. 

My doctoral defense is the end of this month and I am simply hoping that after getting that expensive piece of paper that says it is all done  that it really is all done. Is the rumor of a ""normal life"" is really just a rumor?

(These three are extremely interrelated at my university; I promise that it makes some kind of sense.)  She believes that there is leverage to require amended behavior on his part, and has worked with this exact situation before.  If she is correct, I would like to continue my PhD work.  If he is unwilling to work with me, I will take a master's degree and seek a clinical research position.  Next week I am meeting with the ombudsperson again as well as my PhD program director to take the next step.
I appreciate the support I am being offered here.  The ombudsperson told me that this problem is extremely common and faculty tend to take for granted that there are no consequences to their behavior.  This is not true, have a professional investment in mediating issues.  There are enforcement mechanisms in place to handle these issues.

As a result of the poor economy, all that is offered to grad students now are Direct Unsubsidized Loans at 6.8% fixed interest compounded quarterly. The compounding of interest starts immediately (unlike for the Subsidized Stafford Loans where the compounding of interest starts after you finish or leave graduate school). I crunched some numbers and you end up with a debt that is 1.4 or 1.36 times the amount borrowed (based on whether the loans are given out on a yearly or semester basis, respectively). Those numbers are pretty significant considering that you just graduated, haven't worked a day, and already have a debt that is a whopping 1.4 or 1.36 times what you borrowed.

Are there any private loans that you would be better of taking compared to the above? I'm leaning towards the fixed interest side (since who knows what you'll get yourself into by taking adjustable rate loans). Anyone else in a similar situation? Any info/advice would be helpful.

**Interviews in the biomedical field**

The biomedical field (and I would imagine some/many other sciences) has something that humanities often don't: money. What this means for prospective PhD students in the biomedical sciences is that programs can afford to fly out some number of students a year, or students that they feel are well suited for their program. We interview 40-50 students every year with the expectation of getting 10-20 incoming new students. 

If you have been invited out for an interview, and all the food and transportation costs associated with having you there for a weekend. If you have been invited, and they are willing to lay this money out for you, THIS IS A GOOD SIGN. If they aren't *really* interested in you, they aren't going to spend the money on you to do this. For some programs, this is more of a chance to recruit you. They already know they want you, so they're going to try to impress you and hope that you'll accept their offer. For other schools, the reality is somewhere in between. For my program

**How does an interview weekend work?**

The same basic theme applies to many larger umbrella biomedical programs. They'll fly you in Thu night. If you get in early enough, what they've liked and disliked. If there is a faculty member you'd really like to meet and didn't get the chance to, ask your student host, they might either know the professor directly, or know someone in their lab that you can talk to. Friday night will likely be dinner with all the prospectives and all their hosts at some restaurant in town followed by some night time activity.

Saturday is often used for more social/see the town activities. We start off with breakfast and a Q&amp;A panel. This is the opportunity for applicants to ask any questions they might have that haven't been answered yet. We usually talk about rent, etc. The rest of the day is usually used for activities. We usually offer a trip to one of our local breweries and something else non-alcohol related. Kind of a 'hey, there are fun things to do in this town.' We also usually do a driving tour of the city so we can show people what the city actually looks like, and aim to drive by a few areas students tend to live in. Saturday evening is generally the faculty dinner, where all the current students, all the applicants, and many of the faculty gather at a faculty members house to have dinner. At this point, or corner grad students of faculty members you haven't met. Saturday night for us has rotated some. Last year we took recruits bowling. The year before we had game and movie night. And then Sunday

**What do I wear?**

If you are given a suggestion, go with a nice pair of jeans, a nice shirt, and something other than sneakers. Here's the key though: know the weather. We invite students out in February. February is also one of our coldest snowiest months. So we do actually tell recruits/interviewees that jeans and snow boots are perfectly acceptable, because most people don't know how to dress warmly in business casual, and well, we are a casual bunch overall. If you show up in a suit, but expect people to look at you weird. Likewise

**What's the whole recruitment vs interview thing?**

Some programs used to do out right admission, and kept lighting stuff on fire. Seriously. So in reality we call this an interview weekend. We want to make sure you don't set off any red flags. On the other hand, we internally call it recruitment. We want to wine you and dine you and show you a good time. Pull out as many bells and whistles as we can to show you how awesome we are and that you should really come here. But again, it can be really hard to gauge which type of weekend you've been invited to.

**What should I be asking on my interview weekend?**

There are tons of lists out there, or are thinking of having kids while in grad school, ask about this. Some programs are incredibly flexible and realize that students lives don't stop just because they are a grad student. Other programs don't seem to get this (yet). Ask. Ask about what is important for you. 

But you might also want to ask some more general questions that will help you figure out your decision in the end. How many labs do I get to choose from? How does funding work? What do prelims/quals look like at this program? Do a lot of students drop out? Do the current students seem *happy*? (This one really struck me on two of my interview weekends. One school I visited, this is fine. But at another program, the students genuinely looked and behaved happy.)

**How do I make my decision at the end of all this?**

There are many different ways to do this, interviewed at 5, but really only considered two. One of the programs I interviewed with was really anti-teaching, and while I don't know (still) if I want to teach or not, I knew I wanted the experience. Pay attention to these things. They'll help you make your decision.

**Misc.**

If you don't drink, don't drink on your interview weekend. Etc. You will likely find a heavy drinking culture in many programs. Know that this is pretty much par for the course, but don't feel pressured or feel bad for turning down alcohol if you don't want to drink for any reason. Likewise, if you do drink, and you make an ass of yourself, the current students will talk about it. It might not hurt your chances of getting in, but you won't know that ahead of time.

When your interview weekend is over, anyone who was incredibly helpful to you, the people you interviewed with, etc. Keep them short and to the point. If there is something that you really wanted to follow up on, this is your opportunity. Even if you don't end up going to that school, those people will likely be people you'll run into again in your field.

If you need special accommodations for any reason, and an iceberg lettuce salad with no dressing the next day. Needless to say, that is not the program I'm currently in.

**Summary:**

* Public speaking matters for everyone

* Know your material: Why are you doing what you're doing? How does it fit into the broader context?

* Know your audience: Who are you talking to and what do they care about? Address your audience in terms that are important to them. No one is going to your talk to hear you speak - they are going to learn something they find useful. You aren't a rock star.

* Know your story: Have a focused message and stick to it. Don't do a data dump and don't just recap your paper. Pick one message and make sure every aspect of your presentation supports it.

* Make simple slides without a lot of clutter. If you use technical figures make sure to explain them and highlight what's important.

* Be confident and passionate in your delivery. If you don't believe yourself and care about what you have to say

* Practice as much as possible. 99% of people are nervous and scared about public speaking

Now that I am here though, I can't take it anymore. I have a wonderful boss, I am at a wonderful school, and I have and had droves of people to motivate me and help me when I am down an out. That no longer helps though. Simple fact of the matter is, I pretty much hate science now. I've loved it since I was 4 years old and discovered what it was. I couldn't get enough! Now though, I don't want to look at science, read science, ANYTHING to do with it. It makes me feel sick, how much time all of these people devote to their persuits

I hate chemistry now. I come in to lab with no motivation. I could give absolutely two shits about my work (which I used to love). I don't want to do any of it. I very likely will want to start over if I finish. I have been beat up by life, not that cool ""oh look what I discovered!"" feeling. I just do not care. We will sit in meeting and discuss papers on newly discovered things in chemistry. I sit there and in my head I think ""oh how I just don't give a shit. Who gives a fuck?"". I was not like this before I started grad school. I went to a high school of 2,000, and got the award for the most outstanding chemistry student, and most outstanding senior in science, because of my overwhelming curiosity and drive for discovery. I've had so many support me since I was young, and they (and I) all hoped I'd one day be this world reknowned scientist.

What else am I to do though? I have +100, even though they're deferred right now. Worse yet, I don't want a chemistry job, a lab job, or anything related. I hate this stuff now. School, and work is pretty much the soul source of my depression. Added to life just not giving me anything to look forward to, and my shit neurochemistry

Every job I have ever held I have ended up hating after a while. Now I am seeing that even stuff I once loved, will make me begin to hate and resent it in every way. It's like I am wired to be lazy, a waste of space, and a burden on soceiety, and I am absolutely powerless to change it. I feel like a terrible, terrible person because of this. I have been afraid to tell anyone this because of how terrible it is. I just want to sit in my room, and do nothing. Just browse the internet and do nothing. Forcing myself to work hard just leads me to depression and terrible mental health. I have been fighting through scuicidal thoughts for over a year now. I can't even find the motivation to cook as often, foster friendships.

The longer I stay in grad school, because I honestly want to do nothing. I keep telling myself it will get better. I've been telling myself that since I started grad school. It's been one step forward, and two steps back. Over time, that adds up. I'm starting to just not care about anything. Not one thing at all.

I take time off of pursuing my degree (2 years). During that time, and then re-instated immediately with the stipulation that I need to work with my undergraduate advisor. 

Second go at the UofB, but I get an A. In the summer, I take a full load and get two A's and a B+. After that, I take the fall semester with all A's except for one A-. 

This semester

Looking at this quantitatively, gen-chem, and statistics. As it stands, I have about two years of field research, a year and a half of lab research, and I'm working on a few projects that might get published before applications are due.  

Why do I have poor performance? Girls and depression. I was totally girl-crazy (even though I wasn't too successful) and I was severely depressed. I moved to the UofB because I got kicked out of my fraternity (turned out to be a good thing) and well, I would have done better. Alas, that didn't happen.

Thankfully, but I'm not going to impress anyone by saying that I chased girls. Although, if you're only looking at GPA, I'm a terrible applicant, but I've done a lot to make sure that that I'm a damn strong candidate.

TL;DR: I went to a few schools and had poor performance because I didn't realize what I wanted to do. I took two years off and returned to school

In any event


Thank you for your time and help.

I applied to my doctoral program (Applied Sciences) last year after meeting my adviser at a conference. I got onto her project and into the program with full funding until dissertation time. So happy! 

Throughout my first year

* Adviser hates being a professor and an academic

* Continuing with point above, or physics, none of which engage me or interest me in the slightest (I'm in informal education and biology). 

* Adviser also loudly wishes that she left her program with just the M.S., and she's bullied by other professors. In fact, she is taking on a second position to 'ease her way out of it'. 

* During our rare advising meetings, my family, my cats, etc). She has openly stated that she sees me more as a friend, rather then an advisee or employee. 

* My other adviser has strongly suggested that I leave the program, where I ""can escape the drudgery of academia, make money, and have fun."" They will support my decision if I choose to switch to another department. 

* Other adviser is awful to the other RA in our group; he has failed her on her comps

I'm really upset at this

But my professors are unhappy

Additionally
I'm so confused. I have a meeting with another department chair in a couple of days to see if I can transfer into her program. But what my adviser said rattled me: that she's leaving

When I was in college I wrote an honors thesis through a lab in the genetics department. We actually got some really cool results and decided to publish. I wrote up a manuscript that was almost ready to be submitted, not an ongoing project in the lab). 

Mean while

Ok, she's written the intro by randomly copy an pasting parts of my honors thesis together, and it doesn't make much sense. I give her a bunch of comments and make a bunch of corrections and send it to her. 

Flash forward to this morning: she emails me a draft saying she's submitting **tomorrow**. The draft has not incorporated any of my edits. The disscussion section isn't even *written*. To top it off, she also (presumably) accidentally forwarded me a conversation she was having with another author which says that the reason the data is missing is because that other professor withdrew her name from the paper, doesn't want her data being used in it, and has also vowed to never collaborate with my PI ever again. 

What the hell is going on here? I'm really conflicted about what to do about all this. I'm supposed to be first author on this paper, so I don't really trust her word on it. 

Sorry if this is rambling and full of typos. I'm writing on my phone's safari app since I've blocked reddit from my computer and deleted alien blue while I'm taking my qualifying exams. 

Tl;dr: my college PI wants to submit our paper tomorrow even though it's totally unfinished and also she might be lying to me about missing data. Help?

edit: thanks everyone for their advice. Former (*thank god*) PI has been sending me revisions throughout the day. I may have overreacted slightly, the foundation of the paper is solid and the data and findings are good. It just seems very amateur-ish. She's waiting for further revisions from another collaborator (again whom I don't know, and I'm not sure what his involvement is) on the discussion section. Apparently this guy is good at writing about behavior?

I've asked her to delay submitting it so that I have more time to work on it (she knows I'm in the middle of my quals- why she waited until now to tell me she's submitting it I don't know). She's reluctant to do that because tomorrow is the deadline to be in some memorial publication for her late former adviser

I have emailed the other professor to ask what's up. Maybe it's horribly inappropriate and will blow up in my face

I'm not quite sure how to start this as I just recently admitted to myself how miserable I am in graduate school. This post may seem very jumbled, but the most intense individual I've ever met. I know that there are a lot of demanding, unreasonable, driven people in science, but this man is just crazy. And have you ever noticed how unstable, unsuccessful people are labeled as ""crazy,"" but if you happen to be crazy and intelligent it becomes ""brilliance?"" 

So far, and while I love my friends to death, they're all unhappy too. I feel like a robot. I've sacrificed so much for this lab. I don't have relationships, go to many social events, or even see my friends that often. I good day for me is one where I find the time to eat, and make it through the day without sobbing in the bathroom. It's made me very, very resentful of EVERYTHING. I don't care about my research. I don't care about helping people or contributing something to the field. All I want is to get out with my degree and make money by going into industry. The prospect of pursuing research for the rest of my life actually turns my stomach.

I've never experienced depression like this. My mood swings anywhere from absolute despair over my lack of progress (multiple aspects of my thesis project are not working) to total numbness over my entire situation. I've made appointments with both a psychiatrist and psychologist because I'm no longer capable of handling this on my own. If I compromise too much more of my mental health

I guess I'm putting this all out there to ask: is this normal? Is it possible to rebound from graduate school-induced depression? I'm talking the kind where getting out of bed in the morning is so emotionally painful that it deserves praise. Again,,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,True

When it happens, I have to prioritize my tasks so I'm down to maybe 30 hours a week of productivity.

How do I ask departments if my possible health problems would be a problem?

How do I ask for possible accommodations?

I want to make clear, and did homework for are now at MIT, Los Alamos, Carnegie Mellon, CERN, among others. But my career track got derailed by this health problem. A health problem that only infringes on my productivity at irregular intervals.

Also I'm not very good at ""selling myself"". Someone else in my position might know how to manipulate the grad school bureaucracy to make things work out in their favor, smoking weed with his professor. I'm not that person.

I'm a second year grad student in a science program and I'm about to go through preliminary exams/candidacy/whathaveyou in less than a month. I have clinical depression that's somewhat well controlled if I take my meds and sleep well and don't stress myself out. I was also seeing a therapist until I found that I couldn't find adequate time to travel to their office and do everything else that's expected of me. 

What advice could you give to someone like me who needs time and space to not stress out and break down in order to do a decent job studying for prelims and studying for other exams? 

My main problem is that my advisor needs to see his students in lab or else he thinks they're slacking off even if they're just working at the library. I find lab extremely non-conducive to writing or studying. I also get into depression ruts where I just don't want to get out of bed or even see anyone so when that hits

I know the usual advice would be to sit him down and talk to him but if I knew how to do that without getting the anxiety accompanying my depression I would have done that already. In any case

For what it's worth, that seems to be a no-no for my advisor because I'll get bombarded with emails asking me where I am.

Here's my story, the data I generated while here weren't publishable. Even though I've learned I don't want to do research as a career, having no publishes papers makes me feel like I'm graduating with nothing to show for it. On top of that, I don't feel like I learned any technical skills during my degree that aren't applicable outside of the field I was doing research in, and both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in *Biology* which I've seen called 'the worst of the science degrees.'

During my graduate studies I developed an interest in science editing/writing as a career. Fortunately, as I have no formal training as an editor (no English, technical writing or communications degree), building my CV will take time and likely some volunteer work. It doesn't help that I have no publications under my belt other than my unpublished thesis, and I'm trying to decide how I should make money in the interim.

Part of me is sick of academia and constantly being ""on"" even when I have no work to do--I'm sure most of you are well-acquainted with the feeling of, I don't know, being an office assistant or working at a bar) is going to look bad on my resume and lock me into an unsatisfying career path in the future.

I'm currently an MS student on a fellowship through the graduate division. I was told by advisor that I could switch to PhD without having to earn my MS if I wanted

I suppose my current problem is a lack of people my age or with my goals. Every other graduate student in the program is just here to get a degree, talk about research, do things outside of academics, etc. Nobody seems to have a passion or enjoy the research they do. I'm hoping this doesn't sound snobby... but I really am looking for students who take their graduate studies very seriously and share similar goals or outlook as me and perhaps more students in their late 20's or early 30s even. Is this unrealistic? I'm hoping with a very well regarded program there will be a higher concentration of students excited and passionate about their work, hopefully leading to great conversations or friendships. 

I'm not particularly shy

The proposal is well-written/argued, but most of the work has been done (preliminary data almost published), which is generally a good thing, but in my case means that there is not much left to do in the proposal that isn't already done. If future work presented is not enough to fill 3 years of research, it is enough to fail the student. My advisor isn't worried but both postdocs in my lab have insinuated that I would not pass after I gave a mock oral during lab meeting.

**TL;DR** Suffice it to say, and have now discovered that I will not be awarded my MA degree *at all*. Here I am now - no savings, no access to credit, and a TA salary with an expiration date - with my 10 year (hell, 25 year) plan made invalid. I will not be allowed to continue the PhD and after 2 years of dedicated, outstanding work I will not even have an MA in hand. I want to know if this is something that others have experience with and what they did.

My PhD program was aware that my MA was not in hand when I started and has been supportive as I've balanced my courses, I was unable to overcome my personal problems in order to pass the qualifying criteria to earn my MA. Without my MA in hand by the end of this semester, I will not be qualified to proceed in my PhD program. 

There are no more chances with the MA program I was enrolled in. I have been dismissed from the program. My transcript will still reflect all of my coursework but will not reflect an awarded degree. Nonetheless

I'm terribly ashamed of this. I feel guilty for not living up to the expectations of my mentors. But I know that if I had not suffered the health problems that I did this year, and was known as a bright, respected, and ambitious student in my MA program. I believe that I am well-suited for the career that I have been pursuing and would like to continue to pursue it.

Due to the nature of her PhD research interests (i.e. American literature), Cornell, Yale, Colombia, Stanford etc. ask for demonstration of 2 foreign languages. As Europeans, even to us this seems a little alarming - *fluency in two foreign languages?* I'm currently taking a DPhil at Oxford and had no such requirements - despite being quite comfortable with Ancient Greek/Latin and French/German whenever it is encountered in a critical/scholarly/theoretical context. However, the thought of having to take 2 exams/translation exercises to prove 'fluency' in a language makes me wonder just what they're asking of American PhD's! 

So: do you have to be fluent? Is it intensive? Am I right in assuming, being half-Danish, is competent/conversational in Danish and German, and is working on her French. For (perhaps) obvious reasons, the Danish probably won't be so useful for her grad school application; she's more into Cummings than Kierkegaard.

No one's been able to notice or realize that I don't really have any motivation, and of course the CS professors and other CS students all tell me to stay in it, and physics people tell me to switch.  It's like the CS professors don't realize that it would be better for everyone if I left because I wouldn't use up their money for something that doesn't help them and I wouldn't be wasting my time here.  But they would still want to keep me.  (Seriously it's like breaking up with someone.)  I'm scared to talk to my adviser about it, though, because I know he'd be 10 times worse wanting to keep me.

For various reasons 3 years ago I made a choice to get an M.Phil. in Religious Dialogue from a major European University.  I got good grades

My American public school humanities BA was also funded with debt, while she goes back to professional graduate school in the health sciences.  I have worked since my college internship in the same small company, and I could see myself leaving in a year to try to build a career in either client management or internet marketing... if I weren't so bored with it.

Long story short, but the jobs for religious studies professors are few and far between, and tenure-track positions seem to be incredibly rare.  Plus, a PhD is a 6-year process probably.  My wife and I are close to our family, and after graduation I don't want us to end up in a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, where I'm lucky to have an adjunct position.  Even still, this admissions cycle I have reached out to a number of top-tier religious studies programs and professors in the US

In recent months though I've had the idea to pursue another Masters, perhaps focusing on Eastern European/Caucasian conflict centers.  I'm very excited about 2 years of studying such a topic, but very anxious about the career placement.  MPAs by definition usually get jobs in government, and again, my wife and I want to remain relatively local, and aren't thrilled about moving to DC forever.  Some MPAs do find work in the private sector, but I'm not sure if they do so in international affairs.  And if I'm just going to get a job in marketing, without going back to school!

Finally, studying in a couple of ranked national programs; both provide a part-time option, which might allow us to pay for it as I go.  The financial benefits are obvious, but it seems completely contrary to my childhood dreams of being involved in religious studies, or my adult dreams of working towards achieving religious dialogue.  BUT, if I got my MBA in International Business, maybe I could jump on board with a multinational company and focus on international development, etc.  Sure -- but how many MBAs are in it for the altruism?  I can't pretend to kid myself that I *also* would be doing it for the money.

My first field season is in the books.  Now I have a bunch of files of various types full of data and different bits of papers I am in the process of writing.  I seem to recall a photo of a poster made by somebody whose computer was stolen along with all of his data.  I am also freaked out by the possibility of my computer and/or external hard drive being stolen/broken.  Therefore, otherwise I would just spring for a free service like Dropbox.  Anyway that I can do that without breaking the bank.  Oh, and it would be awesome if the folder updated automatically/appeared as a drive/folder on my (Windows) computer (just 1).  Finally, although I don't need to encrypt anything, it would be nice if the company had a track record of giving a damn about privacy/not data mining.  A cursory search led me to a few options including: Dropbox, Skydrive, Crashplan, SOS Online, Acronis.  Any personal experiences,

Grad school brought up issues and pressures that never came up during my recovery) and now I am struggling to find a lab and interact w people in a normal way and not kill myself.

The research: I'm doing a rotation in a lab in a different school using techniques I've never done before.  The first experiment I did, I should have known, but like I said, I've never done these techniques before so I had no idea.  My mentor pushes me to be self motivated and independent, so I look up protocols for things before we do them now, but he seems to get pissed off that I question him on why his protocol is different - ""it's just the way I do it"" or ""look it up"" is his response.  While he pushes me to be self motivated and independent, he also second guesses everything I do and when I make a ""stupid"" mistake, or 2 identical looking items have been marked in different colors since I started in this lab over a month ago

Because I messed up the first experiment, but everyone seems to really just hate me now that I stopped being friendly and talkative.  People even go so far as to actively avoid me by using a different entrance to the lab/etc.

Everyone in my department and my school also seems to dislike me, I shouldn't care because I'm here to learn, but grad school/science is a social field and it would be nice to have some friends in my program.  Most of the profs dislike me and avoid me as well.  I think/know they respect my scientific abilities (based on feedback I've received), but they know that I'm awkward and very up/down/unpredictable, so both profs and students don't know if I'll be friendly and talkative (overly so), or downcast and depressed and angry and avoidant.  Most of the students also know I had some issues with drugs in my past and think that I used that as an excuse for my year off, maybe they think I'm still using drugs (I'm not, and also stopped eating LSD/shrooms/etc. on a regular basis like I had been doing prior to my year off in order to escape reality - luckily nothing hard like painkillers etc.) and that has also definitely affected my interactions with other students.

Maybe I'm just ranting.  My current plan is to try to be friendly, just to put people more at ease.  I also think I should tell someone (my mentor maybe, or maybe someone else) a shortened version of my issues with anxiety and messing up my experiments and how that lead to my social withdrawal. I'm not sure what to do about other students.  It doesn't help that I look very intimidating and people are scared of me off the bat (was walking to the bus the other day and a mother and her daughter were walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction and the mother grabbed her daughter's hand and pulled her in close and averted her gaze as they passed me).  

This is the first time I've had suicidal ideation (no intent) in a long time.  A part of me wants to give up, my PhD and friends/family etc. really matter to me, but on the other hand, it can be difficult to ignore my belief that even the things that are really important to me are meaningless in the long run and that I can't trust/rely on anybody.

Hers is a class where the grade is almost completely dependent on the project grade.  They have had about three months so far, I had my share of group projects with some issues.  The surprising thing about her group is that most of them fall in the category of ""I just want to do the minimum work required and pass the class.""  I was shocked to hear that this kind of attitude could persist in grad school.  Here is the summary of the people involved:

Person 1: Lives and works full-time in another city about 30 minutes away. Didn't even want to be in this area of study (so why is she?).  Explicitly said she just wants to be done with the project with a minimum amount of work and just get a C.  Comes to no group meetings.  Semi-finished project was sent to her so she could add her part (which she should have had already but apparently didn't) and send to professor for feedback.  This was done three weeks before project due date to give professor a week or so to reply and then they would have a few weeks to work with the feedback.  She sat on it for a week and a half and finally sent it to prof.  Because of this the professor's feedback will be pretty much useless as it will be received (if at all) a day or two before the project is to be presented.

Person 2: Studied the same thing in undergrad but somehow knows almost nothing about it.  When my girlfriend suggests that they have a meeting to discuss things or that they need to do X or Y as the project guidelines state

Person 3: He is quite apathetic about everything.  During a group meeting in our apt, giving the group a speech about how he was worried because ""this project is worth a lot of credit hours guys, let's get serious about it!"".  However, now during my GF's last chance push to make the project actually decent during this final weekend and in the face of all the other group members settling for the project the way it is (hint: not good), this guy reveals that he made plans for a friend to come from out of town to hang out for the weekend!  Consequently, he says he can meet on Sunday evening to work on the project.  The project is to be presented Monday to not only the professor and class, but also to the client for whom they are doing this consulting project!

Personally I have never encountered people like this in a grad school setting.  I feel like they would be common in high school and undergrad.  This makes sense, I expect people in grad school to be a lot more serious, as they had to make a personal decision to leave the workforce and go back to school to study a certain subject. Also they are older so I expect they would be less childish.  I have two questions:

1.  Have you dealt with apathetic grad students who inexplicably don't seem to want to be there and just want to scrape by? How did you deal with working with them?

2.  What advice can I give to my girlfriend to help her save this looming unfinished project and not get a bad grade in this class? It's a six credit-hour class.

I've been wanting to go back to grad school for a long time. I have a good paying job with excellent benefits at a world renown pharmaceutical company. After being in my (manufacturing) department for 4 years

I am clueless as to how to score admissions to a decent program...


-How can I convince potential admissions boards that I am a decent candidate after being out of school for 4 years

-I have a professor who I want to have as an author for my letter of rec. How can I approach him after being out of his radar for so long?

-I did take my GRE's... twice. My score improved only marginally (both scores are pretty average). With a not so stellar GPA (right about 2.98) what are my chances of getting an offer?

-How can I use working in manufacturing as a way to enhance my chances of getting into school?

-Should I find time to take classes at a local university and establish a strong relationship with a new professor?

Some details about my education:

I graduated with a BS in Biomedical Engineering at a west coast university. My grades sucked royally for the first two years due to misguided priorities and partying. Also, I spent a year in a tissue engineering lab during my super-senior year. I had a blast there, and had a great project but was not developed enough to be published. After graduating, I was desperate to find a job, and got into the current situation I am in now. I've determined that although my huge international employer takes pride in having a small-campus/inclusionary culture, those on the research side have a negative perception of manufacturing personnel (high school grads, shift workers,etc.) and will only hire people from the other side for miraculous reasons...

Professor Herp

I am a recent graduate of Derp University's materials engineering program, and whether you would have any openings for new graduate students this coming year.

My intended research area is biomaterials, and nanomaterials.  I have read many of your papers, and your focus on incorporating nanoparticles, developing tissue culture technologies, and exploring new biomaterials closely align with my research interests.  My current ideas revolve around the integration of nanoscale particles into scaffolds as a means of controlled growth factor or drug release, and the combination of nanoscale materials with polymeric materials for scaffolds with unique properties.  Additionally, the focus of my proposal for your class was prevascularization of craniofacial bone scaffolds for increased anastomosis

If it would be possible to speak further about working in your lab

I'm currently finishing up my undergrad career at Michigan State University, working on writing samples, etc.  I ended up applying to 5 schools in December (Brown [PhD], UChicago [PhD], UW-Madison [MA], UIowa [MA], and IU-Bloomington [MA]).  I just received the last of my rejection notifications yesterday.  UChicago accepted me to a Humanities MA after rejecting me from the Cinema &amp; Media Studies PhD,000 and they're not offering funding.  Seeing as I don't have a rich uncle willing to foot the bill

Needless to say, and now I'm sort of at a loss.  I have every intention of applying to programs again next year, but I'm not sure what to do with myself in the meantime.  I have never not been in school.  I've had classes every semester - including summer - since I started college, and the idea of not being in an academic environment is kind of freaking me out.

Those of you who have also been forced to take a year off, which are kind of essential to my field, as well as my sanity.  The local theater shows one movie at a time, and it is always a family film.  The nearest multiplex is 50 miles away, and it's kind of a joke.  But, I digress.  Trying not to move home means getting a real job so I can keep my apartment at school, so that's on my to-do list.  Other than that, what can I do to make myself a really amazing/outstanding candidate?  

I guess I'm just looking for some guidance for other people who were rejected the first time around and had to take a year or more off.

My main motivation for going to grad school was because I wanted to stay around the town my school is at and didn't really want to find a real job yet.  I don't really have any interest in the research I am doing and only really got in because another grad student who TA'd a class I was in saw I did really well and more or less vouched for me when I applied.

I will probably get straight A's in my courses this term

* I don't really have a plan for what I would do if I left.  I really liked being an undergrad and went to grad school because I thought it would be similar and I am not looking forward working a 9-5 job.  Part of me wonders if I just need to get used to working

* I am in the middle of a project that I have been working on since I started research in March.  I am sure I could just up and quit, so I have considered just finishing out this next term if I wanted to leave.  However, my advisor plans to have me start another project within the next month or so, so if I did plan on leaving, I wouldn't want to get started on that.

Should I quit, and not wait until I am a year+ down the road.  Is this possibly a ""grass is always greener"" situation, where working a job could be just as bad?

I understand that as a graduate student I am only eligible for unsubsidized loans. That sucks

So I filled out the FAFSA application, it says that my information will be forwarded to the school, then they will let me know if they need more information, and that I should contact the school with any questions regarding my financial aid package. 

That email was sent to me on April 17th. I have not heard anything from my school since then. Maybe this timeline is normal- if so

I contacted them several weeks ago now to check on the status, but I will definitely be calling Monday to find out what's going on. 


Does it sound like I'm on the right track

Also, but nothing else. Seems to be a rather generous package for a masters student in my field from what I heard during interviews, so I'm not particularly disappointed by that.

I'm applying for my master's in microbiology in specific labs and just got back from an interview weekend where I got to meet with my potential advisor and some of his lab members.

I didn't really get a lot of time to speak with the grad students (since they're all super busy), comments like that don't seem to be reflective of an overall supportive research environment.  I did find out later from the PI that he meets one-on-one with students every other week and has a group lab meeting every other week as well (consisting of 2 post-docs, two PhD students, a lab manager, and ~7 undergrads)... so there seems to be considerable amount of contact (yet the PI admitted he doesn't spend enough time with his students).

I guess I'm wondering... what is considered 'hand-holding'? I keep hearing how different advisors have different advising styles... some may be perfectly content to let their students flounder with little to no direction, then they're not cut out for science) while others think of the thesis topic, design the experiments, are super critical, and so on. So... what exactly is independent?  Is there a line somewhere? Some people may do well in more 'structured' environments with set goals and such while others want complete freedom... but I guess I'm wondering if there is a general level of acceptable/expected independence?

Personally, at least in the beginning (ie help with designing my experiments, choosing a working hypothesis, if I have a question, can get it answered).  Ideally, with time and work, I'll be able to develop into a competent, but frankly I'm not there yet. Am I asking for too much?  Is what I want hand-holding?

TL;DR - PI is trying to convince me to quit grad school. I have never been so sure that I want to, and I'm scared.


Long story short


I am a third year PhD candidate. My main issue is with the PI. He basically thinks that I picked the wrong career, he is a lousy mentor - there is very little intellectual direction given, moreover I am on an ""orphan"" project so that I don't even have others to consult in the lab. I agree that yes, some people in the lab are able to function like postdocs, and admittedly I am not at that level yet. I'm definitely not the star student and I do not pretend to be, either. But... Aren't I here to learn this stuff?!


There is a long backstory of conflict here, but who knows... Now, I already passed the quals. Can they kick me out of the program if he insists that I am unfit? His reasoning is anecdotal and far-fetched at best. e.g. He asked me what I like to read on a saturday night, and I answered current affairs. I love my NPR. Well. He told me that just for that answer, I should not go on any further. That if i were meant to do this, science literature relating to my topic is all I should ever want to read. Of course I read other interesting news articles besides journal articles. Does that mean that I am not tickled by science news, or that I don't like to read the literature, and as the only student in the lab without funding


To be honest, considering the postdoc job market, the smartest thing to do probably WAS to quit. But I carried on,fought hard, and passed. Moreover, I had a very tough committee and I am quite sure that they would have failed me if they saw that I was totally unsuited for grad school as my current boss seems to think so.


I should have done this right after passing my quals


Last time he gave me this talk, maybe I really don't belong here. However, after spending another year in the trenches, I'm more sure than ever that I do belong here and can do great things, if trained to my full potential. I am just hoping that it is not too late to try to find a mentor who can do just that... 


Sorry about ranting... I just need some words of courage from you guys. I will fight with him, long, long years, but I will not give up my destiny because I don't fit someone else's unrealistic idea of what a perfect student should be. Of course, it was my fault that I chose the wrong lave and the wrong PI, but things looked a whole lot different when I first joined.",,,,

I am coming directly from my bachelor's degree. During that time, both to not insignificant journals. My PI was  something of a workaholic but we had a great working relationship, and we have certainly become friends in our own right as well over the years.

I began searching for a PhD program last year and I was given many great options. The institution where I'd been researching put up a ridiculously nice offer for me to stay- an extra $15, the collaboration possibilities, departmental support and my PI's standing in his subfield. Perhaps most importantly, though, I felt very involved and passionate about my research topic and it never felt like a chore to work weekends or nights. 

I was very stressed about making a decision. I got into the #1 program as well as many other ""big names"". I felt a lot of pressure to make a decision, but I am finding myself very angry/upset this summer and feeling conviction-less.

I have a number of concerns

Top 10 School:

I would start over entirely new, the culture of the university tends towards larger labs (at least 15 people) and relatively infrequent contact with PIs (once a week). I would be extremely far from my family with prohibitively expensive airfare.

University I Know:

I could go right back to working on projects I really like and am personally invested in finishing, I work great with my PI although he is on the overbearing side. Our research techniques are not mainstream and it is not likely I will be able to continue it elsewhere. I would be a few hours away from my family by plane.

My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.

I am in my second year of my masters program currently and will be finishing come August when I defend my thesis. About a year into the program I was looking for employment but also told my current supervisor I was interested in a PhD. She said she would take me on if that was the route I decided on. I thought it was a great idea since I could continue off from the project I am working on

Fast forward to about a month ago when I find out I was not awarded NSERC or OGS (yes I am Canadian). I get an acceptance letter for January start but it is conditional. My supervisor says that it was too short notice for her and she could not get any funding for me. She says she may be able to get funding in October and take me on for January start. 

Now I am torn for what to do. Do I stick around for an extra semester and work at a shitty job for a maybe in the PhD position or should I try to find employment? 

To complicate things further my girlfriend just moved from her home town to live closer to me and my best friend who I live with will be screwed and have to move back home if I don't live here. 

I guess I am just frustrated that my supervisor said she would take me on then when she finds out she can't get funding I am left hanging in the wind.

I started a masters in environmental science in June.  My first three months were working on a research project that I thought was going to be my thesis.  It turned out to be completely terrible: the other student on the project was a nightmare, transitioning from a small town to a city, which I've learned I hate), and it made for a really shitty summer.

Fast forward to now.  My advisor has been super helpful, I've come to a few realizations:

* I started this degree with the idea of getting a PhD.  
* However
* Doing research has not turned out to be rewarding at all.  I'm narrowing down my thesis project and the thought of actually *doing* it next summer makes me almost ill.
* The only academic pursuit that I'm actually still enjoying or excited about is writing.  I may be helping my advisor write up some research from a previous project. 
* Before I started, I was filled with apathy. I've honestly never experienced anything but excitement when it comes to that kind of thing.  It was almost shocking.
* Sum all of this up
* Hearing my fellow students talk about career options with a masters in environmental science

I'm still making up my mind. But if I decide that a career in science is not for me, I'd need to **really really** want what's on the other side.

I have just finished up my first year of a PhD in English and I am starting to think about how to shape my career profile for the job market (which is still many years down the road). I have been giving some thought to post-graduate work and was wondering what people think about it? Do hiring committees tend to see it in a positive light or is it looked at as a refuge for those who can't find work? I know that there probably isn't one answer to this

1374127957.0,1ijkfw,I'm not doing that much work in grad school. Is that...OK?,penguinshooray,13,6,15,"Background: I am in a thesis-based masters program in biology. It is a shorter masters since it's a contiguous BS-MS program (so I can graduate with a minimum of 1 year in my MS program). 

My project is a molecular phylogeny of a small group (maybe 15 species). This requires me to sequence 5 markers from 2 individuals from each species. In theory

I finished all of my labwork in the first 4 months of my MS program. Now I am learning the programs required to analyze the data. The actual learning how to use the programs takes the most time

I plan to graduate at the end of this year, especially since I finished all my lab work. I am not worried about writing the actual thesis, since I am a fast writer and the requirements are low (the average is maybe 20 pages). I am looking for part time work right now to fill up my extra time, especially since we're not given funding. I could do a side project, but I didn't get any of the grants I appied for and I have enough to graduate anyways.

The thing is...I feel kind of guilty. There are other students in the program in different areas of biology, since everything I need to do I use my laptop for. Working at home usually means I sleep until 11 and bum around until I decide to work. I am applying for PhD programs now, and I am actually looking forward to a full 40-50 hours a week.

I am currently in my junior year of undergrad pursuing a psych major and criminal justice minor. For the first two years of my college career, etc. Now all of a sudden, I feel like I am not on track at all for grad school. High school didn't prepare me for college AT ALL. Before college, we were told everything we had to do and when to do it, and now in college we are expected to figure everything out by ourselves with little to no guidance from the school. I guess I didn't get that memo and now I feel like I've wasted the past 3 years of my life just trying to get good grades :(
On top of that, not even on campus or do paid internships. I am also limited in opportunities because i have no transportation (i know that sounds like a really lame excuse, but it is a legitimate problem for me...) to do internships or opportunities somewhere else such as our university's main campus.
But does working even really matter for getting into a grad school? I've heard so much recently about how they look at the research you've done. But what does doing ""research"" even mean?? I am attending a smaller branch campus of a good non-ivy league university
