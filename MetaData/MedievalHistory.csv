Like it or not
of medieval studies to the modern world has been the study of late-
medieval war and research concerning its honored but sometimes
uncontrollable child
this popularity has been a basic misunderstanding of the medieval
martial ethic by those who unabashedly serve the code of creative
anachronism and by an ill-informed general public that looks on
medieval warfare as a mild game always conducted according to
gentlemanly rules. To offset these misconceptions that have more in
common with the theme park's view of history than any realistic
historical record
the context of the organized combats that were firmly tied to the
realm of warfare
orbit of the tournament. To carry out this ambitious project
struggles to demonstrate that these bloody exchanges existed within an
evolving code of chivalry that attempted to establish at least a
modicum of order for battlefield and jousting ground alike.

The focus of this work--the late-fourteenth century--is largely
directed toward the era of the Hundred Years War (1337-1453). It is
built on the extensive use of the primary sources of the period (many
of which have been translated into English in the last century). These
include the chronicles of Jean Froissart
de Gomez
document collections associated with great chivalric figures as Edward
the Black Prince
(Boucicaut the younger). Muhlberger's initial direction with the use
of these sources is to demonstrate that the deeds of arms were firmly
connected to the brutal realities of medieval warfare
personified humanizing theories such as just war that the mediator of
medieval society
conflict. By a minute study of both individual and group combat
sparking into existence inside and outside organized military
campaigns
dangerous as the melée that inundated the battlefield. He also reviews
the quite meticulous rules set up for fairness and the maintenance of
personal honor that came into being for the regulation of such
combats. From his extensive reading of the sources
concludes that the evolving codes of martial rules did not come from
the jousting arena
out by small groups of combatants serving in campaigns of much larger
armies. From this ever-shifting environment came both the regulations
and the larger-than-life heroes who were judged by them.

Much of the remainder of Muhlbereger's book centers on how the
emerging ""industry"" of individual and group conflicts were carried out
between French, and Flemish participants. He follows
in great detail the challenge
the means by which fair play was supposed to prevent such conflicts
from lapsing into vendettas pure and simple. The highlight of this
discussion is Muhlberger's meticulous review of the Combat of Thirty
Against Thirty
during 1351. This encounter occurring in a backwater of the Hundred
Years War seemed to stir the imagination of European authors for next
few decades who viewed the small skirmish as a halfway-house of sorts
between the bloodiest aspects of actual warfare and the humane rules
of the tournament. From his discussion of this crucially important
incident of group conflict
such fighting on fourteenth-century societies. With the great interest
that deeds of arms caused
of honor he swore to uphold became a regular topos in chronicles and
romances down to the sixteenth century. This chivalric imprint on
late-medieval society shaped reality--at least among upper-class
circles--when kings tied tournaments to marriage celebrations and
other episodes of high-level negotiation. The most important of these
public combats occurred in 1390 at St. Inglevert near Calais when
three French knights challenged and bested all comers from the ranks
of the English invaders. Though originally a private enterprise
St. Inglevert jousts became a source of French pride and established
the model for ""national tournaments"" down to the sixteenth century.
These popular chivalric norms that eventually became anachronistic in
the face of European warfare increasingly marked by the use of
gunpowder weaponry provided lucrative careers both on the tournament
circuit and in royal service to many a fourteenth-century warrior.
Muhlberger discusses these super-stars in his last chapter.

In all of his chapters
chivalric authors led by Jean Froissart. The inclusion of large
passages from their works in English translation (a feat which
Muhlberger has already duplicated online) is helpful to the general
reader as well as to the military and social historians whose study
focuses on the later Middle Ages. Muhlberger's greatest contribution
in this work
&lt;i&gt;faits d'armes&lt;/i&gt; into a military spectrum that effectively
stretched from the tournament to the battlefield. In some ways
Muhlberger deserves to be placed in the company of the greatest modern
expert on individual and group combat of the later Middle Ages

Infantry
---
* Swordsman - Strong against other infantry and ranged units.  Weak vs. cavalry.  (my research has indicated that the sword is a very flexible and lightweight dueling weapon)
* Axemen - Deals additional damage based on the enemy's health (I have no justification for this
* Maceman - Ignores enemy armor (maces as blunt weapons were more reliant on crushing power and blunt force  trauma
* Spearman - Higher defense anti-cavalry unit (they can carry a shield in their off-hand)
* Pikeman - Lower defense anti-cavalry unit
* Halberdier - Medium bonus vs. cavalry

Ranged
---
* Skirmisher - Deals damage to high health units, to the best of my knowledge, the role skirmishers have played historically)
* Archer - 2 first strikes
* Crossbow - 1 first strike

Cavalry
---
* Raider - Used for pillaging
* Light Cavalry - Bonus vs. ranged and light infantry (just my gut)
* Knight - Heavily armored cavalry unit.  Effectively a juggernaut.  Only truly beaten in efficiency (amount of effort put into making on vs. effort put into killing them).

Siege
---
* Ballista - Bonus vs. heavy units (a ballista generally wouldn't care how well protected you are and heavier targets would be slightly easier to hit)
* Catapult - Deals damage to multiple units (need a generic field weapon)
* Trebuchet - Reduces city defenses faster than other siege
* Siege Tower - Ignores large portion of wall defense

---

In regards to heavy vs. light, estocs, etc.) but players will be able to specialize their forces and these weapons would likely have a place in customization.  Now I know that this list is somewhat large, but do these mechanics more or less fit (within reason) the role these weapons played on medieval battlefields?
