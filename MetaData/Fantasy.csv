I'm a fantasy author.

I'm a father. My son is three.

[I have a show about writing on Felicia Day's Youtube Channel: Geek and Sundry](http://geekandsundry.com/)

I also run a [charity called Worldbuilders.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2012/11/worldbuilders-2012/) Over the last four years we've raised over 1.5 million dollars for Heifer International.

[Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&amp;A sessions I run on my blog.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/category/machine-gun-qa/)

1. You can ask any question.

2. Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer 80 questions instead of spending all my time writing up 3-4 long

3. One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way. It's going to be hard for me to write a carefully structured essay answering your five-part question.

4. I reserve the right to lie

  4b. If I ignore your question

5. I reserve the right to be honest

6. I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

**I will be back at 8PM Central to answer questions.**


**[Edit at 10:15 PM:] Merciful Buddha. I thought I was getting to the end of the list, I've used up all my words. I need to get a little nap in, then do some more writing tonight. Thanks for a great time everybody.**

*******************************


Hi, and one Spider-Man novel for Marvel.  I've done a bunch of jobs, some of which sucked, some of which were fairly awesome, from selling vacuum cleaners to graveyard-shift tech-support for an ISP.  The best part about my current job is that I can do it in my pajamas and I never, ever have to wear a freaking tie.

I like martial arts, and I probably play a bit more League of Legends than is good for me.  I read a lot.  Go figure.  I watch lots of nerd-compatible TV, and me and my writer-wife compete to see who can sum up the plot of any given show first and most accurately.  We usually get it done by about five minutes in.  I play a little guitar, a little keyboard, and I make noises which at times resemble singing.  I shoot a little, mostly with the finest weapon technology the 1860s had to offer, when I'm not using the finest weapon technology the 1860s BC had to offer.  I'm nearly adequate with either.

Excitement! The book charged up the charts, and reaching #18 in fiction as a whole.

I get 25% on ebook sales. But it's 25% of what the publisher get

I'd like to take a moment to pay tribute to this great man and giant of Fantasy literature. For various reasons, and no other books have played a bigger role in my imagination or my life as a reader.

James Rigney, many-volumed epic; the Wheel of Time had 5 books published before Terry Goodkind published *Wizard's First Rule*, 6 books published before George R.R. Martin published *A Game of Thrones*, and 8 books published before Steven Erikson published *Gardens of the Moon*. Rigney was breaking major tropes before it was cool; the idea that the Chosen One would be greeted not as a savior but feared as a destroyer was revolutionary.

Nearly everyone agrees that the first 5-7 books in the series are an absolute triumph of the fantasy genre. While no one argues that the series got bogged down in the last few books Rigney wrote

As he was dying, he left enough behind for Brandon Sanderson to carry the series over the finish line, with many fantastic scenes (according to Sanderson) being very close to Rigney's words verbatim.

So let's take a moment today and pay tribute to this great man,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,t3_100fh2

**Writing**

I have two series out: **The Riyria Revelations (Theft of Swords | Rise of Empire | Heir of Novron)** and **The Riyria Chronicles (The Crown Tower | The Rose and Thorn)** they are related (Chronicles is a prequel to Revelations) and they can be read in order of publication (my preference) or chronological (no spoilers if you choose this route). Today is release day for The Crown Tower (The Rose and Thorn will release on Sep 17 - my birthday). To celebrate, that makes them just $1.50 each.  If you want to try out my work for free, I have a short story (The Viscount and the Witch) and also an extended preview of The Crown Tower (first 5 chapters) that you can take a look at.

I have a science fiction novel: **Hollow World** that has been released only to those who pre-ordered through Kickstarter. This book will go on sale in April for the reading public at large. This project has an unusual publication history. It was turned down by my main publisher

I have short stories in a few anthologies: **The Jester** in Unfettered

Recommendation threads.

There are a LOT of these.  A LOT a lot.  The problem?  It seems like about 70 to 80 percent of people don't actually read what the OP is looking for in his/her personal thread

For example, and there are books that are close.  The Malazan  books fit the bill, Robin Hobb's books are close, etc.  But, inevitably, you've got the one guy that pipes up with Patrick Rothfuss, or Brent Weeks, or whoever else is popular.  This happens in every...single...recommendation thread.

It's not hard to mentally sieve through the stuff  you've read and actually answer the OP's question, and THOSE are the places to list the greats.  As much as I love the hell out of Abercrombie,  stop listing his stuff in a thread where the OP is requesting modern fantasy with a steampunk element.  I'm a super Malazan junkie, love the living fuck out of Erikson, and I don't pimp his stuff in every single recommendation thread.

To sum up:

It's not helpful.
It doesn't answer the OP's question.
It makes every rec thread around here look exactly the same

As I said before, awesome community would be even MORE helpful and awesome if we didn't use recommendation threads as opportunities to pimp our favorite authors, and instead just answered the damned OP's question. :)",,False,self,t5_2qknd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/16gho2/one_of_my_biggest_gripes_with_rfantasy_something/

Edit 1: Golly! 4 upvotes! The excitement. If we hit 7 I'll reveal a random fact about myself.

Random fact: I've done standup comedy in a boxing ring and onboard HMS Exeter just before it was decommissioned. Next random fact at 11.

Edit 2: Here's me speaking on Sky News about the [Icelandic economic crash in 2008](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQeSqRJZ28). To this day I have *no* idea why they called me rather than, ambassadors or politicians. Next random fact at 15.

Edit 3: I play for the Icelandic national Correspondence Chess team. Next random fact at 22. 

Edit 4: In my salad days I was in an 80's cover band with super-talented Icelandic singer-songwriter [Svavar Knutur](http://svavarknutur.com/fr_home.cfm) and assorted other genii. [This](http://www.myspace.com/mrknutur/photos/50384154) is a picture of us. Our name was 'Moonboots'

Edit 5: I have tap-danced in front of 250 drama students. That is on a very short list of things in my life that I am *never* doing again. Next random fact at 36.

Edit 6: I got to the 12-man finals of Britain's biggest new act comedy competition

Edit 7: I went to college with Gísli Örn Garðarsson

Edit 8: Eek! I no longer remember my face. Also

Edit 9: I am the court translator of epic Viking metal band [Skálmöld](http://www.skalmold.is/). Next random fact at 63. 

Edit 10: I spent 3 years as player/coach of arguably Iceland's worst ever men's amateur basketball team. We won one game in those three years - and it was the one where I didn't show. Next random fact at 72.

Edit 11: I lived in Norway for 7 years, provided my brain doesn't melt, at 80.

Edit 12: I am an award-winning translator. I translated all three High School Musical books from English into Icelandic. This is not a joke. Next random fact at 91.

Edit 13: I was an extra in a film called A Little Trip to Heaven

Edit 14: 100 upvotes. The obvious random fact should be that I am absolutely *pants* at estimating upvote worth on Reddit

- I have worked as, a longshoreman, a musician, a comedian, a caretaker for the mentally disabled, a journalist and a manual labourer in a cement-packing factory. I am currently employed as a teacher of Drama, English and Icelandic at a private school in London.

- I quit the acting profession after I heard of a casting for a man (tick) in his thirties (double-tick) with Icelandic/Norwegian accent (triple-and-quadruple-tick) to play a *Viking* (tick tick tick) whose **name** was Snorri - and I didn't even get an interview. (boom) After that I decided I could use my time for better things. I was correct.

- Last year I wrote a play in January based on the question of what would happen if Roger Federer and Andy Murray had to share a dressing room before the Wimbledon finals. It was performed at the International Youth Arts Festival in Kingston


01:28 GMT - Thank you tremendously

All the best

&gt;""First of all, adventure, mystery and philosophy. Most fantasy is one-dimensional. It's either about magic or a world-building. I don't do either."" - Terry Goodkind

It REALLY left a bad taste in my mouth.  I agree that good story telling (regardless of genre) have common aspects (romance, mystery and philosophy), but I feel he would have been much better off stopping there. Taking a cheap stab at what is clearly his ""genre"" seems like crapping where you sleep.  

Does anyone else feel this way?

-------------------------
EDIT: This is another quote that came up in the discussion section that I'm adding because it completely blew me away. Thaks to **p0x0rz** for digging it out. 

&gt;""What I have done with my work has irrevocably changed the face of fantasy. In so doing I've raised the standards.

I write industrial-era epic fantasy with flintlocks and magic. I was a student of Brandon Sanderson at BYU. In my spare time I bake, hang out with my rockin' wife, and keep a hive of honeybees.

I haven't won any awards... YET.

Unless there's an award for loving cake. Then I've won that one. A lot.

Hello


I’ve published [eleven novels in twenty-five or so languages, so I try not to mess up in that.


First fantasy trilogy was [*The Fionavar Tapestry*


Ask Me Anything has, so I ask people to try to avoid them in Q&amp;As about my work, or at least put up alerts for others. I find it painful to discuss how I came to be a fan of the Minnesota Vikings. Laugh, but be kind. I will be really, REALLY boring and bland if asked about the work of most colleagues.


Boxers, and “Deadwood”. It really is my middle name. The vessel with the pestle has the pellet with the poison and the flagon with the dragon has the brew that is true. “The Descendants” over “The Artist”. Currently, Springbank Claret Cask, but it changes often.


**I will be back at 8PM Eastern / 7PM Central to answer questions live.**


Let’s roll.

**Redditors, try to pick up on a few questions I missed and any follow-ups. You were - and I mean this - a terrific, interesting group, the questions were fun and a few were completely new. Thanks for inviting me, and thanks to elquesogrande for setting it up. Be good.**

Thursday morning tidying up. No broken glass, actually. So scroll and find the new answers. I'll check in at least once more to try to deal with follow-ups. Cheers.

I’m [Laurell K. Hamilton]( http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/) and in 1993 I published my second novel, as in zombies, and helped the police with preternatural cases as a consultant. She was also a legal vampire executioner in a world where vampires were legally alive and had rights, but they’d proved too dangerous to jail, so if they broke the law there was only one penalty – death. There was also this gorgeous master vampire named Jean-Claude, that I’d actually planned on killing before Anita would date him. 


Fast forward to 2013 and my newest book, and I didn’t kill off Jean-Claude like I planned, and you guessed it, they’re dating. Anita is also dating quite a few other people. It’s . . . complicated. * **faceplam** * *Affliction* is number 22 for Anita, and celebrates twenty years of her adventures, and me writing at least a book a year, sometimes two. It’s pretty cool to be able to write that. I’ve also written eight books in the Merry Gentry series, after a four year hiatus waiting for Merry and myself to work our issues. I’m a character oriented writer, and sometimes myself.
 

You can ask me anything, I really will answer almost any question so be sure you want the answer. I’ve surprised some fans at live Q &amp; A’s occasionally by my . . . candor.  * **evil grin** * 

One caveat, folks, there is no way to avoid all spoilers without limiting the questions to general writing questions. I’m happy to answer writing questions, but I’m just not sure how to avoid all spoiler questions for the entire series. * **puzzled** * So _NO_ _SPOILERS_ for *Affliction*, but for the rest, ask away.

FIRST, am a female.


And it's not that I dislike female characters, I know that at some point the exciting adventure is going to devolve (even if on the sidelines) into an eye-rolling romance of some sort. 


It seems a female can never be just another member of the ""fellowship"" (I use that term loosely, after all. If there is a female present, she *has* to be matched off with someone by the end. Yes, the fate of the world as she knows it may be on her shoulders, but god help us if she doesn't snag a boyfriend along the way.


It's all so predictable and it sometimes makes me feel like I'm watching the same two characters' relationships develop a hundred times through different movies or books.


I swear that I'm not a feminist or anything like that. I'm not a misogynist, just to see if it's as awesome as I found LotR and Hobbit to be. 


-BRIEF INTERLUDE: Yes I know that a story full of characters all of the same gender doesn't necessarily preclude romance. But a gay/lesbian romance would be INTERESTING and (despite the leaps forward the world is making) still takes some bravery


I know I've become kind of cynical about this, is only briefly touched-upon and not a distraction from the main story, but instead flavors it with its fleeting loveliness.


Finally, I acknowledge that there have been exceptions: a handful of authors or books who actually handled their characters *awesomely*.


Let me also say that I would LOVE to be proven wrong


Thanks for reading my semi-rant. No offense is meant at all, or for the same reasons.


No

EDIT: Now with 10% more snarky rant.

#EDIT #2: I should have thought more about saying ""I am not a feminist""

I’m a dual national US/UK citizen, London. I work as a research scientist and have done so in the UK and US. I now live in Bristol with my wife. We have four kids, some at university. The youngest, Celyn, is very disabled and when I’m not at work I’m her full time carer. Writing happens late at night when I should be sleeping.

 
I play video games (I’m a certified god at Modern Warfare II and Command &amp; Conquer III) though not so often of late. I read but rarely find the time. I misspent chunks of my youth playing D&amp;D and running fantasy play-by-mail.


I'm currently wrestling with my latest book
Despite appearances the only time I’ve ever read Joe Abercrombie is 5 minutes ago when directed to his Reddit intro as an example for writing my own. The ‘I’m currently wrestling ...’ line is cut&amp;pasted from his intro with ‘*Red Country*’ replaced by ‘*Gunlaw*’. I’m starting to hate him. He lives about 10 miles from me. 


*Gunlaw* is based on a series of short stories

 
Ask me anything.
 

**I will be responding to questions real time from 11pm-1am GMT (that’s 5-7 Central).**

I had a [twenty-year career with puppetry]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/puppetry/) doing work on stage and screen. I design, the balance has shifted so that most of my creative is as a writer. 


[I write fantasy and science fiction in both short form and novel length.]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/fiction-collectio/online-fiction/)  I write all over the map within the broad speculative fiction umbrella


I suppose this is where I should trot out the awards, and am currently a finalist for a Nebula award for my novel [*Glamour in Glass*]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/novel/glamour-in-glass/), and a Hugo finalist for Best Related work, for the [podcast Writing Excuses]( http://www.writingexcuses.com/) that I do with Brandon Sanderson, Dan Wells, and Howard Tayler.

I'm stealing Pat Rothfuss's guidelines for questions because

&gt;**Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&amp;A sessions I run on my blog.**


&gt;1.	You can ask any question.

&gt;2.	Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer 80 questions instead of spending all my time writing up 3-4 long

&gt;3.	One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way. It's going to be hard for me to write a carefully structured essay answering your five-part question.

&gt;4.	I reserve the right to lie

&gt;5. If I ignore your question

&gt;6.	I reserve the right to be honest

&gt;7.	I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

I'm [Elspeth Cooper]( http://www.elspethcooper.com/facts.html), Feb 2013 US), I'm finishing up Book 3 at the moment, with Book 4, *The Dragon House*, to come. I'm a sword owner, tea drinker, but hey

----

Hi, I'm an engineer at an aerospace company (and mom to an insanely active toddler).  When not writing, working, or chasing my son, I climb mountains, figure skate, squeeze through slot canyons, Colorado

----

[Brad Beaulieu]( http://quillings.com/about/) is the author of *The Lays of Anuskaya* trilogy, and (of course) vodka. He likes cooking (with as much spice as his wife can stand), sneaking out for movies (when his kids let him), and watching his kids grow (as long as it doesn't happen too quickly). And apparently he's developed a (sudden) fondness for parens...

----

Hello, and I write dark fantasy. I haven’t tried my hand at horror in many years, but I may take a turn at the genre before I’m done. I prefer dark fairy tales, and I love weaving magic and hauntings of all kinds into my stories.

I started writing when I was in my twenties and was represented by James Allen of the Virginia Kidd Literary Agency. I was really active on the local SFF scene in North Carolina
own good and never got published. I quit writing for several years to take care of my family and work full-time

I enjoy reading about religion and history, I will read almost anything (fiction and non-fiction) and love research most of all. Rock and roll works nicely for me. I live in North Carolina with my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, and I’m currently at my four cat limit.

I’m working on my second novel

----

I'm [Kameron Hurley]( http://www.kameronhurley.com/), and the forthcoming *Rapture* (Nov. 2012).  *God’s War* won the Kitschy Award for Best Debut Novel of 2011, and was nominated for both a Nebula Award and a Locus Award for Best First Novel. Right now I hack out a living in Ohio, a state where the extremely reasonable cost of living makes it an ideal place for low paid writers to establish apocalypse-ready compounds. My next novel, *Legion*, is a bloody space opera about two warring families battling for control of a fleet of cancerous world-ships sent out beyond the edge of known space. Perhaps they should have just stayed in Ohio…

----

[Anne Lyle]( http://www.annelyle.com/) was born in what is popularly known as “Robin Hood Country”, and swashbuckling heroes. Unfortunately there was little demand in 1970s Nottinghamshire for diminutive swordswomen, so she studied sensible subjects like science and languages instead.

It appears, you can’t take Sherwood Forest out of the girl. She now spends practically every spare hour writing – or at least planning – fantasy fiction about dashing swordsmen and scheming spies, set in imaginary pasts or parallel worlds.
Her first novel, *The Merchant of Dreams*, is due out December 2012, with a third volume scheduled for autumn 2013.

----

Hi, the first book in the *Tales of the Kin* series. My next book, *Sworn in Steel*, is due out in 2013 (no hard date yet, sorry). To date, I've been published in the U.S., U.K., France

When not writing, which qualified me for a veritable cornucopia of former occupations, including bartending, managing a bookstore, working in a brewery, writing freelance for the RPG industry, and now...Reddit! I've also been known to teach and fight renaissance rapier now and then
sane things.

Feel free to ask me anything. Heck

----

Hi, I grew up on the outside of things and part of me always remains there. *Knifesworn*, book two of the *Tower and Knife* trilogy, will be released late 2012.

----

[Mark Lawrence’s AMA from March is linked here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/rj5ir/hello_reddit_im_fantasy_author_mark_lawrence_ama/) and [his brief bio can be found on his blog here.]( http://mark---lawrence.blogspot.com/)  His debut novel, *King of Thorns*, will be released on August 7th.

[Stina Leicht]( http://www.csleicht.com/) is a 2012 Campbell Award nominee. Her debut novel *Of Blood and Honey*, *And Blue Skies from Pain* is in bookstores as of March 2012.

I have just finished reading A Memory of Light. I have been reading TWOT series for fifteen years now. I don't think I will ever read anything as profound as this series. For those who are unfamiliar with the series this may not mean much

But so much more. The nature of reality, wizards... etc"". I have never and probably never will read anything like it.

And most importantly for me, and it shows in the story. The series uses a lot of prophecies and omens throughout, and cryptic hints in book one are borne out all through the 14 books (14!).

It's not perfect. People have complained that the story stalls a lot, some say the women in wheel of time are all nags that hassle men, and men are all shy and clumsy and baffled by women. Others say the women are all departures from the classical damsel in distress or simpering maidens you see in fantasy, they take charge and aren't secondary to men at all.

David Eddings is the author of ""The Belgariad"" and numerous other book series. ""The Belgariad"" was the first fantasy series I ever read
Well I decided to look up Mr. Eddings on Wiki to find out why he hadn't written any new books lately. It turns out he passed away back in 2009. It also turns out that he used to live in my town. I don't know why I never found that out before, my favorite author of all time used to live.
So now I sit here, and for the opportunity, right at my door step, that I've lost forever.
Wherever you are Mr. Eddings, Polgara and Ce'Nedra, and all the other amazing characters you brought to life, I say, for what it's worth, thank you.",,self,,

I was born in Detroit and have recently returned to Michigan with my wife and twin toddlers after a decade in New York City. I spend my days writing my own books



[THRONE OF THE CRESCENT MOON]( http://www.amazon.com/Throne-Crescent-Moon-Kingdoms/dp/0756407117/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) is a sword-and-sorcery-meets-epic-fantasy novel. It's set in an invented world that draws on the 1001 Nights and medieval Arab history instead of European history and culture. THRONE is what might result if you were to throw the old AD&amp;D Dungeon Master's Guide, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon into a blender. 


As Scott Lynch put it *""Flashing swords, bloodthirsty monsters, and sumptuous cuisine... what more do you want me to do, draw you a map? Read this thing.""*

I guess what I’m saying here is that genre is hard.

My first book, and it won the Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel, the Sydney J Bounds Award for Best Newcomer, and was longlisted for a Stoker. 

My second book, and it won the Edgar Award for Best Paperback Original, as well as a nice runner-up thingy for the Philip K. Dick Award. 

[The Troupe](http://robertjacksonbennett.wordpress.com/the-troupe/) came out in 2012. It’s probably my most straight-fantasy book: it’s about vaudeville, and people seem to like it a whole bunch. It made or even topped a fair amount of “Best of 2012” lists.

[American Elsewhere](http://robertjacksonbennett.wordpress.com/american-elsewhere/) came out this last February. It is a Big McLargeHuge Giant book that has been used as a murder weapon to great success 9 times so far. (All in Florida.) So far people say it’s kind of like David Lynch meets HP Lovecraft

My erotic romantical novel of sensual sex and sexuality, and was briefly considered by the United Nations as a war crime, even with all the shit happening in Africa and stuff.

[Here is where I write.](http://www.orbitbooks.net/2010/10/04/the-writers-precious-workplace/)

[This is a place where I yell things.](https://twitter.com/robertjbennett)

Here is a list of things I like:

1. Bread
2. Keeping all or most fluids inside my body
3. Digging holes in the ground
4. Lotion
5. The one fireman who always comes to get me out when I get stuck in an empty oil drum
6. Walking in the woods
7. Looking at the sun through a Jolly Rancher (cherry is pretty good to look through
8. Petting an (alive) dog
9. When ducks fight over food at the park and really get into it
10. My wife and son (preferably alive

And here is a list of things I don’t like:

1. Other people having sex with my wife (please don’t do this)
2. Being repeatedly struck by a bus or maybe a really fast tractor
3. Chairs that wobble
4. When I take a bite out of a sandwich but instead of meat in there it’s just a rotten old sock (this hasn’t ever happened but it might and I think about it every time I pick up a sandwich)
5. When fluids leave my body
6. When I’m on my porch practicing opera, and then a wasp flies right in my mouth and just goes nuts in there (this has happened at least 4 times)
7. My dad’s friend Steve. Steve if you’re reading this you’re the worst and your Pontiac is dumb and you’re dumb
8. Fax machines (what ARE they??)
9. Ending lists on a 9
10. Lists in general

The best thing about it is that the more people who contribute to it the larger amount of feedback the works receive. So if you've any interest in fantasy but you're not planning on writing yourself you can still lend a hand with someone else's creation.

I was recently told by an editor that


My job, it doesn’t suck.  If you’re interested in our sailing adventures, drop by our [Sailing Blog](http://www.sailmrmac.blogspot.com/)


That hasn’t always been the case, I’m actually still paying my dues, though they are much less onerous than they once were.   I do, however, feel like I’ve really hit my stride.


I never thought to be a writer.  I wanted to be Jacque Cousteau.  No, I had a secret love: SF/Fantasy and RPG’s.  Finally, I got the idea to write up one of my RPG campaigns as a novel.  It’s been a rocky road, but I’ve had a surprisingly gratifying stint of self-publishing, a hit when I finally got the notion of putting my nautical experience into my stories (Duh!), several award winning novels, and finally a contract with Paizo for an RPG-related nautical fantasy


Now I’m a sailing writer, too.  So, go ahead and Ask Me Anything.  


I’ll be online for live Q&amp;A tonight from **7:00PM CST** until the rum is gone…

Recently I’ve signed two significant book deals. The first is with **Orbit**, uh, now). The second deal is a three book deal with the Amazon imprint **47North**, to publish my Breaking World books that I’ve co-authored with a dear friend and fellow indie author, [Robert Duperre]( http://robertduperre.com/).

I’m research scientist Mark Lawrence. I also write books. Unlike many authors it wasn’t ever my dream to be a professional writer. Even when I started writing books (in my mid 30s) I thought being published was so unlikely that I didn’t make it a goal.

So

The Broken Empire trilogy starts with [Prince of Thorns]( http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Thorns-Broken-Empire-Lawrence/dp/0441020321/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1290029691&amp;sr=8-1) 

I’ve linked the first 16 reviews to appear for [Emperor of Thorns](http://mark---lawrence.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/emperor-of-thorns-early-reviews.html)

*

My books are often described as unpredictable so it would be great if you could use spoilers like this [spoiler description](#s ""your spoiler text"") when appropriate and also indicate which book you’re spoiling as people might want to discuss King of Thorns spoilers but not Emperor of Thorns ones. (it tells you how to do it near the bottom right hand side of the /r/Fantasy page.

I have a fully accredited Geek Card, got a ZX Spectrum computer in 1982 and wrote bad games for it, and raised myself on fantasy books.

I decided that the latter crowd was probably right and that the negative reviewers missed some nuances. So I bought both books and started reading, or another character pointing out some inconsistency.. Otherwise, how would we actually know that he is an unreliable narrator?

I finished The Name of The Wind yesterday and I'm starting to agree with the Mary Sue crowd. There were only two incidents that I found that somewhat incriminated Kvothe as an unreliable narrator.

1. He admits to spreading false information about himself at the University
Rebuttal: everyone has told some lies to make themselves look better. The fact that Kvothe admits doing this doesn't make him any less reliable

2. When talking about the beauty of certain girl

In it, a small band of warriors and mystics raise their swords to save Europe from a bloodthirsty Mongol invasion. Inspired by their leader (an elder of an order of warrior monks), they embark on a perilous journey and uncover the history of hidden knowledge and conflict among powerful secret societies that had been shaping world events for millennia.

I was one of the main writers on the *Mongolian* storyline - dealing with Ogedei Khan, Chucai, and all those other guys. I've always been interested in the intermingling of cultures that results from imperialism, and the evolution of the Mongol empire in particular, so this was a somewhat perfect project for me. That sounds a bit pretentious for a martial arts epic I guess. I also like hitting things with swords.

In terms of my writing career to date I’ve published three novels, the third novel in THE WALL OF NIGHT series. I’ve also published a considerable amount of poetry internationally and some short fiction, although novels are my first prose love. 


The radio work involves interviewing poets and novelists for a local station and I also do interviews on my blog, on the first of every month on the [Supernatural Underground]( http://www.supernaturalunderground.blogspot.com/) and occasionally on [SF Signal]( http://www.sfsignal.com/). 


Other stuff I’m interested in outside of writing? I have a second dan black belt in the martial art aikido and represented my university in fencing. I am very interested in both history and astronomy, as well as both cooking food and consuming it—preferably in the company of friends.

So my Hyperion pitch. Hyperion is a Scifi novel that uses the Canterbury Tales style frame narrative of related short stories to present its plot. The short stories are tied to one another by the planet of Hyperion and a mysterious monster that lives there called the Shrike. The stories address a wide variety of high minded topics like the nature of life

The best part though, it quotes, references, or alludes to established work like The Canterbury Tales, the poetry of Keats, the poetry of Yeats, the famous heresies of the Catholic church

In the past five months, Patrick Rothfuss, Joe Abercrombie and many more.  Feedback from these authors has been very positive about the redditors at r/Fantasy:  ""I had a wonderful time, really worth it, great questions, I showed my publisher and she was floored, an exceptional time...I really hope that I didn't offend anyone.""  That type of response. Nicely done

Many of the older novels are superior to ones on this stringent modern list but not as well recognised and do not qualify.

**Preamble**

Seven months ago I compiled a [list of suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/okwoj/an_attempt_to_create_rfantasys_list_of_essential/) from the community as to what they regarded as the finest works of modern fantasy fiction. Now I've decided to create a condensed version of these results based on the process of elimination detailed below:

**Criteria**

In order to be part of this list, recognisably popular and relevant to the list at hand:

* No Young Adult fiction / Children's Literature / Paranormal
* Only one book per fantasy world (Discworld
* Only the first book of a series allowed
* No compilation books allowed (Rule excludes Theft of Swords by Michael J. Sullivan at author's request)
* Must be considered a work of fantasy foremost
* Must have at least 1
* Must have at least 3.80 overall rating on Goodreads
* Must be published after 1857
* Must be novel-length

With that in mind
 

**The List**

nitesmoke encouraged me to post here. Thank you for reading!

My daughter Sarah has been suffering from Crohn's Disease for ten years and it's not an overstatement, for 28 years now, and I've been through a lot, but nothing like her. Treatment after treatment fails for her after working only a short time, or worse, causes such a bad reaction that the medication itself actually has hospitalized her twice.

She has joint pain throughout her entire body after a bad reaction to Remicade a few years ago

Sarah's little sister, we thought she might be deaf. Now we're not sure what's wrong. She has a ""diagnosis"" of autism, but that was given to us by a speech pathologist who only saw her for 45 minutes. We think she might have suffered neurological damage from childhood jaundice but can't be sure. If there is damage, it's too ""mild"" to diagnose, so she gets ""autism"" instead. Izzy can barely speak and the words she does say are garbled and hard to understand. She has trouble with tasks like putting shoes on or taking them off, dressing, undressing, or at least attempt successfully around 50% of the time, affectionate, dance

I've posted on /r/assistance before, 25% of my take-home pay is going to Citibank so that we'll have a prayer of being debt free in around 4 years, providing there are no major problems between now and then. This is necessary because just the interest alone on this debt is leeching SO MUCH of our household income that it's literally destroying our family's well being. We can't take Sarah to clinical trials even if we got accepted to one because they're too far away and we can't afford plane tickets, hotels, or whatever, because of the $800-$1000 per month that I pay Citibank each month to keep ahead of the interest charges. Bankruptcy won't work for us. We'll be categorized Chapter 13 and then instead of our own aggressive repayment schedule, we'll have a court ordered

Like I said in the title, sick days, and snow days. When her joint pain became too severe for her to sit at her desk, she lay on the couch and wrote with pencil and paper.

Sarah wanted to sell her novel as an e-book to try to help our family out of this situation, wrote a foreword, and published the book to both Kindle and Nook.

You can read about the book here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/

You can read about Sarah's history

http://www.sarah-story.com

And the regularly updated blog is here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/news


Would any of you consider sharing the URL for the book (http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/) through social media, classmates, whatever you feel might be appropriate, if you're so inclined? There is a link on that page to download the book for free in EPUB format for the curious, and a donate link for ""tips"" if you like it, so it's not even necessary to buy the book if you want to read it, and you can pay what you want, the book is $2.99 (** UPDATE: non-US customers may have taxes or other fees added

I would dearly love any assistance anyone might give in spreading the word about this novel.

We're in Connecticut. I don't mean to be melodramatic, is going to come from. I'm already paying most of our bills two weeks late, and this week I had to take two days off unpaid to bring Izzy to a specialist consultation and a sedated outpatient diagnostic procedure. Things are getting bad. If we can generate interest in Sarah's book, it might bring some relief.

Thank you and kudos to you if you managed to read all of this. I'm not even sure where I'd begin on a TL;DR. Sorry if I've rambled.

** EDIT - Reddit, which will pay for 6-7 weeks worth of heating oil, which is good timing since it just started snowing outside last night. Thank you very, very much guys &amp; gals &amp; others. There are good people here. Sarah is extremely excited that people are reading her book. **

** EDIT 2 - We've lost our power, not a branch. We were able to use some of the donations to buy fuel for a generator we were loaned, but he generator blew when I hooked it up incorrectly due to bad advice. Still, redditors, without your donations we wouldn't have been able to go buy $100 worth of non-perishable food items at Walmart when we lost everything in our refrigerator. Thank you again. Our power (and water because we have a well) is expected to be out a week or more. **

I started them when I was ten.  I'm 29 now.  I've read a lot of books in the interim.  I've learned a bit about the world, and I hope to keep doing it for a goodly while.

Le Guin's work is often about stories and the roles they play.  It's not a coincidence that my first instinct after closing the cover (or hitting *Back*--some rituals just don't translate gracefully to the digital age) was to come talk to you folks.  

/r/Fantasy is a special place.  We're professionals, authors, artists, and publishers, people looking for our first recommendations, and seasoned genre veterans.  We bicker and heckle and make lists and categorize because that's what people do when they love.  We love.

We love what fantasy means and what it does.  Fantasy shows us who we are, for our inner worlds to be shared and colonized.  Fantasy shows us that we're not so alone.  

The act of creation is magic, that no one responds to art without confronting something of themselves. 

Fantasy defies neat limits and rules.  Some people want a knight who'll save the day.  Some want an allegorical exploration of economic exploitation told through anthropomorphic squirrels. And some people just want to read about some cool shit.  There's a place in fantasy

Before this gets more self-indulgent and maudlin, and availability of great speculative work is unparalleled.  The ability to come together with creators and fans all over the world to share our passion for all things fantasy is incredible.

I have written and published six books spread across three series this year. You can find most of them free on Amazon from tomorrow [here](http://www.amazon.com/J.-R.-Karlsson/e/B007AQQGFK). Alternatively

A compendium of my entire work can be found in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11qvno/since_were_discussing_selfpublished_authors_heres/) thread for free if you're not a fan of Amazon.

My official website (still a work in progress) can be found [here](http://www.jrkarlsson.com).

Additional biographical info: I was born in a small town called Ballymoney in Northern Ireland in 1985

I've been an active redditor and member of this community under this username for over two years now

Outside of writing I like PC gaming, wrestling and popular TV shows about meth labs and serial killers.

I write full-time as of this year

In 1993 I left a job teaching English at James Madison University to join TSR as Associate Editor of *Polyhedron Newszine*
 
 
Through guile and patience (mostly patience) I moved through the ranks of various magazines at TSR, Dragon, Star Wars Insider &amp;Gamer*, and at last *Amazing Stories*. One the side, I continued to write stories and novels whenever the opportunity arose, most prominently in the Sembia series.
 
 
In 2004 I left Paizo and the U.S. for a brief stint designing video games. At the 2008 World Fantasy Convention in Calgary
 
 
Since then most of my fiction has been for Paizo, and the novels *Prince of Wolves, Master of Devils*, and the recent *Queen of Thorns*. All of those feature the investigator-adventurers Count Varian Jeggare and his bodyguard Radovan Virholt. I also had the great privilege and pleasure of co-writing *Winter Witch* with Elaine Cunningham, and I’ve written stories for *Tales of the Far West, Shotguns v. Cthulhu*, and *The Lion and the Aardvark*.
 
 
Earlier this year devilishly persuasive Trent Oster lured me back into the world of video game writing, iPad, and other platforms.

Hobbies…I like to LARP (live action role play), Roll Through the Ages, and Merchants &amp; Marauders are my current favourites). Munchkin has been banned from my house; we aren’t mature enough to handle it! I liked comic books as a kid, but fell out of the habit as an adult. I’m slowly getting back into DC’s New 52. Batman and Catwoman are my favourite, but I do have a weak spot for the Justice League, too.

I love replicating old recipes and lost skills and *[What Kings Ate](http://kristadball.com/2012/11/what-kings-ate-and-wizards-drank-is-out-today/)* (WKA) gave me the opportunity to really unleash my passions: history, grinding my own flour, and talking about how to properly eat rabbit bone marrow (mmmm one of my favourite childhood foods).

*“The books are good, I experienced a fit of rage, then a fit of depression, then I ate some lunch and had a bit of a lay down.”*

    —Patrick Rothfuss

*“Joe Abercrombie’s BEST SERVED COLD is a bloody and relentless epic of vengeance and obsession in the grand tradition, a pair of poisoners, a serial killer, a treacherous drunk, a red-handed warrior and a blood-soaked mercenary captain. And those are the good guys … The battles are vivid and visceral, the action brutal, the pace headlong, reversals

I’ve loved reading fantasy and science fiction ever since I can remember, backpacker, canyoneer, skier…heck, anything that involves adrenaline and wilderness, I adore.  I also figure skate, and have competed several times at the Gold level at USFSA’s Adult Nationals.  Oh yeah, everything from gothic/industrial/electronica to choral classical – we sing regularly with the Colorado Music Festival chorus for performances of masterworks like Mozart’s Requiem

I was born in Georgia, where I first put on a harness and climbing shoes.  Now I live in the climber’s paradise of Boulder, Colorado with my husband and son, where we take full advantage of all the mountains have to offer.  To pay for my writing habit and all my adrenaline sports, I work as an electrical engineer in the space industry – a job in which I get to do science fictional things every day (part of why I choose to write fantasy in my free time!).

I'm [Kat Zhang](http://katacomb.blogspot.com), film geek, caffeine fiend, and author of the young adult novel [WHAT'S LEFT OF ME](http://hybridchronicles.katzhangwriter.com/About.html). The book is what I like to call ""speculative fiction,"" or maybe ""light-sci-fi"" or ""science-fantasy""...or maybe just ""alternate universe."" It's also been referred to as ""that character-driven sci-fi-ish book with the dystopian feel and touches of horror,"" so yeah. What I can say for sure is that it's about a 15-year-old girl struggling to reclaim control of her body in a world where two souls are born into each child and one is doomed to disappear.

http://mark---lawrence.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/what-is-grimdark.html

It's a phrase that gets thrown around a lot - often as an accusation.

Variously it seems to mean:

- this thing I don't approve of
- how close you live to Joe Abercrombie
- how similar a book's atmosphere is to that of Game of Thrones

I've seen lots of articles describe the terrible properties of grimdark and then fail to name any book that has those properties.

So what would be really useful is

b) some actual books that are that thing.",self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1emuvt/what_is_grimdark/

Hello


My passion is combining great art with great writing,* and also adult Swords &amp; Sorcery with *The Burning City.* In creating these titles I’ve had the honor of working with fantasy art legends like Todd Lockwood, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson, Tim Truman, Janet Aulisio, Brom
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Howard Tayler**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Tayler) is best known as the creator, but he is also a contributor to *X-treme Dungeon Mastery* and Skull Island eXpeditions, and podcasts weekly with Brandon Sanderson, Mary Kowal, and Dan Wells on [Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/). He and his family live in Orem, Utah.
 

Born in Florida in the late '60s, focused practice, and will occasionally scold people for saying ""I wish I could do that"" when what they mean is ""I want to learn to do that.""
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
[**Alyssa Faden**](https://www.facebook.com/AlyssaFadenCartography) had the good fortune to be born in England and therefore did all of the usual geeky things - live roleplay, with intact Roman walls and a Coliseum, but Alyssa was and she fully embraced it in every respect. Is it any wonder that she was the first to be playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in her school? With a lust for the unknown and the magical country of ""America,"" she emigrated in 1998 and has been spreading 'home country historical goodness' via the medium of 'cartography' ever-since. She considers every mapping commission to be a privileged step into the mind of another person; seeing the mystical and fantasy worlds that they have created. The result is more than a map ... it is a living representation of years of imagination, a place where people and creatures roam, ships sail, and armies march. And who can't get excited by something like that? 

Alyssa's recent mapping endeavors have been for Kobold Quarterly, Jon Brazer Enterprises, and Jim Pinto's ""King for a Day.""

Hello! [I'm **Todd Lockwood**.](http://www.toddlockwood.com/) I've been illustrating professionally for thirty+ years, and the Drizzt do' Urden tales of RA Salvatore. I'm also a published author, with stories in the [*Tales of the Emerald Serpent*](http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Emerald-Serpent-Ghosts-ebook/dp/B008C6JE2Y) anthology, the [*Unfettered* anthology](http://grimoakpress.com/unfettered/), and am working on a novel for DAW Books, release date to be determined.
 
In my copious spare time I sell prints, garden, play with/yell at my cat, and shout into the void.

Hi, Master of Devils, Queen of Thorns,* and the upcoming *King of Chaos*. Other recent publications include “The Devil’s Pay” and *Dark Convergence* for Skull Island eXpeditions, as well as stories in in *Tales of the Far West, The Lion &amp; the Aardvark,* and *Shotguns v. Cthulhu.*
 

Years ago I edited magazines from *Dragon* to *Star Wars Insider* to *Amazing Stories.* I've occasionally taught English and written for computer games

I had thought this the best part; I enjoyed the idea of giving and receiving a book was almost incidental to the whole process for me.

My match, I'd not have touched them under my own steam.  I had so little idea of what I was missing. 

I have never read books with such beautiful and emotive prose! I felt immersed in these stories in a way that I have not enjoyed with others. This wasn't a deeper immersion, stories and vision. To me, it felt like a symphony. I finished Tigana about 30 minutes ago, whilst listening to [this](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DM3hFN8UrBPw&amp;h=hAQEg-_qM) and in the midst of a very stressful time, it was something I very much needed.  

I am writing this for a number of reasons. One, and I want the same for you. 

Two, you have my utmost gratitude! Thank you, for sharing with me something you enjoyed so much and that I can now share with others! 

And finally three, to avoid international shipping costs (I decided to go global; shipping my book to Texas and having mine sent to me from Belgium, I think). Reading someones profile and trying to find something you think they will enjoy was a surprisingly fun process, and something that really made me think and look at lots of books I otherwise wouldn't. It can also lead to a very enjoyable time perusing your local bookstore! And in return, you will hopefully receive something that another person has loved and shared, that you will grow to love as well, looking forward to sharing it yourself.

This book is like Pan's Labyrinth crossed with Game of Thrones. I would call it a fairy tale for adults. It is dark, but it completely works, thanks to the crisp prose that Jack Vance is a master of.

My problem is, become edited and hammered into a finished product on the forge of the post writing process. 

I'm not going to name names, posted it here, thanked people for downloading it, and even posted a book trailer.  In many ways, they treated this book as a finished product that was ready to go to market.  The book itself, however, was riddled with dialogue that needed to be completely redone, etc.  The thing that irritates me about this is that the book was based on some great ideas and shows REAL PROMISE.  I could see this being a book I was willing to buy.  But it's sorely in need of beta reading, the author finished the novel, and released it as ""done.""

When I'm not writing stories, I am generally either playing games (sometimes also with my family) or writing about them (either on my own website or something else's). I play a lot of computer games and MMOs, as well as pen and paper RPGs and boardgames -- a hobby that goes back (for me) to the very early eighties. I watch a few TV shows (Game of Thrones, Community, Doctor Who), and mourn many more (Firefly, Wonderfalls, with breaks in between in which I interact with other humans and remember to eat and take my kids to school. Some of my favorite authors are Terry Pratchett, and Tolkien. Naomi Novik has recently shouldered her way in there as well.

I've been an active participant and supporter of National Novel Writing Month for over ten years, a 'NaNoWriMo Novel', albeit one that saw extensive expansion during the revisions that followed that somewhat spare first draft.

I am currently working on a novel called *Adrift*, which gives my agent a bit of a headache but makes me smile. Once that's wrapped up, I'm heading back to the setting of Hidden Things for awhile.

**QUICK REVIEW**

Back in September

/r/Fantasy has doubled in size during that time and continues to grow at a phenomenal rate.  Even better


Quite a few of the new /r/Fantasy members and participants are authors and professionals from around the industry.  It's a blast to watch questions and jabs in each new AMA posted by Brandon Sanderson, Howard Andrew Jones, Brent Weeks, Peter V Brett, James L. Sutter, Jim C Hines, Michael Sullivan and authors who we will schedule for future AMA's as well.

Thanks


**WELCOME FANTASY BLOGGERS &amp; REVIEWERS**

One ongoing issue in /r/Fantasy is the lack of daily posts - especially higher quality posts.  We have several members of the Fantasy blogging / reviewing community who joined us recently and they are doing their best to add value while **not** posting direct blogspam.  

It's an odd dynamic and one that we will continue to work through.  I personally like to see the original content and FYI's from people who keep a finger on the pulse of the Fantasy world.  Yes

Please keep this perspective in mind when voting on blogger and reviewer-related posts.  Don't automatically downvote - please judge these posts by the content provided.  Let the mods know if the posts start to cross over into blogspam territory and we'll work to back off the volume.



**UPCOMING AMA's**


We have several AMA's coming up later this year ranging from big names in the industry to some new authors as well.  The mods will not post names or dates until they are confirmed.  More to come when when learn more.

To date


**ACTION:  AMA REQUESTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Please post below some names that you would love to see come in for an /r/Fantasy AMA.**  

This could include anyone involved in the Fantasy genre - authors, TV, music, business-related and more.  Get creative!  Just let us know and we'll do our best to make it happen.

Even better - do you know anyone personally who might want to do this?  If so

I have a blog over at [tristan.rambles.blogspot.com](http://tristanrambles.blogspot.com/)


Writing-wise, you just might enjoy this one. 


Furthermore I have a pretty well-regarded series of fantasy novellas called The Wandering Tale, fighting, and magic.


Finally, all of my work is available on both Amazon and Smashwords (and the various Smashwords channels such as Barnes &amp; Noble) with the exception of Twixt Heaven and Hell, which is currently only available on Amazon. 


All those titles up there are links and you can pretty reliably find all my stuff by searching for ""Tristan Gregory"" in any eBook store.


I like writing things with different feels, I decided to go out on a limb today and post a piece I'll be including in an upcoming collection of my science fiction. It is very short and – for me – rather experimental. 

**I hope you enjoy it, or whatever the heck else you'd like in the comments below.**


Thanks for your time!

*The Last Gasp of the Dragon*


The dragon slumbered upon its mound of stone and stolen riches. It's lair was no dank cave – this serpent loved the sun

The creatures of the land were wary of the dragon. Its children scurried about below its massive bulk, and occasionally disappeared inside it. Sometimes they came away from the bed of stone to kill, carrying back their carrion to serve the dragon's hunger – terrible even in indolence.

That hunger was the beast's undoing. Like all dragons, bloated metal things. Their children, starving and sick, picked through the bones; soon to die as well.

It was waking. Birds took flight and fled at the first hiss

There were no children scurrying about the dragon now. They had given themselves to it one by one

It had no children left. Nothing to feed it. Nothing to keep it. The roar reverberated suddenly through the jungle, and eventually even this place would grow dark and cold.

This one had escaped

Did its wings have the strength to carry it to lands beneath some distant sky? Or would it finally starve

A couple of friends and I flew over to London from Ireland for his book signing in Forbidden Planet yesterday
 
My friends Dylan and Mairead were ahead in queue, he allowed us a little extra time to ask him questions because we’d made the trip over and we got a picture with him. He also mentioned that, if he had time, he’d stay behind and answer some more questions after the signing.

His signing didn’t end until about 4:20 p.m., and since it was just Joe and I left, we had a one (technically two) on one Q &amp; A with Brandon Sanderson. It was awesome. He talked to us for about 15 / 20 minutes. We were running out of questions as we didn’t expect to have such an extensive time to speak to him, especially by ourselves, so we hadn’t prepared all that many. Our friends Dylan and Mairead had gone to check into their hotel but were on the way back and Brandon offered to wait with us for another few minutes to speak with them (this was all after nearly 4 hours of booking signing and question answering already!).

We waited for them outside Forbidden Planet and when they arrived, WoK and anything else we could think of. Before he left, he had one more gift for us. He gave me one for the codes for the Great Hunt (which I will use later, and probably post to Theoryland for those who are interested)! After he’d left, Joe and I went back into Forbidden Planet, chancing our arm in the hopes of getting a free t-shirt. They had none spare but two employees gave us their t-shirts as they weren’t going to keep them. To those two guys I would like to say thank you so much, you are awesome.

We got some interesting reactions and answers from the questions we asked. If anyone is interested in them, some of which contain spoilers for Alloy of Law, WoK etc. so if anyone is interested, let me know. I’d post them now but I feel I’ve typed too much already, and if you’re still reading, thanks!

To summaries

Brandon Sanderson, Dylan and Mairead.

A r/Fantasy member also flagged this post for removal.  My guess is that the reaction was based on keeping r/Fantasy meme and FUUUUUUU free.


I am leaning strongly towards banning FUUUUUU and meme submissions outright - no matter how relevant they might be to the Fantasy genre.     Some of the more popular subreddits have spiraled into ADD-fueled meme and FUUUUU submissions with little discourse or content remaining.  Meme and FUUUUU submissions can be fun to read...maybe r/Fantasy isn't the right place for them.

He was the first author to introduce me at a young age to a fantasy world that really showed people for what they were. 

He took real-world history and created his own worlds from it. 

He loves to make huge time lapses in his series to turn that world upside down with new technology and it's own past. His characterizations were detailed - the Moidart from the Rigante series was a complex

The sipstrassi tales- with a time gap from Arthurian fantasy to post-apocalyptic hell 
Drenai saga - great stuff.
Rigante - my favorite. With a time gap from old Druidic - to a Britain-like occupied Scotlandish country with guns and sword duels. 

I know I'm not writing this well but it's just something that's been on my mind. Maybe my nostalgia has made the books greater than they are. I know most of you know of waylander. But he doesn't hold a candle to Jon Shannow
