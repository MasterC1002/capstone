###Download thread with links to the episode (Added just now)

http://www.reddit.com/r/TopGear/comments/17dyrc/top_gear_season_19_episode_1_download_video_links/
_______
###Live Stream Top Gear 


Links :

1) http://www.filmon.com/#BBC-Two

2) http://www.stream2watch.me/live-tv/bbc-2-live-stream

3) http://nowwatchtvlive.com/2012/04/bbc-2-hd-live-stream-uk/

4) http://www.vipboxsports.me/uk-tv/65473/1/uk-tv---bbc-2-london-live-stream-online.html

You can use any flash supporting internet browser to watch this Live. These streams are aired 24/7 and I've provided 4 so in the case on of them goes down you will still have alternatives.  Runs on cellphones with flash support such as Androids.

**Advantage** : Watch the show live

**Disadvantage** : Streams can be unreliable and are of low quality. Streams can lag too so test them before the show.

_______

###Torrents

The Torrents of the show are posted 1 hour in SD after the show airs and 2-3 hours in 720p HD after the show airs with 1080i taking 3+ hours. Here is where you can find them :

1) http://www.finalgear.com/shows/topgear/

This links will post the show before anyone else apart from www.Thebox.bz which is a private tracker for which you can apply for an account and see if you get in if you are willing to go through the trouble.

2) http://thepiratebay.se/search/top%20gear/0/3/0

Start refreshing this link after the show airs. TPB lists torrents late on search but they are uploaded just as fast as final gear (just 5 or 10 mintues after it). Speed for TPB is not as fast as final gear as the number of downloaders is too high and the seeders are less likely to stay.


**Advantages** : Unmatched quality

**Disadvantage** : Takes 1 hour+ to get the show as the recorder needs to index and convert it.
________

###Online Websites that show the show as a video

1) streetfire.net

This website also uploads the show as a video.


2) http://www.1channel.ch/watch-5231-Top-Gear

You can check this site for all episodes of Top Gear and they are uplodaded to watch online for free.

**Advantages**: Easy viewing anytime without downloading or waiting.

**Disadvantages** : 3rd fastest alternative

_________

###iPlayer

Watch it on the iPlayer if you are in the UK

Here is an iPlayer proxy application

We have used this at /r/Formula1 before and this shows up as a virus on some anti-viruses but it does work. I don't use it myself so its up to you.
