I already enlisted [/r/England](http://www.reddit.com/r/england/comments/1i2wph/hi_rengland_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with_a/), [/r/Italy](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/1i5djq/hi_ritaly_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help_with/) and [/r/France](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1it0qh/hi_rfrance_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help_with/). Going through the different regions where I need postcards from. 

While I would like to repay for the postcard and the stamp

We've traveled quite a bit over the years

I'm a nineteen year old student currently studying in Brussels. I study at an English speaking university for Erasmus students and other foreigners who wish to study in English. I am very very interested in trying to stay here and integrate myself into Belgium and its culture. I know a very limited amount of French, and I've heard that people come out fluent or near fluent by the end. HOWEVER, I'm scheduled to leave at the end of May.

I have many personal reasons for wanting to live in Belgium. For one, but I seriously have never found myself so happy in my entire life. I want to make something work here. If I could find work, an extension on my visa, and a university (I may just stay at the one I'm at now, but I would prefer to live in Flanders), I really think I could really start trying to come Belgian permanently. 

I came here to see what r/belgium had to say and what kind of advice you guys maybe had to offer. I'm very open to any kind of ideas that come to mind; this is a very serious desire I have to become Belgian.

TLDR: American girl wants to permanently move to Belgium. Want ideas on how to start or where to go.

I rode a bus for the first time in my life and it was fantastic! I worked as a tour guide in Bruges for a few weeks with a few girlfriends. Their husbands work with my SO so they needed something to occupy their time and taught me how to do it too.
I didn't finish much art at all
I didn't have much trouble at all getting around, enough to read menus when we went out and be polite, my SO really appreciated the menu part.
I had to purchase a phone in Belgium because my phone is too old to work in Europe
I was prepared for the expense
Thank you all so very much! You made me less nervous and gave me a lot of great information. I'm sorry that I bugged you all with a question like this one

**TL;DR: You guys are awesome, and I'm in love with Belgium.**





Hello! I was just hoping for a little advice/information from you regarding Belgium. My SO is flying from Nevada to Brussels for the month of February for work and has asked me to join him. It's a very last minute trip and I am not at all prepared
    I am from Texas and really only speak English and a little Spanish. I don't want to commit any social crimes during my visit so if there are any customs or manners of dress that I need to observe please let me know. 
    I will have oodles of free time while my SO is working

Thank you for reading and for all of your help!

**TL;DR: My SO called today and said ""Surprise! You're going to Belgium!"" and now I'm worried about everything.**

Edit: Thank you to everyone that is responding. I'm already breathing easier. 

To add some details I left out:

* I have never been out of the United States before and I have only traveled to Arkansas, Utah, and Nevada. (Not counting trips I took as a child that I barely remember.)

* I'm very interested in nature and art. I am an artist and I am studying to become an art teacher. It is a goal of mine

* I'm in Las Vegas Nevada currently

* He will be working very close to **Oostkamp** so we will be staying in that area

* I'm really excited to use public transportation because I have never really had the opportunity to do so before. I will admit that it is intimidating to think about though

A solution that sometimes comes up is to make English an official language. When I meet French-speaking Belgians abroad, should do everything in our power to prevent that our peoples simply can't communicate with each other. I simply do not trust the media or the politicians to communicate for us.

This idea might be very ""Flemishcentric"". I know Flemings, for one, wouldn't mind one bit if Wallonian schools spend more time teaching English and stop teaching Dutch altogether. Who could blame the Wallonian youth for choosing English over Dutch? The older generation might also have problems with English but this proposition deals more with the future of Belgium rather than its current form. Maybe we could start preparing now to make English an official language in -let's say- twenty years. 

Furthermore

As you may have already noticed: I am in no way an expert in these matters. I was just wondering what r/belgium has to say about this. Is this scenario even slightly realistic? Is it even a solution to anything? and if not: what other options are there?

1334597599.0,scny1,should I continue my android app?(de lijn),_mars_,23,0,11,"so a year ago I released my first android app
It's a pretty simple app that displays the timetables of the busstops for De Lijn.


I've been struggling with de lijn every month because they never sent me the datasets on time, stuff like that)...


this resulted in a lot of unhappy users.

while all this time they promised me to give me access to webservices that would fill in the gaps and allow me to code a route planner (from A to B) and kept postponing it like they did with the datasets


so a month ago they really exagerated and gave me the datasets 3 weeks too late

then they release their own app that's connected to their webservice and has all the functions their site has while my app was down.

Now my app dropped from 7000 users to 6500(in the first week) and is dropping every day even though the datasets are updated now and they gave me access to the webservices.

also their app doesn't show the timetables( like you would see in the busstops )

I made this app because there was no way to access the data on a mobile phone and just wanted to help out people like me(students)

now my dilemma is...

should I put more time in my application to implement new functions? or just delete it from the market

Recently Di Rupo proposed to raise the taxes on company cars to generate an extra 200 million euro for the Belgium government. Judging by the calculations I've made using the published formula (car price incl. VAT and excl. promotions * CO² * 6/7)

This isn't something to be taken lightly as this will impact people's budget

To me personally

I understand that everyone needs to chip in during the fight to keep our country financially healthy during the crisis. I also understand that having a company car was an extremely nice bonus on top of a salary and that this seemed unfair to others without company cars. Therefore I'm more than willing to pay an increased tax for the privilege of having a company car. If only they'd give me an indication that they'd actually thought about it instead of just inventing some formula that looks like it was conceived in some federal private ""fat-cat"" meeting during a round of ""Why we love to dump on the middle and lower class"" stand-up comedy.

Judging from what I read in the newspapers

Or is it?

I think that they're going to get used to getting this extra money from company cars and that this tax is here to stay. This isn't some measure in time of need

I follow the news on the [California Proposition 19](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_19_(2010)) and was wondering what the current parties in Belgium thought about legalisation of cannabis. I send them all an e-mail why this would help our economy and current drug-problem (regularization, better controlling of addicts and quality of the drug, killing down the illegal market, cannabis isn't a gateway drug, less addictive then coffee, alcohol,...). And this is a short tl;dr

* Groen!
&gt; They agree with almost everything I told them and said they want to make cannabis legal.
* Vlaams Belang
&gt; Ignored a couple of studies I send them and responded with older studies (from 1997 etc) and wanted to make the small doses again illegal and want to put more resources into drug-prevention.
* N-VA
&gt; Want to make it illegal again and more resources into drug-prevention. Ignored almost everything I said in my huge e-mail and I received an e-mail that seemed to be pre-made.
* CD&amp;V
&gt; Responded back with a huge e-mail
* SP-A
&gt; Same as N-VA

So

For the respond time

I have send a new e-mail to all parties with my respond to their e-mail (or their not-respond) and I will keep you guys up-to-date.

You can always send an e-mail yourself if you have any questions about any party their view on anything. I see too many people these days complaining about everything and how the politics are doing everything wrong but they do not want to spend 5 minutes with just sending an e-mail to that party with their complain? 

**Edit #1**
I have send an e-mail to every French party in the current [senate](http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&amp;MENUID=11500&amp;LANG=nl). I have also noticed that Open-VLD has not responded to my mail yet (On 10/09/2010 I have send all Flemish parties my e-mail). I have also noticed a couple of spelling errors and now I feel ashamed :-( I should proof-read my e-mails!

I think bilingual (or even multi-lingual) tv channels would definitely help our children being more open on other languages in their early years...

1. The slices are way too thin to make a descent sandwich, like for instance cheese+mayo+cucumber, it will be soggy and/or collapse. Forget about something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/H6hMM.jpg)

2. The bread gets stale really quick. Like within a day. This is I think one of the reasons you will find bread vending machines all over Belgium (and not in many other countries
   
   - They don't let the dough rise long enough (this also as an effect on the taste
   - The bread has a very soft crust
   - Bread is sliced to thin
   - They use paper-bags for packaging which are not air-tight

My girlfriend and I have been steadily working on our Dutch using Rosetta Stone

We promised friends back home that we would bring them back chocolates. What is a decent store to go to where we won't spent a ton of cash? Yesterday we went to the Carrefour market down the block from us and picked up a box of GuyLian shells for 5

For anyone who wanted to hang out before then, and nothing is going to keep me out of your country now! I'll try to sort through the mess of comments in the last thread and get in touch with everyone who volunteered to hang out.

I posted this to /r/Brussels with no luck

I sincerely apologize if this has been posted before. My boyfriend (u/dsgn09 in case he posts here) and I may be moving to Brussels in the fall! We are from the United States, and both pursuing a Masters degree at an English speaking University (I in International Relations, he in Public Policy). 

Of course my parents would like for me to get over there before accepting my admission and we are hoping to make it to Belgium for our Spring Break, I can only use the Internet to get a feel as to whether or not Brussels will be a good fit, which I'm sure it will be. However, planning an international move without even knowing the place is a little scary. This is where you lovely redditors can come in. :)


My questions: 

* 1) Where's the best place to look for a place to rent online? Craigslist prices seem too good to be true. Are prices per week or month if it's not specified--I've seen it both ways. Also
 
* 2) How expensive is living in the city--food
 
* 3) Is Brussels a good place to live? If we can't make it before moving, is the public transportation reliable/decent because we will not be bringing our cars over with us. 
 
* 4) I know zero Dutch, and I truly pity anybody who has to hear me speak it. Everywhere says I can get away with mostly English, at least in Brussels, but culturally speaking, am I going to be screwed? 
 
If you can think of any more information that would be helpful for us, because I'll be honest, I'm scared to death, but I'm also really excited. Once again, sorry if this is posted all the time.

I don't understand what the point is of blowing up bridges with other countries that indeed have things in commen and affirm their diplomatic relations. 

As a flemish Belgian I am ashamed that the biggest flemish party wants to blow up bridges with other cultures. Other countries who are a member of la francophonie include countries like Switzerland. Even an independent Flanders I think would benefit from being a member of La Francophonie.

I am coming as an exchange student to Leuven in mid-September to study for a year at KUL. I am super excited and can't wait to finally get there. Now

1) Is Belgium really as awesome and fascinating as I expect it to be?

2) I will be flighting in to Brussels around 9am on a weekday and plan to take a train to Leuven right from the airport. Is this the easiest way to get to Leuven from Brussels?

3) I believe I will have some temporary accommodation at KUL for a week or so.  How long (on average) does it take to find an apartment? Do you call it ""an apartment"" or ""a flat""? Do you recommend having flat mates or get a studio for my self? What are rent prices on average for each? Are utilities usually included

4) What are some good areas of Leuven to look for a place to live in? Some description would help: nice, far from everything or party central. What are some of the areas I should stay away from? 

5) Does your wall plug have two circular wholes? 220V?

6) Are the university (workout) gyms any good? Is there a swimming pool? What about jogging trails? Do people do morning jogs or am I going to be ""that-Canadian-guy-who-runs-around-the-streets""?

7) Is a bike useful

8) What do male students wear to class? bar? clubs? Dress pants or jeans? Dress shoes or runners?

9) What is the general attitude toward international students? Please be honest here :D What about Canadians?

10) I've heard of download limits in Leuven. Are they everywhere or could it be possible to have a no limit internet at my apartment? What are the rules for downloading copyright movies and music like in Belgium?

11) What about cell phones? who are the cheapest/best guys? Should i get a plan or pay for minutes? How much does this cost?

12) Now, pay for rent? Is this more than enough? Or will I have to live and eat at min? What amount  should I budget for? Keep in mind that I'm really down to earth.

13) Does anyone want for me to bring anything from Canada?

14) Is school really hard and has heavy study loads? Is there anything you think I should know?......

Apparently next year on/around Remembrance Day there is a walk of remembrance in the Knokkee area.

I love to be able to surprise her with this trip (she thinks it would be nice but doesn't expect us to go since it would be so expensive).

We would probably go for a week and want to tour the areas around Knokkee. I will obviously try to get more information about specific areas. 

I guess I'm looking for things like:

Does Belgium have all inclusive resorts? Or is that just a Caribbean thing. IF they do not have all inclusive(s) what can one expect to spend on food for a week? How expensive is it to visit Belgium?

1342845477.0,wwtci,What is your opinion about Leuven?,-Tyrion-Lannister-,14,0,30,"I'm debating starting a job in Leuven

**Some specific questions:**  

1. Oude Markt looks pretty intense! Is the social atmosphere of Leuven generally dominated by 16-22 year olds clubbing and drinking hard, and enjoy some culture? (I love to party, but sometimes I also like to be sober enough to carry on a conversation once in a while...)
2. How's the Belgian live music scene? Local art scene? Local intellectual scene? Are student special-interest clubs open to non-students in the community?
3. I don't speak Dutch (yet). How much will this isolate me in the beginning? How big/accessible is the international community?
4. What do you love/hate the most about life in Leuven?
5. In terms of culture &amp; social atmosphere, good music, good food, architecture, natural beauty, etc)
6. Any other thoughts? Advice? :-)

It's a bit useless to start a debate on - for example - the current BHV case on here because a lot of the opinions are from actual Flemish people. I find it a bit discriminating that lots of those articles are one sided.

Could it also be that we (as I am myself a Flemish Belgian) are more influenced by the large internet presence of people from the Netherlands? Or is it the lack of popular Belgian forums whereas the Walloons are more connected to the actual French people and thus go to French internet websites?

tl;dr: Why is dutch speaking community so largely represented on this subreddit?

IMO we should say 'Dutch' and then Flemish is more a variant of Dutch with the 'dialects'.

UPDATE: Thanks so much to everyone who responded and especially to the young  Canadian lady in Brussels who offered to loan our daughter some money until we got things straightened out.  
  
She was able to get to a bank today and access her funds. It turns out that her card will not work at merchant terminals but will work at the bank so she's ok now. She's going to open an account at a local bank so she can avoid expensive fees withdrawing her money.  
  
Once again

Most importantly, I have the right to remain silent, and if cops can detain me without arresting me on the grounds of “reasonable suspicion”.

1286410261.0,dntjh,Just back from my one day trip to your beautiful country. ,Sanit,12,2,12,"What can I say? Every one was so friendly and the country is a thing of beauty. Great beers

First we visited the Cantillon brewery and tried some of their beers. It was a great experience and the staff were beyond welcoming to us. Then we set off to try and get into the city center. We saw a bus going in the right direction and we tried to ask the bus driver where he was going etc, and then back to us in English. Instead of getting on his bus, he walked us across town, over to the Metro station, and put us on a train. He told another person on the train to tell us when to get off and he left. Sure enough, the other passenger told us when to get off and there we were, in the heart of Brussels. Your people are so kind and helpful. We can't begin to thank you enough. 

We found our way to the Grand Place and had some waffles with chocolate and then tried to find Delirium Cafe. It took us 30 mins, but it was a good place for us to start. The beer was fantastic (not to mention the free beer we got because it was the end of the barrel) and the atmosphere was really relaxed. The staff there were so passionate about the beer they had and they were so helpful. I must have had 6 or 7 different beers and sampled about 10 more. You guys really know how to make beer. 

After some steak at a small restaurant, as they had no taps, just a fridge 1.50 beer. There must have been 30 people there, but everyone welcomed us as we sang and danced with the Spanish band upstairs. It was fantastic. 

They are only some of the highlights of the trip

Thanks Belgium

I have a German friend who doesn't know belgian beers. She tried a Delirium Tremens a few weeks ago and liked it

I have bought:

- Hoegaarden Grand Cru

- Affligem Tripel

- Saint Feuillien Grand Cru

- Chimay Grande Réserve (bleue)

- Omer

- La Trappe Quadrupel
 

Thing is

I think we will drink no more than 2 or 3 beers at a time (like in one evening) to avoid loosing out on flavours.

So if some connoisseurs could give me some advice for a degustation of these beers

-------------

Bonjour la Belgique !

J'ai une amie allemande qui ne connais pas les bières belges (elle a juste gouté une delirium tremens ya pas longtemps

Je suis pas spécialiste des bières mais j'ai remarqué que l'ordre dans lequel on les bois influe beaucoup sur l'appréciation qu'on en a.

Je pensais boire 2 ou 3 bières à la suite

Donc si des amateurs de bières ont des recommendations pour l'ordre de dégustation je suis preneur !

* Lived in the place for 14 month and we're now moved out. 
* The lease is registered with the city.
* We gave notice (via email) on Jan 29 that we want to leave on April 30th. Landlord deems this an insufficient period of time for the notice (less than 3 months) and threatens with 2 months indemnity (since it's after first year).
* An expert visited when we moved in and out. 
* We cooperate with finding a new tenant and one is found to move in a day after we leave. Landlord had verbally agreed to ""charge very little"" of the indemnity if we cooperate like this.
* Upon move out
* Also included in the assessment is wood floor treatment for 499 euro that was not performed while we were there nor before. He offered to have it done for us but we never actually needed it and never scheduled to have it done. The floor was in same condition when we arrived as when we left.
* I asked the landlord to remove the wood treatment and to reduce the cleaning. He replies that there's no negotiation and it's take it or leave it. He's threatening to go to court and to pursue in addition the two months indemnity that he is not otherwise assessing.

We have reason to believe that previous tenant also ran into financial disputes with this landlord.

Can anyone explain how these landlord/tenant court disputes go? Do lawyers get involved? Is it a quick process? Can it be done entirely via phone/email and without physically being there? 

Should we just suck it up and move on?

EDIT:
Follow up question: It's clear that the landlord has no plans on performing the work I'm being charged for by the expert (who I now believe is a friend of the landlord). The new tenants moved in less than 24 hours after I moved out. Normally in the US the landlord shows the tenant receipts for the work/fixes performed when taking some of the deposit.

My husband and I will be traveling to Belgium
Here is our tentative itinerary for the trip.  Would love to hear suggestions…  Spend more/less time in X city, bike, outdoor skate, eat great food, drink beer, visit crazy local sites, meet fun local people, see some trees…  We’re on a relatively small budget.


We’re planning to couch surf, and homestays with roller derby teams.  I play flat track roller derby in the united states and we’re hoping to get in touch with local leagues for possible homestays.  I will also be skating in a bout against the Paris Roller Girls on Saturday June 1st in Paris.  The only non-flexible dates are the Tuesday night in Antwerp and the Saturday bout in Paris.  Everything else is technically up in the air and can be moved around.  


Friday - Arrive in Brussels

Saturday – Brussels or day trip to Brugge &amp; the coast

Sunday – Brussels market

Monday – Ghent or day trip to Orval Brewery

Tuesday – head to Antwerp

Wednesday – Antwerp

Thursday- Antwerp

Friday – Antwerp &amp; travel to Paris

Saturday –Paris

Sunday-Paris

Monday-Paris 

Tuesday-Paris ? or back to Belgium?

Wednesday – open day

Thursday – travel to Amsterdam

Friday – Amsterdam

Saturday – fly out from Amsterdam in the morning




**Things we want to do

-Visit the Orval Brewery.  It’s one of my husband’s favorites and our cat is named Orval

-Visit Chaumont-Gistoux

-Shop at a big market - read that Brussels has a nice one on Sundays?  But is there a better one elsewhere we should go to instead?

-Not quite sure where to best fit Ghent in

1368716851.0,1egcw9,De Post: a Customers tale.,aDuckling,10,1,17,"On a lazy Sunday morning i decided to bake my all time favorite dessert: macarons. However




This creature of beauty and wonder was covered in dried raspberry sprinkles, and decided to try and research if i could purchase freeze dried berries in Belgium. Sadly, my frantic searches on the internet proved futile, so i turned back to Reddit, deeply saddened by the loss of a not yet even conceived Macaron.


Suddenly an idea sprung into my head


After posting a request for an exchange i found myself an exchange partner




Due to a thesis that claimed all my time




BELGIAN CUSTOMS it read, of which i only retained ""TAX"" ""60 euros"".
I didn't know what to do with the letter
As my exchange package would be around € 20 of value


I filled in the customs paper



A week later the postman knocked on the door, when the fellow exclaimed ""Oh dear! I forgot to scan in the package, i can't give it to you!"" I tried to grab the package out of his hands, but he dived away underneath my grabbyhands, and ran away again with my package. 



On monday i stayed on alert all day, craving to hear the sound of his motorcycle. Around 1PM i grew suspicious, and walked to my letterbox, only to discover he still hadn't digested the attack from Friday. All my post was laying in my letterbox, no package to be seen. A small card read ""Postman SCARYPANTS tried to deliver a package today, but no one was home. You can go and get your package as of tomorrow, at the grocery-store."" 
Deeply saddened by this outrageous lie i sunk down in my front-yard
I suddenly noticed something. In big letters there was something typed in the Due amount,4€""




I threw down my card, that after listening to my tale told me that i indeed shouldn't be paying almost 100% tax on a &lt;23€ package. He told me he would request a recalculation. I didn't have high hopes, after some experiences with other customer services promises, but i decided to wait anyway.
