1366820689.0,1d0n7o,Is it OK to split long functions and methods into smaller ones even though they won't be called by anything else?,exizt,74,10,32,"Lately I've been trying to split long methods into several short ones. 

For example: I have a 'process_url()' function which splits URLs into components and then assigns them to some objects via their methods. Instead of implementing all this in one function, which then passes the components to 'assign_components()' function. 

At first

However

Continuing previous example: someone looking at the code might think that 'process_components()' functionality is abstracted into a function because it's called by various methods and functions

This seems somewhat wrong. The alternative is to still write long methods and functions

Is the function-splitting technique I described wrong? What is the preferred way of managing large functions and methods?

**UPD:** I've also posted this question to [programmers.stackexchange.com](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/195989/is-it-ok-to-split-long-functions-and-methods-into-smaller-ones-even-though-they/195992?noredirect=1#195992)",,t5_2wk7l,1366821829.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/comments/1d0n7o/is_it_ok_to_split_long_functions_and_methods_into/

Notice redundancies. It is error prone and you have to make same change for backup as for the main. Using functions not only makes this more clearer but more maintainable. Here is a version that uses functions:

    void SpecialClass::update(const Data&amp; dependendData){
       if(GetType() == SPECIAL_TYPE){
           _updateSource(m_mainData
           _updateSource(m_backupData

    }
    //updates main source and backup data
    void SpecialClass::_updateSource(SourceData&amp; src

       const String&amp; srcBackup = src.getBackupData();
       _tranformData(srcData

I find the code below highly readable. If you don't agree

I particularly like the token (regex) definitions:

    grammar Brackets::Balanced {
        token TOP      { ^ &lt;balanced&gt;? $ };
        token balanced { '[' &lt;balanced&gt;? ']' &lt;balanced&gt;? };

This defines two regexes:

* **TOP** matches a given input string from start (\^) to finish ($) against another regex called ""balanced"".
* **token balanced** expresses a simple recursive balanced brackets parser (elegantly imo).

Imo this is highly readable

    grammar Brackets::Balanced {
        method ACCEPTS($string) { ?self.parse($string) }
    }

* This code defines an ACCEPTS method in the Brackets::Balanced grammar (just like one can define a method in a class).
* The ACCEPTS method parses/matches any strings passed to it (via the parse method
* The ? prefix means the method returns True or False.

These two lines of testing code might be the most inscrutable so far:

    say ""[][]"" ~~ Brackets::Balanced;
    say ""][""   ~~ Brackets::Balanced;

* These lines are instantly readable if you code in Perl 6 but I get that a newcomer might think ""wtf"" about the ~~ feature (which is called ""smart match"").
* The ~~ passes the thing on its left to the ACCEPTS method of the thing on its right. Thus the first say line says True,False,,t5_2wk7l,1370290011.0,,,t3_1fle60

Like if you never use semicolons as promoted in the second link but need to take care of some edge cases

Isn't code more robust if you add semicolons

And what do you do with colleagues with just average skill? I know for a fact that a lot of them will not understand the issues. Does that invalidate them as developers?

the basics of code readability with great explanations. The whole book can be [downloaded from here](http://books.cat-v.org/computer-science/elements-of-programming-style/elements_of_programming_style.pdf) (PDF warning).

(Summary is partly also composed from http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~zs/comp20006_2011_s2/resources/style.pdf)

     1. Write clearly -- don't be too clever.

     2. Say what you mean
     3. Use library functions whenever feasible.
     4. Write clearly -- don't sacrifice clarity for ""efficiency.""
     5. Let the machine do the dirty work.
     6. Replace repetitive expressions by calls to common functions.
     7. Don't strain to re-use code; reorganize instead.

     8. Avoid unnecessary branches.
     9. Don’t use conditional branches as a substitute for a logical expression.
    10. Take care to branch the right way on equality.

    11. Parenthesize to avoid ambiguity.
    12. Choose variable names that won't be confused.
    13. Avoid temporary variables.
    14. Use the good features of a language; avoid the bad ones.
    15. Use the ""telephone test"" for readability.

    16. Make your programs read from top to bottom.
    17. Use the fundamental control flow structures.
    18. Use data arrays to avoid repetitive control sequences.
    19. Avoid gotos if you can keep the program readable.
    20. Avoid multiple exits from loop.
    21. Be careful if a loop exits to the same place 
        from the middle and the bottom.

    21. Write first in easy-to-understand pseudo language; 
        then translate into whatever language you have to use.
    22. Follow each decision as closely as possible with its associated action.
    23. Don't stop with your first draft.

    24. Modularize. Use subroutines.
    25. Choose a data representation that makes the program simple.
    26. Let the data structure the program.
    27. Make the coupling between modules visible.
    28. Each module should do one thing well.
    29. Make sure every module hides something.
    30. Write and test a big program in small pieces.
    31. Use recursive procedures for recursively-defined data structures.

    32. Initialize all variables before use.
    33. Test input for plausibility and validity.
    34. Make sure input doesn't violate the limits of the program.
    35. Terminate input by end-of-file marker
    36. Identify bad input; recover if possible.
    37. Make input easy to prepare and output self-explanatory.
    38. Make input easy to proofread.
    39. Use uniform input formats.
    40. Use self-identifying input. Allow defaults. Echo both on output.

    41. Make sure your code does ""nothing"" gracefully.
    42. Program defensively.
    43. Fix all warnings reported by the compiler.
    44. Don’t patch bad code — rewrite it.

    45. Test programs at their boundary values.
    46. Don't compare floating point numbers solely for equality.

    47. Make it right before you make it faster.
    48. Make it fail-safe before you make it faster.
    49. Make it clear before you make it faster.
    50. Make it right when you make it faster.

    51. Don't sacrifice clarity for small gains in ""efficiency.""
    52. Let your compiler do the simple optimizations.
    53. Make sure special cases are truly special.
    54. Keep it simple to make it faster.
    55. Don't diddle code to make it faster -- find a better algorithm.
    56. Instrument your programs. Measure before making ""efficiency"" changes.

    57. Make sure comments and code agree.
    58. Don't just echo the code with comments -- make every comment count.
    59. Don't comment bad code -- rewrite it.
    60. Use names that mean something.
    61. Format a program to help the reader understand it.
    62. Document your data layouts.
    63. Document reason for decisions.
    64. Don't over-comment.

To select all elements on the page that are within a paragraph tag:

    $('p')

To select all elements on the page with the CSS class 'active':

    $('.active')

To select the element with the ID 'container':

    $('#container')

To select all div elements with the class 'active':

    $('div.active')

To select all paragraph elements that is within a div with the class of 'active':

    $('div.active p')

To select the 4th list item from an unordered list (note that eq is zero-based):

    $('li:eq(3)')

You could also select the 4th item from an unordered list this way (not zero-based):

    $('li:nth-child(4)')

Select all descendants of an element with the class 'active' that has the class 'selection' then all descendants of the .selection class that are the second paragraph elements:

    $('.active .selection p:eq(1)')

Note that above

    &lt;div class=""active""&gt;
        &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I will be selected&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;div class=""buffer""&gt;
            &lt;span class=""choice""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neither will I&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

There is the direct descendant selector. This tells jQuery to select only from the immediate child of the parent element:

    $('.active &gt; .selection p:eq(1)')

Here is the HTML from the previous example that shows what will be selected when using the direct descendant selector. Notice that only the .selection that is the first child of the .active will be selected:

    &lt;div class=""active""&gt;
        &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I will be selected&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;div class=""buffer""&gt;
            &lt;span class=""choice""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neither will I&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neither will I&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Lets say you have a bunch of div elements. Each will be assigned a CSS class based on their data. Your classes are DebitCash, CreditCard. You want to select all divs that have a class that begins with Debit:

    $('div[class^=""Debit""]')

Using the above example

I typically create a class called Config and use the following methods to get/set the settings within the app.config.

        private static Configuration _config = null;
        private static void SetValue(String key
        {
            _config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.None);

            _config.Save(ConfigurationSaveMode.Modified);
        }
        private static String GetValue(String key)
        {
            //Need to call refresh section to pull any changed values
            ConfigurationManager.RefreshSection(""appSettings"");
            String retVal = String.Empty;
            try
            {
                retVal = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get(key);
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                return String.Empty;
            }
            return retVal;
        }
        private static bool GetValueAsBool(String key)
        {
            String val = GetValue(key);
            return !String.IsNullOrEmpty(val) &amp;&amp; bool.Parse(val);
        }
        private static int GetValueAsInt(String key)

            String val = GetValue(key);
            return String.IsNullOrEmpty(val) ? 0 : Int32.Parse(val);
        }


The property typically looks something like:

        public static String ConnectionString
        {
            get { return GetValue(""ConnectionString""); }
            set { SetValue(""ConnectionString""
