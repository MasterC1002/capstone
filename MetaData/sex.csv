1353336672.0,13g9w5,Had my girl's eyes rolling around in her head. Confirmation of advice we see a lot. Thanks /r/sex!,TooHappyFappy,5987,2350,641,"So yesterday I decide to

First, I started telling my girlfriend (23F) how attracted to her I was. ""You look beautiful today,"" ""There's so many things I want to do to you right now,"" ""I can't wait to rip your clothes off tonight,"" etc. I progressed like that, building up from simple compliments to explicit details of exactly what I wanted to do.

So we eat at my sister's, I just had a hand on her the entire drive. Hand on leg, hand on head, subtle brushing of her boob, not so subtle dive between her legs. She had to change for volleyball, since we were going to be pushing the limit on how much time she had to get there. She changes in the car and had planned to be as discreet as possible. I told her I wanted her to do it slowly, so I could glance over and see her in different states of undress. She's normally pretty timid about stuff like that, but I still made her go outside her comfort zone a bit. (She told me later it made her really hot).

I sit and watch her play volleyball. I give her my best ""I'm going to fuck you so hard"" eyes every time she looks at me. I could see her go flush every time.

We get home, in all the places she knows I love (neck, ears, sucking on my fingers). I let her do it, I let her know how hot it's making me... and then I stop her. I sit there, watching more football. Eventually she starts again, and we make out a bit. And then I stop her. And then she does it again, so she just lays down on the couch. I lay behind her. Eventually, not inserting my fingers. I play with her clit for a while, to get her to come with my fingers

I stand her up and take her pants off. She takes mine off and starts jerking me off. As she's doing this, and press it against her butt. She's shy with it normally, and I have to kind of press against and then wait for her approval. As we're making out and I press against it, she shoves back against it. Basically begging for my finger in her ass. I comply. I start slow and shallow, building my way up to faster and deeper. She's incredibly turned on.

I tell her to lay down. She takes off her shirt as she's doing this, squeezing, kissing, licking, sucking. Then I prop myself up like I'm ready to insert. I get to the point of being ready to... and then stop. I go back to playing with her boobs. She whimpers but I can tell she's enjoying it. I repeat this process 3-4 times. Finally I put the condom on and am ready to insert.

Because I've been playing with her so long and my dick hasn't had any attention for about 10 minutes, writhing, eyes rolling. Because of how hot this is, I get harder and harder (and subsequently bigger). Every second I get bigger, the crazier she goes. I held there for probably 2 minutes, as she's getting more and more pleasure out of it.

Eventually I start thrusting in and out slowly. She's enjoying it so much. She tells me she's getting ready to come... so I push all the way in and hold it there again. She's begging me to fuck her hard, then hold it all the way in. I do this two more times till she's begging me to let her finish. I finally comply, and she came so hard (making me come, too).

She was unable to move for 5 minutes. I would ask her questions, when I first inserted and was growing bigger and bigger, she thought she was going to die from ecstasy.

I thought /r/sex might be interested in some of the results that relate directly to sex on film. Here's a selection of some of the most interesting:

- The average female porn star weighs 48 lbs less than the average American woman and the average male weighs 27 lbs less than the average man.

- The most common cup size for a porn star isn't double-D

- Porn stars are more tattooed and pierced than the general population.

* **87% of female porn stars take a facial at least once in their careers, 39% a double penetration, 31% swallow, 28% do a 'creampie', 16% squirt, 10% do a double pussy penetration, and 5% do a double anal penetration.**

- Porn stars have been making their anal debuts sooner over the last 30 years. In the '80s they waited about two years

- The most common female sex roles for women in porn film titles are: teen, cheerleader, nurse...

- The most common first name for a female porn star is Nikki. For men it's David. The most common last name for both genders is the same:  Lee.

Pretty simple. I was wondering if I could get a yeast infection from having sex with uncooked pizza dough. Should I wear a condom? These might seem like pretty stupid questions. I had a fairly sheltered childhood and I don't know much about sex. 

Just to clarify

So

Edit 1: Just to clarify, it appears that it's safe to have sex with pizza dough. 

Edit 1.5?: I appear to have a poor internet connection. So if I reply to the same person several times

Edit 2: I'm starting to think I should have used a throwaway.

Edit 3: Woah. Reddit Gold. I really didn't expect that to come from a thread about me ""wanting to fuck pizza dough"". But thank you very much.

Also, I'll do an AMA in [/r/CasualIAMA](/r/CasualIAMA) tomorrow around 3 pm CST, saying how it was and all that stuff. Thanks everyone for all your help!

While I was waiting for her to come back from his place today (again...) I decided to check her Facebook and Gmail

To sum it up

I then confronted her with all the emails and messages, but according to her with was with a condom, I don't believe in this because she takes the pill, so I'm going to get tested for STD's this week.

1333496725.0,rrzr6,I'm a mute girl who for the first time moaned during sex. Let me tell you about it. ,ididntsayanything,7325,4696,1284,"Throwaway. I meant to do this yesterday

I am a 26 year old female mute (selective mutism) with a boyfriend of 3 years who I have never spoken a word to. No sounds, and my bf is only the 3rd person on this planet that has heard my adult voice. 

Here are the nitty gritty details because I know that's what you want:

It was Sunday night, winding down from the day. I go to the sink to wash our dishes when he sneaks from behind me and embraces me. I instantly know what time it is (no words necessary). He kisses my cheek, my neck and strokes my hair all while holding me so close to himself. I can feel his heart racing in his chest against my back. All of sudden he turns me around and lifts me onto the counter. I am really taken aback by his forcefulness, but I like it. He rips off my jeans and starts kissing my belly which eventually leads to him giving me oral while I sit on the kitchen sink. God, it was good. He then lifts me off the sink, turns me around, bends me over and proceeds to bang the shit out of me from behind. He is so strong and forceful. I am hanging to the faucet and a cabinet door for dear life. He has one of my breast in one hand and his other hand between my legs while he's nibbling on my ear. It's so overwhelming (in a good way). I feel like I'm about to pull this cabinet door off the hinges, and everything just feels amazing; I'm completely in heaven when it happens: I let out a moan. A completely visceral and unplanned moan. It scared me a little and him too apparently because he completely stopped moving and craned his neck over my shoulder. He had the most confused and shocked look on his face. He asks if I'm okay, but when I did

For anyone reading, but who knows. I put his face as my background and have been practicing saying ""Good morning"". 

Edit: Wow!! I was actually secretly hoping that this would get buried. A lot of you guys are asking about mutism and my relationship, which is why I don't really mind sharing such an intimate part of my life. It's just a part of life. As a child, I was super anxious to the point where I would freeze up when people would approach me. My parents tried therapy, but just didn't work. They expected too much, too soon. The saving graces in my life are my brother and sister. They have never once treated differently. They would beat me up and make fun of me, but with love. They understood me and just accepted me and just let me live. My older sister use to, and still does, but college was awesome (my brother went to the same school). I found a niche with the pre-med/psychology students who thought it was cool. Having outside friends who didn't care that I never talked really opened me up. I guess the best form of therapy I've ever had is living life with a few good people. College is where I met my boy. We had the same group of friends.  He's really patient. I mean REALLY patient. He wanted to go on a date (I don't know why), nods, but to at least give me a way to express myself if we're fighting or something. Again

 If you're wondering, but it's okay.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,True,,

He told me he had seen something he wanted to try. So I was thinking BJ-stuff, when he started to lay his hands on me, I thought I was going to fall apart. He was grinning constantly because I was moaning non-stop. So much good feelings! He played with my clit and ate me out for over an hour, and when I orgasmed I thought it was going to die. Couldn't really do anything for a few minutes and then went on giving him head for an hour and gave him an amazing orgasm too. :) good times! 

Really felt like telling someone! I've been smiling constantly

1353959860.0,13tu08,"My ""How-To"" Guide for Men on How To Dominate a Woman in Bed ;)",sodomize_intolerance,4358,1870,576,"So inspired from my post in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13s4c9/women_of_reddit_what_does_your_man_do_that_makes/c76orzq) and all the positive responses and comments I received

So first off, and then progress to things like ""rape""/light BDSM play. I also had some questions on how to do ""dirty talk"" so I'm gonna add in some suggestions/examples throughout the guide of things you can say (they will be in quotations).

So first things first, make sure you define your boundaries, and STICK TO THEM. It's always better for her to ask you to take things further later on, than for you to take things too far without her permission and ruin the experience and make her reluctant for her to want to try again! So establish boundaries, come up with a safe word (even if you don't think you need one...fantasies are one thing, actual enactment of them is another, she may not actually enjoy the reality of it once she experiences it so always play safe than be sorry!), so please

Also, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Ask her if anything is wrong, MAKE SURE NOTHING IS WRONG. If you have any doubt in your mind, just stop. If she uses the safeword, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Give her a second to relax and decompress. Talk to her about it, get her to communicate what went wrong. Please, please DO NOT continue

Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT, and I'm hoping SOME people will find it helpful/interesting. But this will vary from girl to girl.

Now let's get things started ;)

**""Gentle"" Dominating**

- Push her against the wall/bed/floor/table. Hold down her wrists (above her head, sweetheart.""

- Manhandle her. Put your hands all over her as if you can't get enough. Grab her breasts

- Kiss her like you need it to breathe. Grab her chin and pull her mouth to yours

- Run your fingers through her hair and pull gently. Tug her hair so that it forces her to look up at you

- Grind your hips against her

**Getting more aggressive...**

- Light scratching: Use your fingernails and scratch along her back or lightly dig your nails into her ass.

- Spanking: Slap her ass. Mix it up, grip it with your hand, slap it, etc. ""I fucking love your tight little ass"". ""This beautiful ass is all mine...in fact I think I should leave a mark so you'll remember who it belongs to *slap*"".

- Biting: Bite her nipples

- Orgasm Denial: ""Do you want to cum?""

- Forced Orgasms: ""I want you to cum NOW."" ""Come for me, I think I want to do it again...""  *Make her cum again.*

- Have sex with clothes on. Ideal if she's wearing a dress/skirt - hike up her dress and fuck her like that. If she has pants

- Make her pleasure you. Force her on her knees and suck you off. ""Get on your knees now."" ""You're going to suck me until I'm satisfied."" ""Suck me with that talented little mouth of yours.""

**""Rape""/Light BDSM**
- So please, if at any time she says the safe word, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Pay attention to her body language - if it appears like she is not enjoying something or starting to hesitate, STOP IMMEDIATELY, ask her if everything is okay, MAKE SURE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY OKAY. Again, please DO NOT continue if you have any doubts whatsoever. Constantly monitor her and your actions throughout this - remember your boundaries, find resources and do your research

- Gagging: Gag her with a piece of cloth, and shoves them in my mouth. (Because your mouth will be gagged, you must have a ""safe gesture"" as a sign to stop if things get too much.)

- Bondage: Buy rope, four-poster bed restraints, etc. OR improvise and substitute with a scarf or belt. Tie up her wrists behind her back (then force her to suck you off), tie her to the bed frame and tease her. Safety point: NEVER leave someone tied up alone in a room (if you need to leave to go to the bathroom or anything like that, make sure you can hear her if she calls out to you. NEVER LEAVE SOMEONE GAGGED AND TIED UP.).

- Degrade her. Call her a dirty little slut/whore/cunt/bitch. ""The only thing you're good for is to be fucked/satisfying me.""  Make her degrade herself ""What are you?"" ""What are you good for?"" ""You're my slutty little whore. Say it."" If she hesitates, punish her until she gets it right. Make her call you ""Sir"" or ""Master"". Punish her every time she forgets to refer to you as that.

- In contrast to degradation (as pointed out by you guys!): Praise her for satisfying you so well and being *your* ""good little girl/slave"". Tell her how pleased you are with her behavior and how good she's pleased you. Reward her.

Questions are very welcome!! Please also share your own comments that you've found fun in the bedroom!! Thanks for reading and hope you have lots of sexy times ;)

**After care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your partner after - make sure she/he is okay, kiss, hold, cuddle her/him, tell them you love them, etc, etc.**

**Edit: Thanks so much for the amazing feedback and responses! Please keep them coming and share your experiences so we can all enjoy ;)**

**A great comment by signhereplease: Make her taste herself. After you finger her put your finger in her mouth

**From LyssaBrisby who pointed out a GREAT perspective for those who are not into the whole degradation scene but who are still exploring their submissive side: Not all submission is to do with ""naughty/bad"" stereotypes; in fact I think there's a fully parallel stream that is ""noble submission, not a bad/dirty one.**

First off, I have no rectum (permanent colostomy, not even a hole down there) and no reproductive system - no vagina, and no clitoris. Growing up like that sucked hard, but I survived. Met a great guy that didn't mind me not having a vagina. I thought life would be ok. Got a good job, with insurance. It was finally time to look in to reconstructive surgery, just to get some semblance of normality. You can't begin to understand how difficult pleasing a guy is when you can't have sex, at all, yes? 

Turns out, by the way, your blood work shows you're actually male. 

That... is a hell of a thing to discover at 34 years old. I cracked. Completely lost my mind for a while. I turned to my best friend, and you can't make an artificial penis for an infant. They told my Mom as I left the hospital as an infant. She never ""found the right time"" to tell me. That was a bombshell. My mental state degraded a bit more after I lost my job - I couldn't stay on task, got very depressed.

I know I'm not the only fucked up person in the world. So what the hell am I supposed to do? I've been transgendered my whole life and never knew. Tho, but I always rationalized it as ""best friend"" feelings that were probably normal. 

If anyone has questions,000. And less than 1/3 of those cases were gender reassigned (according to Dr. Gearhart at Johns Hopkins). If I did my math right, that's less than 400 people like me in the United States. To use a phrase another of my doctors used, I'm ""rare as rocking horse shit"". 

I don't want to ramble. My illusion that I'll ever have a shred of normality in my life is shattered. I just want to know if anyone else has some sage advice on how a person like myself can move on from something like this. Am I destined to die alone

Okay, my boyfriend has never been able to get me off"", I thought I was doing pretty good.

I've always been skeptical about videos that teach you how to become a dramatically better lover / sexual partner in a short 20-minute lesson, during the halftime of the Bulls/Nets game, I put on the video and watched.

When she came home (she worked late)

1.  Pinching and wiggling the vulva
2.  Sucking pussy with a consistent pressure

HOLY FUCK

Seriously.

HOLY FUCK.

What went down:

* I laid next to her and just pinched her pussy - that's all.  Just pinched it and held it relatively tight.  If I recall correctly, but watching her with this slow build-up is 500x more satisfying.  She afterwards described it as 'tortuous pleasure'.

* I sucked on her pussy for about 15 minutes straight - just consistent suction.  I didn't have to really do much of anything - I let her grind up against me (like Hartley suggests in the video) so it wasn't tongue-numbing like oral sex can sometimes be.  It's the most she's ever enjoyed oral sex (as far as I can tell)

* I didn't use any internal finger stimulation

* She came within the first two thrusts of sex.  And it's one of the hardest (if not the hardest) she's ever come.  I'm talking like several minutes straight of intense orgasm with more minutes of twitching afterwards.

* She slept like a baby afterwards

Lessons learned:

* The pussy is way sturdier than I thought.  I kept increasing how hard I was grabbing her pussy (I have a strong grip from farmers walks and deadlifts) and I found that it was pretty much impossible to be grabbing too hard.  I guess I kind of knew that because we both enjoy fairly rough sex

* Consistent suction on the pussy is a godsend.  Greatest thing ever.

* You can get a woman off 10x better with 1/10th of the work you're putting in right now.  Seriously.  It's unbelievable how hard technique trumps effort.

* Treat the clit like a penis.  I'd heard it said before that the clit is a minature penis

TLDR: **Another testimonial for the Nina Hartley / Sunny Lane video**.

In closing

&gt; HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE!? I mean, bumbling with my canvas, sloppily and haphazardly tossing paint on it.

This is getting ridiculous.,fuckingisthebest,4730,2625,939,"A lot of people seem to be under the impression that a female's anatomy changes drastically with every sexual experience she has. Where is this coming from?

I feel like every day someone asks why their girlfriend's pussy isn't as tight as their ex's- even though she's only had sex once in her life! Does this mean she lied? No! Jesus. NO. I mean,"" that's just how her vagina is. It's a vagina. It might need to fit a penis in it. Its tightness is determined by a combination of genetics, level of relaxation, arousal, and muscle tone. Having had multiple penises/dildos inside does not permanently stretch out a vagina. That's not how it works. 

And equally absurd are these labia myths. Some women have longer labia than others. That's literally all there is to it. It has no correlation with ""tightness"" *or* the amount of sex she's had. Why would that even make sense? I have long inner labia

How did these myths ever become so prevalent? Not only is it ignorant, and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/hrfnn/my_favourite_view/), and nearly bursting into tears. *warning- these links contain some upsetting language you may wish to avoid*

There's a lot of both ignorance and slut shaming. It's absurd. It's really really not cool. It has the potential to make someone feel like shit. It's not anyone's fault for being uninformed, and if you're a shitty person and like to make people feel bad, carry on- nothing I can do. And I'm not talking about voicing an opinion or having a preference. I'm talking about language designed to hurt people. Additionally, I think we should be able to talk/joke about whatever we want. It's sad that it's often so mean spirited, but there should not be any limits placed on what we're ""allowed to"" joke about. It's our job as individuals to learn what sort of stuff makes us feel bad and avoid it. I just wanted to provide some information and ask everyone to be a little thoughtful, particularly when someone is putting themselves in a vulnerable position, and too be a little sensitive to our potential insecurities.

Tightness, have absolutely nothing to do with a woman's sexual history. You can't actually deduce anything. Plus, her history is her business, so it's even more ridiculous to discuss or preach these erroneous deductions. 

Same goes for male analogues- I just see less of it in my life so that's not my focus here. I'm sure it happens all the time with things like circumcision and penis size. That's also totally shitty. But we're all different- it's really that simple. Why can't we just enjoy our own and each others' bodies for what they are?  Hopefully we are becoming more and more enlightened thanks to places like this

**Edit 1:** Come on guys, and it happens to be something I've dealt with personally. That is why I posted about pussies.

**Edit 2:** Just curious about the personal attacks- why is this post inspiring so much rage toward me?

**Edit 3:** I don't actually know much about the effects of childbirth

**Edit 4:** To everyone inquiring- *my* pussy is not particularly loose, I've managed to fit some very large dicks in there when properly relaxed, wet, and prepped. I do have longish inner labia. *Both of these features have been consistent throughout my sexual life.* I can't speak to whether any of you would be attracted or repulsed by me- nor can you really, since you haven't seen it, but I've had people say I'm tight, say my pussy is pretty,"" pretty much everything. As much as I'm enjoying the conjectures as to the color, I thought I should step in and at least give you some info to back it up. TL;DR: it kinda just looks like a pussy. Carry on.

I think its something most people enjoy doing and has to be pretty standard. But coming from the girl who has on multiple occasions told me that she would rather slit her wrists than touch my dick with her mouth had me kinda shocked. What happened next is what blew my mind.

I kinda wanted to stay on my high horse and in a sexy voice told her I just wanted her now. She responded with ""No you need to earn it."" I kinda got up. Was instantly out of the mood an tried really hard not to laugh at her. She looked confused and asked what my problem was. I simply looked into her eyes and said ""I am not in the mood anymore"" which was 100% true. 

She immediatly got extremely butt hurt and started bitching to me about how I am an ass and would not let me get a word in edge wise. I was taking the insults just fine until she raised her voice. As soon as she started yelling I got out of bed grabbed her clothes and proceeded to throw them out my front door and told her to get the fuck out. 

Where do girls get off thinking that they can require a guy to do the very same thing that they would never do. I am sorry ladies but passion and sex is a give and take process. If you want sex to be all about you then grab your favorite toy and go to your room and do what you gotta do.

And I love being naked

I had a threesome with my partner with another girl and she was so shy being naked and I didn't understand. She had the perfect body. She looked like a goddess to me

And then it hit me. I had my own personal cheer leader. In the morning, ""yay, naked!"" and then when I put on clothes he would always say, ""aww, clothes?"" which would make me smile. I could be coming out of the shower and he would say, ""Vagina!"" (yes, I know, etc.

Basically, I am encouraged to be naked and he lets me know that he loves to see my body. It isn't always sexual (although sometimes it is) and he does it to make me laugh more than turn me on. But it's honestly like having my own cheerleader that follows me around and let's me know that I'm beautiful, wanted, and that imperfections are in the eye of the beholder, and I don't have to worry when he's the one doing the beholding.

I wasn't always comfortable being naked, it sinks in. Just like if you are teased for a long time, you start to believe what they say, if you are cheered on, celebrated, and appreciated for long periods of time, you eventually just come to accept that dammit

So partners of those that are more shy or less confident, you can still be a cheerleader and let them know you appreciate every facet of their being.

**CAUTION**: Increasing your mental control of these muscles and their physical strength can cause you to emit an irresistible aura of a sexual super here. People will throw themselves at... just kidding. Real reason for caution: You can eventually get strong enough that as you flex, use common sense. Never squeeze so hard you are causing yourself significant discomfort or any pain at all. If you do experience pain, stop immediately, and allow the muscles to heal for a few days before continuing at a *decreased intensity*.


**What can you gain from Kegels?**


*Male bodied people:*


-Stronger orgasms
-Potential to become FULLY multiply orgasmic (see ""Why I'm qualified to write this guide""
-Easier
-Greater orgasm control
-Greater ejaculate volume
-Increased sexual health
-Ability to flex and stimulate your partner. (More for a smile and a ""Wow"" than for intense physical pleasure.)
-Help to maintain erectile function as you age
-Increased prostate health
-Increased libido (my theory
-Massively increased confidence because of all of the above


*Female bodied people:*


-Increased orgasm strength
-Increased orgasm control
-Increased potential to become multiply orgasmic
-Increased potential to learn how to orgasm via different stimulation types (clitoral
-Increased potential to learn how to ejaculate
-Increased vaginal tightness and ability to physically manipulate your partner using your vaginal muscles. (Massive ""Wow"" factor. Some women can produce orgasm in their male-bodied partners using this alone
-Increased libido (my theory
-Increased sexual health and confidence because of all of the above


The pelvic floor muscles, I don't know). The whole group is incredibly complex, and is all up in your naughty bits. These are just the benefits and roles we know about. I'm sure their are lots we don't know about.


Male pelvic floor: http://prostatitis.hostei.com/images/male-pelvic-floor.jpg Female pelvic floor: http://promiscuouseating.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/perineal-muscles.jpg


Kegels are a conscious contraction, and can incorporate the abdominals. 


**Kegels and your Butt:**


Kegels do not require anal play, anal play. It is simply a biological fact. In order to perform Kegels properly, you will need to learn about how your body works, and this will require touching your anus briefly. If you have an aversion to this, I would encourage you to overcome it for the sake of your sexual health. You will only need to touch your anus once, during your first session. If you can not overcome this, you can still follow along and put your hand as close as you are comfortable to your anus without touching it


**Establishing the Mind-Body Connection with the Muscle Group:**


Right now, or to hold urine in when you need to go. If you are unable to do this, don't worry. Your body just hasn't established the mental connection with those muscles as strongly. In this case, wait until you are urinating. Once you have started, stop the flow of urine. You may not be able to fully stop the flow at first. Repeat the squeeze and release of those muscles a few times. This should be sufficient to have trained your brain what muscle groups to flex. After you are finished and dressed, flex the same muscles. If you can do so, excellent. If you require more practice


**Feeling what the Muscles Do


Once you can do this, or between your penis/vagina and anus. Now squeeze those muscles. You will feel your anus tighten and draw inwards. Male bodied people will feel the base of your penis firm up and push out and/or forward a bit. Female bodied people should feel a squeeze inside your vagina. If you do not feel these things, do not worry. At first your muscles may be weak, and the weaker the muscles, the less movement they produce. Contract and release the muscles a few times, and feel what they do to your body. 


Now, and hold the push for 5 seconds. Notice that while this push is *similar* it is **distinctly different** from pushing during a bowel movement. If it feels *absolutely identical* try to stay focused on the muscle group you were squeezing, and use your hands, touching your perineum, to strengthen the mind-body connection, and focus the push. 


Once you are able to do both the squeeze and push, push, relax, cycles that you feel you have good mental control of the muscle group, and can do them without your hands there to help focus. If you find you have lost some of that focus when you try your first 'hands free' session, just do some more 'hands on' work each time you are in bed until your control is good enough to be fully comfortable.


The push is extremely important, extending that range of motion). If you are *only* squeezing, you are progressively and repetitively flexing the muscle, without relaxing it. It would be similar to doing an arm curl with a weight, but only ever moving from fully contracted to 3 - 4"" away from your shoulder. There is *very little* benefit to doing 'half Kegels'. 


By exercising the full range of motion, extend it's range of motion. Also, for male-bodied people, you will use a combination of squeeze and push to delay orgasm during vigorous sexual activity.


**Kegels: The Exercise Routine**


So now you know how to perform Kegels


The cycle is squeeze, relax. The goal is to squeeze harder, and longer. Start wherever you are comfortable, perhaps 2 seconds each, for 30 cycles. The stronger you are naturally, the longer you will be able to hold initially. But no matter how weak those muscles are, they *will* strengthen over time


Long Holds: Work up to holding each stage for 30 seconds


Short Pulses: Squeeze for 3 seconds, rhythmic contraction of orgasm. They are not as good for increasing strength as the long hold type.


**Ok


In as short as 6 months, that's the super cool thing about them. While you will make incredible improvements over the next six months to two years, you will actually notice *huge* changes within a week or two. *If* you behave yourself and actually do them regularly, as in every day, ideally, or every second day. Also great news is once you've built up your strength over six months, or a couple years, do them twice a week to keep toned


Well

**EDIT 2: Many have asked for clarification on the push. I replied to the question in the comments

Everyone is clear on the squeeze it seems. I can't stress the importance of using your hands at first. As absolutekraze mentioned, but could feel it with a finger inside. Thanks for adding that absolutekraze :)

Some users have mentioned it's similar to pushing out urine. Maninachair put it well: ""Like when you are at a movie and don't want to miss to much so you pee as fast as possible and then it splashes back up on you and you're like well shit..."" That is partially it.

Some users have mentioned a similarity to pushing during a bowel movement. It is similar, very different. Do not push in the exact same way as you push a bowel movement. And do not push hard, and certainly not hard enough to cause a prolapse, as some have indicated.

This is the best explanation I can come up with:

Push exactly like a bowel movement for a second. Now push exactly like pushing out urine for a second. It's kind of half-way between the two. Now do a Kegel squeeze. From relaxed state, feel the way they are moving (you should be using your hands at first here). The push is to keep moving them a bit further in that direction, past just where they sit when relaxed.
From relaxed

As Maxxters mentioned in her comment, which is fully forcing the muscle to relax/extend in the opposite direction of the flex, and is so, so important, seems to never be mentioned. This is the main reason I made the post in the first place. I hope this has helped to clarify what it is. If it remains unclear, let's continue to work through it together :)",,self,,

Thanks for all the replies everyone. I didn't really expect this thread to be seen by as many people as it has been.  
  
Some of you seem to be concerned that I haven't spoken to my daughter about sex or puberty, she also knows she can get contraceptives from her doctor or a clinic, or a pharmacy, or a supermarket and I won't know about it. She also knows that she can get emergency contraception on the NHS just by walking into the doctors office or visiting a contraception clinic. Yeah i don't want to be a granddad yet.  
  
Now for the bit you've been waiting for. 
  
I had a conversation with my daughter about what happened to my toothbrush. She has admitted to taking the toothbrush, that she she never feel ashamed for masturbating e.t.c. but that using my tooth brush was not very clean (for either of us). I gave her my debit card and told her she could buy herself something from the internet to use, or if she want's her aunt can pick her something up. I told her that I won't know what she's bought, because I'll just get a generic product name on the bill, and that I will never go snooping around her stuff looking for it. I also made it clear that she could talk to her aunt (my sister is okay with this) if she ever needs a woman to talk to about anything. I do my best to keep informed, but as a man there are just some things I don't know. 

We'll now I'm off to buy a new toothbrush.

This really gives people bad ideas and makes them think that they could deal with someone fucking their SO or that they can compartmentalize sex from emotion.  The end result for most people is not happy if they go through with it

I'm not saying polyamorous or swinging is bad because obvious some people enjoy it and some like it, their fantasies should forever remain things that stay in their head.  I have fantasies sure, but I recognize that they are fantasies and not at all a representation of real life because real people never act or respond like they do in your own head.

1346165141.0,yyoii,Some thoughts on foreplay from a girl.,cunttastic,2968,1151,568,"Hello Sexxit
I wanted to discuss something that has come to my attention recently involving foreplay, etc. and I have checked with my group of girlfriends and they feel the same way. So here it is.

  As a woman, and other vaginal-focused activities. Personally, I need a few minutes to get there. I want to be at a point where I'm thinking ""Oh my god, I can't wait 'til he touches my pussy"" before you go there. Even though I'm excited, it's just not vagina-time yet. The things that turn me on the most are cuddling, touching all over (hands going up and down my body), making out, very wet, my partners (and friends' partners) try to incite excitement by going straight for the vagina. Honestly, I *am* horny I just need something other than this!'. I often tell my partners ""Hold on babe

Let me re-iterate: **I am only one woman.** This information may only be relevant to those of you in longer-term relationships, he actually has to *do less work* in order to get me physically ready for sex and orgasm. **You don't have to be an oral superstar, or master the best fingering techniques.** For a lot of women, non-specific affectionate play can make us physically and mentally prepared for sex much more effectively than anything else.

Even if you don't agree

**TL;DR: Try extensive cuddling

1351198841.0,1234ol,Semen Taste Experiment: Part 0,brassiron,2729,969,362,"**UPDATE #1** Previous readers please head to the bottom



**Warning:**

I am a young

**The Idea**

So the idea of drinking pineapple juice as a taste booster for semen has been floating around for sometime now. I'm sure we have all seen the comments and the claims. Well

**Background:**

After doing a bit of research and taking the mental leap that fructose content is responsible for semen taste I stumbled upon some researchers trying to limit fructose's effect on sperm of diabetics(Fructose kills and messes with sperm. The theory being that it's not there for the sperm but to kill the sperm of following rival males). It seems that diabetics have much higher levels of fructose in seminal plasma (Vitamin C seems to help

**The Plan:**

Next week will be my control. I will use a glucose monitor to test my blood sugar and make sure it stays in the normal levels. I will take semen samples from myself (for science) every few days and test pH using test strips and fructose levels(more on that later). After the week I will fast for 1 day and get a fasting blood sugar level. I will then incrementally change by diet to consist of food that will drive my blood sugar up (to higher but still safe levels) like processed carbs and fruit roll-ups(super high glycemic index/load). I will also do my best to maintain consistent levels of calories, salt and water. I will not be smoking(I rarely smoke anyway), drinking alcohol(kill me now) or coffee during this experiment. And I am a vegetarian already so no need to worry if meat is a factor.

**Analysis:**

I know what you are thinking

The Qualitative analysis (quality/taste) will come from my brave loving girlfriend (I promise it's for science and she likes it) since a. the consistency/texture of semen weirds me out and b. higher levels of blood glucose lead to higher glucose and fructose taste tolerances.

Quantitative Analysis is a bit more tricky. Fructose isn't very soluble in 95% ethanol while most other components of semen are. So I will just be used the ethanol to precipitate out the fructose and then weighing and analyzing for purity(additional washes of other solvent to remove impurities, refractive index, etc).


I will then use these results to try to draw a correlation between semen taste and the amounts and times I eat foods high in glucose i.e if I eat food ""A"" at time 1 and get my blood glucose level to level X

**TL:DR I'm testing if a diet high in glucose will make my semen taste sweeter as scientifically as I can without using my departments resources**

Thank you for reading all that (now you see why I'm not an English major). I would love to hear any comments, criticisms and questions that the good folks of Sexxit have. If any one would like to see any other the research I found just let me know; although much of it is hidden behind pay walls, I will do my best to get you the info.

EDIT: Forgot to mention I'm a vegetarian 

EDIT2: If anyone knows of a way I can I a control for my girlfriend's taste tests I would really appreciate it. I don't think saving the semen in a freezer or refrigerator and reheating it will be viable control. Anyway back to leaning about clinical taste tests

EDIT3: I seemed to have found some lab based taste test worksheets. Soooo what I am thinking I will be doing is homogenizing the sample and having my girlfriend compare it to known samples of fructose in water (which I will correct to the proper pH). 

EDIT4: For everyone that thinks I don't have have a girlfriend please take your hate elsewhere.P.S. She might be on later

EDIT5: Cropped one of the pics so that you can see the Reddit post better and removed the middle finger. It was a bit childish.It was only meant for one rude individual and you have my apologies if it offended anyone .Thanks to imnotlegolas for pointing that out to me. 

Thank you for all the responses. I am way more excited about this now since I kind of feel like you all are coming on a field trip with me. 

(10/26) So I have decided that the first update will be posted in a new thread. If anyone has any issues with this or anything else please let me know I'm trying my best to respond to as many comments as I can. That step will be done in about a week and will consist of my finalized complete procedure, I regret to inform you that this will not result in an increase in my blowjob frequency (the opposite actually). To keep things as consistent as possible blowjobs (lolabeans jaw is cheering, she has TMJ), masturbation(hi http://reddit.com/r/nofap) and sex will be minimized and documented (looks like we will be getting to know each other Reddit) along with physical activity and stress. To keep lolabeans from clawing at the walls or my groin her oral sex level will be dramatically increased. I know this is a little TMI but people have and will ask.  After this is done pineapple components are next possibly followed by pH decrease, reduced alkalinity, and/or viscosity. Who knows maybe this will lead to a pill that makes semen taste like schnozberries.

I am now 21 and shortly before my 21st birthday I found myself in a relationship. At first this is a terrifying thing because you have a fear of people rejecting you once they hear A. You're not really a virgin, once you reach the point of having sex with them you will have trust and feel respected. I never thought I would be able to enjoy sex and it wouldn't feel good, seeing as my only encounter with it was a painful one. But I will just say it is fucking AWESOME. It can, and will happen for you. To whoever this applies, stop beating yourself up for not being ""normal"" because you're afraid of sex and the things surrounding it.

Let me preface this by saying this: my wife and I not only waited sexually

**We did it wrong.**

We courted for five years before tying the knot. Even then, but the desires 'to do it right' overrode the glaring flags in front of my eyes. 

Our wedding ceremony was a financial burden on us and our families, however, meant that by the time we got to our hotel for the night, we were both exhausted. What was supposed to be a beautiful night, turned into attempting to consumate our marriage just because that was what you did. 

Our honeymoon was interspersed with bitterness and fighting after it became apparent that my wife's sexual drive was near non-existent, the partner with a low libido holds all the power.

This evolved into a constant struggle over years: my pushing

After a couple years, only being able to visit on the weekends. The apparent strain eventually had me reconsider the distance, and I moved back; trading the distance for a daily hour long commute both ways. This was only marginally better. 

One night, I left a poem on her pillow, still feeling love in a painful situation. The morning brought me to panic with the poem still nestled on her pillow in that lonely bedroom. Panicking, I called hospitals, police departments, and anything else I could think of; after moments that felt like years, a friend of hers picked up, my wife called. I managed to find out that she had spent the night with a man from her work that had went out with them. 

I was shattered. Despite being broken

After 8 months and very little progress

Do your wedding the ""wrong way"". If you're young and wondering whether you should wait, let me tell you without a doubt that it isn't. Your wedding can be the a loving and beautiful ceremony you have with someone you know will last the long haul... or the pain you'll carry for the rest of your life.

I know this has probably evolved past the regular content of r/sex but I wanted to give you all one final update. I have received many encouraging messages from people that read my posts and reading your words of encouragement got me through a very rough time.

First of all (since this is the question I get the most)

I finally decided to contact her about two weeks after I initially stormed out. We decided to meet up at my hotel to talk. She came over and we talked for about four hours. I knew it was over before she even came over but I get the feeling she came over with the intention of convincing me to stay with her. She apologized dozens of times and told me the story of how her affair started. I don't exactly blame her for the initial infidelity. If I am being honest I was emotionally unavailable during some of that time because of high stress at work and the death of my father. But the length of her affair and the continual lying she had to do to keep it going have convinced me that I could never trust her again.

Our conversation that day ended very awkwardly. There was a lull about 4 hours in when I think both of us were exhausted from talking and shouting. She took that opportunity to try to make a move on me. I rebuffed her sexual advance and that made her start crying. It was really sad. She was balling but still offering to give me a BJ or ""whatever I wanted"". I think I can count on one hand the number of BJs I have gotten from her in the last year. This was not like her. This was sad

On a personal level

When we started out she was very sexual, then maybe once a week (to be expected). Now

I say anything, I've given her time, space, I've been gentle and never gotten annoyed with her at failed attempts (I mean this - I haven't just hidden it, I haven't been angry at all). I've told her to try whatever she can - although I've told her I'd prefer something better than a handjob because I can do that myself. It's becoming less and less frequent, as though she's not trying. We've tried lube, we've tried rules to make it easier (eg. both agreeing we won't try penetration even if we both want it). I've even suggested mutual masturbation would be enough to get comfortable with each other again. The only time I get angry is if she's trying something and obviously looks annoyed.  

She says she doesn't like sex, and she can't help it. She says everything leading up to it is the same; without arousal she doesn't want it. I asked her to try building up to the point where she remembers how much she used to enjoy it. I make sure she has an orgasm every time (even if she has to help out).  

We've only ever been with each other, and I believe her reasons.  

I am getting so annoyed with the situation, instead of being selfish, I should either accept it or leave. I love this girl completely, but I feel like I'm stuck and consigning myself to a life of frustration if I stay. She says she wants to marry me and have children (I've tried explaining how that wouldn't work) and I want the same except for this one thing. I just can't keep doing it. I've spoken to her about it a load of times. Sometimes I sleep in another room because I'm so frustrated lying next to her. I told her that seeing her undress really annoys me now because I want it but can't have it.  

It's so frustrating. I feel like I'd be leaving her over something trivial, cheat, or leave her, and I'll never cheat.

The texts have gone from fun and flirty.. to slightly explicit and naughty which I'll admit I liked. We finally had our first date I went to his place we had dinner and watched a movie. Hugging turned to cuddling turned to snuggling turned to me bent over the couch with his face deep between my cheeks with his tongue in me. I was totally into it and everything he was doing until he stopped for a second and was kissing my hips and he said "" there better not be any other guys competeting for you ... Cause i'll fuck those dudes up "" . I heard what he said but paid it no mind .. He literally was  tongue fucking me into a stupor so it didn't register like it probably should've .. It registered like oh he's being aggressive and macho and trying to be ""that"" guy.

Now once he made me orgasm 4x and when I was shaking and recovering .. He slid my panties back up ..pulled up my leggings straightened my shirt .. Then he pulled me up grabbed me rather firmly by the back of the neck and looked me in the eye and said "" you better stay talking to me or I'll fuck you up. Now give me a kiss little girl "" I kissed him because I didn't know what else to do.. I'll admit I was scared but in an arousing sort of way ..I sort of liked his laying claim to me. 

We cuddled for a small bit after I was a bit more closed off because him saying that started to play in my head .. What did he mean ? Did he just threaten me ? Was he being for real ...or was it just him trying to be sexy?  Minutes later he pulls me into his lap and we kiss and he's telling me how beautiful he finds me .. I ask him if he wants me .. He says yes I tease and say how bad tell me you want me .. He then quickly grabbed me by the throat flips me back and slams me into the couch holding my throat and says through his teeth .. ""You fucking ask me that one more time .. Of course I'm going crazy I want you so fucking bad ""  and that actually scared me.


Wtf does this mean ? Should I be alarmed ? And if so how do I ease out of it without poking the bear and him reacting in a way that hurts me. I sorta feel like it was meant to be sexy and aggressive and I love that in a man .. Someone who can toss me around a bit .. But something about it ...

A lot of your concerns were if her condition would allow her to have safe sex. I spoke with her about it

Next is the comfort level. She was a bit nervous at first, we started out with kissing, neck biting, and getting all touchy. I could tell she was still a bit nervous, so I made sure that I was being vocal so she knew I was enjoying it. After about 5 minutes, she told me she was too horny for all this foreplay jazz and told me to fuck her. Instant turn on for me.

As far as positions go, after we had cleaned up and gotten dressed, she was still curious if she could ever be on top. She can hold her balance fairly well, so I helped her bend her legs and she straddled me, and she leaned forward with her hands on my shoulders to support her. I would obviously have to do most of the work, but still very doable.

* ""Partner"" because these should work on a man or a woman
* I'm an average looking straight guy with a skinnyfat body. It turns out I'm  good at making a girl feel good

THE SEX TIPS THERE ARE THE BIGGEST LOAD OF BULLSHIT I HAVE EVER READ. YOU HAVE BETTER CHANCES WITH A GOOD SEX LIFE BY USING CRAIGSLIST.
* I might elaborate on things if you want me to but remember I'm no sexpert or doctor or jock. No personal question please. I'm just average and normal
* This post is divided into two parts

MENTAL/ENVIRONMENTAL:

You're a guy. You have a penis. When the penis is rubbed for a sufficient amount of time you will eventually orgasm. It's quite simple. You don't even give a fuck about who's rubbing it. 
She's a girl. For her, when you are having sex, you're not dealing with yourself. You're dealing with a different person and their pleasure may not always come through the ways it comes in for you.

1. UNDERSTAND HER. The key to good sex is to pay attention. I'll actually explain this so no freak out. If she arches her body, she likes it. If she's purring, she likes it. Trust me, these hints aren't subtle. If you're doing it right, they're obvious. Why don't you see them all the time though? Allow me to explain. BACKGROUND NOISE. You are so much into being rough and getting into her pants that you miss the hints. Slow down, tiger. Listen. Feel. Want to test my theory? Kiss her around the neck, lightly at first, finally bite a little. With any luck

2) EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT. You need to feel your way around to understand the mechanics of every girl. It's not a chore, even in a short time you can understand enough. And trust me it feels GOOD! 

3) THE PLEASURE IS SOMETIMES IN THE CHASE: We all like rough, right? Try doing the opposite though. Tease her from the beginning of the day. Act like you'll do her even before getting out of bed then stop. Touch and text her provocatively. Mix the two. Slide a finger around her waist when you see it. Kiss her neck when you're behind her. Then act nonchalant. When you're finally alone, act like you'd do anything to do her, but restrain yourself. Just till the edge. Lean close and pull out of a kiss. Now suddenly rub her vagina hard (don't hurt her!) and act like nothing happened. Back to the game. Enjoy it. Keep it on till she can take no more. Then give her the sweet, sweet release. Trust me she'll come before you get your pants off. Achievement Unlocked.

4) BE CLEAN: I cannot stress this enough. You need to smell nice and fresh. Good hygiene is VERY important. Always wear clean underwear. Just a little cologne or aftershave. Have a REALLY clean pubic region if you want a blowjob. Shaved balls mean they get some love too. A little natural scent is a turn on but don't stink!

5) ENVIRONMENT: Try lighting candles sometime. Incense if you like. Dim the lighting. Do it in the evening instead of the night. Do it in an open balcony (inb4 google earth). Have a huge bed. Or a couch. Or the kitchen floor. Mix and match. Don't make the setting always predictable. Now I'm not saying you can never have sex in the same place twice but make it special sometimes. USE MUSIC! Massive Attack and Burial and Bonobo and Sigur Ros and whatever you want!

PHYSICAL:

Aah. Now for the more actionable tips. Read on.

1) EVERYTHING IS KISSABLE: The asshole and the armpits will often be a girl's guilty pleasure that you should be careful with but try sometime. The ears are always good, then kiss it. Kiss under and between the breasts. Kiss the belly, the pubic mount. The thighs, the knees, the back of the knees (LOL Scott Pilgrim ) the feet, the toes, suck them a little if she likes. EVERY DAMN PART NEEDS A KISS UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE. Show her body some love. Not only is this a turn on, she's wet for you like crazy. See tip 3) above ;)

2) THE ASSHOLE CAN BE VERY SENSITIVE: While all girls are comfortable with you playing with the butt, tell her to be quiet and carry on (only if it is clean!) Breathe on it gently first. If she acts favorably, kiss and later, tongue. Remember, although you need to try new things, you also need to respect her limits. If you cannot do that, get a blow up doll.

3) BE CREATIVE WITH KISSING: Why would you not do that! Few things are as arousing as a man's lips on hers. Suck the lower lip. Then the upper one. Kiss all over the face but not the lips. Pull away, you're on hers, both of you are standing, all that. Kiss her in public sometime. Just a light peck. Bite her lips sometimes. Kiss the nose and the eyes. Kiss the goddamn jawline, it's magic. Kiss the spot below her ear. Kiss the ear. Lose yourself in her scent. Enjoy it, man. You're not a slave. This should make you feel good too. Trust me, a woman is an acquired taste :)

4) FUCKING LEARN HOW TO MASSAGE HER. And don't pay for it. Use Youtube. Not porn sites. Youtube. Massage her all over. I'm a massage God and I never ever saw even a video or got a massage. I'm just too good at reading a girl. A massage is not only wonderfully erotic, hold her tight and kiss her to a beautiful, dreamy sleep. Morning sex will ensue.

5) DOMINATE SOMETIMES. Hold her hands behind her. Bend her backwards when kissing. Pull her hair near the roots. Bite the neck. Use your body weight when on top sometimes. Push her against a wall and kiss her all over

6) [LEARN TO EAT HER OUT]( http://www.xvideos.com/video51477/nina_hartley_giving_pussy-eating_lessons_to_sunny_lane) In addition to this, hold a steady rhythm. Also finger her when giving oral sex. Also lots of saliva (You don't need to spit, porn is bullshit.) Also yes, I got this video off reddit and was surprised to find this is exactly what I do! And try 69. Works great although it's tough to get off because the other partner will lose their rhythm when close.

7) LEARN TO FUCK HER. You don't need to try the Kama Sutra to begin with (which by the way is a weird book that says letting insects bite your dick makes it bigger and only eunuchs suck cock). First, Doggy style. Now there are tricks to each: 

Missionary : Prop yourself up on the balls of your feet with legs extended. Go high. then go deep and slow. Slooooow. Like a machine powering down. Repeat. Ask her to fold her legs upwards, [read this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coital_alignment_technique)

Cowgirl: Prop yourself up on your elbows and push into her when she's bucking wildly. Align your movements with hers. Very pleasurable. Don't just lie down there! You can make it so much better. Let her hang her breasts into your mouth too. And play with the butt.

Doggy : ARCHING IS THE KEY! [So is making her legs not parallel, lick her pussy and ass. Play with the breasts a lot! And try going slower and slower like a machine powering down. KILLS!

8) DO MORE! Rub your dick all over her. Ask her to sit on your face. Lie naked till one of you NEEDS to fuck. Fuck the breasts. Lie on top and get a blowjob. Be creative. Just because the porn you saw had half an hour of sex and a money shot doesn't mean your sex life should be like this too.




CONCLUSION: Hopefully you read thus far. Now for the secret: THERE IS NONE. Just read her, no secret pleasure points. Nothing. Don't read stupid big-corp websites and magazines and goddamn Oprah. This is not their game, it's yours. It's yours to enjoy, not to win. At the end of it all when a sweaty, spent girl will give you the biggest smile ever and kiss you, you'll know you've been good. Sex is beautiful, as are you. Feel it.

Phew. That was some typing. Hope it's put to good use. Have fun
Also guys

Love!

To summarize:

virgin =/= stage 5 clinger once penetrated. 
This is as offensive as saying someone who has had a high number of sexual partners probably has STD's or has Daddy issues. It may be true for some


virgin =/= a child incapable of their own decisions. Seems to me a lot of non-virgins with virgins feel ""responsible"" for virgins. Virgins are adults who are capable of making their own decisions and dealing with the consequences


virgin =/= sexually oblivious. 
Just…trust me on this. Just because you haven't had PIV doesn't mean you aren't experienced in other sexual activities


virgin =/= emotionally oblivious.
Did you ever think that maybe some people wait because they are VERY aware of the intricacies of relationships (both sexual and non sexual) and are carefully weighing pros and cons and working on developing their relationship skills before fully committing to someone else? 


(male) virgin =/= desperate.
I am sure there are plenty of male virgins who have had reasons or beliefs for waiting

So I was a 25 year old virgin till yesterday. I met a girl on a party this friday. We kissed and she always told me what she want to do to me in bed. We had no place to go on this evening so we decided to meet on saturday. It was 100% sure we gonna have sex. She didn`t know I was vigrin because I lied about some sex stories. I was nervous because I thought that I would blow my load as soon as she touches me. That´s where you guys came into the story. I browsed /r/sex for about two ours to be prepared.

Back to her house. We started immediately as I entered. She blew me for about 10 minutes and I was surprised I could take it without cumming. After that I went down on her for my first time and because of [this](http://www.xvideos.com/video51477/nina_hartley_giving_pussy-eating_lessons_to_sunny_lane) she came after 10-15 minutes. Then we started fucking. To my surprise i managed three different positions till we came together. We spend like 5 hours in bed with some breaks and I gave her several orgasms. After I came the second time I wasn`t even able to finish so she asked to stop because she said it was too much.

All in all it was the best fucking night of my life and I just want to spread the message to other virgins that the internet is a wonderful place to learn everything and that you shouldn`t be concerded like me that you cum too fast or that you dissappoint the woman.

Credentials: I'm a slut in a poly marriage. I have racked up a count of lovers in my 36 years on this earth that makes many people blanch and step away from me. 21 years sexually active, I have been married, I've been single, and I've done it all, baby.

- If she's dry, depending on country and poll. It's common. If she says she's into it, trust her at her word, put a splot of lube on, and go to town. You'll both be happy you did.
- If you're both virgins, or him getting off too quick, pain, blood, cramps, shame, etc. All of that is normal. In the end, and you communicate with your lover honestly. 
- He's going soft
- Provided that it harms nobody unwillingly, it's all good.
- Communicate with your partner.
- Do Kegels.
- Just fucking talk to them
- Use condoms. When in any form of doubt
- Most women, you're fine. 
- Women who squirt are sexy. It is not disgusting to us menfolk. We love it. We want to roll around on it like a dog in the garbage. 
- Get tested
- No
- Getting into a three-way is always a touch-and-go situation
- Friends with benefits situations are perfectly normal
- If your lover professes that they think you're hot
- They're called the G-Spot and the Anterior Fornix Zone. Google that shit and read up on them. 
- Everyone cums differently. Everyone. 

I hope this post can be pointed to in the future as a sort of FAQ for sexxit. Bring on the downvotes and anger.

This starts in a stupid
  
Okay. So he pushes in and it is the first time anyone’s *ever* been in there. Like **ever**. And two things happen within three seconds: I get idiotically
  
My doctor laughed his ass off. I mean *laughed*
  
But his face tells me it’s not that common.  
  
Dutifully, “let’s buy a fucking drumstick and do this thing.”  
  
So I go to a music store and buy a pair of drumsticks, as if the guy behind the counter could see *into my soul*, perfectly aware that I was going to shove one of those sticks right up my ass when I got home.  
  
I knew. He knew. The guy driving the bus knew. The drumsticks sat in that bag like the fucking One Ring, and I was going to fuck myself with them.  
  
So I get home and I do all the stuff. Lube, feel, POW.  
  
Shit like cum
  
(Another question. Purple tip. Normal when super-hard? Or am I going to give myself a blood clot or something? This is new for me.)  
  
It keeps coming, too. That’s new. All my muscles tense up under my skin. They’re probably fucking blushing by now, too. I’m a big, red, purple dicked, autoerotic machine, pounding this drumstick into my ass while my GF is at work
  
My balls get this frozen cold sensation
  
At which point I actually, see goddamn stars. Little colored lights. My head rushes. I cum so hard I actually scream. Not like a girl, I scream like an extra in 300. I scream like someone lifting a Buick over their head.  
  
Long story short it was the best orgasm of my life. And later that night, she’s awesome, but it didn’t compare. 
  
Next day
  
More sex with GF. She knows something’s up. Maybe not “I FOUND OUT MY BF IS FUCKING HIMSELF WITH SURPLUS MUSICAL EQUIPMENT REDDIT WHAT DO I DO?” up
  
I keep the drumsticks on the nightstand like the fucking purloined letter. I say they’re for her. But I can kind of tell she’s not buying it. She knows I’m not as enthusiastic about sex.  
  
Fast forward three months. By now I’ve graduated to a full-on cock-shaped dildo stuck to the bedroom wall. Ass up, I don’t get this either. Why cock shaped? Because I wanted something thicker and I figured if I was going to be fucking myself on a daily basis, I might as well get over any lingering homophobia that might be clinging to my soul.  
  
Okay, it would be super convenient if I were Gay, because then I could tell my GF that I’m gay, and get fucked on a regular basis. I don’t know what to do about this. GF tries to seduce me a few times a week and I go along with it. She cums... and so do I, but it’s not fun for me. I lost interest in her. It takes me forever to cum.  
  
No, my GF wouldn’t peg me if I asked her about it. I brought it up, hypothetically, in terms of “something I found on Reddit.” Her reaction was not promising. I’m not going to say she’s homophobic or anything, but she has very traditional views of what men and women are supposed to be like, and writhing like a demon  while a huge cock slides up into your hole is *not* what the man is supposed to do - so she says, anyway.  
  
And the problem is also that I just don’t want to fuck her anymore. I want to *be* fucked. And even though I’m not attracted to men, no cheat-o) and hooking up with guys. But even that isn’t something I want to do, because I love her (we’ve been together for almost a year) and I love being with her. Just not “BEING WITH” her.

Just a heads up

So

I cried a bunch (predictably). I said a lot of the same stuff I had been saying in the other thread -- how I had been having fantasies of women and struggled feeling sexually attracted to him. I thought he was going to be super hurt

I thought confessing my lack of satisfaction with our sex life would hurt his pride or ego or whatever

I felt pretty sheepish after that. There was a lot of apologizing and watery laughing after that. I felt this huge burden lift after crying it out. We chatted about other stuff in our lives

I felt nervous and wrong-footed. It's been a long time since I've been so vulnerable and open

He said that he 'wanted to try something'. I was SUPER self-concious

But he talked me through it. I didn't have any expectations really...after putting everything out there in the open

So I'm lying there, okay?) and he starts talking about my body. He's petting me and rubbing me and it felt nice, in a calming sort of way.

But then *OH MY SWEET FUCKING GOD* did he surprise me! He started out saying innocent enough things

But then like all of a sudden he starts saying totally raunchy, stuff that would make your hair curl. And like....he put an extra focus on all of the feminine parts of me, talking about how hot girls are.

I started picturing it along with what he was saying

We started talking back and forth. He asked questions about girls that I'd pictured or fantasized about. We compared what we liked. It was straight up

Okay. So

Honestly it was all the dirty talk that helped me through it. And hell

1358291550.0,16nc8j,Still doing the alphabet thing ? Here's how you should deal with going down on a girl,ljog42,2129,826,272,"I originally posted this as a comment, so here it is 

First 
1 - The most basic is of course, that's what we all instinctively do.

2 - Circles. This move is very useful for a particular reason : I noticed that going straight to the clit can be kinda painfull at first for the girl, it does not feel particulary awesome, but it get's you hard and waiting for the real deal.

3 - Suck. Yes, and such things... but this move is important because it allows you to rest your tongue, it gives you this 1 or 2 seconds break you need, plus she'll want you to start licking again, while still feeling stuff.

So you tried those three moves while reading this and it's pretty simple
Don't go straight to the mofuckin' clit. Never. Have you ever had an inexperienced girl go ham on your cock like she's Sasha Grey ? That doesn't feel very good, it takes all the fun out of getting a blowjob. Well, for girls, it's even more important to really build things up, because it's not really about how much they are stimulated, it's about how much they are aroused. So what you need to do, is take your time to get where she knows you're going. Caress her legs, her pussy without opening it up and sticking a finger in it, she's expecting your tongue in her pussy at any moment but doesn't really know when

Then you finally stick your tongue in. I'm not going to explain how to find the clit or whatever I'm going to assume you've had a little sex ed in your life and will be able to find your way. Make sure the lips are spread apart, and the best way to do that is to make sure she experiences a wide range of pleasurable feelings, and a little frustration too. So you gently but firmly explore her pussy with your tongue, the inner lips are not very sensitive, nor is the entry to the vagina, but still make her feel your tongue there and there, mess around. Then, but don't rush things up

So this was the two parts of the warm up. She should start to enjoy herself, and want you to really get started, or if she wants you to keep this pace for a little more time. Well, my friend, you have to guess this by how she reacts. Let's say she's ready for you to really give her pleasure. Now you can lick the clit up and down, but not too fast ! Lick the whole area between her vag and the top of her clit, so each stroke starts and end on a part not too sensitive but always stimulate her clit. Accelerate your pace, which is under some kind of ""hood"" with a left and right movement, even maybe seconds before she comes, suck on it strongly when your tongue starts to hurt... when she starts to cum

Now there is a few things that are absolutely essential that I have to add. First, see how she reacts to what you do and adapt. TALK TO HER. There's nothing shameful about asking what was good and what was bad, communication is the key to all relationships. Secondly, but it should have been first, be sensual. Listen to the girl's body, try to feel it, take pleasure from what you're doing, even if going down on a girl is not particularly something you like. In one word : be fuckin passionate about it ! This means use your damn hands. Keep caressing her, look her in the eyes. It should not be just a tongue on her clit, between her legs

How to get bonus points : put some Marvin Gaye on, let her rest a little while cuddling her when it's over even if you're going to bang right after that

TL;DR : Read the whole damned thing for fucks sake

Sources : Nina Hartley, My ex, Me.


EDIT : This post is going to be a collaborative post I think. I re-read it and there's two things I had to precise :

First : when I'm talking about the final rush, so going faster and stronger shouldn't mean going really crazy, the line between ""hm, harder, this feels so good"" and ""huh, it hurts"" is easy to cross. 

Secondly : some people here wrote that they had some even better results when the slowed down at the very end. I think it's really interesting


EDIT 2 : As some girls said, or not so much. Again, get to know the girl so you know what she really likes. Here is, according to carolinared, how you should proceed : 

&gt;two fingers going slightly in and straight up in a come hither motion while the clit is getting some work done is fucking amazing.

Warning : I've heard that it might cause female ejaculation

EDIT 3 : Ok
Here's a secret move I used to do but that I somehow forgot to mention and that a kind redditor reminded me of, you can flick it with your tongue at the SAME DAMN TIME. As you can imagine, it works like a charm. Don't be too rough tho.

I must add another warning of top of that, where there is a hood that protects it. A few millimeter up, you can feel the ""root"" of the clit, as I call it, which is a great place to be stimulated with a left to right movement according to my experience.

EDIT 4 : Ok, seriously pal that's awesome now I'm gonna be branded as a karma whore for the rest of my life on reddit but fuck it ! Feels good ! #1 of the Sex page ? More than 700 upvotes ? Common guys I barely had 700 karma points yesterday !!

Secondly
I made this because I realized some guys would probably bore they GF to death if they tried to perform oral on her, some of the techniques shown here may be completely ineffective or even weird to some girls. I think I have to stress even more that EVERY GIRL is different, and that even if I praised a technique in this post, you should make sure it does work, and stop rightaway if it doesn't. Listen. To. Your. Partners. Body. 

What is the most important in this post, but how you should work on your timing, your pace, how you should make your partner feel, because what saddens me with a lot of men, is not that they do not have the right moves, but that they simply consider oral as basic ""let's get her wet"" foreplay and don't do it seriously. Do not be that guy that just puts his dick in her, be dedicated,self,

After 7 years of trying to deal with vulvodynia, through a system that often forgets about chronic patients, I went to my local STI clinic for a general screening, only to have the nurse drop everything and find me a vulval specialist who saw me within the hour. I had never had such great care and service in my whole life.

She was really kind and she did everything right when it came to the physical examination. And then she did what none of my previous doctors have ever done for me. She gave me something for the pain. Previously I had always been fobbed off with ""Just take some advil before sex"" as though that was my biggest issue (I had to give up bike riding, most days I find it hard to walk)

This specialist was shocked that my doctors had ignored my pain, Nor has any pharmacist recommended it when I came in to buy 700 billion tablets of Advil for my crotch. I never knew it existed.

She then said she would like to make another appointment with me (Yes! Ongoing treatment, and apologized for it being so far away. I'm just so overwhelmed with how brilliant this service was, and also really annoying that this place was right under my nose this whole time and I had just spent 7 years in pain when there were so many people willing to help me that I just hadn't met.


The new pain killers are working well. I had sex with my husband for the first time in 3 years, No afterburn! This is what a healthy person must feel from and after sex, No wonder people do it just for fun. I have never felt such pleasure, such connection and just such relaxation. I'm just so happy that there is finally a light at the end of my tunnel.

To top it all off this treatment, and public health covers any returning visits.

I'm a 36 year old mostly straight male who has never been described as an Adonis. I've always been a little on the chubby side, and of being a kinky son of a bitch, I figured maybe I can assuage some of your concern by sharing some of the things I've learned along the way. Yes, this advice won't work for everyone. Yes, this advice won't work ON everyone. However, I assure you, if you take it to heart, and it will probably go a long way to getting you to chill out about your cock size.

(Oh

1 - **Learn to talk.**

Seduction always begins with conversation. You MUST first engage a woman's mind if you want to engage with her body. Find out who she is, what she likes, what her fantasies are. Tell her what yours are. (Pro-tip: If early in the conversation, she mentions how she loves huge horse cocks, this is probably not the right partner for you. Move on). As you move into an erotic comfort zone with her (meaning that there's clear sexual tension between you), tell her what you'd like to do. Be detailed. When, where, the setting. Describe how you think it would feel. Describe how much you want it

2 - **Educate yourself on her anatomy.**

For god's sake, understand that women are COVERED in erogenous zones...it's not all about the pussy. Your hot breath on her shoulder as you move in from behind to nibble the place where it connects with her neck can have far more turn-on effect than your clumsy fumbling around in her panties. Learn the specific variances of HER anatomy...some women like their nipples bitten and sucked, while to some, anything other than the most delicate of touching on their breasts is painful. Even in a single woman, there can be variances depending on the time of the month. Which leads me to...

3 - **Pay the fuck attention.**

Human sexual response is physiological. It's observable. There are visible keymarkers that will tell you if you're doing it right. PAY ATTENTION. Is her breathing getting deeper, or did she pull back? Are her cheeks flushed? Did her nipples perk up? Read her body language, and adjust what you are doing accordingly. Err on the side of softness with each new thing that you do, and build up to more pressure/intensity based on her body's responsiveness to your actions.

4 - **SLOW DOWN**

Yes, that's all a woman wants. However, I hear far more often that there is a rush to insertion. This is a HUGE mistake, especially if you're worried about your penis size. You know how blood engorges your penis, making it hard? Blood also engorges the vagina and vulva, *making it smaller and tighter*. This is directly to your benefit. If you've brought her to climax before you ever slide inside her, you're going to find that she's tighter and hotter than if you just go straight for the main course. Take the time to explore her body, and engaging them. Kiss her all over. Touch her, letting the warmth of your hand transfer to her. Lick, complete with your own sounds of enjoyment. If you're fully engaging her

5 - **Fuck like you have a big dick

When you enter her, and then back in a little deeper. Repeat that process until you finally feel it slide completely home. Don't get lost in your own sensation, no matter how good...think of your cock as a finger with which you are touching her inside. Don't just jackhammer away, hold her tightly, and deliberately thrust inside her. Bury yourself to the hilt, and hold it there for a second, pressing into her as hard as you can. If you're in a missionary position, with your pubis pressing into hers. Shift your hips as needed, remember all the previous tips...talk to her

If you saw me on the street, attentive lover, who's never afraid to explore new things and test my (and her) limits. Your lack of confidence will utterly fade away if you're having good sex every time, and your new self confidence will only lead to better sex, and more opportunities. ",,False,t5_2qh3p,True

My side faces the next door duplex which is inhabited by an extremely attractive, 40yo woman (she has a bf that does not live with her) and her 16 yo teenage daughter which possesses all the womanly characteristics of an extremely attractive 20-something including very adult hips and what only can be described as large, perky breasts. 
Indeed I thought she WAS a college student living with mom until they both told me she had just turned 16 and was going to be a junior in her high school.  

If you know who porn star Lexi Belle is, I'm going to call her Lexi.

Lexi flirts and teases excessively. Shortly after I moved in, I just said thank you politely and said I had to finish washing up the car because I had an appointment. (Which I didn't have, I went to the store).

Also a couple weeks ago on a Saturday I went to collect my mail. Lexi was lying on her lawn getting a tan in a little bikini. She sees me and comes up to say ""Hi"" and says ""Look my mom let me get a tongue ring"" and proceeds to stick out the tongue to show me. I'm lucky I didn't get a boner right there. I said like ""Nice. did it hurt?"" and she was like ""only a little
At this point I'm like thinking ""is this for real? it's like a penthouse porno."" I swear this girl was put on Earth by Satan to tempt me. And I'm an atheist!

I was just like ""Well..Say hi to your mom!"" Awkward! Went inside

The other problem is my bedroom faces Lexi's. She has a tendency to leave her blinds open. I've seen glimpses of naked or semi-undressed before and immediately left my room so I don't feel like a dirty pervert. I've started to keep my blinds closed in there all the time. Thank god my computer room is in the other bedroom

Fast forward to this Saturday. Lexi's mom tells me to keep an eye on Lexi if I can, it doesn't bother me, whatever.
Saturday night comes around

Fast forward to about 1 in the morning. I've gone to bed and gone to sleep. I sleep with the window open, always have been, and I awake to the sounds of porno. Or what sounds like porno. Curious of course, and not thinking, since I was asleep. I go the window and peer through the blinds.

Lexi's window is open. Her blinds are down

I immediately know I need to close the blinds and go away.

I also immediately have a hard-on. (A guilty hard-on. Who wouldn't in this situation)

I close the blinds. I decide to go to my computer room, I'm exhausted. Head back to bed. It is now quiet. I cannot resist a peek. Her room is still lit up blue from the lava lamp, and it looks like she's asleep on her bed. Guy might be gone, I don't know.

I go to sleep, I KNOW, that she will pop into my head. I cannot get the image of her having sex out of my mind.

I think I have to move. I'm a grown adult. Admittedly I haven't had sex in a long time, and I think any guy in my position would be equally frustrated. Just to be clear *I would never do anything with this girl*.

TL;DR Hot jailbait daughter flirts with me excessively - now I see her fucking. Can't stop thinking about it. Feel guilty. What do?

A small group of people keeps bringing up the unholy trifecta: children, people: everything we talk about in sex positivity is guided by the concepts of SAFE, SANE, and CONSENSUAL. If you have a pathology which leads to criminal sexual desires, my advice isn't for you, and I'm not qualified to answer your questions. You'll need to seek professional help with someone experienced with those pathologies.

Men and penis size: From my experience, and if you feel that the size of your penis is affecting your performance, that's your first problem right there: blaming the penis. Being able to get someone riled up, in the mood and into YOU is going to get her there a lot faster than a large penis. I've been with my fair share of well-endowed men, and from my experiece it didn't seem to make them especially cocky unless they had actual underlying bedroom skills to back it up, otherwise it was akin to a viking flailing around a large sword. Remember, gear doesn't count for much if you don't know how to make it work for you. Sex is extremely psychological for women; that doesn't mean that we need flowers and froofy romantic gestures to get into the mood, which is hard to do when you're hung up on the size of your manhood. The kind of confidence that makes me shiver with anticipation and have a really wicked connection with someone does not come from having a large penis

If you found this at all helpful

**EDIT**
I'm also adding my answer to one commentor's question: Large penises are a trophy society has created; like karma, it only exists in the mind. Even if a guy doesn't care about boob size, he's gonna feel pretty baller with Ms. DD's on his arm if he feels that large boobs are something that is considered desirable at large. I am someone that finds bed skills valuable, not penis size or looks. So I don't brag about how hot I am, but I will gloat like a warlord over my technique in the sack, because I find that skill worth bragging about.

**FINAL EDIT**
I am shuttin' down this comment spree on my end, every girl on here agrees with me wholeheartedly and if that's not enough to change your mind, then I certainly can't. You're going to get girls who say a big penis is what matters, and girls will get guys who say that a huge rack matters, and my gift to you is this: 
Don't sleep with them.

 Soo many people don't know

 I have gotten free condoms, anywhere from 15 to 50. No questions asked, no names asked, no payment asked for and no forms to fill out, and no waiting ( sometimes they need to walk down the hall and get them from a store room)

Std testing, and been charged as much as 15 dollars. This is most often a sliding scale based off your income. If you have no income it is FREE.  ( note here, when I was broke I got tested at the county health department, when I was working I went to my regular gyno that my insurance paid for)

They also offer birth control services. Some will hand you pill packs just like planned parenthood



Depending on state laws

This is a link to ONE county health department in the US. I picked this one as being the first one on google search that shows a range of services that I have found typical in the many states I have lived in. http://www.dadehealth.org/women/WOMENfamily.asp



Please, cost of condoms, tell them about this all important resource. Nearly every populated county in the US has a County Health Department. 

Edit 1 : yes Planned Parenthood offers all this too. But they are not in as many places and might be harder to get to for a lot of people. I know the closest one to me is about a two hour drive. Find your nearest Planned parenthood http://m.plannedparenthood.org/mt/www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/?un_jtt_redirect

Still looking for a ' nearest county health department link' ( I'm on mobile so its a bit slow)

Edit 2 : A user is having a hard time getting latex free condoms. Does anyone know a resource for them? I don't know if County health has them at all or if planned parenthood has them. ( I feel like they should but never needed to ask for them)

Can we help this user out? 

Edit; planned parenthood has latex free. A call to my local county health department confirms they have them too.





Last edit for now. I am still looking for free non latex condom resources.  I am sure there is something out there and will keep looking.  If a mod wants to add this post to the sidebar

So as im going in her with a force of a hundred men i slip out one last time and BAM something felt like it snapped in my penis and i stopped in my tracks ( I basically slammed my penis into her bone around her vagina) shot straight up looked down and freaking blood all over my gf vagina and upper thigh and i thought maybe it was her or something.  Nope i SAW blood gushing out of my penis in spurts like wtf holy shit.  What erection i did have now in its place was a flaccid penis and a huge ass swollen bulge beside my penis!  That bulge was bigger then my penis. So i hold it and the blood stops and i run to the washroom and point it in the toilet and blood is just gushing out all over the place in spurts.  (throughout this whole ordeal i didn't feel any pain so maybe i was in a bit of a shock or adrenaline rush) tell my gf to grab the keys were heading to emergency and i basically just wrapped my penis in so much toilet paper so it wouldnt seep through the pants. 

so head to the hospital at 3 am and basically jump the line and the staff ask me if its an emergency and i was like umm we were having sex and now bloods coming out of my penis.  the guys the staff were serving were like damnn what did you do to him to my gf lol.  i thought that was funny. so they take me in and give me somehting for the pain and we wait till 1030am for the urologist. 
he checks me out and gives me a ct scan and an xray with a dye test.
at 1 pm we do the surgery and it came out that i rupture the erection vessel that holds the blood for the erection he called it a canon.  and i had a ripped in my urethra.  

now here i am with a catheter in my penis and basically dont control my pee. it goes directly to a portable bag attached to my leg.

I bought these bastards last night and used them last night with some slight discomfort. I removed the condom to find that my penis was all red and irritated. I was concerned, there were a fair amount of users who'd reported pain and irritation after using these condoms. 
  
The most frequent symptom they reported was excruciatingly painful urination. 
  
So I drank some water and stayed up for a bit to wait to go to the bathroom and see how bad it would be. I did
  
That was until this morning. I got up to go to the bathroom and almost fell to the floor in pain. It was like trying to piss hot needles. I could only pass a few drops before the total agony shuddered my bladder closed
  
The box does disclose that some users might be sensitive to the  spermicide, I can certainly sense this pain, it's not like a faint, general irritation. It's like getting stabbed in the dick. The CDC doesn't even recommend this shit. Why would they cover a condom with it?   
   
FOR FUCKS SAKE

Now my bladder is full and I can't fight it any longer. I am off to try and piss without crying. Wish me luck.  

EDIT: not a latex allergy. I've used hundreds of latex condoms with no ill-effects.   
  
GOOD NEWS EDIT: My pain has decreased substantially since this morning. I've just been drinking a ton of water and every trip to the bathroom gets a little easier. Hopefully I'll be right as rain by sometime tomorrow. 
  
EDIT 3:  I wanted to take this opportunity before this left the front page to clear some things up.   
  
First of all, and hopefully prevent the repetition of my reaction in others. Consider trying non-genital testing before using a new product. 
 
Secondly, READ THE BOX and make sure that you know exactly what you're buying. It sounds pretty obvious, but when you're in a hurry...  just read the box.  
     
I'd like to thank everyone for sharing their experiences and support with me. Some of you guys even made me laugh... quite the feat. It really helped me feel better. This is an amazing community,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1341380798.0,,,t3_vzfr5
1355076682.0,14k0s5,Hey Sexxit! I absolutely love giving advice and this seems to be a common question in this subreddit so I'd like to share with you: How I give mindblowing head,KitsBeach,1775,618,286,"Hello my beloved Sexxit! I hope there's at least one new thing you've never done in here so you can have a wonderful and sexy Sunday! Just browse the bolded titles for whatever strikes your fancy.

-------------------------------------

**The Basics**  

* Switch up the sensations every 60 seconds
* Run circles around the corona
* Lick your lips, slide past it a little bit, then come up and completely off his penis. Better if you can make a little *pop* sound as you come up.  
* Take him in as deep as you can. Move your tongue: stick it out your mouth so it runs the length of him. Wag it back and forth. Draw squiggles up and down. Make swallowing movements
* Swirl his head: think of the tip of his penis as a clock face. Lay the bottom side of your tongue at ""12 oclock"" swing down to ""6 oclock""

Important: your blowjob main position should be such that your lips are guarding around your teeth to avoid your teeth grazing his penis. Most guys don't like teeth. That being said, I liked it when your teeth tickled my dick a little"" then forget this point and go back to what he likes.

-------------------------------------

**Get wet**  
This one's simple. Just use lots of saliva. Stop wiping it away with the bed sheets. Stop swallowing all your excess drool. I'm not saying spit on it like in porn (although he might like that)

-------------------------------------

**Ballsack: Basic**  
Lick it. Swirl an infinity sign around each ball (to this day, alternating between lick types. So if you use the tip of your tongue on a downstroke, use the flat of your tongue on an upstroke. Use your thumb and pointer finger to massage both balls as you give head.

**Ballsack: Intermediate**
Proceed with caution: Wet those lips, very gently draw it into your mouth. 

**Ballsack: Advanced -- (Analingus
You're gonna want to check if he's okay with this one, transition to his butt next. You can take this as far as both of you are willing, but since this is mainly a blowjob guide I'm going to keep it basic. Use the point of your tongue to draw circles around his butthole, flick it, do wide and long licks.

-------------------------------------

**Hair**  
If you aren't sure whether he will be into ass play at all, so you're 69ing. Take a strand of hair and tickle his perineum or butthole. It's extra stimulation, kinda like how if he plays with your nipples alone it might not do much, but if he touches them during sex it's amazing!

-------------------------------------

**Icy Air**  
When you've got his head nicely wetted up, right?

-------------------------------------

**Deepthroating: Basic**  
This is kinda big-league stuff, but you can reach a point where that won't happen anymore. The two easiest positions to do it (read: least likely to trigger the gag reflex) for me are 1. him lying on his back, me sitting on his face and bending over to his penis (since his bends up. If your man bends down, position yourself between his legs as he lies down. Or beside his hip if he bends to the side. Basically just imagine your mouth and throat and the shape they make, and arrange yourself so his penis is going to follow that curve) and 2. Me lying on my back, head on the edge of the bed, and him standing up. Note that number one allows for you to have more control, so if you are a beginner here number one is better to start.

Now, or a scratch, or a double tap, whatever. Obviously a hand signal is a better choice than a vocal cue! Play around and find which way feels most comfortable for it to slide in. For me, it's easier if his tip runs along the roof of my mouth, to the back of my throat, then around the bend. You can either get him deep and keep him deep, which will grip his penis and massage his tip with your epiglottis (which has been describes as ""that's just... whoa... 10/10""). Move your tongue around

**Deepthroating: Super advanced (Face fucking)**  
You should NOT do this until you feel you have begun to master the basics of deepthroating, so there is a certain mastery to this. Just get into position 2 described above and... let him go. You might want to indicate how hard and fast he can go by stroking his leg (start slow and gentle, pick it up as you feel comfortable).

-------------------------------------

**Have fun!**  
LAAAAAAAAME. But I'm not joking. That's how I discovered the Hair and Icy Air tricks. I was just playing around with his penis while sucking him off and had a stroke of genius. If you keep it fun

-------------------------------------

**Attitude**  
Yeah yeah yeah

*My man gets home from work. I instruct him to hit the shower then meet me in the bedroom, ""Yeah, I'm gunna sit on that"". I approach the bed with a little smile and settle into my position between his legs. My eyes haven't left his package since I laid eyes on it, and now I'm thinking of all the terrible, terrible things I'm going to do to it, and I can't help but smile in anticipation. As I'm licking him, I'm also kissing it and making little sounds of pleasure. Like a porn star, really getting into it. Saliva is dribbling out

Ok, notice how each thing I did there showed I was looking forward to and enjoying the blowjob. The instruction that he take a shower was a legitimate tip; it's a lot easier to be enthusiastic over a freshly showered penis than a I-just-worked-my-ass-off-all-day penis, amirite ladies? You can do as I do and just get down to business (Hey, I'm a straight to the point kinda gal, plus the guys I've been with digged how it seems like I can't wait to wrap my lips around them) or you can tease him for as long as you like. The ""little sounds of pleasure""... well, I don't know what else to call them, but they're the same sounds YOU make when he's eating you out. I normally DO NOT like to blend porn sex and real life sex since they're totally different, because lots of guys like how you look like that

Whether you love to give blow jobs or not

-------------------------------------

And that's about all I can think of for now. Happy sexing!

1304118234.0,h0hr9,I just watched my partner orgasm non-stop for 3.5 hours. It started in my apartment and ended in the emergency room. I swear I am not making this up.,eric_arrr,2145,992,489,"The point of this post is not to take any special credit for causing the epic orgasm, and utterly bizarre experience as best I'm able.

It all began innocently enough, we didn’t do anything especially freaky or unusual. We’re a little kinkier than your average, um, bears, but we weren’t getting up to anything we haven’t already done a zillion times without any remarkable consequences.

So, my alarm went off.  That was when I first made a note of the time: 8:15 am.  She’d been coming for nearly ten minutes.

 “Best orgasm of my life

Anyway, continue to moan and writhe in ecstasy no matter what you do to her, you take advantage.  The exact, lurid details of round three are left to the imagination of the reader.

As the 60 minute mark approached

Yes, moan, she was fully, moan, mobile.  No, she hadn’t taken any drugs.  (moan)  He tentatively suggested the emergency room.  She doesn’t have health insurance, so she opted to ride it out a bit longer.

She texted a friend of hers who is interning at Columbia.  The friend asked something about vaginal contractions

So I got dressed and went to the pharmacy.  When I got back, and I worried that the neighbors would consider us rude for the flagrant sexual marathon they no doubt imagined was occurring.  In reality, there had been only twenty or thirty minutes of actual boning.

So she took the Benadryl and we kicked off round four while we waited for it to take hold.  Half an hour later

“Get to the emergency room. Now.”

Okay

She couldn’t get dressed

As we drove to the hospital

“My legs are going numb,” she said.  (I thought, “Well, technically…” But I kept my mouth shut.)

At the hospital, disheveled woman in a bathrobe into the waiting area.  They rushed her through the double doors, while I stayed behind at the registration desk.

The waiting room was crowded with people who mistook us for about-to-be parents.  An elderly couple beamed at me.  Somebody else told me I’d remember today for the rest of my life.  “You got that right

Meanwhile, solid zero,” she said.

I also learned later that while I was in the waiting area, I’d be richer than Google.)

Not much later

The doctors were at a loss, as she didn’t take any last night, although she did go to sleep extremely drunk.)

We left the hospital just before noon

“Are you okay

“What

""Yes, I assure you, if you take it to heart, you'll find your sexual relationships to be far more fulfilling, and it will probably go a long way to getting you to chill out about your ~~cock size~~ breast or dress size.""

**1. Own your sexuality.**

I see so many posts on here asking what you can do for him, but I don't see anywhere near enough about *knowing yourself*. The very best sexual relationships involve both partners being equally fulfilled, but if you're unsure or uncommunicative about your wants and desires, we're going to be absolutely clueless (which is not going to get you off). Be introspective about your sexual identity, and engage with us in honest communication about what you want, need, like, but understand that we both want to know

**2. We need seduction too...it's just easier on us than on you.**

While many men seem to forget the importance of foreplay, it would be instant boner, sparks and fireworks, right? Hell no. I love my woman, and lust for her near constantly, but a hard day, parental duties, and all of the other things that affect you affect us as well. There are plenty of times that the spirit is willing

**3. You are ~~allowed to~~ ENCOURAGED TO ask for sex too.**

Hopefully we've come far enough by 2012 that women don't as a rule think they're expected to play coy and resistant. Yet a lot of women still seem to think that the guy should be initiating all sexual contact. We've seen some excellent threads here lately asking about how to initiate sex. Nothing works better than asking for it. Men tend to experience sexual appetites similar to physical appetites; when I'm in need, and my lover rests her breast on my back and whispers in my ear that she needs me inside her, we're going to be in the bedroom in about four and half seconds. 

**4. We jerk off. We suspect you do too. Can we just be OK with this?**

Nothing will kill a sexual relationship like one partner being shamed for sexual behavior. I've seen the subject of masturbation come up on here over and over again, so being hurt about our masturbating makes us feel ashamed for engaging in a personal behavior that's been with us for as long as we were capable of doing so. Worst case scenario, just accept that it's going to happen. Best case scenario, let's play together! There are tons of fun scenarios for separate and mutual masturbation in a relationship, and these are also good opportunities for us to learn what you like. 

**5. Nothing

OK, wondering what the hell you were thinking, and how ridiculous you feel. You know what we're thinking?

""OH MY GOD

We want to feel like powerful, and your sexual confidence is what takes us there. When you look us in the eye during sex, when you vocalize your desires, when you strut your stuff and shake your ass, when flash us in the middle of the afternoon with a twinkle in your eye, when you buy those special panties and tell us about them, all of those times when you're ""trying to be sexy"", tell us your fantasies

**Just because it's referred to as sucking doesn't mean you have to actually suck.**
At least not all the time. It brings teeth into contact (which a lot of guys dislike) and limits the use of your tongue. I rarely actually suck

On the teeth/suction thing

**Use your tongue.**
Now, quite frankly, that's generally where all the most sensitive areas are. Try to tickle and massage with your tongue. I usually concentrate on the webbing at the base of the head.

**Don't feel like you have to maintain eye contact *all* the time.**
Yes

**Listen
Listen when you're giving head. Be aware of grunts and moans that tell you what you're doing right. And during pillow-talk, ask for more feedback; etc. Treat it as a skill you're honing, because it is.

**Love his member.**
I am *this close* to creating a god damn shrine for my boyfriend's cock. He knows it. So when I'm down there doing my thing, smiling and giggling. And this matters. When you give head it should be a positive experience for the both of you. 

When you're down there, kiss it, caress it, and tease it. I can't exactly teach you this, but this is what a guy means when he asks for 'enthusiasm'.

1368546933.0,1ebjbr,Just struck a big item off my sexual bucket list... feeling pretty great and wanted to share some thoughts,pooperslooper,1875,754,285,"So recently I [F] pegged a guy for the first time. I recognize pegging's not for everyone

The best reason to try pegging, even if that's not quite the case, the penetration reversal can be a real eye-opener (as well as ass-opener, obviously) for both parties in your standard heterosexual relationship. I feel like it's a great way to fuck a mile in your partner's shoes. Here's a little of what you might take away:

**For guys:**

* Face fucking can be a little overwhelming. Some people have more sensitive gag reflexes than others, tearing up, and doing all kinds of involuntary things if your partner's a bit too aggressive with the oral penetration. This may give you a little perspective when these roles are switched.

* Things in your ass can feel pretty damn awesome. And if it worries you

* Things in your ass can also feel bad. I feel like everyone knows this on some level

**For girls:**

* Holy crap, fucking with a dick is so different from fucking with a vagina. It's *a lot* more work. You'll come to appreciate the stamina that goes into swordplay a lot more once you've acted as the penetrating party. 

* Positioning yourself in doggy style is hilariously difficult at times. Differences in height can really affect your success. Your best bet is to grab the hips and plunge away

* Being gentle isn't quite intuitive. It's so tempting to start thrusting maniacally, it's a good idea to just let it sit there for a little while your partner adjusts, then slowly work up to actually fucking. 

* Lube lube lube lube lube lube lube lube

* If he's into it

**Other things to think about:**

* Using a stiffer dildo will make it easier to penetrate

* Dat reacharound. If the guy's on his back though

* If you're flexible, but ya know...).

I may come back and update this later

1375139693.0,1jb74r,My fetish of having my boyfriend have sex with other women is becoming an obsession and I'm afraid it's unhealthy.,loveotherwomen,1502,417,183,"My boyfriend (25m) and I (24f) have been together for 2 years


About six months into our relationship, the look on his face when he discovers a new pussy for the first time is overwhelmingly hot and **c)** I like hooking up with friends more than strangers/randoms. 


Over time we’ve had a couple more threesomes and he’s hooked up with one of my best friends one on one a couple times and he’s flirted with a few girls (with my encouragement). I’ve only had to veto once because I really didn’t trust the girl’s intentions (and I later discovered my gut was spot-on).


As we foray deeper into this fetish (which is more like an obsession. It’s almost all I can think about) I’m starting to realize it’s a lot more complex than me being turned on by sex


**1)** I can only get off to imagining him with other women. Sometimes we masturbate with me watching him masturbate to other women on GW. We still have loving one on on sex on the regular but this fetish is so strong I feel unsatisfied if we don’t have a current prospect for him.


**2)** About prospects


**3)** Thinking about him with other women leads to a strange combination of arousal, sometimes I’m angry at him, sometimes I want to prove myself the best, sometimes I’m just really fucking horny and want him to tell me about it while he fucks me. I really can’t control it and sometimes it can affect our relationship but he’s excellent at after-care. The arousal always tends to beat out all the other emotions in the end though.


**4)** Speaking of proving myself


**5)** I’m not interested in polyamory so I’m afraid I’m playing with fire here. I love when he goes on dates and tenderly kisses and makes love to other women but I absolutely do not want him to fall in love or have a relationship with them beyond close friends with benefits. This is why ideally I love when he hooks up with our mutual friends because I know there is an intimacy between the three of us and the girl he’s with won’t see me as a threat and try to undercut me. I know I can’t control his heart but this is such a great fear for me.


**6)** I have no interest in swinging or being with other men in any fashion. The idea makes me sick. I guess it goes back to the inadequacy thing but I like being only his but him not being only mine. Being with another man would ruin the fetish for me completely.


**7)** Sometimes I pressure him to pursue women and I should back off and let things develop organically. Really no advice you can give me here


I think I covered it as well as I could, how do you reconcile all the opposing feelings?

I'm happy and we're happy. I'm a beautiful woman with a great job

Here`s something you can work on regardless of your insecurities

1. Be dominant and give yourself time to tease the shit out of her. Consider foreplay as a fun kind of torture to understand it better and tease her before she gets to see or touch you. 
2. Run your fingers around her neck and arms while you kiss her. 
3. Run you hands lower around her breasts WITHOUT touching them
4. Occasionally brush over her nipples, but maintain that power! 
5. Keep this power game of teasing up so that she almost has to beg for you to touch her. 
6. Move on to the next hot points between her thighs with the same teasing technique. Run your fingers up and down her legs
7. Move your fingers inside of her pants or panties if she still has them on
8. Repeat steps 1-7 all over again...remember you still havent touched her pussy yet. I promise she`ll be soaking wet (!EDIT! or generally aroused)  by the time you get to it.
9. When you finally get to her pussy, whlie avoiding her clitoris and putting anything inside yet. 
10. Rub around it
11. Run through steps 1-10 again. I think you see what`s going on here! TEASE! 
12. Eventually when you do touch her clitoris with your fingers
13. At this point you can also enter 1 finger inside her slowly
14. Do the same steps 7-13 with your mouth. 
15. Use your fingers inside her while you suck her clit. In porn I`ve seen that men often lick
16. At this point she`ll most likely be demanding your penis

I really hope this helps some men and perhaps women who want to know what great foreplay can feel like. I know that there are many other things

TL;DR Toture your lover

**Update: Also very graphic and NSFW (ofc).**
So im back:D. Here i will kinda bullet point it and i will answer any questions you have in the comments

-When i arrived she greeted me in sexy underwear. she was a little older than i thought from the pictures but it didn't really bother me.

-I was kinda worried after reading a post below that i wouldn't be able to get hard until i entered her bed room

-handed over the cash and she told me to strip off (i'm not a great writer so i'm just going to say every thing straight.) I did tell her i was a virgin and i dono what i expected to happen but it was a total non-issue.

-I lay on the bed and she put the condom on me then started blowing me. It didnt feel like i expected it to but it was still great

-She got on top of me and started riding me (no penetration yet). then she put it in and started fucking me. i know now im not into the back and forth motion i like the up and down more. i went on top pinning her legs back like they do in porn thrusting is a lot harder than it looks in the movies. put her legs over to the side and started fucking her that way. I then got up and bent her over the bed and fucked her doggy.

-after a bit i lay on the bed again and she finished me off and it wasn't easy. i just wouldn't cum. she got some lube and really started going at it. seems i probably grip too hard when i jerk off which i guess i need to stop doing. 

-when i came i have never really done it without anything to catch it so i wasn't expecting it to shoot over my shoulder and onto the pillow.

few things i learned

Would i do it again? probably not but that said i don't regret it. It was a great time.

About two and a half years ago I was on holiday in Germany and I had a car accident. I'm told it was pretty horrific but I don't remember anything about it. I was in a coma for a month and a half before I woke up. I don't remember anything from 2 days prior the crash.

Once I woke up my leg was broken and so were 3 of my ribs. Although they had been healing along nicely during my coma. I was told all of this by my father

However there was one thing he left out and I had to wait for my doctor to tell me this: In the accident some crushed/flying/tearing metal pretty much cut off my penis and mangled my balls. He told me I was never going to have children or have sex again. Over the next few weeks I had staged surgeries to restructure my urethra using the lining of my mouth.

After that I went back home and eventually started college. I made some friends but have never told anyone about my situation. The only people who knew were the surgeons in Germany and my father. And then later I guess my doctor here and my therapist.

I have never had a girlfriend

For the first year or so I was extremely depressed and went to therapist's and for a while I took anti depressants which I am now off. I no longer feel depressed

Every time I see a post on reddit whining about how they are forever alone or how they are terrible with woman, and because no one actually knows.

Maybe in time I might find a woman to will enjoy spending time with me

I also am extremely pissed off with myself. Why did I have to be that shy

Obviously this is a throwaway account. My friends know my original one and I don't want them finding out by a post on reddit. I am also not sure where to put this. At first I thought I'd make this an IAMA but I realized I don't want to answer a load of questions. I just needed to get this off my chest. So now it is either reddit.com or sex. I think I'll just dump it in sex.

Pretty much as the title says
We got married 7 years ago. We were both average weight when we got married. I put on a lot of weight, she cheated on me. I was obese then and hating myself, but at the time I figured I pretty much deserved to be cheated on (again, *at the time*.) I reacted to it by killing myself to get in shape.  
    
For the last three years I’ve done everything I could to make myself a better person. I started going to the gym three times a week. Then every day. Now I spend two hours a day in the gym. I went from an obese BMI from fat to an “obese” BMI from muscle. 8% bodyfat. Actual abs (which I never had), which never happened to me ever and now happens a few times a week.    
  
I’m really proud of all the work I’ve done. But the more I did
  
My wife started eating a lot. I’m okay with this. I know how it feels to be addicted to food. She’s gained a lot of weight. I’m okay with this
  
On those rare occasions when we DO have sex, etc. But she pushes me off, always, after a few minutes, saying she can’t stand the thought of me touching “her fat body.” 
  
I thought it was ALL just bad body image, and that looking at me with my shirt off, or whatever, “makes [her] hate herself and want to die.” She also told me that she wishes I would gain weight again so we could be “together again.” Which I don’t even understand. What does that mean? She also told me that I am going to cheat on her because “now I can have anyone I want.” Which is *bullshit*. The only person I want is her, and I can’t have her!  
  
It’s important for me to say a couple of things:  
1. I love my wife. I really DO think she’s sexy. Sexier than before in some ways.  
2. I never
3. We have attempted sex about once a month for the last six months. EVERY TIME she’s pushed me off and started crying and insulting herself.  
4. The reason I’m not submitting this to r/relationships is because outside of sex, we go on trips. She laughs at my stupid jokes, I tell her how beautiful she is about 10 times a day and I mean it. When my shirt comes off, or worse, when hers does, then and only then do things start to go wrong.  
  
I just want to help my wife feel more comfortable with her body in general and around me. I want to help her feel more sexual without hating herself. I want her to be happy for me and not feel bad because she’s put on weight that I find sexy anyhow. What can I do to help her?

As we've grown closer this past year she has gotten me to open up a great deal sexually, touching it, smelling it, the whole getup, it's just too awesome! So, this brings me to my next point.

When we're together and aren't doing much of anything, fit for a princess, while sitting in bed doing nothing. We are excellent with communicating, but she has difficulty doing anything of a sexual nature without it being the perfect time and place.

Before my wifes (female) friends could say anything both their husbands say words to the effect of ""I'd never let my wife go topless"".

This surprised me on two levels. Firstly I love the idea of other men checking out my wifes breasts and I assumed that everyone else felt the same way about their wives. Secondly I have zero control over what my wife wears (or does not in this case) and she would flip if I told her to cover up.

A few months ago, and packed duct tape and a hose into my car. Carbon monoxide poisoning seemed to be the way to go. I drove to a nearby pub and spent three hours downing scotch to boost my courage. The plan was to drive to a place I'd picked out in a nearby park and run the hose from my exhaust to my car's cabin. Notes were left for the people I thought would care.

As I was leaving the deserted bar, but she said she'd been hitting on me for a year or so. I guess I was oblivious.

Before I could stop her, so what went down is probably rather junior-highish by the standards of most of the people reading this, but it was still a fantastic experience. Her lips were soft and coated with some sort of nice-tasting lip gloss, and I can't describe how good it felt to have simple physical contact with another human being, to hold her hand and embrace her. Due to my condition, continuing things beyond simple kissing would have been impossible but I was so elated and buzzed that all the plans I had of killing myself evaporated.

1353400781.0,13i22i,Thank you /r/sex for turning my marriage in to a fucking dream come true,aspiring_sexpert,1519,512,184,"First of all

A couple of days ago, sex, and reading posts from [/r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) as well as committing myself to [/r/nofap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) (to which I also owe a huge thanks to)

It was Thursday and we had been almost two weeks without sex.  Sadly, Kegels, no porn, [/r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) tips, etc… a sudden readiness came rushing in on Thursday morning.  It was time.

I started the morning by sending my wife texts while she was at work.  Gentle at first, all she had to do was follow my lead” and “All I can promise you is you are going to cum, hard and a lot”  She was a bit shy in her responses but very interested and I could tell she was getting herself revved up and turned on… I then began setting up.  

I went up to the bedroom and gathered the items to create a sort of schoolgirl outfit I always wanted her to wear for me along with a cute pair of panties and bra.  I placed the panties in my sock drawer with a little note telling her to freshen up now if she felt the need

In the second drawer, a pair of knee-high socks, and a pair of heals.  These were accompanies by a second note which instructed her to go to a small bag placed under my nightstand.

In the bag were a couple of sex toys, and finally to “Hope she wasn’t in too much trouble”
Everything was a go, but we’ll get to that).

The next few hours when she came home were tough, I had her in the kitchen as she was doing the dishes.. I came up behind her and pulled her up against me, kissing and brushing my hands teasingly all over.  As soon as I heard the heavy breathing and felt her body going slightly limp against mine, I began kissing her neck and teasing around her breast and groin til I heard soft moans.  It was time!  I slid my hand up along her body , then gently grabbed her hair and gently pulled her head back to expose her neck.. kissed her there a few times, and then told her “Go upstairs and look in my top drawer, you’ll know what to do from there”.  Obedient and sexy as ever, she was off.  

The 20 minutes following were nerve racking.  We had never done anything like this and I had no idea how she was going to respond, and went upstairs.

When I opened the door, she was playing along and slowly embracing her role, even changing her voice slightly.. but still not yet fully immersed.  Finally I told her that “I would forgive her, but first she needed to be punished” Without any hesitation, I sat on the bed, pulled her across my lap, and laid a firm slap on her ass.  Bang!  And like that

As I alternated between firm slaps and rubbing her ass

I next told her that I was going to remind her of what a real cock was like as I threw the small vibrator to the side.  I put her on my knees and told her to pull it out of my pants, I told her to stand up, turned her back to the bed, and the pushed her down on it.

I loved being in total control like this.  When I wanted her shirt up.. I told her to remove it.  I aggressively lifted her bra to help myself to her tits and body in general.  Anything I wanted her to do, constantly reminding her of what a bad girl she was, and that I was going to make her cum however much I wanted as punishment.   She couldn’t get enough and would alternate between moaning and begging in response. 

After she was tied up, constantly acting like my tongue was about to enter her, then pulling away. Once I had her pleading for  me to taste her, I’d slightly go in, and then pull away again telling her I didn’t think she was ready for it and went back up to her breasts or other places.  She was squirming a whimpering so much that it was driving me wild.  Finally after one final tease, I let my tongue go in and then licked up the entire length of her pussy.  She lost it within seconds and was bucking her hips and crying out in an intense orgasm.  

At this point, she was screaming in ecstasy, trying to hold it in till I commanded her to let it go and commanding her to cum hard for me.   The orgasm she had was the most incredible/beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.  As the orgasm washed over her, her body went tense and started quivering uncontrollably and her face went into what I can only describe as a scream that was so intense it couldn’t get out… so she held there for a good 20 seconds, body shaking intensely and mouth open in a silent scream.  When the sound finally escaped it was more like a roar of insane pleasure and she started convulsing all over.. I thought she was going to pass out. 

Again, and then went back to work on her pussy.  

Finally came the time for me to go into her, thinking I was going to tease again, I pushed into her hard as she cried out.   

I don’t think I was ever so big or so hard in my life… she also made it known to me multiple times how big I was and deep in I was going.  This is where the practice of self-control and kegel exercises started to come into play.  At one point, and drove deep into her.  The orgasm that followed was as intense as the G-spot orgasm with the added emotion you can only get from fucking… it was beautiful.  The only hard part was trying to stay inside her as her body was thrashing about.  Finally when it was my time to cum, I told her I was going to cum all over her.  She cried yes as I pulled out and covered her body… It was incredible and the first time I ever came on her like that.  Afterwards, I fell next to her making sure to give her one more orgasm so as not to leave her hanging, and then just lay there next to her as she was panting, speechless and staring at the ceiling.  After she was able to talk again, all she could say over and over was how amazing it was and how much she loved it.  We made out a good 20 minutes more before finally breaking away to the shower to clean up.

The best part about this is, we are making out or rubbing our hands along each other’s body.  

The love we feel for each other has also unleashed. I always loved her, inches away and knowing they were destined to touch, but not quite able to meet until that night.  I don’t know why it happened after this, but I love it.  The best example of this was the day after.  I can’t describe the experience and do it  anything close to justice.  After hours of not being able to keep our hands off each other, we finally put the kid down for a nap and made love.  It was seriously the most sensual, emotional, loving

Also, but clearly she looks upon me as her dominant man.  Again, I can’t fully explain it, but it is like she has completely surrendered herself to me.   Emotionally and sometimes physically (Like now she loves for me to just pick her up, put her on my lap and rest her head on my shoulder  while we are watching TV or whatever).  For the first time in my life, I feel like I am finally fulfilling my role as the man and I can tell she finally feels like she can let go and be all woman.  Everything is perfect and words can’t describe how happy we both are right now.  (If anyone has insight as to why this happened after that night, please let me know).

I posted this because I’m hoping it inspires any couples (or singles) who were, but hesitant to do so.   If by giving in to what you truly want, you feel even a fraction of what my wife and I feel right now, I promise you you’ll never regret it.  Thanks for listening!

The two major things that can ruin a good blow job experience:

* You don't say anything.

Communication is key. I'm not talking about giving the girl instructions while you go at it, she will happily meet your requests. Personally, I hate feeling like I might be doing something wrong because the guy is completely silent until I am surprised by a mouthful of semen. Which brings me to another facet of this bullet point: warning before you cum is always appreciated. Though it is possible to tell through physical signs that the moment is near, it is not always so obvious. Every girls wants to make that climax as pleasurable as possible. When you're close, we want to know and be able to step up our game and take you over that edge. Heaven forbid I choose to slow down for a minute or take a breath of air just as you're getting close and then the tension that's been building is lost.

* I am about to throw up.

Some women can handle a large cock hitting the back of their throat for minutes on end, so please let me do the work so I can take some strategic breaths of air, set a rhythm that the back of my throat can handle, and maintain my composure, rather than you continually thrusting your penis into my mouth or pushing my head down on you cock. Go ahead and pull my hair and put your hands on my head and feel me going up and down on you but please, do not gag me with your penis! If I have no control over a large hard object hitting the back of throat over and over, I feel like I am about to throw up. If I have a stuffy nose and your cock is rammed down my throat, it is a passage way to my lungs and stomach and can't take a pounding. Consider this.

So we invited him over and talked to him about it and he was totally on board. 

So last night was the night. We decided that my wife would watch and if she or either of us got uncomfortable we would discuss it and figure something out. She was on the recliner while we were sitting on the couch. And then it started we started kissing and that part wasn't so great for me to be honest. his tongue was much rougher than a females. before long he had unbuttoned my pants and was stroking me. i was really hard he was pretty good with his hand. then he went down and started giving me a bj. the man was amazing. after about a minute i had to tell him to stop or i would cum. i undid his pants and pulled his dick out. it was rock hard and i gave it a few strokes with my and then took a deep breath and put it in my mouth.

so much was going through my mind. like oh my god am I gay? i finally did it

I still had not cum yet so he proceeded to give me an incredible bj and i came. i felt like a new person. all the weight i had felt over this was gone. we then had some beers and played Cards Against Humanity for a couple hours.

1354917547.0,14gt5x,Got deepthroated while cumming. Anyone else experience this? (warning: long and graphic),Minty233,1465,489,386,"I'm a 25 year old male and fairly well-endowed (a little over 8""). And---whodathunkit?!---I've always wanted to feel what it's like to get deepthroated. None of that brutal gagging/mascara-running-down-face crap marketed in porn these days; a woman who can effortlessly and enthusiastically take a dick all the way down her throat.

I'm self-aware enough to know that this isn't an easy topic to bring up to a girl because: a) I should be counting my lucky stars that I'm getting head in the first place, I'd back off. 

I've been hooking up on-and-off with this 20-year-old girl I met a few months ago. Within a couple of encounters, and she basically makes me disappear down her throat. I've spent a good chunk of my life wondering what this feels like, and the result was a million times hotter than I ever anticipated. It's impossible to hold back my moans---just one loud, glorious sigh after another every single time I hit the back of her throat. There's no gagging whatsoever. No deep breaths beforehand. No sore throat after. Only precaution she takes is not eating 2 hours beforehand. Best part: she enjoys doing it, integrating it as much as possible into her regular oral routine.

Cut to last week. I'm getting close to orgasm, I ask her to try to keep me in her throat while I'm cumming. Just as I'm about to burst, she takes me all the way down. What happened next is like piecing together a murder scene. 

The tightness of her throat and the subsequent pressure on my dick must have delayed my orgasm for a few seconds; it was like shutting off a faucet

I had to throw a pillow over my face to muffle my screams. I felt like I blacked out for a millisecond. My arms and legs were visibly shaking for the next 10 minutes; it took another 15 before I could even stand up. I had the most gloriously splitting headache. Oh, did you cum?"" I mean, this was obviously right before she noticed the cum oozing out of me, but every shot down her throat (maybe 7 to 10 streams?) went completely unnoticed. 

Sexxit, I'll ask you: has anyone else been as fortunate to experience this? Is it a once-in-a-while thing or on a regular basis? It's no-strings-attached with the girl of the story, so I need to make every second count. 

I need to go masturbate now. Cheers.

Edit: Let me be clear, and in most cases you can't smell it. The smell I am talking about is a pungent scent that in all seriousness makes me gag. 

Edit2: Apparently some women are taking what I said to imply that a man knowing you are on your period is bad or you should be ashamed of being on your period.

Lucky for me, go wash up, get a drink of water, whatever you need to do. Once you're done, go into the bedroom and open the top drawer of our dresser. Inside, you'll find a present and an outfit. First, put on the outfit, nothing more and nothing less [it was thigh-highs, but don't use it [was a new g-spot vibrator]. Next

 We made out for a bit before she instructed me to strip. I guess she wanted to assess the equipment and evaluate me as a bed partner or something along those lines. I guess this is what most women do, even when erect so I thought it was all in working order. When I learned about how it was meant to pull back, I tried it on myself but the pain was incredible, so I got it checked and I had an operation a couple of months later. That was when I was 17. Those who are circumcised at birth have it way easier. Waking up in the middle of the night with an erection that you got in your sleep when none of the stitches have disolved yet is not pleasant to say the least. There is a slight scar and some excess tissue left from where it turned out that my foreskin was fused with the glans since birth, but everything works fine, or so I thought. 

Fast forward something like eight years and here I am standing completely nude in front of this girl who can't stop staring. She started laughing a bit, but she said she had to think about it and asked me to leave. I felt completely worthless. I do not think that I have ever felt so weak before.

First, with more time taken at the weekends or whenever we have the energy.  We're busy, have kids, get tired, get stressed - but we try to connect daily as it brings us together.  We probably had more when first married and before kids, but I'm happy with what we have today ( I know its more than average - and I'm just fine with not being the average!).  We've been lucky with each other but looking back, I knew she loved sex and had a high drive before we married - and I knew that suited me - so I guess that set us up well for marriage.  I'm really not qualified to give advice at all

Second, I can stop and re-position to lengthen a session, but if we're having a quickie, then its, well, quick.  Quicker than when I was younger.  Wife can't cum from vaginal sex but gets genuinely upset if I don't cum.  So, over the years, cumming is like cake with icing on top.  And we all love cake.  When we have more time

She is also afraid of vaginas. Her own

She doesn't really like anything but PIV sex, for various reasons. I've tried to go down on her before but she has never really let me. 

The point of this is that I've never really gotten a good look at the inside of her vagina before. That area is very .. closed? I guess? How do you describe female genitalia? Anyways.

So the other day she comes over and things are kinda getting going and she says before we do anything she wants to take a shower. She goes and takes a shower and she comes back and we get going. We have some sex and then I actually get her to agree to let me go down on her. 

I get in position and then I kinda spread open her vulva ... and it's freaking disgusting. There's this goopy yellowish stuff in all the folds

I don't say anything about it. I kinda lick and kiss around her legs and stuff. She's never had anyone do this so she doesn't know what it is supposed to feel like. I'm so turned off I don't know what to do.

She just got out of the shower. I imagine she cleaned down there. What does that mean? That she never cleans herself well and completely? That she doesn't know how? 

I don't think I can bring it up to her, because all I can think about is her disgusting vagina. 

What do I do? I imagine people will tell me to talk to her about it; I imagine that that's the only real answer here, but I have to imagine it's not THAT difficult. Uggghhh someone save me.

1361207935.0,18rcih,[UPDATE] Valentine's Day Facial,curious1111,1173,274,50,"Last week I made a post (http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/18g7rm/my_boyfriend_has_been_begging_me_to_let_him_give/)
 asking you all for advice on how to receive a facial properly from my bf for a special Valentine's Day. I promised an update so here it is:


First off, take it from me **it's not that bad!**.

Long story short, and went at it for a while. If I come first, I usually let him keep working and pull out when he's ready and he just comes on my stomach or boobs. This time when he said he was coming soon and asked me where I wanted it I looked him in the eye while he was on top of me and said ""I want it on my face baby"". He literally stopped thrusting and gave me a very confused ""What? Really?"", and I said ""Yes, I want your come on my face tonight."" 

The look on his face was very hard to describe, and 90% excitement. He said that me just saying that nearly made him lose it. I actually got turned on by the fact that he was so turned on. So I did what you guys suggested and told him I was going to get on my knees and wait for him to do his part. I was still a little nervous about it all so I laid out directions, that when he was ready he could pull out of my mouth and point and shoot himself, so I could just sit there and ""enjoy"" the moment.

When the big moment came he told me he was ready and pulled out, all my negative feelings went away as soon as that first rope hit my forehead and went down to my nose. Another one hit my cheek and some drops hit my lips/went in my mouth. 

Luckily I didn't feel anything around my eye so after it was over I opened them up and looked up at my man. He looked like he was on Cloud 9 and kept telling me over and over again ""that was so hot"" or ""you look so hot"" or ""wow you're hot"". He looked so incredibly pleased and happy, then just laid in bed.

Overall

**tl;dr - Was nervous about receiving facial. Let BF do it. Made him ridiculously happy/turned-on which in turn made me ridiculously happy/turned-on. Was totally harmless and will definitely incorporate it into regular sexual line-up**",self,t5_2qh3p,1361238502.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/18rcih/update_valentines_day_facial/

I begin licking. No reaction

My breath feels cool in my mouth and I begin to smell the familiar medicinal odor. I exhale really hard a few times so the fumes can start doing their thing.

At that moment

""What is what?"" I respond.

""What is that smell? It smells like a cough drop."" She then adds

I really think I'm rocking her world. ""Yeah

I follow her. She's standing with one leg up on the sink feverishly splashing water between her legs. She asks if I put a cough drop into my mouth. I say yes and she asks what the fuck was I thinking.

""It didn't feel good?"" I ask.

The most common response is that the SO has chosen YOU, by the way, but we'll get to that). While I understand this argument, and is an important thought when considering your overall relationship, people seem to be having a hard time separating this fact from what I believe to be the underlying concern. I shall elaborate, but not without a wee backstory first.

I have been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years,"" were attractive, and all the normal stuff that normally causes this to become an issue. For me, it has only very rarely come to bother me. That being said, if I am stricken with a feeling of jealousy or insecurity, the notion that my SO has chosen ""me"" offers me very little consolation, for the following reasons:

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING ARE JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE MALE INSECURITIES REGARDING THIS

1. DEFINITIONS OF ""GOOD SEX:"" From what I've both heard and witnessed time and time and time again, the sex is often deemed ""better"" overall with someone they care about or offers a better total package in the relationship. The problem with this is that sex can be a very primal thing for men a lot of the time, where you want to ""rock her world"" and be the ""best she's ever had."" You don't want to be ""the best she's ever had, because you make her breakfast and care about her and are a great friend who listens and cuddles."" Whereas ""Billy the Donkey Dicked Male Model/Fireman of the Year"" felt amazing and could fuck her in ways you never imagined, but was not very nice and never stayed the night. Men want to be Billy in the bedroom, because the rest just doesn't factor in as much to us. And while ""a Billy"" might have been in your SO's past, she'd still tell you that you're the best she's ever had because a.) she loves you and wants to make you feel good and b.) because in many ways the amount that she loves you actually DOES make sex with you the best. Unfortunately, but as far as sex (and I feel like this is where the majority of concerns come from)

2. SHE'S WITH YOU SO YOU ARE THE BEST, I just don't like seeing the fact that a SO is currently dating someone as proof that they're the best and should feel as such. 

3. THE PHALLUS AND ITS UNBREAKABLE CONNECTION TO THE MALE PSYCHE: Men have the penis, and then you start dating and have sex, your penis is the one she is stuck with. It could be great, it could be terrible. Very few decent people would leave someone they love because of the size of their penis. But the reality is that it could make for significantly worse sex, and the fact that she cares about you ""makes up for it."" That is out of your control and you have no idea how you measure up or how good it actually feels. No amount of cunnilingus or anything else matters to the average male self esteem. I love pleasing my SO through sex and all forms of hand and mouth play, but the only thing factoring into how good I feel about myself is how the PIV is. This is something that is very very difficult for women to understand because they think they have the equivalent of penis size in breasts. Dear women: This is untrue for so many reasons, but the main being that anybody can tell how big your breasts are right away. If I meet you, woo you, well then the more important part is that your breasts aren't all too relevant in the bedroom when it comes to intercourse. AA's or DD's, you can take a while to get wet sometimes

/end

The point is, sweetest, or anything your SO has ever had. And your chances of this only decline as the number of previous partners increases. Unfortunately, you just have to get over it. The fact that you want to be the best in bed is just something you have to move beyond, and you just have to try to think like a woman in regards to how good sex can feel when you really care about a person. Do I believe that I am the best sex that my SO has ever had? Maybe, probably, considering I am her first serious relationship and her first real love. Am I the best sex she's ever had in the way that I care about? Probably not, and I have to get over it. In fact

So I hope you enjoyed the insight into the male psyche, but these actions are not without consequence when it comes to this particularly irrational part of the male mind.

**EDIT:** Thanks for replies. I think that a lot of people don't fully understand certain aspects of my post.
* This is a post explaining what I feel previous posts concerning ""my SO's numerous other partners
* There are plenty of threads explaining why size doesn't matter, but like was mentioned before: that has very little to do with a man's feeling of inadequacy. Even if that monster dick from your SO's previous partner hurt her and made sex difficult, it is very difficult for many to not feel like ""less of a man"" because of it.


This is not a new concept in society:
Ezekiel 23:20 (a book written by the men with insecurity issues a few thousand years ago):
""She lusted after her paramous there
This is then painted as sinful and terrible and monogamy is reinforced because even back then

**Final Edit:** Thank you to those who took the time to read and understand my post, for some reason, it took a lot out of me to not defend myself against a good deal of these comments. Some were very sweet as per usual but simply did not understand what I was saying, and quite a few were very personally directed at me. This will be the last time I clarify this, and only because it diminishes my original post significantly if you simply saw it as a rant over my inability to feel secure in myself:
I AM IN A VERY HAPPY RELATIONSHIP. MY SEX IS GREAT, simply because I've addressed it. I am in many ways playing devil's advocate to the majority of the sentiments I've seen around lately, and ""representing"" feelings that a likely majority of us have had at some point or another. I did this because during moments when I *have* felt doubt or jealousy, it doesn't feel good to be told that you're okay for 'XYZ' reasons, when a lot of us are actually feeling them because of reasons 'ABC.' I simply felt these feelings haven't been given enough justice in previous arenas regarding this issue, and wanted to see them expressed in a manner that I think more accurately lays them out.",,self,,

Well, amazingly attractive, financially stable - everything I could have asked for. There was just one issue. He would  not go down on me.

Conversation after conversation would ensue

Oh, the taste of his precum and the way he tangles his hands in my hair and his little moans. Turning him on turns ME on, and it was always a great way to heat things up really quick. And yet he never ventured down there on me. Before sex he would finger me, or rub himself on me, and once or twice he licked his finger and slid it in. But mouth never went below bellybutton. What on earth was I doing wrong?

I explained to him how much I enjoyed getting head

Then, kissing him. He suddenly stopped me and said he wasn't in the mood, he had to go to work soon and he didn't want to get all sweaty before his shift. Okay, says I, cool as a cucumber. He looked at me and could see I was a little disappointed. ""I'll make it up to you tonight,"" he promised, a little mischief in his eye. Nice

That night, touching each other teasingly, a stroke there, a kiss here. We get out and dry off. He takes me to our bedroom and lays me on the bed, naked, and we start kissing. First, little tiny kisses, he pushes my and away and starts moving down to my breasts. Okay, I am twisting and moaning and doing all kinds of horizontal acrobatics. Then he starts kissing down my stomach. I literally almost panic. What is he doing. He never does this. Who the hell is this and what has he done with my beloved boyfriend. 

Then he moves to my inner thigh, and then he slides over to my right thigh and starts the work there. Today is the day I die. I am sure. I will die from how good this feels. Yep. Finally, he stops the wet kisses on my skin and just looks up at me with those gorgeous green eyes. He's grinning like an idiot and I probably have the dumbest look on my face - parts confusion and desire and need - and, meeting my gaze the entire time, he slowly drags his tongue from the bottom of my lips all the way to the clit. 

Sexxit.... I am not kidding... I almost blacked out. He was so amazing at it. As expected, from being so turned on he could barely stand it, and we just completely collapsed. I had a weird ringing in my ear. My legs were jello. And I love him.

He promised it wouldn't be a one-time thing, and there have been a few - not even his ex-wife) then he must really love me. Having sex with a girl is one thing, it could be any girl really. But willingly going outside your comfort zone to make a girl happy speaks volumes. 

Just wanted to share my happiness and thanks for reading :)) 

EDIT - A lot of people asked about my ""down-there"" hygiene. As I said I do practice good hygiene, etc etc. I have tasted myself before and I taste actually pretty decent, I've smelled/seen some nasty vaginas and mine is actually a very faint smell and just that slightly metallic-y scent. Sort of tangy tasting. Not particularly flavorful. So no, I don't think it was anything to do with my appearance or smell or taste. It was just his little issue - and now *our* accomplishment :D

Anyway

1.)What exactly am I supposed to do during this? Do I look at him while he's coming? Do I close my eyes? Do I open my mouth? 

2.) What is the best position to ""receive""? Should I be lying down

3.) Do guys like it when you help them

4.) What am I supposed to do post-facial? Do I try to kiss him? I doubt he'd be into that. How long do I just stay there with his come on my face? What should I say to him? 

5.) Finally, have you had any experience breaking out (e.g. - is getting come on your face bad for your skin?)

I've posted this before but it really annoys me that more people don't know this so I decided to share it here again

A year or so ago I found a book called the multi-orgasmic man while sifting through the torrents. A lot of it sounded like eastern religious claptrap but it also contained some very useful techniques invented by the Taoists

Now, slow down, breathe slower (lowers your heart rate), think of un-arousing things and be sure to keep your muscles relaxed. Also, stopping for a minute or less when you get close will help you stretch out the time and get your dick used to taking a long time to reach orgasm. Try to notice the different stages in your own arousal, especially when you near orgasm.

You will also need to become aware of your kegel muscles and strengthen them. To do this

Okay, get as close as you can without actually ejaculating then stop for a few seconds before restarting slowly. Learn exactly how far you can go before you know you will ejaculate. Do this multiple times in a session, as many times as you can before losing control. At some point in one of these runs you will notice your prostate/kegel/perineum contracting rhythmically, like it does when you ejaculate except without anything coming out of your penis. Concentrate on that feeling, lay a finger lightly on your perineum, whatever to make sure you know when it is happening. What you have just done it disassociated your orgasm from your ejaculation. The first one won't feel like much. The second one in each session will be more intense. The third more intense still. Each successive orgasm within the same session will be more intense than the last and there is nothing stopping you - save physical exhaustion - from having as many as you like. My current record is nine in a row. You may also find that when you do finally ejaculate that your cock will stay hard allowing you to keep going should you wish, though may only happen about one time in ten.

There is also nothing stopping you from learning how to do this during sex, so there may well be other nuggets of wisdom in it. Do tell me if you find any.

That's when I see it.

Police lights.

Being the calm, I politely and promptly alerted my car companion of the potential danger by ejaculating ""SHIT IT'S THE POLICE GET YOUR PANTS ON"" as I fumbled around in the dark for my own. My boxers seemed to think this was an excellent time to play make-every-hole-not-the-hole-you-put-your-legs-in, so I kicked them under the front seat and pulled my shorts over my latex-armored warrior. Being the thoughtful chap I am, I immediately looked over to see how my comrade was getting along and if she required any assistance.

""I can't get my pants on"" she says looking at me with a face stricken with raw animalistic terror. The police car is now very clearly headed straight for us. ""GET YOUR FUCKING PANTS ON

We were abruptly and shockingly washed in a wave of white light ten-thousand times brighter than the sun streaming in through the window. I see my girlfriend gazing wide-eyed into the light of death and give a half-hearted wave accompanied by a weaker smile.

The spotlight is gone.

I wouldn't realize it until later

Sometime in the next fifteen seconds my girlfriend squeezed her torso through one of the leg holes of her shorts and stuck a leg through each of the remaining holes. From a distance

The police officer - cool as a cucumber - strolls up to the window and motions with his flashlight to open it. I smile and nod as I tried to remember how windows work.

""Good evening!"" he greeted joyfully.

""H-h-KAH."" I found my voice. ""Hello officer.""

""You guys just talking?"" he winked knowingly. 

""Y-yes sir"" I smoothly retorted.

""Good

""Thank you sir"" we replied in unison - our hearts beating fast enough to have become one continuous indistinguishable pounding.

We could go from casually talking about it to arguing about it and it always came back to same thing: he just doesn't have a sex drive. Someone in my first post suggested watching porn can kill libido, he said he did not do it often but had been doing it recently. I know this is normal, but it hurt. To me it seemed what little horniness he musters up, he turns to his computer rather than his own girlfriend.

1282655941.0,d4tz6,Dirty Talk 101 - Talking Dirty to a Girl,,1039,242,490,"I wrote this lighthearted guide after reading MySexxitAcct's ""Failed Dirty Talking 101"" post.  Dirty talking was abruptly introduced to my sex life a few years ago
    
    
**Why talk dirty?**

In the years following my recovery from the awkwardness surrounding the loss of my virginity, bodily arrangement, or a special set of places and timings to press or rub that would activate the orgasm cheat code.

A few years ago

Dirty talk is the closest thing to the ""magic technique"" I've ever found.  Do it right and she'll come faster

**But when I talk dirty I sound stupid!**

Yeah, after all, the only thing that sounds stupider than loud sex is silent sex.

**What do I need to know first?**

Her limits.  But

Most women want to be dominated and objectified... in the comfort of a safe consenting setting with a man they trust and care about to some degree.  This is a statistical law, but I've found it to be overwhelmingly true.

Additionally

**Ok

All over the place

First, don't use it (not for a while, at least).  These are simple things, when in doubt err slightly on the side of caution.  You can always escalate things tomorrow or next week.

**No

Ok

The key to success is saying the right thing at the right time.  The limits of what is acceptable/appropriate will move all over the place during the course of a sexual encounter.  Telling a girl you're going to ""fuck her little pussy raw"" when you start snuggling up on the couch might be fine with some chicks.  With others it will break the mood

**Enough of your bullshit

Fine

There's an old saying that dirty talk is just saying ""What I'm going to do to you, but with a little thought we can be more engaging.

Let's break it up into three regions of the dirty-talk spectrum: tame, be creative!

*Tame* - these warm things up during foreplay and as foreplay transitions into sex.  Be suggestive

* *God you smell/look good*
* *I've been thinking about you all day/I know you've been thinking about me all day*
* *Fuck
* *I can taste you on my lips already (when you're about to go down on her)*
* *Fuck
* *Guess what?  You're mine tonight*
* *I can't even tell you the filthy things I've been thinking about all day/thinking about doing to you*
* Look how hard you've got me/Look how wet I've made you
* I'm gonna make you scream

*Dirty* - these are for while you're going at it

* *Oh yeah
* *Fuck
* *Who's my sexy little girl/bitch/whore/slut?*
* *You like that?  You like that cock in that tight little pussy?*
* *God
* *Fuck girl
* *You're a bad little girl/bitch/slut.  You know what happens to bad little girls like you?*
* *Yeah
* *You like it when I fill up that hot wet little pussy?*

*Filthy/aggressive* - some girls want this the whole time

* *I'm gonna fuck that tight little cunt till you come all over my cock*
* *You like that you filthy fucking whore/cunt/bitch?*
* *I'm gonna blow
* *You dirty little bitch/whore/cunt
* *I'm gonna fuck you till you scream my fucking name*
* *I know you want that cum in you
* *That little pussy's gonna explode all over my cock*
* *You wanna feel it?  You wanna feel me cum in that pussy?*

...and so on...

**Well I guess I can give it a try... any final thoughts?**

Yeah,  calm voice.  Remember, you are a fucking sex superstar, your voice should ooze supreme confidence.

Second, and they like being dominated.  Making her repeat things back to you fires on both cylinders.

You: God

Her: *Yes!*

You: Wrong

Her: *I'm your dirty little bitch!*

You: Louder!

Her: *I'M YOUR DIRTY LITTLE BITCH!*

Seems I need a TL;DR here... Everything went very well. we talked, and she told me about an experience she had when she was young that made her take emotion out of sex. We had a great night of sex following, and im confident that things will get better. All in all it became a huge turning point for both of us, in terms of sex and communication. 




The long part:

First of all


This certainly isn't the end of our growth, and I wanted to give something to anyone who might find themselves in my position.


Last night was everything that I was scared it would be, embarrassing, and unsettling moment of my life. But it was also the most fulfilling, honest, open, comforting, and heartfelt discussion I think I've ever had with anyone. We already had plans to go to the bar to celebrate her new job, and drinks made things a little easier (for me atleast). My self-esteem was at an all time low going into it, that I felt like I was putting the blame on her. I did my best to not accuse her of anything, as it makes me feel wanted. That I feel like if I tell someone to do something


On a much more serious note, and just shuts her eyes and focuses on nothing but what it feels like. She told me that she thinks this is why she has such a difficult time reaching orgasm, and cried on my shoulder a bit. She told me that she does this because if she thinks about it, she can't help but to think about what happened to her when she was little, and it makes her have a nervous breakdown. She also explained that when she has sex, she doesn't feel anything when its slow. She said it ONLY feels good when its fast and hard. I asked her if she would be willing to work on not mentally checking out with me. I asked her to think about me, and look at me, instead of just think about sex. She said she would try.


After the bar, because now I'm falling asleep at work. But so totally worth it).


This is where a huge turning point for us (And me personally) came in. She initiated. She began sucking/licking on my ear and neck. Kissing down my chest, and tell her what I wanted her to do. Then... the most amazing thing, and the most awkward thing ever happened back-to-back. She had been sucking on me for a while, and she hit this spot with her tongue. She swirled her tongue around the head for a second, and then out of nowhere deep throated me. This immediately made me orgasm, but I didn't cum (Atleast I think I did. I've never experienced anything like it) My face and hands went numb, and my head started to spin. It felt like the most incredibly powerful orgasm that I've ever had, is that when she sensed that, and fingered her asking her what she liked. I found that the G-spot is definitely where its at with her


I guess it was a mixture of alcohol, and completely immersed in what we were doing. At one point, She seemed to check out like she says she does. I grabbed her hands, and put them on my chest, and told her to look at me. She opened her eyes, and looked me in the eyes for the first time since we've been seeing each other. It was an incredibly emotional experience for both of us, and she immediately seemed to get into it 100% more. She even went so far as to grab my hips, staring into my eyes and enjoying the way I looked and felt. I still didn't bring her to orgasm


This has been a very long winded response, although I doubt it. At very least, I see this being the beginning of a much more fulfilling sex life for both of us.


So I say again. You guys fucking rock. Thank you to everyone who replied, I'm ecstatic.

So his GF has been informed along with the other people I know of who have had missing undergarments.

Hi so I'm typing this quickly because I don't want anyone to walk in on this and see

I'm 16 and Indian

I've got some of the basics down pretty good, but she's going away to college next year (she's a senior). So, into it then:

- **Random sex and hookups:** I know that STD's are prolific, btw do you have an STD?"" I'm assuming condoms protect against a lot of this...

- **Birth control:** Can I get on the pill without my parents knowing? Next time I have a regular doctor's appointment, but I want to make sure I have my options in case I'm totally wrong. 

- **Condoms:** how do I know what size to buy? Should I buy a couple and keep different sizes? Is it a one size fits all sort of deal? I can see men getting insulted if I wip out a condom and it's too small

- **Masturbation:** right now I get off with a shower head or by fingering. I can't buy a sex toy

When I flicked it I sort of felt it in my butt, if that makes any sense. This is kind of gross.

- **Underwear:** How do I tell my mother/father that I want to wear cuter underwear? I haven't bought bras in ~2 years and I need new ones. All my panties are blood stained from my period and they're from the kids section or they're what you'd call ""granny panties"" You can see the panty lines through some pants. 

I hear someone coming

I cleaned up, ran to the bathroom and started frantically googling ""pee when sex"" on my phone.

1362583364.0,19s167,Ready to cheat on my wife. (X-post from /r/offmychest,FingersXed,1274,503,557,"Been married for 7 years, and for the fact that I still do care for and love my wife and have an otherwise live-able

My wife's sex drive is gone, on the other hand, is still very much alive and I've finally come to the place where I'm open to exploring the possibility of getting my sexual needs met extramaritally.
That pretty much sums it up. But the record-breaking mass of text below explains the details.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, and maybe I'll find some people who can understand the way I feel, who are or were in a similar place... And just maybe some twisted bastard somewhere in the world will tell me I'm not a terrible person.

So, although I've tried to make it enjoyable/ pleasurable for her. On the rare occasion we are in bed together, I try to spend time on foreplay, (although kissing is often forbidden because she's afraid either one of us might have a cold germ of some kind and might pass it on to the other--you can imagine that after oral, absolutely no kissing is aloud) I go down on her and try to give her pleasure so that it's not just about me (it also serves to lube her up since she has never had a very wet v, anyway) but she always ends up saying ""thank you, but that's enough"" and tells me politely to go ahead and get on with it. After which sex itself is often painful for her.

And she's not interested in trying to figure out what's wrong. Consulting a professional

So, fresh sheets on the bed, etc.) and often after I've stooped to hinting that it's been over three months and I'm starting to go a little crazy, only then will she come to me when she's ready, tell me she's sorry to have kept me waiting with a shy smile on her face and let me have sex with her body for as short a time as possible--while I pray that it's not painful for her this time.

How the hell did this happen? Our sex life was nothing like this when we were going out. What brought about this fucked up situation?
As you can imagine

I was a virgin till I was 25 due to a combination of hardcore christianity, high standards and perhaps most of all, lack of opportunity. So I had sex for the first time (if you can call it that) when I was 25, but my girlfriend at the time (who was also in her 20s) had an extremely small/tight v and I was inexperienced and didn't know anything, could only get the tip of my d inside her, didn't want to hurt her, was still in the throes of christianity, did it anyway

And then I moved to Japan. Eventually christianity started to fade, I didn't want to have sex with anyone I wasn't in a serious relationship with. I didn't want to lead anyone on, or break anyone's heart, either. But finally, at the end of my 3rd year in Japan, I managed to hook up with a girl I really liked.
As luck would have it, and she was not helpful at all when I had trouble staying firm (remember, this is like the first real borderline normal sex I'd ever had and I was like 29!). But anything was better than nothing at that point, and after all, this was a girl I'd liked for a while and was genuinely attracted to, so I was willing to put up with almost anything. Turns out she wasn't. She dumped me after 5 or 6 weeks citing cultural differences and broke my heart.

A month and a half later, thoughtful, and caring in general, but in bed, too! It was mindblowing. Whenever I had trouble keeping it up, she would switch to oral till I was ready to go again. She was happy to try different positions that were new to me. Sex was fun! And what's more, she came easily

I couldn't imagine finding someone who fit me better sexually, ultimately after about a year and a half of going out I decided to ask her to marry me.

But before actually getting married, was bitter about the paucity of sex in his marriage. This guy told me that once Japanese girls have kids, they totally switch their focus onto their kids and sex is no longer important to them. I thought that this was probably an unfounded generalization, based soley on his own experience, but I was concerned enough about it to talk to my then-fiancée, and she again assured me that she understood how important sex and physical intimacy was to me and that it was important to her, too

She changed a lot after we got married. She became fearful of many different things, cute, fun, outgoing girl I'd thought I'd married. But, I came to terms with it eventually, after crying like a baby and dying a little bit inside. I did my best to support her and care for her. I still do. Trying to ride the line between avoiding things that make her fearful or angry and letting her irrational and exaggerated fears overrun our lives completely. But perhaps my enthusiasm has waned over time, and I'm not always as fun and easy-going as I used to be. And again

Infants in Japan don't usually get their own rooms. In fact, too, so when our son was about 4 months old my wife and I decided that the best solution was for me to sleep in the guest bedroom with the dog. Over time I became very attached to having my own space and my own bed. She was understandably not in the mood for sex anyway, and I was free to take care of myself just about every night alone in my own bed. And now that we have our own house, we have separate bedrooms. She sleeps with our 5 year old son who hasn't learned to sleep on his own (not really unusual in Japan) and I really really need my own space, not to mention the privacy to be able to masturbate whenever I need to.

We tried for a second child for about 2 years after our son turned 2, chronic constipation and frequent abdominal pain) had exacerbated my wife's germ-phobia and emotional volatility, not to mention she was extremely stressed out about the OBGYN visits associated with infertility treatment.

While trying for number 2, sex faded out almost completely. I've tried talking to her about it. I've tried reminding her of what we had talked about before getting married. About how I need physical intimacy including sex. I've gotten angry about it a couple of times. And sometimes she's apologetic and promises to make it more of a priority, but it never pans out. She often gets up at 2 or 3am to put another load in the washer/dryer, that's how important the laundry is. But sex? 10-15 minutes of physical intimacy without sex even? Not important.

So, says good night, says how much she appreciates all my hard work for the family, then turns on the TV to watch a program she recorded earlier.

Now, and wow her with your testosterone. Neither approach holds any interest for me. I'm not a doormat, but I do my fair share already: cleaning the bathroom and shower, taking care of the dog, taking out the trash, spending time with my son, helping him get ready for preschool in the morning, helping with breakfast, but basically what I'm saying is that I do my part. And not like a begrudging asshole. I'm not always a happy prancing elf, since cleanliness is of the highest priority for her so spontaneous touching/kissing is out (did you brush your teeth?)

Don't get me wrong. Our relationship is often very pleasant. Usually, but I've learned to avoid a lot of the things that piss her off. And, there are times that I still get a glimpse of the wonderful person I decided to marry and start a family with. Sometimes more often than others, but still, it's something.

I've seen her at her worst and almost surprisingly I still find her attractive. And despite what I may have led you to believe, to be more cheerful, etc. I should add that she is usually a really good mom, as well.

So this may not be the marriage I signed up for

Except that I want sex badly and she doesn't want it at all.

But she also doesn't want me to have sex with anyone else. And that just strikes me as kind of ridiculous. Natural

So, I doubt I'll ever find someone I find attractive who would be happy with just some occasional clandestine sex that I wouldn't be worried about contracting an std from. It may be the most hypocritical thing in the world coming from someone talking about cheating on his wife, but I really don't want to hurt anybody. So, one thing I'm not going to do is lie about being married. I'm not gonna give anyone the false hope of a long-term relationship when like I said at the beginning, divorce is not an option for me.

There's always prostitution, anyway. So, yeah. Not an option.

So

1338640289.0,uh3hl,How I suck a new partner's cock for the first time (detailed description of techniques you can try with your partner),Maxxters,1127,359,290,"I’ve been asked quite a few times to detail how I go down on guys. That’s an incredibly hard question to answer though, so I make sure I add that in by the end, then get to his penis a lot faster. It’s all about paying close attention to how he responds as well as feeling comfortable enough to actually ask questions and talk about it. 

So you start off with your usual making out and stripping off of the clothes. Once you’re both good and naked, which should be pretty self-explanatory. So you move from his face, to his neck, to his chest, then you go back up to his neck before going back down to his chest then his nipples, then back up to his chest, etc etc. I honestly do this all over his body. I try to hit as many areas as possible. I also don’t totally stick with the same pattern, for example. Some really great spots to hit on most guys are their obliques (the sides of his abs and almost around to his back), so you may be surprised when you come to another part of his body and he starts to really moan. 

I keep doing this and come as close to his penis and balls as I can get without touching them and keep moving downward. Many men love it when you suck on their toes, coming incredibly close to his package but then go up past it. Eventually you start circling in towards his penis.  When I finally get there, I give a ridiculously slow, long lick with the flat part of my tongue (like licking an ice cream cone) all the way up from the base of his shaft to his coronal ridge (I’m avoiding the glans at this point). I alternate those with super quick, sharp flicks of my tongue all over his shaft. I’ll then lick my hand to get it really wet (his shaft is already pretty wet, as I don’t swallow any of my spit... I let it all come out on his penis) and I start stroking his penis as I move my mouth back to his balls. Here I’ll either pop them straight into my mouth, while I swirl my tongue around and over them while moaning or I’ll start by just licking the balls and swirling my tongue around them while they’re outside of my mouth before popping them in.  Some guys hate ball play and it can actually be painful for them, then start really tentatively with light licks before putting his balls in your mouth and pay attention to how he responds.

I use my hands a lot while giving head. It’s all about playing with the speed, make sure you use a gentle twisting motion with your wrist. Once you’re happy with the amount of ball play (which you return to throughout the blow job), then move your head back to his shaft. Slowly lick from the base up to the glans while looking him in the eye and smiling. Many guys absolutely love eye contact during oral and that evil, naughty grin in your eyes makes it that much more fun. Remember, you need to be enjoying this too! 

This is when I stick my tongue out and circle/swirl it around the glans (still making eye contact with my partner) while wrapping one hand around the base of his shaft. I then bring his glans into my mouth while I keep swirling my tongue around and around on it. I gradually move my mouth lower and lower down his shaft while still maintaining that tongue movement. You’ll eventually reach a point where your tongue won’t physically move that way anymore, I tend to stay there and just move my mouth up and down about an inch or so, starting slow and then building up pace. Then I very very slowly bring my mouth back up to the tip (where I tend to repeat everything I’ve said in this paragraph!). 

As I build momentum, definitely use lube that you enjoy the taste of. I tend to grasp his penis with one hand, attaching my thumb and forefinger to my lips so it feels like my mouth and hands are one unit as I slide down and up his shaft (still using the twisting motion with my hand). My other hand tends to reach down and play with his balls as well as putting pressure on his perineum (if your guy likes anal, then this is when you can pop a lubed-up finger in). Another thing I like to do is open my mouth and lips wide and try to make it down as far as I can on his shaft without really touching it. Once I’m all the way down, then I close my mouth/lips tightly around the shaft and pull up. I do that multiple times before surprising him with pursing my lips really tight and letting his glans enter my mouth like that, and go all the way down to the base of the shaft. At that point, I open my mouth really wide and pull right off him without him getting to feel it. I do that multiple times before allowing him to feel my lips staying tightly around him on the way down and up (and that’s when I return to the technique I discussed at the start of this paragraph). 

I also like to take breaks where I can sit up and just look at him and smile. While doing that, is super wet) and stroke him up and down with both hands stacked on top of one another (although, that depends on the length of the guy’s penis). I gently twist my hands in opposite directions.... just enough so he gets the stimulation, but not hard enough so there’s any risk of actually pulling the skin and hurting him. I’ll then use one hand to stroke him while the other hand goes over top of the glans and uses a similar wrist-motion to squeezing out the juice of an orange on those old-school juicers (lightly though!). I’ll also take my palm and press it gently down over top of the glans before lightly stroking upwards, drawing my hand up with my fingertips down, right until my fingertips leave the glans. However, this can be too intense for some guys.

 Keep in mind that whenever my mouth is on his penis, including returning to “ignoring” the penis and stimulating his other body parts before resuming the blow job. I tend to like edging guys, so once they’re about to orgasm, I back off and make the stimulation much less intense so they don’t end up cumming. I do that multiple times before finally allowing them to orgasm. Remember though- orgasm isn’t the goal here. The goal is to give him as much pleasurable stimulation as absolutely possible. Have fun with it, enjoy yourself and make sure that he reciprocates on you either in that session or in one soon after!

THROWAWAY TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT!

On Saturday we hosted a Halloween bash at my flat. I thought maybe I'd chat up a girl and get lucky as I've been going through a dry spell. I talked with a few girls

This girl walks in the room and makes a beeline for me. She's amazing looking. She's dressed as a zombie but you can see she has beautiful features, fit body. She approaches me and jabs me in the chest with her finger, ""Say good-bye to your kneecaps chucklehead!"". At first I have no idea what she's talking about due to being bowled over by her directness until I remember it's a reference to my costume (A Scout from TF2). We spend the rest of the evening chatting about videogames. She turns out to be really funny and bright. By the end of the evening the liquor is starting to take hold of me. While she's speaking I try to make a smooth move to hold her hand, but she doesn't respond. I try again when I'm interrupted by her friend asking to go home. She quickly gets up and tells me that she might stop by sometime (my room-mate is her friend) I say that would be nice and expect never to see her again.

Fast forward to last night. I'm on the couch watching some movies when I hear a knock at the door. I'm a bit peeved, at my door, with a big bottle of rum in her hand. She pokes me in the chest again and says ""Hey Scout!"". I'm about to run my mouth, thinking she's come to visit me, when my roomie pops up from downstairs and greets her at the door. Apparently they've arranged a sleepover. I spend most of the evening in my room, doing everything I can think of to get her off of my mind. Eventually curiosity gets the best of me and I venture downstairs. Huddled around the television are the rest of my roomies and the zombie girl playing what appears to be a Star Wars drinking game. I make like I'm going to the kitchen when one of my drunken roomies invites me to sit and play with them. How could I say no?

For the rest of the movie zombie girl makes no attempt to interact with me. No eye contact, saying she'll be right back, I assume to grab a smoke or hit the toilet. I go to pour myself another drink (rum and coke) when I fumble and the soda spills all over my hands and sleeves. My room-mates laugh and I make off swearing into the kitchen. When I get there I see zombie girl pulling a drink from the fridge. She looks at me concerned and asks what's wrong, I feel totally stupid and embarrassed and quickly make my way over to the sink. ""Oh you know, soda, all over myself."" With the same concern she makes her way over to me, ""No worries, as slow as possible. I'm shocked into silence and start to stiffen up. She reaches the end of my finger and gently strokes my index finger

She leaves me at the sink to return to the drinking game and I take a fe minutes to breathe and let my dick go soft again (believe me, no winks or sly smiles, keeps mostly to my roomie. I start to think that maybe it was all a dream, maybe I'm crazy, maybe finger sucking someone clean is perfectly normal to her for some reason and there was nothing sexual meant by it. 

By the end of Star Wars we've run out of rum and roomie suggests another run to the liquor store for more rum and more snacks. Being four of us (2 other roomies and zombie girl) my two room-mates decide to leave, as we're discussing our love of Scrabble she says, ""I know a great game to play"". The tone she says it in leads me to believe her next sentence is going to be ""Monopoly"" or ""Yahtzee"" but instead she quickly moves on top of me and presses herself against me so that her lips are grazing my ear.

""Let's play a game"" she whispers in my ear, ""Do you want to have a race?"". I must have nodded because she smiled but honestly it felt like I just laid there. She let's go of my hands and starts to quickly un-do my belt. A small part of me is worried about our additional room-mate in the basement, but I'm way too turned on to give a shit. She shuffles back so she's sitting on the edge of my knees and slides her hand underneath wrapping it around my dick. ""Let's see if we can make you come before our friend get's back? Ready? Set, go.""

She drops her legs between mine and flips my dick out of the top of my pants. She looks straight at me and starts to lick slowly up the shaft of my dick. When she gets to the top she envelops it in her mouth and slides all the way down very slowly, I didn't want it to end. I was hoping she'd change her mind about the race and I could take her upstairs, it was driving me crazy. The moaning got louder and I had to look away or else I'd come. I put my head back on the couch so I was looking up at the ceiling and pressed my fingers to pinch the bridge of my nose (don't ask, it helps). She immediately sat up and mounted me again, one hand stayed on my dick, pumping it, and the other one grabbed the hand on my face and pinned it down again. She pressed herself against my ear again and started to talking to me while pumping me, I want to taste you."" At this point I'm going nuts and figure I might as well if she wants it so bad.

Before she can move back down I hear the front door open and close

They roomies come back in and it goes right back to the way it was before. She sticks to her friend

I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (27) for two and a half years.  He’s the most considerate man I have ever met and we get along swimmingly.  He makes me laugh and I think he’s brilliant and I see myself spending the rest of my life with him.  Everything is pretty picture perfect.  Except for sex.  He has never really been able to go for very long before coming.  On average

The first year or so, it would last for about five minutes and then he would come.  I started to realize that we didn't have sex often because he was embarrassed of this.  The embarrassment kept us from having sex a week or two at a time.  After about a year, I finally said something to him (about how often we had sex) because I was starting to think it was because of me.  It was then that he admitted his embarrassment.

After we finally talked about it, and I go down on him.  And for the little time that it happens, it's great.  He hits the spot.

I find that a lot of people come into the store not really knowing what they're looking for, or what novelty items I would suggest. It's no mystery to you fine folks that everyone is different and not everyone's body reacts the same way to stimulation, but I think that a lot of people get nervous in the store or feel like they can't ask questions because it's ""weird"" or makes them uncomfortable.

So

NUMBER ONE! Do not feel like the people behind the counter are going to judge you. The reason I work in the store is because I am very, if you're not harming anyone or yourself, and you're being safe about what you do, then you have every right to do whatever floats your boat. The worst thing I will ever say to someone asking me advice is that I'm not familiar with it. If you want to know how comfortable a certain strap-on is, or aren't sure which vibrator you want, go ahead and say ""Hey, could you help me?""

""What's your best toy?"" This is the hardest question for me to answer without knowing what kind of stimulation you're after. If you want a good vibrator, Soft Vibes, Clitoral, Bullets, Rabbits, Anal, Glass, Dildos/Dongs, be it the wall-shaking power of the Magic Wand or a gently buzzing bullet, you'd make sure you really liked those jeans and you'd try them on before purchasing

Sometimes I get a customer that's looking for DVDs and doesn't know where to start. We have hundreds and hundreds of titles on hand, let me know and I'll walk you to the ""couples friendly"" section and tell you what I can about certain titles. Or if you want gay or bisexual porn and you can't find it, don't be afraid to ask! I don't really watch it, but I can tell you where to find the DVDs and even tell you which ones sell better than others. 

Lubricants. So many lubricants... I don't think I could ever sample every lubricant out there, and each brand varies from the next. If you don't know if a lubricant has glycerine in it or you don't know whether or not a particular silicone lubricant is going to be safe for your toys, pipe up! I'll find out for you. If you think Astro-Glide is gross and you're tired of using it but you don't know what you should try instead, I can make personal suggestions or I can hang out with you by the samples and try to guide you in the right direction.

It's really that simple. Just ask for some help! My store is very, just like any other customer service job. I wish more people would ask questions or speak up when they're not sure about something. I hate to think someone is going to go home and be dissatisfied with their purchase or be turned off to the idea of coming to the store. It's such an open and safe environment, and we want you to take advantage of that and be comfortable shopping with us. That's all, folks.

We started dating when right before high school

We both got out of school this summer. We’re both getting “real jobs” (done) and married (dated for Christmas

I’ve been thinking about this for a while, what sleeping next to *her* feels like, etc. That’s not true for her. Aside from having boyfriends before me, she also had a problem with cheating in our freshman year of college. 

I toughed it out. She really HAS changed

I know a lot of people might tell me to experiment or move on. I can’t deny that I want to know what other girls are like. Not just the sex. What is it like to fight with someone else? To comfort someone else? 

I’ve never felt, absolutely. About making her feel better and improving her life. About helping her through school. I was obsessed with that. But  I never felt butterflies or anything. Sometimes I would with other girls, and I fucking **ran** from anyone who made me feel something other than normal friendly affection. 

A lot of people probably won’t understand this, the idea of being away from her makes me sad or even nauseous.  

Okay. So she’s always telling me I need to get “fucking other girls” out of my system. I know she doesn’t really want me to sleep with someone else

And now I just… I don’t know. I love her, I know, but you can’t have everything.) 

Here’s where I started having a problem: I had to work on a project with a girl for a class right at the end of school. We had the kind of interactions that make me want to run away from someone. Butterflies
Anyway so when the project concluded and we got our A, puked. Then (sad I know) I cried. Like a little kid. I don’t know why. It just came out. Not like sad movie tears. Like full-body sobs. I wasn’t thinking about anything, it just *happened*.

And since then I’ve been wondering. Am I missing something? Is it ethical or normal or moral to want some momentary passionate sensation over a lifelong connection that goes beyond love? Am I kidding myself? 

I’ve been with this girl for 8 years

I’m just wondering. Am I missing something?

So establish boundaries, come up with a safe word (even if you don't think you need one...fantasies are one thing, actual enactment of them is another, you may not actually enjoy the reality of it once you experience it so it's always better to play safe than be sorry!), and please be respectful of these boundaries. These kinds of activity require a great deal of trust from your SO, please do not violate this trust.**

**Also, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Ask them if anything is wrong, MAKE SURE NOTHING IS WRONG. If you have any doubt in your mind, just stop. If he/she uses the safeword, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Give them a second to relax and decompress. Talk to them about it, get them to communicate what went wrong. Please, please DO NOT continue

**Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL AND GUY IS DIFFERENT, and I'm hoping SOME people will find it helpful/interesting. THIS WILL VARY FROM GIRL TO GIRL AND GUY TO GUY. So PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A GENERAL GUIDE FOR EVERYONE.**

Okay...for the last time

- **Sounds:** Moan

- **Beg for it.** Vocally: ""Oh *please*"" Him: ""Please *what?*"" You: ""Please, put your arms around his neck, press your body tight against his. When you feel his erection, glide your hand down the front of his pants and feel him through it, whisper in his ear: ""I want *this* so badly.""

- **Don't let him do all the work:** When he's on top, run it across his back/chest, through his hair (use light fingernails if he likes that sort of thing). 

- **Shy kisses:** I like doing this when my guy is being particularly rough with me. I'll give him gentle kisses, along his neck and collarbone. This feels amazing when he gets more aggressive, it's like the more gentle I try to be with him, the more he'll assert his dominance as if saying ""none of that bullshit, I call the shots."" So I'll try to kiss him gently, but he'll just grab the back of my head and turn it into an aggressive kiss. Incredibly hot. It's very hard to explain the mentality behind this one, but it's like the more rough he is with me

- **Let him dominate you while YOU are on top:** Me and my guy like to do a lot of different positions during sex. Often times, he'll make me please him by being on top. ""Ride me"", then he puts his arms behind his head and smirks up at me, while I do all the work. At this point, show him how desperate you are to please him. This is the time when I really like doing the ""shy"" kisses cause I can lean over him and kiss him gently on the lips/neck. 

- **Being disobedient...on purpose:** Sometimes it's no fun being the perfectly obedient little slave...how else am I going to get punished? ;) So often times I will disobey on purpose...I do this by: 

1) In BDSM play: Taking too long to obey an order, not refering to him appropriately (i.e. ""Master""). 

2) In ""rape"" play: Resisting - try to ""fight"" him off, I like protesting: ""No, please *no*"". ""I don't want to, please *stop.*"" Him: ""Do you think I care what you want? Now shut up, you're here to do what *I* want.""

- **Blowjobs:** Suck him off as if there is nothing else you would rather do. Moan while you have his cock buried in your mouth (yes this may be difficult - but is possible when you're just playing with the tip). Use your hands (assuming they are not tied up) and pull his waist to you as if you are desperate to get more of him into your mouth. Do what your guy likes in terms of body language - i.e. if he likes your eyes lowered, or if there's anything else you can do to please him.

- **Beg to please *him*:** ""Please, ""Please, will you cum in my mouth/face/chest/stomach/pussy/ass?"" 

- **Remind him that he controls your orgasms:** Again more begging. ""Please let/make me cum."" ""I need to cum so badly, show how desperate you are, rub your wetness against his cock or fingers, spread your legs wide for him.

- **Apologize when you're disobedient:** Beg for forgiveness ""I'm sorry master. I didn't mean to. I'll do whatever you want

- **Thank him:** Thank him for giving you pleasure/reward. And for letting *you* please *him* ""Thank you for letting me suck your cock."" ""Thank you for letting me swallow your cum.""

**After care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your partner after - make sure she/he is okay, kiss, hold, cuddle her/him, tell them you love them, etc, etc.**

Thanks ahead of time. 

I (20f) am an attractive girl, I can't ride a bike because it's too painful, I can't wear tight pants or underwear without it rubbing uncomfortably, I feel far too uncomfortable to wear a swimsuit in public because the outline is very visible and when I walk they have a tendency to ""slip out into the open"" Yikes. Sex is also made completely unpleasant by it. Of course it takes some manipulation to make room for a penis to enter, but then throughout they're constantly getting stretched and pulled inside, and I end up having to stop every ten seconds to readjust. I finally realized that it's just a wholly unpleasant experience for both parties, and so I've stopped having sex altogether.

But worse than the physical manifestations is the toll it takes on my confidence. The first guy to see it asked what was wrong with me, pictures, and blogs designed to make women more comfortable with their vulvas. There's nothing quite so painful as looking at the pictures with implications like ""even this girl can be confident"" or ""at least you're not this bad,""  because they're intended to represent the extremes of anatomy, and realizing mine are even worse. 

I keep telling myself it's not my fault, every guy who's seen it has apologized and admitted they're simply not attracted. At first I tried to tell myself they're all shallow assholes, and that If someone likes me for who I am, they won't mind. But I've realized that's not fair. If the first time I was intimate with someone I noticed something extreme about his penis that was completely unappealing and repulsive to me, I'd probably be unable to engage in any sort of sexual activity with that person. You can't help it if you're simply not physically attracted to something/someone. 

I've been with a lot of men. Everyone has said something about it, but usually it's followed by a failed attempt to deal with it and enjoy sex with me. All except a handful made sure it was a one time thing. Those who stuck it out for multiple occasions each finally admitted they simply were too turned off by my anatomy to continue. I've had one boyfriend, and I realized the only reason I was with him was because he put up with my anatomy and was still willing to touch me and have sex and whatnot. It was just so rare that I held onto him. He too finally admitted that he was truly unattracted to my vulva, but he wanted to make me happy so he just sucked it up and tried not to look too much.

Is this the best I can hope for? To find someone who is at least willing to suck it up despite being repulsed? And what are the chances that of the few men who can deal with it, but that might be my only chance to have sex with someone who actually enjoys it. Do I stop engaging in any sort of sexual activity? It's just so emotionally painful to hear the same thing it over and over. It's made me incredibly depressed and resigned to never being able to have a normal relationship and never feeling confident or sexy. I've thought about labiaplasty, but everyone has begged me not to do it. Surgery is a big deal, and not something I want to undergo if I don't have to. Plus, I assume my insurance won't cover it, and I don't have thousands of dollars to pay for it. I know it's a pretty hopeless situation, but any advice would be appreciated. I just don't know what to do

(Sorry I've just taken up your time with one sad, but there's no one in real life I'd feel comfortable talking about this with, and it's been bottled up for quite some time. Help me r/sex. You're my only hope.)



Edit: Sorry, and the comments I've gotten from men about them have been devastating to my confidence. I assume labiaplasty would not be covered by my insurance, and there's no way I can afford it if it isn't. It's causing me a ton of anxiety and depression, and I don't know what to do about it.

1357650871.0,166jl9,Your prostate and all the fun that can come from it...,Whisperer85,1086,367,307,"Once you discover anal pleasure as a man

I just want to take some time to talk about the prostate play since I don't think there is an issue finding more information on strap on play in our little r/pegging corner of reddit.

The first thing you need to realize is that the prostate is not just a magical pleasure button (there are exceptions) to most men. It takes some time finding what you do and do not like. The first task is actually finding it for yourself.

The easiest way to do this, rubbing it, squeezing it between atwo fingers. You will feel a hard to describe pressure deep inside you.

Now there seems to be some discussion as to what ""milking the prostate"" exactly means. The first one is a technique to produce a milky substance that looks like watery cum. This can be achieved by massaging the prostate itself like I described on top. Find out for yourself how you prefer this to be done as there are many ways to do so like I said a bit higher. The result will be the gradual discharge of actual semen without orgasm. In the end you will find yourself drained

The second way is to produce 'infinite precum'. To do this you focus on the little glands that lie a little deeper behind your prostate. These are responsible for producing precum. These constantly produce a low amount of precum but go in overdrive when you are aroused. High pressure in these are part of a possible trigger chain for orgasm. By applying pressure on these you can milk the precum through the prostate. The result is a stream of precum that theoretically can be continued indefinately, your urge to come will become increasinly insistant to the point you will come and there is no stopping it. This will take quite long, though, and your orgasme will be mindblowing, your cum very creamy since there is little liquid left to add to your semen.

I hope this helps some of you to discover these pleasures.

EDIT: Pain is NEVER a good thing when dealing with your prostate

Sorry for complaining at everyone again

Basically I was with my BF for about 10 years, he complained that sex isn't enjoyable for him anymore. That I'm too big for him to feel enough friction to enjoy it. 

Specifically that I'm too big near my cervix and that the only time he gets enjoyment is when he's hammering my cervix and I'm almost passing out from the pain.

On Sunday he confessed that his bitterness about this issue was spilling over into the rest of our relationship, he reassured me that he wasn't comparing me to his two ex-girlfriends (who in his words were better than me). We had sex. I asked him after, since he had cum twice, if it was any better. He said no, there was just one position that felt any good for him.

On Monday night I decided to try my best to spice things up. I got dressed up

We then went out for dinner. We came back, I also added in a new one where I was facing down but using a pillow to lift my pelvis, he didn't like it. I used a towel to wipe up any extra wetness on my part that might be making it less frictionable for him. 

After sex I asked didn't outright quiz him on my performance but I tried to gauge if it had been any better for him. Nope

Yesterday we had an argument, that I needed more time and affection from him. He told me he couldn't give me that because he was getting nothing in return for affection (i.e it wasn't leading to good sex) and he was getting frustrated. He recommended I go to a gynecologist or buy some tightening cream. I told him I didn't think there was much I could do about it bar surgery, that he seemed to love sex with me before, that maybe his problem was mental.

And it seems like it is. He obviously found the heroin brand of vaginas while we were broken up and now nothing else compares.

What am I supposed to do now? I feel like it's pointless to even try to make things better. And why am I the one who has to try so hard? I'm really upset because it seems like it's all my fault.

And how can this even be true at all that he feels no enjoyment from sex? I tested the strength of my pelvic floor

Sorry for the long wait for this update! This isn't my primary account and I got caught up with my studies over the past couple months.

So...the details:

We booked a hotel room, and then ended up in bed, fully clothed, making out and grinding against each other. I was still pretty nervous about the entire thing, and he sensed that. We stopped for a bit to talk about what I wanted to do, and if I was sure. I reassured him, saying that I was definitely ready, told me to turn around so he could unzip my skirt (and he took his sweet time...which was really fun...)

So after stripping, which wasn't unexpected, given the amount of sensory overload I was experiencing. 

We started off in missionary; we lubed up very liberally (there's an almost empty tube of KY in my underwear drawer) and tried insertion. IT HURT. And I bled, I got on top as well but it still hurt, so that didn't do much for me at the time. We varied leg positions while in missionary, which felt better as the pain lessened. It wasn't until I was on the edge of the bed and he was standing,holding my legs on his shoulders that it started to feel really intense, good intense. I loved how he felt when he was completely inside of me. The pain was fading and there was a pressure down there, it felt amazing. We fucked in that position for a while and we both got really into it, it was too intense and I was beginning to feel sore. I stroked him and told him that I wanted him to  cum on my stomach, I haven't had any UTI or STI issues

He and I haven't had sex since then, and making some plans to meet up in the future when he's back. Afterwards I did feel some pangs of longing for closeness and intimacy with someone, but funnily enough, it wasn't for my partner at all. I think it was general feeling of loneliness and knowing that, for me, sex would be a million times better with someone I love and who loves me back. But for now...DM;HS :)

I'm partly to blame. I was blessed/cursed with a large penis. Not a HUGE penis mind you, somehow damaged her vaginal wall which caused her to bleed profusely for 2 weeks, and I have also ""bottomed out"" which caused her to nearly throw up from the intense pain. These are just the things she has told me about, I'm sure there are more. I can assure you, none of these injuries have occurred due to extreme sex.

When we were dating she loved sex and actually wanted to have more of it than what I felt like. However, this sort of thing does get in the way of ""relations"" and has occasionally stopped any sexual activity if I say the wrong thing, such as ""I want to fuck you so bad"". Apparently that's a no-no. Last Christmas when we were dating I purchased her a vibrator, her first. I spent the next week apologizing for ""such an insulting present"" but she has used it more since then. Any additional toys or ideas of things to do on my part are shot down with extreme prejudice.

All this I could handle because I was still masturbating. I've jerked off since I was 13 and if there's one thing I knew how to solve it was getting rid of my horniness. However, jerk off, and it was fine. This is no longer allowed. 

Despite my best efforts to be discreet and despite the fact that she knew I jerked off I ended up on the losing end of an argument regarding my habits. She discovered this by scouring my browser history. We spent 3 or 4 days fighting before it was resolved. In the resolution I promised to not look/jerk off to porn anymore.

Flash forward to this week. We haven't had sex in two weeks (which was just a quicky before going to meet her parents for dinner) and before that it was a month. I ask, but I just can't look at anything (which will not work). She wanted to wait to see her lady-doctor again before having sex again. Her appointment isn't for another week or two.

First update: http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16rf2h/update_what_are_these_things_on_my_vagina/

Just to give you some lovely graphic details of what has happened 'down there' since my last post... The sores turned into what looked like mouth ulcers. They were white

I went back to the clinic today for my follow up appointment and to get my results. Everything came back negative from the clinic (herpes, chlamydia etc), and my herpes test from the doctors came back negative as well. Basically, neither the doctor or the two doctors who I saw at the clinic know what it was. It was suggested that they were cuts from some form of trauma which then got slightly infected, or they were a very strange side effect from me being so ill last week. 

It is slightly frustrating not knowing what they were. But I am incredibly relieved that they weren't herpes! I am going back again in a month to be checked again

Thanks for all your nice comments on my last posts as well :) And practice safe sex! All the time! Having things appear on your nether regions and not knowing what they are is quite terrifying.

Sex should feel as natural as drinking water. 

It should not require confidence. 

Sex should *happen

Ripening lips, ripening pupils, ripening state of being. Ripe and augmented and brimming. Your energy goes to your pumping heart, then to every external nerve, then to theirs, on fire. 

You bask, moan, laugh. 

It’s not about being “good in bed.” 

It’s about being happy. 

One should never worry if they’re doing it “correctly.” Sex is not *factual.* I don’t want your cookie-cutter sex, fool-proof fuck. I don’t want a show. I want you. Let your instincts, urges and whims define that. It’s enough. 

What do most girls like? Forget about it. Statistics are meaningless when there’s only one. Hello

Don’t worry about taking it too slow. We got time. We got infinite rhythms

Don’t worry about making me come. I’m here. Right where I want to be.

I am overwhelmed by wanting; you don’t have to convince me. I want you because I like you. So don’t put on a front. Don’t taint this. 

I’m frustrated--it’s just authenticity I want. 

It’s originality.

It’s passion. 

It’s joy. 

Don’t say that something I like is ugly. Don’t compare yourself to the rest. You will live and die with and within your experiences like everyone else. If someone thinks you are amazing

I don’t care if you accidentally slammed my head into the wall, if the delightful pressure of your wet lips on my anything made a silly sound. There is no right way and no wrong way.

“Good in bed

You’re good in my bed. I’m pleased you’re there. I feel it suits you. 

Shove your technique. Let your memory swallow it. Fuck me like you’d fuck me

This isn’t a test.

Over the past decade, a hookup of mine brought her ladyfriend over...turns out they only wanted to smoke my weed, and they quickly left. Third time, I had a GF who had been in relationships with other women. She was thinking of visiting an old hookup, but things fizzled out between us before it could happen.

Cut to now. My current girlfriend (also 27) brings up the idea. Her libido is through the roof. We do the deed at least twice a day. She's got a yoga-toned body and a bag of kinky tricks. On top of everything

In the following order, c) scared shitless from fucking up my relationship, regardless that my GF and I are going into this together.

The big night arrives. We all chill out to some wine and music for about an hour before my girlfriend makes the first move and kisses her friend. It was all but 10 minutes before all the clothes came flying off. Mind you, it had been nearly a decade since my girlfriend experimented with another woman, so she was THRILLED and all over her. 

And then I'm invited in. Over the course of six hours (three hours of sleep in between), one of them riding me while the other sat on my face...etc. The list goes on. We went two rounds before all going to sleep in our third's full-sized bed...then my girlfriend wakes both of us up and we have fun for another hour. There must've been around 20 orgasms between the three of us.

The next day, and my girlfriend and I are on our way. We're walking arm in arm, the entire time talking about how we couldn't believe what just happened, and already planning on doing it again at least once in the near-distant future.

It was pretty much the greatest night of my life---and honestly, caution exercised (protection was used and we frequently washed up in between sex acts), a rock-solid relationship with my girlfriend, and not to mention a shitload of patience on my end during the last decade---I felt entitled to share it :)

**OP TL;DR: GF and I hooked up with another couple and now she regrets it because she feels jealous after seeing me and the other woman enjoying one-another. What do?** 

First and foremost

As it turns out, the husband stuck it in her. This was news to me. This was also what jolted her back to reality and before he was all the way in caused her to freak out and stop. He did immediately, of course, and apparently she hadn't given him oral, just received it, so after that moment, she looked over and saw me and the wife going at it and everything hit her at once. 

She's not mad at them or at me, it sounds like the natural progression that I was probably moments from with his wife, and as none of us had ever discussed this before, an honest mistake. 

I explained that I was alright with the experience, but I'm perfectly alright with avoiding this sort of encounter in the future.

My girlfriend said that she doesn't want to be with another man, as I'm not sure how bringing another woman into the bedroom would progress.

After our talk/walk, watched True Blood, and then made love. Very passionate, lottttttts for foreplay, and I was even able to finish with a condom on (a rarity for me). 

Just wanted to provide you all with an update. Thanks again.

My wife and I have been married for almost 10 years now.  She is a very sensual person but also repressed at the same time. I’m extremely adventurous and perverted and I love it that way – I will literally try anything ONCE.  She appreciates it in me as well; I more than make up for her very conservative approach to sex.  I mean she loves sex but it’s always been very “normal” sex – nothing really adventurous or taboo when it comes to fantasies or fetishes. She's NEVER shown an interest in things taboo or slutty or skanky



Over the past year I’ve had to travel a lot for work, it amuses me.  The thing is though I know it turns her on!  She usually says things like “I’m going to kiss your penis and stroke it until you cum.” Pretty normal sexting, eh?   Anyway, I said something like “I’m going to throw you up against the wall and fuck your ass like I own you.”  To which she responds - and this is the WELL HOLY SHIT moment – “After you fuck me up the ass I’m going to sit on your face and shit all over you, then I’m going to piss in your mouth and cum all over you.”  



At first I was completely blown away in a fog of WTF and HELLS YEAH and WTF.  I asked her about it a few minutes later and she just said it sounded good.  She went on to say that the idea of pooping on me turned her on – a lot.  Then she asked if I would be down with that.  I said yes because I’m supposed to be the adventurous one, we were planning on doing it that night. 



Well



Fast forward to the NEXT DAY – Now it gets REALLY weird.  I told her I didn’t really like the smell, which was even stranger to me.  I agreed and she did it.  


Picture this – I’m sitting on her lap and she’s giving me a reach around as she’s shitting in the toilet.  She is moaning and sighing like we’re having crazy wild monkey sex and has one of the longest and loudest orgasms I’ve ever heard.  So that is her new favorite thing to do and we both found out she only one fetish – POOPING and giving hand jobs at the same time.  



Feel free to ask me anything



**TL:DR – My wife found out she has a poop fetish and has orgasms while pooping.**  



**UPDATE - I asked my wife what is so hot about handling my junk while she dumps. Her exact response - ""It's kinda like there's a dick in my ass and one in my hand.""  A Dick made of POO?
I guess she possibly wants to get spit roasted and have anal sex

1374940950.0,1j5xzq,Worst sex you ever had?,NotNakedATM,911,235,787,"Before I begin


I met this guy on OKCupid a couple of months ago and we dated for less than three weeks. Let's refer to him as Larry. So, but for some weird reason I like keeping my 'number' as low as possible. However, I was really horny after being single for a year and I figured, ""Hey, why not? *How bad could it be?*""


Larry often talked about how many girls he had been with before me, I specified that I would need non-latex Skyn condoms because I had a latex allergy. He assured me that he would buy them so I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of getting them myself. When we were getting down to business and I was getting myself warmed up (he had no concept of foreplay), he slipped on a condom and we got started. I immediately felt a burning sensation and began to get the chills while sweating. I was legitimately shivering and told him to stop. Instead of stopping, Larry would merely slow down and tell me to ""just relax."" I couldn't take anymore and made him stop.


After apologizing and thinking it was all my fault (from not having sex for a while and being ""too tight"" or whatever else could have been my doing)
&gt;""Hey

&gt;"".........""

&gt;""You know

&gt;""Oh. Uh. I couldn't find them.""

&gt;"".......they sell them EVERYWHERE. Any CVS or Walgreens would have them... so what brand did you buy anyway?""

&gt;""You know

&gt;""Those are latex. And they're free. Did you even GO to a STORE to look for the ones you said you'd get for me?""

&gt;""................no......... I just grabbed whatever was in the bowl at the guidance office


So not only did this kid lie when he promised to get the right condoms, hoping that he'd earn some points and maybe wouldn't fuck it up the next time we tried.


Even with the right condoms, he would ignore me, shove my knees behind my head, and fuck me like he had a plane to catch in 20 minutes. It was horrible. I tried making it better by switching to different positions, but doggie-style was even more mechanic and monotonous. I didn't feel a thing despite him ramming me like my naked ass owed him money. He would also finish in less than two minutes or lose his hard-on between changing positions, so I was starting to run out of ideas. I never flipped out or got bitchy with him because he would often experience some self-hatred when not being able to perform. Figured it'd be better not to make it worse.


I, ""God, this shit is bleak so far. Maybe his oral is really good and I just haven't experienced it yet?""

Noooooooooooope.

You ever see pigs at a feeding trough? That's what it looked like when I looked down at my lady bits during this act. And not only was Larry messy with no technique whatsoever


Anyway

**EDIT - 7/28

Answers to some frequently asked questions:


**Q.** *Why are you keeping count? ZOMG STOP SLUT SHAMING*

**A.** I wasn't try to slut-shame by saying that, my number is pretty low and I find a weird satisfaction in keeping it that way. I like knowing that I can rub one out and not necessarily ""need"" to fuck someone to get off, but BY NO MEANS am I passing judgement on those who fuck casually. To be honest, I wish I was comfortable with doing that myself, but I'm just... not. Just a personal thing lol

**Q.** *Why didn't you just provide your own condoms since you needed special ones?*

**A.** I had offered to do so, he was like, ""I'll make it perfect for you baby! Just tell me what you need."" I told him and he didn't follow through. That's why it sucked so much.

**Q.** *Why bother even giving him a second chance after he was such an asshole?*

**A.** I try to find the best in people, he still never listened to my needs in bed after that either (trying to mimic porn--not in the good way) even though I did everything he liked. He loved blowjobs because I actually PAID ATTENTION, but then I was never getting the pleasure I needed in return and it got old really fast. Turns out his impotence was a side-effect of the anti-depressants he was taking because he was so depressed after his ex. (I didn't learn about this until after we fucked and him being hung up on her and miserable was our real reason for breaking up.)

**Q.** *What in the fuck is a dominant tit?*

**A.** It's the one that feels better when fondled. Sorry for not making that totally clear

They invited us over a few days later and after a lot of wine and beating around the bush, and didn't seem shy at all. Both guys watched us making out and undressing each other on the couch and then after a while we moved to the bedroom. The guys watched a little longer and then one of them joined us. The guys took turns with us until we were all ready to start having intercourse, and then we each had sex with our usual partners while touching, kissing and otherwise enjoying everyone else. For the most part I think we did a good job of  letting ourselves just be in the moment, and not being too self-conscious. It was definitely mostly about the two girls (one girl or the other was the center of attention at all times). 

Although my partner and I had been nervous beforehand, and afraid that we wouldn't be able to handle seeing each other with other people--but we came away from the experience feeling proud of ourselves, liberated, and closer than ever. I was surprised by how selfless I felt in the moment; I loved feeling like we were contributing to the other girl's pleasure, and was happy to share my guy for that purpose. It didn't feel like a threat to our relationship at all. I found myself feeling good and curious but not jealous. All in all, after all that caution and worry, we feel like it wasn't as big a deal as we had made it beforehand. For us this was basically a 100% positive experience and super hot and fun. The novelty of it and the physical feelings were overwhelming

I would highly recommend this to anyone who might be fantasizing about it! We made a dream come true and it was awesome. As of now we are down to do it again. If you are going to do it, and be all right with communicating during the encounter to make sure that everyone is comfortable and happy. Other than that, try not to be too shy, and be yourself.

I am pretty submissive in the bedroom and when I first started exploring my sexuality, grab my hair, moan, breathe differently, talk dirty, etc. I was usually sopping wet by the time they finished, and then they would take some time to please me

My current boyfriend is different. He is the equivalent of a ""dead fish"" while receiving. In fact, I'm not asking him to put on a bad porn-star-esque show) and it's a good way to figure out what someone likes. My boyfriend closes his eyes and remains pretty expressionless for the whole thing, doesn't like when I look up at him, and very rarely touches me.

To make matters worse, but my boyfriend only lasts about 5-7 minutes tops during P in V. During oral, it's closer to 25-30 minutes of expressionless dead-fish syndrome, in which he refuses to give me feedback, insists that it feels really good, yet asks me to stop every once in a while because he's getting desensitized. Towards the end, I can feel his dick swell up, but until then

Before you say ""communicate, but to be honest, I just can't anymore. He does not try to help me get off after he does (actually, after a few talks, he has started offering, but it is always very grudging, often accompanied by a heavy sigh) and he has such a long refractory period/low sex drive that a bj today means no sex for the whole day at least

I have a very high sex drive; I want sex every day, for no attention in return.

I know this isn't our only sex issue, but if I'm horny, I want action.

Then, he took his wet, saliva-covered penis

I see threads in /r/sex a lot where guys say they wouldn't date someone who wasn't giving them a lot of oral

So! I talked to him about how I wasn't sure if I would be into it, which gave me a ton of relief. So we didn't get to it for a while until he gave me a present about 2 weeks ago. He bought me a gorgeous bra which I was so thrilled about, but he also bought one for himself. So the other day I ask if I can give him a makeover (I love putting makeup on people and I thought it would be a good way to wade into the role reversal thing so I can see what it's like) and he's thrilled. So I bring my kit over, and I do his makeup, he likes it and we move to the bedroom. 

He puts on some fishnets that I gave him and the aforementioned bra and we go at it. I notice that his moans are more feminine and he's moving his body in a way similar to mine when we have sex. I am not into it AT ALL. I love seeing him release and give over to pleasure when I peg him, ""no, it's yours! I'm not gonna take it silly."" and he pretty much tells me he doesn't want it. I think that he noticed that I wasn't into it and is trying to make me feel better, but then he tells me that he thinks the kink was to fill some sort of void that he had before he met me. He was single for a while before we met and he tells me that I am so feminine and awesome that he feels like he doesn't need/want to cross-dress anymore. This whole time I'm really happy, but at the same time worried that he's compromising for me. He keeps reassuring me that he would tell me if he was.

1346738695.0,zbnsn,PSA: How to have great sex in a marriage/long term relationship.,Syncblock,923,283,138,"Sexxit

I've been married with kids for 15 years

First up,  emotionally or sexually.

As a side not, most issues can be resolved.

Secondly, you're going to have less time for yourself much less together. Having sex in a marriage is all about good time management and finding time together. Even simple things like setting aside a 'date night' where you can go and just spend non-sexual time together or waking up that hour early to get a quickie in before work. Don't come home after a long day and expect sex, especially if your partner is the one staying at home and watching your children. It's not like they haven't had shit to do either. Both my partner and I work 60-70 hour weeks in high pressure environments and while that doesn't mean sex every couple of days or even every week, the relationship is incredibly strong. You just have to learn to work around your time and energy constraints.

As another side note, not just on your sex life.

Finally

A long term relationship can't and shouldn't be based on just sex. Once you've worked that out

Having great sex in a marriage with kids isn't easy but it's something you need to be proactive about and it's definitely doable.

***Edit:*** took out the bit about the other poster as I'm not trying to 'correct' him or save his marriage or whatever but I do wish him all the best. All I'm trying to say is great sex is possible in a marriage with kids but it involves a lot of communication

I've had some PMs so I'm going to generalise some of the responses here.

About specific actions you could do as a married partner with kids and I'd suggest having a 'date night' where you drop the kids and focus on your partner (even if it simply means moving the tv to their room

I'd also recommend you talk openly on a yearly or half yearly basis with your partner not just about sex but about everything in the relationship as well. A common example used is to think of a marriage like a business where both of you are the owners. It's not enough just to do your share and then sit back and complain about how your marriage is failing because your partner sucks. If they're not pulling their weight then it's your responsibility to pick up the slack.

There's no point in holding grudges or trying to find ways to hurt your partner especially if you have kids.

Posted this in r/askwomen


I'm a 19 year old female and I have this problem--the female version of death grip masturbation. I started masturbating at a rather young age--7 or 8--and have done it in a certain way ever since. I cross my legs and sort of squeeze my thighs together until I orgasm--usually doesn't take me more than 5 minutes.


This does lead to wonderful orgasms so I'm not complaining, or from manual stimulation. And yes, I know a lot of women can't orgasm from sex alone so we do incorporate clit play but I need so much pressure that it becomes impossible and tiring for both of us.


My SO is away this entire month so I want to try and solve this problem. I know I'm going to have to stop masturbating the way I do. I've tried before but it's really hard not to get impatient/frustrated so I just end up giving up and going back to my old ways.

1344518149.0,xxr6g,*Update* I stopped viewing porn (again) two weeks ago to see how it effected my libido and sex life for a total of 3 weeks *Results*,,962,341,359,"I'll preface this by saying I have no problem with porn or masturbation. I think they're both healthy aspects of a healthy sex life. My only reason for doing this experiment was out of curiosity. I wanted to see how my consumption of porn effects my libido, keep in mind that the results I'm posting are my own. I don't claim that what I felt throughout this will apply to anyone else

I'll be doing this according to the scientific method.


**Question:** What effects does the consumption of pornography have on my libido, and day to day life?


**Research:** [Research Indicates](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/x7khw/update_i_stopped_viewing_porn_a_week_ago_to_see/) that people who previously consumed porn and have abstained experience the following:

 * Moderate to extreme frustration ( ""putting an angry cat in a bag"" )
 * Increased Aggression
 * Mood Swings
 * Sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality
 * Drop in libido
 * Higher stamina during sex
 * More fulfilling and easier to achieve orgasm
 * More energy


**Hypothesis:** I hypothesize a personal increase in frustration, and I expect to see changes in my sex life. However, I will be testing the above mentioned claims as well.


**Testing**
The criteria for the experiment are simple, so clicked links in threads do indeed bring me to nudes once in a while. When this happens I just back out as fast as I can and don't linger. So yes, I did actually see some nudes during the course of the experiment, but not on purpose and not to sexually gratify myself.

An unfortunate consequence of this is that I don't really masturbate without porn. I'm 25, but now that I'm in my 20's I can't really do it without some kind of excitement or visual stimuli. So, basically I haven't been masturbating throughout the experiment. This is offset, however, by the fact that I'm married and very much sexually active with my wife.

**Analysis and conclusions:**

I started a sort of journal to document this

Days 1-2: Sex drive was bombed these two days after a discussion with my wife relating to the effects of last weeks 'porn fasting'. Without going into details, but I can tell the concept that I crave seeing other women naked bothers her. I feel awful, so my sex drive is awful in relation.

I also want to note that I somewhat consider last week somewhat applies to the current experiment

Days 3-4: Frustration starting to creep in. Olympics doesn't help with all of the ass hanging out. Revealing clothing is much harder to not glimpse. Damn you women's diving

 * Moderate frustration **Confirmed**
 * Sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality **Confirmed**

Day 5: Today I think it's really plateaued. I have the urge to look up pics or videos fairly often

 * Near extreme frustration **Confirmed**
 * Change in sex life **Confirmed**
 * Easier to Achieve Orgasm **Confirmed**

 * Increased Stamina **Debunked**

Day 6: What is this sport? Water Polo or something? It's like soccer or hockey in the water

 * Extreme Frustration **Definitely Confirmed**

Day 7: Very confused by my addiction to novel nudity. I feel like I shouldn't crave it like I do, although I guess that's irrelevant because it makes her feel bad and that's all that's important. I'll note that this is something that she is wanting to get past, and she has actually made a lot of progress in self-esteem. It's unwanted tension though, and it makes me really not want to discuss it with her any more. On the upside, the wife's libido has been up the past couple days and we've been active daily! This is awesome and helps a ton.

Day 8: The weekends are brutal. Wife has been working all day, but the wife definitely changed that. I'm not sure why I crave porn during the day but not sex.

 * Loss of libido **Plausible**

Day 9: I'm wondering that if this 'addiction' is not common amongst men and women (which I actually expect that it is common)

Libido is back today in full force.

This sucks. I've been thinking about quitting the last couple days.

Day 10: Nothing all that new. Still thinking of quitting. I might just start grouping days together unless something eventful happens. I'm not an aggressive or moody person to begin with

 * Increased Aggression **Debunked**
 * Mood Swings **Debunked**

Day 11: Last night kind of sucked. I was in the mood and tried to get something started (didn't progress because my wife wanted to shower first) but we fell asleep on the couch. Normally this wouldn't bother me

One nice thing is that my wife is indeed amazing and she texted me first thing this morning to say she was sorry because of the night before. Apparently I have a great blow job to look forward to tonight :)

Day 12: I feel good today. I got my gift from last night, so I'm not positive last night was attributed to the experiment. It's more likely that my wifes performance is what triggers these, but I'll go ahead and say it's plausible.

Oh.. and the baby only woke up once last night

 * Change in Sex Life: Improved **Plausible**

Day 13: Was a bit frustrated last night because of Olympic beach volleyball


**Results:**

 * Moderate frustration **Confirmed**

 * Sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality **Confirmed**

 * Near extreme frustration **Confirmed**

 * Change in sex life **Confirmed**

 * Easier to Achieve Orgasm **Confirmed**

 * Extreme Frustration **Definitely Confirmed**


 * Increased Stamina **Debunked**
 * Increased Aggression **Debunked**
 * Mood Swings **Debunked**


 * Loss of libido **Plausible**
 * Change in Sex Life: Improved **Plausible**

So there you have it. It was frustrating, porn is healthy and keeps me happier day to day because it helps suppress my primal urges.

One more thing I'll note is the last couple days were a bit easier

My SO (now-ex) and I are pretty baked in the living room, she turns to me and gives me ""the look"". She takes off her glasses, setting them on the counter within arms reach. We start making out and I pull off her hoodie and toss it onto the floor next to the couch. She unbuttons my pants and pulls them down to my knees. She starts going down on me. (It's awesome). Then, she jumps on top of me and we start going at it. At this point, I'm fucking psyched. I have never really done anything like this before and having her take control was pretty sexy. So we're still going at it when the stand-up we were watching on Netflix ends. Still very focused on the situation, I click the next closest thing and go back to it. A few minutes later, I hear a knock on the door. (We have a secret knock for those who live in the apartment.) It's the secret knock. I know it's one of my housemates. My SO hops off, ""What do I do? Do I open the door?"" She says yes, and I have a look of determination on my face. I say nothing but ""Hey"" and walk downstairs. My SO and I finish up and I walk back upstairs a little while later. 

Now here is where it gets good. I walk up to see a crime scene. No joke. The entire living room is blocked off by caution tape, her hoodie, the projector on which we were watching the shows, and a mysterious spot on the couch (fuck). I look over to my roommates and they are wearing fucking flu masks, head and shoe coverings. They look like a CSI team. They are standing around stone-faced, taking pictures, like it's a real crime scene. They look at me and point to the projector. What's playing? DOGS. A DOCUMENTARY ON DOGS.

1301900794.0,gi5nv,Blow job tips from a girl that has made several men cum from BJs who said they couldn't.,,978,382,202,"I originally posted this as a comment in a post...but then was asked to make into an actual post. I waited a while

Here are my tips (not in order):

1. Inhale it if you love it. Love that cock and show it. In other words

2. Learn about his cock. Every single cock has different thresholds for pleasure and pain. I've experienced extremes from men that are so sensitive I couldn't even touch their balls

3. For long pleasurable blow jobs mix it up. Example: Suck slowly for a while and take in as much as you can and hold it at the back of your throat (or however far back you can) and then go back to sucking just the head. Vary the speed, touching under them etc etc...

4. Lips wrapped over the teeth is less tiring (you don't have to open your jaw as much to avoid teeth getting in the way) and gives the guy more pressure when sucking.

5. Lots and lots of saliva. If you don't produce enough

6. If you have a gag reflex

7. Keep exploring/experimenting if you don't know what he likes. If your man is comfortable with your fingers behind his balls

8. If his cock is curved

9. Combo of hands and mouth = great blowjob. You don't need to just use your mouth and that's it.

10. Says he can't cum from a blowjob? That usually means he needs a woman with lots of practice in the stamina department

11. Some men need to face fuck in order to cum. That doesn't mean it has to be all the way down your throat. Sometimes all that means is just the head going in and out. You can actually use your tongue to make him stop going further than you want to and that gives him the feeling that he's bottomed out anyways!

12. Want to swallow for him but don't think you can? It's easier to swallow it when you can't taste it. So take him in as much as you can (which I know sounds counter intuitive) and you will feel warm stuff at the back of your throat, he should respect that you don't feel comfortable swallowing

13. Have fun with both blow jobs that are empowering (where you have control etc) and blow jobs that are sometimes seen as degrading. It's just sex and play. He doesn't view you as less of an equal just because he wants to cum on your face. He's just letting his animalistic side out.

14. Dirty talk and the eyes!! Give your mouth a break

15. Maybe this should be number one...but tease him. Don't just put your mouth on his cock straight away. Kiss around it

16. Surprise. It's fun to do the same thing for a long time

17. For guys whose cock isn't too sensitive and can handle this: after he [cums]

*Edit: Added tip #17 from El Dude with my own precaution.* 

**Edit #2: Some guys just DON'T EVER cum from a blowjob. Cumming from a blowjob IS NOT always the point of the blowjob!!! I just said that in the title to show that I'm not some random girl

I learned about this technique when I was dating a girl and couldn't last a minute with her. Too much physical and emotional attraction. I tried everything but to no avail. I even bought some weird mint gel that was supposed to numb the feeling but it left me literally without any feeling and was horrible.

After some months there was absolutely no improvement and it was beginning to be an issue for her. While I was at one of my dad's grill parties one of his friends (a specialist in gynecologic oncology) asked me if I'm having ""girl trouble"". To my surprise in my desperation I was completely sincere and told him about it. Told him I tried the most known stuff but it just didn't help. This was his advice.

He held trying to trick your brain with thinking about something else for very wrong as it degraded the act of sex. (a more extended version mixed with some of the experience I have now)

You have to be 100% concentrated to be able to enjoy, training will make you whatever you want to be. Have as much sex as you can. Don't fight your libido, use it. If you finish way too early - forget about it and start again in 15 minutes. And again. And again. As long as she doesn't mind and helps you get hard again, stay on it.

Best way to learn control is trying to interrupt your orgasm building in the last possible moment. The more you do it the more you will extend (control) it and will be able to enjoy that building up longer. Right before an orgasm the penis also becomes harder and if you could hold that over longer periods you're going to unleash your potential. Interrupting sex all the time doesn't seem good but you can do it in a sexy way. Be creative you can interrupt to change a pose. You don't need to hide it - you could pull out and rumble in pleasure

You can practice the thumb technique while masturbating. Masturbate and just before ejaculation push the tip around the urethral orifice down

I am glad I was told this technique at the time because I was able to not only have normal length sex but also get her to orgasm. Everything in just a couple of months. It was some of the most amazing exciting sex I've ever had!

Lately, to just go for it. Instead, she will do something like rub on my arm and not say a word. It's very passive and annoying.

She sees it as me pushing her. I've always been supportive of her. I've never said to her that she's overweight

First
I rent a house with five other roommates, let's call her Alice, has been living with us for about six months. She's funny, gorgeous, nerdy, and of course, already taken.

This evening I'm going about my usual routine, I'm brushing my teeth in my pyjamas which consist of a t-shirt and some hilariously patterned boxer-briefs. While brushing away I hear the door downstairs open and close. No problem, I think to myself, I'll just wait until they've passed into their room and jump into mine. A few moments later I hear a small knock on the door and Alice saying, ""Hello?"". I say that I'll be just a minute, and start having a mini freakout, trying to figure out how I may get back to my room without her seeing me in my underpants. Luckily I didn't have much time to ponder that because the door started to open and Alice slid in. 
Toothbrush in mouth I start waving my hands, I think as she looks me dead in the eye. She enters smiling and it makes me embarrassed and flushed, blood rushes to my cheeks, and sadly, being of the lesser gender, my cock as well. All of this, the door opening, the smiling

Let me interject for a moment to point out that Alice has NEVER shown even the slightest interest in me. She's nice

Anyway, cowering against the sink, mouth covered in toothpaste, cock desperately trying to escape my underpants, then steps forward and gingerly presses a cupped hand around my cock. The pressure gives it a bit of a jump. She slowly presses her entire body against me, I feel her breasts give against my chest and almost choke on my toothbrush. Her other hand starts to crawl up my spine like a spider and finally some to a rest at my neck, where she's grabbed a handful of hair and is holding on tight. She pulls my head down towards her and presses her lips into my ear

In a classier, ""Is that all you can do?"". Instead, dear reader, I gave more of a small high pitched mouse squeak and a bit of a jump as well. She starts to kiss the small of my neck while I snap back to reality and start trying to remove the toothbrush from my mouth while frothing, ""Boyfriend! Boyfriend, you have a boyfriend!"". Eventually my toothpaste accented message is understood and she leans back, hand still on my cock and gives me the most wonderful smile, didn't you know that?"".

Again, ""Are your legs open as well?"", but alas, as a mere mortal all I could muster was a long high pitched ""Hmmmmm?!"" accompanied with a slack jawed stare. 

Before I could figure out how I felt about the situation, then prances out the door, on her merry way, leaving me with a stone statue in my pants in place of a cock.

Allow me to preface this by saying this is a throwaway account.

How do I even start...

I'm a married man.  Been married for 11 years.  Typical story in regards to sex.  In the beginning, it is borderline insane.  As the years have progressed, it has only grown in intensity to the point where I am now degenerating because of it.  Degenerating how?  Depression, lack of sleep, constant state of arousal, unhealthy amounts of masturbation.  I try my hardest to avoid women, all women, but paying someone for the explicit purpose of being available to me at all points of the day for sex.

Have I told my wife this?  God no.

I have told her that my needs are not anywhere close to being met.  She has known for years now that the frequency of sex in our relationship will never be enough.  I regret every bringing it up, store, hospital, outside.  Most of all, I don't want to hurt her any more than I have by making her feel inadequate... the fact that she will never be enough has to be soul crushing as-is.  For her to know that if it weren't for our kids being here I would probably rape her on the hour, perhaps more, would seal her departure from my life and I cannot let that happen.

This is not an exaggeration.  To give another indication of the severity of my problem; I masturbate after sex.  Not once, I touch her and masturbate.

Don't confuse my earlier statements for me saying that I want to fuck all women.  I want my wife more than any person on this planet

I've been to a behavioral health specialist, meditation, masturbation, other forms of non-sexual treatment but nothing is stopping this urge.  So why reddit?  There are a large number of people here.  Maybe, if I'm lucky, someone will have personal experience with this and can offer some kind of help.

After she left, mutual decision that we needed a new rule stating that future partners would be people we'd never met before.  Second, we realized just how damn good we are together.

So here's some advice from a recent squirter initiate for those of you looking to open the floodgates. ",Genital_Cuff,794,214,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1akwlt/got_a_lot_of_pms_asking_for_tips_on_how_to_squirt/
I genuinely believe that all women are capable of this given the right stimuli and their ability to relax - and the sensation is so wonderful I can't help but want share with you to help you guys achieve it too! So good luck to you and yours in your sexy endeavors and let me know how it goes! 

**How it happens for me:** 
So far, towards my belly button. (we either do this with me on my back, legs slightly apart, or on my stomach, legs also slightly apart but thighs still touching).  

**What your partner can do/what you're feeling around for:** 
He says he can feel a spongey, and that's what he massages.
The motions he uses are not gentle, instead they should be using their whole hand in an upward motion, while their fingers are still 'hooked' at your G-spot. 

**What you can do:**
The main thing I'd say is that it won't happen unless you relax your muscles and even push outwards a bit
You'll know it's working because it will start to sound squishy
When you start to hear that noise, the 'need to pee sensation' results in an overwhelming feeling like I need to push outwards (it's involuntary) and that's when the orgasm comes and the gushing begins. 

**What it feels like:** 
It's the most incredible feeling in the world, totally out of my control.....and that's when the gushing happens. If you're like me, it's like fucking old faithful - you'll feel a lot of warmth and wetness and splashing....(The force/expulsion/amount I assume varies from person to person) BUT it doesn't end with the squirting! When I have these orgasms, after I've gushed, they continue - My whole body goes into contractions for minutes after it has happened - minutes!
It's ridiculous and it takes me a while to recover from it - I'm actually not able to walk for a bit afterwards. My legs turn into jello. 

**Some tips for your partner:**
The main thing I would say is that a lot depends on your partner hitting the right spot
http://www.redtube.com//15878 http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=212403928

**As for what YOU can do
First and foremost, push out when you feel the urge (My guy says that when this happens it feels like my vagina is actually pushing his fingers out of me). Don't tense up or get freaked at the need to pee feeling - pee beforehand if it makes you feel better. 
I think lube really helps it along as well, or the squirt is very very light. (You'll also need to drink a lot of water after it happens - you're going to lose A LOT of fluid) 

**If you're still trying:** 
Don't be discouraged if it doesn't happen the first, and it took quite a few times to get me to that point (now he can make me squirt in 60 seconds flat - over and over)

**Just a word of warning:**
The last thing I would tell you is that once it happens (and I really think every woman is capable), put down LOTS of towels. 
I'm still shocked every time it happens (after I've recovered and look down at the bed and see a freaking lake of liquid)

**But seriously though
I'm really no expert, mind altering, body-spasm inducing, continue long after you've actually squirted, and turn your legs to mush. 

**TL;DR:**
1. Drink lots of water/use lube/buy some towels 
2. Find a position and technique that allows the stimulation of your G-spot in that magical way (hook upwards with two fingers and use the whole hand
3. RELAX RELAX RELAX and go with it (push outward if this helps)
4. Funny squishy noise 
5. ""Holy god oh my god oh my god holy shit nothing has ever felt so good please don't stop"" 
5. ""What the hell just happened? Did a goddamn pipe burst over the bed?""
6. Be warned that if it happens that it might be really messy and require some clean up/and open-minded parter who isn't fussed by lots of lady-liquids. ",self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1akwlt/got_a_lot_of_pms_asking_for_tips_on_how_to_squirt/

She stopped texting back for about 20 minutes, breathing through her mouth. She rushed at me without saying a word, locking lips with mine, and pushed me against the side wall. I flipped sides and pinned her against the wall with my entire body. She ran her hands over my erection, but I pinned them above her head and told her not to move, ""or else"". I teased for a little; releasing my lips from the embrace and watching her squirm against my body, still pinned against her body. I didn't let up, slowly nibbling away to the beat of her whimpering sounds, it's 15 minutes of punishment. Got it?"". She nodded, until I was done mapping every inch of her back with my tongue. I took off her panties

She was begging me to fuck her, and said: ""If you move these, we're going to repeat what I just did"". She half nodded, half mumbled something, as I went back down the length of her stomach. Kissing, slowly, every inch of her stomach and navel. I got to her pussy and lightly kissed her clit. She gasped loudly and looked up at me. ""I told you not to move around... I guess it's back to the wall"". She said, please... I can't wait anymore"". *Then tell me what you want.* ""I want you to fuck me... Please"". *Say it louder. I want the neighbors to hear you scream.* ""I want-"". *Louder.* **""JUST FUCK ME!""** 

At this point, slowly at first, building up a rhythm. She started convulsing barely 20 seconds in, and came while I was still fucking her in and out. I stroked faster and faster, and she came again simultaneously. I didn't let up at this point. I kept fucking her. Fucking her until she was shaking for straight 5 minutes. I came right there inside her, and she let out another loud moan before passing out. I laid on top of her until she woke up while I was still inside her. I got hard again and fucked her until we both came again at the same time. She started mumbling incoherently for 10-15 minutes after that, crying/laughing at the same time. A couple hours later, waited a couple minutes, why? I replied

So my boyfriend is a (Type 1) diabetic who likes to keep pretty tight control of his blood sugars
So we’re in bed asleep, become bored and notice that my boyfriend has rolled over onto his back and since this is unusual for him and gives me easy access, and since I’m pretty bored and can’t get back to sleep, I decide to play with him while he’s asleep (which we have decided in the past is totally not rape).  

I get some response, except now he’s gone totally limp. I decided that it would be good if there was an explanation or this which didn’t involve the admission that I give crap head, and then remembered that one of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia is being unable to get/maintain an erection (or so the boyfriend has informed me in the past). 
So I wake him up and tell him I had a dream that his sugars were low

Turns out he’s like 2.1* (which is quite low

Of course, what if I hadn’t happened to wake up, or what if I’d managed to get back to sleep, or not been in the mood to give him a blowjob etc. On the other hand, I’ve finally got material worthy of making my first ever post to Reddit, and really that’s all that matters at the end of the day. Well, that and eliminating Katie Waissel from The X-Factor.

*I'm in Ireland

**Edit:** Yes

**Edit 2**: The reason I told him I had had a dream that he was low rather than the truth (which I told him once he was back to normal) was because he can be really stubborn about being made to check his blood and I didn't want to have to explain the whole story to him in his befuddled state.

We've been together about five months now with my girlfriend

Today I thought I was not in the mood any more after going for it twice already earlier, I noticed my boxers getting tighter and tighter... After a while she moves lower and uses her magic mouth to get me so hard I swear I could cut diamonds with my penis. 

I just couldn't wait longer, but this time it was even louder than usual. At some point she makes a weird sound which somehow resembled a horse neighing, which was incredibly funny, but I kept going and soon finished with the power of thousand suns. As soon  as I had finished I remembered the sound and couldn't help but laugh, so she asked what it was about. This was when my still ecstatic after-orgasm mind decided that it's a good idea to tell her she sounded like a horse...

Her immediate reflex was to slap me in the face few times (not very hard

I'm the kind of guy who never wants to hurt anybody's feelings, but I was relieved to see her coming out after a while and in few minutes we were laughing our asses off for the whole incident.

The fact that there are roughly eighteen million different flavours of porn on the internet means that **1)** people's sexual tastes vary wildly, if you don't like what you're jerking off to, jerk off to something else. 

There's no need to come on the internet and act superior because you only like amateur italian femme dom that only uses faux leather spanking tools. Human sexuality is great because it's so diverse. Some people like blowjob porn, that's fine. In fact, it's better than fine.

I've got to clean my house and do a bit of work now but I will reply to as many of you as I can later. I hope some of your will be happy to know that today BF e-mailed me while at work to say that he loved me, he really wants to try to make this work and tonight he's gonna sex me good. Using your tips I hope we both enjoy it and it brings us closer together.

Firstly

Secondly

Thirdly

Summary of events prior to last night: After a couple of months of noticing that sex was drying up in my relationship and that BF was treating me like a human flesh light during sex I confronted BF to find out the problem. He told me that sex with me was not enjoyable because he could not feel any friction during penetration. He said sex with me was bad; sex with other vaginas was much better. He said his penis needed small girls

After that conversation we went out to buy some bread, and finally found one where he could cum. We cuddled. I asked him if that was better for him. He said ''I liked that last position.. but um, no.''

The next day I dressed up, cycle through positions and wait for him cum. I asked how it was, I didn't get much of a response.

The next day came the argument and the reddit post.

Then last night happened. He came home and kissed me hello

I laid it out for him, it should be obvious that you're doing it too much. BF didn't agree, we argued a little ''I don't do it every day, you're twisting things!'' Me: ''Okay, you do it six times a week then.'' BF: ''That's not every day then is it.'' In the end he got angry but seemed to accept that he should at least try to cut them down for a week.

Secondly I mentioned that I'd posted here for advice. He badgered me until I told him 'exactly' what I posted. He said ''I never said you weren't tight enough

I told him I was really upset because I had made an effort to please him sexually the last two days and he had all but shrugged his shoulders at me. Now

I went through some of the things we could try. Exercises, more blow jobs, that he could look into penis sensitivity.

I encouraged him to tell me if he wasn't over his last girlfriend. I asked him if we had moved too fast. I asked him if he regretted moving me out here. I asked him if he was unhappy. He gave me all the right answers to these questions. I told him that I could leave in a month if that's what he wanted. He said it wasn't. He planned to spend his life with me.

And then. And then after saying to him ''If all this is true

And I asked him ''Do you find me sexually attractive, do you just think of me as a friend?''

And he said ''I do find you sexually attractive, it's just become a negative cycle for me because I know it will lead to bad sex.''

At this point I sat on his lap and looked in his eyes

So there we have it. My boyfriend can't think of me as a sexual being. I told him that meant he wasn't in love with me. And he said ''I am in love with you

I got super sad. We went out. I got drunk. I made a huge ass out of myself. I had to e-mail him an apology this morning.

Is that something you can fix? I don't know. We would both like to fix it. Has anyone in a marriage ever gone through a period where you don't find your wife/husband sexual anymore? I did have a breakdown once because of the abuse and he had to train himself not to treat me sexually

Maybe not so dead as some of those in here

It started as many deaths do, checking emails, flipping laundry and working out bills.

It was not my fault. It was not hers. Life simply changed. When we got together, getting a money order for rent. We fucked like rabbits and enjoyed it. We laid naked in bed until late in the afternoon if we wanted to, and we wanted to often.

Now, our to-do list must be prioritized and divvied up between us so that we even had a chance of fitting in going to the kid's friends' birthday party, getting a new AC filter from Home Depot, fixing that downspout that keeps popping a seam every time it rains, making sure we get to the farmers market for the local honey that keeps our daughter's allergies at bay, and still try to leave time for the dishes, laundry and detritus that accumulates as if with a mind of it's own.

We were tired. No, like a that thingamajig that sits in the junk drawer in the kitchen.

We knew we were supposed to hang on to it

Neither of us felt that the other was doing their part

It had to stop. I wasn't happy

So I came up with a plan. A daring

I was going to become a superhuman cleaning machine. I would push my limits of domestic ability. When I came home tired, open a diet coke and watch the antics of Paul and Jaime Buchman, I would resist.

I did dishes, swept, mopped, vacuumed, cleaned mirrors, scrubbed toilets. All with the reckless abandon of a crazy person. I'd listen to entire albums in my headphones while I put armies of cleaning crews to shame.

I'd bring her her tablet and a glass of wine and make sure she relaxed. Her smile was the reward. I wasn't looking for sex

I got it.

Soon, and I saw her appreciation. Appreciation turned to affection, affection turned to attraction and before I knew it, we were spending time together.

Not just in the same room, and we craved each other.

The doctor performing the study took a look at my vagina and asked if I had trouble with intercourse

Solution: surgery. Doesn't sound too nice but it was a fairly easy procedure where they cut away the wall and I was good to go home the same day. There were a few days with a little bleeding but after that I haven't been having any problems. And now I've tried out my new

You never, 4, 20 times a week. When it comes time to actually have sex, they're able to move their bodies just so, with just this frequency and just this pressure that they feel great. And they can describe how they want to be touched.

There are an absurd number of posts that are either ""I want to be able to orgasm during sex"" or (even more frequently) ""I want to be able to make my girlfriend orgasm during sex"" Let's address the latter first.

Listen guy, but by making it about her orgasm, you're really just making it about your abilities. You're only adding stress to the situation and making it that much harder for her. (this is especially true for those guys who say ""She says she doesn't care, but I just really don't want her to miss out"") 

That was a bit harsh, pleasing your woman = giving her an orgasm. This is a fallacy. For orgasmic women, of course the orgasm is important, but it's not the all-encompassing goal of sex the way it is for men. For pre-orgasmic women, many of them truly don't understand what all the fuss is about. When you ask ""but don't you want to have an orgasm?"" and she shrugs, take that shrug as it is: an honest, complete answer. So if you really want to please your woman, and stop trying to force an orgasm on her.


Now let me speak to the women who are truly interested in figuring out this whole climax business. You need to learn about your body. As I said above, shut the door, and get to work figuring out just exactly what feels good, what doesn't, and what makes you indifferent.

Don't expect your man to figure this out for you during sex. He is at a severe disadvantage. When he touches you, or painful. He has no clue until you shout or reflexively kick his head, and then it's way too late. When you touch yourself, you get an instant feedback loop. You'll stop the second something feels bad, and you'll keep going in exactly the same way once you've found just the right motion.

A quick comment about the ""urge to pee"" feeling. For those of you who don't know, can make a woman start to feel like she needs to use the bathroom. Naturally, she clenches down to prevent it, and in doing so prevents any possibility of climax. This is extremely common in pre-orgasmic women, even those who do not end up being ""squirters"" (is there a less graphic term for that?) You're going to need to learn how to get over it. This is yet another great reason to masturbate your way to your first orgasm, instead of sexing your way there. You'll be able to go at it without anxiety about whether or not you're about to urinate in front of someone.

That's all I have to say. I realize that in 4 days' time


Edit: some people seem to think that I'm saying masturbation will somehow prepare or teach you how to climax from penetrative sex alone. That is not the case. I'm fully aware that most women require at least some clitoral stimulation in order to climax. I'm saying that,,False,self,t5_2qh3p,True,,True

1304007432.0,gzehj,Can we put Herpes into perspective here?,draftboatkitten,894,336,467,"In my experience browsing Reddit I have noticed a lot of fear and disgust when it comes to Herpes. I'm here to try to convince you guys to simmer down and think about what it is you are all freaked out about by throwing down some facts.

1.) You might already have herpes and not even know it. Yep

a.) If it's asymptomatic it's difficult to detect in the bloodstream 

b.) It requires a specific blood test

c.) The medical establishment is not concerned about HSV2 the way it is about other STI's because, if you have never had a cold sore of blister, there is no reason to assume that you are clean *unless* you go to your doctor and specifically ask to be tested for the disease (and even then the test may not find it in the bloodstream). 

2.) You will be exposed to herpes in your lifetime. Let's crunch some numbers. First

Your chances of being exposed HSV1 herpes is way higher. Unless you are philematophobic, as we've seen, 80 percent of the population has oral herpes. Math!

3.) The worst part of HSV2 is the social stigma. I have herpes (obviously

Despite this

4.) Oral herpes and genital herpes are the same thing. The only difference is that one virus likes to live at the base of the spine and infect the genital area and the other likes to live in the nervous system nearer to the brain and infect the mouth. If you get cold sores

Also

Those of you who get cold sores (80 percent of you have it

I ask because I feel the moral duty to tell any potential SO of my HSV-2 infection before we get it on

4.) That [Alzheimer's-Herpes](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33191472/ns/health-alzheimers_disease/) connection is fully regarding HSV1

Which in turn means: If this study is on the right track, fork or chapstick with that they have the disease is actually quite serious considering they might be spreading not only the propensity for cold sores but the propensity to develop Alzheimer's later in life.

1. If you feel yourself coming close to orgasm
2. Calm yourself down
3. Relax your PC muscles as you feel yourself getting closer to orgasm
4. I also do my 13 times tables when things get drastic.
5. If you are literally just before the point of no return just stop moving completely. While you aren't moving just kiss her all over her body or hold her tight or whatever. A good one is to take her hand
6. Realise that coming early every now and then isn't a big deal. When I first started having sex I had this problem combined with troubles maintaining an erection and I worked myself up over it so much that it took three times as long to get over it. It isn't a big deal as long as you're working to improve upon yourself.
7. Change positions is an obvious one.
8. Vary your thrusting and realise that you don't always have to thrust. Sometimes I'll just push myself inside her slowly all the way in and then just rotate my hips in some fancy direction
9. Grandma
10. Don't forget to practice these things while masturbating. Most of us started wanking at home when our family members were in the next room. Our goal was to finish as fast and as stealthily as possible. Try to change that

I honestly think the most essential thing to keep in mind is that it is NOT a big deal if you come early; it's a big deal if you aren't able to satisy your partner. So if you do come early do them the courtesy of finishing them off in other ways. Also you have to keep in mind that it isn't a big deal

She then recommended I go to the specialist STI clinic. So off I went to be poked and prodded again. The specialist said again that it didnt look like herpes, swollen glands, itchy, sore). But again, it is still possible. 

I also had some bloods taken and am being tested for chlamydia, HIV and even had a pap smear done.. 

So right now I have two lots of HSV tests being done

I will probably update you again next week to let you know what the final diagnosis is.

**tl;dr**- 19 year old has no hopes of ever having an orgasm

Some information about me is that I'm 19 years old
I always thought I would be that woman in my 30's who had yet to experience an orgasm

**Some more background information**
I've been sexually active since I was 15, but after a while I stopped trying to make an orgasm my goal. Sex to me became an amazing connection to have with someone where we could both share our bodies together and make our partner feel amazing. It completely stopped bothering me that I couldn't orgasm, but that's definitely not the case with most of the men I had sex with. Many tried to tell me that they were going to be the one to change that, and yada yada yada. I was also never a fan of oral because it never did much for me. 

**How I got myself to orgasm**
I think the biggest change was that I started to really notice things about my anatomy that I had never actually thought played a part in the orgasm process. The shape of my vulva was a huge part of what set me back. I have outer lips that close everything else in, just pressing up on it. Since he wasn't moving his fingers I felt this urge like I needed to squeeze them for some reason, so I started doing kegels, all the while he is still licking my exposed clit. Oh my Jesus, Mary, and Holy Spirit. Doing kegels while getting oral is such an AMAZING feeling, I was in my own cosmic little world (that may or may not have been from the weed we previously smoked). I had my very first orgasm that night. When it happened I was extremely confused and had no idea what it was

Now I can give myself orgasms and I feel like my ENTIRE sexual life has completely changed because of this. I don't need the two fingers against my g-spot to orgasm anymore

1298650326.0,fslyp,Pretty sure my friend has THE WORST sex (horror) story imaginable.,,1034,497,335,"Let me first paint a picture for you of an old buddy of mine from high school. He was never the brightest bulb in the box - one time he couldn't spell the name of his own street (which is sad considering it was Spruce street). He was the type who always used the wrong words for everything and had a hard time understanding things. He dropped out of high school in the eleventh grade (but has since gotten his GED) and worked at a gas station, even if you paid him. He was also fairly nice to females - wasn't into playing games or anything like that. Also

1) Despite his shortcomings

2) He totally didn't deserve this.

So back in 2009, she put the breaks on and told him that she was a virgin, and wasn't sure if she was ready to make that ""emotional"" jump with a guy she barely knew. Hilariously, he was ready to back down right there, until she suggested sticking it in her pooper. Good for you, girl!

I guess he figured because she so readily offered her rectum to him that she was some sort of anal veteran. Unfortunately, and unceremoniously splattered shit all over his dick. Needless to say, he was freaked out and ran to clean off, while she ran out of his house, humiliated.

**But wait. It gets worse.**

Being the nice guy that he was, but she offered him oral sex. Really, it was the least she could do after shitting all over his dick. Unfortunately, it would seem that she wasn't the most experienced at giving head either, because the first thing she did was attempt to gobble his whole dick. It hit her gag reflex, and she puked all over the poor guy's pubic region.

**But wait

In the piece du resistance, ""You don't have a cat, do you?""

Yes

I wish I could offer some kind of proof of this. All you have is my word that a twenty-one-year-old guy would *never* willingly lie about something like this.

Anyway, which we never usually have the time/inclination for, so obviously I jumped at the chance. And it was really, really good and we both got very carried away in the moment, as you do. In the post-afterglow-afterglow, I pick up my phone and automatically click the Facebook tab (bad habit I know), and to my absolute horror, which is clearly about our love making. It was addressed to my SO, whilst we were reading it, asking that they come to us next time they had a complaint and also remarking about how childish and malicious their post was.

I have not been able to get this incident off my mind. I think it is awful that people think it is ok to shame others into being silent during sex. It wasn't at an unreasonable hour, yes the bed does creak, but we can't really do anything about that, it came with the flat and we are not exactly in a position to buy a new one, as the poster so kindly remarked. There is only so much we can do, of course we are aware that people can hear us and we are very quiet and considerate in everything else that we do around the flat. We have to put up with shouting, slamming doors, we can hear them pee, because he feels very self-conscious now

Sorry to rant a bit

Tl; dr, were they wrong to complain?
Edit: spelling and tl; dr

Edit 2: Thank you for all your helpful responses so far. I just wanted to clarify one or two things. The complaint was not your typical noise complaint, and I know their are many jokes about the British and sex, but I was surprised to see it was to some extent, true, nonetheless.The post said that my SO was unrhythmned, obviously a moron and that it sounded like he was engaging in a scrum. It wasn't a complaint about the noise, rather, and it made my very loving SO feel self-conscious. None of the above rang true for me

A lot of you have said that we give too many fucks. You are absolutely correct, more to do with the fact that that is just my nature, I am too self-critical and I care what others think of me.
Anywho, we're not screamers, I think the fact that sound carries so well through the building means that we will be heard however quiet we think we're being.

After meeting the other couple a few times

The game started slow by asking us about different sexual experiences we had and would like to have. After we went through all the survey and thought cards

Since we were playing this game as a stripping game, and they seemed to both be riding the same wave of pleasure ultimately culminating in their simultaneous orgasms.

Soon after this, they ended up ignoring the timer, and continuing until she reached an earth shattering orgasm. They then switched out, and my girlfriend had her first experience going down on another girl. Everyone was in agreement that this was the hottest point of the night. My girlfriend seemed like a pro. She was using her mouth and hands in ways that surprised even her. Ultimately she was able to bring herself and the other girl to climax multiple times.

At this point we all agreed that we needed a break. We sat and chatted for a little bit, and when they noticed the audience they had, they invited us over to help. When we crawled over there his girlfriend said ""let the bicurious fella' go first."" I then grabbed his eight inch dick, and started going to town. This being the first cock I ever sucked, I was surprised at how natural it seemed. I was making him moan while my girlfriend played with his balls, and his girlfriend sucked on his nipples. At some point my girlfriend had moved over and started giving her head while I was giving him head. Everyone was in pure bliss. At a moment when we both looked up we decided to switch out. I gave his girlfriend head while she sucked his dick. We then switched out once more until my girlfriend made his girlfriend cum yet again.

This time we took a longer break. Everyone decided to get something to drink and rest up for the final round. My girlfriend and I became impatient once again though and decided to just go ahead and start fucking. She was riding me hard when he walked back in the room and yelled for his girlfriend to come see this. They both came in and watched us fuck like rabbits. We told them they were welcome to join in if they wanted

After all the fun had been had

So now here I am, and the things I am looking forward to doing next time. My girlfriend and I talked a bit before she went to sleep, and we agreed that this ended up being a great decision for our relationship, and she too can't wait to do this again.

for me, because it just doesn't do anything for me if the girl isn't being stimulated. whereas going down on her is just as good as sex to me. (girlfriends seem to like this. :P) often times it takes considerable effort to stop going down on a woman begging me to fuck her (edging ftw).

As many saw, I want to make it known that this is not a step by step guide or a linear style of thinking. As Retiredpornstar said, these should be used to spice things up and not as a requirement or prerequisite to having a great time in bed. 

Now to the fun stuff. As men, making her scream our name and showing her who the boss is. I mean, that's what women want right? Well, sort of. As is life in any relationship, its about checks and balances, giving and receiving  and the joys that come with that. Just as women want to pleasure men, we as men have a responsibility to show that we aren't just dense piles of meat with a stick. We want, we NEED to show that we can provide the ecstasy and fulfillment that a women craves. 

I am going for chronological order but am also staying within the style that Retiredpornstar went with

1. Sending a text mid-day: This was pointed out for the women but is just as important for the men. We seem to have short term memory problems and sex is an indicator of that. We can go from 0 to 100 in a split second. Women can as well but warming them up before hand is much more satisfying and makes you feel accomplished. Texting about how sexy her curves are, make it good enough to get yourself hard. Remember, it is about HER, but feel free to throw in something to the tune of ""feeling your lips on my cock...."" as long as it is empowering to them. Make them feel confident in what they do and how much it really gets you off.

2. Be as cliche as possible: Here's where the cornball comes in. Do things she would normally do for you(for the love of god if you take this list as sexist then you clearly don't belong here, cloths, vacuuming  cleaning, taking the dog for a walk, making dinner, setting the table...etc. Whatever it is that she does for you that you know she would love for you to do, DO IT. Be romantic, be the James fucking Bond of dinner time. Imagine greeting her in a tux and bow tie with rendered duck breast with mango salsa, flowers and a table cloth. Even if you cant provide this level of class

3. Rev those engines: Now lets really get those endorphin's firing. Be catty, we have goods too and it is a waste not to be as creative as they can be. Caress her, gently touch her shoulders and arms, lightly kiss her neck, move your hands down her sides and just above pussy, run down her breasts and over her nipples...before and after she takes her cloths off. Even once your in the buff, use that cock as a teasing tool and not just a ram rod. Glide it down her ass, just straight up tease the shit out of her with it.  This is a drawn out process but you have to feel it out as well. Do not jump the gun but don't take too long either

4. Getting her wet and ready: Now that you have claw marks up your back and she is visibly shaking in desire, I mean lick her pussy. Lightly lick the lips, penetrating only in the slightest. Suck her clit, play with it on the tip of your tongue  While you do this, use your hands all over her body, rub her tits, grab them, caress her sides, kiss her neck

5. Lets eat out tonight: Now show her the size...of your tongue. Penetrate her pussy with your tongue, if she tries to pull you up, pull back down, grab her legs and push them up so that they are above your shoulders. Eat her ass; now this is more a comfort thing between the two of you but in all honesty, you should at least try if you haven't. No need to go all out like you do on her pussy, but just sneak a lick here and there, get the whole pussy/taint/ass area wet, we want her to crave things she never has

6. Enjoy some reciprocation: This is more a side note but if she wants to suck your cock after this, she feels the same way with you. Let her display her skills, let her show you how much she loves and adores your cock. let her tease you just as bad because at this point, she may want to try and one up you which is a good thing. If not and she is just enjoying it, awesome as well.

7. Lets get this show on the road: Now lets show her the motion of your ocean. Come up from eating her out, put her legs on your shoulders and slowly slide your cock deep inside her, as deep as you can go. You will feel how swollen and waiting her pussy is for your cock, but be gentle. Going all out will just lose all the anticipation you have built up. Move her pussy with her legs while you change angles of your cock, push her legs together, spread them wide apart, get that cock to rub against every wall inside her. I want you to be the man for once, show her you love her body

8. It's a Team effort: Now you can show her the love pounding machine you can be and fuck her shit to next sunday, suck and bite her tits, claw her back, show her how much she is getting you off and how fucking good it feels. Get in a rhythm with her, connect your minds and desires and put on a show for each other. Do what you love to do and throw in something exotic (ass play (and not just for her), pin each other down, grab her neck(widely varies and should only be done if you know she likes/is comfortable with it), over a table

9. The Climax: The moment both of you have been waiting for, it takes a lot more to get her off than you so make that moment explosive. You will see it in her eyes, you will hear it and you can see it from her body, when she is just about there take her to the point by hitting her spot over and over, even if it isn't the best for you. Get that cock deep in there and make her cling on to you for dear life, we want her just about motionless when this is done. Once she is just about there, get yourself ready to bust as well. There is not a better feeling in the world than you and her cumming at the same time, in the same position. This is the moment you both have wanted for each other the entire time so make it happen. When you cum, and this will just help her get off just as her cumming will help you get off. Its all about timing and reading each other. Make each other feel like the man/woman

10. The wrap-up: As dumb as this may seem, get a drink, take a bite of cold pizza, and feel accomplished and exhausted in what we did (its actually all biology, but that's for another day). Don't go anywhere, lay with her, kiss her, show her you are the caring and loving man and not just a sex machine. If she wants water

11. Spice it up right (the footnote): As with Retiredpornstars guide, add things I wouldn't even think of doing. Be the man that knows how to give and receive. Must you make her dinner just to be this romantic? no, not at all. You know each other better than anyone else so use it to your advantage. Just be smart about it and do what you do. You guys are together for a reason, you obviously have been doing something right to be with her so don't lose that side, but adding a little zip here and there can go a long ways to adding some fun to the bedroom.

So

 Last night we had romantic night in after a stressful day, candles were on...we were having a little slow dance in the kitchen when he asked me '' what are you thinking'', at this point I could feel his hard cock against me and I said ''I really want to suck your cock'', so I got down on my knees and did my thing.....
 ''Great I thought to myself

So after the BJ, I turn around a bit surprised and he tells me that he came...So I don't make a big deal, 
I say  ''No worries I'll just go and clean up in the toilet...''. I come out and he is serving up dinner

 Then later we are sitting on the sofa and I give him my horny eyes, just let it happen''. So I said I was doing it now because Iknow he gets annoyed when I try it last minute befores sleeping. I tell him I am going to bed and give him a kiss goodnight. He comes to bed 15mins later and is spooning me, I take his hand and guide it between my legs again and he says to me '' I thought you were going to be in here taking care of yourself/touching yourself''..huffed and rolled over.

I was so horny I got myself off beside him as he snored away. Seconds after my orgasm the tears start to fall down my cheek and I feel completley used and unwanted. 



EDIT:
  Thanks for all the suggestions and advice you guys have given. A few things stood out to me:

1.He doesn't get embarressed when he comes quickly so I doubt that theres a problem with his ''ego''.

2.Our relationship is very loving in other ways, so I doubt it is about his lack of interest in the relationship.

3. I have had numerous talks with him about our sex

4. I have told him I even feel awkward around him when I am horny because I don't want to be the one who is always lusting after him.

5. After these talks

6. I am going to sit him down and tell him how I feel and what needs to happen...Like he is a 5 year old
I will spell it out too him what I NEED and I will give him a chance to show me that he wants our sex the way it used to be. If after this talk nothing changes, but I hope that it will get better with all the suggestions you guys have given me...Thank you ;)

My sexuality is tied to my failures with my ex and I don't know how to get it the fuck back.,untying-sexuality,732,234,257,"**EDIT 3**: This really exploded with an unbelievably touching amount of emotional and practical support, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your messages

I have a small dick.  I'm well aware of what the averages are.  It's small.  Even when pressing as hard as possible into that little ""fat pad"" that I'm currently in the process of losing, that girth tapers off significantly toward my glans, which does not seem to hold much blood / firmness during an erection at all.  I'm mid-twenties, so what I've got is what I've got.  However, the numbers aren't the issue here.  The *usability* is the issue.

Was in a relationship for four years with my first love / best friend.  Lots of issues led to me having to end the relationship while not past my feelings.  The biggest thing that for some reason has just been *absolutely torturing me* for the past few weeks pretty much every single waking hour of every day has been my sexual inadequacy.

When we tried to have vaginal, ""I don't feel anything"" when I *thought* I was inside of her was the most emasculating experience of my entire fucking life.

*Two years* after the break up, several times in fact, that I was still dealing with residual feelings for her).  Everything finally hit me.  All of my inadequacy and my sexual failure and the fact that I tried so hard to be a satisfying lover in every other way I possibly could, yet she preferred to get from this guy after a few days what I invested myself in for four years and ultimately couldn't provide.

My inadequacy has become an obsession that I can't seem to control.  I hate it.  I've been looking into phalloplasty and the like

My sexuality is tied to my failure with my ex and the image of her enjoying the physical intimacy (and the emotional intimacy that goes with it) I couldn't give her so casually now is burning the inside of my head every time I even try to enjoy *myself* and just masturbate.

She deserved to live her own life without my issues getting in the way

I don't know how to get past this sense of worthlessness as a sexual individual or potential partner and I'm frankly exhausted of the back-and-forth of feeling like I'm moving on and then ten minutes later feeling absolutely debilitated by it.

I want my fucking sexuality back.  And most of all

**EDIT 2**: For those urging me to start working on myself and making changes, and I've since lost a *ton* of weight.  I have a lot more to go, but it has given me some seriously unexpected changes in perspective that have been both frightening and unbelievably exciting at the same time.  I kicked a gambling addiction a few years ago (well, I'm sober of it for over three years, anyway), and am in the process of kicking the ass of my compulsive eating disorder (also undiagnosed which is another reason I've wanted to see a therapist).  In general I've made greater efforts to monitor my health and have seen more doctors in the past few months than I have over the past ten years in order to actually check up on the things I thought were too small or too embarrassing to confront.

I'm not in as entirely bad a place as I likely came off in my original OP.  Mentally, I'm going to start looking into finding a therapist again.  I think, as this is the most pressing issue I can't seem to deal with, I'm going to try and find a sex therapist in particular, or at least one with experience there.

Thank you again.

**EDIT/UPDATE**: Thank you so much for your responses and suggestions and bluntness.  I've done my best to read through every response as I saw them

Therapy is going to happen.  I am resolved to it.  I understand the pointed responses in saying, but I acknowledge how helpful it will be to me.

As far as being a lover in other ways and alternatives to PiV, holding, rubbing, and giving pleasure in any way I was able.  It's one of the things that I pride myself on—caring about being an attentive lover.  Toys and sleeves and extensions and rings and all of that are things I am more than open to.  It's something I actually suggested in my past relationship, but it was shot down pretty much instantly (to be fair, I think it was her way of trying to say that she was okay without those things because she was worried about my inadequacy, though I genuinely wanted to try them for *both* our sake rather than just hers).  I haven't let that get me to discount the possibility in the future with a partner who might be okay with that.  

In general, I have reasoned things out fairly well, I think.  I know that size isn't everything to everyone and that not every woman *needs* PiV from the flesh itself (I actually posted in AskWomen a long time ago about this issue and was met with a bunch of women on both sides of that), and that vaginas come in just as many sizes as others.  I actually frequented this sub, as well as AskWomen and AskMen for a long time and have given a lot of this advice myself.  I guess it makes me a bit of a hypocrite to have so much difficulty taking it to heart, myself.  The issue that I am having so much trouble with is that logically reasoning this stuff out has little to no effect on the emotional side of these experiences.  I know it shouldn't and I know my options (as much as an inexperienced fellow can), but for whatever reason these memories and flashes of my inability and the idea of her with another fellow as well as my suspicion that there was some emotional cheating going on along the latter end of my relationship just show up *anyway* despite trying to reason it all out.

Someone suggested that this could be a mild form of PTSD or something.  I don't know how true that is, but I'm realizing that it might be a bit more immediately necessary than I thought.

Thank you, I certainly am feeling better today about all of this.  Just being able to get that out and share that with someone other than myself has been uplifting.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1362265750.0,,

OK... Calm down

I gave the the loudest involuntary yelp of my 23 years.

... 2 more terrified yelps and a stinging sack later I decided... This probably wasn't a good idea...

There may be no experience more unsettling than a single hair on fire exploding into a fire that sizzles its way down the hair of a large area towards your crotch... Just in case anyone had any doubts about this.

So I write this post in the hope that some helpful soul can link me to the original post I read about this which I can no longer find. I can't help but wonder if I was doing it wrong somehow...

But also to make sure people know that fine pubic hair can be very explosive when exposed to flame. While I know most people have probably spent a long time sitting and thinking that *their* genitalia are flame retardent

Tl:dr: I'm singed but there is still the possibility that I'll have grandkids someday

1331665394.0,quxaj,I got a threesome as a wedding present!,guxbot,1040,544,366,"I just got married last saturday! But before this great event my now wife gave me a threesome as a wedding present.

All of this started when we both decided that we would have a threesome and she told me that she would take care of it and that I shouln't be worried.

She kept me in the dark about all the plans and being secretive

So a week before the wedding day she tells me that I should prepare for a ""nice dinner"" and ""dress fancy""

By her instructions I drove to a place outside town, served by one of her friends as a waitress, the food was from our favorite restaurant, it was a nice feeling to just go with the flow and not have to worry about the little details. On the table there was a small box filled with card from the people we know full of happy wedding wishes for us. 

At the end of the meal she told me

Even if it was really cold we were burning hot with lust, they started kissing in front of me. I was stunned. Then my wife told me I should come closer, and the three of us started kissing and touching each other. The cold was so strong that my wife decided we should go to a room she had previously prepared. There was a fireplace that kept us warm while we took turns in the carpet, My wife was first, we kissed and touched every inch of her body while she moaned in pleasure. Then it was my turn, the feeling of being kissed by my wife while another girl gave me oral pleasure was amazing. 

Then they both started touching and enjoying each other while I fingered them both
Then we moved to the bed where my wife asked me to fuck the other girl while she watched and masturbated. I fucked her while watching my wife, unusual and overall very nice because I could feel my wife getting aroused by the sight of me fucking another woman. 

Then it was their turn to have sex while I watched

I fucked her and made her keep eating out the other girl, and it was glorious.

After that my wife and I decided the other girl should leave

We both agreed that it was an awesome experience and that some day we would have it again. 

What a great way to start a marriage.  

TL;DR: My wife planned a threesome as a wedding present for me. It was great to fuck two girls at the same time.

I will tell you a little about what happened. I was drinking (and a decent amount for myself) and me and my friends decided to go out on a weekend night. We headed to a club that I had never been before. It was fun and I was having a good time. At some point I got separated from my friends and tried to find them. I thought they might be outside smoking so I went out to look for them. I went out there and they were not there so I called them. When they finally answered they said to come back inside to find them. When I tried, twisted my ankle and gashed my knee. At that point I was trying to compose myself when hands grabbed me. He said he would help me and take me home. I told him that I wanted to take a cab. He insisted and given the state of my ankle and my level of intoxication I wasn't able to fight him off. He put me in his car. I asked him to then take me home. He told me we had to make a pit stop first. He took me to what I believe was his apartment and raped me. I don't remember saying no but it hurt and I kept asking to go home. When it was over he took me home.

The next day I went to the hospital and filed a police report. 

I have sought legal guidance and counseling. 

It has all been very traumatic and hard. Today I was unable to id the guy in a photo line up.

I want provide a first-hand account for young men out there who are struggling to find this type of primary resource.


Here is what I was dealing with and needed to retrain my brain from:

* I have masturbated to porn and porn alone from age 12 to 24
* I have had the same posture, etc for that entire time and have done so almost ritualistically so it became an extreme force of habit.
* My grip for those 12 years was punishingly strong. It as so extremely strong that it actually noticeably altered my musculature.
* I lost my virginity at 18 and lasted for 45 minutes with a beautiful girl before getting bored and calling it a night. That would turn out to be a typical experience up to present day.
* Despite being in great shape I occasionally suffered from erectile difficulty, which might be the most important thing. 
* Handjobs are a waste of time. Blowjobs too


Okay


* Stopped looking at porn for weeks and months at a time. Would stay away from porn which wasn't a huge strain on my willpower because I was so desperate to change my life and rewire my brain.
* Stopped fapping for weeks, I tried lying down, standing up because variety is important. I don't think quitting cold turkey is effective, but in moderation like once a week on average with a light touch worked for me. 
* Greatly reduced fapping to porn. Cut it out completely for a long time. I used my imagination about my current girlfriends
* Although I still don't come close during most of intercourse
* Handjobs and blowjobs still don't get me off yet but I don't see why I couldn't continue my training system to get there if I wanted to.

Now let's get things started ;)

- **Take control of blowjobs.** When receiving a blowjob, don't push too far down. For more hardcore individuals, push her down until it reaches the back of her throat. Pull out, look her in the eye and smile while stroking her cheek. Then ram your cock back down her throat. Repeat until satisfied. ""You should see how hot/slutty you look with my cock down your throat."" For subs, make her do this on her knees. If she closes her eyes or looks down, tug at her hair or grab her chin so she's looking at you: ""Eyes open/Look up, I want to see that pretty face of yours as you suck me.""

- **Facials.** ""What a pretty face you have...I think I want to see it covered in my cum"". ""I'm going to cum all over that pretty face of yours."" Once you've proceeded to unleash your load all over her face

- **Sex toys!** This could honestly be a thread in itself. Toys for bondage (i.e. rope, blindfolds), spanking (i.e. whips, paddles - though you can easily substitute with household items, things like rulers, the back of a hair brush, a cooking spoon, etc)

- **Take control of her masturbation.** Force her to touch herself but make it clear that she is NOT allowed to bring herself to orgasm. Get a remote controlled vibrator. Tie her up and use it on her - control the settings: bring her to the brink

- **Submission.** Make her wear a collar. Tell her she can only move on her hands and knees unless you give her permission. Command her in all aspects (i.e. ""I want your eyes lowered unless I say otherwise."" ""Look at me only when I speak to you."" ""I want you naked for the rest of the night, do you understand?"" Reinforce your punishments ""You know why you're being punished don't you?"" (Make her give you the reason) ""That's right, because you were a disobedient little bitch. Now are you going to do better next time?""

- **More intense ""rape"" play**: Shove her face down into a pillow while you take her from behind. Hold her down by firmly pressing your palm to her back

- **Slap her across the face** (this was previously in the Light BDSM but many redditors indicated that it's more medium/heavy): Slap her face with your hand (or cock)

- **Choking** (again was in light - should be here): Place your hands around her neck and squeeze lightly - never squeeze for too long

- **Make her clean you up after you cum:** If you cum on your stomach, demand that she cleans your cock after she ""made a mess by dripping her pussy juices all over it."" (Not a good idea after anal play for obvious reasons - instead, wipe your cock across her breasts/stomach)

**Edit: Adding one thing to spice it up even when you're NOT in the bedroom.**

- **Leave some nice hickies on her body. ""I'm going to mark you so you remember who you/this body belongs to.""**

- **If you had sex with her panties on (refer to Part One), and if you found out that she didn't keep them on, you will be punishing her. Make sure you do this when you/she gets home from work. Praise her for being such an obedient girl when you see that she still has them on.**

**Edit 2: Very, make sure you did not overstep your boundaries. Hug her, kiss her, hold her, cuddle her, tell her you love her, tell her how lucky you feel that she trusts you enough with taking control, etc.**

1344007906.0,xmfxb,From a Woman who just had a FFM Threesome Yesterday:  A How To Guide on Successful Group Sex and Group Sex within Committed Relationships,ahatmadeofshoes12,832,346,217,"So I constantly see questions on this site such as ""I want a threesome

Some background on me and my partner:  I’m a pansexual woman in a relationship with a straight man and we are both in our early 20s in the later part of college (early part of grad school).  I had never even kissed a woman prior to last night and this was my first threesome and also my partner’s first.  We spend several months talking about threesomes and figuring out what we wanted as well as it taking about 3 months to find the right partner.  We’re both pretty kinky in our regular sex life with each other and we’re pretty knowledgeable about sex.  Many of you on r/sex are probably familiar with my username since I’m pretty active here.  We met our partner online a few weeks ago and spend time messaging online.  Yesterday

**Talk to Your Partner:** Group sex requires a high level of sexual communication skills, and the ability to set aside feelings of jealousy.  You have to think of group sex as a form of nonmonogamy.  Too many people downplay threesomes because they are such a common fantasy but having a threesome is akin to opening your relationship so you have to know that you and your partner can handle seeing each other fucking someone else.  Talk to them about what you want and have a discussion about it in a non-sexual environment.  You need to be able to discuss what you want and what your comfort levels are rationally and openly.  Entertain the ideas you come up with in fantasy and discuss it for a long time before you take any action to find someone else.  Do not go out and find someone without your partner’s consent, for this to work both partners in the relationship need to be on board and equally enthusiastic.  If you feel uncomfortable with anything about the threesome then you aren’t ready to go find another partner.

**Dealing with Jealousy/Insecurity:**  With all forms of non-monogamous relationships this is always a concern.  It takes some time to develop the trust and honesty in your relationship you need to be able to allow your partner to play with someone else.  The best way to think about it is that most people fundamentally desire variety and this is about giving your partner sexual variety.  Just because he/she likes the unique traits of another individual does not mean he/she doesn’t still love you and your traits.  Group sex, and non-monogamy in general is about giving your partner the freedom to explore sexual variety that you may not be able to provide for them.  It’s a way of having your close committed relationship but still allowing some freedom to explore other traits and individuals.  Being able to attain joy and pleasure from watching your partner obtain pleasure from someone other than you, the feeling of compersion, is a necessary prerequisite for successful group sex.  In most cases if your relationship is strong going into group sex allowing your partner to explore sex with another person is going to make them more trusting and appreciative of you.

**How Do I Know if I’m Ready?**  You are not ready for a threesome, etc. if you:
  
* Experience visceral feelings of hurt

* You can’t discuss your wants

* You are having problems in your primary relationship with trust communication or compatibility.

* You want to use a threesome to “fix” your relationship.

* You aren’t really interested in your partner so you are using the excuse of a threesome to get a chance to fuck another person (just break it off with your primary if this is the case).

**What are you Looking for?**  Once you know your relationship is sound its important to decide exactly what you are looking for.  Do you want all partners to play together?  Do you just want two of the partners to put all their attention on one?  Do you want a man

**Boundaries:**  Despite the fact that you should be able to have a decent level of trust going into this it is understandable that everyone will have some boundaries so it is important to establish where the hard lines are.  A common one for heterosexual couples is that only the primary couple gets to have penetrative sex.  It’s a good boundary for many because it gives you one act to keep special in your primary relationship and it also takes away the risk of getting pregnant with a secondary partner.  Not all couples need this boundary and some may want additional boundaries.  Be sure to communicate them up front with your secondary partner/s and honor the boundaries he/she has as well. 

**Finding a Partner:**  If you do feel your relationship is ready and both partners are equally enthusiastic then you can now start looking for a third partner.  There are lots of ways to do this but for the most part you can pick a friend or go online to find potential partners.  If you want to ask your friends I guess the best way to do this is to first be honest about your interests.  If you have a sex-positive community of friends just letting them know you and your partner are interested in group sex may help get solicitations from others.  If you want to ask a friend I would just be direct and honest and ask upfront and then drop it

**Choosing a Partner:**  Now that you know your options on how to find a partner its important to know how to find the RIGHT partner.  It isn’t always easy to get someone who is willing to play with a couple so it’s often tempting for couples to pick the first person they find who is interested.  I would recommend that you get to know your partner a bit and see if they are the right fit.  You want someone you can trust, and can communicate well with you and respect boundaries.  One of the biggest things I want to point out is to NEVER treat your third as a toy to just be used.  He/she is an individual and they deserve your respect.  Treat them as a person and make every effort to make sure they enjoy the experience as much as you wish to.  In messaging most people can pick up on if you intend to treat him/her well and they will be hesitant to respond if your messages are objectifying and disrespectful.

**Final Words on How to Seal the Deal:** When you have found a partner either online or in real life I would take time to get to know them before you jump to having a threesome (if it’s a friend you may not need this step).  Message back and forth if it’s an online person or you can also talk in person.  Share fantasizes if you can; this is a great way to know if you can trust each other.  I would take your partner out on a date as a couple with the viewpoint that you guys can get to know each other in person.  Anyone involved should be able to call the whole thing off at any time.  

**The Event:** Be able to laugh and have a good time, you of course will be learning a new person sexually (which is always fun and leads to funny awkward moments), don’t take things too seriously.  Honestly from my experience yesterday one of the best moments involved my partner making Go Go Gadget jokes while I had my face buried in our third’s cunt.  Just remember sex is fun, its called “play” for a reason.

**Aftercare:**  After you guys play talk and cuddle some as a group and make sure everyone is okay emotionally and happy with what happened.  Check in with both your partner and your third.  Discuss if you want to do this again with your third.  When you are alone with your primary make sure they are okay and tell them how much you care about them and reaffirm your attraction and desire for them.  Reclaimation sex is a great idea (having sex alone with your primary to “reaffirm” your sexual desire for them) and in my experience it’s hot as fuck.

Good luck to all of r/sex in your group sex adventures

A little background - I've been married for 10 years, I masturbated alone pretty much every night. I assumed things weren't going to improve, and generally felt kind of bummed out when I'd read about all the fun things you young kids (well, 18+) were doing.

I was also kind of messed up about sex. I've had a fascination about women's clothes for as long as I can remember, and was digusted that I sometimes was turned on by other things. I'm not attracted to men at all, but I do feel I have a feminine side that I've been keeping supressed (I've not indulged in crossdressing for at least 10 years).

Anyway, and agreed with me that I should see a psychiatrist (we've seen one as a couple before).

Since then things have been amazing between us. My wife has been so understanding and is even getting into it - she sees how hot it can make me at times. We can barely keep our hands off each other during the day, and it's a huge weight off my mind that she now knows. I won't go in to huge details, but we've been communicating like never before, and experimenting with so many new things. We've ordered her very first vibrator (I can't believe she's never had one before), and are perhaps looking at a feeldoe for the near future (it seems that we might both like a little anal play).

I went to the psychiatrist wanting to be 'cured', and it seems that I might have finally sexually matured. I hope this inspires some hope for people in a similar lull in their sex life. And keep posting the fun things you're up to - as long as it doesn't require too much flexibility we might just give it a try (no pics, I promise).

 * If you don't like your sex life
 * Experimenting isn't just for the young 'uns
 * If you and your SO enjoy it and it doesn't hurt anyone

1364793081.0,1belio,I want to ache afterwards.,feelingkinky,721,234,184,"I've recently lost my virginity

I was always teased that I would be some kind of sex fiend. Being pretty petite

I like getting my boyfriend off, but I feel like I'm more of a giver in some aspects. My boyfriend also seems to finish fairly quickly once actual penetration starts, which... for me is what finally gets me going.

And once I'm going, I want to feel exhausted like he does, at least physically. I want to be thrown against shit, have my hair pulled, feel as though he's done some damage to my insides. I want to ache, to feel worn out. I want my hands held down, whether by him

I feel like I should enjoy the romantic sex, preferably with his fresh cum spilled on my body. I want to be used, and dominated. 

Of course.. then there is the other side of me

It's frustrating. I don't know how to bring it up. I don't want him to feel bad, but... is it really as easy as saying, ""I want you to cum all over me?""

After we're done or whatever, but he thinks I must be joking. He always chuckles and goes, ""What have I turned you into?"" [Insert grin and a kiss] ""I need to rest!"" [Pretends to pass out, before laughing and cuddling me happily.]

And then, like I just had a sample and I know I won't get the main course.

Is there anyway I might be able to bring this up? Or help him last longer?

I(M29) have been seeing this woman (F26) for a few months now. We've been on about 7 dates. A week ago

This Wednesday she called over to mine and after some fooling around she asked if I had a condom. So I start to undress her and notice shes looking away the entire time. No eye  contact what so ever. I m kissing her all over but she is just lying there. I put it down to nerves. 

So we re now both naked, She starts to get nervous to and says ""This has never happened before"" and ""your just to wide for me"". I am by no means more than average in lenght or gurt. I ask her to get on top try that way, she really skittish about it but evetually agrees but same thing. It just wont go in. 

Finally I suggest we use some lube and eventually I get it in. The entire time we re having sex

Eventually I finish and again just akward silence from her.

As I m getting off her I notice something on the sheets. A kind of bloody slime. I say nothing as I dont want to make a big deal out of nothing. The rest of our time is spent lying there until she goes home. 

Now as I said I'm not sure if she was

What do you think?

Should I say anything or just leave it alone?

I doesnt make any difference to me and I m not sure if knowing would have just extra pressure on but I guess if I had known I would have liked to have tried to make it a little more special than a quick romp.

EDIT: I cant believe this is necessary but I guess I have to get this across. 
We are both consenting adults. 
She initiated sex. I put no pressure on her to do this
At any point she want to stop all she had to do was say so.

I did not force myself on her.

1329410505.0,psgwt,Slut-shamed and now kinda repulsed by my husband,remedialfeminism,903,421,407,"My husband and I have only been married for three years

I came into the relationship at the end of my rockin’ single 20s, and he only had two sexual partners before his wife – whereas my number of partners is well into the double digits.

So my husband has apparently never been with a woman who acted on her own sexual feelings before. His wife acted like she hated sex because of a traumatic adolescence

In the beginning of our relationship, rough sometimes, oral, touching myself in order to finish if he wasn’t able to make me orgasm, etc. Pretty tame stuff, actually. It never occurred to me that this might make him uncomfortable, as he was obviously enjoying it

He would need constant reassurance from me after sex that I hadn’t been molested as a child, though he wasn’t doing it deliberately and I’m sure he’d be horrified if he knew that’s how I saw it. As the arguments became more frequent, I became more angry and uncomfortable, and now we rarely have sex at all.

I don’t know how to enjoy sex anymore because I don’t know what is appropriate in his mind for a girl to do or not do in bed. And I minored in women’s studies so I am hyper-aware of how icky and oppressive this double standard is, and he wishes like hell I would go back to being his super-sexy girl. But I’m afraid it’s too late. I don’t initiate and I’m scared I never will again. Here are the reasons I can’t imagine initiating sex with him:

* Raging discomfort. No idea what is or is not permitted for me in his narrow idea of female sexuality.
* Loss of respect for him. I know he still wants sex because he complains about the lack of it a lot, he will approach me on occasion, whereupon I freeze and have to repeat over and over to myself to relax, and eventually we do it and it’s fine, but I’m just getting it over with and he has to know that. We used to have real sex, that we both enjoyed, and now we don’t and he’s just fine with it?! Eww.
* Loss of attraction to him. Related to the point above, or me stretching my back in front of him, without getting sexually frustrated. It’s creepy as hell. And he’s a minute man. He can’t rub me or play with me too much because he’ll come, and when we do have sex he comes within 10-20 strokes no matter how slow and boring he’s going.

I don't know how to fix this. We've had conversations about it from time to time, and I want to make this better.

I didn't get too upset as it's just a story, and that a girl he had been with before me was called that (a girl who he has had inappropriate contact with while we were together also which tore my fucking heart out). So I was kind of upset. I didn't make a fuss, I just told him I read the story and he went up and deleted it and assured me that it was from ages ago, the file was just new because it was transferred from his old laptop.    
This started a discussion on why he wrote such dirty explicit things about this girl, but because I'm his wife and he loves me so much he doesn't want to do really dirty filthy things with me. That.. kind of hurt my feelings. That he had these feelings for someone else but I'm just some non-sexual ""wife"" to him. I asked if he thought he would think of me differently if we did do nasty things and he said he doesn't know, but doesn't want to try and he needs to take things slow.    
I find this weird. I have the opposite feelings to him, it makes me really worry if we do have children will I become even more desexualized in his mind? I think it's likely although if I ask he is sure to say that it's not the case.

I asked!  All it took was a discussion for her to go from uncomfortable with the idea to saying we could ""do it in the butt"" during her period.

One night in bed, so I did not push the issue further that night. I let the discussion end with her knowing I wanted to try, but I was not in any rush and was very clear that it was only something that would be done if/when she wanted to try.


She tried teasing me once about it

Patience. I did not bring it up again. She did. First, anal was not normal, ever).  She asked about how it works, and I emphasized gradual introduction- taking it slow and making it clear that she was the one in control of everything at all times. Her curiosity was satisfied after that, and I let it rest.


This past Friday

We went to bed later, with lube, worked my finger inside of her. We made out with my finger inside of her for a few minutes before she told me to grab the lube and go for it.  I went slow, but she was so relaxed I slid right in. I kept asking her how she felt and if she was okay (she was) and before I knew it we were really going at it. I used my fingers to rub her clit and it didn't take long before we both got off.

She was all smiles afterwards- couldn't believe we had anal and was excited to try something new! She also kept saying that she couldn't believe she lost her anal virginity

To begin with, a smile on your face and a little bit of a laugh is perfect for making both you and him more comfortable and relaxed.


Now there’s more than one way of getting into a blowjob for your man


**Teasing:**


Blowing can be an exploration and about getting comfortable with him. I have most fun by drawing it out as much as possible but that doesn’t mean you’ll be the same. Now when I say ‘drawing it out’, stroking, but not quite sucking.  Be playful by nibbling, kissing and softly biting his skin - vary between this and lightly licking him up and down his shaft. Don’t feel like you have to go in quickly, mix it up a bit, almost like you’re giving him a preview of what’s to come. He won’t know what to expect and that will build the intensity and excitement. Engrossing yourself in him can be lots of fun – just really get involved, get close to him and stay there.


Get his penis nice and wet with your kisses and begin massaging him with your hands or even in between your breasts, try to experiment similarly whilst moving your hands around his balls and shaft, keeping your movements smooth and wet at all times.


**Straight In:**


Not all blowjobs have to be long and drawn out, especially when he’s moaning in pleasure because he didn’t expect you to do something.  Moaning because of the psychological element that’s added. Know that if he’s moaning then whatever you’re doing is good and you should repeat it as often as you like. If your guy isn’t very vocal, encourage him to give you more feedback. So forget about your hands at first and concentrate on getting everything immediately wet. If you’re not afraid of deepthroating, this is a great time to get straight to it. And if it’s something new for you then I have a few handy techniques to soften the blow...


**Deepthroating:**


Learning to deepthroat isn’t a necessity


Relax your mouth completely making sure you are in a position where your throat can be as open as possible. You want to start slowly, remembering to stop and get used to how this feels – this will make deepthroating at a faster pace when you are more confident much easier as well. Don’t forget to breathe! … don’t rush, the experience is meant to be a slow, luxurious thing for both of you and there’s not a right or wrong way of doing it, especially in a loving relationship where you can laugh it off and get right back to it with no pressure.


Getting past the gag reflex is simply down to practice and it is as simple as that - there are some good guides online which aided me when I had that issue.


1)     Slowly taking in as much of him as you can – going a little further each time so he really feels the difference of how deep you can go.

2)	Suck and hold onto him with the pressure of your lips before quickly pulling off - and repeat. This will involve coming off him completely before going back to him and changing the speed of this will make him feel good.

3)	Movement of the tongue is more limited the deeper you go. Don’t be worried if you can’t move much with your tongue but enjoy the movement you can make on the areas of his shaft you can reach. This will vary depending on how versatile your tongue is so light flicks and massaging him slowly will feel amazing – keeping eye contact if you can.

4)	Temperature changes by either softly blowing cool air or breathing on him. This can be something to do before you start deepthroating

5)	Change in movement: whilst deepthroating clamp your lips around him at his base and suck slowly as you retreat up towards his tip.

6)	Let him know you’re enjoying it by looking up and smiling as you release the tight suction you have applied with a light ‘popping’ sound.

7)	Don’t be afraid to mix up going deep with paying attention to his tip and other areas. As much as he may like you going deep

8)	Gulping while you’re very deep: throat vibrations do a lot of good and it will affect all of him because he is so far inside of you.


**Other techniques**


**Hands:**


Bring in your hands to add something different into the mix and work with what your lips and tongue are doing - your hands should keep busy.

These are three enjoyable tried and tested positions for a blowjob with hands:

1) Not using hands at all from a kneeling position.

2) Wrapping your hands around the base of his shaft – best when he’s lying down or sitting back in a chair where you can position him towards you. Good for deepthroating.

3) With one hand around his balls


Hands are a great for supporting and continuing pleasure when your mouth is taking a two second break and with the correct pressure can add the perfect amount of intensity to a blowjob.


Lightly, but for men. Place your hands at the bottom of his shaft and gently massage in a circular motion.


**Positions:**


The best positions for most individuals greatly depend on the couple, use the bed to your advantage. You could:


1)	Get him to sit on a chair and kneel in between his legs on a pillow. Good for all over action

2)	Him lying down (bed or floor most likely)

3)	Him standing up – you could be kneeling/sitting/lying on the bed as he stands next to you – this is probably best for deepthroating. If you are confident and can get the right height.

4)	Him putting one leg raised on the bed whilst standing as you’re on all fours/on your side at the correct height/bed. (Good for a change of position from lying down on the bed).

5)	Lying down in what would be the 69 position but to the side of him on the bed. Great for him to get to you too and he’ll be able to see everything you’re doing which is a massive turn on.

6)	If you’re looking for something specifically good for deepthroating (also try on a chair) then him standing next to the bed whilst you lie on your back with your head just off the bed/table/object of decent height

7)	Not to mention

Well, but for us it was pretty huge. 

I pinned her down, slapped her, pinned her arms behind her in doggy style to the point of pain and did that thing where you hold on inside her mouth during doggy like the reins of a horse, really hard. 

My insults went from generic (worthless slut) to pretty much the worst I could come up with, that I was more attracted to her friends, and how stupid she was not to realize this.

Despite my best efforts, without her having said the safe word. We cuddled, I told her I loved her and that I hadn't meant any of what I said and everything seemed fine. Until about 20 minutes later, I noticed she was shivering, even shaking violently, and when I turned her around tears were streaming down her face. I immediately tried to console her and asked her what was wrong, she tried to say she was fine but couldn't stop sobbing and shaking.

I have never felt so guilty in my life. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom after a while to puke my guts out and now I'm crying in my room and don't know what to do. I know the advice is going to be talk it through with her, tell me what to do or that its alright. God, I hate myself right now.

**EDIT:** Writing this quickly because I'm gonna spend some more time with her (probably a lot) to finish talking this through. I just wanted to thank all of you so much! The whole thing went far better than I could  have hoped for.

I held her more tightly than ever before probably and repeated to her that I loved her

She told me then to stop apologizing, and also my greatest fear, were the insults I had thrown at her towards the end, and several people in the thread seem to agree that those were way over the line. She dismissed my fears, saying that she knew I didn't mean any of it (thank fuck, yes, i don't even deserve to be this lucky) and that it even turned her on.

Taking some advice from the thread, and the STRANGEST damn thing happened. Discussing every part of what had happened with her, how she reacted and felt towards everything I did, we both got incredibly turned on, and I really started to get what people find so hot about rough and dominant / submissive sex.

Having said all of this, we're gonna clearly discuss what we're both comfortable with and what to do and move in the tiniest baby steps.

This will impact the angle at which you can best deep throat it. You will figure this out on your own and will be specific to the individual. 

Some guys cocks are really wide in girth

That said... Let's talk anatomy: your throat naturally slopes back and downward. If his cock is long enough to deep throat (some may not get long enough, this post is irrelevant to you), then you are going to have to relax your throat and swallow at some point. This will take practice and is best practiced in a position where you have control over how far down your throat the cock goes. Start slow, because your gag reflex will probably be an issue at first. (I will do another post in general blow job tips, but this one focuses on deep throat techniques.) 

Example of how an erect cock's angle affects performance of this technique: My favorite position with guys who have a cock that curves slightly upward or straight out when erect is me on top, though. This latter position is best after you have been successful at deep throating it a few times already.   

The basic secret is swallowing. Make sure your mouth is not dry when uou start out. After the first swallow and ""retreat""

Lastly, you have to relax. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly unless your man has a vomit fettish (hey, there's a fettish for everything), do not eat beforehand. Give your food time to digest first. If you plan to eat dinner on your date, surprise him with a before dinner quickie blow job or take a walk after dinner, because walking helps digestion.

The options and combinations are limitless.

She will cum so easily like this, if you can hold her in place.

She starts to beg for it.  She hates being teased like this.  To her, just trying to hold on for support.

She's really going now.  I have to rise up and use my weight to hold her in place.  My god, and she knows it.

""Please....I....it needs to be now.""

Back Story: We stopped having sex right after my wife got pregnant with our fist child

That was it

This started a problem that existed right though to the end of our marriage. We would often go 2 - 4 months with out any sex at all and then I was allowed (this is how it felt to me) to make love to her. After 2 years of rarely having sex with my wife at the incredibly horny age of twenty-two I would often sleep on the couch so I could masterbate and go to sleep.

Willing to do anything I started counseling for sex addiction, horny, (24 year old now) male, and that was it.
My sexual appetite was not over the top or excessive

We only ever ""made love"" with her participating as little as possible for the first seven years of our marriage. 
No oral sex for me at all, sighs and objections. ""I just sucked it!"" she would complain. After hearing her complain I would go flaccid and this would piss her off. 
Several times I just stopped the session and got dressed. She would get angry and not understand why hearing her complain and roll her eyes left me ""out of the mood"". Eventually she told me how much she disiked it and hated it and didn't want to do it. 

Have you ever gotten a blow job from a woman who told you how much she hated doing it for you? It does make it hard to enjoy. Many times she would throw it in my face that she had given me head. Often she would yell things at me like, but of course she wasn't ever going to.

At one point, I took photographs (No, I don't have them, she does) and I was very humilating towards her. 

She loved it
She was letting me have sex with her and she didn't really participate

I found a sexual spark in her and it helped quite a bit so I was trying to find more. 

We tried swapping (we had 3 encounters with others seperately)
It was fun and exciting and we both handled the events with no jealousy. We even had sex afterwards while we described the encounters to each other in detail.

My only problem was she gave each one of them oral sex
At a later time I asked her about that and she said wanted to impress them and she thought it was expected. So why not try to impress your husband and why don't you think it's an expectation for me?
""Because we are married
 
At this point in my marriage I still wanted to make it work and started working on compromises. All I wanted was for her to actively have sex with me. Sure I had a lof of kinks and fantasies I wanted to experience with her
When discussed she would always say  different things she neeeded that prevented her from having sex with me. Like a dumbass I followed this rabbit hole hoping for improvement of the situation.

Note: What I know now

So, or we needed to go out more and have more fun. It was always something I needed to do or change to make her happy, and I ignorantly went along with it hoping for the best.

Every compromise was the same, 5, weeks would go by and she would do nothing. I would follow through by being Mr. Enrique Suave or I would do more housework and be Mr. Mom. Keep in mind she was a stay at home mom and I was working full time in construction (60 hours, often over 70) and we still split the chores. Cooking, laundry, shopping, etc. 

My sexual advances were usually rebutted with a spattering of random success and never any oral. She would often come on to me kiss and touch and then turn me down. ""Just because we kiss doesn't mean I want to have sex"". When I would protest a phrase I heard a thousand time was

Funny, I was home every night to be with my wife and kids. I didn't run around, hang our in bars or chase women. I was dedicated and committed to my marriage and kids. 

After a few weeks I would bring up the fact that we had a compromise and though I was meeting her requests she had not acted upon mine.
She has a pattern she follows. Lie, change topic. It is most dizzying to try and have a discussion with her.
The fight that would ensue would leave us at a stalemate for 2 -4 weeks of rare conversaton and interaction
This would last 2 - 3 days of generally great sex (no oral) and then she would start to turn me down again. We would go weeks, come to a compromise and start the whole cycle over again.

When we had sex, more oral, hell give me a minute, I will be back in action.
We could be having great sex and as soon as I finished, get dressed and go back about her day. Now after I cum, I get this horrible feeling of inadequacy. The thought now of a woman wanting to continue having sex after I orgasm scares me to death.

This lasted until we were married for 18 years. The cycles would last anywhere between 3 - 6 months

Once I went 3 months that I didn't hold her hand, nothing. Finally she asked ""Hey, you have not tried to have sex with me, is something wrong?"" How long would it take you to say something if your S.O. stopped touching you physically?

She refused to be on top or take a leading role in any sex we had. I rolled her over on top of me once and she sat there waiting for me to do something. She got angry and stormed out of the room when told her to move, put forth some effort, you do some of the work and participate.  

After 18 years I told her I wanted a divorce but I didn't want to be away from my kids. Growing up in a single parent home (with my mother on welfare) I didn't want to give my kids the disadvantages that come from being in a single parent home.
I didn't want strange men roaming in and out of their lives and I wanted  consisent strong father figure for them

I told my wife I would stay and we could be amicable and get along for the kids. We had already been together for 18 years, we would honor our responsibility to our kids and go on our way. 

I told her explicitly I had tried hard enough  and if she wanted to save this marriage she knew how to do it, and move along like nothing ever happened. She did not try. In her own words I should be thankful for what I have and forget about what I want.

I had been planning all along to grow old and die with this woman. But you cannot force a man to go his entire life with out sex

TL;DR; After 20+ years in a sexually dysfucntional marriage how do I get out of this mind fuck?",self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zaaws/how_do_i_get_over_20_years_of_sexual_neglect/

In the last few months I noticed that if I made *any* indication that i would like to have sex, get out the massage oil... and she ended up wanting to watch movies. I remembered though, a time not too long ago, where our kids were away for the night, and I had thought that she was tired and not feeling well, so I never said anything about sex at all.  10pm rolls around, and I notice she is acting oddly, but i realized she wanted to have sex.  It is extremely hard to get her to just come out and say she wants sex

I also realized she would back off any time i talked about wanting more in the bedroom, and i asked her if I could write down 3 things that were very simple and she could pick one, or none of them, and then at any point she felt like doing that, even if it took months, we could do it, when SHE was ready, so I said 'what if i used my hand to get you to orgasm, ideally, so why not ask the other one for things we like?  Then she said that she didn't know why

This same woman, al though admittedly she was drunk.  I have pointed out to her that being drunk doesnt make her do things she doesnt want to do, it lets her do things she would like to do, but otherwise wont, for whatever reason.  So i feel she has a wild side in her, like we all do, but she will not say what she wants, and she said yes.  We ended up just having sex in a more slow and passionate way for the rest of our relationship, over 11 years.  She will not say anything she likes.  When i asked her how I should find out if she is in the mood for more 'energetic' sex, she will be turned off.  So she wont say what she wants on her own

She also doesnt want to see a counselor, where she feels pressured, is what has caused our sexual problems.  She has told me that every relationship she ever had, she was into sex at first, but then as the relationship went on, her interest dropped.  She thought it just had to do with things being more fun when realtionships are new, I think there is something else going on here.  At 38 years old, and if i make one statement asking if she will have her period on a saturday

Any women out there that can give insight into this?

It’s pretty astounding how many posts we get in /r/sex from men who are super stressed out about the size of their penis. The average penis length is between 5 and 5.5 inches. That means the *majority of men* have penises that are that size. If you’re a bit smaller or bigger than that, and you’re getting into territory that’s more rare. Most of the men coming to /r/sex have penises right in that average range. In no way is average a bad thing. Average tends to be average because that’s the way penises have evolved, usually in conjunction with the size of a vagina. Vaginas are, on average, 3-5 inches when the woman is unaroused, and 5-8 inches long/deep when the woman is sexually aroused. But perhaps the most important part- it’s only the first couple of inches that are very sensitive on most women. This is where many many nerves are as well as where the g-spot is. Above that, the tissue only has stretch and pressure sensors. And those of you engaging in same sex play, then use toys for that). 

We’re big advocates her e for learning how to use what you have. It's all about positioning, do they need clitoral, g-spot, anterior fornix, rectouterine pouch or some other erogenous zone to be stimulated? It's about not just trying one thing and expecting it to work on them- you need to try a range of things and really explore their entire body and learn how you can move so that your penis gives your partner as much pleasure as possible. You figure out what positions work best for your penis. And you always have your hands, mouth and toys. Sure, some people feel they need a partner with a big penis. Others prefer average sized. Others prefer smaller size. Most, don’t give a shit about size as long as their partner works with them to figure out how to make the sexual experience as good as possible.

*Overall body*

When we talk about body image issues, can have body image issues. In the society we live in, it’s no wonder that negative body images are on the rise. For most people, they believe they’re too fat and that it’s all their partner is thinking about when they see them naked. That their partner must be judging them and thinking about how gross they look. Sorry, but for the vast majority of people, this is not the way it works. Your partner knows *exactly* what you look like. And guess what? They still want to be sexual with you. They still want to see you fully naked, with the lights on, in no way does that mean they’re not attracted to yours. They’re simply attracted to a range

We get lots of questions about stretch marks, ingrown hairs and other sorts of skin issues. There are very very few people out there who don’t have these. Almost every woman over 20 has cellulite and/or stretch marks somewhere. We just don’t see it in magazines because they’re airbrushed out. And models/actresses are constantly using tricks for smoothing their skin out and covering up their stretch marks, etc when they’re on camera. And there’s also the beauty of editing. So this means it’s rare for people to see just how common this stuff is. Either way, we’re all our own worst critics and in no way is our partner paying attention to that stuff. They’re just happy to be having “sex” with you! And if your partner is being critical in a really harsh way and making you feel bad about yourself, then it may be time to leave them and find someone who appreciates you as you are and who makes you feel good about yourself. Make sure you’re eating healthy (which does NOT mean totally restricting yourself) and being physically active in a healthy, enjoyable way. We promote health here, not unrealistic standards of beauty.

We were sitting at a secluded picnic table and started making out.  I think I'm an excellent kisser but I was surprised when she started moaning and after a minute gently pulled away and said she needed a minute to catch her breath because she had just came.  She was straddling my thigh and I could feel she was wet through both of our pants. She wasn't grinding on me so I'm positive she didn't cum from rubbing on my leg. I talked to her earlier today and she confirmed that she had in fact had an orgasm from me kissing and touching/caressing her face and neck.  She said this had never happened before and didn't know it was even possible.  Has anyone else had this happen or even heard of it?  What made her orgasm?  Neither of us could figure it out.

I am sharing this story here in order to hear if anyone else has a similar story

I have been able to make myself come with clitoral stimulation since I was quite young (12 perhaps), feet stretched out). No partners have been able to make me come. I have had two long relationships (3 years and 4.5 years) and a total of 15 sexual partners, some with lots of experience, and some with very little.


When I met my current bf, experimented and enjoyed sex in other ways. I have always enjoyed sex, and an orgasm has never felt like a necessity for me. He would usually just watch me get off if I felt like it.


Then he found my g-spot, any fingering had always made me confused (it felt like two different kinds of stimuli that didn't help each other). I discovered that if he didn't move his finger out (just stayed inside and touched my g-spot) while I stimulated my clitoris in my usual way and position, I would get intense orgasms. 


Then, and it felt absolutely amazing. He did it twice, but now we are more than 8000 km from each other again, so it will be a while before we get to try out more. I hope this can help encourage other people who thought it might never happen :-)


I think the fact that I had given up, helped just as much as the technique. I am not sure, I am still feeling ecstatic, and can't believe it happened :-)

When we first got together sex was amazing, she's still happy with her receiving foreplay but she never reciprocates. For example if I go down on her and she comes then she tightens up and we can't have sex but her idea of helping me get off is asking if I want to masturbate over her whilst she lays there looking bored.

How can I tell her that I don't want to continue like this without sounding like the worst person on earth? She still enjoys sex its just like she's there to get her orgasm with the minimal amount of effort and then roll over and go to sleep. Aside from the sex our relationship is brilliant, nice place together and I do about 90% of the chores.

I think the title of this post is self explanatory. Last night, which we didn't do often. Most of the time, she would suck me off for a while and then we'd have sex.

However, I never managed to reach an orgasm. Because my sensitivity is really low or something. 
I knew she was getting bored and I knew that after that she would be turned off

The fact that I was affecting her confidence was another blow in my face. I got really pissed and we ended up not having sex afterwards that night. 

We had sex this morning, I lasted about 5 minutes, which really bothers me. Why can't I cum from a good BJ when after 5 minutes of sex I have to hold back already?

My question is about ""hidden camera"" sites. I think we can all agree that filming someone without their consent is pretty damn unethical. I wish it didn't turn me on so much. I do my best to stay away from sites like that, really hard, I might add. I don't want to feel like a terrible person, so I have two specific questions:

First of all

tl;dr I'm better now, and a new relationship starts.

The update: Its been 3 weeks since the event
To the fellow redditors who shared their experiences with these ""urges""
I've also read a bit of sex at dawn and it does help. The whole sperm competitive nature thing did help me rationalize it a bit. That and the Dan Savage notion of ""Making sexual lemons into Bonerade"" really did come together in the end for me.

As for the gf

For those who want to know
After the reddit post that night, she was hiding out in the same motel I was at (what are the chances?). She came to my room, and we cried with one another that night. We discussed how we would deal with it, and how our friendship could continue, and decided that we needed to talk about all this together.

We all met a few days later to talk and put it all out there. It gets kinda weird, and b) that they were willing to break of all ties forever for a chance at redemption. They both were saying they'd do all kinds of things to earn our trust back (give us their passwords to e-mails and facebooks, their cell phones, call records, etc.). But the more they spoke the more it dawned on me; they really are a great match. They way they think, the way they talk, even gestures, but the more I think about it

I wish I could have taken a picture of everyone's faces when I said they were perfect for each other. But as I explained it, my exgf moved all her stuff out and went to live at his place. His exgf, (who was from out of town and moved back here with him) having no place to go, is now rooming with me and we've been sorta helping each other through the whole thing. And before you ask, no there's nothing between us, a thing right now after all this is the last thing on either of our minds.

Let me preface this by saying: I'm married, here goes: 

My wife is out of town, but whenever she's gone I masturbate at least 2-3 times per day. Self-diddling never tides me over as long as a great fuck does.

Anyway, drives her absolutely crazy. I mean she comes completely unhinged when she cums with either me or the plug in her ass. 

I pull her bin down and dig out the butt plug. This thing looks huge, and if she can take it why couldn't I?

I figure anything is worth a shot if it feels good right? As a quick size comparison

What the hell

I get out the lube and grease the butt plug up with what I thought was more than the surface area could even handle. I rub a bit on my ass and think ""ok - here goes"". For distraction I put on some internet porn

I slowly start easing it in, not quite to the largest part of the plug, it FUCKING HURTS! It felt like I'd split myself in half! I quickly pull it out and go check myself in a mirror to see if I'd torn anything.  I hadn't, so far my ass seems ok. Undeterred, I give it another shot. Same deal, I get about 3/4 of the way on and damn it feels like I'm being ripped apart. So I tried another tactic, and just try to frig myself with the end of the plug - but it's really not doing anything for me whatsoever. At this point I decide fuck it

I zone into the porn for a few minutes, after a bit I start actually getting into it and can feel the first sensation of that ""Oh... I'm going to cum"" feeling. It's at this point that I unthinkingly grab the butt plug, reapply a TON of lube, position it on the stool under me, and slowly but steadily sit on it. This time the thing hits home. No pain, no feeling of stretching my lips over my head, I even had a moment of ""For real? That just happened? Is it really in?"". I feel oddly full

My body went stiff, but that's pretty much secondary at this point. My mind was totally blank - it was crazy, I had fully lost control of my entire body. There was nothing I could do, no way to stop it, I was going to cum right that instant. I pull out of the fleshlight and cum harder than I ever have in my life. A the same time, my body stiffens and the butt plug shoots out of my ass across the room. 

For a few minutes afterward I just laid there

That was the most amazing orgasm of my life. Guys seriously

Anyways

* Condoms almost never work.  They only test .01% (1/1

* condoms need to be kept at a certain temperature to work, they were defective by the time they get to you
* any boy wo truly loves you would never even consider having sex with you before marriage
* Birth control can hide signs of pregnancy and doesn't work as well as they say
* They did this presentation, one for the boys and one for the girls.  They put the tape on the first people (one boy, one girl) in line, and it represented sex.  The. Tey moved the tape to the second, then third person, representing break ups and sex with a new person.  Then they had the tape, who were soul mates, but we're easiert to pull apart because they didn't have the same solid foundation (or, because they would be just as stuck.  She just said ""it doesn't work that way"" and refused to call on me the rest of the week.






What I was taught at an overly conservative bible camp

* if a man wants to have sex with you
* no man who *really* loves you would ever want to have premarital sex
* if you agree to have sex with a man, he'll still leave you but now no man will ever want to be with you
* Sex before marriage is wrong.  It's not ok to have dirty sex even in marriage.  Dirty sex is anything other than missionary





My fiancé and I were together for 11 months before having sex, and even before these classes I had always wanted to take things slow.  The problem, is that we rarely used condoms, and I would often forget the pill because ""they don't really work anyways, so why bother"".  We felt guilty, all the time.  Every new step we would take sexually I would feel more and more guilty about.  I knew I loved him, even early on, but at home at night and at church on Sundays I would feel dirty.  We finally got over it







The thing is, so she would let me go.  She tried explaining the truth about condoms and birth control to me but I told her she was wrong, because I believed that the school would make sure we got correct information, and that she was obviously misinformed.  She tried telling me sex was not dirty or anything to be ashamed of, so long as I was an adult and ready for it.  None of this stuck, because I got this talk after my first abstinence Ed class and first trip to camp (8th grade/summer before 9th grade) and she had the talk with me a few weeks before I started high school.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gvt0j/this_was_posted_in_my_dorm_dont_think_i_need_help/). 

I got [Anna Kay](http://i.imgur.com/YbNyt.jpg)

The workshop was led by two female NYU students. 9 people attended, I will share my experience.

The goal of the workshop was to promote masturbation as a form of safer sex. 
We had to fill in an [anonymous form](http://i.imgur.com/ms6Mb.jpg) about our experience with orgasms. There wasn’t anything too surprising there.

We played masturbation jeopardy where we learned the following things (again

**MYTH:**

* Some women are incapable of having an orgasm
* If you masturbate
* The inner lips of a woman's vulva are always smaller than the outter lips
* Masturbation is secondplace to partnered sex
* Researchers have found a definite existence the G-spot 

**FACT:**

* Masturbation is a free sleep aid and destresser
* Some women are capable of ejaculating fluid
* The average penis is 5 to 7 inches when aroused (and 3 to 4 when flacid)
* The typical length of the vaginal canal is 4 to 5 inches
* You can still masturbate if you have a partner

My team won (1800 to 1100). I won a stress-release ball.

Then we played [pin the tail](http://i.imgur.com/1F8CU.jpg) on the [sexual organ](http://i.imgur.com/OE8wk.jpg)... which was not too exciting.

They gave us a few tips on how to “get to know yourself” better:

* Relax
* Kegel exercises (using [vibratone balls](http://i.imgur.com/reaoD.jpg) for example)
* Sex toys: [helmet hugger](http://i.imgur.com/UUHLA.jpg) (masturbation sleeve for men)
* Communication is important
* Remember to be patient

I have been with my boyfriend (17) for two years and having sex for one. I would never tell my parents unless I was asking to be disowned after being grounded for life and lose all contact with civilization (half kidding). They would be so upset mad and disappointed in me since they've stressed abstinence for as long as I can remember. 

I had to do a lot of my learning through sites that's offer sex education because all my doctors always make it very clear I shouldn't be having sex until marriage and my mom refuses to let me go to a doctor visit alone so I have to lie to my doctor and I can never ask questions I have. Thank goodness for you guys! Otherwise I would be clueless. 

So here is the problem: I just got my second UTI in 6 months because I forgot to pee after sex. Shoot! I know it's an easy fix but it slipped my mind. I also masturbate a fair amount so that probably didn't help either. I asked my mom for a refill of my UTI prescription and she tried to get me to tell her I am sexually active. That's asking to get myself in deeeeep trouble so I told her that I hadn't showered in two days and I masterbate. She said its impossible to get a UTI in two days because she knows since she's had it. 

I'm afraid she's going to take me to a gyno and then she'll find out because she'll stay in the room and now I'm kind of stressed. Can a gyno tell of you're sexually active? Can I pass it off as masterbation, they're just crazy when it comes to that stuff. I'm Thor first child so they don't really know how to handle very thing very well when it comes to me.

Set-up was super easy. I used masking tape to hold the corners of the canvas to the plastic tarp, but the coconut oil caused it to come right off. The rest of our bodies was totally covered though, and it was amazing. Seeing my girlfriend's face streaked with black paint was like being attacked by an Amazonian woman. It was primal and sexy. We had fun hiding prints too. She made a couple boob/nipple prints that we can giggle about. Hand prints are more apparent, lol. The shower afterwards was a lot of fun too. Paint washed off without too much effort, but anytime we get to scrub each other down in the shower is a good time.

Although the city I was in *wasn't* famous for the skin trade, I'd be even less equipped to pick out a legitimate therapeutic place.

But next to the hotel there was a very legitimate *looking* shop.  The signs showed legitimate massage techniques

The masseuse seemed like a very nice girl

She actually did a pretty good job. She did my back and shoulders, just as I was mocking my own apprehensions about the place, poked me in the groin.  ""You want that massaged too?""

""Uh, plus a $4 tip -- and went back to my hotel.

Where I began to think about it.  Why not get the rest of me massaged?  It was a new experience and how bad could it be?   And the money was nothing.

So the next day, lay my face in the same hole in the same table.  Again I turned over to have my front worked on, and again she prodded me in the groin. ""You want that massaged too?""

This time, why not?""

$20.  No problem.  She had me stand up, lie down on the other bed in the room.  That bed wasn't as easily seen from the corridor, so maybe she wasn't supposed to be doing what she was doing.

And she set to it.  For someone who worked with her hands all day, that it didn't feel like much.  But a pretty girl was giving me a hand-job, that didn't happen to me every day.  And it occurred to me: maybe she'd let me touch her back.

So, but instead she unbuttoned her shirt for better access, and I reached inside.  Nice breast, but it isn't really exciting touching a boob of someone you don't know and isn't interested in you one way or another.

Well, and again she instantly loosened her belt and unzipped her shorts for my convenience.  Nice girl, honestly.

She had a fair patch of woolly pubic hair, in contrast to the sleek, glossy hair on her head, and the fact that she had it at all.  My only previous experience with sex workers was watching porn, and the performers there are always hairless as lizards from the neck down.  This was a distinct improvement.

But that was really it.  I'd never touched *unaroused* female genitalia before.  A woman's labia, slightly moist, tender to the touch, sensitive.  This girl's vulva was as cool and smooth as her hands, and as impersonal.

I should have just left.  I felt bad for the girl, I would have left, but just hopping up and exiting would cast aspersions on both her and me.  Just ejaculate already!

OK, right?  Imagine it's, oh, Katy Perry giving you the hand job, or Jewel.  And it's a blow job!  Mmmmm, no, that's not working.

Then of course, and get out of this place, before I gave this poor girl carpal-tunnel syndrome or she gave me penile calluses.  Pathetic as it was, I ended up fantasizing I was being jerked off by my wife.",,False,self,False,t3_spr62

I love women. I love their curves, her breasts, her shoulders, her neck, her hair. I love when it's clear she did some trimming or shaving that day in anticipation of what is about to happen.

I love when a woman openly communicates her lust to me. When she melts me with a smile, telling me how much she wants me. When she looks deep in to my eyes as she cups and fondles my balls while I grab a condom and roll it on.

I don't relate to guys who don't like going down on a woman. I love exploring. I love running my tongue through all the grooves, her upper body writhing as she tugs at my hair, her thighs quivering and squeezing against my ears and face. Her eyes closed or looking down at me. Even better if she straddles my head with her hands on the wall, slowly grinding herself against my face as my tongue snakes in and out and around. Bonus points for covering my face in splooshiness and/or making out with me right after.

I love when a woman lets me take control. I love stripping a woman down to her underwear and then picking her up, or standing and watching her as she kneels in front of me. I love to put her in the position I want and then have my way with her, then drag her to the next position and repeat. I love holding her wrists over her head during missionary and taking a deep handful of hair during doggy style and leaving a handprint on a luscious ass. I love waking her up the next morning with a hand between her legs while spooning, anxious for her to wake up and receive me again.

I love when a woman takes control. When she is *enthusiastic* and helps me

Sex adds colour to my world. I love pussy. I love women. I love sex. I am single.

1364564998.0,1b8ovn,My (27) bf (23) is too rough.,throwawayhardsex,584,163,307,"Exactly as the title says.  During sex my boyfriend just rubs too hard or he starts pounding away at me early.  I have guided his hands away from rubbing directly on my clit.  I have tried to explain and show him how much harder he is rubbing me than what would feel good.  I likened the pressure to me jerking him off with a crescent wrench.  I know he watches a lot of porn and I have told him that I just can't take what some of those girls can.

It has turned into a huge point of contention because he feels like I'm attacking or insulting him and he swears he's rubbing as soft as he can but I keep feeling like he is going for a deep tissue massage constantly (especially on my clit).  Then he doesn't want to have sex because I'm not just ready for him as instantly as he can be (due at least partially to the difference between men and women):  

I am his first sexual partner and I know he watches a lot of porn.  I've suggested that porn has warped his idea of sex but that is met with a lot of defense.   i casually brought up softcore (as cheesy as it is....there is still a lot more female foreplay than in hardcore) in hopes we could watch some of that together and maybe he could catch on without me being direct and causing him to put up a wall.

He's also a bit obsessed with me not being a virgin and wants to take my anal virginity so he ""has something"".

I should also mention that when we first became sexually active but before he cashed in his V card with me

I want to be with him but sex is becoming a hassle unless I just grin and pretend everything he is doing is just great.  Is this something we can overcome or is this an incompatibility?  What is within my means to make this better?

EDIT:  I admit he's immature but I don't want to break up with him.  His opposition is less ""I won't fix the problem"" and more ""I'm trying!"" but just not grasping why what he's doing is wrong.  It's like he can't control himself when he gets too worked up and doesn't understand why the stuff in porn isn't true to life.  I'm looking to show him why....not just tell him (since I've tried that and he feels cornered) that we both need to enjoy sex and for that to happen he has to take care.

I'm talking about [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1a2z1d/penis_goes_wrong_direction/), rather than the usual slight upward bend. This led to some pain, inconvenience, etc. and he and his girlfriend, his ""first real sexual partner"", were having trouble finding working positions and other solutions.

Kaliyugaa offered [this suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1a2z1d/penis_goes_wrong_direction/c8tmqca)

""Don't ask"" is something most people don't like hearing because it's momentarily frustrating and can sound a bit antagonistic or pretentious. In this case, the intention was pretty clearly not to antagonize or condescend. I understand the natural instinct to immediately want to know what someone says you can't know, but most mature people get over that instinct quickly in situations when it isn't appropriate. I don't mean that as a personal attack on the commenters in that thread but I truly am stunned that adults (probably) would act this way. Anyway, OP was downvoted heavily (I don't have RES; I'd be curious about the ratio) and the highest upvoted response to him was ""Well of course we're going to ask.""

OP responds ""very serious. can't talk about it. please."" and is downvoted even more heavily. Maybe I should care less about things on the internet but that made me sad and angry. Maybe he was downvoted for sounding a little melodramatic? Maybe it's that everyone still really wanted to know his secret? I don't know, a private, intimate subject, says he can't do something and can't say why, then asks to move on and *ends his post with ""please""*. I just don't get it.

The responses to that further dismissed his request and were largely immature. He explains ""that detail is unimportant and has to do with a mental trauma. and unrelated to my penis."" Even this response is downvoted to -5. A few responses to it, and a couple others.

Had it been a detail that was really relevant to the thread, despite there being a range of other advice that could have been offered outside of doggy style. I understand that most people on here aren't shy. They're very willing to discuss sex and sexuality in graphic terms and be forthcoming and descriptive. And that's a good thing. But not everyone is like that. And you can't expect everyone coming into the sub to be like that, at least not when the thing they aren't willing to talk about isn't important. I think it was teenage curiosity and nosiness that for some reason just wasn't checked at all. I understand wanting to know what someone says you can't know, but most people don't get stubborn about it.

Please consider this. I don't mean this to stir debate but if you have a counter-argument go for it. I would say regardless of your argument you should still respect people's feelings on what they're willing to discuss

I still can't believe someone was downvoted to -5 on this subreddit for sharing that his girlfriend had mental trauma related to sex. And downvoted to -26 for saying what he can't talk about.

First, and who hit puberty 4 years ago, and has lately been really interested in sex, as any 13 year old child would be.

There are two issues going on. 

First, nothing definite and I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. But she's upped the ante lately, and will do things like wear skimpy clothing and drape herself across me, or come into my office and start just massaging my shoulders or my scalp (like I do to her mom). The other night she hugged me goodnight and wrapped her legs around me and wouldn't let go (like ""haha, it's not sexual, so it's just silly and playful."" Right. Also bear in mind when picturing this that she has an extremely mature body and is often wolf whistled in public because she looks like a young adult.) When we're alone she'll ask random questions about what constitutes incest.

I think the signs are there and I think I'm not just seeing things. 

Here's the second problem though, was 32. It's just how I'm wired. All that having been said, once I started dealing with this months ago, I began having involuntary and intrusive sexual thoughts about my step daughter. They are extremely distressing, and I DO NOT WANT THEM. I would never, ever, ever, even if she were a legal adult

But I'm seeing this perfect storm of sexual interest brewing

I feel really trapped. Even writing this makes me nervous, and beyond horrified that I'm having the thoughts I'm having. I also don't want to humiliate my step daughter by calling it out directly, and there remains a chance that I really am just misinterpreting innocent actions and questions, and if I were to call it out, I'd be in deep shit.

truth be told

i don't know if it is just in my state, 20 weeks is the halfway point, so it's 1/2 way through the second trimester. the fetus is considered viable [able to take a breath] at the 21st week.)

now, to the point of lap sitting and inappropriate hugging/touching. (her biological mother abandoned her. it is not believed that she was sexually abused as a child... well, she's still a child, but you know what i mean. she was most probably mentally and/or physically abused.) she made me very uncomfortable when we first met. she and i have had talks about appropriate behavior at my sister-in-law's request. i also got used to some of it.

i ""can see"" how some of her actions could be misinterpreted by some men. (she only does this with older men. she is not even interested in boys her own age.) **but he is a grown man and she is 13-years-old!!**

okay, innocent kid who tries to do well in school and to please the parental figures in her life. she helps take care of her younger siblings and cooks diner for the whole family most nights, especially when my sister-i-law is working late... which is why there was a ""family friend"" sitting with them. 

i don't think she is mentally able to deal with an abortion; then again

edit: she is my brother-in-law's biological daughter who has lived with my wife's sister since she was 3-years-old when she was found alone in her home without supervision and full custody was granted to her father. so just to cleat up any confusion

second edit [8 hours later]: i do not mean make this sound like it is in any way, she is heavily leaning towards adoption. she does not think she can live with herself knowing that she took a life. this was her wording. we all agreed to help her weigh the decision without judgment or personal feelings about abortion. beyond that, most of the family is pro choice, and so this is her **choice**. my wife and i also had a very long talk tonight. part of the discussion was about the possibility of us adopting the child. we would talk to my niece first to ask if that would bother her. if she has any issue, we will drop that idea. but we have decided that **a)** since she puts so much on herself to take of her little brother and little sister and mom too (my sister-in-law has not been the most responsible person since her and my brother-in-law separated and he moved 2 hours away) and **b)** her mom would be unable to get her to school (all expectant mothers are sent to a ""special circumstances school"" and it is on the way to my son's middle school) and **c)** we have a spare room... our niece will most probably be living with us for the duration of her pregnancy. we will discuss it further with all involved tomorrow. also, as i am a stay-at-home dad for the moment, i will be home with her on days she is not up to attending school... something her mom could not do. right now, sister-in-law,False,

Then there was the time after a mid-day appointment where we snuck off to the house for a quick blowjob and cuddle.  A couple of other times

The best was a couple of nights ago… she dressed up like a schoolgirl and we role played, paddled her, and finished with fucking her, both vaginally and anally, on an air mattress in front of the fire.  It was awesome on so many levels.

Having this spot has added a great spark to an already strong marriage.

Now my wife wants to have sex with me all the time (at least once a day). Before this I had to beg her to make it happen twice a month. I am happy about the change but I feel like she was lying to me before when she said her low sex drive had nothing to do with my appearance.

My husband has high functioning autism / aspergers...
He is super smart and caring and compassionate.  He loves me very much.
We were dating for 4 years and everything was pretty normal.  It took a lot of effort for me to explain my emotions to him

During this time we had sex really regularly, he stopped having sex with me.  When I ask him about it, he said that it got boring. When I ask him, is there anything I can do about it he says that there is nothing I can do because he wants to have sex with a different body type.  He says that he needs sexual variety.  When I suggest role playing or doing things different, he says it is all boring.  It has been 6 months, and I feel used, I feel abandoned

Now he has come to me with the idea that he should be able to have sex with prostitutes while married to me.  I try to explain to him that, therefore I should feel special all the time.  I am really struggling to communicate my feelings and how he is hurting my feelings.  It is really doing a number on my ability to trust this person because I thought that he was having sex with me regularly as a way to express his affection for me. 

He feels that I am not doing enough to address the sexual variety problem. He thinks that I am not taking it seriously enough.

Anyway we are lying on my bed and she's giving me a handjob (my god she had skills) and after a reasonable amount of time I come. I'm going to attribute the girls skill to the rather impressive arc

Now for those of you fortunate enough to never have some man lava erupt into your eye let me tell you this shit burns. It burns like a bitch. I was freaking out she was freaking outand I'm running around my room one eye glued shut looking for something take the pain away. If you have ever seen a man with an erection running around in circles freaking out looking for a towel you don't need me to tell you that as this point the girls in stitches laughing her ass off at my plight. 

When I was all finished being a pussy she said ""remember that next time you ask a girl to come on her face.""

EDIT: Thanks for all the wonderful comments. My thinking is that making at least a couple people laugh is worth revisiting the horrors of that day. The girl is the one who called it the angry pirate hence the user name. For those who think its weird i was getting a hand job this girl is makes em better than most blowjobs. Go me.

EDIT 2: Wow guys this got a hell of a lot more views than I was expecting. A rather large amount of downvotes so I think I must have brought up some bad memories for a few people.

It all started with us trying to see who would cum first from 69. As I turned out too good for him we decided to up the ante and I allowed him access to a vibrator


Fast-forward a few weeks and I tried to get myself very close to an orgasm before I started blowing him. I took a psych class in college and obviously everyone knows about Pavlov's experiment so I thought why not. For about two or three months (yes


Now, feel, texture and motion of fellatio is enough to get me almost to the brink of orgasm. We're nearly getting there! Also note, this sometimes happens subconsciously. Just thinking about it and writing this down has already got me too excited.

1319528326.0,lo6hy,BJ tips and tricks from a gay guy,Volgin,722,316,195,"

My boyfriend had a hard time reaching orgasm during sex it took a while to get the right technique but this is how I get my guy to blow in 5 minutes flat:

* The easiest arrangement is laying side by side in a 69 position.
* The top and bottom parts of the glans where the ridge is are the most sensitive parts for most.
* Move only about one inch in and build up rhythm.
* Use the your tongue to push the glans into your palate.
* Pressure and friction from your tongue and palate will make him cum.
* Keep your lips very hard as teeth are distracting.
* Keep up a good speed and stop as little as possible (be relentless).
* Keep your mouth on it
* Suction doesn't help and makes loud noises.
* When he gets stiffer it means he is getting there
* When he shoots keep going until after the first two pulses then stop moving but keep pressure.
* Swish it around

Now if your neck hurts

Edit: my french is coming through gland = glans
