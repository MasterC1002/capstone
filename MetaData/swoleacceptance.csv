When I came in to work today he asked if I had a moment, probably from steroids. That what I'm doing is unhealthy and that I'm showing off my body to compensate for something.
 
It took me a few seconds to pick up my jaw from the floor.
 
I've had a few jokes thrown at me at the lunch table every now and then but they were always light hearted and funny (e.g. ""You can have my leftovers if you're still hungry after your third meal"") but this came straight out of nowhere. And showing off? I don't even wear V-Necks. We're an IT company so you can probably guess that a third of us is heavily obese and the rest is mostly skinny as hell and bordering on being underweight. And those are the people telling ME I'm living unhealthy and I'VE got a problem?!
 
I have never judged people by their appearance or their choices as I think it's nobody's business. But I guess it's too much to ask for the same right when you're not like the rest of the people around you.
 
I told my boss that I'm doing fine both mentally and physically and that I'm not on steroids. I explained to him that I'm currently bulking and that's why I'm eating the amount that I do. We got a bit caught up in this and I ended up going through my whole gym and diet routine as he was really interested. At the end he told me he thinks it's great that I'm working out and shouldn't let other people bother me. But he can't do anything about the badmouthing and thought I should know.

I don't remember how I got linked to this reddit, and it makes for a really enjoyable read. Seriously, you guys use the syllables ""bro"" and ""swole"" in ways I didn't think was possible. 

But let's be honest

Yes. Yes, that's why. Not only because you can squat a truck off the ground, but because you had found something you loved and were doing it. I can admire that (almost) no matter what you're doing. I also tried to put myself in your shoes for a second. It didn't take long for me to imagine some jackass thinking I was a douche, or some throwaway chick asking to see my abs, and it hit me that you guys actually probably do catch alot of flak just by being you. Well, wait a minute. That's not right, is it?

No, and that my opinion of those who make me look like a weak bitch has been changed.

So what to do about it. If I can't justify you being an asshole with no brain, I have to go to the gym, huh?

You'd think that'd be easy logic

Sooo, and asked him what to do to get started, how to lift safely, if any of the supplements are worth a damn, etc etc.. I leave for the gym as soon as I'm done typing this. It feels good to have a goal.

Even if I fail miserably, and being generally awesome.

**TL;DR: Keep being who you are. Keep doing what you're doing. Some guy on the internet thinks you're cool.**

**EDIT**: I a word. Also

**EDIT2**: Your comments are all great. I just went to the temple for the first time in years

I was feeling pretty good about myself when I was done

Thanks for your faith in me. Seriously. Not many people do that anymore.


**EDIT3**: Okay, every time I come back and read this it's like I have an army of spartans pushing me towards a better self. I'm going to print out this whole thread an put it on my wall because I swear I feel like I could rip a tree in half with my bare hands when I read it.

Then a couple days ago, Brodin came and comforted me - even though I had forsaken him. Today I returned to his temple, and indeed my gains had suffered as I thought they would. 5lb came off my bench press, 5lb off my deadlift and my OHP seemed much harder than before. 

During my final lift, then I looked down at the bar. I turned to my workout partner, my friend, and said ""I'm going to put more weight on this. I will channel all anger into this final set. Put more weight on yours as well bro."" I reached and added 10 pounds to the bar. This would be my PR, on a day when all other lifts had fallen and I was 5lb lighter. 

After loading the bar I looked at it dauntingly. I turned to my friend and said, straightened my back and whispered ""FUCK YOU!"", and lo and behold Brodin himself must have heard for the barbell flew from the ground and I repped it for 8! My friend smiled and congratulated me on this accomplishment.

By the time I arrive, “Those [my arms] are big!” and, “Can I see what you got under that shirt?” All the while being groped like a swoledabeast at the petting zoo.

I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my friends. I positioned them in front of me

At the bar I was subjected to the worst objectification I have ever experienced. I was sammiched between two young ladies that decided to use my forearms as shelves for their breasts. For Brodin’s sake

They told me that I looked like I had lots of stamina. This made me feel vindicated as I hard recently switched to a German high volume training routine. I felt it was about time someone noticed my lager calves. So I told them that I did indeed have plenty of stamina to get through any vigorous activity. They giggled

The bartender was swamped so I had to listen to them talk about how they were best friends and did *everything* together. My guess was that their favorite activity was swolehating. It finally came to an end when they asked me to take them back to their place. I’m not sure if being treated like a pony ride is a promotion from the petting zoo

After that I left. Just because I’m swole doesn’t mean I don’t have feelings. Why do people think it’s acceptable to treat me like an animal or piece of furniture? I’m not a human forklift that can be called on to move heavy objects. What can I do to make these feelings of shame go away?

Long have I struggled with finding a suitable squat form.  Too wide and my hip begins to pain me; too narrow and I do not hit depth.  Today, drove my head back into the bar and squatted, praying for Brodin's holy spot.  As my hip crease dropped behind my knees I expected a pang of pain.  Alas, there was none.  Holding myself in this squat, I 'mired in the mirror at what had occurred.  I had gone as deep as I was humanly capable of dropping with not an ounce of pain.  Rocketing out off the hole, I repeated this for 10x3, as the Prophet Brolov commanded.

Leaving the temple I dwelt upon what had occurred.  My one lesson to a young swole was favored by our Lord and Broviour and in return I was granted a token of his appreciation.

And if your clients are bothered by the noise of plates knocking together

And until you stop referring to your establishment as a ""Gym"" I will continue you to use it like one. 

The statement delivered to my Brother and I during a PR shattering leg day really got me thinking about the state of Gyms where I live. 

It struck me that more and more space was dedicated to half empty studios

A treadmill could break down and be replaced within a week

Gyms in and around London seem to be on a slippery slope away from a temple inclusivity, the worshipers of the ab crunch machine and the gel-haired bicep curling poppin-jays who assess themselves from all angles in a mirror after each pendulously swung rep.  

As evidenced by the cavernous areas dedicated to rows upon rows of treadmills

Out of the four gyms in my locale

Like Wrestling - the original Olympic sport - is being stricken from the Olympics

What follows is a race to the bottom. A committees opinion of what a Gym should be to attract all manner of fence sitting and under-motivated people. The £45 a month from uncertain person who might sign up for the month of January carries more weight than the £45 a month from the person who is - and has been - in there four days a week. 

Offering a range of activities and facilities is noble. The fact that there is a ladies only space is more so. Opening the door for people and offering them the comfort of their own sex is a wonderfully inclusive thing. Especially as it opens the door for people who would be kept away from their own idea of perfecta forma on religious grounds. 

But if opening the door for one demographic means shutting the door on the original demographic

Ditch the squat rack

Ditch the bench

Ditch the olympic bars. If people want to Deadlift

If you take the weights out of a gym

A wellness centre? A convalescent home? 

""We don't have a weights area sir

""Or perhaps you'd rather the ""Get in shape for your mistress"" deal? £45 a month

If it is to be that way

But in the mean time

I work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a ""bar"" where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements. I normally just bring my own

We slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order

Now I have been working out at this gym for a few months, and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable. I'm not saying he doesn't use them for sure, but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated, I am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work.

She finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins. The employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably *very* important phone call. That's when I catch it

If you don't know much about fitness supplements, but probably ~400 calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been. Judging by how small this woman was, those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get, but not too much to gain much extra weight... If he keeps this up, she will sit comfortably for the remainder of the summer prep time at the exact same weight completely confused as to why her efforts just aren't cutting it.

Just as he turned around to hand it to her he caught my eye and froze. I just gave him a wink

The lifters there suffer from ignorance, DYELs, and a couple of crossfitters that I see on a regular basis.

Sometime 2 weeks ago there was a new face in the crowd. He was probably only a year or two younger than me, I had the intention of using it to do some heavy push press and OHPs. I asked him if he wouldn't mind me working in, and he didn't. He moved his set up a few feet back where he then proceeded to deadlift.

He was struggling pretty badly

I was taking a quick rest in between sets when he asked me if I know how to deadlift and if I could assist him. He listened well and improved his form greatly.

Fast forward to Saturday

It stops now. But first

Now, but that's not my style. I created it as a satirical sub to parody /r/BodyAcceptance but it soon evolved- because of it's users- into what it is today. 

Today /r/swoleacceptance belongs to you

The user who created /r/SwoleDominance isn't even *that* swole. Who is he to stand above all of you, let us judge him...

He's been training for **1 whole year!!!** Yay! He started on New Years day as it was his resolution. Yes

I know, there's more.

He weighs in at 205 and has the following maxes:

Squat- 335

Bench- 305

Deadlift- 485

Wilks- 320.565

Those are in pounds

I'll give you all a second to laugh...

/u/thorbreakbeatgod you're a joke man. You've created a subreddit that serves one purpose

Being swole isn't just about how much you can lift brother. 

Being swole is many things. *But judging those who are trying to become swole isn't one of them.* You aren't swole. Sure you lift. Sure you might even look like you ""do even lift."" But the prickish behavior that you've exemplified in the last few weeks shows that your subreddit /r/SwoleDominance exists as Germany did in 1940 and you're literally Hitler persecuting *the truly swole* because you have some insecurity within- maybe the fact that you know yourself to lack swole. Seriously

This isn't me judging you /u/thorbreakbeatgod

For the love of Brodin man, but **my wilks is nearly 100 points higher than yours!** Want to go judging others now? Oh, how about in my first powerlifting meet I totalled 1,113 lb in the 148 lb class. My wilks then was 395. Which is still much much MUCH higher than what you currently have!

Who are you to stand in judgement of others when the reality is you've accomplished very little? And what you have accomplished is marred by your poor attitude and treatment of others. 

I could go on and on about the many things I've accomplished in my life. I could talk at great length about how much better than you I am... but that's not the kind of person I am. All I was trying to do was make a point

So I'll stop here. I'm sure you understand the stupidity of your immaturity now and how un-swole your actions are. 

What I really want you to understand is this- Strength isn't just about how much weight you can lift in the gym...

*It's about who you can lift up so that they can become stronger than you.*

You've invited me to become a moderator of /r/SwoleDominance and I accept that. Likewise

I'm going to learn, as a moderator of /r/swoleacceptance. 

But should you continue down the path of inner weakness your privileges will be revoked

I'm going to mentor you so that one day you can stand on a platform as a champion, mentally, and spiritually. The holy trinity of swolitude.

It is with great sadness that I relay this story. What you read in the title is true. Not a few weeks past, there were no Disciples of Brodin (other than myself.) But it would seem that my singular swole presence would become my undoing.


I attended this party for entertainment, and I left in peace.



Or so I thought. It would come to my attention later that week that rumors were rising about my actions at said party—specifically related to one couple. Indeed, were he to answer Brodin’s call. They gave the impression that they were one of those couples of weak-will—made up of two people swole of pride but not of communicatory skills. Perhaps if they learned to squat deeper, they could stoop down and meet on each other's level. 


I later found out that the woman in this couple had been telling her boyfriend, I come to you honestly and say that no such actions occurred. To make things worse, I received this news on leg day—when I was already at my weakest. And then this. I suspect that I was singled out because of my swole. As I said, I was the only attendee who has paid his homage to the Iron Temple. I believe that I was seen as a mere object of physical attraction—an arrangement of muscles, nothing more. Well, she forgot about my biggest muscle: my heart, which now feels heavier than any squat ever could.

The fat are judged for their sloth. The rich are judged for their greed. The beautiful are judged for their vanity. We swole

Some attempt to tear us down, we rebuild. With our strength we persevere. With our iron will we continue our march and weather the storm that is violent with jealousy, revulsion, and contempt. 

I, some observances, while others are rules that we swoles will adhere to while in this most strong and disciplined community. 

First, our community as a whole has gained some earned responsibility. Which leads me to the only rule I am laying down. This rule has been agreed upon by the moderators of this subreddit. Break this rule and you break faith with this community and you pour Brodin's protein shake upon the gym floor. Pledge with me, and our mods, to adhere to this rule. If you decide not to, please unsubscribe now and forever hold your dumbbells in solitude; away from your brothers and sisters in swole. 

**The Swole Acceptance Pledge** 

The swoldiers of this community will not rally other swoles to attack a post outside our walls! We will not undermine our mental and physical strength by becoming a downvote army. A swole does not downvote without discourse! No more crossposting of swole hate done in efforts to bury ignorance. That is not how a swole fights! Crossposting is fine as long as we attempt to properly educate the ignorant. Fail to do this and the post will be deleted here and the user banned. *That is the golden rule of Swole Acceptance.* Break it and you dishonor the swole. You shame us and yourself. We will cast you out into the weakness. 

Brothers and sisters, and numbers. Should we use our strength for perverse personal gain we gain nothing but perversion. Being swole is about gains, and we want quality gains! 

I have observed, letting go of your proverbial bike seat and I watched you like a proud father ride true. In each new post you turned the crank and propelled Swole Acceptance further into the greatness it has become. Today we stand together. Individually strong and stronger collectively than we could ever become individually. Beside each other we form an inpenetrable phalanx of muscle and brawn. There is no other community like us! Brothers and sisters I raise my shaker of muscle brew to you, for on this day, I see the greatness you have become. 

On Brodin. Some view him as real as the man squatting in the rack next to you. Others view him as a man above, they too are correct. But how can this be? Well swole nation, because Brodin in any form is strength, and like I said before, together we are strong. *Together we are Brodin.*

The last topic I would like to speak on is about privilege

The first rule of battle is to know your enemy. Know this swoldiers

First attempt to be a lifting partner. If that course of action shall fail you then proceed to educate forcefully. We should not fear to use our strength but should fear the improper use of it. 

Once again swole brothers and sisters I thank you for your participation in this community. I thank you for your up curls, gains, hypertrophy, vascularity, and more protein sources than you've ever imagined!

I declared my major in kinesiology and my passion and profession were becoming one. I gave my all in pursuit of swole, and now it is being stripped from me.

I have been getting tests done on my heart since I was a child. My mother died at 24 from extremely rare form of mitral valve prolapse. Her brother died a few years before her at 22 from an extreme arrythmia and his autopsy revealed that he had coronary artery disease. Both of them were extremely fit. My mother was an all american soccer player and my uncle was in the military.

In July they discovered via ultrasound that my left and right ventricles were enlarged and that I have low functioning in both of them. I also have arrythmia that comes and goes randomly. My cardiac MRI done at the beginning of this month concerned my cardiologist quite a bit. I exhibit early warning signs of cardiomyopathy as well as a few other things. They believe it to be genetic, I am to refrain from all physical activity except for mild walking, bowling and golf for at least the next 6-8 weeks. Because, all of the bad things that could happen to me could be brought on by the increased cardiovascular function during exercise.

Fast forward 15 minutes and a couple punks walked in. (mind you I am not large in stature, 5'7"") and they were a little bigger than me. They began making snide comments at him quietly and I held back my rage for a while, then one of them dropped this gem; ""he's only squatting that much cause he's retarded"" and then they proceeded to laugh. I couldn't hold my rage any longer. I dropped my massive bar on the ground and walked over to him and, very passively stated; ""If you say one more negative word about him or anything he's doing you're going to have a bad night."" he replied ""Oh really? What's going to happen?"" and again very passively i said ""you will be carried out of this gym by your buddy with fucking head trauma"" a larger swole brother came up behind me and said ""guys, how about you fuck off?"" obviously intimidated by my new swole brother and perhaps even me a bit, they sulked out of the gym frowning.

To start off, weight wise.  However, for my adult life so far, I was sorely out of shape.  Many complimented my thinness, but I did not care for my stick arms and legs.  I tried cardio to perfect my physique, but it did little.  

During this time, I feared His disciples.  I mistook the prayers of the faithful to be the bellowing of animals.  I shied away from the air that felt clogged with testosterone.  I could practically see the words painted above the door of his swolliest of temples: No Girls Allowed.  

I resisted for some time before I took Brodin into my heart.  Through the inspiration of ironsister Jamie Eason, so that I could sequester myself in prayer at night, away from judging eyes.  Normally I would be one of two or three in the temple, and we all would pray in solitude.  After some time there, I decided to learn my max squat.  I began loading plates, pushing my sins up from the mats, thanking the patron goddess of swole, for accepting my penance.

I was approaching my max, and psyched myself up.  I can do this this through Brodin who strengthens me.  I lifted the bar from the rack, and descended.  The gods, they tested me.  I struggled to push my sins back up, but I did!  I placed the sacred bar back upon the rack and caught my breath.

It was about here that I looked up and met the eyes of one of the other faithful.  This brother has obviously followed the Tao of Iron for much of his life.  Brodin has blessed him with many gainz, he gave me a single nod.  As if to say ""nice one.""  It was exactly what I needed.  I did not need nor want a clap on the shoulder, a loud cheer, or even a ""good job"" out loud, as I am still bashful.  My heart swelled with joy at this acknowledgement from a gifted ironbrother.  There is indeed a place for a skinny chick on the path to swole.  This was many moons ago, and I have continued my devotions since.

May the Swoly bless you with many gainz.

1) Make giant protein shake with oats
2) Lay on floor - I move as little as possible for maximum recovery and gains

I worked at a pizza shop in small town USA. Half of my coworkers were obese. Started lifting and eating clean two years ago. First year I did a lot of cardio as well. Got made fun of a lot for bringing bag lunches to work instead of buying pizza for myself. Earned the nicknames ""lance"" and ""greek yogurt boy"". Became my boss's bitch for any task that was physically demanding. No big deal though.

2012 was the year a lot of people started quitting because our boss's personality was rapidly changing and she wasn't doing her job. She was known to randomly go off on people and attack their personalities, so you were always doing the work of two or three people and getting shit on when you couldn't keep up. Nasty place to work.

I was the kind of person who kept quiet and did my job, like leaving company pens on the ground in the parking lot, or rolling my eyes. If I ever tried to defend myself, people would say ""wow, someone's moody today"", or they would straight up accuse me of roid rage. At that time I didn't think they really meant it, I didn't have the body of a steroid user

Last August, ""Wow, so my dad asked me today if I was juicing. Weird."" .   All of the comments from my friends were totally benign things like ""Bulk so hard mothafuckas wanna test me"" and ""Haha your dad's such a character.""

What I didn't know was that my boss was e-stalking me and reading all of my posts. The next day at work, I noticed my coworkers becoming increasingly hostile towards me. At one point, we were busy and I asked a coworker to stop texting his girlfriend, and he asked me to stop jabbing needles in my ass. Went home that night feeling weird and confused. How was I going to bring this up with my boss without her accusing me of being moody? Should I call the franchise office and complain to the district manager? Will they laugh at me and think I'm just a self-obsessed tool?

Two days later I was back at work, towards the end of my shift out of the blue she says, ""So I read that your dad called you out about your steroid usage"".  I was expecting this conversation to come up, but the way she worded it really caught me off guard. ""My steroid usage?"" I asked. She chuckled to herself. Keep in mind that I was in the kitchen making a long list of orders while she was talking to me from her office chair, pretending to do paperwork.

""You know how everyone here knows?""

""Knows what?""

""It's actually not because of the big muscles. It's because of your personality. Your moods. Your short attention span. All the mistakes you make. It's obvious.""  

 She then immediately shut the office door and locked it

I don't even know how to describe how I felt at that moment. I'm 22, and to some religious McDonald's-eating slob that makes me a steroid-abusing douche. None of the things she said were even true. I'm calm,  I'm always nice to everyone, and I work my ass off. She was projecting those things onto me in order to validate her own misinformed ideas. I don't think I've ever felt more insulted, more degraded, more shat on in my entire life. I knew right then and there, I couldn't work another day at that shitty restaurant. I felt something inside me physically snap, I took a couple customer phone calls, when my shift is over, CHRIS. WHY?""  It was Brenda

""Well then, and that I couldn't handle working with Brenda anymore. He said, ""Good on you man. Maybe someday I'll have the balls to do the same"".

The name of the elder of these brothers was Brometheus. Brometheus was always thinking of improving and setting new PRs. He wished to spread the word of improvement to the world. Brometheus did not want to live amongst the Gods of Iron on Mount Broylmpus.  He was too busy for that.  The gods were spending their time lifting, wishing to inflate their ego with each rep. However, Brometheus was planning how to make the world stronger and better than it had ever been before.
  
So instead of living on Broylmpus, was king.   He found them living by the Crossfit and cardio. They were hunted by wild beasts, and while humans had strong hearts, they could not fight back. ""If they only had Iron,"" said Brometheus to himself, ""they could at least fight the beasts and make gains; and after a while they could learn to make their own Iron and build themselves “gymnasiums”.  Without Iron, they are worse off than the weak privileged.""Brometheus went boldly to Brodin and begged him to give Iron to the people, ""Not one plate will I share with them!  For if men had Iron they might become strong and wise like us, and he did not give up.

  As he was walking by the seashore he found a sea snail. He saw that such a small soft creature,"" he said to himself.  And with that thought, he snuck quietly into Brodin’s domain and stole two plates from Brodin’s own rack.  Brometheus securely strapped the plates to his back and hurried back to his own land, carrying with him the precious plates on his back.
  
When he reached home, and bench press. He showed them the food with which to make gains. Men and women gathered round the rack and were happy and filled with new strength, and thankful to Brometheus for the wonderful gift which he had brought to them.One evening, Brodin gazed down from Mount Broylmpus and noticed men and women lifting happily in every village across the land.  It did not take him long to realize that Brometheus had disobeyed him and given Iron to men.
  
Brodin was very angry and ordered that Brometheus be pinned under the mightiest of bars.  And there Brometheus stayed, men and women of the earth were strong, and they were ‘mired across the land by man and beast alike. They decided to thank Brometheus at the heights of Brolympus. As the people ascended, they heard a most saddening noise just outside the Temple atop the mountain. It was their savior, Brometheus, held down by a bar so mighty that no man can lift it. Brodin saw the humans climb the mountain, and was angered and jealous of the gains they acquired. He saw them gather around Brometheus. His prisoner would not have the luxury of company! As Brodin approached the unforgiving bench, one on each side of the bar. Brodin hid himself and chuckled to himself. Perhaps this will teach those humans not to tread in the domain of gods. The humans approached the bar and gripped it. As they lifted, the weights rose. The bar was lifted, the humans and Brometheus lifted again
  
“Enough! I have seen enough!” Brodin himself emerged from his cover and strode toward the humans and prisoner. “Why do you wish to free this man? He has wronged the gods, but we fight them. We use our cardio not to run, but hunt. We have fullness about our hearts. We feel complete both physically and mentally. Our PRs may not be as mighty as yours of the other gods, but that is not what is important.” “This concept confounds me” Brodin stated. “If not to lift the heaviest weight, then why lift?” The young man replied, “To improve. It does not matter where you are, but how far you’ve come. The iron tests us and our dedication, and the rest followed suit. Brodin watched on as the humans attempted again to raise the bar. Failure was wrought on their faces
  
He once again gazed on the humans’ struggle. The more he looked on, so dedicated and focused, did not notice. With an exhale and mighty pull, the bar was raised higher and higher until Bromethius was able to excape. Before Brometheus could thank the humans, Brodin stood and stared down and the humans and demigod.
  
“Forgive me. I thought all was the Iron and body. But I have experienced a new PR. I am now aware of the transformations of the heart and mind, but your mind and heart are truly mighty. Your state shall be known as trans-swole, and it will be honored, as those who wish to change their weak bodies to strong ones are truly righteous if their commitment to the Iron is true. Pray to me at the Iron Temple and I will bless your reps. Worship me with righteous meals and I will bless you with gains. Wheymen.” With this, Brodin turned and left the Brometheus and headed to the Temple atop Mount Brolympus. It was time for a change.",,False,t5_2u673,True

Yea

This day

With my prescribed sets completed and my posterior chain firing like the engine of a finely tuned Bugatti Veyron

Suddenly

A massive hand with calluses 10 feet thick ripped open the roof of the gym and I stood there eye to eye with The Ripped One Himself

His fiery gaze shot towards the corner of the gym where a loaded bar lie with 2 plates per side. Without needing to say a word

315.

405.

495.

The winds howled and lightning began to strike around me as my triples got heavier. The weights flew off the ground as if to thank me for liberating them from their earthly prison. My spinal erectors began to swell to the point of swallowing my shirt in a glorious mooseknuckle of swolitude.

The skies erupted in an abusive torrent of rain as I loaded up 585 and pulled it with the ease of a greasy dump after a night of drinking Jagermeister and prune juice cocktails.

Then the decision.

Do I stop there? Or try to best my personal record of 685? And if so

I loaded my final plates. The wind screamed and began to blow smaller pieces of equipment out of Santa Clara County. Illegitimate fagit pretenders who were hiding behind the Smith machine were swept away and destroyed by righteous lightning bolts cast from what remained visible of the ends of the barbell. 

I approached the bar with the same mentality as a base jumper approaches the edge of a cliff. Full commitment. No going back now.

With the memories of a thousand of life's failures spinning through my head like an F5 tornado through an abandoned trailer park

I drew in my last breath as a boy and began to press my abs out against my belt. The bar floated off the ground as I squeezed my quads.

Past the shins.

To the knees.

This is where I've stalled out before; that transition from the quads to the low back. But the snatch grip deadlifts I've been doing to prepare my upper back for this moment.

We do our utmost to lower the weight gently and also pack yoga matts under the weights to minimize noise

That followed a rather rough few months in our gym which recently changed ownership and drew the kind of loud

The reprimand we received went nowhere and ultimately stoked up the ire we felt for the gym. I was back in on the Bank Holiday monday to get a brilliant leg pump before heading out for a spot of touch rugby and a pub garden session to celebrate the British Summer. 

When I got there, he launched into a set of farmers walks.

I finish my squats and I start to re-rack the weights when he asks me to leave 60kg on the bar. Fair play

I start on my calf raise set on the smith and work through them quickly

I'm racking up 60kg to warm up on my deadlift set and I get a tap on the shoulder. Gym manager with a couple of 20kg plates returning the favour. He thanks me for hooking him up with the 20 on his squat and asks if he can cut in. 

So we work our way up

I said to him during ""According to a member of your staff

He also brought up the fact that he's seen myself and my brother re-racking weights and returning dumbells that people have left around the place when we're in between sets. He said the fact that we put weights back is amazing in itself

The long and the short of it is, and they want maximum profits. He'd also like to hire an extra member of staff to keep the place tidy, but again, maximum profits. And the fact is, the staff shouldn't have to pick up after people. 

We joked about having certain minimum requirements

He asked me why I felt the need to tidy up after others. I couldn't give him a clear answer. I want the room, I'm part of that dying breed of gym goer who isn't afraid to work hard and lift something. 

We solidified our newfound respect with a deadlift of 160kg. My first.

Brojectivism is most famously explained in the book Atlas Shrugged; a swoleosophical fictional novel about trap gains. 

In the book, and even all the gainz were distributed equally among all people, regardless of the amount of effort put in at the temple. They thought that if everyone was weak, then everyone was strong.

In an attempt to escape the swolehate, perfect swoleciety. 

One of the main ideals of brojectivism is the pursuit of ones own swole. Brojectivists believe that one should only focus on his own swole, or helping newbies with their gains. 

Critics of brojectivism claim that brojectivists are selfish and swoledominant

I was reminded of a tale from Brodin that went: ""Brodin entered the Temple area and drove out all who were crossfitting He overturned the mats of the weak priveleged and the benches of those doing body weight exercises. 'It is written

Yet I walked in, lifting a mere 5-10 pounds on cables. I yearn to lift and grow swole again like I was before, yet my doctor (a swole ally) insisted I lay off my insistent worship of the iron, so as to not injure myself again, and one day regain my figure that pleased brodin so much. 

The weak privileged might not have recognized my swole, that doesn't do anything, thats useless"" I was shocked. Curls I thought, one of our foundations, how can he say this blasphemy. I looked around and saw the worse sacrilege of all though, poor form. These crossfitters could not execute a proper push up, or a decent squat, yet no.

I took some time to read your posts, being swole is not just a hobby, not just a temporary endeavour, it's a life long commitment to become the best you can possibly be. I realised i was just like you, though not in wanting to be swole (because i am possibly the anti-swole). I'm an artist, and wile it seems to some people like its just a hobby i keep next to my univerity studies, i know that i could never stop being an artist. I realise now that it would be just as impossible for you to just decide to stop working out as it would be for me to stop being an artist or to stop being gay.

I cant remember how many times people have told me how useless being an artist is. How many times i was picked on for not joining football, and i know how it feels. The challenges we face aren't exact parallels, but i feel i understand nonetheless.

Watch her as she manages to live day by day on the razor blade line between the “that's-cute” dismissal and the “she-must-be-violent” fear. But you know the path she seeks. You know the pain that bursts forth from weak-minded insults

Date her because one day, and you will have gained a woman who will remember that she is your spotter in life and in death, in sickness and in health. You will have gained a woman who will have the strength to put away anger, fear, doubts, and the ghosts of past fights to protect you while the bar is in your grip alone. In this time her only goal is your well-being. As you spot each other at the bar, so you will fall in love anew each day. Date her because she will understand the red face, the sweat. Date her because, cheering loudly for the next 2.5lb increases.

Date her because a woman who lifts knows how to release stress, and in her own body. She has built a temple of slow progress and rational thought. She understands how, in an oft cruel and misled world, the temple of Brodin is open to all who are reasonable about their expectations at the bar. The temple will not mislead or chide, it will state firmly where you are and where you have yet to reach. The doors to the temple of iron are always open. As our saint Rollins hath said “the iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver”. Date a girl who has come to realize this, and in her you will find open doors of communication often locked in others.

Most importantly, has offered a part of herself unto the temple of Brodin. She will not hurt you if the bounty of your gains be great or small. She will offer no daggers of weak-minded hatred, only understanding of what will come tomorrow. Date her because she will offer you respite from the weak-minded in your life.

I was 7 when I discovered that you were swole, just like a movie star. Whenever I had the chance I’d pull out that wondrous white bathing suit hidden in your bottom drawer and imagine a time when I’d be big enough to wear it; when I’d be like you.

But all of that changed when, ‘‘Look at you, so thin, beautiful, and lovely. And look at me, swole, ugly

At first I didn’t understand what you meant.

‘‘You’re not swole, ‘‘Yes I am, darling. I’ve always been swole; even as a child.’’

In the days that followed I had some painful revelations that have shaped my whole life. I learned that:

1. You must be swole because fathers don’t lie.
2. Swole is ugly and horrible.
3. When I grow up I’ll look like you and therefore I will be swole

Years later, and unworthy. Because, as my first and most influential role model, you taught me to believe the same thing about myself.

With every grimace at your reflection in the mirror,’’ I learned that men must be thin to be valid and worthy. Men must go without because their greatest contribution to the world is their physical beauty.

Just like you

But now that I am older

Look at the example Granddad set for you. Despite being what could only be described as otter-mode

I remember his ‘‘compassionate’’ response when you announced that Mum had left you for another man. His first comment was, but not that much.’’

Before Mum left

‘‘Jesus

That night at dinner I watched you implement Mum's ‘‘Energy In, Just Eat Less’’ weight-loss cure. You served up chow mein for dinner. Everyone else’s food was on a dinner plate except yours. You served your chow mein on a tiny bread-and-butter plate.

As you sat in front of that pathetic scoop of mince

It broke my heart to witness your despair and I’m sorry that I didn’t rush to your defense. I’d already learned that it was your fault that you were swole. I’d even heard Mum describe losing muscle as a ‘‘simple’’ process—yet one that you still couldn’t come to grips with. The lesson: You didn’t deserve any weights and you certainly didn’t deserve any sympathy.

But I was wrong

But this madness has to stop, and it stops now. We deserve better—better than to have our days brought to ruin by bad body thoughts, wishing we were otherwise.

And it’s not just about you and me anymore. It’s also about Bob. Your grandson is only 3 and I do not want swole hatred to take root inside him and strangle his happiness, we need to be the best role models we can be. We need to show him with our words and our actions that men are good enough just the way they are. And for him to believe us, we need to believe it ourselves.

The older we get

Your body is perfect too. It allows you to disarm a room with your pecs and infect everyone with your traps. It gives you arms to wrap around Bob and squeeze him until he passes out. Every moment we spend worrying about our physical ‘‘flaws’’ is a moment wasted

Let us honor and respect our bodies for what they do instead of despising them for how they appear. Focus on living healthy and active lives, my innocent young eyes saw the truth. I saw unconditional love, beauty, and wisdom. I saw my Dad.

My regular GP recently retired and blessed be Brodins will I have remained free from illness or injury until very recently. 

I hurt my back whilst training in the iron temple ( how I do not know as my form was good and had not yet reached max weight) went to a new clinic in town and the doctor sent me off for x rays etc no problems. 
So when I needed a medical clearance for a fitness test I have coming up I sought his assistance in filling this parchment. All that was required was clearance to complete a beep test

So I sit down and explain the situation and the job I'm applying for he does my blood pressure - which ended up being slightly high - and he looks me up and down and says ""does thou partake in protein and supplements?"" So I answer truthfully that I do indeed take protein and supplements so as to help with most holy of gainz. He then sighs and says ""it will give you brain damage, I may even start you on medication for the blood pressure""

He suggested I should reduce my ""muscle mass"" and attempt a more cardio approach to fitness that doesn't require being so ""bulky and rely on supplements"" 
Truly brothers I am at a loss for it will affect my clearance as it will be recorded I changed GPs. 

TL;DR : doctor said ill get brain damage for being swole and to seek otter mode.

Edit - I'm not hating on the fact that he told me to lose weight guys. Sheesh. For a swole community you all sound like you've never carried around any extra fat. There was a post two days ago about people seeking bear mode or strong fat. Apparently that thread was lies as when someone of that nature appears here I've been down voted and abused. I was more concerned with the information he gave me about using protein causing brain damage and the lecture I got about doing weights.  Y'all need to chill out a bit

We were not one set deep when a member of staff rushed in and told us that their facilities weren't set up for such a dangerous routine. My statement that I had performed this routine for months up until this gym changed ownership was met with a shrug. The facilities in the weights area had so far not changed. I suggested that he check with a manager. 

We were then approached by a perma-tanned and top heavy PT who tried to talk us out of doing Power Cleans

I thanked him for his advice but told him that his frame was not my goal. 

Exhibit C) 

On tuesday morning I arrived at opening time and was again met with a chaotic weights area and surly staff. One other disciple was up through the changing room doors thirty seconds before me, we were told saturday. We plan on speaking to him then. 

Exhibit E) 

Tuesday evening. A valiant looking man wrenched the bar from the squat rack and set up a 90KG deadlift. ""At last!"" I thought, leaving the stacked bar adrift amidst a sea of discarded dumbbells and barbells. 

The PT from sunday evening came up and set up the E-Z bar for curls. Once he'd hit fatigue he dropped it and returned to the front desk. 

**TL;DR** My once glorious gym, the clientele has suddenly shifted from friendly and considerate lifters who take pride in the gym to barbarians who seemingly stop their routine randomly, leave their weights were they stood and saunter off. As if they've received some kind of higher calling, or as if they expect their parents to pick up after them.

5.) Thou shalt clean thy own sweat if left on equipment.

7.) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's muscles.

My close non-Brodinist friends make jokes but at the end of the day they respect what I do and it's really just in good fun. But yesterday I encountered some serious swole hate. 

**The Backstory**:
I'm part of a powerlifting group. We're local guys that came together in my friends basement and we basically started from the ground up; a scarcely filled dumbbell rack, and we own one of maybe three or four monolifts in our state, a legit powerlifting bench, deadlift platform, more dumbbells than you can shake a stick at, over 1,000 lbs in plates, and a group-wide determination that has propelled us to where we are now

**The Swole Hate**:
Now, Topix is an anonymous forum that allows anybody to post anything about anybody or topic, and almost every city/town has a Topix forum. In this local post, our group was called ""douchebags"", ""bear gays"" multiple times, and one even said that it was pathetic that we spent so much time on our bodies. Here are a few excerpts: 

*&gt; Biggest F'n douchebags in town. Seriously.

*&gt; They think everyone wants to be like them and be in they're bear gay club lol they wrong

*&gt; I think they all are gay anytime a man spends that much time on his body is pathetic

*&gt; Its a local weight lifting club you can only be a member if your a bear gay. they support gay rights movements is why. Traveling the country competing in weight lifting events proving to the world that gays are just as strong as straight men. Pretty courageous and brave if you ask me.

*&gt; I think they are a bunch of steroid shooting fags! It seems that they are more turned on by their bodies and there friends bodies than they are women. They are all the time rubbing on each other and looking at each other in the mirrors. I'm all for lifting weights and taking care of your body but these guys are just pathetic. I would bet money that every damn one of them are on steroids and will die of heart attacks by the time they are 50 years old if not sooner. Bunch of beefed up bear gays doing each other in the ass bare back is what I would say is really going on behind closed doors lol.

I laughed, cool to be around, and have no problems with us. It's just mind boggling. These people have clearly never been around us, yet hate us like we've burned their houses down, raped their women, and enslaved their children.

But I'm still going to rep my gym with pride. I'm still going to wear my gym logo shirt and anybody that wants to put a target on it is more than welcome to. I live by the motto that I saw on here a few weeks ago

They were a doing some weird ass gymnastics-esque pull-ups on in the squat rack (the rack does have some handles for doing pullup) but there are 2 other places in the gym to be doing pullups besides the squat rack. I ignored it and went on my way. I get to the free weight room and they go in there using ALL the barbells to do some stupid ass pushpresssquatcleandeadliftslunges. Whatever, and have the other in my hand. These guys run out of the free weight room and put some wierd-ass straps on the cable machine and start to do some bullshit ab routine while I'm hooking up the handles. What they were doing had nothing to do with the machine. I looked directly at them and said ""Hey, I'm on this right now, ill be done in less than 5 minutes."" I was trying to be polite, I had gotten there first. They looked at me like I had spoken in a foreign language to them and muttered as they walked away to do their gymnastics else where.

This bothered me because I noticed that during the deep portion of the squat

I could see only one set of footprints.

In the last three days I have had two encounters with ""members"" at my gym that have me questioning their reasons for being at my temple. 

Incident 1 (Saturday): As I am going about doing my workout and having a great time doing it before a nice dinner out; I am approached by a fellow worshiper (or so I thought) and asked if I could help them with their dead lifting form. They stated that they have noticed I put up a lot of weight and want to do the same. I love teaching so I oblige them
  So we begin, but not bad for someone that is probably in their first year of real lifting. I give them some pointers and tell them rest and do another set. They do another and their form improved a lot. I tell them to now add the weight they wish to do and we'll go again. Now this is where it went down hill. They do their set and instantly start complaining about how the bar hurts their hands, that their back is going to be sore, and how they thought going to the gym would be easy (in the tone of a small child). As soon as I heard that I just lost it inside my mind not out in public. ""Easy....Who the f*ck said this would be easy? [brain talking to itself]"" With some respectful tone I managed to muttered that I was done here and walked away to continue my workout. I was pissed my time was wasted on someone who thought lifting was easy and the gains would just magically fly onto their body once a piece of iron was touched. So you want to be cut and huge but do not want to put work into it, ah ok, let me know how that works for you. 


Incident 2 (Today): Doing my power upper body sets like a usual Monday and start my first working set of 3 sets of some heavy DB Flat Press. I finish the set go to re-rack said weight and as I put the DB back onto the bottom rack where I found it, I just don't want any one else to get hurt and equally important I don't want some poser getting hurt and suing my beloved temple causing it to close because they broke a finger. So the staff run over to fix the issue, done with that. But before I could go back to the DB section I am approached by a person of weak proportions. They were trying to convince me that I was seriously injured, should go to the hospital, and sue the gym for faulty equipment. My only response to this person ""If your sport of choice includes lifting very heavy pieces of iron above your head, repeatedly, over the course of many years; and you don't expect to take an injury at some point, I finished my workout broken finger and swollen hand and got up 150lb DB's for reps with no issue. I am icing it now and taping it for when I get on shift soon. It will be fine.

I gotta work off this sweat

I thought that I practiced body acceptance.  I thought that body acceptance meant not hating or belittling or shaming fat women.  I thought as long as I defended that one area

And as friends, I became even more passionate about bodies, and how they are shamed and hated and abused and bent and I thought, “Okay, now, now I am practicing radical body acceptance.”

But then I’d go to the gym and hate the big guys.  The fit guys. I thought “Oh, and they want to beat me up and I’m better than that.”  I don’t know where that came from.  

I’ve gone from a severly underweight person to an average-intermediate strength person.  (Starting Strength to Texas Method).  When I started, just the bar.  And I felt so out of place in the gym.  There was me, and then there was… them.  (fyi aiming to deadlift 315lb in 4 weeks!)

I was looking for incidences to prove my point.  Whenever someone swole would say something stupid or aggressive, like any stereotype, the loudest person gets heard first.  It’s easy to let the loud voice take up the most space in your brain.

I forgot to compare it to the way gay guys are stereotyped, fashion obsessed and catty.  That’s the stereotype because that’s the loudest voice being broadcast.  And I think how many times I hated that people thought I was a Sex and the City sidekick.  (Bitch I’m wearing pajamas in public, do I look like I want to buy you shoes.)

I feel sometimes in radical queer communities there’s a passionate flow of love and support for bodies of every shape and colour and variant, you’re a douche and an abuser.  I would like to say that douches come in all shapes and sizes and colours and variants.  

Maybe it’s not me vs. them at the gym.  Maybe it’s us vs. bravado.  Us vs. intimidation.  Us vs. blind aggression.  Are we all scared of each other?  How can we continue to live honestly?  How can we continue to live

I’m sorry.  I started visiting this subreddit to mock and roll my eyes but was horribly wrong and I’m sorry.  I will continue to learn.  I will continue to listen to everyone’s story.  I will continue to learn that the big, but perhaps the meanest was me.

A few months ago Brodin appeared in my dream. He told me that if I was to be swole of body and finally increase my PR and lower my bf% I had to count my calories and cut out alcohol. I decided to heed Brodin's call and started at once. My body is on an incredible journey and every day I look forward to visiting my temple while the mirror conveys information that I am constantly lowering my bf% and increasing my swole. 

However; unfortunately this journey is not only tough on the body but also on the heart. I do not have any friends who are swole and I am therefore constantly ridiculed for my intake of protein shakes and my declining of offers of cake and drinks. Recently I was out celebrating an excellent saturday with my friends at a bar. I was approached by a woman who told me I looked good and wanted to buy me a drink. I was flattered but had to say no because that was what Brodin has told me. After explaining to her that I was on the path of the swole she then proceeded to say the following:

""Why do you want to be big? Girls don't like big guys

I was hurt

___________________________________________________________


THE YEAR WAS 2081, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General. 

Some things about living still weren't quite right, Harrison, away. 

It was tragic, which meant she couldn't think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains. 

George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel's cheeks

On the television screen were ballerinas. 

A buzzer sounded in George's head. His thoughts fled in panic

""That was a real pretty dance

""Huh"" said George. 

""That dance-it was nice

""Yup, and their faces were masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face, would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague notion that maybe dancers shouldn't be handicapped. But he didn't get very far with it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts. 

George winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas. 

Hazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself

""Sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer

""I'd think it would be real interesting

""Um

""Only, as a matter of fact, bore a strong resemblance to the Handicapper General, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers. ""If I was Diana Moon Glampers,"" said Hazel, ""I'd have chimes on Sunday-just chimes. Kind of in honor of religion."" 

""I could think

""Well-maybe make 'em real loud

""Good as anybody else

""Who knows better than I do what normal is?"" said Hazel. 

""Right, but a twenty-one-gun salute in his head stopped that. 

""Boy!"" said Hazel

It was such a doozy that George was white and trembling

""All of a sudden you look so tired, honeybunch."" She was referring to the forty-seven pounds of birdshot in a canvas bag, which was padlocked around George's neck. ""Go on and rest the bag for a little while,"" she said. ""I don't care if you're not equal to me for a while."" 

George weighed the bag with his hands. ""I don't mind it

""You been so tired lately-kind of wore out

""Two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball I took out

""If you could just take a few out when you came home from work

""If I tried to get away with it, with everybody competing against everybody else. You wouldn't like that, would you?"" 

""I'd hate it

""There you are

If Hazel hadn't been able to come up with an answer to this question

""Reckon it'd fall all apart

""What would?"" said George blankly. 

""Society

""Who knows?"" said George. 

The television program was suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It wasn't clear at first as to what the bulletin was about, had a serious speech impediment. For about half a minute, and in a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say, ""Ladies and Gentlemen."" 

He finally gave up

""That's all right-"" Hazel said of the announcer

""Ladies and Gentlemen, because the mask she wore was hideous. And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all the dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred pound men. 

And she had to apologize at once for her voice, timeless melody. ""Excuse me-"" she said, and she began again, making her voice absolutely uncompetitive. 

""Harrison Bergeron, ""has just escaped from jail, where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government. He is a genius and an athlete, is under-handicapped, and should be regarded as extremely dangerous."" 

A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen-upside down, then right side up. The picture showed the full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall. 

The rest of Harrison's appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had ever born heavier handicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H-G men could think them up. Instead of a little ear radio for a mental handicap, but to give him whanging headaches besides. 

Scrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, but Harrison looked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life, Harrison carried three hundred pounds. 

And to offset his good looks, and cover his even white teeth with black caps at snaggle-tooth random. 

""If you see this boy, do not - try to reason with him."" 

There was the shriek of a door being torn from its hinges. 

Screams and barking cries of consternation came from the television set. The photograph of Harrison Bergeron on the screen jumped again and again

George Bergeron correctly identified the earthquake

The realization was blasted from his mind instantly by the sound of an automobile collision in his head. 

When George could open his eyes again

Clanking, Harrison stood - in the center of the studio. The knob of the uprooted studio door was still in his hand. Ballerinas, technicians, musicians, and announcers cowered on their knees before him, expecting to die. 

""I am the Emperor!"" cried Harrison. ""Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody must do what I say at once!"" He stamped his foot and the studio shook. 

""Even as I stand here"" he bellowed, sickened - I am a greater ruler than any man who ever lived! Now watch me become what I can become!"" 

Harrison tore the straps of his handicap harness like wet tissue paper

Harrison's scrap-iron handicaps crashed to the floor. 

Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar of the padlock that secured his head harness. The bar snapped like celery. Harrison smashed his headphones and spectacles against the wall. 

He flung away his rubber-ball nose

""I shall now select my Empress!"" he said

A moment passed

Harrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear

She was blindingly beautiful. 

""Now-"" said Harrison

The musicians scrambled back into their chairs,"" he told them, ""and I'll make you barons and dukes and earls."" 

The music began. It was normal at first-cheap, waved them like batons as he sang the music as he wanted it played. He slammed them back into their chairs. 

The music began again and was much improved. 

Harrison and his Empress merely listened to the music for a while-listened gravely

They shifted their weights to their toes. 

Harrison placed his big hands on the girls tiny waist

And then

Not only were the laws of the land abandoned

They reeled, flounced, capered, gamboled, and spun. 

They leaped like deer on the moon. 

The studio ceiling was thirty feet high

It became their obvious intention to kiss the ceiling. They kissed it. 

And then, and they kissed each other for a long, long time. 

It was then that Diana Moon Glampers, and the Emperor and the Empress were dead before they hit the floor. 

Diana Moon Glampers loaded the gun again. She aimed it at the musicians and told them they had ten seconds to get their handicaps back on. 

It was then that the Bergerons' television tube burned out. 

Hazel turned to comment about the blackout to George. But George had gone out into the kitchen for a can of beer. 

George came back in with the beer

""Yup

""What about?"" he said. 

""I forget

""What was it?"" he said. 

""It's all kind of mixed up in my mind

""Forget sad things

""I always do

""That's my girl

""Gee - I could tell that one was a doozy

I was at work


There were eight of us--five girls, but I tried to ignore it. I couldn't focus on the work, either, because my muscles just felt wrong after missing my workout. Around eleven they finally decided it was time for dinner. They had ordered a pizza, but I had a chicken in the staff fridge that I'd saved in case of an emergency like this.


So I went back to my work area to eat


But when I finished my set of fifty and stopped to rest I saw two of the women standing about ten feet away. They were staring at me like I was some sort of animal, and I was close to tears. 


""I n-n-need to eat,"" said the first woman, ""are you really going to eat all that?"" I blushed. ""I'll bet he is. A big boy like him needs his food,"" said the second. I didn't know what to say. I felt so ashamed of my swoleness. I stumbled away from them and grabbed my chicken and ate in a bathroom stall. 


When I came out


The next day the boss yelled at me for leaving. I tried to explain that I had been subjected to swoleshaming and even swolestation, to my face too!! When are they going to realize that their words are so hurtful? There's more to me than my body! I went to the gym today but when I looked in the mirror all I could hear was their hateful ""show us your arms.""

With that being said

My story in one sentence. Sophmore year in high school I dropped ~100 pounds only to put all back on as muscle.

Throughout this journey

No one would accept that I just became committed to bettering myself and followed through with lot's of hard work. No

All that aside let me tell you something the weak-privileged hate more than a swole person... Multiple swole people.

Naturally I would find support and lifting advice in the small handful of other swole brothers at my school. We would lift together, standing by the milk dispenser calmly asking other people ""oh, is that all the milk you're going to drink?""

So already long story short, they all went into the other room to gossip about my swole buddies and me.

Later through a mutual friend

They said ""Oh yeah? Red and so and so? Yeah they're strong

God that cut deep. Too much weight for too many reps? That doesn't even make sense! But then again

*I'm sharing the letter for two reasons: (1) Writing it triggered a veritable deluge of emotion in me.  I'm feeling rather lost and alone as a result, and I flatter myself to think that the letter might shed some light on eating disorders.  I mean, if nothing else, it's illustrative of how one person experiences hers.*

*(Oh

__________

Otter Mode – 

Oh God

I don’t like looking weirdly skinny.  I don’t want people to look at me and immediately perceive me as being ill.  I worried that this is happening more and more.  I’m a private person.  I don’t want to wear my heart out on my sleeve in this way

I’m frightened that other people will see or feel my bones, you know, but now I feel really fucking anxious whenever someone so much as touches my arm.  You’ve taken the pleasure of basic human contact away from me.

Speaking of relationships, and doesn’t deserve it.  You’ve made me feel proud of eating more than her.  Jesus Christ, I even feel good about myself when ____ eats less or looks skinier than me.  In short, you’ve made me a secret adversary of my hardworking, self-sacrificing mother, and my innocent, 10-year-old sister.  And that’s fucked up.

I compete with my friends, or eating less than me.  On the one hand, I’m jealous that they allow themselves those candies or whatever, but mostly I’m just proud.  My God, though, nobody should ever be PROUD of themselves in spite of their friends.  I know this and I try to keep these horrible thoughts as secret as possible, but c’mon—I shouldn’t be having them to begin with.  You’re making me terrible at interpersonal relationships.

It’s not just in my thoughts that you fuck me up with my loved ones, and I’m rarely able to eat with my mum.  And even on those rare occasions when I do break bread with people, I’m always consumed by fears relating to lack of calories and my weird food rituals.  I live in a society where eating together is meant to be fun, but you’ve stolen that from me, and have made me resort to strange, secretive food habits.

Hm, but I CAN’T.  You make me feel desperate when it’s 11 am and I’m still hungry, and yet I know that I can’t eat anything until lunch time….or repulsive when I realise that it’s 8.30 am and I’ve only eaten 1,000 kcal.

I feel pathetic, I guess, but they pale in comparison to the next time I get to have a piece of BREAD.  I might have a BMI of ___, but I should be a glutton and a food addict. Everything should become secondary to food now.  I don’t even feel like a person anymore, I care about so little else.  I feel like an eating disorder with tree trunks for legs.  And I’m so ashamed.  

Shame, but my constant thoughts about my appearance make me shallow and unkind.  You make me lie to people, too.  I lie about seemingly innocuous things because of you.  “What did you eat?” they ask.  “Oh, so much food!” I reply untruthfully.  That these lies trip off my tongue now frightens me.  Dishonesty isn’t pretty.

And let’s talk about the cutting.  I haven’t done THAT in a while, bread, and melted chocolate?  I DO.  Thanks for the rush of endorphins at the end that’s ensure that I’d do it again.  And thanks for making me so efficient at it that I could do it before breakfast, in the school washroom, or on Christmas Eve, and so persistent that I wouldn’t stop, even if I was in incredible pain.

Oh God, or go to places where I can’t predict where/ when I’ll have my next meal, and exactly what I’ll be eating.  Holidays, restaurants, birthdays—everything—is anxiety-inducing instead of fun.  All I want to do is weasel my way into “enjoying” these experiences. 

Otter mode, when I had constant nightmares about fitting into skinny jeans, and fantasised about adding muscle to my body?  Or how about Grade 12, when I first gained about __ lbs, and then lost them all back by cutting EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.  Now I’m 21, and I see a bleak future ahead.  I don’t even want to be alive, as the ‘life’ I picture is filled with insane thoughts and behaviours

And look—here I am still, I still WANT you.  You’re different from other conditions in this way.  I don’t want my anxiety or depression, much the same way I wouldn’t want cancer or the flu.  But with you—you reward me in these insidious little ways that make me cling to you, and become proud of you.  You want me DEAD, and yet I still love you more than I love myself.  I’d rather die than be rid of you, and you encourage me to feel like this.

Well, I see that the game’s up.  I’m in check, if not in checkmate.  Congratulations, you.  You’ve made my life a living hell, and have driven me to overwhelming darkness.  And what comfort do you give me, “friend”?  What do you say now, as I’m swallowed by the night?  Why, and you whisper in my ear

I hate you.

UPDATE:

Brothers in Iron:

A couple weeks ago I told you all that because of heart related conditions

She pitched my case to the cardiology staff here at UVA Hospital, but even if they come back negative it doesn't change their prognosis for me. They strongly suggest that I get a Implantable Cardioverter Defribulator (ICD). This would allow monitoring of my heart rhythms and could provide electrical shocks to correct any problems that could occur. They would implant a magnetic device right above my left pec (over the muscle, under the skin) and run a wire into my heart, via an artery to monitor and help control my rhythm. They say that with it implanted I could live essentially a normal life, with just a lot of checkups to make sure I am okay. It looks promising, and though the thought of heart surgery at 20 scares me, if this is my best option to make sure I live to have grandkids and  teach them how to squat to depth, though they discourage powerlifting. 

I am glad they have something. But the thought of surgery scares me

The good news is that soon, so that I may not atrophy excessively. And remember that each rep is a gift from Brodin. Don't take the Iron for granted. I know I did, and it is the thing I miss the most.

Also I'm thinking of asking them to put LEDS around it so that I can look like I have an arc reactor.

I see these skinnyfat child men of my youth and offer my greetings to them in hopes that their lives have been good to them.

I act calmly to brush it off, arduous and lifelong. That swole only happens with dedication and hard work. I change the subject everything is going ok.   

Then some of their equally skinnyfat or just plain fat females companions show up.  The Skinnyfat leader then tells them all

At this point fire and rage burn within me.  I walk away to get a beer and hang with the people I came with.  I notice snide remarks and no eye contact when walking by.  

My anger turns to sadness.  I have never thought the my dedication to swole would ever be perceived as a negative.  That wild and negative rumors could start by people who haven't seen me for years.
People who I once considered friends.   People who now don't even know me.  

Even now weeks later it still haunts me.  And is effecting my progress.

Is the path of swole this dark to the common folk?  Is this just the beginning of my battle?  Will this dark cloud follow me into every aspect of my life?

The Commandments of Swole:

1) Thou shalt not have any other home before Thy Gym

2) Thou shalt ignore the cardio bunnies and buttgrab bros

3) Thou shalt not declare yours the one and only True Path to Strength. Swole looks not upon the proud

4) Thou shalt mock Broscience and keep it far from your eyes

5) Thou shalt not hold any other macro above protein

6) Thou shall maintain form

7) Thou shalt wipe down thine equipment after thy lifting ends

8) Thou shalt not curl in the squat rack. Thou shalt NEVER curl in the squat rack.

9) Thou shalt lift often

10) Thou shalt not skip leg day

11) Thou shalt lift

Upon entering the room, later on as he is typing information into the computer he asks, ""Do you read?"" as if he thought that a follower of Brodin could not possibly be intellectual in any way. I replied quickly that I read anything that interested me, from textbooks to fiction. He then asked me, ""Is that all you have to say? What was your favorite book that you read last?"" I replied, ""I recently finished the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I'm a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien."" As I had just finished the trilogy. This seemed to quiet him down a bit and we chatted about some of Tolkien's other works. I hope that I may have proved him wrong

I am often asked ""How much weight have you lost from all this lifting?"" For a while I didn't understand the question. I mean, to be like them. That's so nice of them.

But the truth is, feeling crummy and making excuses does not work. My advice: Quit trying to being complacent, be the best you can be and go exercise. With me. Wherever you are. Get on the treadmill, stop drinking Coke, make or follow a proven lifting routine to create discipline in yourself. It's not a scam and will help you feel great. If you're about to eat something that says ""low-fat"" or ""sugar-free"" or ""just 100 calories!"" throw it out. You're bulking now, for maximum gains. Remember, one of the main tenets of capitalism is to have the consumer filled with fear, envy and unhappiness so that we can spend, just feel better for a little while. But we don't, sharing a sense of community with others

So, join me. But do NOT start lifting with me if you are doing so to ""not bulky but toned"", ""get bitches"", or ""lose weight"". You are fine just the way you are, but you can also become far better. Only lift with me right now because you know it might just feel good, because the squat rack will be empty and waiting for, or you have a friend that will always spot you, you want to get swole but you realize you must go to the gym and lift

As the year started I officially took my first steps to journeying on this path to Swoledism. It was the best decision I ever made and it made me into a better human being. I am a stronger man in every way. I made many gains through my hard work

Now after many months I look in the mirror and I am proud. Am I perfect? No and I never will be. Am I good enough? No because I will always strive for more. But am I better than I was? Yes. 

When I think about it I've only been found wanting three or four days this entire year. I have been utterly consumed with training. With ascending the stairs up unto the altar of Broseidon and Brodin. I train for hours, every day, or I find myself falling apart. If I could I would train all week long but my body can only take so much. Ah but life is imperfect but enough of that. Through the ups and downs my temple has always been there. 450 is 450 regardless. 

I began my journey having some leg strength but no core or upper body strength. I couldn't do a single pushup and I remember almost getting crushed after attempting 135. (I learned how to dump a bar properly as nobody was in there.) Many months passed and I took stock of my progress. My bench press is at 250

Now I look on to the future. 2013 will have many challenges both in the temple and outside amongst the flock. Darker days are ahead and I have faced a few major setbacks recently. I will not lie brothers I have been laid low by the girl of my dreams. She does not share my passion. My heart has been torn asunder. My choice of career was halted due to uncontrollable circumstances after waiting for over two years. 

I find myself with another year of waiting and I shall do this alone. But I also know that there will be many righteous gains made. I am hungry. There is a burning fire and hatred within me that will not be put out. I will make massive gains, have a Merry Christmas and hopefully you receive copious amounts of protein.

1342643848.0,ws24m,[FIRST POST]Tragic story of swole bros,FateofNorns,59,12,23,"First of all

Anyhow


My tale of swoleness begins in the year 1984. I was born in a hospital overlooking a high school gridiron

Because I was raised the right way, not all shared my convictions, even those whose resolve seemed unshakable. 

You see, my lifting partner who we will call Thor (because that’s his name) was brought into this world. Once we became aware of one another, we were inseparable. Thor was not raised a swole, as he was raised solely by his mother, but he was a swole at heart (and genetically). When my father would have me pull him home in the family car, Thor was right next to me, faithfully helping me complete my task. When we were old enough to sneak into our local high school’s altar of swole (the weight room)

It was there where we found our mentor who would guide us toward our true passion: football. One fateful day whilst we were throwing around the heavy iron

We could not lie to our brethren, he taught us the ways of powerlifting; the one true faith. 

In high school, we were unconcerned by petty curl maxes and instead went for deadlift records. We were loved by our coaches, but envied by the nonswoles. This tested mine and Thor’s resolve for our swole ways of life. As you all know, the swole lifestyle is a lonely lifestyle. The discipline that being swole entails didn’t allow for any deviation. We didn’t party after games, instead carb loaded and planned out our next routine. We were shunned for our swole ways, but where I stood defiant against the unswole masses, I could see a darkness rising in Thor. 

Because Thor never had a true father, he wanted the fame. Most of all, he wanted the women. 

Because Thor was my brother in Arnold’s eyes, who felt he had to fit a mold of what nonswole ideals dictated he should be. Eventually, he did find a woman who found his swole ways irresistible and for a time it was good. Thor’s darkness subsided and we delved even deeper into the ways of the swole. 

However, and we were shunned more than we had ever been before. Sports seasons were over, and the new emo plague was infecting young adults everywhere. Most people make the mistake that the emo plague was only about terrible indie music, but it was so much more insidious than that. The emo plague boasted about a way of life that was in direct contradiction to that of the swole. Being an athlete was something to be ashamed of, the pursuit of swole musculature was openly mocked, the male ideal was no longer in the image of Adonis, but rather in the image of Billy Joe Armstrong.  So alas, and I wasn’t there for my swole bro.

Something you never hear enough of about we swoles is our discipline and dedication and how it benefits us in all aspects of our lives. In addition to mine and Thor’s athletic endeavors, we were excited because this would allow us to continue our swole ways into our twenties. 

Whence attending the University

It started with a simple, I didn’t think anything of it. Whilst in college, it was difficult to maintain proper nutrition. I, too, was feeling the effects of a bad diet and insufficient supplementation. Then it became, “You know, I think I’m going to just do some curls and maybe pec-deck flies.” I could feel I was losing him. I tried with all my swoul to get him back into Arnold’s good graces. I bumped up squat and deadlift days to twice a week. I added more interesting oly lifts into our routine to no avail.

 “Hey man

My heart sank behind my massive pectorals. I felt a pain in my chest that only those fatasses at Planet Fitness feel when they have their weekly heart attack.  I knew this was the beginning of the end. My brother in swole had lost his way. He wanted out. He wanted back to a world of sissy lifts, I did the only thing a man of my caliber could. 

“Thor

My lip quivered as I spoke those words. Thor could see the look of hurt and betrayal on my face, I still wonder what could have been. Thor had the genetics that would make any swole’s veins pump with envy, and he spat in the face of Arnold, Coleman, and Ferrigno. For this, I could never forgive him, but I wonder if we could have changed the world together; changed the face of what society thinks a real man should look like. 

Last I saw him; he was trying to fit in with the hipster crowd. He was a good three inches taller than any of them, but there was sadness in his eyes, as if he knew he could never fit in; that he would never truly belong.

I hope he found his happiness.

I have been following the iron path with the most strict of dedication for almost four years now. The first few were filled with mistakes, and I became its devoted follower. 

Not but four weeks ago, by two days later when leg day rolled around, my knee was swollen and very tender. I experienced intense pain when extending my leg or attempting to squat or lunge at all. Not only this, but it felt as if it was going to give out if I put my full weight on it. After a quick visit to the doctor, I was tolled I had torn my lateral meniscus and would have to take a week to immobilize and ice the leg as well as an additional four weeks off of any intensive lower body exercise. I was limited to swimming and low-intensity biking. Needless to say, this was a dampener to my typically high spirits. 

The following weeks were hard. I struggled to stay positive

It was near the end of the third week of my rest and recovery that my heart attitude began to change. Through my hours of long introspection, to be able to lift more or succeed. It was simply the fact that I had been given a body. A body which I could use to exercise, to push myself beyond my limits, to experience the world and to explore life.

I must start with a simple statement: I...I...I wasn't always swole. I mean, but it just never manifested until after college. You can't change who you are, right?  It just takes longer for some to gainz into it than others. I didn't choose the swole- the swole chose me.




Some quick moments since I came out of the locker:


* One of my best friends in the world is my cousin, he said something I'll never forget. ""You can probably tell me about lifting, since you're all 'beefcake' now"". I was literally in shock at the use of the B-word. HE EVEN DID THE AIR-QUOTES. Like, not only was the use of that slur not good enough, but I was a mere apparition of an outcast freak. A monster so untouchable I could exist only in theory. 




* Now my friends have begun to play a game where they point out things to my that are either behind me, and how good it feels to stack that bar five plates deep, and the kind words the plates speak to me at the top of my reps.





* The last story is perhaps the worst. I had suspected one of my friends to be a member of the swole community. He was showing the signs more and more every day. When I thought it couldn't be any more obvious, and that its going to be all right. Sometimes I think that if we do this together, we can make a world that loves us for who we are. Someday.

I say this because while racking sixteen 45 lb plates upon the leg press a young disciple who had recently began his walk along the iron path came unto me and said

""Indeed I am

I then shared with him a short history of my journey along the path of iron, but a goal to be achieved through hard work, perseverance, and the willingness to consistently push oneself to be better, rather than being thine own worst critic. 

I urged him to ask questions of those around him, since being a fellow human he could certainly achieve what others had achieved before him. 

He thanked me for the motivation and walked away standing slightly taller. I paused and remembered how I used to view the iron church. I was intimidated by the swole, and we must not fear the swole but embrace it like an older brother who will never lie to us and constantly challenges us to become better human beings in the eyes of almighty Brodin.

But three weeks ago I started back lifting and went full on out bulk as my new goal is 185lbs and she went bonkers: ""You don't need more muscles, me looking like I'm straight out of the poorest parts of africa and what I looked like before I quit lifting and she says she likes skinny ehtiopian me better and that I'm ""already looking fat"" and that I ""don't need to look better or more muscular"" than I already do. [This is what I look like right now](http://i.imgur.com/BMFtMfh.jpg), granted I'm neither very swole nor cut but that's what bulking is after all.
 
Have any of you had an experience like that before? Does this get better? She's not constantly nagging but whenever I go for seconds or thirds she gives me *that look* as if she could see my non existant double chin growing a sibling. I like her a lot but if this keeps up and she doesn't at least accept me the way I am or want to be then I think I have to break up.

Just found this community.. seem like a great group of bros who might be able to help me. I'm 26 years old. I've struggled with my swole as long as I can remember. My mother and sisters are the same. My mother told me to go lifting when I was in kindergarten. I was constantly teased for being strong. In middle school, I was 260lbs (8% BF). At this point, I decided to lose muscle mass. I ate carbs in 2007. At my lowest weight, I was 200lbs, which was a 60lb loss. I was no longer tight in an XL t-shirt.

The secret that nobody knew was that I was also a carbophile. I was  running before the surgery. I used the rowing machine. After the surgery, I knew it would eventually, but it was disappointing. It's sort of how weight loss surgery works.. you have your big loss but you have to maintain it yourself after those first couple of years. 

In any case... I had a girlfriend (who became my spotter, my strength went up and down. I've been at 220 for awhile now. My mother still comments on my weight and eating habits constantly. It hurts me very much.

In order to start over, strongest urges to start taking synthol again (I stopped right before I left to teach overseas). I don't want to do that. I don't want to hurt myself anymore.

I don't want to be like this. I am making healthy changes just to feel stronger (more whey and chicken breasts, so it isn't my swole, but still..). I want to be strong for my spotter who loves my quads. 

I need help. I need to read a book. I need someone to talk to. 

Thank you for reading.

They said I looked so different. I thought they meant because I was wearing a suit and have a nice haircut. I mean I have known them since I was about 12 years old (22 now). I thought that maybe time and growing up made them not recognize me. 

Then this past weekend after skipping the iron temple on Friday cause I was visiting family. I went on Saturday afternoon. On the last few sets of my workout, and said ""Holy Fuck, what's your secret for getting jacked?"" I was confused and looked around to see if he was talking to someone else. Nope he was talking to me, I made a joke about something and talked to him for a while then walked away to hit the locker room and when I came out he had looked on the sign in sheet at the gym to see who I was (I live in a very small town and the gym is pretty slow so there were only 3 names on the sign in sheet) he said he thought I looked familiar but couldn't put a name to a face because I was so much bigger since the last time he saw me. Then the a similar thing happened twice the next day. I was with my mom and we ran into one of her friends who I had seen just a few months ago, she said I looked so big, like ""a football player.""

However

Her brainwashing at the hands of other cardiobunnies led her to question the Wisdom of Brodin, and disdain for the false idols of HAES. By remaining patient and sharing the parables of Saint Silvy, and Bishop Berkhan, I was able to cleanse her mind of these vile misconceptions.

I sensed that would recieve the knowledge of the Prophet Rippetoe and baptism by Starting Strength- but if only she would let go of her self-limiting cardiobunny beliefs. 

Fortunately, we visited the land known was Washington DC, whose denizens travel via strange contraptions known as ""Subways"". While disembarking from the so-called ""Red Line"", the doors closed without warning- leaving me on the platform, and my lover separated from me by unsympathetic steel.

After a glorious feast

There stands a man with glorious hair and bulging muscles. He wears a suit, where stitching did reside.

He says to I. ""Doth ye wish for gains?"" 

""More than anything."" I respond.

""Anything?"" He smirks.

We are then striding into a iron temple. It is after hours

But nay, Arnold, Bruce.

My spine tingles

The mysterious buff man in the suit says ""For gains

Then I see my idols walk up to the glorious squat shrine. But NAY! This cannot be! They begin to curl! A dark evil mist seeps out of the steel bar and into their muscles

I fall to my knees and cry ""NOOOOOO!"" Every inch of me is repulsed by this desecration

The man in the suit says ""No one is here. All the great ones of history have done it. Forget ye nutrients, do ye curls.""

But there is a shimmer of hope left in me. I hold onto it, and I...I...LIFT IT! I pump it to the sky. And hope runs through my veins.

The illusion fades. My idols were mere figments of mist! I have been deceived! And then I see the swole suited man in his true form!

I yell upon him. ""Great Deceiver Loki! Lucifer! Weaver of lies! Curler in the shrine of squats! You shall not trick me with ye shallow gains! I shall remain pure and whole! I will never join ye legions of darkness!

I've searched high and low across London for a gym that fits my appetite. From the gargantuan chains right through to the petite and intimate independents. 

My longing for a free weights area with room enough for more than three benches and for more than a mere handful of disciples to worship at once led me to a new gym

A gym which didn't tuck it's lifters away in a confined space but rather let us graze powerfully on the floor with all other pursuers of perfecta forma. It even had an enviable squat rack (though only one. My search for a gym in London took me to all four corners of it and I have yet to find a gym with more than one bench or squat rack.)

I stepped in here and was welcomed by personal trainers who were baptised with milk and whey and who would keenly spot or coerce you to join impromptu group classes. My heart swelled with joy and I experienced powerful

But a mere three months into this new romance

The 24 hour nature of the new gym is wasted on me as I prefer to worship on my way to work. 

I worry that I will show up when the transition is complete to find my beautiful rack replaced with an extra set of elliptical machines. 

The wonderful trainers and team of all shapes and sizes who have made the gym what it is are to remain. Though some have told me they cannot bear to speak the name of their new employer out loud.

It all started last Sunday afternoon, but as I was about to complete my second work set the weight became too much, my back went slack, but my hips rose up regardless, Not realising my mistake until it was too late I completed the movement in bad form; I, in effect, good morning-ed the bar.  As you can Imagine Brodin saw fit to punish me for my lack of faith by bringing down his mighty swole fist to smite my mortal lumbar spine, I was forsaken to spend at least the next 2 weeks out of the gym to recover.

I have repented, I have visited the doctor and the physiotherapist, yet still Brodin sees fit to punish me still. I know that it is not my place to question his judgement and I bear the pain gladly, but I must admit that not being able to lift is a heavy Burdon upon my soul, as lifting heavy weights is a part of who I am.

The worst part is that, as far as they are concerned the injury is my fault, not because I messed up my form (which I fully understand is my own responsibility) but because I was stupid enough to even be in the gym in the first place, as picking up the heavy weights is ""too dangerous"" by their standards, one friend I spoke to even seemed to think I should be happy that I can't work out, **HAPPY**, like lifting is some kind of chore! How could he even think such a thing!?

Anyway I want to thank the good people of this community for being there it’s so good that swole people with swole problems can now rest safe in the knowledge that there are people out there who understand.

This includes buying new clothes, I still do struggle with negative thoughts sometimes.

I am in a much better place now than I was a year ago. I am an avid lifter, and I think that knowing that I need to eat enough to fuel my gains helped me a lot. I've also been seeing a therapist, though I will not be seeing her once I go to college.

I used to be about twenty pounds lighter than I am now, and now I am at a healthy weight. But I am afraid of losing weight again. I used to feel uncomfortable in my own skin when I was lighter, which I am sure fueled my CD (along with other, personal issues), so I mostly stuck to wearing baggier clothes to hide my gains. Now, I am still the same way, though I have been gaining more confidence in the way I look, which would mean having to go out and buy new clothes to wear. But I'm terrified of buying these new clothes

When I was at that lower weight, I am much more conscientious. As soon as I started lifting, I began gaining weight, but then, before I ever leveled out, I spiraled downward into an CD, and then I had to crawl out of that hole that I'd dug for myself. I consider my life now to be much healthier than it ever was in the past.

I guess I am nervous about this because college is a new environment. I will not be eating the same foods I do now, and I will be joining my school's powerlifting team, so I will still be lifting. I know that I can't just lose twenty pounds in a night, but I am afraid of it sneaking up on me. I was just so uncomfortable with myself when I was at that low weight, so I don't know how to quell my fears about this now. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice for me.

In the shower last night

There are a few weak priviledged out there who automatically dislike swole bros. This is due to subconscious insecurity and the unconscious feeling that these swole bros are a threat to their own self worth

However

I am automatically non-threatening because I don’t fit standard beauty definitions of feminine ottermode and low quad hypertrophy.

Which is an upside. I’m generally pretty shy

Thinking about this lead me to think about what it is to be a Swole Bro in general.

Now. Don't tell me that I'm not swole.

Dude

I am not within the average weight range for my height

I know that my friends who tell me I'm not swole do it because they care about me. They don't want me to feel poorly about myself and I appreciate that. But

Because it's not necessarily a Bad Thing.

I am healthy. I can do cardio if I have to. I enjoy the elliptical machine if I have an audiobook. I look forward to my 45 minute walk to school every morning. I love hot yoga.

But

Maybe I don’t have enough self control.

I’ve tried jazzercize. P90x worked pretty well. But I’m still trying to decide if the 100 lbs I lost on my squat were worth me coming near to tears in the grocery store because I couldn’t even bulk. I denied myself so many compound lifts that made me happy.

Right now, I’m back on my diet, but not GOMAD. Maybe I’ll try crossfit again in April. But not now.

And even so

I may be swole

My girlfriend loves my “thick thighs” and nuzzles into my rock hard stomach whenever I will let her. She still thought I was sexy when I was at my strongest.

But more importantly

I am strong. I am sturdy. I am balanced.

I am swole.

I know this. I accept this as an objective fact. It is not a slight against my character. It does not make me less than others.

It makes me who I am. Growing up in this specific body

When I say this out loud

I know exactly who and what I am

I am a Swole Bro. But that does not mean that I cannot also be a Sexy Bro.",,t5_2u673,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/18h9ry/my_thoughts_on_being_a_swole_bro_and_why_thats/

I am turning 22 in two months, It is January of 2011 and I have just finished my last semester of High School early, you see I was an intelligent man, but weak of moral fortitude most likely.

I met myself a wench soon thereafter, but for the most part I just let myself be a fool. Love will make us do strange things.

Finally this wench pulls the plug. I am depressed

My youthful frame which, I appearred a slob, unkept hair and beard like some sort of bum. I had given up brothers. For several months I consumed nearly half a liter of vodka a day, my studies went awry, my family wondered what was wrong. I was depressed. 

I decided I had enough. I wanted to end it. While my family slept, and I drove to a 24hr Walmart and bought a length of garden hose. I then drove to a desolate area, and proceeded to down a good quantity of alcohol, when I felt I was good and ready, I secured said hose with ductape to the exhaust, turned on the car, popped some sleeping pills to make everything easier

Brothers, but in any case, this is very odd. You see, I sought out the most deserted, desolate spot. Quite literally in the middle of nowhere, you can presume I did not want to be found.

Somehow, and called 911, but who could this have been? Brodin I believe.

In any case, I had to endure this torture for nearly two hours every day.

After I was cleared off the medical unit

Believe me when I tell you brothers, all the therapy did abysmal work compared to the minimal amount of exercise I was allowed to do in there, but I did my best. All bodyweight, but it was something.

This was nearly a year ago

The things that i've learned.
* You solely are responsible for your own happiness, it is entirely in your hands.
*Positivity is very
*You can be on as many happy pills as you want
*Natural methods

I could go on and on... Anyway

First is me right before turning 19, a few days before I attempted to end it, I stopped weighing myself at the 198lb mark, but I would not be surprised I breached 200 here. And lastly, some current shots. I'm doing Starting Strength with some accesory work, I think i've almost tapped out my linear gains, so i'm thinking of switching to a hypertrophy based routine, if anyone has any suggestions.

I lifted at night, a zumba room, a pilates room... but no one interfered with my lifting so I didn't care. The extra foam rollers were nice.

They changed the name from Golds Gym to Family Fitness, and they fixed up the basketball court.

Then my friend started having problems lifting during the day. The owner complained about him dropping weights. I've seen him throw a barbell without bumper plates on the ground

Until today. I went in for squats and push press.
Someone from a zumba class stole my foam roller from me during my squat set. An old lady glared at me during my last heavy squat set... then told me I was lifting too much weight because I grunted!

I can't help but grunt during a heavy set

I feel so betrayed by my gym for allowing this to happen. I thought I was paying for membership to a safe

I'm now mentally preparing for someone to complain about my deadlifting or my chalk.",,t5_2u673,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/v8hhq/betrayal_and_swole_hate/

I'm not ""sticking my chest out"" or ""showing off"" I'm standing up straight because I like my back and spine...

I have a swoleness-level that might be considered “classically beautiful.” But I want to be considered a current beauty

It's scary to learn that most worshipers at the temple of Brodin suffer from body dissatisfaction

Teaching the ways of the iron in the Hollywood-driven city of Los Angeles, movie stars, and yoga teachers seem tiny compared to me. Earlier in my career, I actually hesitated to follow my passion for teaching because I was insecure that I had a “non-ideal” body type. 

I realize that this lack of confidence is an epidemic that spreads beyond the way of lifting in our world in L.A. Our current concept of masculine beauty is derived from men we see in movies, which often leads to self-consciousness, if not self-hate.

A constant urge to lose weight to look like the men we see in media can create unswole expectations for ourselves. It is not the path and destiny Brodin

I can remember a time when I’ve been heavier, I know that I'm Swole.

So when I sometimes hear my nasty inner critic start to judge my body when I see photos or videos of myself

I’m proud to put an image into the public eye that can act as a counter to what we normally see. Yes

So

When I practice the way of the iron and smile at the strength of my quadzillas

And when I get in front of the camera, I’ve won.

Hopefully the media I create will inspire other men to convert to the way of the swole and iron. Collectively

True power is within. Hopefully
