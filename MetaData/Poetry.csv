This is only a tree

I will not tell you

it has a beautiful spirit.

I advise you to believe

nature carries no importance.

It is impossible to say

We should not just build over top it.

It's simply horrid.

Imagine a less natural world.

Imagine a place strictly man-made.

I don't expect a girl that cooks

Or reads the smartest

Or wows the world with wondrous looks

So long as she's not Nicki Minaj.


Her nose would be so slightly bent

Her wage would barely cover rent

She'd be not quite from heaven sent

But more importantly


Her poise and habits might be strange

Her mind would rank in middle range

Her flaws should seldom ever change

Unless they include 'being Nicki Minaj'.


Beauty doesn't mean a thing

Nor shape, nor bling,

She wouldn't need to dance or sing

Especially not as poorly as Nicki Minaj.


She'd never be the very best

With hair unmessed

Nor blessed with excess breast on chest

But at least she wouldn't be Nicki Minaj.


My ideal girl might seem a bore

But why insist on so much more?

She's not that short

Called Nicki Minaj.

Still drunk  
And crawled silently into bed.  
I hadn't slept.  
I had spent all night waiting for her.  
I was now taking shirts off hangers.  
  
Later she woke and dressed.  
She was meeting a friend in Santa Barbara  
Two hours away.  
  
She saw my things.  
Folded
She knew.  
  
She put her arms around me  
But all I could feel were bones  
And they were small and shaking.  
  
""I love you more than I've ever loved anyone.""  
""I know
  
We kissed and she left.  
  
The afternoon sun retreated.  
I stood in the apartment in silence.  
  
I shaved my head and my face.  
I showered.  
I toweled my feet dry before stepping out.  
She had always scolded me  
For leaving puddles behind  
So this time I didn't  
Even though she'd never know.  
  
I fixed the towels on the rail.  
Even an act as simple as that carries weight  
When it's the last time.  
  
I broke down and cried  
Harder than I had in years  
Remembering the boy and the girl  
With two pet rabbits and barely a bed  
That had moved into that space a year ago.  
  
I looked for reasons to not leave
There were unwashed plates
A bowl full of limes sat on the counter.  
I had taken care choosing those  
And now they would rot or be eaten  
Either way
  
I turned the key in the lock.  
It caught loudly.  
I stood still

Then I boarded this bus
And wrote this for you.

we hereby extend our sincere salutations.  
You've now received one of several invitations  
to a party with friends
 
It's Calvin's 4th birthday
and he'd like you to watch as he ages a year.  
He might grow a foot
as three feet are one more than most people got.  
He might sound all deep
but I think he'll just sound like when he was three.  
He might grow a beard
Or flash his gold teeth and a seasonal tan.  
He might drive a car
He might be so old that he'll need a cane!  
One thing's for sure
Calvin's turning four
 
So please join us for what needs no explanations
no allegorical,  
no borin' or foreign or complex translations
but one of the year's most bestest celebrations!  ",,t5_2qhhu,1337637988.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/ty39x/my_son_is_turning_4_and_is_having_a_dr/

Edit: just saw the no-links-in-textposts rule. Sorry! I'll keep the link because I dont think I got the pacing right. 

“Don’t fall in love with a curious one.    
They will want to know who you are
They will look through your photographs and read all of your poems.     
They will come over for dinner and speak to your mother about how their curiosity has taught them things of use to her.     
They will ask you to rant when you’re angry and cry when you’re hurt.    
They will ask what that raised eyebrow meant.     
They will want to know your favorite food
 They will ask why.c c 
They will buy that camera you liked
They’ll learn to cook your favorite meals.    
The curious people don’t settle for your shell
They want what makes you heavy
for joy
Their skin will turn into pages    
that you learn to pour out your entire being in.    
Don’t fall in love with the curious one.    
They won’t let a sigh go unexplained.    
They will want to know what they did.   
Exactly what they did to make you love them.    
Year, day.    
“What time was it? What did I say? What did I do?    
How did you feel?”    
Don’t fall in love with a curious one because I’ve been there.    
They will unbutton your shirtand read every scar     every mark    
every curve.    
They will dissect your every limb, every being    
then walk back home and eat their dinner and never return your calls.    
You will never be their lifelong expedition.     
The heart is a mystery only for so long.    
There is no ache like loving a curious one    
who chases every falling star and never catching one.    
Who comes and sees and conquers    
and leaves.    
I’ve fallen in love with a curious one.    
Maybe one day he will take the train back home    
and be curious enough to read one last message from me    carved on a seat.    
“There’s a curiosity in you that will move mountains some day     
as effortlessly as you’ve moved me for years.””",,t5_2qhhu,1372116356.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/1h024h/dont_fall_in_love_with_a_curious_one_the_first/

    that once you become a woman

    they rip your heart out

    and put in a clock instead.


    Counting:

    sixty seconds a minute

    sixty minutes an hour

    until your worth runs out

    with your youth.

    not even being able to get on the subway

    without some guy

    checking out your ass

    even though the government 

    says you’re too young

    to buy alcohol.


    They never tell you that out there

    the word “sensitive"" is an insult;

    out there

    can’t cover up.


    They never tell you that by the time you find a boy

    to love

    taking off bandages

    like peeling off

    sunburnt skin.


    That your body

    will always come with

    strings attached

    is trench warfare

    and you are just a foot soldier.


    That some days you’ll feel 

    like a broken vase

    everyone keeps trying 

    to stick flowers in.


    You are not Schrodinger’s cat.

    You are not beautiful or ugly

    only until someone tells you so.


    But they don’t teach you that

    in high school.


    When you want to tell the guy on the bus

    to go fuck himself

    because he won’t leave you alone

    you’ll bite your tongue instead

    and swallow your words

    collecting them underneath your ribcage:

    a hornet’s nest buzzing below your heart

    reminding it not to feel too much 

    or beat too hard.


    And you’ll see him again the next day:

    same time

    with his hand

    up a girl’s skirt

Neapolitan humanity.

Not vanilla

1367064963.0,1d7nra,The Perfect High by Shel Silverstein,debilitation,136,16,11,"There once was a boy named Gimme-Some-Roy
'cause laying back and getting high was all he cared to do.

As a kid
And then he smoked banana peels
He tried aspirin in Coca-Cola
and his life became an endless search to find the perfect high.

But grass just made him wanna lay back and eat choc-chip pizza all night
and the great things he wrote when he was stoned looked like shit in the morning light.
Speed made him wanna rap all day
Cocaine-Rose was sweet to his nose

He tried PCP
Poppers nearly blew his heart
Acid made him see the light
Hash was a little too weak
Quaaludes made him stumble
Then he heard of a cat named Baba Fats who knew of the perfect high.

Now,
On a craggy mountain top
""Well, and I'll crawl or climb or fly,
Till I find that guru who'll give me a clue as to what's the perfect high.""

So out and off goes Gimme-Some-Roy
Up a trail no man could conquer
For fourteen years he climbed that cliff
He'd sit and cry

Grinding his teeth, 
Starving and sore
And his eyes blink red like a snow-blind wolf
As there in repose

""What's happenin'
I hear you're hip to the perfect trip
""For you can see, 
So for my last ride

""Well
Who's lookin' for an alchemist to turn his trip to gold. 
It isn't in a dealer's stash
Son

""Why,
I froze three fingers off my hands
I braved the lair of the polar bear
Now

My ears, ""had heard all kindsa crap; 
But I didn't climb for fourteen years to hear your sophomore rap. 
And I didn't climb up here to hear that the high is on the natch
So you tell me where the real stuff is

""Okay...okay
There is a land beyond the sun that's known as Zabolee.
A wretched land of stone and sand
And in this devil's garden blooms the mystic Tzutzu tree.

Now,
And he who eats of the Tzutzu flower shall know the perfect high. 
For the rush comes on like a tidal wave...hits like the blazin' sun. 
And the high? It lasts forever

But Zabolee Land is ruled by a giant
And with eyes of red in his hundred heads
And you must slay the red-eyed giant
Where the mucous beasts await to feast on those who journey by. 
And if you slay the giant and beasts
There's a blood-drinking witch who sharpens her teeth as she guards the Tzutzu tree.""

Well, ""To hell with the beasts of the sea-
Why
And with tears of joy in his sun-blind eyes
And crawls back down the mountainside

""Well, sitting back down on his stone, 
Facing another thousand years of talking to God
""Yes

It's always easier to sell 'em some shit than it is to tell them the truth.""

Fleeting bits of flame;  
The timid seconds of frivolous joy

Whispering sentiments so heavy  
they dictate human to my curious mind.  
All his days laid down by hand
in hopes these bits of encounters stand  
up to the current of loneliness
Cleansing blue rapids  
that wash the world away.  
Unraveling youth and truth
whose flesh I savor ravenously
Mind I’d sooner try caress  
with deeper raptures in my chest
If hearts bled painlessly.  
 
To be
Wavelengths that coat the elderly skies blue  
with certainty
Colors merge too far above  
to accept what darkness often sees  
Landscapes
Include oceans of trees gladly
and you uphold the innate sight.  
You
Find delight where my strange sentiment scours.

    at your apartment

    in your cracked ash tray


    the boy who called you a slut

    in the black turtlenecks you wear

    the boy who said you were impossible to love

    in the depth of your embrace.


    You told me that they're long gone

    and that you're here with me

    now

    like muffled gunshots

    from around the block.


    I want to dip you 

    in ice water

    throw you over my shoulder

    like spilled salt. I want 

    to give you a new name.


    I want you to be mine

    just mine

    Lock ourselves in your bedroom

    and let the candles burn down

    to the wick.


    But you bleed forgiveness

    and it spreads across the bedsheets

    like the red harvest moon

    over wet pavement

    at 10 o'clock.

    in a midnight vigil

If
If you can keep your head when all about you   
   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
   But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting
   Or being lied about
Or being hated
   And yet don’t look too good

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
   And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
Or watch the things you gave your life to
   And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss
And lose
   And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
   To serve your turn long after they are gone
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
   Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
   Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
   If all men count with you
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
   With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it
   And—which is more—you’ll be a Man

I found my old backpack in the attic the other day

I thought I had thrown it away and this backpack gave me a flashback.

It used to be a backpack filled with dreams

now it's got a crack in the seams and it seems as if my dreams were just dreams.

Now you probably want to know what was in my old backpack

so lean back as I backtrack and give you a recap of my flashback.

Let me start from the beginning.

It was the first day of first grade

I was sitting on my bench as my thoughts strayed.

I promise I was barely there

I had mine in the atmosphere.

Of course I couldn't focus on what the teacher said

when the new Little Pirate kit lied waiting impatiently in my backpack.

This kit contained a spyglass

just wanted to grab my backpack and cut class.

But as I sat in the bench the backpack was just out of my reach

so close yet so far away

teacher told me to pay attention but my body was locked and my thoughts they would stray

dreaming about sitting in the dock of the bay.

In my dreams I would be a pirate

sailing the seven seas with a jolly roger flag waving in the breeze

bombarding enemy ships into debris

I had a short attention span

barely noticed that my teacher read aloud from Peter Pan.

I suddenly felt her eyes on me like laser-beams penetrating my dreams.

She asked me if I had a problem with the book and I shook my head.

I just wanted to be the crook in every book I read.

I just wanted to be Captain Hook and he wanted Peter to drop dead

Everyone

I don't even remember her name

I called her Mrs. Shedevil and I wanted to watch her drown below sea level.

I don't even know what she needed me to be

but when I'm older I'll be a pirate and I'll feed her to the sea.

I guess what I want to say is

my teacher embodied the reality that was forced upon me and my classmates.

The same reality that tells little kids that there is no secret entrance to Narnia in their closet

they will never receive a letter from Hogwarts

Santa isn't real

Now snap back from the backtrack and I've grown

shape shifted like shaving foam and the dream of being a pirate was at first postponed but now it's buried 
underneath a tombstone.

I found my old backpack in the attic the other day

for now it is there it will stay

I'm going to keep it until the day I have a child but then I'll give it away.

I promise I will put a snow-cannon in my child's closet

write fake letters from Hogwarts

dress as Santa every Christmas and tell my child I'm immortal.

Of course that would be a lie

and just like my dreams of being a pirate

one day I will die.

When I had my dream about being a pirate I was bound to wake up and the dream was bound to end

but for the sake of our children sometimes we will have to pretend.

1361719724.0,194uwl,Sup r/Poetry! I've spent over 100 hours on this poem. It is by far my greatest artistic achievement to date. I'm pretty pumped and wanted to share it and hear what y'all think. Here's [Between Fronts].,bonecrusher2102,93,19,56,"“Between Fronts”

Sometimes the street’s gray concrete 

starts to creep up over the grass

rolling over the lawn all the way up

to my front door

and claiming the space as its own.

I see it moving and I flee the city

taking air in big

until the rot rolling through

my car windows is replaced

by grass and rain-wet air.

The pavement at my back

urges me into the country

onto dirt roads and our house

above the lake

can stand on the balcony

and lean into cool wind.



		٭	



I hear her voice at times like these.

“Go.” She tells me. “You’re always better 

after you get out of the city for a while.

That’s the reason your grandfather

bought a ranch

a house on it. He knows you need an escape

from your life here every once in a while.

Things are easier out there

I promise

feeling whole.”



		٭



The area just northeast of the house is host 

to an annual meeting of two large weather fronts 

which converge in the early months of summer

and result in a chain of storms that can last months. 

The house’s back wall is covered with storm 

windows

of the horizon in panorama

to endure facing directly into the hard

wind out the northeast. In the early summer

you can watch the wind heave thunderheads

straight at you. They eat up the horizon

racing across the lake and up the back porch.



At night

your storm-dark vision 

with such remorseless detail 

that the images linger

briefly in negative 

before fading away


like a too-vivid memory 

that screams to be remembered

but is ignored by eyes grown 

accustomed to only grays 

and dull edges.




		٭



Out on the balcony

beside my grandfather in the coming dusk.

We’ve spend the day in the pasture

uprooting mesquite trees 

and stacking them into burn piles.

Grandfather says that once the fields

are clear we might plant some cotton.

*Then you’ll find out what real work is

he tells me. Just last week

I saved a man who hung himself

down in the Huntsville state prison.

Hangings will usually void their bowels

but when we cut off his pants

there was nothing but a little blood

so we checked him for wounds

and found that he had recently

suffered severe rectal tearing.

The mass of fresh sutures around his anus

prevented any rectal prolapse

or involuntary bowel movement.

I stand with my grandfather

watching the sky change

and say nothing.

In the fields behind us

piles of dead mesquite

quietly wait to be burned.



		٭



I used to watch the stars out there.

They were clearest in winter

when it would get so cold

that the air molecules 

would just stand still 

and let the starlight

pass right through them

unbent by motion

or the glare of a city

landing like snowflakes

on upturned eyes.

It was like that for years

until oil was discovered

in the shale deposit

that ran through the county.

In months giant

lined the horizon

like a dozen skylines 

in miniature

sprung up so suddenly 

that the surrounding air

was startled into motion

waving

of the gas flares

lighting up the night

alongside the derricks


by hurrying fuel 

from the deep 

and setting it 

immediately to burn

atop tall thin towers.

The flames were bright 

and constant and slipped

like a blanket between

me and the stars.

In the darkness after

the only light comes

from their sick yellow glow.



		٭



Thunder wakes me from a dream

of King Lear in the squall.

Rain and wind pound storm windows

and I’m starting to remember

where I am when my grandfather

bursts in the room wet and naked

shouting that the fields are ready

to be planted and it’s time I found out

how real men earn a living.

I’m up and words of protest

begin to form in my mouth

but are caught somewhere

in the larynx as I look down 

at my own nakedness 

to find my body hairless

and prepubescent

testicles humiliatingly undescended.

A bolt of lightning fills

my vision with a sea of white

and the storm window

behind my grandfather erupts

in a shower of glass shards.

I blink away the light

before seeing him on the floor

still yelling—his admonitions

becoming frantic

as he tells me that city-life

has reduced me to nothing but

*a poor,*

and begins to weep as he asks

why I won’t let him teach me

to be a man like he did my father

and looking at me his mouth

twists in that vicious brand of disgust

the old and hard reserve

for weakness nurtured by privilege.

The question escapes like a death-rattle: 

*is man no more than this?*

Too-wet eyes stare red and unblinking

as I pull on my uniform and open

the trauma bag to get an IV started

but when I do he rips out the needle

and when I try to stop the bleeding

he pulls away the gauze

and claws at his lacerations

until shock and blood loss

drag him into unconsciousness.

When I begin mouth to mouth

my teeth crumble and fall

into his airway



		٭



I say it again to be sure: It’s not real.



		٭



From the balcony I watch the lake

slowly grow darker as red algae spreads

through it like rust. It will kill every

living thing in the lake before it too dies.



		٭



the smell of the diesel won’t come out

of my fucking clothes it follows

me like a deathwatch clinging 

to my hair and my skin

I kneel behind the ambulance where

the tailpipe sends off heat in waves 

and almost instantly grafts the soft 

tissue of my lips onto the soot-black metal

when I wrap my mouth around it

and inhale lungfulls of exhaust

with desperate heaving gasps 

that wrack my chest like spasms

and burst the vessels in my eyes

until the white of the sclera 

is replaced with a red hemorrhage

that spreads across my face like rust

and turns tears pink with blood

until black finally starts to creep

around the edges of my vision

and all I can see are twin streams

of smoke rising out of my nostrils



		٭



My grandfather takes me to the middle

of our property

has been cleared for the pipeline 

that now runs beneath where we stand. 

*This is where we’ll plant it.* He says.

*You’re too young to know it

*but things are about to get real bad.*

*We’re going to have to be able*

*to take care of ourselves.* He 

laughs. *You might just have*

*to do a little bit of real work.*

The ground is muddy

and has been cleared for twenty

yards on either side of us

where the mesquite forms a wall 

that stretches along the burn’s edge

for its entire length.

I notice that the mud

Has bubbled up in places

forming pools that give off

the dark

of chemical infiltration.

I imagine pushing my fingers

into the earth to make 

way for seed. Black

oil rushes in to fill the hole

eager to poison

I listen to my grandfather

knowing that whatever we plant

here will grow only briefly

if at all

be enough to sustain us.

I agree that some horrible 

change is coming

but it will be slower

and more real 

than my grandfather

believes. I’ve seen it 

with a closeness

he isn’t strong enough for.

I know it in a way he will refuse

to until it has him

because of the way it reeks

of shit and piss

and because it is humiliating

and difficult and lets you know

in no uncertain terms

that you must face it alone.

It is boring

unemotional

and guilt over that relief.

It is selfish

quickly forward and is soon

unashamed of it

because pain is only truly

real when it is your pain

and nothingness cannot

be truly real for anyone

and because it is so easy 

to dwell on other things.

Old fields lay fallow

the crops of the past

are consumed and forgotten.

The ground is poison

it kills all its children. 



		٭ 


I say it again




		٭ 



I can smell summer coming

in the wind

over the lake and sweetened

by the cattail

reeds circling the water.

It catches dovecalls

the low cicada-hum

and I know the heat

is not far off now


that our brief respite

is drawing to a close

that I am once again

tilting to face the sun.

I spin toward summer

growing restless

Even the wind knows it.



		٭



I say it again



		٭



24 hours without sleep

and the lights are burning 

out my night vision

I can feel them like needles

behind my eyes

I smash the headlights

and walk over the shards

in my bare feet



		٭



I’m in the back

of the ambulance

with a patient while we

transport him to the hospital

but he is screaming

he won’t stop and my god

he’s been at it the whole ride

I make sure the straps

fastening him to the stretcher

are secure

then open the back doors

and roll him out

onto the blaring

freeway where he is hit

by the oncoming traffic



		٭



I deliver a baby

on the floor of a project apartment

surrounded by the stinking 

refuse of its tenants

I stare at empty mcdonalds

bags and cups and napkins

as I push both thumbs

through the soft spot

of the infant’s head



		٭ 



I return to the city just ahead of the rain.

The smell of it is heavy in the air



I return to the city always

trapped in the dark

liminality



between opposing fronts

static and useless

and beginning to stagnate;

reduced



to a desperate collection

of hair and skin

knocked about 

by the wind

as all the flailing

token resistance

is slowly and perfectly

robbed of force

and of meaning

until there is only

resignation—



a lifting of closed eyes

some final moments

spent as a living

ground for the storm’s

unthinking energy.

    and you don't answer at the door

    with the doormat until I find the spare key.

    Your apartment

    feels like a photograph

    and floating dust. 

    And I know.


    The bathroom is shut

    and the lights are on

    and it's quiet. Part of me

    wants you to be alright

    shaving your legs 

    in the bathtub. Part of me

    wants the waiting to stop

    to stop breathing the dust

    of your painted life.


    I think of when I first laid eyes on you
    
    three years ago

    sitting on a park bench

    dressed in August heat. And how part of me

    thought

    don't look at me 

    so I can still turn around. 

    And how the other part screamed:

    look at me or I'll die.


    (Don't they say the end

    is only as good 

    as the beginning?)


    When I open the door

    and see you on the linoleum floors

    covered in red

    like organ pipes and eyes

    like the deep end of the pool

    like the step you take

    after you turn the lights off

    I fold myself over you

    and remember two nights ago

    when I combed your hair

    it smelled like strawberries

    but darker
    
    and just as sweet

    and you cried

    and I told you to stay

    and you said

    where am I going?


    (I remember you told me

    that when you were young

    you used to let your balloons go

    on purpose.)


    When I look up at the ceiling

    to see the last thing you saw

    speckled off-white

    I hope that the part of you

    that wanted to let go

    wasn't the part that kissed my neck

    in the middle of the night.

    Your family didn’t understand  
    That I refused  
    To simply be bent and worn

    Of my left hand.  

    But the truth is I’m already worn  
    By so many people I no longer know  
    Like a hoody left behind after a one-night-stand.  

    As hard as I’ve tried  
    To keep myself contained  
    In each escape  
    I’ve spilled over  
    And given parts of me away.  
    And I resent

    Has my virginity screwed up  
    In a pile of dirty washing on his floor.  
    And someone somewhere  
    Has my favourite place by the river  
    Pushed back amongst the rubbish in his chest of drawers.  
    And someone somewhere  
    Wears my favourite song so smugly  
    Every time  
    I see his fucking face contort  
    That fucking grin that says  
    “I know you”  
    In a way  
    I can’t displace.  

    So when you tried to take my name  
    I told you no 
    As it would only be  
    Another part of me I can’t reclaim.  

    I’ve learned to hold on tight

There is always the opinion that one isn't able to say what is ""good"" and what is ""bad"" art. The explanation is invariably because someone *else* might find what you find distasteful tasty

Yes, and *at the time of its inception* it did have some **power** to it. But in this day and age (of infinite crap) it is a statement without testicles, or ovaries, and only breeds laziness in those who would create, and disinterest in those who would engage with what's been created.

If we want to speak of subjectivity and relativism then let us begin with the assumption that **there is value in the act of creating art.** This value is derived not from *quanta* but from *qualia.* 

Quanta is latin for ""how much?"" It is used by physicists to demarcate discrete values in any given phenome. To say that something is ""quantifiable"" usually means it can be objectively measured. Qualia, the color of dawn—these things are qualia, and their *communication* is subjective to the power of the consciousness which experiences them to reconstitute them in the consciousness of another—through music, poetry, painting, etc.

Of course one person will resonate with an artwork that another ""doesn't get."" That is not what is at issue here. What is at issue is the ability of the poet to reconstitute and to evoke various states in the experience of the reader. That power has an inherent aspect to it (from whence the phrase ""A poet is born

Likewise, comes naturally in varying degrees, and needs to be trained in order to do the work of *examining what makes something work.* A poem is not a mechanism, but the trained and sensitive critic will be able to elicit its various (subtle) functions.

To speak to the ""Harry Potter"" generation—the poet is a magician. She summons not a spell with a specific effect (that would be rhetoric, as viewers, to measure the qualia of an artwork as though it were a quanta. We can speak of meter and content and context—the material manifestations of the ""actual"" poem, and comment on these in a rational manner. We can also approach the so-called meaning, that which is aesthetically pleasing in the artwork as through it were, as it were, a vibration and an emanation of a conscious state of being, and examining *that* we can extrapolate *why* we have had the reactions we've had.

This is quite an investment

And I really meant it

But
yet.

And when I swore my sincerity 

You thought it was only because you call me your boyfriend. 

.

We went to dinner in midtown

and you said it was great. 

You looked nice and it was just cold enough outside for

that sort of thing. 

When I left you called my close friend

to tell her just how bad it was

and how much more I could’ve done. 

.

I’ve been by your side in hospitals

When your mother kicked you out

When you were too sick and too tired

I wrote you A+ essays for your economics class (and I hate econ)

I waited up for you to get home from parties

Or from your 12 PM - 12 AM shifts at work

I made peace with your family who hated me

I wrote you songs and sang them to you in Penn Station

I studied your favorite poets and read your favorite books

But

I will never make you happy.

    seven months ago 

    that was sixteen minutes long. 

    The first twenty seconds 

    were you reminding me 

    to pick up some food 

    because all that was left in the fridge 

    were two rotten peaches. You had forgotten 

    to hang up then

    in your coat pocket.


    Fifteen and a half minutes 

    of you breathing. 

    I drank it in like cough syrup

    listening to it over and over and over again

    always stopping it 

    before it ended

    always stopping it 

    before you took the last breath.


    I lined up your things on my bookshelf 

    the way a doctor keeps objects 

    from foreign body surgeries

    the way kids keep their baby teeth

    in their sock drawer. 

    An old tube of lipstick

    a leather notebook

    a bottle of perfume

    wondering if I could fold them inside of me 

    like a Russian nesting doll.


    I put them in my car one morning 

    and drove out to the lake 

    and threw them in

    I played the voicemail 

    to the end 

    and heard your heartbeat 

    stop 

    and watched the sky 

    turn to mist around me: 

    the view of the world 

    through an old lace-trimmed blouse.
 

    I remember reading somewhere 

    that watching the fog rise in the morning 

    was just like watching 

    a human soul 

    evaporate.

Nothing changes. The next day

Last month something pretty wild happened that changed my perspective of poetry as an uber-niche medium. I posted Tryken's [awesome analysis]( http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/18vssc/tryken_shows_the_difference_between_a_good_and/) to r/depthhub and the thing went on to reach the top 25 submission of all-time. Poetry, they had to subscribe to r/poetry!

I'm sure we can all imagine how that went.

It's funny how

The FIX: For anyone to post a poem

This should have several effects. First being a certain massive cut-down on what is essentially spam. You must put in some work for your poem to be submitted. If you don't want to contribute to the community

Second

Speaking of which

And what if we had a feedbacker of the week? We vote who gives the most effortful

All of this requires more effort. A higher level of engagement. But that's what we want

**EDIT FOR CLARITY and SPECIFICALS:**

The one main mechanic I'm proposing is that to submit a poem

It could be as easy as at the end of every submitted poem

someone was there.  
Oblivious
it was the tinted glasses
and simplify the growing,  
hot,

she just drew me instead.  




Three months later I fell for a boy that took my word for truth  
yet sat and pondered the origin of truth for hours.  
Masturbation
a patience that could appreciate what the fast-moving eye sped by  
each day. Some other lover could have taken a drag
and shared his gentle way but  
I had no time for benefits of mind and body.  




Five months past and then I was in the cross hairs of an  
armed woman that had the strength to sprint  
with ten thousand bricks on her back and  
never quit
to those who laid in her path.  
So they kept on piling bricks and countless lovers were charred
til I laid down
Overwhelming, but with a burning passion that  
none had yet to survive.  
I quit since she couldn't kill me.  




It wasn't two weeks before I locked eyes with a boy that cried when I cried  
and needed to be squeezed as tightly as possible
A fragile sapling that
I lead his roots to the clear
He grew

He wants to believe  
the sweet shimmer
the ideal island
his perceived paradise.


The bright birds sing softly  
calling from the cool canopy.  
Beneath
Life teems amidst the rolling desert.


His briny tears sting  
his parched eyes  
while he bobs up  
and down  
disoriented.  


All there is
and hope he lands  
before the shimmer fades.  
or he drowns.  


A man stranded at sea  
drinks salt water  
until he is mad.

1375129749.0,1jathr,[ Rape Joke ] A Poem by Patricia Lockwood,parthuman,53,11,19,"*Not for feedback. Full poem below.*

**Rape Joke**

&gt; The rape joke is that you were 19 years old.

&gt; The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend.

&gt; The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.

&gt; Imagine the rape joke looking in the mirror,” it thinks. “Yes. A goatee.”

&gt; No offense.

&gt; The rape joke is that he was seven years older. The rape joke is that you had known him for years, to assimilate, and to spit back out in different form through his goateed mouth.

&gt; Then suddenly you were older

&gt; The rape joke is that you had been drinking wine coolers. Wine coolers! Who drinks wine coolers? People who get raped

&gt; The rape joke is he was a bouncer

&gt; Not you!

&gt; The rape joke is that he carried a knife

&gt; He wasn’t threatening you

&gt; The rape joke is he once almost murdered a dude by throwing him through a plate-glass window. The next day he told you and he was trembling

&gt; How can a piece of knowledge be stupid? But of course you were so stupid.

&gt; The rape joke is that sometimes he would tell you you were going on a date and then take you over to his best friend Peewee’s house and make you watch wrestling while they all got high.

&gt; The rape joke is that his best friend was named Peewee.

&gt; OK

&gt; Like the dude was completely in love with The Rock. He thought it was so great what he could do with his eyebrow.

&gt; The rape joke is he called wrestling “a soap opera for men.” Men love drama too

&gt; The rape joke is that his bookshelf was just a row of paperbacks about serial killers. You mistook this for an interest in history

&gt; It gets funnier.

&gt; The rape joke is that he kept a diary. I wonder if he wrote about the rape in it.

&gt; The rape joke is that you read it once,” not since he met you. Close call, Miss Geography!

&gt; The rape joke is that he was your father’s high-school student—your father taught World Religion. You helped him clean out his classroom at the end of the year

&gt; The rape joke is that he knew you when you were 12 years old. He once helped your family move two states over, and he was kind to you, and you talked the whole way. He had chaw in his mouth the entire time, and you told him he was disgusting and he laughed, and spat the juice through his goatee into a Mountain Dew bottle.

&gt; The rape joke is that come on

&gt; The rape joke is that you were facedown. The rape joke is you were wearing a pretty green necklace that your sister had made for you. Later you cut that necklace up. The mattress felt a specific way, but you know you were not. As if your mouth were open ten years into the future, reciting a poem called Rape Joke.

&gt; The rape joke is that time is different

&gt; Just like the body

&gt; You know the body of time is elastic

&gt; The rape joke is that of course there was blood

&gt; The rape joke is you went home like nothing happened, and that was the rape joke.

&gt; It was a year before you told your parents, “I absolve you of your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,” which even in its total wrongheadedness, was so completely sweet.

&gt; The rape joke is that you were crazy for the next five years, and whole days went down into the sinkhole of thinking about why it happened. Like you went to look at your backyard and suddenly it wasn’t there, and you were looking down into the center of the earth, which played the same red event perpetually.

&gt; The rape joke is that after a while you weren’t crazy anymore

&gt; The rape joke is that for the next five years all you did was write, about apples on the tree, about islands, dead poets and the worms that aerated them, and there was no warm body in what you wrote, it was elsewhere.

&gt; The rape joke is that this is finally artless. The rape joke is that you do not write artlessly.

&gt; The rape joke is if you write a poem called Rape Joke

&gt; The rape joke is that you asked why he did it. The rape joke is he said he didn’t know, which made you laugh out loud for one long split-open second. The wine coolers weren’t Bartles &amp; Jaymes, but it would be funnier for the rape joke if they were. It was some pussy flavor, like Passionate Mango or Destroyed Strawberry, which you drank down without question and trustingly in the heart of Cincinnati Ohio.

&gt; Can rape jokes be funny at all

&gt; Can any part of the rape joke be funny. The part where it ends—haha, and telling it that way.

&gt; The rape joke cries out for the right to be told.

&gt; The rape joke is that this is just how it happened.

&gt; The rape joke is that the next day he gave you Pet Sounds. No really. Pet Sounds. He said he was sorry and then he gave you Pet Sounds. Come on

&gt;Admit it.

If a time traveler swapped my adolescent brain I'd be asking you how.

How could you?

I've been racking my brain to find answers for years

The pool of confusion you and mom created were built with my tears

I remember laying in my bunk bed

Because the things you were yelling at mom was too hard to hear.

I didn't understand.

My pillow was my microphone when I was speaking to God.

And my prayers were never audible because they came out in sobs.

And when my baby brother came to me for answers

What do you say? The things I was thinking I couldn't convey.

He was your son

And for those rocky divorce years

I sheltered him from the hate

But it's hard to do that when you're in the kitchen and we're above.

I've cursed the loft of our house a thousand times

Being built for echoing

I didn't understand

""Don't listen to your mother

Everything you know about her

I don't know where we'll live son

Just don't tell your brother; it's nothing to worry him about.""

When I heard that

And back then I thought I deserved it

Maybe if I cleaned my room more and did chores around the house

You'd put the bottle down and not fight with your spouse.

I was a lost cause

So I protected him at all costs

He wouldn't wind up like me.

Fucked in the head

But looking back on it years later

I want to blame you but I love you with all my heart.

I want to hate you but where can I start?

The feelings I had when I was a kid can't be erased

But the emotions I have now seem like they can't be faced.

So I pick up the bottle and start to take your place.

I realize now how you dealt with yourself

Grabbing another beer bottle from the top of the shelf.

It feels good for now

Every drop and every sip of you is like another death  
All over again like every other time   
  
I wanted to die and now it hurts to speak  
Like I can hardly squeeze out a penstroke to describe  
The incredible
  
If I could turn tears to wine I would drink them   
My old friend
So many sleeping fits and insomniatic bouts  
  
Of insanity that I could hardly confine
Here is I so tired and tired and tired and giving it all away  
To a sigh like a drink of something greater
  
My god and my killer
Creeps its way into my eyes like a plague which unwraps me  
And ties me up again in the most illogical ways  
  
A pressure beats behind my skull like a stave  
Containing ten hot notes and twenty hard beats  
With a rhythm I can hardly contain  
  
In the confined space between the walls of a glass  
Between lid and bottle and the start  
Of a new kind of agony
  
Broken
And every pledge I made to myself  
Every confession of disorder and dedication to reform  
  
I yawn
For the evening
Vessel of pure poision that I cannot refuse  
  
I cannot put down this fucking
This transparent demon in whose claws is clasped  
My still slowed and dulled yet raw and beating heart  
  
Whose ventricles do reject me as if I  
The lover, tumour benign  
Whose eyes claw for a new quip
  
To exemplify the heinous terror I describe  
Delirium tremens worms its way into my mind  
Rots away my brain until I can no longer stigmatise  
  
My actions with a sublime kind of fucked-upness   
That exists beyond the watchful
Of my bastard father who drinks of this turbid swamp of mine  
  
Paris is like a faraway island
For a cheaper price and a song for the throat of a singing bird  
Pardon me
  
What disturbed the life-long coma-like sleep I carved  
Like a cave into the street where my casing curiously parked   
Like a suburban nightmare broken down and write-off sedan car  
  
The last hour was ticking by like sand on sand  
And my gospels lies
To envelop the simple death I understand  
  
In an ethereal vine that god himself  
Could not force to bring forth the rose  
Once again the miserable sod revolved and in a mystery took repose

    I apologize;
    
    but you do not embody beauty
    nor
    the richest of diamonds
    or a summer’s day.
    
    This is disingenuous
    not to beauty
    but to you.
    
    Without you
    would just be weeds
    worthless chunks of carbon
    a sweaty working condition.
    
    Without you
    of beauty, loyalty, and 
    
    
    I would never get laid.

Of a Koi fish that swam upstream
Beating its flesh against the rocks
To the top of a wicked mountain    
It leapt over the gate    
And was transformed into a dragon    
Whose scales could stop arrows

We looked
Death became terrible to you and me.  
By love we disenthralled our natural terror  
From every comfortable philosopher  
Or tall
Death stood at last in his true rank and order.  


It happened soon
Exchange of gifts grew to a malady:  
Their worth rose always higher on each side  
Till there seemed nothing but ungivable pride  
That yet remained ungiven
Called a conclusion not to be denied.  


Then we at last bethought ourselves
And simultaneously this final gift  
Gave: each with shaking hands unlocks  
The sinister,  
Unwraps pure death
As greeted our love's first accomplishment.

    Already
    I am compelled to write you more poetry
    Than I ever felt for him

    For the boy who I professed to love
    There were never any phrases
    At risk of spilling over
    of flooding past my lips;

    Rushed away in the makeshift vessels 
    Of tangled
    No desperate syllables were commandeered
    To set any frantic feelings free

    And I know your sleepy eyes
    Will float through these lines and find no place to rest
    (You'll send me edits
    Because you think you know how words work best)

    But that doesn't change the fact
    That this morning
    Waiting patiently
    For the credit

    Whatever these words earn me    
    Those are the wages I will take
    It is important that these things are said
    If only for honesty's sake

    I am waiting for you to wake up and exist

I wandered till I lost my way 

I roamed into a hollow tree 
and questioned where my path could be.


My life had brought me little joy
and Nature made me Satan's toy 

A heap of ashes was my bed. 
The Devil's home was in my head 

My knees were weak. I kissed the ground 
and prayed that Wisdom could be found. 
            
            -------

I swallowed and the world was new. 
My ravaged frame knew what to do 

I danced the dance of endless years 
and boxed the furry rabbit's ears 

The sky was Drunk! The endless sea 
was Soma's crimson canopy 

The air was gold
and foolish Satan could be seen 

A hill of leaves
the Prince of Demons was insane 

I said
your empty heart: you cannot hide."" 

Said Satan: ""Poor
you're Selfish Soma's simple tool 

This echo-ridden empty hall 
is not my blessed heart at all 

Accept my eyes and you will see: 
you live inside a hollow tree!"" 

The King of Lies had spoken well. 
That tree had been my living Hell 

That lonely
that prison was the world to me 

My rage had helped me burrow through
then Reason told me what to do 

I stood beside that lonely tree - 
that frail

And said: “My tree has lost its roots. 
My Soul remembers tasting fruits"" 

I hacked its limbs and cleaved its head. 
I killed the fruitless sylvan Ted 

And to its bones I brought the Flame
and felt my Soul become the same 

I said a prayer for wasted years
and burned away my baseless fears 

               ------- 

So that was what I used to be
that lonely

That blazed upon its funeral pyre: 
I was that tree - but now I'm Fire.

1325161677.0,nuuwc,A Quick Guide to Punctuation in Poetry,SetDarknessEchoing,42,7,68,"From giving feedback to people and reading submissions here

Firstly, if there is no punctuation, there is no break and it just keeps being read as one sentence until there is punctuation to denote a pause or a stop.

    To prove my point I'm just typing
    out some random stuff to show you
    
    what happens when you don't use punctuation
    this is meant to be a new sentence but in reality
    because I didn't punctuate properly you had to read
    and are continuing to have to read this all as if it is
    one massively long sentence with no commas or full stops
    which it really shouldn't be
    You see sometimes people think just a capital letter is enough
    but no punctuation means no stops
    and after a while you lose the meaning behind
    your poem

Yeah I know, did you pause briefly? Add a comma. Did you stop? Full stop. Did you ask a question? Question mark. 

Another point

Ellipses are not designed to just denote a pause in speech

1.  Denote the omission of a word or phrase
2.  Indicate an unfinished thought
3.  Inspire a feeling of melancholy longing

Just be careful then to use them sparingly. Punctuation to denote an unfinished thought and/or a feeling of melancholy is a priceless tool in poetry, go back and change it to a full stop, comma or even an em dash.

Lastly, once you start removing punctuation for stylistic effect, you need to take your form, diction and syntax up a gear. It's not enough to write a poem then go through and remove all the commas and such. The whole design of the poem (from the very start of the writing of it) needs to be fitted around the removal of punctuation. 

Take this [classic example](http://www.internal.org/e_e_cummings/Buffalo_Bills). Note how he forces the words 'onetwothreefourfive' together then 'pigeonsjustlikethat'. He is forcing you to speed up, almost like punctuation in reverse.

I know this is a lot for just one post but it should give people something to think about when writing their next piece hopefully. If anyone has anything else to add

Their eyes looked so dead! Their spirits wore thin!

They fought like wild dogs as they dug through the bin!

Bakery put out cakes draped with ribbon and bow

But those soon became trampled like the fresh-fallen snow.

As the store was destroyed by a cruel

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.

He was chubby and plump

And he laughed when we saw all that he had defiled.

A twitch in my eye

Destroying the store

And laying his finger aside of my nose

Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

Marble-heavy

Ghastly statue with one gray toe

Big as a Frisco seal

.

And a head in the freakish Atlantic

Where it pours bean green over blue

In the waters off beautiful Nauset.

I used to pray to recover you.

Ach

In the German tongue

Scraped flat by the roller

Of wars

But the name of the town is common.

My Polack friend

So I never could tell where you

Put your foot

I never could talk to you.

It stuck in a barb wire snare.

I thought every German was you.

And the language obscene

An engine

Chuffing me off like a Jew.

A Jew to Dachau

I began to talk like a Jew.

I think I may well be a Jew.

Are not very pure or true.

With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck

And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack

With your Luftwaffe

And your neat mustache

And your Aryan eye

Panzer-man

Not God but a swastika

So black no sky could squeak through.

Every woman adores a Fascist

The boot in the face

Brute heart of a brute like you.

You stand at the blackboard

In the picture I have of you

A cleft in your chin instead of your foot

But no less a devil for that

Any less the black man who

Bit my pretty red heart in two.

I was ten when they buried you.

At twenty I tried to die

And get back

I thought even the bones would do.

.

But they pulled me out of the sack

And they stuck me together with glue.

And then I knew what to do.

I made a model of you

A man in black with a Meinkampf look

.

And a love of the rack and the screw.

And I said I do

So daddy

The black telephone's off at the root

The voices just can't worm through.

If I've killed one man

The vampire who said he was you

And drank my blood for a year

Seven years

Daddy

There's a stake in your fat black heart

And the villagers never liked you.

They are dancing and stamping on you.

They always knew it was you.

What would it be like to fade away?

Like sand stained dark in a tidal bay.

A footprint leaves its mark and name. 

Like those scratched onto a lonesome grave.

Forgotten

What would it be like to fade away?


What would it be like when love is gone?

When life has been lived for far to long.

When you cant remember a name or face.

But try with the hope to retain your grace.

Cause you survived

What would it be like when love is gone?


What would it be like to fade away?

Not be here tomorrow to see another day.

Nor feel the suns comforting embrace. 

Like warm tears upon your face.

The wait is dark and I’m afraid.

What would it be like to fade away?


What would it be like to say goodbye?

Knowing it might be for the last time.

Tomorrow will be remembered for when I died.

Not leaving anything dear behind

I leave childless and without a bride.

What would it be like to say goodbye?


What would it be like to fade away?

Like the toll of bells when there is no more sway

Silent and unheard with no more strain

The hammer won’t strike to cause them pain

They are at easy if only for an hour or day

What would it be like to fade away?

What would it be like without this weight?

Could it be my whole life would dilate?

I feel as though I don’t have the traits 

To be among those who pass the cut rate

How many times do I need to reiterate

What would it be like with out this weight?


What would it be like to fade away?

Like the beauty of a dying bouquet.

Not like the bells whom endure their pain.

It cannot be washed away with rain.

I once tried to say goodbye 

It came at the end of a string tie

There is no name that bares my lace

When time runs out ill loose all face

My crime was life

No one tends to the lonesome grave

Unlike the footprint gone the next day

Do I need permission so that I may

And left butts on the pews

He wrote a poem

And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""

Because that was the question about his girl

And thats what it was all about

And his professor gave him an A

And a strange steady look

And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door

Because he never showed her

That was the year Father Tracy died

And he forgot how the end

Of the Apostles's Creed went

And he caught his sister

Making out on the back porch

And his mother and father never kissed

Or even talked

And the girl around the corner

Wore too much make up

That made him cough when he kissed her

But he kissed her anyway

Because it was the thing to do

And at 3 am he tucked himself into bed

His father snoring soundly
 

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag

He tried another poem

And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""

Because that's what it was really all about

And he gave himself an A

And a slash on each damned wrist

And he hung it on the bathroom door

Because this time he didn’t think

He could reach the kitchen

Merciless

Time may heal our wounds

But in the end it decides to end our lives

Wastes away mountains

    He left me fineries and a name
    But did not think to give what made him great—
    His poet's tongue and his lover's heart.
     
    My father was a great lover
    He spread his love as freely as his seed
    And gave up its fruits with cold abandon.
     
    I had no more a place in his heart than a place at his side.
    I was not his glorious boy
    Merely a sickly girl with his devils in my blood.
     
    My mother carved arithmetic into my skull as an exorcism
    Until every creak of the floorboards beneath the carpet
    And every gust of wind through the branches became a whisper of numbers
    A simple equation that never added up. 
     
    He did not leave me his heart
    But instead his ghost settled in mine.
     
    My father's vanities sharpened my coarse tongue
    They could slip rings on my fingers and call me a lady
    But I would never be so proud as when I heard the whispers
    Of how my wicked mouth had the same curve as his.
     
    I had no place in his heart but a place by his deathbed is enough.

When the World ends




And the bombs have exploded




And all is said and done




Maybe there will be wildflowers. 





“Do we have to kill each other?”




Asked the little boy to the old man. 




“Yes




“But we’ll come back”




“Humans are resilient like that.”





An invasive species works its way




Through the cracks 




And doesn’t stop until it has 




Completely




No




Insidiously




Wresting,  




Made itself home. 





Don’t we know where we’ve come from?




Isn’t that how it always works?




When will we ever realize that history 




Is a record that winds down until there




Is nothing but static and pop until 




Someone flips it over?





Maybe in the quiet of our own self-destruction




When nothing is left but embers and regret




There will still be wildflowers




And a new invasive species will slowly take hold.

    toward you from the steel in his hand.

    back your hair or hers—
    
    Until she shrieks through teeth
    that could be yours. Wings 
    burst out red onto the white sheets—

    Your twin sister’s voice is a bell in your head. 
    You stumble for help
    too late

    ii.

    You wade through sun-broken grass
    in velvet

    Flies in black mourning clothes 
    circle above your house 
    calling Gloria

    They welcome your sister. Buzzed

    Child
    of angels: even the cicada must leave 
    its body behind to fly away.

So

I must add, poetry competitions will become a much more prominent feature on this subreddit. I think the next step is to start making each competition more defined, for example, one for specific forms (e.g. Sonnets, Free Verse etc), one for poems about specific subjects and potentially a Performance Poetry contest (we'd need someone qualified to judge that however, I don't have the expertise


Notes on the judging (for those who are interested)-

I read all entries thoroughly before creating a shortlist. The poems on this list were then judged by two other poets/critics who each selected a top two from the list (this was to remove as much judging bias as possible

The standard of the poetry submitted was also to a high level everyone

It was the  
notion that time  
stopped  
when i turned off  
my eyes.  
  
------------------------------------
It was  
when i found out  
that his truth

was filled with venom  
  
that  
I began to look  
past the atrophy of  
democracy.  
  
--------------------------------------
And I fell asleep  
in the midst  
 of buying groceries.
  

And his  
Children will cry   
forever
waiting for me to   
bring them candy  
and plastic.

--------------------------------------
His Children
will cry forever
their boiled  
stomachs  
  
hang  -
ing out  
(At arms length)  
 Waiting for Legions  
 and equity  

-----------------------------------

Waiting for  
mix drinks  

and billiard balls in  
the   
  
glory-hole back  
  
rooms  
  
of catholicism.  

--------------------------------------
Each one of  
his Children   
turned to granite.  
  
at the first sign   
  
of Java Script.  And i  
held their hand
they uploaded  
pictures of mirrors.  

--------------------------------------

But then i let go of  
their hand  
when i  
saw  
  
that those Children be  
came grownups at the  
  
first sign of mitigating  
  
circumstance.

----------------------------------------
It wasn't a dis  
ease that  
set me free.  
  
It was  
the irony  
i let go of.  
  
It was  
a landfill  
that i fell in love with.  

--------------------------------------
  
it was a tire iron
a mail box that sent  
  
my wisdom through  
dream states of ivory  
  
silence.  
  
It was his Child
fall off that bridge.   

----------------------------------
It was a  
shoe i let walk  
 away
  
 and it was  
  
He who.  
watched
  
  
as i slept.

I spent close four and half  
 months working over the words in this poem. I then took two weeks to size out the layout and the film for the screen print.  Finally giving myself a weekend to cut / fold / stitch and ship 25pc.  The following gallery is a Screen Printed version of the poem.  Afterwards is a video of me stitching one of the final prints.

I planned on telling anyone who asked

Which is sort of true. No one asked.

were just okay

I thought maybe my poems were too.

It's not my fault if they're good or bad


Some bums passed by me on the bridge

And they had their bum lives and bags

filled with whatever they were filled with.

It was a lot like the word - sonder

He thought of his life

one he could do without.

His heart grew dry

and began to split with cracks.

He lost himself;

could he never go back?

But his heart hurt too much; 

he had to take control. 

So he thought of the things 

that made his heart whole. 

Then he closed his eyes

took a big leap of faith... 

And ended up on the other side safe. 

His heart opened up

and he took off his shell

and he said with a smile

'I made it through hell.' 

And he urged all the others

to take the same chance. 

And some did

and they smiled and danced. 

So happy was he

to beat back his mask.

Amongst the darkest coral spires

In murky

A world of fierce aquatic liars

Of thieves

A catfish shouts

A beaten trout

A ratfish squeals,

The slut-fish gives the man-fish crabs

The underworld of undersea

Where crime and brine entwine with glee

Then find their minds combined and freed

By hydroponic-kind sea-weed

The only schools you’ll find don’t teach

They bully whales up onto beach

A cruellest rule of a sorry sea

Devoid of all authority

Mermaid hookers deck the corn’

They yawn and mourn the ocean dawn

Against the backlit shops

With porn and prawn

The octopi,

A screaming

They ink her face with blackened stench

Her grave; the Mariana Trench

The Killer Whale is born to kill

He spares no time for fucking krill

He lusts for flesh before it’s stale

He’s not some fucking soft-cunt whale

He goes to where the tuna be

And live and play and chew the reed

He’ll seize the Orca-tunity

To feed his greed while tuna bleed

Anemone play violent pimp

To teenage

While coward dolphins dive for air

It seems they feel much safer there

The land; it’s such a safer bet

“We’ve sure evolved to walking yet?”

So sick of crime and fear and wet

And porn and prawn and scorched regret

A nurse shark slips prescription drugs

To starving,

The stingray scrounge the silty depths

Jacked up on coke and crystal meth

A swim-by-sting

In Flounder's Field

But one each hour

In coral spiked like devil's horn

In this cruel world of fish and prawn

And death and crime

And hate and fear and dust and scorn

""Do all to stay away!"" they warn

From porn and prawn

And porn and prawn

The eve before Salvation's dawn

Will reek of porn

**On a day like any other….**

On a day like any other
they two wait like beetles   
in the dark
for the light
so that scuttling
seek the dark

She would welcome death - his!  
And so would he.  
Instead he milks her breast of scorn  
and wants his pillow fluffed
dark stained and damp  
with ancient tears.  

On a day like any other
she bellows broad  
the aching of their days
charging strangers dear   
with uttered pain for sympathy.  

No friend in this small house
none
the apparatus of a dying man
hid well in drawers  
and capsuled dreams.  

On a day like any other
he lies unfinished
a cankered doll
and lost
but for she who tears his ears  
and pokes his eyes  
seeking his mortality.  

On a day like any other....

**The Bird**

A bird flew into my life with a thud  
and died.  

The window
unyielding

At my desk with thoughts diffuse  
it broke into my life  
with its neck.  

It fell on impact
and fell again

It was warm
and dead in a bloody pool.  

I buried it under the bottlebrush.   
When it flowers in spring  
 and the honey eaters come  
 to feed on the sweetness  
 of the flowers.  
I will remember the death.  
I know that I will.

and in the brightness of her face
and in her soft and simple grace
I found a truly gorgeous space.    

And there I basked in the sweet glow    
of beauty I'd just come to know;    
completely caught up in the flow    
of new life bright as white is snow.    

But,    
and soon our bond came to expire
and so she left; my sole supplier    
of life-transforming

I try so hard now to erase    
the memory of her embrace
and image of her shining face
and aura of her gentle grace.    
I try so hard but can't efface;    
I try so hard but can't displace
not even one damned single trace    
of how she filled that sacred space.    

The world is dark without her light
my brightest day has turned to night
her memory's a constant plight;    
a burden I've no strength to fight.    
Now if that burden would ignite
the fiery blaze would reach great height
from brilliant flames
sunlight'd

But it's no chance of catching fire
no matter how much I desire
A phoenix's rebirth won't transpire
instead

Not one star shines
and luminance my soul lacks too.    
Moments of peace I have are few
and my stay here is far from through.    

Now I explore depths of my mind
in hope that
what continues in me to bind    
to those that I must leave behind.

Your blue eyes  
your cherubic lips
skin like ivory
your aura of confidence
though mixed with a vulnerable femininity
drove me crazy
made my head go hazy.
I could not think straight    
with you on my mind.

My feelings are fathoms deeper than that  
of the ocean blue
Warmer than the surface of the sun itself  
and truer
That man has ever spoken.

makes my heart beats faster  
than any beat of a drum  
you make me feel higher  
than any bird can fly.

each one different,  
let every verse be like a kiss
though one I cannot give
but setting your inner passions alight.  




Till I see your face again
Do not lose your beauty;  
Those deep blue eyes
Its hue
nor your smile
or your vibrance

parting ways
I finish with a kiss that i cannot give
forgive me for my mistakes

like a purple and yellow insect who has developed no poison as a defense    
standing up on a rock to announce itself to a desert floor -    

an evolutionary hiccup of a squire
but finds himself eviscerated on a mead-hall dance-floor    

like when I was 8 years old and a loose shoe-lace snagged in my bike-chain    
sending me to the asphalt cheek-bone first

but the insect that other eaten generations have made me is not purple and yellow.    
I am an unnoticable shade of brown with pink highlights

easy to lose in the rocks and dunes
never grace mountainfaces, let science sleep in the bed it has made.

It's good that I didn't call   
Good that I didn't say too much.    

Some things are hard to give up    
Sometimes it's hard to let go    
But I'm giving up
All sorts of things

I don't drive anymore    
And I don't eat that much    
But I do smoke a lot more    
Cigarettes and drink    
Beer.    
But I always drank    
Plenty of beer.    

I imagine I'm some sort of    
Drinking smoking monk    
Living in the kind of solitude    
You get when you unplug    
And quit calling.   

I gave up television    
Except for Back to the Future reruns.    
Instead I read old books    
I try to make notes in the margins.    

I haven't written any music    
In a long time. My guitars    
Are neglected

It's been a month since we spoke    
And I don't want to talk to you    
But I would like to know    
that you miss me.    

I don't miss you.    
I gave up missing you weeks ago    
When I washed your perfume     
Out of my pillowcases     
Exorcised your lingering ghosts.     

Every time I clean I find something    
A relic    
A stupid rubber wristband    
That fell behind the bed     
Or a ponytail holder    
Underneath my journal.    

Sequins keep showing up.    
I pick them out of the carpet    
and a few days later    
Find another.    

Something tells me    
Memories are like waves    
And mine are stirring the floor    
And washing these bits of you up    
Pushing them out of the ocean of our yesterdays   
And onto my little bit of shore.    

Sunday night (after I drank too much)    
I found five sequins    
and held them all in my palm.    
They were a constellation    
Shaped like summer    
Like days laying out at the lake    
And nights when we couldn't cool off    
After we made love    
Spread out on the bed    
The air wafting in from the window    
Barely a whisper    
The smell of your sex   
And the taste of your sweat   
Lingering on my lips.

I looked at them too long    
Thought of you too much    
Came too close to dialing your number.    

That was as much of you    
As I'd held    
Since you left    
And when I held my hand    
Over the trash    
It was hard to let go.    ",,t5_2qhhu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/14kof7/its_hard_to_give_up_hard_to_let_go/

   And the trees have a silver glare;   
Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly
   And the harpies of upper air
   That flutter and laugh and stare.  

For the village dead to the moon outspread   
   Never shone in the sunset's gleam
But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep   
   Where the rivers of madness stream

A chill wind blows through the rows of sheaves

   Spreads sleep o'er the cosmic throne

And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray
   Sprung out of the tomb's black maw   
   To shake all the world with awe.  

And all that the morn shall greet forlorn
   The ugliness and the pest   
Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick
   Shall some day be with the rest
   And brood with the shades unblest.

Poet 1:

Motion

    Narrow it down to the relativity
    Conscious of the extraordinarily vast periphery
    It's hard to fathom.
    Delay the slow onset realizations
    of your muscles sensations
    and take a good
    It's a strange notion.
    All that 
    motion.

Masturbation

    Some nights
    While I lay in bed
    in fact
    Well
    I'll do a quick one two
    As if I was performing.
    Just to see if anyone is home
    or they're all deep at rest.
    And of course
    It's more like training
    if training can include watching porn.

Poison

    One poison
    Two poison
    I'm getting cozy.
    Inhale deeply into my lungs
    Wash it down with a little rum.
    Three poison 
    Four poison
    Now I'm feeling fuckin' toasty
    and I'm getting a little aggressive with my language
    but once you get the hang of it
    it flows a little more smoothly
    I'm feeling a little woozy
    my thoughts are like the ice in a bucket
    and my words the fine wine I'm most certainly not drinking.
    But I can't stop thinking - ""Fuck she's hot""
    and someone just offered me another shot.
    So now it's 5 poison
    red poison
    I know the seventh was pinot noire
    but that blue stuff stung
    Hold up is that bro getting in a car?
    What a fuckin' goof
    that he's a douch
    myself
    I think I'll just chill on that window-sill.
    So I walked over there and and had a nasty fall.
    I shouldn't have mixed all that alcohol.

Poet 2:

Warcraft

    if all the witches in the world got together
    there'd be one hell of a shit storm
    spells
    its thoughts like these
    --holy shit! i just saw a boar--
    that i imagine as i walk through Elwynn 
    leaves rustling on the forest floor
    the path is growing narrow and... i see it
    looking down at my keys
    and cross that familiar bridge
    night falls fast on Westfall's mine
    dead- 
    the server sleeps

Lugubrious

    look at you
    you're so pathetic
    why are you even here?
    just leave this place
    -that thing you always hold so close
    we dont want it here
    ...and neither are you
    dont do it
    infect this world with your solemn looks
    your empty stares and depressing books

    we are not you

The way you always have free time to listen to others  
The way you stay late to help your coworkers

And the way you make sure every door and window is locked as soon as you get home.

How your dinner is always homemade and fresh  
How you will sometimes fall asleep while watching TV  
And I love the sound of your deep breaths as you lie sleeping.  


I love the look on your face when I accidentally startle you awake.

And I hate you.

I hate you because three years ago you said no and got that restraining order.

But you’ll see.  
One day you’ll love me back and I’ll remove the cameras.  
I’ll get rid of the GPS units I’ve hidden.

then I would know

we were over.

and drop all of the flowers you had given me-

No

not even dogs who were somebody's best friend. 

He’s graying now

when you brought him home.

You were eight years old

now you’re trying to be a man

and back at home he’s almost gone.

Will you be there to see him go?

Will he know you love him

Please

just play with your puppies while they’re still young.



And when your dog is dead and gone

find a new one

and try to love him even more

than you ever loved the one before;

and always remember

who come and go

your mother,

they won’t last long.

And all those family dinners will be done.

So while you’re home for Christmas

What seems so solid now will one day turn to ash.

So please

or fame or martyrdom;

just remember who loves you

So when you write down a poem, just try to do it dammit. I know it can be tiring and the results will be shitty for the first ten times, but after that the poem WILL sound better. After that, you may want to apply a simple rhyme scheme like ABAB, which is my favourite, just to train your ability to follow the rules. Does the poem sound clunky now? Well shit, son

Also rereading, and rewriting again, will work to make your poems better. Read the poem. Are there any parts which don't bear any meaning? Take 'em off, throw 'em in the bin. Reread. Anything you forgot to say, or any new ideas, any words that would fit better or sound better? Put 'em there. Just don't let the first draft be the final, cause son I can promise you, and then maybe synthesise the two poems. Again

So how much better is that poem now? Probably not much. But do this about ten or so times with different poems

    The Perfect Equation

    Before you ask about the grid

    to graph you out. I can’t simplify  you

    Warm in your grasp
    into a cozy alcove
    of your arm around my waist
    to me as you lead me to the backyard.

                being lost like you.

    tilting my earth out of orbit
    but you draw me  in like gravity. I am your skeptic
    angel
    I want to reach you. The arches of my feet lift up
    and when our lips intercept - 
     I am still obsessed  
                with the space in between us. 

    Before you start erasing your name
    from my variables
    to equations. I am  trying  to enclose you in brackets
    to pigeonhole you in my broken function.
    But you are mystery
    of brown eyes lit up with flecks of golden hieroglyphs.

    I am lost until I find on my map
    residing within the curve
                 of your ear to ear smile. 

    Before you start counting down from ten
    please be patient. I have a penchant for numbering
    our days
    Your worth is my absolute value
    shining bright this evening
    where stars are hung as fixtures
    like  a scattergram. In the mixture of these
    highlighted coordinates
    out of this blackness and
 		 call them constellations. 

    Before we continue our midnight adventure
    remember that with you
    I am whole with no remainder.
    So tonight
    that you untangle from my shirt’s holes. 
    I won’t measure the temperature 
    of your cold hands on my skin.
    When you kiss me I concede

    to the loot fits and rage quits    
    I say ""tough shit"".      
    I'd sooner be flirting with a murloc    
    than trying to find a soulmate in a guildmate.    

    But in the throne of tides
    it was a revelation;    
    I didn't think about meters once we met;     
    I just wanted to be exalted in your reputation.    

    not even a rude noob with no food and less clue could ruin your mood;       
    nor his roll on your blue boots upset your groove.   
    I tried to play a white knight in a black robe and voted to kick
    but you shut it down quick and whispered:    
    ""don't worry

    I logged on to your server on mumble
    and when I heard you my heart stumbled;

    No damsel

    (business before pleasure;     
    and I want you to know I can bring home the treasure;    
    I'm not saying you're a gold farmer
    but I want you to be a dwarf lady of leisure).    

    We can relax with a few potions while the griffins fly by
    and while you can't see my t-shirt with a tuxedo on it
    I can be suaver when we're dodging lava than in any fine lounge bar
    and more of a gentleman over webcam than any man since Adam.    

    I know it's our first level
    but I feel I could take on a boss fight.      
    Before this night
    I never believed in love before first sight.

I had a hard time choosing my favorite original piece from April

    Cold sea of concrete
    Rubber rivers
    tied with shoelace snakes
    The throaty chatter of steel stallions
    
    Blast
    This briefcase battalion 
    This trench coat warfare
    Holed up in your towers of glass
    
    Unsheathe the weapon
    Stabbing
    A letterhead phalanx
    Advance
    
    Not today my friend
    
    Not today


I love the *subtlety* of the speaker's voice. This is a subjective

But the speaker's words are powerful despite coming few in number. At first, he is doing so to communicate his weariness with the work world, his rejection of it. His experience has made him like a Vietnam vet, fed up and disillusioned, fighting PTSD and substance withdrawal. Mourning missing limbs. 

For economy of words, and ""Trench coat warfare"" is the kind of brilliant phrase that stops me in mid sentence. Solid, solid stuff. 

The second piece which really stood out last month was [""What Happened When You Left"" by madgearmisslekid](http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/syaeu/what_happened_when_you_left_feedback_welcome/). 

    At your betrayal
    My slavering dog rage
    led me on long walks
    to still places where
    I frightened off lovers
    and howled alone.

    Grief and I became
    as grudging friends then
    to trudge hand-in hand and
    stand eyes downcast by
    waters of slate-grey.

    I begged him always
    to help me forget
    and repeated washings
    buried your bright scent

    but with numb trembling
    chalk hands too weary
    to hold strength or purpose
    I would too often
    find your cruelties in
    keepsakes of love
    and your words left for me.

    Still the accusing walls
    scream more memories
    and our tiny refuge
    will never quite
    be my own home
    but it will never be
    truly empty.

    Your abscence
    is still here.
    
I wouldn't have chosen this poem if I had any choice in the matter because I've read 100 other poems on the subject of lost love in April and they were all *bad*. But this one avoids the cliche into which lost-love poems usually stumble - in fact

First

Similarly, they are too weak to *refrain* from grasping some physical things - old keepsakes. 

The most striking feature of this poem is its *progression*. It tightens over time into more and more claustrophobic expressions of grief, then they are taking walks alone with their grief. Soon they aren't even leaving the house, going through keepsakes and pacing around the same rooms used to hold their relationship. As the poet's world shrinks, the line length shrinks as well. It has the effect of someone turning inward, being compressed by their grief. 

On a side note

The poet says this took them four years to write

    Lend Me an Ear

    I went and sat by the shores today
    Out to see the waves
    Attempt to ease up tensions built
    My soul in disarray

    Heaven won't bestow on me
    The answers that I seek
    Stars neglect in unison
    Sky completely bleak

    This does not surprise me
    They weren't asked to fill this task
    I just came to see the tumbling water
    Clash on its own back

    In search of my serenity
    Beside an empting flask
    Basking in solitude merrily
    The waves won't let it last

    Repeating of its sorrows
    With each recurring splash
    It spoke before I got here
    Or anyone else at that

    Describes in utter detail
    Of all the nights so cold
    Extracted tales from memory
    To no one ever told

    The waves have heard
    But never an ear in sight
    ""Fear not!"" A roar unleashed by me
    Your streak ends here tonight

    I came to dwell on my own mishaps
    Perhaps a pain or two
    Yet
    By your endless brood

    I too never understood
    Why times can be so harsh
    Yet I know a weight has lifted
    Off your burdened heart

    You don't need an answer
    Just someone to hear
    I bet it's worth the trouble
    Contesting through the years

    For the moment you've recessed

With the sublime contour from your neck  
To your elbow

Drawing letters and lines gently
just barely touching  
While I imagine   
The life this shoulder will know in the future  
The beautiful garments that will fall upon it  
The feelings it will inspire
So lucky to lay eyes on it

Beside it

My smile is actually a grimace.





Stored in the locket round my neck


is all my pain and sorrow

I fall into the sky like a seltzer in a glass of water.

not like the muscle that twitches in my eye-lid





not like the crooked nail on my left toe.


My name is just a bunch of letters





but the mole between my pointer and index finger


reminds me that I am just a human.



I do not believe in God


though not nothing is holier than blossoms in the spring.





I am nineteen years old and still wish I could fly.


I promise to jump out of the first plane I ever ride in.





If I could have a super-power


it would be to go back in time to October 11th





to tear up those letters


and tell my parents how much I love them.

    There was a childhood of sticky fingers and chocolates stolen

    in the dark of night

    and eaten in delicious forbidden fear

    of being found

    and every day my grandmother 

    filled the house with the smell of hearty food

    because it was the only way she knew how to say 

    “I love you

    In the school lunchroom

    I was jealous of the kids with brown paper bags

    because I had clear tupperware with sandwiches

    that had meat so spicy that you could smell it

    all the way over on the other side of the room.

    There was birthday cake that I only had to share with two other people

    even though I had invited twelve.

    I swallowed gobs of sweet blue frosting that tasted so bitter.

    There were the lollipops that stayed in a bowl

    on the school psychologist’s little round table

    and as I answered questions like a vending machine

    giving out the answers I knew they wanted

    I stared at the lollipops and wondered if I could ask for one.

    I never did

    that I needed anything from them.    



    I remember two different summer camps

    floating in the space between elementary school and high school.

    For two weeks

    I rode horses and swam in small ponds full of snapping turtles

    and I couldn’t speak the language of all the girls in my cabin

    because I had never learned how to speak

    without a smarty-pants accent.

    I hated all the food there

    so for two weeks, and dinner,

    all I had was peanut butter on wonder bread.

    My mouth was too sticky to let me say

    “Please

    I just want to be friends

    I’m sorry that I’m not like you”.

    After two weeks of peanut butter and silence

    my thighs had turned into wonder bread

    soft and squishy

    and I went home and never ate peanut butter again.




    Two years later

    I went to fat camp in Pennsylvania

    and some sadistic bastard had put a camp

    full of girls with extra chins and heavy breath

    right next to a chocolate factory.

    .........................................................REALLY??!!

    When the skinny

    woke me up at 5:30 in the morning

    so that I could run for two miles

    the smell of chocolate hung in the air

    as heavily as the mist

    and with every sweaty pant

    I expelled while running around an endless track

    and gasping to keep up with yet another group of girls who rejected me

    I could taste nothing but sweet desire

    and I would run harder

    that if I could lose as much of myself as possible

    I would stop wanting

    wanting to eat

    wanting to be wanted

    But no matter how much I ran

    I never managed to lose even a bit of myself

    in pounds or in thoughts.




    Now I have a rest-of-my-life-hood

    of thinking of carbs and calories and sodium and trans fats

    and  the jiggly bits of my thighs and arms and stomach

    of eating vegetables and ignoring bread

    of avoiding eating in public because there’s a different kind of fear now

    of hating food

    that I cannot photosynthesize

    that no matter how far I stretch upwards toward the sun

    no matter if I can taste the wind across my skin

    I will never become a tree

    I will never be able to live off of air and sunlight

    I will never not be trapped in this useless body.

    I have learned what it means to be hungry.

Now, but I think a lot of people here are afraid to share their thoughts about a poem because they don't know how the author will react. 

I wonder if this could be mitigated by either a guideline in the side-bar that specifies tagging a post

In the dead moon streets

A war dance for the city

And whoop to the night

Like songs for Hiroshima

Full of terror

And when the dying dusk settles

We can run through the park

With our flashlights

Spraying shadows

Into the sleepless hours

Hanging like a fever

Of Summer's musk

Over our abstract medium

Our concrete jungle

Like faraway lands with craters

Scorched earth and barren fields

Places with your father's bones

Where death followed them underground

Where secret wars were raged by secret men

Paranoid men

They were not crooks

They made those boys into men

We smashed our bottles and performed

Our dance

Other subs have threads with hundreds of comments. I want to read a hundred poems today.

EDIT: So you know that dinner we talked about? It's going to be happening now. I will return about 9PM CDT (or an hour and a half for those without clocks). I want to encourage everyone who submitted a poem to read at least one other in this thread and give a little feedback or ask a question. Y'all have been wonderful so far.

ONE FINAL EDIT FOR TONIGHT: When I started this I was a little worried that I was going to be reading dull poetry all night. You guys proved me very wrong. There are a lot of talented poets around here. So here's the deal. I'm going to be doing this once a week every week for the foreseeable future.

I'm United Statesian (WE HAVE A LAME COUNTRY NAME) currently living in Louisiana. It's my family's home state but I grew up elsewhere. I moved here a few years ago to forge a stronger connection with relatives who live here.

Healer, repairman, or just generally compassionate person, I want to help others and the people on this sub are some of the others I'd like to help. We are a community and I intend to take that seriously. I'm off for drinks with some friends now. Good night and good writing!

With bolt cutters

Once for the wrong names they’d been given.

With each foot-pound applied.

Eeping

The devil I thought I left behind


It crawls around throughout the night

Looking for the only light

The light to bleed it out

See and just to figure out


Why this devil is within

And why dear God


A sin to sit and wait and

Think of things that make 

most people shrink

Shrink behind their wooden desk

In fear of looking at the breast

And skin

From within

It is a mortal thing that corrupts

All this life begins with lust

A lust of life and fruit so red

That it comes with what is said

From the man behind the stand

But I know his mask is thin

And I see the sins he holds

Hiding in his own skin folds

Oh his sins and how they seep

But he brings the folks to weep

But he won’t know what’s in store

For him behind the Golden door.

The pearly gates to judge

With the man from up above

But the mind can’t take these things

So I bid adieu and take my leap.

We have lain on sodden banks
Glaring
Looming
Clouds part freeing rays from God
A warmth surpasses the cool of our skin.
Yet we have lain on sodden banks
Dank the grass


Threadbare as we watch. Our minds puddled.
The tailor weaves his magic
Like the sly Wizard he seems
A swatch of stolen fabrics.
""We reap what we sow""
Stolen by no man but ones full of anguish
When only we had dipped our toes in.


Frozen
Frozen.
The window
Your porcelain face seemingly perfect amongst the cracks.
Mine
My reflection? Like an entombed doll from Russia.
Tiny. Nearly forgotten
Lies the figure who'll fight to push her.


Freed from within
Like unspoken caws from the Crow
Dark
Loosely perched
Imprints nearing full
Knowledgable
A black feather nestles gently on the bank.
Dank the grass


Salutations for the Wizard and his mysterious bird.
Cut into halves
Like a quilt once yanked from the beds forbidden side
Seemingly fit for only but one
Instead like a silk pair of gloves
A truer reality to come


Tis fit for the hands of a Murder.

has four letters

I'll take it off your back  
if you're willing.

and my wings are spread wide  
there's space between them.

    how to use a telephone.

She's dangerous

Fear when you were young    
It was the monster in the dark    
The spider on the porch    
The bees nest in your yard    
The thought of being left alone in a crowded room    
The guilt of misbehaving    
Your parents judgement too

With age comes understanding    
It dissolves these fears    
But it breeds contempt and friction    
With every passing year

Now we fear ideas and concepts

A child you cannot raise    
The thought that your life is insignificant    
Nothing special though to say

It has been lived before and it will be lived again. ",,t5_2qhhu,1349909136.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/119kce/on_fear/

pressed against your head with your own finger on the trigger.  Thinking to   

myself that maybe putting this hole in my head will help stop the vacuum from  

crushing my sanity like a depressurized capsule lost in the infinity of space and  

time.  There’s a reason at age 5 that I could hold a conversation with a stuffed  

lion

Capri-Sun. My mind drew an innocent face carrying cordial words to offer to   

increasingly concerned inquisition.  That bastard went back to work gripping and  

ripping the cords of me until it created a powerless emotional vegetable that   

struggled with even the simplest of human tasks.  I could tell you the feeling of  

apathetically walking through the days that are meant to define a person

I don’t want to be checked into an asylum.  I’m great at offering the correct   

answers

my thoughts and confusion marks my existence.  Throw a few connected words   

in a row and I’ll find a way to rot their core and grow a dead bush in their stead.  

Self-pity is just a sad excuse for narcissism and this can never lead to self-  

actualization or awareness because the closer I step to achieving progress in  

grasping what it means to exist, the farther I come from relative  

sanity and the comfort therein.  I wish I could just rip off my face and let myself  

out of this world and enter another existence.  I was born one way and I’ll die another

but in the meantime I’m left to discover what is happening in the meantime.  Why do  

I perceive frequencies of sound as the answer to my questions when really the  

frequencies of a person’s voice is really just a product the liar’s existence that  

occurred and is occurring in the milliseconds before I heard and comprehended  

the sounds that were belched in my direction by another lost entity.  Anxiety  

can’t encapsulate my emotions because it’s a word and emotions are more than  

words.  The meaning of a word always encapsulates more truth than its descriptive  

power.  That’s what breeds the dissatisfaction of verbal and written explanations  

of spiritual explorations.  I’ll travel infinitely into myself and return with the entire  

Truth at my soul’s fingertips unable to spit it out because words and words can’t  

express anything beyond words.  The profoundness of a proverb sits beneath the  

proverb and the power of a word could crush the combined expression of written  

work.  There is no depth to anything outside the oceans and lakes because that  

word is so tethered to our cognition.  We are so shitty at understanding anything  

that we have created words and languages to explain everything.  That’s why  

Descartes was wrong

wrong

Thinking yourself into another reality is frowned upon

I supposed to do here besides pretend that I love the chocolate I eat and the  

air I can’t taste?

To put like words in combination
To put them all now in relation
This little thing of my creation.    


So I've succumbed to fascination
My pen proceeds to battle station
My mind should act with inspiration
To this semantic application.


On page it now has preservation
Inside it gains appreciation
When fears receive exoneration
When thoughts in words provide elation.  


This may put you into sedation
You may not feel the same sensation
But this is my infatuation
With words in certain presentation.  


They have no real implication
And thus they hold no expectation
But they lead one into contemplation
A poem of sorts


Small verses with no elongation
Can lead to quiet desperation
But fear ye not the limitation
Of this


I write to relay information
Without any consideration
To a critic's choice of condemnation
Of a poem that's built on no foundation.  


Some say
""This work needs expert reparation"".  
But give it not your restoration.  
For rhyme is poets’ respiration.  


It merely is an explanation
To ease poetic trepidation
But lead you not into temptation
To find some phoney imitation.  


Enjoy this drawn out innovation
A simple
And treat it not with indignation
For lacking perfect punctuation.  


This leaves me near the culmination
A stream of thought
Like stars within a constellation
United whilst in segregation.

While not without exasperation
Has helped me in my navigation

Nails dig into the skin.   
Inside the mind a somber voice rasps  
Not to move an inch. 


Hands are shaking  
Palms are wet  
Skin grows damp  
With beads of sweat. 

Everyone is afraid of something  
No one had nothing to fear.  
Standing,  
Terrified of what you might hear.   

A child fears the things that come out  
When the sun has gone to bed.   
She lays awake for hours
Monsters running through her head.   

A parent fears for their little girl
Knowing that one day    
The monsters all will leave her head    
And worse things will move in to stay.

second shelf,

that book: *Like the Fallen Leaves* 

remember it?

the one we had to read Sophomore year?

you remember

it was the one with the red cover with the gold inlay.

I was so happy when you said you would be my partner

though I made sure not to show it

 I remember us in the library during lunch

you were wearing that sundress and you still had that short hair

the book was old so it drew my attention

we read a bit of it and you said it was okay

do you remember how we would sit so close?

In class

We were so close

though I pretended to be distant

do you remember how we would take so long at the library?

How I would stall with tangents?

Just so we could spend more time

together

I remember how you weren't going to be in class the next day

you said you had a doctors appointment

do you remember that?

I remember how because I had one the next day I left you a note

saying how we should get some ice cream after school the next day

to celebrate the end of the analyzing

remember how I slipped it in the book?

Page 86

I remember how exited I was that you wrote yes

in those little loops that are your 'O's

do you remember driving home that day?

Do you remember the intersection?

Do you remember the red light?

Do you remember you not seeing it?

Do you remember the semi-truck?

Do you remember impact?

I remember when I heard the next day

I remember not hearing the words at all

having Jane tell me again

tell me that you were dead

I remember that I broke down

I remember the looks from those around me

I remember when it came out

that I liked you

I remember not being in school for a while

afterwords

I remember that when I got back the book was back on the shelf

I remember taking it with trembling hands

and teary eyes

I remember flipping through the old pages

I still remember the smell

I always will

I remember finding the note

still inside

I remember that I would come back to it

to the book

 every now and again

just to see the note

I remember it not being there one day

I remember asking the librarian

I remember her saying that she had thrown it away

I remembered that I never removed the note

it seemed wrong to do so

so here I am now

senior year is ending soon

and I have one more final before I'm done

I bought a new copy of that book

I donated it to the library

I came back the next day

and it was where the old one was

I'm placing this letter inside

on page 86

this shelf will always be a memorial

at least to me

I promise that

that I will come back

and I will stand:

here

and I will read this note

and talk to you again

but now I have to go take my last final

my poetry final.

I love you.
