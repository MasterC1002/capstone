1360192621.0,1812dt,"After playing guitar for more than 20 years, here are some things I've learned.",jecahn,1204,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1812dt/after_playing_guitar_for_more_than_20_years_here/

1. Are you ""practicing"" or ""just playing?"" There's a difference. Practice something new until you get it down. Otherwise you just go back to the playing the same things

2. Don't rehearse, it's hard to find a show at all. That said, there are few ways to get better faster than to play in front of people. Do it. The more intimidating the crowd, the more valuable to your playing it will be.

3. Along the same lines, now.) This guy could tear it up, legitimately. He was just effortless. He was the one who told me to always play with guys way better than you because it will make you push yourself and as long as they see that you're trying to keep up, they'll never make you feel foolish. They'll respect you and grab your wrist when you need a hand out of the hole you dug. He was right.

4. You don't need that amp, digital thing. I've owned everything. I own a ridiculous amount of equipment, currently. In the band I gig most often with, you know what I play? A Squier Classic Vibe Tele and a 15 watt Excelsior amp. The Marshall and the other Marshall and the SuperSonic and the Deluxe Reverb stay in the basement. I'm too old to be humping 4X12's and heads and 60 pound combos up and down stairs in NYC. I don't need to be anywhere near as loud as I think I do and any place that is too big for my 15 watt to carry is going to have a soundguy who will want to mic my amp and in that case it doesn't matter how many or few watts I have. The '62 CS Strat and the Custom Heritage Les Paul and the Ibanez Prestige were damn expensive and I want to have a few cocktails and bullshit with my band after I'm done playing, not worry about keeping an eye on my gear. The point is this: gear has come A LONG way. Even in the past 5 years. When I started playing the stuff that people said was crap was legitimately, unplayable crap and actually, even the ""good stuff"" wasn't all that great. (late 70's Strats and Les Pauls? Firewood!) That's not the case these days. Even the cheap stuff is solid. New gear is not going to be the secret key that unlocks the tone in your head. Trust me on this. If you suck on cheap gear, you'll just be broke and suck. Get good at using the stuff you've got. You know how you've read that your tone is in your fingers? It's true. Practice with what you've got. You don't need new gear. Save your money or spend it on lessons.

5. Now that you're being superselective about what you buy, original Hamer archtops, Strats that weren't that old when I got and parted with them but are now considered ""vintage"" and thus would cost much more than I'd be willing to spend on them to get them back. The list goes on. Don't get rid of stuff. At the least, you'll eventually be sorry. At the most, it will suddenly turn into ""vintage gear"" and become desirable so that even if you want it for playing purposes, the collectors market will dictate the price. That Line 6 amp? The one that I told you was garbage in another thread? There's nothing wrong with it. It's a good amp. Keep it, use it. If you get rid of it, now

6. Stop reading shit on the internet. The boards on the internet are hilarious to me. Everyone is either constantly complaining or giving out unsolicited advice as some sort of expert. The Tweed Deluxe is NOT the best amp you'll ever play out of. 7.25 radius necks DON'T fret out if they're set up competently. That guy who claims to own three original '59 bursts, either to himself or to you and probably both. You know all the crap you read. Take it with a grain of salt. If these guys spend as much time playing as monkeying around on the internet, talking about gear, they'd know that a lot of what they all agree and disagree on is nonsense. All you need to be an internet guitar expert these days is a WiFi connection and a credit card. Don't believe me? Go on YouTube and type in ""gear-that-I'm-about-to-buy review."" On ALL of fucking youtube, there are about 4 guys demoing gear who can actually play. They even say in the description, ""Ignore the playing, I know I suck, you'll suck equally on good or bad equipment.

7. Get a good tech guy. A guy who really knows his stuff. Like, doesn't talk to you and immediately starts telling you how low he can get your action, run screaming and find a new guy. Have your guitars setup and gone over at least once a year. Seasons change and these things are made mostly of wood. They're gonna move around. Having your guitar feel great is going to make you confident and when you're confident and the guitar feels great, you're going to play great and sound great.

8. Another thing that I'll add, LTD's or Indonesian Jacksons. If you like that, make it yours. I don't know if you've looked at the Ibanez website lately but there are an awful lot of dayglo guitars that people swore up and down were ugly just 10 years ago. That said, if you want a CS Strat, get one. There is a difference and it's worth paying for. Just don't let anyone tell you that your gear is either too much or too little for you.

I'm sure there are more that I can add but this is all that comes to mind and I""m sure that this is too long as it is.

1358226958.0,16loes,Fundamentals of Music Theory,RayoBlanco,1263,263,144,"The following lessons are a combination of some of my old reddit comments that I've edited to for better clarity

**1: Diatonicism** 

There are only 12 unique pitches. After that there are only octaves. The pitches are A, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, G, or in other words

The diatonic scale is the basis of all western music. Diatonicism is simply a specific spread of 7 notes. The spread of the 7 notes corresponds to the natural lettered notes (no sharps), because there are 7 notes in the diatonic scale, there are 7 modes. 

Look at a piano. If you only play the white notes, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Depending on which note you choose as your tonic (home note), if you choose A as your tonic you're in the Aeolian or minor mode

The seven modes of the diatonic scale comprised of the white keys of the piano:

A as tonic: A Aeolian (also called A minor)

B as tonic: B Locrian

C as tonic: C Ionian (also call C major)

D as tonic: D Dorian

E as tonic: E Phrygian

F as tonic: F Lydian

G as tonic: G Mixolydian

Note that Aeolian and Ionian are also called the minor and major mode respectively. These modes get an extra name because about 99% of western music is in one of these two modes. They are heavily favoured. 

This is only 1 of the 12 diatonic keys though. To go through each key, but guitar is, so it's tab time!

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|----------------------------5--7-------

    A|----------------5--7--8----------------

    E|-----5--7--8---------------------------

You can see above I just played the notes A, D, E, F, G, and finally A an octave higher. This is the same as the white notes on piano. If we choose the first note as the tonic we are in the minor mode, and since the first note is A we're in A minor. Choosing the second note as our tonic would put us in B Locrian mode, fourth note: D Dorian

You should realize that no matter which mode you are playing in above you are playing the exact same 7 notes. The only difference is which note you choose as your home base (tonic).  This is why A minor is called the relative minor of C major and C major the relative major of A minor. Because the two modes are the same notes. 

Above we tabbed the diatonic key of A minor / C major.  (the diatonic key is defined either by it's minor or major mode. Hence you see the key of A minor, even though all three modes I just listed are the same notes. Essentially, music in modes other than the major or minor, historically was never really written, so now the keys are limited to a major or minor definition. I suppose there's nothing stopping you from scoring a piece in any mode, F# Locrian for example)

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|----------------------------6--8-------

    A|----------------6--8--9----------------

    E|-----6--8--9---------------------------


Above is A# minor/ C# major. All we did was transpose every note up one semitone. The pattern

A# Aeolian or A# minor 

C Locrian (because B# is C)

C# Ionian or C# major

D# Dorian

F Phrygian (because E# is F)

F# Lydian

G# Mixolydian

Now we've tabbed 2 of the 12 diatonic keys.

Continuing to transpose up a semitone we get the diatonic key of B minor/D major:


    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|----------------------------7--9-------

    A|----------------7--9--10---------------

    E|-----7--9--10--------------------------

The modes of the above key are:

B Aeolian or B minor 

C# Locrian 

D Ionian or D major

E Dorian

F# Phrygian 

G Lydian

A Mixolydian

That's 3 of the 12 diatonic keys. We can continue this pattern to get all 12 diatonic keys

So that's about all there is to it. but let's continue with a practical example to make sure you understand.


Say someone says ""I'm playing in F# Dorian bro!"". 

Okay. Here's D Dorian as we saw before

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|-------------------------5--7----------

    A|--------------[5]--7--8----------------

    E|-----5--7--8---------------------------

So we need that D (bracketed note) to be an F#. F# is 4 semitones higher than D

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|-----------------------------9--11-----

    A|----------------[9]--11--12------------

    E|-----9--11--12-------------------------
 
Now the bold note

C# minor (the first note

D# Locrian

E Major  (12 on the E sting is an E)

G# Phrygian (11 on the A string is a G#)

A Lydian ( 12 on the A string is an A) 

B mixolydian (9 on the D string is a B)

He plays in a band called ""Brown Note"", for a friday show, my uncle returned to his house to find it gone. all of it. 70k worth of speakers, boards, guitars, and all sorts of home made shit he'd made over the years. Luckily it was insured, but insurance can only do so much. 

The biggest casualty was my uncle's favorite guitar. His Charvel. here's a pic of [""The Goat""](http://i.imgur.com/wfYUpha.jpg).

Its a Charvel San Dimas Style 2. and is out of production. My late Grandpa helped him pick it out

So my request is this, but that guitar was an extension of him. It would mean the world to my family to have it back. Thanks for your time everyone.

Let's have a weekly theme! I say we dedicate one or two days a week to a certain topic. I'd like the one or two days to fall on the weekend. That way you won't be interrupted by work or school while you're exploring all the cool new content. On those days

Example; If the topic is ""Beginner Week, differences in guitar materials, links to a new player's first cover, song suggestions, etc. 

See where I'm going with this? I'd like to have the themes planned out well in advance so that you can prepare your material during the week. This is just an idea. It might also make sense to have the theme ongoing throughout the week. 

Posts could also have new tags such as [TIP], and so forth. Ultimately, if we follow through with this, I'd like it to have its own place in the sidebar. 

Here are some themes we could have:

* Beginner Week
* Advanced Week
* Acoustic Week
* Electric Week
* Rock Week (Can have a week for each style-- Jazz
* Effect Week
* Accessory Week
* Theory Week
* Band Week (Share clips of your band

So tell me; What do you think? Please leave any and all suggestions/comments you might have.

I flew from Boston to LAX where a transportation service picked up all the contest winners, there was a display of a woman in a dress and high heels tearing down drywall.  It was a Tuesday night yet the hotel was bustling with people dressed in the finest/sluttiest attire, and I felt like I was in an episode of Entourage.  My hotel room featured a bright orange bathroom and a thermostat that simply read “blow; hard, harder, stop.”  I headed back downstairs and sat down in the hotel’s swanky restaurant to have dinner with the other contest winners.  There was a door in the back of the restaurant that led to a mysterious room lit only by strobe lights.  As we ate our dinners, people would stumble in and out of the strobe room adjusting bra straps and skirts.   It was surreal to be in such a crazy place under equally crazy circumstances.  I felt at home however, when I got to know the other guitarists.   These guys were so nice and supportive and it reminded me of hanging out at Berklee.  

The next morning, so I  took the opportunity to meet up with one of my mentors and dear friends Josh Brill.  Josh taught me at the Berklee summer programs when I was in high school and has really helped me develop as a musician and as a person.  Josh has an incredible gift for getting people to see things from a positive perspective, and talking to him all morning really helped settle my nerves.  Naturally, I really hoped Steve Vai would like me and I had prepared a press kit to share my music with him.  I was fairly anxious about meeting him because I didn’t want to miss my chance to become friends with my idol.  Josh helped me see that whether Vai and I became pals or not, I had already won by being invited there in the first place and that I should savor the moment for what happens rather than what could happen.  He helped me realize that if I enter the clinic from a positive position of gratitude rather than expectation, I would enjoy the clinic more and have a more meaningful experience.  I decided that I would focus on what Steve already gave me by flying me up to meet him, rather than on what could happen.  I still planned on giving Steve my music, I was definitely on a good course.

That night at the clinic the other guitarists and I sat in the show room of a huge Guitar Center and eagerly awaited Steve’s arrival.  Each contest winner received a free guitar and wah-pedal, there he is!” kind of feeling.  He walked on the stage, looked around at everyone, turned to me and said, “Hey, I’ve met you before!”  In a roar of excitement I replied “Yeah four times!” (Which is true.)  He said, “Man you could be my brother-in-law or something, “Well

Steve immediately opened the floor for questions and not too many people were raising their hands.  Since I had A LOT of questions

Here are my two most important questions and Steve’s answers as I understood them:

Q:  I write more material than I can afford to record.  My goal is to be able to record my music whenever I want, promotion, and tours of my next albums.  Do you have any advice for me?  

A:  Steve said that there is absolutely no reason why I can’t do that, and sound, I can properly take the steps to reach my idea of success.  

Secondly, but ultimately, successfully climbing one of the steps requires me to find joy in the process of climbing in the first place.  In other words, the way to move closer to achieving my goals, is to focus on the things that I love about the process. Steve said that you can only truly succeed at something that you love doing.  To me that means if you have to get a day job, you should view your job as something that further enables your passion.  Your job is something that enables you to move forward on your journey.  Having this positive perspective allows you to maintain focus on everything you love about the process, so that you will be better at it.  Clearly people do a better job when they love what they’re doing.  Also, you feel really great and accomplished

Finally, you’ll fail.  If you think you’ll succeed, you’ll succeed.  No matter what, you’re right.”

Basically, and NEVER allowing yourself to doubt whether or not the goal can be achieved.  The love has a spiraling effect to it, where the more you love about what you do, the more you love what you do.

Q:  I am about to graduate from Berklee

A:  There is nothing you can do to prepare for it.  It is chaos.  However, you become that doubt.  The game is 99% mental.

I had a very positive attitude going into the clinic thanks to my morning with Josh, when it came time to give Steve my press kit.  I simply told him what it was, and that if he wants to check out the music it’s there for him.  I let him have my work that I poured my heart into, but didn’t pressure him to keep it.  I didn’t have to, because I know that no matter what happens, I will succeed.

1334868223.0,siesy,"A guide to the differences between Distortion, Overdrive, and Fuzz pedals",MistaPitts,735,107, and fuzz pedals. So here goes:

**Distortion** pedals are probably the most common kind of stompbox out there, and tend not to add *too* much volume to your signal. Used in conjunction with a tube amp set to break up a bit or an overdrive pedal they can help produce that Van Halen ""brown sound"".

**Tech Talk:** Distortion pedals produce ""hard clipping"" by shorting the peaks of your signal's waveform to ground using diodes placed *after* the op-amp in the pedal. Hard clipping produces odd-order harmonics (think ""gritty"")

**Examples:** Boss DS-1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**Overdrive** pedals are a little more subtle. They produce a smoother

**Tech Talk:** Overdrive pedals produce ""soft clipping"" by placing diodes in the feedback loop of the pedal's op-amp. Soft clipping produces more even-order harmonics (think ""smooth""). This type of clipping tends not to compress the volume too much

**Examples:** Ibanez Tube Screamer, and Blues Driver

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**Fuzz** pedals are a little different. They produce a metallic, the Black Keys, and Neutral Milk Hotel's bassist. The tone of these pedals varies widely between each brand. Which leads me into:

**Tech Talk:** Fuzz pedals produce a square wave, others send the signal through several stages of diode clipping until a square wave is produced.

**Examples:** Big Muff Pi

Please let me know if I missed anything or made any mistakes!

EDIT: **Boost** pedals are basically just an op-amp or other kind of amplification circuit that adds volume to your signal without distorting it. The Robert Keeley Katana comes to mind,False,,t5_2qi79,True,,,t3_siesy
1367286885.0,1dds0t,"Reddit, you saved me from a fake guitar",Da_Choppah,730,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1dds0t/reddit_you_saved_me_from_a_fake_guitar/

So after getting it home

Some of the user's comments alluded to confusion over what model it was. I'm aware of the rash of fake Gibsons out there but I've never come across a fake Fender

I thought about taking the advice of some posters and began looking at dark colored pick guards on 3 tone sunburst strats and I kept noticing that no other American strat I looked at had 2 strings trees like mine. At least not that I could find with a Google search. Ok

I started doing checks that I found on the internet. Wood insert at truss hole? Yes....seems unusually dark, no dots. Still good. Serial # check (why didn't I do this first?)........so it seems this guitar was made in 2007. Well that's quite odd. The guitar is mint. I'm not an expert so perhaps it's not completely out of the ordinary for a 6 year old guitar to be sold new.....but damn it seems odd. 

So that ate at me all morning until I couldn't take it anymore. I had enough and grabbed the guitar and drove to the store when I got off work

Here's how it went down.

When I walked in

Owner: ""How can I help you?""

Me: ""I bought this guitar here and I'm kind of concerned with it because I can't find any model that matched this 100% exactly by searching the web.""

Owner looks at it. ""You didn't buy that here. It's not a Fender. It's probably the best fake I've ever seen

Me: ""You bet your ass I bought it here. Here's the receipt.""


The owner tried to play this ""you must've bought a real one from us and now you're trying to return a fake one for a refund move"" and I was seeing red. I told him something along the lines of ""I'll be calling the credit card company to cancel the charge, and this is what I get?""

Long story short

The son allegedly put it on the wall ""as a joke"" with Fender tags on it

Once it got to that point, legal action, etc. We reached an agreement that he would refund my money (minus the pickups I bought with the guitar) and let me keep the guitar as well as throw in a Digitech RP255. And I signed a form that his lawyer faxed over agreeing that I would not seek legal action. So I may not own the ""Fender"" I've been wanting, but I own a free fakie and got a new effects toy to play with. So I guess it's a happy ending.

I wanted to send a big THANK YOU to all those that commented on my previous thread. Without them


tl/dr: Bought USA strat from store, got guitar for free along with effects pedal in exchange for not suing.

The main things the guy stressed were:

* **Tone** - He spend the first half an hour or so talking only about tone
Some of the points he made &amp; that I wrote down are:

    * try picking at different points along the string; picking at the bridge sounds different than picking over the neck. 
    * Picking exactly 12 frets above the fretted note provides a 'clarinet'-esque sound.
    * Different sides of the pick produce different sounds
    * Volume knob is the most important part of the guitar in changing tone
        * Full volume = Beefy gain sound
        * Midway = still distorted but much thinner sound.
        * Low = can turn it so low that the sound is basically clean but allows you to dig in without being too loud or overpowering. Perfect for funk sounds.
    * Also the vibrato you use can drastically affect the sound of a lick

* **Playing by ear**  - Obviously he started playing guitar in an era where there was no internet tabs or guitar pro

* **Technique** - he actually discussed this less than you would have expected from a GG masterclass

    * He attributes his picking hand technique not to insane metronome workouts like John Petrucci, but experiment with your picking hand position if you're having trouble.

    * He said that he used to alternate pick exclusively until he started to study bebop. Bebop uses more arpeggio-based licks than scale-based

    * He also said that picking hand technique will always fail if the fretting hand technique is not up to scratch

Some other random points:

* He advised practicing with a loop pedal / backing tracks over practicing to a metronome

* He mentioned that he sings along with what he plays in his head

* Someone asked about how to get away from playing all the same shapes &amp; box patterns &amp; Guthrie suggested trying to solo on only one string. Doing this forces you to develop your musicality as it means that you can't use all the blues licks &amp; shred runs you have

He talked about loads of other stuff such as playing with Dizzee Rascal &amp; how he wrote Fives (he was sat in a park and heard a bird singing in 5/4). Most of all

Stage amp: Black Star HT-5 

Guitar: MIM Strat with ""Eveything Axe"" pups and recently professionally set up with 11-45's. A pretty sweet combination - when played through the right amp.

Predetermined Requested Playlist: (included) ""Bad Moon Rising"" 

Preparation: To match the original recording, after practicing it at home (and nailing it lick for lick), I decided to leave the guitar in that tuning to play Bad Moon Rising as the first song, then tune back up to standard tuning for the remainder of the tunes. edit: I informed the bass player and first guitar of my different tuning on the first song.

The situation: One of the stage amps is an adequate Peavey (not sure of the model) and a ... Blackstar HT-5 (*cringe*).  IMHO,  I brought along my Ibanez TS-808 to help drive it a little (wrong thinking).

On stage: I suit up and strum my E form against the other guitarist's standard tuned D. Sounds fine. Not perfect

I could faintly hear my guitar (volume knob now maxed out) so I find the right time (well, ""Oh lord. Help me through this one and I promise I'll never get back on stage again. What was I thinking. I'm not good (loud) like these guys.""

We're two measures away from my my unsolicited ad lib lead before the house guitarist looks at me to ""Take it away, ""You gotta!"". 

Fuck. I whale away but can't hear anything over the bass, a slide guitarist who decided to invite himself, and myself crying. 

They eventually lower their volumes so they can hear little ol' me beating the fuck outta my strings. So obviously, lord.""

During my crucifixion

Oh

Thankfully

For the remainder of the song

Okay

I opted for the last resort - tuning out loud to the lead guitarist - something I simply can. not. stand. to hear when I'm listening to live music.

I get the initial E and tune everything accordingly then strum an E chord against his. Not even close. Is it me? Is it him? Is it both of us? Should I fake an injury and limp off the stage?

I decided to thank the guys and get off stage and let the show go on without me.

""More! More! More!"" Satan's crowd yelled. I think they meant, more than ""We all really liked that. Please entertain us with a similar tune"". 

As I was hunting for the what now appeared to be 6"" wide steps off stage

All the jammers get free beer if they play - at least two songs. I had only one beer before playing. ""I'll pay double for that beer"", much better than me) play there and is a good music appreciator and promoter of talent, so I felt obligated.

I won't go into how horrible the next two songs were (I'll just mention that due to my hay-wired nerves

I couldn't wait to get off that stage.

I also won't mention that the owner borrowed my guitar for the next song and eventually quit playing it because he was having to chase the tuning. I gave him fair warning of the problem. He just didn't realize the severity of it.


In hindsight, ""there are going to be nights like that"". But I *am* thinking of taking two weeks off then quitting.

(And after you've basked in the cheers of the audience.) Look for the dude/dudette running sound. Point to the cable in the output jack of your guitar and yell/say ""AM I GOOD TO GO?!"" Then wait for them to give a thumbs up or something. Give them some time to mute your channel before you unplug.

If you prematurely un-jack-ulate your guitar through the sound system you will most certainly get annoyed ""aawwss"" from the crowd. It could damage their equipment. You'll get embarrassed. The sound guy will hate you. And that one girl will crumple up the napkin with her phone number on it because she would never bed someone so unprofessional.

Seriously though, crowd doesn't have to deal with that annoying as fuck ""chu-gunk"" sound. 


**TL:DR -** Make sure you're channel is muted before you unplug you're guitar from the PA.

1345926986.0,ytkh4,Dear guitarists: How to sound good playing live.,Peteriffic,554,82,259,"Hi r/guitar. Some recent discussions here and there have prompted me to make this post about live sound and playing live. I play guitar, I have a few tips/suggestions for all of you playing live on how to sound good because guitarists are among the most unruly people to mix for. 


1. The soundguy is your friend, when soundguys are asking you to do something, its not because they don't like your tone or are hating on you, its because they need to make everything sound good to the audience. Soundguys are uniquely positioned in this role, and often know the room or venue loads better than you do. They are trying to prevent you from sounding like crap.

2. Turn down. Amp volume is the #1 issue. The only time that your amp volume isn't an issue is when you're playing large large venues that are outdoors, but really, so few peope actually hear your perfect tone, or even notice a difference. Most of the time, your tone is going through your guitar cable, probably 20-30' of wires in your PB, into another cable, into a 57, into a power amp, you've just destroyed the rest of the band's sound. Honestly. 

3. You don't need anything above maybe 30w to play live. Its possible to play a 30k stadium gig with a blues junior. The lower your wattage, they weigh less, and use less tubes (saves $$). Sure, keep your higher wattages around for gigs where you might need to have a little volume, but these are few and far between for the average band. 30w is a lot, you probably won't get passed 3 on the volume knob, and even less for higher wattages.

4. The tone you get in your bedroom is different from the tone you track an album with is different from the tone you play live with. In live sound there are a ton of variables to consider that you don't have to worry about on an album, etc. Sound is a living breathing thing (to borrow an expression), and live there is so much more that goes into making your band sound great. Most of the adjustments, if not all, can be done by the soundguy and the parametric or compressors. However, there are occasions where he might ask you to change your tone a bit, or adjust volume, awesome. However, to give some room to the bass and the drums. Likewise, and I have to make sure you sound good at the same time. There is a lot more thought that goes into a live mix than what you do at rehearsal


5. Please be on time to soundcheck. This is pretty simple, do that too. All of these things are so that we can make YOU sound good. It makes no sense to me when bands disregard line checks. Again, I'm not just some nerd behind a bunch of switches happy I get to order around a band. I am literally the only one who can tell you what you sound like with ears that know what they're hearing. Please remember that!

6. On the flip side, and have a lot on the plate. Just give us some room to work. Don't be a dick (something that applies to everyone in every job).

1. Spend 8 hours a day surfing the web reading gear reviews trying to ""find your sound."" Trying to ""find your sound"" can be exhausting
2. Never tune your guitar. Tuning is for losers.
3. Make sure you never
4. Instead of spending time studying actual music
5. Remember that there's no such thing as too much gain.
6. Find only fault in the playing of others... especially critically acclaimed
7. Avoid playing with musicians who are better than you are at all costs.
8. If you are forced to play with highly skilled musicians
9. Adjust your strap so your guitar hangs down around your ankles
10. Only play and listen to one genre of music. Insist for the rest of your life that everything else sucks.
11. Convince yourself that you don't sound good because of some piece of gear that you can't afford, would instantly transform you into Steve Vai.
12. Practice in front of a mirror, pouting and posing.
13. Only play solos. Losers play rhythm guitar.
14. Practice the exact same way every day. Never change your approach to anything even if you spend hours a day with the guitar and never seem to get any better.
15. Have no patience with yourself whatsoever. If you try to learn a new skill and are not instantly successful
16. Believe that you are entitled to greatness.
17. Assign responsibility for your progress to your teacher. If you're not getting any better
18. Only learn Yngwie licks (badly). Everything else is just garbage that's too easy.
19. Only learn Nirvana songs. Everything else is just garbage that has no substance.
20. If you're having trouble learning a new lick or riff
21. Convince yourself that great players became great on talent alone... and if you just don't have it
22. Consume as much instructional material as you possibly can (video, ever attempt any of the examples.
23. Don't bend to pitch. It takes too much effort to learn and it's really not a big deal anyway.
24. Refine and perfect the most asymmetrical
25. Quit.

I started playing when I was around 16, Pantera) whilst paying no attention to technique and music theory. I'm sure there are many of you who've had a crack at that Battery/Master of Puppets solo only to be left frustrated and disappointed, mostly because your hands simply aren't adept enough regardless of how many times you practise.

Dejected

5 years later (a few months ago) I pulled my old electric guitar out from my parents garage, where do I even begin...??  So many articles, books, tutorials, resources. All I knew was that if I was ever going to seamlessly rip out a beautiful blues solo that raises the hairs on your neck, I wasn't going to do without some self discipline.

Why am I telling you all this?  Well, and not knowing where to even start to 'break out'.  As such I'm writing my thoughts and recent revelation to encourage those who have reached a hurdle, a wall, a stumbling block, to PUT DOWN the guitar tabs, to stop just playing along to your favourite songs mindlessly, and follow these 2 very simple steps. 

**Technique**: Spend whatever you can spare per day doing careful, do the exercises to the beat of a background song or a ticking of a clock.  Focus on every note sounding just right with no overlap, buzz or mess.  Start slowly, be mindful, really focus and teach your fingers.

**Theory**: If nothing else, you will very quickly be able to easily jam/improvise over the top of your favourite tracks.

After only a month or two of doing just these 2 things above, sweet riffs and solos over the top of BB King's 'Greatest Hits', it felt awesome...  A reward for being disciplined with my learning.

Good luck guys

Just a little sidenote: These observations may seem obvious to those who are fluent in both technique and theory

I'm currently looking to buy a Les Paul of the Epiphone brand

* The first Les Paul I looked at is the Epiphone Les Paul Custom Prophecy Plus EX. It seems to be quite good value, slimmer neck, and active EMG's (81/85). Now I know that active EMG's probably won't get me the tone I'm looking for, but they can be close.

* Other than that

* I know the amp is a big factor in tone as well

We've been forming a relationship with a local bar over the last 2 years or so, asking if we could fill a closing slot tonight for a blues/classic rock cover band. We said yes, absolutely. 

Turns out our drummer's had a trip to Las Vegas planned for some time, and do a set of covers with a few originals mixed in. Acoustic guitar, bass, kick drum, both vocalists. It goes over very well, we always get drunks shouting oddball requests at us and we consider it a point of pride to make it happen. (For example, tonight in the same ten-minute span we had requests for Justin Bieber and Black Sabbath. Played 'em both, we are aware that our job is to make the crowd happy and keep them drinking

The problem, took 30 minutes to break down, and then they all split. I mean, they were gone before we played a note. And, because of the delay, so was their crowd. We were there for their set, applauding, supporting them, when we were *bailing them out*—they couldn't be bothered to stick around for even 15 minutes on a Saturday night. They didn't even say ""thank you

That band played okay

If you have a band playing behind you

1. **Get your shit off the stage in a timely manner**—While you're setting up and playing

2. **Support the other bands**—You don't have to stay for their whole set, and support the bar while they're going on. Give them a shout out from the stage. You are not above them—they're on the same shitty bill as you. They are your co-workers, and the bar is your employer. Forget that at your peril.

TL;DR—Don't be a dick to the other bands you play with.",,t5_2qi79,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1csgdo/if_youre_gigging_please_dont_do_this_rant_incoming/

 [Ukulele chart in it's source format

 *I'm really hoping that I have all of these notes correct. I've checked

 
  I've been playing a LOT of ukulele recently and in an effort to learn my scales on it I created a chart. I decided that I should create a similar one for guitar. I *had* created a chart about a year or so ago

  You might be thinking to yourself ""Why would I memorize all three shapes when I could just memorize the left and the right one?"" Since they have all the notes that are in the middle shape, instead of from left to right, it'd be from right to left. I'm *trying* to keep things simple though so I've decided to leave that one off for now.

  If you've not learned a scale shape before

  **If you're not familiar with scales or how to use them

  The red dots with the big M represents the starting point for playing in the Major scale (if an M dot lands on a G note, this note is often called the blue note. 

  **All of the below applies to the Major/minor scale**
  
  Let's say that you want to play the A major scale using the left shape. To play this, 2nd fret. Coincidentally, this is where you're going to play this shape on the fretboard. If that one note all the way to the left in this shape is on the first fret, then your big M lands on A, and you're playing the A major scale. 
  
  Now that you're playing the A major scale, by The Beatles. If you good off in those scales while listening to these songs, it will sound more or less fine. Slide everything up or down a fret and you'll hear just how bad it can be to play along in the wrong key. In order to play in a different key, just slide your shape around on the fretboard until one of the big M's lands on the major key you want, or one of the little m's for the minor key you want. This will require you to know some notes on the fretboard, otherwise you'll never know what key you're playing in. [Here's a picture of the notes on the fretboard](http://playingelectricguitar.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/guitar-fretboard-notes.jpg) that I pulled up after a few seconds on google. 
  
  If you wanted to you could only learn this shape and noodle around in this position forever but if you want to play A Major further up the neck then you're going to have to play a different shape. Or rather, repeat with shape 3.

So here it goes:

1.) I'm gonna start off by beating a dead horse here. Tone is in your fingers. Jimmy page sounds better on a start knockoff then you do on a prs. Money doesn't make you better at guitar

2.) Play acoustic guitar. I don't care what style or genre you play, and improve. 

3.) Don't rely on pedals to make interesting sounds. This is tied to the last point but is different in some ways. Relying on effects pedals to create interesting music is a really good way to end up repeating yourself. 

4.) It's better to play the wrong note at the right time than the right note at the wrong time. the best jazz players make a career out of playing 'wrong notes' well

5.) Extrapolating on my last point further:  there are no wrong notes. You can play any note over any chord, and are rythmically sound. 

6.) There is nothing you can do to cheat at guitar. If you want to be a good guitar player you have to put the time in

So that's it for now. I will be checking in throughout the day if this thread takes off to answer any questions you might have about the ideas I presented. Hopefully this will lead to good discussion

edit: so it seems like there's a lot of interest on the topic of playing the wrong note at the right time. I'm going to make a little bit of a video lesson when I have some spare time(might ne a couple days) and post it in its own thread. I will also be making a video of some dead covers and posting that as well by request. I will probably make a new thread for that as well as posting a link in the comments. Thanks for all the feedback and interesting counterpoints in the comments

edit: so after reading through the comments you guys made I figured I'd come back and clarify a few things. First I just want to say that everything I wrote is obviously just my opinion

1.) I'm not trying to tell anybody that a nice guitar doesn't sound or play better than a budget guitar. Obviously a finely crafted instrument is going to be superior and that's why many great players have expensive custom guitars. But none of it is necessary to being a great player. The only thing necessary to become a great guitarist is the drive to keep working at it and a functioning guitar.

2.) I'm not saying acoustic is better than electric. And I'm not saying stop playing your electric and play exclusively acoustic. I'm saying if you don't already mix some acoustic guitar playing with your regular playing

3.) Again

4-5.) This statement seemed to me to get the most mixed feedback. Some people totally agree, it comes off as a ""right"" note. If you play that same note overcautiosly and slightly off-beat, it sounds like a gaff or ""wrong"" note. This is all just perception however. Some people think miles davis sounds band, i tend to disagree. I intend to do a little video on monday to discuss this particular topic further. I will post here when that happens.

6.) this seemed to be the only thing that nobody seemed to take issue with. I guess retrospectively it seems self-evident. But at the time it felt right

Thanks again for all the feedback, just one person's experience. ",,False,,t5_2qi79,1364022047.0,,

1370328941.0,1fmzcn,Installed Tronical tuning system... my review,El_Nopal,374,30,80,"I just recently installed the Tronical auto-tuning setup on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard

If you're not familiar with this system

It is basically a robotic tuning system that tunes all 6-string simultaneously and automatically, and 6 user defined tunings.

**Why I purchased the system:**

I chose to install the Tronical system on my Les Paul because my current band requires me to switch between 4 different tunings:  Standard E, and drop-C.  Yes, I know there are many people out there who are like ""screw that, bring 4 guitars"", or ""spend $30 on a tuner and do it manually"".   These aren't really options I consider viable..  (a) I don't want to maintain or carry around 4 guitars, and (b) I don't want to make an audience wait for a couple minutes each time (an eternity in gig time) while I retune several times during a gig.  I wanted a quick, efficient alternative that allowed me to change tunings quickly and accurately.

**Ordering and receiving the tuning system:**

I ordered the system online, so I figured it would be months before I saw it.  I ordered it on May 1st, it shipped from Germany on May 16th, and arrived at my house in Seattle on May 31st.  

**What I received:**

The package includes the circuit board, charger, all mounting hardware, and a basic quick start manual on how to install.   You need to do to their website to download the operating instructions in .PDF format.  My only complaint here is that I wish they had an option for chrome rather than the plastic / bone looking tuners.

**Installation:**

The system bolted on my Epiphone quite easily and required no modifications whatsoever. It fits perfectly and looks like it came factory installed, and 10 being ""engineering degree required"", I'd rate this install a 3.  Super easy, but you need to pay attention at least a little.  My only gripe was that one of the nuts for securing the tuners seemed to be stripped out.  Fortunately they sent extras.  The installed system is light and does not add any noticeable weight to the head stock.  The tuner has 6 lights on in labeled eBGDAE (indicating standard tuning in reverse), and each light has about 10 different colors it can display to denote different functions / meanings when using the tuner.  They are easy to learn.

**Stringing the guitar:**

This was perhaps the most difficult part of the whole process, wrap it around the top, and then secure it with a screw on lock nut.  This is really difficult to do the first try, because you have to hold the string wrapped around the tuning machine while screwing the lock nut on to the top of the peg.  Then you tighten the lock nut with a coin - they advise against using a screwdriver, as it may damage the robotic tuners.  

I found that I had to master holding both the end of the string, or it will unwind as you tighten it and you're back to the drawing board.   Another quirk is that you can only wrap the strings around most of the pegs 2 times at most, so you have to adjust to cutting the strings a little shorter than you might be used to.  I had to redo a couple of the strings when I first started because there was too much loose string to fit on the peg.  Once you have the lock nut tight, you can use the ""string winding"" mode on the tuner to tighten it up to the point you are ready to tune the whole guitar.  I used Dean Markley Classics Lite gauge (.009-.046).  You basically hit the ""up"" and ""down"" buttons on the tuner controls to manually wind the strings up and down.  Pretty cool, like this feature.

**Calibration:** 

It's recommended that you first tune to standard E and run your guitar through calibration mode (which requires the standard E tuning).  This basically sets the gain and interference levels for you.  It involves choosing an option from very simple menus, and strum again when it flashes red again.  It takes about 6-strums to calibrate on average.

**Tuning:** 

This part is really slick.  You basically just select the tuning you want... there's two programmed banks, choose the bank, then choose which tuning in the back you want, and hit the enter button.  The tuners start turning on their own.  You follow the lights on the back (there are 6 basic colors that define what you should do / what is happening).  It takes about 15-30 seconds to tune, depending on your accuracy setting.  I found that the lower accuracy settings were not good for tunings below standard E-flat, but it was weird that they had more trouble with the higher strings than the low ones.  I found that even with the accuracy set for maximum, the tunings weren't always perfect and occasionally required slight tweaking.

**Custom tunings:**

Programming custom tunings is quite easy.  You simply tune the guitar manually to the tuning you want to save, it has to select which of the 6 slots you want to store it in, then you hit enter and all the lights flash green twice to indicate it was stored.  Easy breezy.

**Overall thoughts:**

The system seems to work awesome on standard E, and tunes it very close to perfectly every time.  There is some variation allowed in how close to the note it gets, so sometimes it's a cent or two off.  The default accuracy on this unit is +/- 2.5 cents. Even at it's most accurate, it is +/- 1 cent.  Most of the time it seems to be spot on, but there are variations.  This seems to get more flaky as you tune lower, and I don't think it would be reliable for tunings below C.

I will follow up on the system once I have had a chance to use it in a live situation

Overall

Hope this is helpful to some people who might be interested in this system.

Edit:  Clarity.

Update:

**Daily use:**

Ran in through a full set at practice tonight, and it hit the tuning spot on.  I've figured out how to record the user-programmable tunings more accurately, and it seems to get it right every time now.  It would be pretty easy to do in the dark.

1357615150.0,165tfq,14 great songs that will help take you from beginner to advanced.,slinkynodes,484,148,195,"I posted this in response to another thread but then decided it would be more helpful to share with a larger audience.

Learn these and learn them all the way through. Including the solos if applicable. Learning only pieces of a song is a very bad habit to slip into. The solos may seem impossible at first but keep listening to them and applying the tabs. You'll find that even if the tabs aren't 100% accurate

If you're a beginner you will more than likely not learn these songs over night. Look at this as a one year goal. If you practice hard you'll have them all down in less than 6 months.

Nothing Else Matters - Learn all of it. It has a great solo for beginners.

Pride and Joy - SRV

Rain Song - Led Zeppelin

Babe I'm Gonna Leave You - Led Zeppelin

Time in a Bottle - Jim Croce

Anything from Eric Clapton Unplugged album. Any song will do.

Intro to Crazy on You - Heart

The Ocean - Led Zeppelin

These next two really focus on the ""smooth"" factor

Lenny - Steve Ray Vaughn (SRV)

Little Wing - SRV version

Since I've Been Loving You - Led Zeppelin

The next three are difficult but not impossible. These will open your eyes to how versatile of an instrument the guitar really is. These tunes can be considered essential to your growth as a musician in general.

Mario Bros - This teaches you a lot of chords and everyone loves it.

Family Guy Theme song - another tough one that your friends will love.

Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen, and piano beautifully transcribed to together if you really want a challenge. 
http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/q/queen/bohemian_rhapsody_ver8_tab.htm

All of these (minus the Rain Song, Van Halen, and Zeppelin solo(s) of your choice. They'll 
all take you to the next level as a lead guitar player. After you're satisfied with that, though he could stand to rip it up a bit more occasionally. However, he's a great role model not only as a guitar player but as a musician in general. His styles teach to do what's best for the song and not your ego. You don't want to get stuck in a perpetual state of showing off (Steve Vai) or it just gets boring to the listener.

tldr; I traded redditor clockworkblk one of my custom instruments for a website for my custom guitar business


7 months ago I posted to this community asking for a good ol' fashioned trade [&lt;link&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/uwiox/i_make_zoov_guitars_and_i_want_to_trade_one_for_a/).  I was a struggling custom guitar builder and I *really* needed a website to showcase my work.  This seemed like a great place to turn since r/guitar is a reputable guitar-centric community filled with tech savvy people who could help me build such a page.


So I built [this guitar](http://www.zoovguitars.com/the-work/27-d1-6) for [this redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/uwiox/i_make_zoov_guitars_and_i_want_to_trade_one_for_a/c4zbih0) and he built me my new website www.zoovguitars.com.


It wasn't easy for me to mail 80+ hours of my very own blood, and I mailed an instrument that I couldn't afford to lose, to someone that I didn't know, in exchange for something I couldn't do by myself.  I didn't have the money to pay a web developer and I still don't but I'm well on my way thanks to clockworkblk and r/guitar.


The feedback I have already received from complete strangers regarding my Art has been nothing short of amazing.  People I did not even know existed


So thank you r/guitar for everything you've done for me and my business.

**UPDATE**

 - Added G Major sample


**UPDATE 2**

- Added A Major sample in addition to G major to demonstrate my tutorial

- Added Major Pentatonic

- Added Minor Pentatonic

**UPDATE 3**

- Changed colors of the graph chrome to be more neutral.

**SUMMARY**
This is a tool to both visually demonstrate scales &amp; to teach different positions on the fretboard.

**BACK STORY**

A while WHILE back I made a simple chart to help me learn my scales. It was very simple

As I moved on I figured out that the minor scale has all the exact same notes as its relative major

Years went on and one day a while back I noticed a very odd relationship between colorscales &amp; musical scales. Twelve notes

Just recently I wondered if maybe visualizing the fretboard in colors like I had in those experiments. So I tried it and you can visually see patterns which I KNOW will help certain people who just are more visual people. As I was working on this simple thing I realized that my old scale graph could use a little updating

So right here is what all that work came together to form. I tried my best to polish it and make it look pretty using all the scale information that I discovered. So the major scale includes only colors in the graph that are in the major scale. The letters are the 3rd intervals of the scale. So each type of scale has an overall slight difference in visual look
I feel it comes together in a great visual aid combined with tools to learn all the positions.


**HOW TO USE IT** 

The current version includes:

-	Major Scale (Ionion Mode ) [C]

-	Natural Minor scale (Aeolion Mode) [A]

-	Dorian mode [D]


If I get a good response I’ll add all the modes


So first start with the first page titled “Major Scale.” It looks similar to a fretboard

Below that is the “Hand Positions” section

Let’s begin with A Major with position one. 

We have to set the root at the 5th fret because A is on the 5th fret of both E strings. The numbers at the top are all relative to this specific note. So if it’s “+1” it would be the 6th fret currently. 

Now look at the bottom of the chart for hand positions


So take your pointer finger (Finger 1) and set it on the 4th fret of the low E string. (Interval VII)

Take your middle finger (Finger 2) and set it on the 5th fret of the low E string (Interval I) (The Tonic)

Take your ring finger (Finger 3) and don’t fret, this note is not in the scale, so it’s not played.

Take your pinking (Finger 4) and set it on the 7th fret of the low E string. (Interval II)

So the main goal is to vertically move up the fretboard string by string without shifting (Because this position doesn’t have a shift it in it. So for position 1 your fingers will stay in these exact frets without moving. Go through in order I, IV, V, VI, VII, back to I. Then go down. 

Continue doing this to a metronome and try to memorize this position. Once you are able to play along to something using these frets and not use a reference for this position try another position.

They always say practice one line on its own, I don't know.  But for me it always seemed to [gloss over](http://mccreavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/owl.jpg) the actual sticking point - how exactly do you train your brain to *play two things at once?*

If this problem has a habit of stopping you dead in your musical tracks every so often

My problem was that I was overcomplicating things.  Just ""putting two lines together"" isn't as simple as it appears

**A piece of music is simply a series of notes played one after the other or at the same time.**

Can you play one note after the other?  Of course you can.  Can you play two or more notes at once?  Certainly.  That's what a chord is

    E--------------------------3p0-------------------
    B--------1--------------------------1------------
    G-----------------0--------------------------0---
    D--------2-----------2-----------2-----------2---
    A--3-----------------------3---------------------
    E--------------3-----------------------3---------

That might be a tiny bit more complex than an absolute beginner would be expected to learn (I would recommend finding a simpler exercise)

If you were to split this up into two lines (bass and melody) it might look like this:

**Melody:**

    E--------------------------3p0-------------------
    B--------1--------------------------1------------
    G-----------------0--------------------------0---
    D------------------------------------------------
    A------------------------------------------------
    E------------------------------------------------

**Bass:**

    E------------------------------------------------
    B------------------------------------------------
    G------------------------------------------------
    D--------2-----------2-----------2-----------2---
    A--3-----------------------3---------------------
    E--------------3-----------------------3---------

So you practice both these parts

    E------------------------------------------------
    B--------1---------------------------------------
    G------------------------------------------------
    D--------2---------------------------------------
    A--3---------------------------------------------
    E------------------------------------------------

You can play that, take a look at the next part:

    E------------------------------------------------
    B------------------------------------------------
    G-----------------0------------------------------
    D--------------------2---------------------------
    A------------------------------------------------
    E--------------3---------------------------------

That's even easier!  It's just three notes in a row, there's a good chance you're not playing it well.  Playing well and slowly is much, much tougher and more impressive than playing fast and sloppy.  Are you up to the challenge?  Of course you are!

Now play that first part

    E------------------------------------------------
    B--------1---------------------------------------
    G-----------------0------------------------------
    D--------2-----------2---------------------------
    A--3---------------------------------------------
    E--------------3---------------------------------

You know what you're doing now?  **You're playing two lines at once.**  Bass and melody.  Doesn't seem quite so intimidating now

It doesn't matter how crazy the picking pattern looks, and don't worry about playing the bass/melody parts independently.  That'll come in time, I promise you.

I hope this has been helpful

In my opinion, repair or make your own guitar pedals, and perform countless mods on your guitar. A 25W Weller soldering iron should serve your needs. It'll get hot enough for just about anything you'll need and it won't crap out on you. Stay away from Radioshack like the plague. Their solder and stuff may be fine, but **do not** use their irons. I think I went through 2 of them before I wised up.

I first got into this when I was building my first pedalboard and noticed the ridiculous prices for 6"" patch cables. ($28 is nuts) So I did some research to learn how to build my own. Once I realized the huge markup that some companies ask for with their cables

FYI, and soaked in unicorn blood. I don't buy into a lot of the mojo hype that some people may. I believe the electrons don't really care and that the only factors you should consider are build quality and capacitance (and you may not even care about capacitance).

First

I also found [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smg68qgJa-I) very helpful.

I have some soldering experience, and Gepco were the bulk cable manufacturers I heard the best reviews from. I bought more cable than I needed at that moment to save on shipping costs, because I knew that I was going to need more cable in the future. I just didn't know how much.

For the patch cables, which is a bit lower than the Mogami W2319 (47.3 pF/ft), Mogami W2524 (39.7 pF/ft), Canare GS-6 (49 pF/ft), and Canare GS-4 (47 pF/ft). The pF/ft is going to tell you the capacitance of the cable. This is important because a higher capacitance is going to cut some of the high frequencies from your signal. I'm not 'tone-crazy' like some people, but I figure it's a good factor to consider. The Gepco has shielding that is braided together, so it's tough to twist it up to solder it to ground. So

For connectors, and I'm not sure that they even carry them even more. I've never used a solderless system, but from the problems I've heard people having, it's not something I would ever try. With the research I did, I found that the only benefits that gold connectors really offer you is additional corrosion protection. It doesn't offer any additional *tone*. 

I hope that was helpful.

Because I couldn't ship back just the one pickup that was broken, I had to tear the whole guitar down and pack everything back up.  They got my return processed in early March.  But then, it turns out the pickups I had ordered were on backorder, and they wouldn't be able to ship a replacement until April 22.

This is not a ""defend the Edge"" or ""fuck the Edge, there seem to be people who are unwilling to recognize talent.

I don't know a single real musician who would actually argue that the Edge doesn't have talent.  You simply cannot get to the point that he (and his band) has gotten without it.  This isn't a band that was created by producers or hype, had a couple hits, got bigger, had some more hits, got a couple breaks, and made it big.  Jesus Christ, they did everything exactly as you're supposed to do.  And it worked out for them.

And millions of people love their music.  And thousands of musicians count them among their influences.

Okay, too.  And each of them approaches the guitar, and writing music, in a different way.

Can you honestly tell me that you think someone like the Edge doesn't have talent?  Can you invent a style of playing guitar / creating music that inspires millions?

Do you like U2?  I don't really care

Want to talk about someone who

Stevie Ray Vaughan?  Standard blues through a Tubescreamer.  Talented?  Yep.

John Mayer?  His popular music is awful, and a lot of people love it.  Isn't one aspect of talent being able to create music that stirs emotion in people?

Would you put Kurt Cobain in a room with John Mayer as a talented musician?  What about Stone Gossard?  Angus Young?  Brian Sutton?  Johnny Buckland?

What makes a talented musician?  You define a single metric

Playing guitar has been a tremendous joy in my life and I thought I would share some of the things I've learned and reflect on how things have changed.  **Now is the best time in history to be a guitar player.** Hopefully some of my old man redditor colleagues will be able to commiserate and share as well.

**The quality and selection of guitars available today is amazing.**  When I started, and Mexican Fenders are quite good as well.  You can get a great guitar with any features you want for under $500 (even less) just about anywhere today.

**Play what you want.  Play what you like.** What is considered a ""cool guitar"" today, the height of cool guitars was neon colored pointy headstock shred machines.  By 1991 anyone still playing a guitar like that was uncool.  Fast forward to today and Charvel has been bought by Fender and doing very well selling shredder hotrod guitars.  Another example: Harmony, Kay, Silverstone, Airline, and all manner of department store fiberglass guitars were almost universally considered to be unmitigated shit until guys like Jack White and Dan Auerbach picked them up and made cool sounds with them.  What is ""cool"" has no objective bearing on the guitars themselves.  Play what you want.  Play what you like.

**Never sell a guitar you love.**  If you have bonded with a guitar, don't ever get rid of it... ever.  You will regret it.  I sold a 1991 Ibanez RG 760 in reflective Jewel Blue for $100.  It had an ebony fretboard with the original wizard neck, sharktooth inlays, the whole bit.  I sold it because it was uncool to be seen playing it.  It was, and still is, an amazing guitar.  To this day, it is still the easiest guitar to play I have ever owned.  It is painful to think about even now.

**Protect your ears.**  Amps and drums are dangerously loud.  I have permanent ringing in my ears from years of playing in bands

**Recording is amazing today.**  My first band recorded a six-song demo in a studio.  It cost us $1600.  We had enough money for one take of each tune.  Once mixed, have a band, perform, whatever -- record yourself for posterity.  The quality you can get today is amazing compared to what was available in my lifetime and the cost is next to nothing.

**Practice really does work.** You will reach many plateaus with your technique.  These plateaus can be depressing as hell, or more.  You will run across things that are impossible for you to play at first.  You will be able to play them if you practice deliberately.  Never in 25 years have I failed to make improvement when I practiced something.  Some things came pretty quick to me, like speed picking and bending.  Other things were much more difficult, like in-tune vibrato and music theory.  If you work at it, you will get better.

**Every day I can play guitar

[PETER FRAMPTON’S LOST GIBSON LES PAUL GUITAR](http://i.imgur.com/ITyVY.jpg) FOUND ON CARIBBEAN ISLAND OF CURAÇAO AFTER 32 YEARS 

TWO FANS COLLABORATE TO RETURN FAMED GUITAR

GUITAR PLAYED BY FRAMPTON ON HUMBLE PIE AND 
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE! ALBUMS

Peter Frampton’s long-lost guitar was recently discovered after its disappearance in a plane crash 32 years ago. In 1980, one in Holland and one on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, as well as the CEO of the Curaçao Tourist Board, Frampton was reunited with the guitar in an emotional meeting last month in Nashville, TN. 
The Curaçao Tourist Board helped acquire the guitar from an individual after hearing news that they may indeed have a lead on the long lost and beloved guitar. Together in Nashville, the team confirmed it was the original guitar long missing from Frampton’s collection.
Frampton’s custom guitar was given to him in 1970 by a man named Mark Mariana when Humble Pie played at the Fillmore West. Frampton borrowed Mariana’s guitar for the show and afterward tried to buy it from him
Frampton played the guitar exclusively on Humble Pie’s Rock On and Rocking the Fillmore albums. The guitar also appeared on a number of sessions for other artists including George Harrison, Frampton played the guitar on the electrifying Frampton Comes Alive!, one of the top-selling live records of all time.
Frampton is ecstatic to have the guitar back in his hands once again. “I am still in a state of shock, that it has been returned to me. I know I have my guitar back, but I will never forget the lives that were lost in this crash. I am so thankful for the efforts of those who made this possible…And, now that it is back I am going insure it for 2 million dollars and it’s never going out of my sight again! It was always my #1 guitar and it will be reinstated there as soon as possible -- some minor repairs are needed. And, I just can’t wait to get Mark Mariana on the phone.”",,False,t5_2qi79,True

**What exactly does it do

Very short history lesson. At one time

Fast forward a few years. Steel strings have become standard for most styles of music, I have an idea!"" said someone. ""Let's put a big chunk of metal in there. We'll bend it so we can twist it around and make the neck go back and forth so it'll counteract the force of the strings."" ""BRILLIANT!"" someone else said. Then they had a beer. Or five.

That's what it does. It counteracts the pull of the strings. I guess I could have just typed that

**Should I be scared?**

No. Hell no. A thousand times hell no with mustard. I'm not going to stand here and tell you to start cranking on a stuck truss rod on your granddad's closeted '65 Jazzmaster. There's a time and a place for everything. What I am going to tell you is that if you have any reticence about the truss rod you have been lied to quite a bit and need to stop worrying.

**What do you mean

Some of the most common ones...

- Turn the truss rod a quarter turn
- Don't turn more than have a turn in a day.
- If you put too much pressure on it the truss rod will break the neck.
- If you take all the tension out the strings will break the neck.
- You can't fix a broken truss rod.
- Heavy strings cause warping
- Light strings cause warping.
- Dark elves live under the truss rod cover and will have sex with your dog if you dare go near it.

Stuff like that. To varying degrees there's some truth there

**My dad knows this guy...**

So much misinformation is anecdotal. This guy I know knows a guy that knew this dude one time that had this luthier tell him about some other dude in Alabama that adjusted his truss rod and the neck broke and sent wood shards flying through the air

Yes. Yes he would.

A little thought process turns most truss rod horror stories into easily debunked telephone game BS.

**Will you just get to the point?**

Yes. I will do so now. Going from the list above...

- Turn the truss rod a quarter turn

Wood is an incredibly elastic material in certain ways

- Don't turn more than have a turn in a day.

The theory behind this is that the wood can only take so much stress one way or the other before it cracks or weakens or warps or whatever. Any woodworker will tell you how much you have to tweak wood before you hit that point. Here's a hint: It's far more than the adjustment range of a truss rod. Again this is based on the idea that the wood settles. It doesn't. But then again it might. We'll get to that too.

- If you put too much pressure on it the truss rod will break the neck.

Overtightening won't break your neck. Actually

- If you take all the tension out the strings will break the neck.

No. They'll cause the neck to upbow considerably

- You can't fix a broken truss rod.

I hear this one a surprising amount. It's not true

- Heavy strings cause warping
- Light strings cause warping.

The truss rod is there to provide equilibrium. It's there to counteract the force exerted by the strings

- Dark elves live under the truss rod cover and will have sex with your dog if you dare go near it.

That's just silly. It's the cat you have to be worried about.

**So what are these ""extraordinary circumstances""?**

Wood has two natural enemies. Water and fire. They have different effects on the wood but the ultimate result is the same. Tears, as anyone that lives in a rainy climate can tell you. Acoustics sound dead at certain times of the year without proper care. Even WITH proper care sometimes. This is the main culprit when it comes to neck issues. High humidity can cause the fibers in the wood to swell up. If they do so in one area of a neck but not another... you now have a warped neck. Heat causes wood to expand, leading to the very same warping issues. The more extreme you go one way or the other the more your gear is going to get screwed up.

**Okay

The point is

**An anecdote...**

Years ago I was a QC guy for a guitar manufacturer. Our warehouse was in Texas. No air conditioning. In the summer it would hover around 120F out there. Sometimes higher

One guitar in particular I thought was TOTALLY screwed. I pulled it out of the box and could see the upbow. The relief measured more than a quarter of an inch. That's RELIEF, boxed it, and sent it back out to the warehouse.

This was in June. One thing lead to another and that guitar ended up not shipping for a while.

Fast forward to September. 

We finally get an order for that particular model. I knew which one I was pulling because I'd been contemplating buying it ever since (I kick myself for not doing so). Open up the box, with ZERO buzzing. It was a thing of beauty. Still.

The moral of the story is: Sometimes anecdotes are bullshit. The above story

The moral of the moral is: Your guitar is a living thing. It breathes. It moves. It wants to do what it wants to do. No matter how many times you measure or quantify

Just don't break anything.

The insights into amp design are really fascinating even if you don't have an understanding of electronics. Just the history of amplification is worth a read.

There are sections on valve (tube) versus solid-state from a design perspective that should provide some good food for thought no matter what your thoughts on one or the other are.

I'm not particularly interested in Slash; I give [my own reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/y1xq8/why_do_so_many_people_dislike_slash/c5ryfwq) in that thread why I don't care for his music.

But I found it interesting

I'm cautious of overgeneralizing on either side, whether that be high-shredding guitar heroics or cliche white-guy-blues.  (Classical and Jazz sometimes have the reputations of being ""musician's music"", but those are genres with considerable general audiences, arguably broader than just musicians; I love those genres fwiw).  

When most of us picked up the guitar, I'd rather listen to Captain Beefheart or The Kinks or Joy Division or Sonic Youth (who I don't even like that much) over any of the stuff that is promoted in guitar magazines.  The appeal of the former is that while the guitar as an instrument is central to the sound, it's not music made to showcase the guitar.  It's music intended to convey some kind of artistic vision beyond mere instrumental mastery.

Do others on this sub-reddit feel the same way?  I feel like music that is targeted to guitar players is inherently limited in a creative sense; and I don't mean because it emphasizes technical virtuosity; but rather because the music seems focused upon showcasing the guitar to the exclusion of serving any other function.  In terms of taste (which admittedly is entirely

I should note that I'm not dissing instrumental prowess; I think instrumental prowess should be something to strive for.  What I am saying is that such prowess should be subordinated to an overarching artistic vision; a perfect example of what I'm talking about is Steve Vai's work on the Public Image Limited album ""Album"".  That contains my favorite playing by Vai

Does anyone else feel the same way?  Anyone prefer ""Non-Guitarist"" guitar music over ""Guitarist"" guitar music?

I'm talking about that pleasant feeling on the back of your neck, head, or spine. Music, to me, is just as much a drug as sex, or pharmaceuticals. ",132


I'll explain what I mean by ""Stimulation"" a little: I, neck, and all the way down my spine. It is very similar to what I feel after a good stretch, post-orgasm, after eating good meal, or the ""Euphoria"" I feel while on the come up of LSD, or while on nitrous oxide (there are a billion different things that make me feel it


I have come to know these tingles as ""ASMR"" (which may or may not be correct). This might not be the correct


These ""ASMR"" responses are incredibly common when I am listening to really complex or interesting music or, drums, etc.). I theorize that some of you guys have felt this, because musicians tend to be smart and observant people. 



Here are some questions that I would ask any that are interested in this phenomena to answer:


**1) What drugs have you taken in the past? I ask because I think that most of the people that experience this are predisposed to altering their mind and body. Also


**2) Do you think about your own consciousness and mental health in non-westernized fashion (Meditation, spirituality, etc.)?**


**3) Are you interested in brain chemistry and pharmacology? Are you interested in the science of your emotions


**4) Have you always felt ""Stimulation"" from music or guitar?**


**5) When was the first time you remember feeling stimulated in this way? When was the last time?**


**6) Do you or are you interested in seeking out this feeling? Have you experienced it in non-musical context?**


**7) This whole subject is scorned by popular science and probably society as a whole. What is needed to legitimize the study of this field? Have you ever discussed this with anyone else before?**


**8) The final and most important question: What triggers these feelings


I'm really hoping to find some other psychonauts or guitar shamans. This topic is one of the most interesting things in my life

1356916021.0,15p69y,"I have some advice to help you get out your ""ruts""",,274,39,42,"A lot of guitarist tend to just play songs or riffs from other musicians and never really have anything to ""say"". Like if you told me to play guitar right now

(edit): see i used to make stuff up in-between my technical practice and had a lot of ideas. but i wouldn't play more than 10 minutes at a time until before i would go to the next exercise. this is different by forcing you to play more than you may want to hear yourself play (at first). instead of when you dont like your playing you stop, run past the flag, and access new worlds.

Here is the way i do it (atleast did it for a while):

Step 1: get your guitar

Step 2: get a metronome (optional but helps to have a balance between using one and not)

Step 3: Set up a timer for an hour and make sure you have no       knowledge of how much time you have left. 

Step 4: Play things that aren't pre-written. Just mess around..

Step 5: If youre playing electric

You'll find yourself wanting to quit, but youre forced to, so you put little effort into coordinating your fingers or paying attention to what stings you hit, because you dont want to play and youre EXPRESSING that.

 But this REALLY helps with coming up with stuff in the long run and really unifying your ""spirit"" with your guitar. where eventually you may not need to think to like what YOU'RE playing. This may help with playing how you ""feel"". (Keep in mind just because your playing may not sound radio-friendly doesnt mean it's not something youre extracting from your ""spirit"". Because as we all know
 
Try to not keep yourself inside a scale or in the 7 ""right"" notes for the whole time. Experiment. You'll do more things differently the more you open yourself up and the more you play. It's another method to keep yourself from getting into a rut. The more you play, you push on and past that state of mind, instead of putting the guitar down.

You see a lot of guitarists who make you go, i wanna play well!"". Well you don't see all of those people only practicing technical things. they play, and a lot of them are like you who may have never forced themselves to play for an hour straight, but just had the luxury of playing with others and being able to form a band and being forced in another way to play guitar that makes you think or at least amplify YOU. So they sound ""good"" because they've had a lot of trial and error making things up as they go, it just seems like something in the background because to a lot of us, it may be more fun to play with other musicians not even really getting specific about ""what"" we play.

This is a guy who encompasses what i want to make a reality to a musician's playing and having them feel like they're thinking on their feet as much as this guy can (in my humble opinion):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YAsue-KM0o  (start around 2:50)

[IMPORTANT] Doing this ""practice"" helps with developing your ""real"" side of your guitar playing and over a week/month doing this daily may skyrocket your playing (i think it did for me). For you aren't really thinking when you're doing technique based exercises and i say ""real"" because improvising would be something you'd do if you were jamming with other musicians. 

It's funny how we practice things we hardly ever do when actually trying to play our instruments in a musical atmosphere and this (hopefully) addresses the things youre not happy with when you go in and jam with someone else that no amount of technique practice could fix nearly as fast as something like this (in my opinion)

You can also use this method when trying to accomplish other goals. A handful could be:

-Playing an hour straight with no pick, and whatever else you can do with your hand to promote noise. (getting your tapping more accurate/finger style more controllable)

-Play an hour straight not minding what notes you hit

-Only being able to play chords. Helps with, but generally, playing for an hour straight helps you keep up with yourself and transitioning to the next idea you want to execute in general. practicing chords is another area where you may want something to ""go-to"" in your playing.

What doing this exercise did for me:

-Made me eventually dislike technical practice (even though i still do it to keep being able to do what i want to do on the guitar) and i can sit down and just play for 45 minutes without any motivation to help my playing

-Allows me to do things i want to do at a faster pace with less thinking. (I hope we all strive for this part of our playing to be like speaking in our native tongues)

-Being able to just keep up with a drummer and making the guitar do things i want to be done on it.

-Helping me know what notes sound like before i hit them. No i dont practice reading music or learing names of notes. The countless times you just play on the guitar and look at where your fingers are (in my opinion) is the best way to connect with the guitar like a language. its like what victor wooten says

I know a lot of people who are a bit lazy with their theory practice and only focus on learning songs and really grope in the dark a bit when trying to improvise or go off from knowing one or two patterns (I was one of those people for years) I would just like to really press how absolutely crucial knowledge of your scales is to becoming a better musician.

I've been playing for nearly 15 years now, and no little finger use.

I've progressed onto the acoustic over the last couple of years, and the fleshy bit under my thumb cramps up like a bitch.

For some reason, until it was suggested by my girlfriend, a holistic therapist, that I get a stressball.

I've been using it daily, rolling it around my hand, inbetween my fingers etc.

In just under a week I can play for longer, and the cramps I get in my thumb are as good as gone.

Seriously, get yourself on eBay or something similar, and grab a pack of these things; it'll change your life :)

The idea is that guitarists uploading themselves playing using Instagram video can all use the #Instariff tag as a way of being found by others in order to get feedback, likes etc. I'm currently running the @Instariffs account on Instagram which already has 100 followers, and the hashtag has over 100 uploads in just a few days. The twitter account will eventually start running 'riff of the week' shoutouts etc. once it has enough followers and contributors. So far, it would appear the idea has potential.

Instagram video is limited to 15 seconds

I have listened to plenty of his material and -remembering that music taste is subjective- I do not enjoy it at all. Clearly he is considered one of the best guitarists of all time but can anyone explain to me exactly why? All I can find in a Google search are people saying he did things no-one else had done

Did he really do anything that any one else playing around with a guitar wouldn't have figured out themselves? 

Is there proof that Hendrix invented any sounds or techniques and no-one else was doing the same thing already? Is there proof he wasn't just a commercial success?

I'm not here to question the authenticity of his reputation






Edit: Well thanks to everyone who had constructive input here. I understand a little more about the reasons Hendrix is worshiped so

What I have noticed however, and all those questions have been downvoted to hell, yet emotional, non-constructive ramblings about how amazing he is get upvoted. This basically confirms a lot of what I already suspected. It's O.K. to ask yourself why you like something or someone, you know. It's called critical thinking, try it sometime.

1357333710.0,15yxze,"If you like Strats/Teles in the slightest, then I must recommend G&amp;L guitars.   It was Leo Fenders last and greatest contribution to the guitar world.  He said ""I've made the most popular guitars in the world now I am going to make the best.""  And he was NOT lying!",nanuku,331,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15yxze/if_you_like_stratsteles_in_the_slightest_then_i/
   I was making a comment in a thread and decided that this company deserves some exposure.  I am a huge gear-head and really look for great quality combined with good prices.  And G&amp;L seriously delivers in both areas: 

A little story illustrating G&amp;L's fine quality build:  My brother used to play the thickest strings he could find.  I know he played 14s for a long time and I think he even got up to 16s for at least a little while.  And he didn't like to tune down.  He liked those bridge cables at standard tuning!  Well, most commanding sounds I had ever heard.  So I started doing some research.  I was recommended to try G&amp;L.  The proponnent said they were probably ""the toughest damn guitars you'll find out there""  Needless to say the ONLY guitars that could take 16 guage strings day in and day out and just shrug it off like it was nothing.  I'm telling you, you may never need that type of strength from a guitar but I was seriously impressed and with the fit and finish, play-ability and tremendous sound these guitars produce, they are one of a kind in my book.  I feel like I got a deeper perspective due to my and my brothers relationship with them.  He only plays G&amp;L and they made it so that he never had to compromise his very unique sound.

""If you are into strats or teles, G&amp;L.  Not sure if you've heard of them, they slip by alot of people.  Basically after Leo Fender was told he had like 6 months to live , he sold Fender guitars.  Then he went to work at Ernie Ball Musicman, making some of their best/most iconic guitars and some of their best pickups.  Well he wasn't dieing so he opened up his own guitar company and in his own words he said ""I made the most famous guitar in the world- now I am going to make the best guitar in the world""  If Leo's saying that-I am most definitely listening.  I couldn't agree with him more-I think he really did make his best guitars with that company and that's saying alot because I love his guitars.  The G&amp;Ls are like fenders made with the precision of Gibson custom shop.   Every (US made) G&amp;L I've ever played blew me away! I still haven't found one that I didn't find amazing.  When he was still there, they even had a line of student guitars that were better than most custom shops products.  They were and are the epitome of class when it comes to strat and tele type guitars I don't think you can do any better no matter were and how hard you look.  Basically a used $500 G&amp;L will give you the vibe and quality of a $1000-2000 Fender custom shop job.""

Plus they have some of the most unique pickups that I've seen.  Fender considered them to be such a departure from regular pickups that he wouldn't even call them pickups
I mean for a good example is the Z-coils, the more I found out, the more impressed I was with his engineering prowess and his creative talent.  If he hadn't been told he was going to die soon, he probably never would have sold Fender to CBS and I think the guitars quality would have stayed very high and we would have a different yet much better ""Fender"" these days.  However, I also think selling Fender is what made him change is approach with G&amp;L and quality probably wouldn't have been so high on his list of features for his new company.  I also think that the time at Ernie Ball made him think very advanced designs especially concerning pick ups.  

Little fact G&amp;L stands for George and Leo as in George Fullerton and Leo Fender.  The two guys responsible for some of the most enduring guitar designs in history.",,t5_2qi79,1357335479.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15yxze/if_you_like_stratsteles_in_the_slightest_then_i/

* All of the painting is done by a guy with a hand sprayer like you'd see in an auto body shop. They do this instead of automated painting so no two of their guitars will have the exact same paint job.

When you heat milk and add vinegar you end up with a kind of plastic made from chains of casein from the milk.

I decided to try to make picks

Here's a clip of me using one:
http://youtu.be/Ud-3-txmglY

And a closeup of the pick:
http://i.imgur.com/hOaW2Fo.jpg


So

What you need:
Milk (skimmed is best)
White vinegar.
Baking soda.
A sieve.
Paper towels.
Foil or baking paper sheets.
Something flat and heavy (cook book


First mix milk into a teaspoon or two of baking soda and make a paste.

Then add two cups of milk

For heating in the microwave I found 1:30 @ 1000w works well. In a pan

Once hot

Place paper towels in a sieve and pour the mixture though

It's quite hard to work with because it is crumbly like a strange cottage cheese but work it into a ball

Lay a template of the pick shape you want over the plastic and cut around it

Be careful (as the picks are delicate) and add another sheet of foil on top. Then place the flat heavy object on them. This prevents curling while they dry.

Leave them for 48-72 hours in a warm dry place.

Sand them roughly to clean them up and sharpen/smooth the point on some carpet.

1369950478.0,1fd4cl,Sweep Picking - Fundamentals of Technique (x-post r/metalguitar,SeraphSlaughter,234,38,39,"Hey r/guitar, we'll be focusing purely on technique

So

**The Right Hand**

The name of the technique has ""picking"" right in the title, we simply continue in the direction we were picking on the previous string. This allows us to execute some interesting patterns when we glide across the strings quickly. It's not quite strumming a chord, since, in that case, the aim there is to get all of the notes out ""simultaneously"" (or, rather, as close as the strumming motion will allow); with sweeping, because how to do this is contextual to what sort of sweep shape you're playing

**The Left Hand**

Obviously, but it won't help. Why not? Think about how you keep extra strings ringing out when you're playing plain chords on your guitar - if you're strumming away, you can't lock your right hand down to mute the unneeded strings, so what do you do? You rely on your left hand to mute the other strings of course! By gently resting parts of your fingers against strings you don't need, you deaden them. In sweeping, it is the same: it is generally the LEFT hand that is keeping the sound ""clean"". The key is getting the sync down.


**The Sync**

Let's start putting this together with an example:

    l----------9-----------l
    l-----10-----10--------l
    l-11-------------11----l
    l----------------------l
    l----------------------l
    l----------------------l

Here's a basic starter shape. You'll want to use your 3rd (ring) finger to hit the 11th fret on the G, and play this as eighth notes - two notes per click of the metronome. Let's start sweepin'.

What you're going to do is, and just as your pick is about to hit the next note, lift up the finger that was fretting the previous note enough to get the note to stop ringing and mute it - you may also use the tip of the finger that is about to fret the next note to deaden the string you have just fretted further. The finger that frets the next note will usually also help to deaden the previous string - again, this depends on the shape.

Ok, the 9 on the E, right? NOPE! Think about it -- if we carry the sweep and continue to pick down, when we have to up-pick the 10 on the B again, we have to lift our pick back up over the E! This flies in the face of the economy of motion sweep picking is all about - so, if we have something like this, and immediate shift in direction, in this case, UP, start picking down again. If we played the lick twice through


    l---------9-10p9------l
    l-----10--------10----l
    l-11---------------11-l
    l---------------------l
    l---------------------l
    l---------------------l

Play this one as triplets, we have to pick the E string twice. Therefore, we actually will carry the motion of the sweep down through the E string, but since we are immediately shifting direction at the G string again, we do have to set that up - resulting in a pattern of DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, we're talking about technique for now.

Ok

    l--------------9------------l----------------10------------l
    l---------10-----10--------l-----------10-------10---------l
    l-----11-------------11----l-------11---------------11-----l
    l-12--------------------12-l--12------------------------12-l
    l--------------------------l-------------------------------l
    l--------------------------l-------------------------------l

Here's two four string sweeps to add a little extra. Again, but using just one finger! Add some hammered/pulled off notes at the top and bottom of these sweeps to get used to both styles of sweep-direction changes. Again, just use a comfortable one for now - worry about theory later.

Here's a final shape that's a killer. It's a 5 stringer

    l---------------------10h14p10-----------------l
    l-----------------12-------------12------------l
    l-------------11---------------------11--------l
    l--------12-----------------------------12-----l
    l--9h14------------------------------------14--l
    l----------------------------------------------l

Remember - be conscious of how you're transferring each time you change direction. Start slow

That's the technique lesson. Next time, and where/how to use them in a song. Learning this technique takes time, don't feel like you can tear through this lesson in a day. In actual lessons, I would be stopping you and commenting on your playing, but I do not have the luxury of doing that via text. Feel free to ask questions in the comments, or let me know if something wasn't clear/you could use another example. Now make like a broom and SWEEP!",,,,

EDIT: Here's the Minor Scale shapes sheet http://i.imgur.com/Schakxv.jpg?1

I made this image today as I had a breakthrough on my own when I discovered that *every* major and minor scale uses **the exact same pattern.**

Take a look at the portion in the top right to see what I mean.

I think I'll be making a Minor scale chart with all the minor scale roots soon. If anyone is interested in that

Hopefully this will help someone as much as it helped me.

EDIT 3:

From user /u/GrantSolar

I don't think the formatting is going to work as good on here. Check this link for his post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1ccn0y/for_beginners_to_fretboard_logic_major_and_minor/c9foxdo Again, you will need to shift up a fret when moving from the G string to the B string, and the opposite (move down one fret) when moving from the B string to the G string.

Fun fact: The reason that you must shift any pattern - pentatonic, A to D, D to G, and B to E) has two whole notes between the open string notes, where as between G and B, there is only one note: A.

EDIT 4: The original copy+paste of /u/GrantSolar post sucked, when I get home this evening I will record myself going over this pattern on the fretboard and show you exactly what I mean by only needing the one pattern. I promise it is worth knowing once the concept is grasped. I suck at tutorials. :/

Yes, but here are the results

There were 1131 total responses

Type of guitar - dominated by electric, which quite a few people misunderstood - my mistake, question wasn't worded that clearly.  Other types were generally just specific brands, although [a few were insteresting](http://i.imgur.com/QTjSMDt.png)

[Type of guitar](http://i.imgur.com/8LnpACK.png)

Type of music - not surprisingly

By far the most interesting part of the survey were the responses to 'What genre/sub-genre would you say your primary music type is' - some of the more interesting types:

* ??  
* 6 string Wankery  
* Adult Contemporary Progressive Death Metal  
* Alternative with too may arpeggios  
* arty post-proto-indie doompop jazzcore with hints of gypsy techno-pop  
* Beatles and Pixies had a child given up for adoption and raised by Frank Zappa  
* Classical-metal-bluesasauras rex  
* corpse-grinding-doom-polka (the respondent also listed their guitar as pointy
* experimental noise (I think this is how my neighbors would describe my playing)  
* fuck if I know  
* I hate it
* Jack White sucks.  
* lazy electro dub rock (apparently either someone took the survey twice or two people play this)  
* melodic anthemic oi punk?  
* norweigan-black-doomgaze  (someone may have copied from the quiz)  
* Orgasmicly awesome tele driven sex  
* Pink Floyd Ennio Morricone Pat Metheny and Metallica go to the Soup Kitchen for Empenadas  
* pre-post ; you won't understand bro  
* Prozac bulldozer  
* Psh. I trancsend genres
* Swedish-grey-fearstare  
* vegetarian progressive grindcore  

I was going to try and do some correlations of guitar type to music type and maybe some others

breakdown and I was to the point where I just didn't give a damn
about anything. One day I came across a Martin guitar in a case
and I just decided to take it. It was one of the stupidest things I
have ever done. When I came to the realization of what I did and
the possible consequences I was scared for weeks that I was going to get caught and lose my job and worse. But as time passed I realized
that I had got away with it. Over the years I have never since
taken anything from someone like that again and I have always
been ashamed so I never told anyone until now. I don't know who
it belonged to
received a claim and were reimbursed for the value of the guitar.
I used this to justify my actions to myself
knew I did something really terrible.

I've been thinking about what I can do now to try to rectify this
in some way but I don't know how. I don't have any way to find
the owner and I thought about giving it away or selling it and
doing something good with the money
is reported stolen (I checked the serial number with online
resources but found nothing reported). Anyway I am interested
in what you all think about this and if you have any ideas. Thanks
for listening.


**Edit:** Thanks for all the honest feedback. I know how fucked up a thing it was to do and what a douche, I have responsibilities and commitments now that I'm not willing to jeopardize for this. It may be selfish, but that is just the truth.

I am going to take the advice of sending the guitar back to Martin and
seeing if they can contact the owner. It sounds like the guitar is likely to be registered there so there is a good chance. I am going to include a letter explaining what happened and that if they can't find the owner to try to find someone who deserves it. Just as a point of closure for all of you the guitar in question is a 1973 D-18.

Up for Auction is a 2011 ?  Fender Strat.  Here is the Story.  My husband was an avid guitar player
Fender Custom Shop USA made Strat that  he loved.  He became ill and had a very time holding it
it for more that 10 minutes and he had to stop.

So we went in search of a Luthier who could possibly build him a replica of it.   We finally found one in December of 2009.  In February after
time spent in the hospital

He agreed that he could duplicate it exactly
it was done.

It body is  made of Alder
the exact match of the 1990.

When the Luthier was done
basically a third of the original.

While traveling home from the Luthier's my husband became ill and I took him directly to the hospital.  

He passed and never got to play the guitar only for a few seconds when we picked it up.

Total price to have it custom built was $ 2290.00  

____________

I kind of feel bad for winning the guitar for only $500 bucks and change. 

But

This...will be interesting.

Recently built a Jazzmaster loosely based off of the Fender Elvis Costello edition that was in production a little while back. 

The body (extra light alder, just had to add the tuning machines. I finished the body with a walnut stain and a satin nitro lacquer. The goal was basically to make this thing look like a piece of furniture, which I think worked out pretty well.

Went with some Seymour Duncan Antiquity II pups which give it that bright and shimmery Jazzmaster sound. Was considering some hand wound pups, but apparently the Jazzmaster/Jaguar bridges are generally crap, so I'm happy to have one I can rely on.

Had a friend of mine set it up for me (I use 11s and love low action

But I absolutely can't stand when I see a guitarist playing a cover song and he plays everything the way it is on the recording. ESPECIALLY with the solo.

It's an interesting discussion

If I wanted to hear the song played exactly like it is on the album, doing music this way is just glorified Guitar Hero. Really, that's what it is. You go up on stage and you mash your fingers down on the frets in the same order and same way that the dude who originally recorded it did, and hopefully the same thing comes out. Your performance is evaluated based on how close it matches up with the recording artist.

Like, I can hear that anytime. You might say ""Oh, but my own solo wouldn't be as good as the original!"" and yeah, you're probably right. But, and maybe this is just me, I would rather hear you play a mediocre solo that comes from your heart and was created by your mind, than to hear you play someone else's solo perfectly. 

Because music's not about being the best.

Maybe I'm crazy. I know some people don't think like I do. They hear a cover, as well. But me? That doesn't interest me. 

They say the original solo is sacred, and let the purists go listen to the original in their cars if they don't like it.",,False,,t5_2qi79,False,,

also here's some video of the CNC/machining (10~ minutes)


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBnLNtQ92qA

there's some info on the pictures in the gallery but here's the specs;


* Eden Neck
* body is made of Paulownia (very light but soft timber) for the back 
and 10mm of Galaxy Black Granite


the body is designed after the B.C Rich Ignitor

(I know I know, even if a little ugly.. sort-of) 

though I've touched up the horns a bit

* body is also 55mm thick

* GFS 14:1 gold tuners

* Floyd Rose Special

* GFS Power Rail humbuckers (Bridge + Neck)

* Overwound single coil middle (bought from GFS



as for the electronics we have

* 3 way toggle switch

* 2x volume knobs

* 3x DPDT switches

the first on the left (from the players POV) is a coil split for both humbuckers

the second adds and removes the single coil from the circuit 

the third switches the polarity of the single coil's wiring



that's about it, to help spread the load.

though the weight of the guitar is somewhat significant


if anyone has questions

1334764339.0,sg5l0,[NGD] Gibson Thunderhorse,Subhoney,183,27,72,"About a month ago

Gibson, even though it's gimmicky and silly at times. I've bought several of their guitar-of-the-month series (SG Diablo comes to mind) for their idiosyncrasies; often, these guitars match my playing style and desire better than the Gibson standard.

The Thunderhorse is no exception.

This guitar is probably one of the strangest ""Signature"" guitars ever made; the design is by a fellow named Brendan Small, is the signature guitar of  Skwisgaar Skwigelf, the guitarist for the fictional deathmetal band Dethklok. The interesting (and incredibly smart in my opinion) thing is that nowhere on the guitar is Dethklok, Skwisgaar, Metalocolypse, or even Brendan Small mentioned. To someone unfamiliar with the show, the guitar is just a pretty thing with no affiliation. It does say ""Thunderhose"" on the truss guard. 

I bought the guitar from a music store, but it was a trade situation; a Gretsch Powerjet for the Gibson, one-to-one. The guitar's MSRP is $2800, and it goes for $1650 off the shelf. 

The setup from the Gibson factory (and the music store, even going so far as to offer a setup plan where you pay a fee and get something like four setups a year) was *fucking terrible*. If you riffed at all on the low e-string, it would literally pop out of the nut and flail on the side of the guitar. This is one of the reasons the shop took the one-to-one trade: I called 'em on the awful setup job, and told them the first thing I'd have to do is replace the nut. 

Which I didn't. I took the Thunderhorse to a luthier and he was able to pull out an ULTRA low-action setup without replacing the nut. He did have to carve a little bit, and the binding is cream. They distinctly don't match. 

After setup, like the new-model Les Paul Customs. It isn't a 1950s fretless wonder baseball bat neck, and thank goodness: I like 'em kinda thin and really fast. Compared to a late model Les Paul Traditional, this is a much slicker guitar. If you take the entire neck-thickness spectrum into account, it could probably be described as medium to thin. The nut is the same size as the standard Explorer: 1.695"". The cream binding looks great too; reminiscent of the Les Paul Custom in the same finish.

The guitar's body is non-chambered mahogany. It's the same thickness and material as a standard Explorer. If you're comfortable playing a standard

The electronics are different. The two-volume-one-tone pattern holds for the knobs, this is where the standard Explorer an the Thunderhorse depart. When I think Explorer, I think of a dark-but-bright sound (thanks mainly to the Edge and his Vox amps). This guitar is even darker and less bright (I use an Orange Thunderverb 50, but did test on a Vox AC30 stereo rig). It has less output than my Les Paul (I may could change that by upping the poles and lowering the pickups' bodies), and has a generally darker sound. I find myself pulling the volume upward and the bass downward to pull any degree of sparkle out of the guitar. It's muddy, but in a good way. Great for chug-style down-tuned stuff, or, the blues. You won't get that SRV kind of single coil sound of this beast

All in all, comfortable, and (at least to a silverburst fanatic like me; I have three now) utterly gorgeous. The MSRP is totally ridiculous (even the list price at the store), but, if you can find a used model at the $1000 price-point, you're in for a great guitar for the money. The guitar came with a HSC and all the candy as well. My biggest complaint was that it wasn't gig-ready when I pulled it out of the case, but I shouldn't complain too hard. That fact got me the deal.

My next buy will probably be the limited run [silverburst ES-335](http://www.guitarvillage.co.uk/admin/pages/upload/Gibson%20Semi/ES335_silverburst.jpg) if one ever pops up on the used market.

I've had some good times here but overall there are some things I don't like about this subreddit that I don't think will ever change. I originally decided to unsubscribe last year and almost as I clicked the button I was asked to moderate and so wanted to help rather than abandon. On the whole I've had some great discussion here but I've been frustrated on many occasions by many things from the more subtle spamming, hiding at the bottom of a thread. 

Some of this is attributable to the perceived high-population of new guitarists

I am removing my moderator status with immediate effect and will be silently moving on. I have no intention of changing my mind or seeking some kind of validation here but as I leave I think it is only basic courtesy to say why. Thank you for the good times

EDIT * It looks as though I forgot to label the post GEAR when I posted. Apologies if this breaks the sub-reddit rules. I promise to stake myself to a beach at low tide and await my fate. 

Edit 2* There are some Youtube videos up that give an example of how it sounds if you want to hear it. 

[30 seconds of shred](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKIASKP8jtg&amp;feature=youtu.be) 30 seconds of him looking bored and playing with a fair bit of distortion. 

[2 minutes without gain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hr4S1Bu_lI) 2 minutes (or thereabouts) of clean tone using various pickup selections.

[The Maszhcaster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omx28z-O2kg) Clean tone again for 24 seconds. 

Edit 3* Some words from the man himself:

Cheers for responses! It's nice to know that the work is appreciated after spending so many hours working on it. The essay below details the minor points that brother might have missed.

The body came from England for £55 pre-routed as a standard Tele. The neck pickup hole had to be widened to accommodate the Di-Marzio Chopper as It was slightly too big. The body is made of Ash and remains unfinished except for an ultra thin wax sealing on it to keep the design clean. 

The neck is rock maple with a rosewood fingerboard
The pickups are DiMarzio, tone and volume - dead simple. i didn't want the tone weakness that most Telecasters have so opted for high output bad boys!

The tattoo is a design on my wife's back and after being questioned about whether or not I would ever get one decided I would try my hand at burning one into the guitar I was making. The woodburner cost £16 Earth pounds-sterling.

The hardest part is patience to be honest. I had to freehand the design from the design on the computer (didn't want to cheat and print it). That took 4.5 hours in one night- hand cramped up and couldn't draw any longer. Finished the pencil drawing the next night and bought some carbon paper and stencilled it onto the body. The design around the Geisha snake woman was all freehand improvised 'Japanese style' doodling basically

The burning took 5 days/ nights at roughly 4.5 hrs a day. It's fairly easy to do so long as you go slow and don't push into the wood for longer than 2 seconds at a time. to be honest Ash isn't the best type of stuff to burn on and the grain on the guitar isn't COMPLETELY flat so next time

We estimate the retail cost if I were to sell it would be £1100. That estimate comes from guys who make furniture etc and that's their rough guess which is quite generous I thought!

I'm getting a customised cab next, matching guitar and cab!

**Background**

In a [discussion about Nirvana's Unplugged concert](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r18au/ama_request_somebody_who_was_in_the_audience_the/) someone brought up an early cover of ""Heartbreaker"" that Nirvana did

It gave me an idea. I was going to put up a clip of a very popular artist playing their own music

**The Tarp**

I posted a link to a [Soundcloud with a performance of the solo section of ""*Stairway to Heaven*""](http://soundcloud.com/tibbon/stairway-to-heaven-solo) and claimed it as my own. Yet, but it was good enough for 20,000 audience members to not boo him offstage and ask for a refund. 

** The response **

This is where things got interesting imo. I posted this to both /r/guitar ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/r1jjg/my_bands_rendition_of_the_solo_from_stairway_to/)) and /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/r1jkn/bands_rendition_of_the_solo_section_of_stairway/))asking for feedback. On each it was downvoted more than it was upvoted

- *""Guitarist sounds pretty err
- *""the guitar solo is very very very sloppy. i mean its not just sloppy its out of tune. i think the guitar is out of tune.""*
- *""I hate to say it
- *""Sorry mate

And when I asked in response to the one if the performance would be worthy of showing Jimmy Page:

*""Seems it's just that touch beyond you. Slow it down, so if you nail that, the whole thing will sound better.
Also try toning down the distortion a bit, you sound incredible with it cranked up.""*

**My Thoughts**

I feel that if I had posted a clip saying, claiming it to be mine, it was perceived as flawed. 

To me this says that people can't really separate the artist from the performance all that well. If you like the artist

A great teacher who taught me a lot and left a lasting impression on me.  His last name started with Senj or Seng as in Sengakowski (pronunciation and spelling is estimated).  

I remember sitting in awe of him playing Eruption (from Van Halen) and his patience with sitting and watching me play.  I spent hours translating Stairway to Heaven into Tabs and showed to to him which I remember him being really impressed.  He was a really good guy and I'd love to get back in touch with him.

In all fairness I am not that bad

I started playing guitar because my Dad had a 12 string Washburn and the moment I picked it up I just fell in love with the clear and crisp tones. After my first few guitars you could say I continued to play as a way to express my creativity. 

A lot of people like me in my early days had a misconception about music thinking it is simply a creative art - Music is more of a creative science.

You could say I am a creative guitarist who is self taught

When you pick up your guitar for a jam session you might want to once again express your creativity

We see the stars we like, see someone else pulling off an amazing rendition and think ""I'll have that down in a day"" - We have a problem - We're seeing the end result, and feeling anxious already because we're not there yet. 

How do they play that song so perfectly? What is their secret

What I've realized is to play something well

IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS - You will always suck! I know I still suck (a bit). 


Let me be very clear - there is nothing creative about repetition. And this is what makes the difference between a good guitarist who still sucks and a great guitarist who doesn't. There is no magic - What it comes down to is who put in the most amount of repetition. 

This is not a glamorous process. I always feel like I'm a robot when I'm putting in the repetition

Go right back to basics for each riff. Play it damn slow and get every note 100% correct. Every little subtle sound - play it damn tight. Every little hammer and slide - nip them in the butt! Expect to put in 10 times the effort than you originally thought was your worst case scenario. I'm coming across this learning blues. Blues sounds great if it's tight

DON'T SPEED UP TOO QUICKLY and get all excited because you're nearly there. Then at speed you're making mistakes all over the place. 

Your live playing might pass off as semi decent to a bunch of drunk people


I know it sounds boring, it is about time we stop thinking we're guitar heros, and start putting in much more time and have a much more professional approach and be willing to repeat , repeat, repeat, and slowly, speeding up over time - gradually. 

If it's too robotic for you

1356380344.0,15dzus,"THE ADVICE THREAD: I went through most of the old ""Advice for Beginners"" and ""What are your best pieces of advice"" posts and summed up the most common responses. (You're welcome).",YouFuckingRetard,178,33,15,"Here are the top pieces of advice for beginners and anyone else struggling! It may not be the best advice

**Most Common Advice:**

* **Learn Scales/Chords/Music Theory.** By far the most prevalent. Learning scales and chords help take you from, then this finger..."" to ""Oh, it's C!"" so you don't have to think about where your fingers are going; it becomes automatic. *Theory makes learning new songs, soloing, and writing new music much easier.* Practice them in every position and every key (you should probably learn positions and keys). At the very least, learning these will not make you worse at guitar.

* **Take Lessons.** You'll have to swallow your pride, ask a friend who can already play, go to a local music store, or use the internet. Almost everyone in the threads who recommended lessons recommended www.justinguitar.com.

* **Learn how to tune your guitar (and other basic maintenance).** Your playing will sound shitty if you are ridiculously out of tune. Either learn how to tune by ear or get a good electronic tuner. Learning other basic maintenance, and setting your intonation, will make your guitar easier to play and improve your playing.

* **Improve your rhythm with a metronome.** Or a drum loop machine. Or play along with records. That little click will piss you off so much

* **Play with other musicians.** It'll help you rise up to their level. Plus it's always good to be humbled every now and then by someone better than you; it keeps your ego in check.

**Almost as common:**

* **Practice.** Plenty of musicians shun the word, breaking it down into smaller pieces, mastering the small pieces one by one, then putting those pieces back together. This takes focus and determination, but you improve a lot faster.

* **Use your ear.** Learn songs and other solos by ear. That is, **your ear trumps your theory**. If it sounds right, it is right. Plus, on a more advanced level of theory, the ""wrong note"" works out.

* **Learn songs all the way through

     * Ask a random person if they've heard of Joe Satriani. Or Yngwie Malmsteen. Or Michael Angelo Batio. Then ask that same person if they know John Lennon. Or Bob Marley. Or Kurt Cobain. Let me know when someone knows more people from the first group then the second.
     * [Which audience would you rather have?](http://www.leragecomics.com/index.php/rage-comics/le-guitar/).

* **Get out of your comfort zone.** It's not fun playing with someone who only plays rock. Or blues. Or punk. The more styles you know

**Not as common (but still very important):**

* **Either alternate pick or finger pick.** I'm sure there are plenty of guitarists out there who either use only their thumb (John Lee Hooker comes to mind) or only strum down (Punk Rock)

* **Have Fun.** Experiment with the scales, and have a blast doing it. If you're not enjoying yourself, what's the point?

* **Fix your Posture.** It'll make playing easier and save you years of hand cramps and carpal tunnel.

* **With gear, you will get a cheap, shitty guitar/amp/effect. If you buy used gear, you get used (but not necessarily cheap) gear. Do your homework before you buy, or you're wasting your money on something that will break down or end up collecting dust in the corner.

* **Work with dynamics.** You might find out that playing something quiet can be just as intense as turning everything up to 11. Bonus practice exercise from Jerry Garcia: Turn everything up all the way

**Last but not least: NEVER, GIVE UP.** The truth is, everyone sucks when they first start. What separates the musicians you know from those that never were is that the good ones stuck with it until they didn't suck anymore. It takes time, effort, focus, and a lot of frustration, but it's worth it.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15dzus/the_advice_thread_i_went_through_most_of_the_old/
