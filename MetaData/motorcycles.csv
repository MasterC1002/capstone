Super short version of the story - A student at the University of Arizona, plowed into a friend of a friend on his Harley and put him in the hospital in a pretty bad shape  (pic [here](http://i.imgur.com/I6yax.jpg) - warning, it's not pretty).  Then she skipped her arraignment for her 3 felonies and 3 misdemeanors and went to switzerland with her apparently rich parents.  

Fast forward to a year later and she is trying to clean up her online image and her mother has been harassing any webhost that even mentions the story or her name in a negative light (one of the sites resides on my server and she called the abuse department for our host more than 30 times in a single day, etc and wouldn't stop badgering them until we were forced to take the forum private).  All of the facebook pages to bring attention were shut down, all of the sites mentioning what she had done were taken down and only a few news sites remain.  His offspring (I assume son) posted about it a year ago here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/nnid4/please_help_spread_the_word_about_a_swiss_golfer/

You can get her name from this article (I'm not posting it directly here so it doesn't show up in google):

http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_d9a1934f-1614-5dc1-8f93-b4046f412bf7.html

It is my understanding that the family has not received any money from her family at all and the medical bills were immense (apparently the VA doesn't pay medical real well either

This is some of the personal account from the gentleman who was hit:

*I was hit on the left side of my bike. I remember seeing the car coming at me

* From the ground up
* Broken ankle
* large gash in my knee cap
* broken ribs
* broken pinky finger (required surgery)
* puncture wound to my wrist
* strained muscles in my shoulder
* injury to my jaw causing severe TMJ
* Broken nose
* broken facial bones between my eyes and mouth
* Damaged optic nerve
* gash on my head
* Traumatic brain injury

*At one time

*Currently, the ankle hurts when the weather changes, I've lost 75% of the peripheral vision on my left side and my memory and concentration aren't so good.*

*After she hit me, her response was ""Oh, he'll be alright, I'm worried about my scholarship"".*

Thanks in advance Rideit! 

Please don't post her name in this thread at all

EDIT:  Thanks for all the responses and exposure thusfar.  If you want a real clue into how she handled this situation

EDIT 2:  To save you some time

* 6 out of 6 intoxicated clues observed
* She asked to speak to her father who was an attorney, when the officer said that she had just had the conversation she said she hadn't talked to anyone and denied talking on the phone (despite being observed talking on the phone), got father on the phone, he said he was NOT an attorney.
*  Officer observed her 'I don't care attitude'
*  Officer quoted her saying ""Well
*  Answered 'Yes' and 'Sure' to her Miranda rights
*  Denied she had any alcohol

EDIT 3:  It should also be mentioned that the point of this post and our general campaign isn't about money at all

So I was riding along on my way home from work. My commute is mostly two-lane rural highway that connects two satellite cities outside of Nashville, hey, they're probably driving down this road for the first time, it's a twisty road, I can understand going slow. But after a while I see that their speed is fluctuating like crazy, from the aforementioned 40 to 60 then back to 40, over the course of maybe two miles. The driver would also swerve occasionally, I'm figuring there's a good chance it's a drunk driver; regardless

Well, and I react by falling back a bit, he gets back in his lane, and I kick it down a gear and get ready to fly by this guy before something bad happens.

Well, I'm right beside his window; lo and behold, it's a sub-20 year old kid staring down at his phone. As I'm looking at him, he looks up from his phone and seems a little freaked out that I'm there, and despite all those pre-situation thoughts of shaking my head, motioning for him to put the phone down, whatever

I could tell that the kid sped up once I got past him, and with the kid only about 150 feet behind me, I have to stop. 

So, while I'm keeping my eyes forward, I hear ""Hey, dude. What the fuck, man? What's your deal?"" but I ignore it. I hear ""Hey, faggot, you fucker!"" but I still ignore it. *Come on, now* is all I'm thinking. Then, and he throws a wadded up paper bag or something at me. I don't know what he thought it'd accomplish aside from pissing me off; but it definitely did that.

At that point, but it's what I did, and I was fucking committed to it. 

But luckily, does a U-turn, and is behind the kid with his lights flashing. I'm thinking ""FUCK YES! DREAM COME TRUE."" 

I look back at the cop and wave at him, asks me if I can get over to the side, I say ""yes, can I dismount on the shoulder?"" and the officer says yes, just stay by the bike with the keys out of the ignition. So I do. He walks over to me after asking for the kid's papers or whatever and talking to him for a second, asks if I'm okay, asks if I know the kid, and I tell the officer politely that I'm okay and that no I don't know him, and unless it was just a joke between friends, start it up

I was smiling the whole way home. 

May karma be as instantaneous and satisfying to you as it was to me this evening. Sorry to be so long-winded!

TL;DR: asshole teenager in a cage that I caught playing with his phone throws assorted garbage at me

19 years old, and a car pulled into the left lane without looking and my buddy ended up on the left shoulder. He pinned the throttle and pulled ahead of the driver.

...He was pissed

She ended up running him off the road and spinning the car out on the median grass. His bike was totaled but luckily he walked away from the wreck with no broken bones.

It could have been much worse, and making sure you come home to your family after a ride, and stay out of courts/jail/hospital/morgue.

One last point. Motorcycle police can be our best role model. If they wouldn't carry, and have been in incredibly dangerous situations.

Carry a gun if you want... that's fine, but don't lose your cool. It's not worth your legal record, or your life.

And keep your ceramics and hammers at home... that's just thug bullshit.

He followed close behind me, but you get some kind of connection with someone when this happens, maybe because I don't have any friends who ride, so its a rare opportunity to have a riding brother, but that 15 minutes was probably some of the most enjoyable riding I have done since I started.

We parted ways at a roundabout, and will probably never see him again, but the fact we had 2 wheels in common seemed to be enough of a reason for him to stick with me all that time.

Just thought i'd share that boring story with all my other internet bros.

I called the cops this morning to let them know I was pretty sure that it was my bike. They told me they'd get back to me so I was watching my phone like a hawk.  They called this afternoon and I went with them to identify the bike.  They acted like normal buyers
 
So I eventually looked at the bike confirmed it was mine through some scuffs and parts that I added.

I emergency braked down to about 25mph when I realized I was going to hit so let off the brakes and swerved into the shoulder, missing the mattress by literally inches.

Here is a picture of our dual sports together

The story can be seen here http://www.whittierdailynews.com/crime/ci_20069678

This was at the crash sight last night http://i.imgur.com/Q15mn.jpg

He was a great father, and my best friend. He taught me to be a good person, to ride motorcycles, to fly hang gliders,to conquer my fears, to strive for greatness, to have a different outlook on life, to build anything i could imagine. He was always there for me and i could not ask for a better dad. I'm going to remember him always and I hope justice will be served for his death. 

Thank you for all your support everyone

Edit: I woke up this morning and wanted to ride. Something was telling me that it is what he would of wanted. So i got up, and headed up to the cleveland national forest on my dual sport. My father and I rode up there a lot together, where he taught me so much about riding. There were so many great memories, beautiful memories of us together. As i was riding I could here his voice telling me what a good rider I have become. When I got to the top the clouds were rolling over the top of the mountain and the sun was bright and warm. I wish he could be there with me, but in a way he was.

Your condolences have helped me more than you can believe and helped me to get right back on my motorcycle. Thank you

1364321860.0,1b20dl,Used Motorcycle Buying Guide,BengNY,880,113,195,"So I decided to write this up after checking out yet another POS bike from a seller.  Buying a used bike is a great route for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a new ride.  These are the things I've learned to look for over the years and I hope it helps someone.

**Trust no one.**  I've bought bikes with major undisclosed issues from guys I thought were trustworthy and great no hassle bikes from guys who came off as really sketchy. 

**Never feel pressured** to not go through the list below. Print it off because you will forget things in the moment.  Buying a bike is high stress.  You're excited about the bike

**Dealbreakers**:  Walk away if...
**1**:The title is not in the sellers name.
**2**:The Vin on the engine doesn't match the vin on the frame doesn't match the vin on the title (People below point out that the engine matching may not apply to certain makes).
**3**:The title is a salvage/ rebuild.
**4**:The bike doesn't run.  Trust me
**5**:The bike is warmed up (see below).

**Battery**.  Before doing anything get out your meter and measure the battery voltage.  Should be around 12.5-12.7.

**Cold Start**.  I tell every seller before coming over not to warm it up.  You want to see this baby from dead cold.  You never know what kind of coaxing the seller did right before you arrived.  Verify the headers are cool

**Equal Pressure**.  Not the most important but while the bike is warming up I feel the exhaust and make sure they're about equal.  On one of my older bikes when the sync slips its obvious which one is firing better.

**Engine Noise**.  Listen for valve/ timing chain chatter.  Youtube can give you good examples.  On some bikes a little chatter is normal during warmup but it should go away.  Older hondas have a  louder top end than modern bikes.  A *very general* rule of thumb is the top end should sound like a sewing machine. 

**Revving**.  Once the bike is warm give the throttle a few blips. It should go *quickly* back to idle.  

**Charging System**.  Hook the meter up to the battery.  At idle it should be around 13-14.5v depending on the bike.  Some bikes don't charge until 1.5krpm -2krpm. Rev it to above 3krpm and it should DROP a bit.  The dropping indicates the voltage regulator is working.  It should never charge hotter than 15v. If you don't have a meter do this while watching the headlight.  The light should have the same brightness throughout the whole test.  

**Brakes**.  Check disc brakes by looking at the wear indicator on the pad

**Clutch**. Ease of pull is pretty important if you don't want a sore left hand after 10 minutes.  During the test ride the bike should quickly engage when you let out the clutch; if it hangs for a bit thats a bad sign.  Get into a higher gear and open the throttle wide to stress the clutch a bit

**Forks**.  Hold the front brake and depress the forks.  If you can depress them all the way just with your body they're dead.  Look for oil residue on the forks after you depress them.  This would indicate a bad fork seal.

**Tires**. Kicking them is a great way to look naive.  Look for dry rot on the sidewalls or in the treads.  Treads should pass the penny test

**Fuel tank**.  Open up the fuel tank and look for visible rust.   A flashlight is handy for this.  Small rust spots are fairly normal in older bikes.  Rust spots bigger than a pencil eraser

**Chain/ Belt**. Check chain or belt for vertical travel in the drive and return  section.  Should be about 1 inch in the middle section.  Pull a few links off the rear sprocket, the chain/belt is stretched to the end of its life.  For the belt look for cracks although I don't know what the tolerance is for a cracking belt.  Shaft drives are fairly maintenance free, just make sure they turn freely.  

**Sprocket**.  Look for worn teeth.  In very general terms they'll be asymmetric

**Electrical**.  Straightforward.  Hit all the buttons and brake levers and they should do their job.

**Test Ride**.  If you make it this far you should be ready to buy because some sellers ask for the cash in hand to take a ride.  Don't buy a bike without riding it, ergonomics and performance.  

The above

Please add anything I missed or your own experiences!

**tl;dr:** If you're thinking of buying a used bike read above.

**Edit/Afterward**: Some very valid points brought up in the comments! 

[Tirecodes](http://www.barrystiretech.com/dotcoding.html) May come in handy!

Be Considerate! Sellers are generally good people its too bad a few bad ones means you have to watch out.  The bike is still *his property* so you should ask before doing any of the above.  If he doesn't want you unscrewing a bolt or something

This guide is aimed at inexperienced buyers looking for a reliable ride, etc are all good if that's what you're looking for.  

Regarding the vin/engine number matching this may not apply to your bike.

1367988078.0,1dwww3,First day out - got arrested.,megasmash,720,84,283,"Well

I woke up early this morning to transfer ownership and get a plate for my '78 Honda Cb400T. Everything went well, and suited up to go to the gym. My inaugural gym ride went well, bike ran perfect. Worked out, suited up, and got on the bike to go home and eat lunch.

About 5mins away from the gym, so I decide to walk the bike home and enjoy the weather, plus, the majority of it is downhill. About 20 mins into the walk, I pass a hospital. Now, I'm walking my disabled motorcycle on a bike/walking trail. I took my gear off because it's hot, and I'm starting to sweat.

I pass a cop car

""STOP STOP STOP!""

I look around to see who is yelling - I thought someone passing by on the street yelled, and my brand new helmet. Two male officers throw me on the ground, rip my shirt off in the process, put the boots to my back and legs, and cuff me.

I'm fucking stunned beyond belief. I'm exhausted from the gym, and I'm cuffed, face down on the pavement. In the time this happened, I don't know if my bike made it onto the stand, I don't know if my helmet fell off, I really have no idea what's just happened.

After a few minutes

""My ID is in my jacket pocket

I think I repeated that about 15 times before they started to listen.

They run my ID

An officer explains to me that I ""matched the description"" of someone they were looking for - someone on a ""Black crotch rocket"" that was stolen ran away from cops - I was wearing a bright red shirt

They ask me ""Do you understand what just happened?""

No I don't. Why was I taken down and roughed up instead of asked to produce ID? Why was the female officer reaching for her gun

I'm pretty pissed off at this point, they uncuff me, and I get to leave.

""Don't I at least get a sorry?""

Ha. Boy was I wrong. ""What should we be sorry for - we're just doing our job."" Is what I got.

So here I am

A few minutes later

""No thanks man

""It's ok. I'm a biker too

The tow truck driver was really helpful. He strapped my bike down, Tow Truck Drivers = scum""... boy has my opinion changed.

When I got home

What would have happened had I been riding my bike on the road at the time? Would they have acted even more aggressively?

Is that the extent of their description that they act on? ""Man with a motorbike.""

Whatever happened to being asked to produce ID?

I didn't run. I didn't reach for a weapon . I didn't even hear anything other than ""STOP STOP STOP"". I'm walking down a busy sidewalk, half naked on the side of the road.

The more I think about it

Anyways, and went out for a ride tonight... where I ran out of gas.

It's bedtime for this guy - I've had a long day.

Here's a pic of me and my Honda the tow truck driver snapped. Less than 24h with this bike and I've already got a hell of a story to tell - it's gonna be a good relationship. [At least I'm smiling.](http://imgur.com/Wyx7atk)

PS: If anyone lives near Rachel's Roadhouse in Mercer PA

**update - 80/05/2013** I've contacted a lawyer and am awaiting a visit to my doctor. Had a hard time sleeping last night, the more it irks me. It's not so much the fact that I'm out a t-shirt, and possibly a helmet. It's how I was (mis)treated. I've been ""spot checked"" before for simply walking down the street. They ask me for ID and ask me a few questions. I've got no issue with that - that's a cop doing the job of a cop. Tackling someone and roughing them up simply because they fit the vague description of a wanted person is a cop being a thug.

We chat for a few moments and he tells me he's there with his 17 yr old helping him getting his motorcycle license. We shoot the shit while our paperwork is being processed and I learn that his son is super green when it comes to riding and he just bought him a 2013 Ninja 300.

I scribble down on a post it note my name and phone number and offer to take his son on a few rides down the local twisty spot (Hwy 9 in Los Gatos

A few seconds later the clerk prompts me to pay the $36 for registration and I present my credit card. He runs it and asks me to put in my pin and I respond with saying that it's a credit card. He says, so I'm shit outta luck. The clerk hands me my paperwork back and it's 445 so they're closing in 15 mins. Thus me coming back after a quick trip to the bank then bypassing the line that day isn't an option. I just realized that I flushed an hour + at the DMV and Ill have to come back and repeat everything tomorrow.

The father I'd been conversing with steps in and say's ""Let me take care of that for you."" Hands the clerk his debit card

I was just trying to do the right thing by a 17 yr old kid hungry to get a taste of life on 2 wheels. Within seconds of watching his back.... the karma was bestowed upon me. I'll post again after we go on our first ride together but thought this was a story between riders

It's a restaurant parking lot and there are plenty of people milling about. Happy families with wide-eyed kids ogling the spaceman on a motorcycle.

I feel rested, but I'm smooth mr spaceman Steve on his shiny motorcycle, so I just throw a leg over.

It should be noted

I immediately discover that just throwing a leg over was a mistake. The bike leans a little too much for comfort, but this pushes the bike further down. I feel the mass of the bike as it crosses that threshold between mostly staying vertical and mostly staying horizontal. 

I shifted my leg and braced myself as I gripped the handlebars. I was not dropping this fucking bike while those kids were watching me with their goddamned eyes. Every ounce of strength went into pulling against the mass of that bike

With a great heave, and I was vidicated. The spectators did not see a man drop a motorcycle at a complete stop today, nosiree. They saw a man wrestle a rebellious machine into obedience. They saw a man in complete control of the world around him.

I'm sure a lot of you reading this have suffered from, buying groceries is done at the quietest times, people stopping me to ask for directions wonder why I mumble out a ""I'm sorry"" before I hurriedly run off. Quite frankly, my life is torture. People say things such as ""go to the Doctor and get some medication"", but it's not as simple as that for me when I can't even man up and go to the doctors. The only reason I got diagnosed at age 16 was because my parents dragged me (quite literally) to see the school counselor over concerns with my poor grades.

Having social anxiety ruins any chance I have with making friends

When I was 18 I was involved in a car crash (I was at fault) and now suffer from a constant dull back pain that I have to take medication for and lately my mother's health has been deteriorating and I really worry she might not be around for much longer.

For a number of years now I've always wanted to go and get my bike license but have always put it off for one reason or another (nearly all related to my anxiety). But a few months ago I booked myself in for the Pre-learners course (a bit like your MSF courses) here in Sydney. I nearly didn't get out of bed. But I did. I nearly didn't get out of the car. But I did. I walked into the classroom and sat down quietly jumping for joy that I had got all that way without backing out.

Unfortunately I had turned up on the wrong day and was in fact scheduled for the following month. That's embarrassing for anyone but for someone like me I spiraled into depression; How could I have been so stupid to not read the date on the email correctly?

The next time was a quadrillion times harder. What if the trainer remembers me and brings it up to the new class? I didn't think I could cope. But I did. The other people in the group all had some experience with bikes from riding dirt bikes on a farm to needing to re-sit the Pre-Learners because their L's had expired. I had no experience and was by far the most greenhorn out of the lot. My anxiety rose again and I suddenly thought of an escape route. Perhaps I could pretend to get a phone call and say I have to shoot off? But I didn't.

I got on the bike for the first time and suddenly everything wrong with my life went away

After passing the course I went on the hunt for my own bike and eventually found a bike that I wanted. I had to bring my Father along with me to the dealership as I couldn't face the salesman on my own. I became the proud owner of a CBR250.

Since then I have ridden nearly every day; nothing major

For those few minutes each day everything I stress and worry about is gone. I no longer worry about falling into suicidal thoughts

I needed to get this off my chest as my depression took a bit of a downward spiral today and I just wanted to share with the world that getting my bike license may have possibly saved my life.

Your bike can do things 4 times faster than the cars around you...but your reflexes aren't always 4 times greater

That car ahead of you doing 80 mph? Sure you can follow 8 feet back and still stop in time....but what about the car behind YOU that's ALSO going 80 mph? Your following distance ahead of you should account for your stopping space *and the distance required for the guy behind you to get their head out of their ass and get slowed down too*.

I find while commuting, and I don't do a whole lot of lane changes (commuters are a predictable bunch, I should be predictable, too.)

I hear lots of 'I nearly got squished by a fuckin' cager with their nose in ther cellphone and their head up their ass' and I think ""If you know they're like that

Yeah, there's no space! Well, make some then. Slow down a bit. If someone darts into the space you make...make some more. Save the heroics for the weekends in much more deserted parts of the landscape.

So I was at a stop light on a 55 MPH limit highway, the SUV that was next to me at the light shot past me going at least 80.  When I got to the next light it was red, and the SUV is stopped in the other lane.  

I come to a stop next to it and the woman driving puts her window down and this happens...

Her: YOU CAN'T DRIVE SO FAST!!!

Me: ...what?

Her: You were speeding so much!  Slow down or I'm calling the cops!

Me: But... I... You were going faster than me.

Her: NO! You just took off after the light changed!

Me: I mean... I accelerated faster

Her: YOU WERE JUST GOING TOO FAST!

Me: If you passed me you have to have been going faster.  I don't have time to explain to you how physics works.

She shouted something about me not listening to her and I just closed my visor and the light changed

* I sing 

* I bob my head when I'm singing
* I wave at strangers just to confuse them 
* I scratch my helmet in traffic to confuse people 
* I narrate my journey
* When it's raining heavily I'll often amuse people in town by pretending to shower (Scrubbing under my pits and washing my hair)
* If the roads clear I will often pretend to pedal my motorcycle when passing cyclists
* I push my indicator cancel button and pretend to fire missiles at people 
* I swing my legs about when the roads are slow and open 
* I'll rev my engine at red lights when I'm next to someone who's easily challenged then launch sedately and watch them bolt off braking suddenly because they’re embarrassed 
* Very rarely if I have time to kill I’ll ask for directions then as someone talking I’ll shoot off… 

(That last one is sort of a dickish move but I rarely do it)

I'll generally have fun on my bike. 

Sometimes it's a bit strange and I'll admit I have been known for not being particularly normal amongst friends and family but I'm always safe on the roads and playing around puts a smile on my face.

**So what do you guys do for fun when you're riding?**

1365181996.0,1bqstg,After seeing that hour long video of wrecks I have a few pointers for riders old and new alike.,Kwiatkowski,463,78,156,"Hey guys

1.  If you are riding around traffic cover your controls and be extra cautious!  The more cars around you the higher the chance that one will try to hit you.  

2.  Practice emergency handling in a safe environment.  I have seen many many videos of people going down because of locked wheels or going off a turn while braking, have the friend vary timing greatly to keep you on your toes.  For breaking mid turn draw a large circle in the lot with chalk and a string or with whatever you can, the point here is a decent size circle that you can clearly follow.  Follow the circle starting at low speed and break to a stop while staying as close to the line as possible.  Each time you are able to complete the course without too much trouble increase your speed by a few MPH.  This will get hard very fast once you build some lean, but you will learn at what lean angle you can comfortably stop without losing your lane.  Once you learn that angle make that the farthest that you will go when you may have to stop (traffic, blind corners, night, rain

3. Don't race on the road!  It isn't worth it.  EVER.  It costs much less than a ticker, or hospital bills to just do a track day form time to time.  

4.  If you are going to practice tricks by all means do so

5.  Going to push it in the twisties?  Is there a chance that you'll lowside?  Get frame sliders front and back if needed.  you will probably go down at some point and these may save your bike from most damage and maybe all of it.  

6.  Slick and sticky sport bike tires are great for dry grip

7.  ATGATT

8.  Don't ride near or past your limit.  There will be a time on a road that's beyond fun that you push it too far.  Your bike may be able to handle it but that doesn't mean you can (see asgeorge for clarity).  

9.  Keep your bike well maintained and in good riding health.  Make a quick checklist and go over it before a ride.  Things to check:  Oil, suspension, battery.  All of these can be checked in under a minute with a quick walk around.  

10.  Ride often!  The more miles the more you will learn. and the better you will get.  

11.  A bike may be the stuff of your dreams

12. Any blind corner can instantly become a death trap!  Be extremely cautious around them. (Thanks Konwayz!)

13. Road debris travels in groups. If you see one piece cover your controls and be prepared because chances are there are more coming up ahead. (thanks Jaque8!)
