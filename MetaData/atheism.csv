some extra info:

Friday
Pay attention to the date

A 27 year old owner of a Facebook novelty account has been arrested by Greek Authorities. The charge?

Blasphemy.

As the official police announcement states in more detail, the Electronic Crimes Unit received thousands of digital petitions, coming from denizens from across the world.

The creator of the Facebook group GERONTAS PASTITSIOS/ELDER PASTITSIOS, concerning the satirical Facebook Group GERONTAS PASTITSIOS/ELDER PASTITSIOS, claiming that ""this user is using hubris, irony and is attempting to ridicule this Holy person of Greek Orthodoxy Elder Paisios (the monk, whose supposed modern day miracles are being satirized by the Facebook page in question). Shining examples of such Hubris are posts like 'Elder Pastitsios the Patsafarian (sic)', 'The New Miracle from the Elder in Serres', as well as numerous taunting and indecent photographs""

""The Miracle Of The Elder At Serres"" was a bogus article created by the author of the Facebook group GERONTAS PASTITSIOS
It described a supposed miracle that happened at the Greek Region of Serres: In short, and on the same night she dreamed of the Elder Paisios, who told her that her son would be well and good and that she should not grieve any more for her prayers were heard and answered. The mother returned to the hospital the next day, to a completely stunned group of doctors who informed her that not only had her son woken up without the smallest injury, but that all traces of drugs had disappeared from his body. The mother and son left the hospital on foot, and the son has been praying to God ever since, never touching any drugs again.

**Edit 3:** Thanks a lot for showing all the love. I got really nice support from many of you guys and thanks for your suggestions on how to do really make it happen. I posted a help cry on my local [sub-reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/nfldh/tcs_i_accepted_a_challenge_to_plant_one_tree_per/) and people are really coming forward to help with this. I got around 40 people who are willing to give me a hand with the labor work. I will be also contacting local non-profits and national parks around town to get more support from them. Also one redditor is trying to get me in touch with one large firm in town, please plant one tree around you. I can post your pictures along with others in a future post if you PM me the link.

The cook mentioned that while he didn't have any ill feelings toward ""the gays""

It was pretty slow in the restaurant

I mentioned that the verse he was referring to was Leviticus 18:22 ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind as if with womankind: it is an abomination.""  He nodded emphatically

I then pointed out that in the very same book
and James 2:10 ""For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.""

I explained my point that according to scripture it is just as bad to wear clothes of mixed fabric as it is to be homosexual.  I asked him why he thought that we put so much emphasis on the gay thing but not the mixed fabric thing.  I posited that it was much more likely that both of these things are meaningless and harmless and that our society likes to pay more attention to the gay verse because it suits our political and social ends but that we all treat other parts (like the fabrics verse) as obvious silliness that we don't need to pay attention to anymore.

Here's the part where he blew my mind.  Any one of us who has debated any point with a fundamentalist knows that logic and reference to scriptural contradictions and fallacy are almost always completely ineffectual.  You never get anywhere debating a christian.
I was expecting more of the same from this guy but after I laid it out like that he kind of just stood there with his head tilted, I never knew any of that stuff.  You've got a real good point.  I guess not everything in the bible is really worth taking seriously and I can't think of a good reason to pick and choose between them.  I reckon gay people have just as much right to be gay as I do in choosing what I wear.""*

I decided not to get into the difference between fashion choices and being born gay.  That's the first time something like that has ever happened to me.  I really couldn't believe it.

We have many different religions

What I have learned is that Islam is not a religion like any other. Let me explain: Most religions and most cultures are compatible with Belgian culture and law, economic system, justice, education, culture and religion.

When Muslims come to Europe to live their lives

We have Police here who's job is to make sure that the citizens follow the law. People with Islamic roots are showing some kind of immunity against the police. They show this in how they behave towards the police, is the only authority.

Every week there are cases of violence against police and it always shows the same pattern: 1 Muslim gets arrested, this is the reality here today in 2012.

Then there is education. We have Belgian laws which guarantee a minimum level of education. It's a book full of facts that must be taught in every school

I personally know a teacher who had the task to teach evolution to her pupils. The children with an Islamic background, you are just a dumb woman, my parents tell us that we should not listen to you about this evolution crap, Allah has created us and all the animals."" They are ordered by their parents to not do any homework on the theory of evolution and they deliberately fail the tests. This problem is not limited to pupils. There are 20-year olds studying to become teachers, who also deny evolution. There are various reports of Islamic teachers who got their job as a teacher, and they are teaching creationism to Islamic children, denying evolution


They not only deny the authority of the police


Then there is the problem of food. Islam does not accept pork as ""clean"" food. Therefore, I am talking about the everyday Muslim.

Now economy. Belgium has banks, Saudi-Arabia etc... because those banks follow certain Islamic rules. They are constantly draining and transferring money out of Europe. They do not accept our banking system because it's not compliant with the Islamic view of economy.

I know I'm writing a long text here

Justice.

The number of hate crimes against homosexuals is increasing every year. It started a few years back with taunting and attacking homosexual persons around areas with gay bars. Since last year, just hate crimes, hate against gays. The gay community is aware of areas in Belgium where they are no longer safe simply because they are gay. This wasn't the case 10 years ago. Then there are the increasing reports of honor killings. Just recently, a 22 year old Belgian bared the child of her 19 year old Islamic ex-boyfriend. The family of this Muslim had arranged a wife and a marriage for him, and this child would bring a shame on the whole family. That's why he and his nephew have killed this young 22 year old girl, to save the honor of the family.



I hope I'm getting my point across here. Although Islam is being defined as a religion, it's a culture, it's an entire social system.


And it's impacting with another system. It's not impacting with Christianity

Let me stress out that Muslims are more attached to their Islamic system, than the European people who just have the government as the authority. Muslims are therefore not showing as much indulgence as other Europeans, resulting in an increasing amount of rights for Muslims and a decreasing amount of rights for Europeans.


Other cultures and religions have had no problem with fitting in. But Islam is not just a religion. It's something different.

This was not the case. My mother and sister immediately jumped up and yelled at me about how I was going to hell. They then ran off and hugged each other hysterically while crying.

I then called the police because I was scared that someone was trying to hurt me. My family lied to the cops and they believed them. As the cops were leaving my mother assaulted me while tryig to take my phone. The cops didn't care about that either. I have been kicked out of their house.

offering a place to say. 

EDIT 3: I do not have a car so I have to wait to go get my daughter until my ride is here. Also

I've got a pole barn sized garage and because I live on a corner it's only a few feet from the fence line and gates, I was impressed and thankful to them for respecting my opinions. 

We talked about the city

Just felt like sharing, right and boundaries.

TL:DR Had a surreal and great experience with door to door pamphlet pushers were the discussion about religion ended in seconds and talks about fruit pies and pets lasted an hour while I relaxed with strangers in the barn. Mutual respect is possible between those who believe and those who don't or don't follow model religion.

I'll try to make this as short as possible. For the past 11 years, but to a more than just good paying position. 

I worked a sales position for a fairly large company, even though I was too busy to actually use it. 

Fast forward to a little less than a year ago. I was requested to drop everything during a sales integration project and head back to corp HQ. Thinking that I was about to close this project

It was a Tuesday morning. Upon arriving to the office, [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), misc atheism blogs etc etc. Basically anything atheistic was highlighted and notated. 

I was informed that ""several"" of my fellow employees, there was no severance. 

I spoke with a close lawyer friend back where I lived (Los Angeles) and ended up discussing my situation with all of the partners in his law firm. They thankfully took my discrimination and wrongful termination case. 

Turns out that one of my co-works who I was friends with on Facebook discovered my religious status as ""Atheist"" on facebook and started spreading the word. At some point (probably when my LCD died) IT installed ""SpectorSoft"" on my laptop which supposedly took screenshots based on keywords or specific times

My then ex-company tried to settle outside of court. Most likely because they realized they uber-fucked up. They tried to play it off as my co-workers not feeling ""safe"" around me. I refused to settle and began burning up my savings on lawyer and court fees. 11 months later, conference calls, recordings, etc. The court ruled in favor of me. I will be compensated very nicely and all my lawyer fees will be paid for by my ex company. Just in the nick of time for my birthday tomorrow. 

I still accidentally have the laptop they gave me last year. Not out of spite

Cheers to you /r/atheism. Unfortunately there's a decent amount of arrogance here

As for my future

TL;DR - Fired for being an atheist and making my bible belt coworkers ""afraid"" of me. After almost a year of legal mumbo jumbo

There is a deeply evangelical christian family that lives in our little neighborhood. They are just angry, the wife/mother in this family got really sick and one of her kidneys failed. I'd say she's in her mid-30's or so. The remaining kidney was damaged and is literally running on borrowed time. She's doing twice daily dialysis and needs a new kidney very soon. The local HOA caught wind of the story and posted a little write up in the community newsletter about their situation. Since they are literally assholes to everyone around them, I figured it would go unnoticed altogether.

To my surprise, surgery was scheduled and everything was looking great. This guy was a local hero.

To celebrate, and that he was donating a kidney to help out another human being (that he had never met) and did not want any praise or recognition of any kind.

The (dying) wife/mother went completely apeshit. She had let an atheist into their house

The following day, no nothing. When he shockingly asked why they were refusing, he was told ""She doesn't want the blood of an atheist inside her body. She'd rather die first"".

An ambulance showed up at her house a few days ago (hence what started this conversation with my neighbor in the first place) and hauled her off to the ICU. She needs an emergency kidney donation immediately or she will most likely not survive. She still refuses an atheist's kidney.

richard.clogg@iowacourts.gov

Prosecuting attorney: Brian Tingle

The Story:
Police in Indianola, but here is an article on it:

http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/06/27/indianola-police-charge-16-year-old-with-murder/

In short

The judge in the case disagreed with the prosecutor and ruled that it was not first degree murder. He also ruled that Nadler would not be charged as an adult.  For whatever reason, or Christian. This means the worst that Nadler is facing is juvenile detention until he is 18 years old. Even that is questionable at this point.

The mother is pleading for justice: [link](http://www.whotv.com/news/who-story-doyle-family-shooting-100810

From the comments section of that story:

That was brother. That was my big brother the one that was supposed to walk me down the aisle when it came my time to get married. The one who was my protector when I needed him. The one my 11 year old little brother was supposed to go to when he had girl problems or needed someone to talk to.

And now what? His life was taken over another child’s stupidity. My brother is dead because another child decided to be a cold-blooded murderer. He shows no remorse whatsoever for he has done. And I have been to every single court date we have had. I got to read the police report. I got to read the judge’s decision. 

There is SO much that you people along with the rest of them that you guys won't know and never will know. I think you all need to stop and think about what you’re basing your ""facts"" on. You haven't seen or read or even heard the things I have. So you need to stop and think before you going running your mouths about something you have absolutely no clue about. 

The judge said ""it wouldn't be in the communities best interest"" to put Dan in prison. Well that's bull crap. His decision was a career based move and that’s all it was. And you know what Judge Clogg has dealt with Daniels father before. And I don't find it to be fair that a Judge who has had Dan’s father in court before gets to make a decision like this regarding his son. 

How do we know that Ernest Nadler and Judge Clogg aren't the best of friends? What if they were and that’s what he's basing his decision on? There is no justice being done for my brother in this case. And it's wrong. I sat in court and saw the picture of my brother. Him lying there with blood on him. Him dead. How would you guys feel if that were your brother? Or your son or nephew? You wouldn't like it and you would be doing the same things my family is. You'd be trying to get him justice because you know he deserves it. 

My brother wanted to be a lawyer. He would have been a damn good one too. But no Daniel Nadler took all that away from him. He DECIDED James’s fate. And he decided his fate was to die right then and there. 

Daniel's family still gets their birthdays and Christmases with their son. We have to go watch my brothers YouTube videos just to hear his voice again. They make a simple phone call and get to hear his. If there was a way we could call my brother in Heaven then we would

So stop and think about how you would honestly feel if that would have been your son or daughter. Or even YOU. You'd be feeling and doing the same things we are. And Daniels father and family could be heard. They could be telling their side on the news or to all of you. But they don't and that’s not our fault. So take a step back and think before you start judging my family. And saying things you have no clue about. Just think for a minute.

A group of Iranian youth arranged an Ancient Iranian festival called *Ab-bazi* wherein people celebrate the sanctity of water by splashing it at each other. The festival was contacted through Facebook, showed up in a park near the outskirts of Karaj, Alborz to have fun playing with water.

The Police force of Islamic Republic showed up, they arrested fifty people for 'offending norm of the Islamic society'.

This also happened last years

However the punishment is, specially by Western people who view Iranian people in the same kin as their government and discriminate them based on their false dichotomy.

You would have thought I spit in eye slit of his mom's niqāb. Dude lost his shit and started screaming at me that I should know that alcohol has never passed his lips because he is a devout Muslim. I almost just got up and walked out (I'm your doctor

However I looked him straight in the eye and said ""I don't look at the color or your skin or your accent or where you are from and make assumptions about you. That goes for being a Muslim

Dude stopped short and apologized. When I go in later to go over his results with him he says how he was thinking that he was making assumptions about how Christians in America think about Muslims and that's what made him so upset. Now I am not super out as an atheist at work

Me: *Actually I'm not a Christian.*

Him: You're a Jew?

Me: *No

Him: (blink. blink. pause. laugh.) Ah

Me: (Nodding and pointing to my badge with a small red A pin and a rainbow caduceus) *Both

Him: (At this point I can almost see the cogs turning and shit shorting out in his brain. He's half freaked out but still in that introspective space about his religion and assumptions) Well maybe that's why you do not make assumptions about me. I think many people make assumptions about you.

Cost me $107 to register. Anything over that i will donate to Doctors Without Borders since that seems to be a great organization r/atheism loves.

edit:
What if we used it to sell pixels and make a million dollars like ""The Million Dollar Homepage"" did? Sell pixels in for $1 in 10x10 blocks to porn websites. :) I know DWB would love a cool mil :)

My Response: I can hate the beliefs but not the believer; so I hope you would hate the sins but not the sinner...  It doesn't mean that we don't agree at one aspect in life


Dad: Even satan acknowledges the existence of God. but then you do not believe in Satan. That is the greatest HELL you will be - LIMBO. No meaning, that is because your heart is clouded by your reading. You are right religion will not save... but not believing in God will damn your soul. My goodness. Whatever you have been through, do not shut Him out. Love emanates from Him. It is you who allowed your belief to get in the way. Your ways, your ill-manners and disrespect for your parents are manifests of the presence of the devil in your life. We have been praying for you, every day without miss. You are under grace because of our love and prayer, but God have mercy on your soul. You are blinded because you want to be liberated. We have to part ways. And I will pray doubly hard that you will find your way back. Go enjoy your empty life.


My Response: That's an illogical jump of conclusion. Very stereotypical and generalized. It takes a person with an open mind to comprehend atheism. Bill Gates was an atheist but was a good charitable man. So your statement is invalid and completely null. Sagan, then such conditional love must your god have instilled in you then. I would not take parenting advice from that god at all.


My friend's opinion: So you're a nurse, you are obviously someone who cares a great deal about people... and your Dad has a problem with you because you're an atheist??? There's plenty of friends with you in your pics, plenty of different places you've been to, plenty of hobbies and interests you have, you love life, and people, and new experiences.
He should be proud.


BACKGROUND:
I'm a 24-year-old Filipino nurse who's now working in another country. Whole family is back in Philippines and communicate with them through e-mail.

Raised as a Catholic and has always attended Catholic schools together with my siblings.

My dad just blocked me after this e-mail conversation and told me to cut communication with the entire family. Right now

But the brighter side of everything is that I am lucky to be working and living independently and have come to the enlightenment which gave me a better appreciation in this one life that I have and I will not waste it away with some spiritual fantasy.",self,t5_2qh2p,1357671265.0,quality,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/14e5gw/my_family_hasnt_talked_to_me_for_a_couple_of/
