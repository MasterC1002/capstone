Can someone explain to me why it is wrong to *ever* celebrate death? Some people's lives, their death improves the world. If an event improves the world, why can't I celebrate it? I don't think that answers invoking ""respect"" or ""dignity"" can really be consistent, because if anyone is deserving of those surely it must be people who are still alive? They will surely benefit more than someone who is dead, yet paradoxically death seems to call for an *increasing* amount of respect. And if it is respect for their loved ones (a better answer I think), then why do we not show similar respect when people are put in prison, for example? Or when a despot is removed from power their family will suffer hugely, but we can recognise that while still celebrating the change? More generally

I think most of us would, Stalin, Pinochet, Franco, your_fav_dictactor_here? Is there a point at which someone's evil outdoes the badness of celebrating their death? If this is the case, then why have so many critics started with ""Whatever you think of her politics...""?

Every job position usually comes with certain tasks that need to be fulfilled in a day in order for you to keep your job. 

**Example:**
Let's say that on average *Human1* completes all 8 of his tasks to the best of his ability in 6 hours of work. *Human2* completes the same tasks

Wouldn't a ""per task"" based system benefit everyone more?

Task times could be estimated to an average

I do foresee problems with what *Human2* could do after his completion of work but recently I went to a car mechanic and noticed that in his garage he had a large whiteboard with all symptoms and problems of the broken cars parked outside in a **very organised** manner and every mechanic(he employed about 3) went on their own mission to fix as many things as possible and move as many cars in and out of that garage during the day. 

What I am trying to get at is; one could employ a ""Company Task Pool"" with all kinds of random things thrown in there and if you are done with your tasks you can start working on those and earn extra income. And if there are no tasks to fulfil why keep the employees at work longer than they need to? Let them go home to families sooner

But there is a value that is amiss for me and which is bothersome: discourse.

By discourse I mean a style of arguing which is highly cooperative, the way games of American football or rugby are.

I guess ""discourse"" is like a social science and humanities thing (which could explain its absence in Reddit culture where the hard sciences prevail) but I think it should be a popular thing to value everywhere.  Discourse is cool.

For a community to value discourse, and that we should have pretense for practicing discourse and learning the relevant skills, even if we don't always do it well.

I get frustrated when I try to engage with a fellow Redditor on these terms.  They're usually quick to drop ad hominems and get all huffy.

So my question is

Is it in the nature of discourse not to be accessible to more mainstream audiences?  That doesn't seem right to me.  Just because people on the bell curve aren't going to be 100% deft at discourse doesn't mean that it isn't a good pretense for people to strive for.

I am not asking this question on a macro level but rather on a personal one. Public opinion may not be easily swayed but most rational and moral people consider undue harm a moral indiscretion. Harm is certainly done to animals and even those raised in a manner that is ""benevolent"" such as free range farming still end up being killed unnaturally.

I should state that I am a meat eater and I expect I shall continue to do so but ever since I have thought on this topic I have considered myself something of a hypocrite. I am not seeking validation

I briefly toyed with the idea that farming produces way more animals than would occur naturally and as [I believe] there is no afterlife all experiences are positively gained over nothingness therefore the institution of farming causes more utility gained for the animals than non existence would have. It is not that they owe us their lives it is simply that there is a consumer and producer surplus (both parties gain from farming) that would not exist without such a system in place. But I dismissed this as it is more of an argument in favor of breeding than eating meat.

I have noticed two growing trends in the media and American culture that seem to completely contradict themselves. 

TREND 1: There has been a huge backlash against extremely thin models
 
-examples: the dove campaign for showing ""real women, and the increasing number of sites showing before and after photos of celebrities being photoshopped.

TREND 2: Americans are overweight. We are fat, we don't exercise enough. People should be eating a plant based diet. People are trying juicing. People should try to be healthy. Diabetes and heart disease rates are skyrocketing. Childhood obesity is an epidemic. 

-examples: Michelle Obama introduced her program to get kids exercising. There is a new food pyramid. There is a new meal guide called ""MyPlate"" showing what a truly well balanced meal should be. There are commercials telling you to ""move"" for ten minutes


Does anyone else see the contradiction here? I understand that people, it seems as if every single day, american women are being told that their diet needs to change, while at the same time being told that being skinny is ""bad"" and that they should love themselves the way they are.

* I understand that attraction towards pre-pubescent minors is considered unnatural, there is often no difference between a 15 year old and a 20 year old. Which leads me to my second point --

**3. Psychological underdevelopment**

What would a ""pantheist church"" do? For the sake of my thought experiment I'd expect a couple of key areas:

* Developing that reverence and understanding of nature - think Carl Sagan
* Personal development - Not sure what this would look like but something to develop 'soft skills' would replace the idea of spiritual development (though might be branded as such)
* Community development - both fostering the sense of community and focusing on giving back. Something the church does today

I see the same themes arising in every thread however, St. Vincents, as a reputable charity that will help people at the local level. People will then reply and say things like ""yes, but this charity does not support homosexuality, or gay marriage etc, so do not donate to them"". Logically religious affiliated charities are not going to support gay rights, but even if this philosophical stance by the charities does not effect anything, and resultantly feel it is not fit for receiving a donation.

So my question becomes, then this should factor into determining donations etc? Or as I said in the title of this question, should a charity have to not offend a single person in order to be deemed charitable?

3. What criteria should we use in society to determine if it's time for these laws to be changed? What signs in society should we look for?
4. Do you think there are anti-discrimination or protective laws in place today that should be altered or removed?

It also happens to be one of the chief reasons why we can't have nice things.

Think of the Milgram experiment and how subjects were so eager to affiliate with high status scientists that they were willing to zap an innocent stranger into unconsciousness. Think of the hundreds of millions of people exhausting themselves and wasting resources just so they can have more expensive stuff than the Joneses. From the small evils of everyday life, or insufferable bosses, to the great evils of humanity such as war and totalitarianism, everything boils down to status one way or the other. (Of course, a behavioural economist would argue that it's also one of the great engines of productivity, but I really don't think the positive externalities are worth the negative ones, or that there is no other way to obtain them.)

Status-seeking is probably the single largest component of the notorious ""human nature"" that utopians are always said to fail to account for. This says a lot about what we're missing out on because of this pesky trait.

So. My objective is to improve the social landscape by not perpetuating the status-seeking behaviors that so often make human existence needlessly nasty and competitive

 * Is it really possible for a human to attempt to identify, submission to others, affiliation with high-status people, inclination to make choices primarily for status reasons etc.)?
 * Since people are programmed not to be conscious of their own status-seeking, does one have any hopes of correctly identifying all of one's own status-seeking behaviors?
 * Is status-seeking a game which you lose by default if you attempt to opt out of it? If so
 * Is it possible to convince others than yourself of the need to eliminate the drive for status? Are people

People will then argue that, and make men ""belligerent"" (for lack of a better word). Feminists (and others) will respond that women can choose to wear whatever they please, because they (rightly) own their bodies. I believe this is the case.

In the context of social or work relationships

Now is my question: in as much as women own their body &amp; thus can choose however they love to dress, &amp; you need to desire it""), just as a man who somehow pathetically would go to a girl in a bar &amp; would tell her that he has, say, a huge penile apparatus, would convey sex &amp; dominance. Why don't we look at those two way of conveying meaning -- the verb &amp; the appearance -- as equal in this case?

Why would it be socially unacceptable for, but that would be okay for, say, a woman wearing provocative clothes? In other terms, why wouldn't it be regarded as bullying to have women wearing overtly provocative clothes, just as it would rightly be seen as bullying to have men wander and tell every girl about his penis?

**EDIT**: to clarify, but still I wanted to have your opinion on why some messages (not necessarily consciously sent, but still messages that are received by others) would be accepted, while seemingly other roughly equivalent unconscious or not messages (for instance, a rich guy overtly showing his wealth, or a man directing attention at his package) would be construed as a*hole or childish? Is that just because people (and men in particular) profit from the fact that women dress provocatively (because most people find that arousing) and rich guys or men directing attention to their package only really provoke negative reactions from others? And in this way, shouldn't women feel the opposite way about showing their bodies, etc) simply because men seem to enjoy it (&amp; therefore profit from the woman body)?  

**EDIT**: the more I think about it

 - I think what I meant to ask is in what way should we define bullying, women dressing overtly provocatively might create a strong frustration feeling in others bodies, and make them feel ill-at-ease, should that be bullying?

 - another reflexion that I have is that of hypnotism: if someone masters the art of hypnosis &amp; can, I get the sense that most people would see that as *cheating* and a dangerous behavior (no one wants to have a mad hypnotist wandering in the bar where every people go), but if a woman dress provocatively, she in a sense does exactly the same: by provoking a chemical reaction that is wired in the male brain, she effectively hypnotises men to be sexually attracted to her, but in this case it is not seen as equal to the hypnotist case by society?

Again, I'm just trying to deconstruct how this seems to me to be like other interactions in society that are naturally regarded as bullying, &amp; trying to understand what differences make that it is construed as acceptable?  

**EDIT**: other thoughts for food

 - it seems in the thread that most people make a strong difference between verbal &amp; non-verbal (whether conscious or unconscious) communication, while ""nobody forces you to look at an overtly provocatively dressed woman"" -- it might be the case, however I have the feeling that biology does force you to look at the provocatively dressed woman (and that she somehow knows it, see the discussion about why women feel good when they dress in ways that men find attractive below: http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/1aiyk3/about_the_question_of_womens_appearance_owning/c8xz0dn), &amp; second I don't really see why non-verbal communication should be seen as less intense (for instance protesting in a church by standing topless etc ) than verbal communication

Since I don't always get to engage in insightful discussion in high school

What does it mean to be human?  What is it about those brainwashed citizens that leads us to believe that there is something inherently inhuman about them?  Does technology play a big role in this?

In the context of Brave New World, I think we see that the urge to promote the species or the colony or the pack over the aspirations of the individual (if the creature is even complex enough to have aspirations).  In more complex animals, we see more individuality, but of course there is not nearly as much capacity to be an individual.

1336774381.0,tiufo,Verbs and Nouns: How should we talk about differences and tolerance?,thaumatropia,33,6,12,"I've been thinking a lot this week about discrimination and how we talk about it.

I've noticed that the tenor of conversation around discrimination and tolerance

I started to notice this with [a recent thread on r/TrueReddit.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/tffmm/we_frame_peoples_bodies_as_physical/) The consensus among those involved in that conversation was that fat people deserve the scorn and discrimination they experience because obesity is an unhealthy and offensive lifestyle choice that causes direct and indirect harm to society. The (small) minority of dissenters argued that fat people are people just like the rest of us, being fat referred to a set of behaviors that these people chose to engage in willingly, and thus bear complete responsibility for whatever consequences arise; and for the second group, being fat was part of a set of circumstances that a person found themselves in, sometimes of their own doing and sometimes not (and sometimes a combination of both), and thus assigning blame to them is not necessarily appropriate. In other words, for the people who support Fat Discrimination, being fat is a thing that you *are*.

It occurred to me that this is very similar to how we talk about the LGBT community. For supporters of gay rights, opponents of gay rights believe that being gay refers to a set of behaviors that people chose to engage in willingly (and, crucially, that these behaviors cause direct and indirect harm to society). In other words, it's a thing that they *do*, and if they would only stop doing it, we would all be better off. One interesting thing here is how much the consensus around the national conversation about gay rights has shifted over time. In the past, and as a corollary the stigma around homosexuality was strong. Over time

I want to return briefly to the fat discrimination point. Opponents of Fat Acceptance insist that fat people bear an urgent and immediate moral imperative to change their behavior in order to lessen their burden on society- in other words, bears similarites to a disability by pointing out the scale of challenges involved in substantial weight loss (with some comparing it to trying to regain motor and cognitive functions following a debilitating stroke). Opponents tend to strongly denounce this argument, either by citing a (medically dubious) mantra of ""calories in/calories out"" to illustrate that losing weight is in fact very simple, or simply by saying that characterizing obesity as a form of disability ""lets them off the hook"" too easily. Again, they insist that because obesity is a conscious choice (or, at best, the direct result of other conscious choices), and the fact that they haven't makes them morally deficient (and

But let's look at another Noun/Verb question in relation to this. Let's look at religion. Things like race, in terms of how we talk about it) sexual orientation are seen as clearly fixed qualities unaffected by the conscious choice of the individual. Religious affiliation, however, is a choice. While children can be compelled to attend church or temple by their parents with little opportunity to appeal, once an individual reaches the age of majority, they have complete control over their own religious affiliation (or lack thereof). In a very real sense, religion is a choice. Further, not to in any way dismiss how difficult it is to wrestle with these issues), religion is seen as a Noun, religious affiliation is strictly a choice

Of course, despite much improvement over the past fifty years, discrimination against women and non-whites is still pervasive and toxic.

Nevertheless, and that if we want to seriously address issues of discrimination in society, we need to deeply and critically examine how we talk about differences.

So the brain in a vat problem is set up much like the matrix, I don't see a concrete proof that we are not in such a situation.  Don't we at a certain level just need to assume that we are what we appear, human beings living in bodies surrounded by an objective, provable universe?

What can be the - probably pyschological - reason?",shenpen,36,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/184hss/given_how_huge_the_fitness_industry_is_and_how/

What does the fitness industry do wrong?

I suspect they focus too much on the science of what is good for your body, getting people in the mood, changing minds so that we enjoy playing some sport better than  eating ourselves full and getting drunk... 

I think it is mostly because the fitness industry is ran by people who always loved to be fit

For example I think they focus too little on exercises that have some external goal other than just getting fit which makes them more fun:

- playing basketball with your friends (external goal is scoring)
- skiing (external goal is enjoying the speed)

and so on. So the industry needs to make exercise **FUN**.


Similarly, we just eat randomly, unconsciously. So they somehow need to get us in the _mood_  of not simply a better diet but _generally having a diet_ i.e. somehow get us in the mood for enjoying knowing what eat, enjoying conscious eating, enjoying paying attention to eating out, shopping for food, cooking.

This is something they don't understand. They just say ""eat no more than x g of carbs a day"". But we normal people do not eat ""carbs"". We don't think of it this way. In fact we don't like thinking about it at all. We are eating a sandwich for breakfast

So either they must change our view to see carbs and proteins everywhere and not see it as salad or hot dog, and simply make easy rules that do not require much consciousness of eating for example, and be followed with a little practice unconsciously, so we can eat healthier without having a diet, without paying attention:

- you will use XYZ instead of bread for your sandwich

- you will get one small burger at McD and a side of garden salad

- you will cut out beer and if you really need a drink after work to unwind

etc.

Here, the paleo, the keto, the vegan, or anything, but having a diet at all!

Maybe the experts think people move from one diet to another, then try vegan. If they think that, they are deluded: that would be easy. Going from no-diet to diet is the hard part! Chucking most fast and processed food, forgetting your moms recipes, eating stuff that will usually feel disturbingly **foreign** because it is not what your mom cooked for you, spend time reading labels, cooking every food from scratch and so on.

We had a vegan girl living with us, stuff a random sandwich in my mouth in 2 minutes and then I am free to do something else. Or I could go arestaurant and simply order the daily offer without thinking twice. She always had this awkward questions ""what is in your vegetable lasagna?""  that made waiters smile awkwardly (they thought ""what a blue stocking! why cannot every girl live on caesar salad!"") and it would be even more awkward for me being a manly man, if fat, so my natural, expected behavior is MOAR burger and beer.

Anyone the point is not that this or that diet is hard, opposed to random eating.

**And the diet experts don't tell you this!** They give you a list of ingredients then bye. They don't tell you how to go from random meals mostly others prepare to deal with ingredients and figure out what to do with them, and eat the end result that feels foreign because your mom did not cook this. 

So far I could figure out only one way to deal with it. Be hungry. Fast. Skip breakfast, and now that you are really hungry now you are willing to invest time and attention to eating. And being really hungry, you will feel grateful for even for food that totally does not taste like your moms cooking. We are picky eaters because we are not hungry. A hungry man would gladly down a plate of steamed vegs.

So I am picking up this intermittent fasting thing

I know this all because I remember that the only diet that ever worked for me did include fasting. I was supposed to drink only this shake for 3 days and zero solid food. I was so hungry my eyes were falling out, real food in my stomach! I was not complaining that that apple does not taste like moms goulash (we are Hungarians, replace it with the foods of your ethnicity/nationality). I was grateful for it and felt like heavenly manna. And I lost 15kg while gaining muscle. It was the only diet that worked, because it incorporated fasting, and fasting made me value and respect food. It was like 3 days no food just shake, 1 week shake, shake, 1 week shake

If one argues that we are justified in killing animals because they do not have the semblance of death that human beings possess

Furthermore, is the reason that we can kill animals I ask - why do we not simply kill off all the humans that do not have a semblance of death or a heightened intelligence, such as people in persistent vegetative states?

Society's real reason behind not killing humans, is because even humans who are less intelligent than us are still 'our kind'. We rationalize our killing of animals and sparing of less 'useful' humans as 'humanitarian', when in actual fact, this is just glorified Speciesism.

Why have we made the rules? Why have we ordained ourselves to be above the rest

How can we justify speciesism

We need to lower and then eliminate the extermination of sentient beings for food, for other purposes.

Some examples:
* George Washington (US; 2 terms)
* Abraham Lincoln (US; 1 term)
* Woodrow Wilson (US; 2 terms)
* Franklin Roosevelt (US; 3 terms)
* William Pitt (GB)
* Winston Churchill (GB)

I'm going to focus on the United States from here down simply because I'm more aware of it

Here are the top ten presidents according to a [CSPAN](http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/Overall-Ranking.aspx) poll of historians:
* Lincoln (Civil War)
* Washington (Revolutionary War)
* F. Roosevelt (WWII)
* Truman (WWII - Japan)
* Kennedy
* Jefferson
* Eisenhower (Korean War)
* Wilson (WWI)
* Reagan (Cold War - not true war)

Only four of those presidents are nonbellum: Truman

The United States has been in a significant war for the following periods:
* 1776-1781 (0 terms)
* 1812-1814 (2 terms)
* 1846-1848 (1 term)
* 1898 (1 term)
* 1917-1921 (2 terms)
* 1941-1945 (2 terms)
* 1950-1953 (2 terms)
* 1964-1973 (4 terms)
* 1990-1991 (1 term)
* 2001-2012 (3 terms)

So: 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 10 + 2 + 12 = 51 years of war
and 2012 - 1776 = 236 years of existence
and 51 / 236 = 22% of the time the nation has been at war

Although the United States has been at war for 22% of its existence

But upon further examination, it seems to me that in prioritising profitability [which for many organisations is now about advertising reach and pageviews, which seems to be the case for major international corporations, local newspapers and bloggers alike], there is a built-in incentive for new agencies to ignore or under-report events which are Tremendously significant but complex or not terrible controversial *[such as illegal espionage, manipulation of foreign elections, political corruption, or the pandering to public interest in cases like The Trayvon Martin trial

Qualities we tend to pick up over time are those for which the penalty of not having them is death before reproduction.

My own guess is self-control. I can't speak for everywhere in the world, entertainment through television and the internet, etc.) Many times it is very easy to over indulge in these and lose our motivation in the process, and even become addicted. This pits us in a battle between our limbic system and the rational, thinking layer around it. Our inner animal brain bombards us with urges and emotions while our rational brain tries to placate it. Our inner brain loves to just survive and so once you enter your comfort zone, it poisons you with fear to avoid change. Often our rational brain tries to argue with it but is unable to. As our society calls it, it takes tremendous willpower and motivation to change the ways of our inner brain.

Having this willpower makes people more happier and fulfilled in their lives, and thus helps in their reproduction. Having such willpower prevents people from over eating and becoming obese, finding the energy to go to the gym and exercise and look more appealing, question their negative thoughts about their self-esteem and pick themselves up, avoid spending all their time on the internet and developing social anxiety. In that sense, I feel that our brains will continue to evolve so that our outside brain starts to become more powerful than the inner limbic one it is tied to. This will allow us to become more emotionally responsible. Although it is not fully ingrained in our biology, this is what meditation is essentially. Observing your emotions and thoughts

He also centers his arguments around the ""political objective"", and refers to ""conquering a province"" as an example.

There recently was a discussion somewhere that raised the point that we haven't seen war in its usual appereance for some time in the 1st and 2nd worlds, and war in its traditional sense will not happen at all. A sizable military force will mostly operate in peace keeping, or controlling an area while the enemy remains in the shadows or operating within the common populace.

1341478024.0,w2iqf,What should the news media aspire to do and how should it achieve that goal?,,15,5,11,"Basically, what?

My take:

I think that this bias towards ""fairness"" in media does a LOT more harm than good. Its almost as if we never got rid of the fairness doctrine. To me, cable news does it, everyone does it. The other is the tendency to go overboard with presenting differing opinions. Its not time-efficient, and it gives us a confused picture at best and a complete misrepresentation of the facts at worst. If there's a story about an insane baby-killer, we don't need to discuss the pros and cons of killing babies. In fact, we shouldn't be discussing these types of things on national news anyway, since that's the realm of local news.

What we need is networks prepared to deliver meaningful, is very confusing if all you have is a nebulous array of facts and some talking heads saying what should or shouldn't be done. So, instead of asking random pundits what they think about issues, we should have news networks that are not afraid to explain the causes of current events and the bigger picture, biases and all. What we need is analysis not editorialization. The effect of this is two-fold. First, it may make news actually interesting without resorting to a ""we're-all-gonna-die"" level of hype. Secondly, it makes it harder for organizations like Fox to present ""both sides"" and claim to be fair and balanced based on that alone.

Basically, we should have our reports explain a bigger picture, a theory to explain the facts and the causes of events, acknowledging bias in the explanation, but not shying away from it.

Examination of different Daycare Systems:

**Exclusive Daycare** &lt;&lt;&lt; the current daycare system

* Self adjusting in size/scale.
* Self supporting: Requires only the support of the parents use the program.
* If you do not like any of the fallowing: Cost, Other children, Other children's parents, Hours of Operation, Scheduled Activities, or anything else to do with the establishment.

Cons:

* You continue to pay if your child attends or not (because it includes everyone.)
* Loss of control of: Cost, Other children, Other children's Parents, Hours of Operation, Scheduled Activities, or anything else to do with the establishment. 

Political Cons:

* Expectations: The Inclusive system is burdened with expectations
A system that includes everyone
Example: Transportation 

Exclusive Systems might offer these services

* Requires an act of (Local/State/Federal) government.
* Regulation: Every service which is financially subsidized will fall under (Local/State/Federal) regulation and political whims of said body(s.)
* Support: Every additional service which is financially subsidized will receive negative push back. This system divides people
Example: (I do not have children and therefore I object subsidizing the care of your child.)
* Improvement/Repair/Expansion: Any service which is publicly subsidized may require an act of (Local/State/Federal) government(s) for any additional Improvement/Repair/Expansion. 
Which may be slower than practical and negatively affect the program.

* Achievability: This system is unlikely to pass

**The Hybrid

The Public Exclusive system is already in existence

* Achievability: The Public Exclusive System is already operated in many towns and cities
* Funding: Paid for by the parents whose children use the service.
* Subsidy: Does not require direct subsidy. Has built in subsides (Use of the school building/ teachers/staff have health insurance already.)
* Regulation: The local PTA/Administrators. (including payment method) 
* Support: Requires the support of the teachers/parents/staff that take part of the program. 

Even though it is Public

* Self adjusting in size/scale.

The functions of the foreskin in males is to…
a)    Keep the glans penis in its moist state, is actually an internal organ like you stomach, kidneys and livers ect. (which is why in a lot of cases it’s pink or “shiny” in appearance)
b)   Provide skin to allow for comfortable erections
c)    It is attached by the frenulum
d)   The foreskin
e)    Foreskin lengths vary from male to male

Do you need proof? r/foreskin has great examples of this.
 
When you circumcise a male
1. Doesn’t actually remove
2. the frenulum is generally removed.
3. For infant circumcision, some males foreskin almost completely disappears into the shaft)

 
*Note: While these are universal truths
 
I want to talk about male circumcision and why that may be a symptom of a greater
 
I personally, though unlike the majority of the United States population; I had a complication due to the removal of too much foreskin. In a circumcision, according to my pediatrician, the surgeon isn’t supposed to remove the entire foreskin off the penis. This causes immediate problems in the age of puberty. I know this, because this is what I’m currently being forced to live through. 

I’m 16
 
As noted in #2, as a result of my surgery, I’ve been dealing with severe depression, partly driven from my “morals” (which, what is right and wrong is relative from person to person and culture to culture).

Most of my depression comes from the realization that I am be forced to live in excruciating pain on a daily basis. 

No apparent solutions were apparent with the exception of the “in-activist’s” “foreskin restoration”. (I quote because the result of this isn’t a true foreskin, your penis is greater than 7in.!”.

So I understand that a lot of European males don’t get circumcised. This was brought by two (One is a Swede and one is a Brit, male circumcision rates varied. Usually, states that didn’t have a subsidy in place for it had lower, closer to European rates of male circumcision. (Mainly on the west coast) Does that mean that male circumcision is high because it’s subsidized? Then I read this on a random, circumcision article on of all sites, Gawker.


""Pretty sure you can reap all the same health benefits of circumcision simply by washing your wang. I'd be curious to know what the hygiene habits were of the uncircumcised guys in the studies. Judging by the horror stories I hear sometimes from women about uncircumcised penii they've encountered


While there are definitely men who simply get serious infections due to malignant bacterial growth

“It doesn’t seem to that illogical”

While a male can very easily, the cultural issues in the United States surrounding education and health care make it so that this surgical intervention may be necessary. (especially among poorer individuals)

There's still the significant chance of him failing for reasons outside his control.  Maybe he started a mortgage company right before the housing crash.  Maybe the location of his grocery store was just slightly out of view from someone coming down the main street.

The point is, he will be a hero to most right leaning people.  He will be a name that will be repeated as an example of doing it right.  But let's say the man put in the exact same amount of work, but one tiny thing out of his control caused his business to fail.  Now he might have to sleep on his sister's couch.  He might have to go on welfare.  He might need a government subsidized loan to get back on his feet.

Now, might be that it gets used as a means for not owning up to personal responsibilities. (Insert possible example). It also opens up an individual, or groups, for criticism. I'll cite the Dixie Chicks here (sorry) as an example. At a concert lead singer said, ""we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States [George W.

There exist two links in the above question, then democracy is an system of organization that ""makes sense"", even though we may not be fully able to articulate why. 

Elaboration:
(i)Suppose that we perceive the world as object, and ideas are considered to be ""other"" than the subject, hence ideas are object, and hence ideas are determined by the laws of cause and effect. The subject is a gracious exception to these laws. All objects are equally susceptible to the laws of cause and effect. Hence all ideas, which are a subset of all objects, are equally susceptible to the laws of cause and effect. Hence, all ideas are equal. 

(ii)Suppose all ideas are equal. Hence, and thus, all men, individuals which possess a set of ideas, are equal.

-------------------------------------------------

Opinion varied wildly, consensus was not reached, hugs were not had afterwards.  Yet less than .01% of those questioned WHY this reaction caused so much drama.  Even the most willfully obtuse of critics recognize that these feelings are genuine; things like loneliness, love, and reciprocity resonate deeply inside whatever weird thing it is that makes us human.  Teenagers studying Shakespeare might argue over whether Romeo and Juliet made good choices or exercised self-control -- ""Romeo acted like a girl, Juliet is soooooo stupid"" -- but the characters remain 100% credible.  Adults tend to recognize that they were simply young and we failed to support them.  (And incidentally that is the core of the tragedy.)

Some struggled with metaphor; of course life is not cold cruel and merciless all of the time.  But we needed to establish a contrast.  And the reason is because that feeling of attachment during sex is close to unimaginably intense at times: it has a tendency to defy description.

For the bro argument

Fourth point

-------------------------------------------------

**Most importantly from my perspective : Keen readers will notice I didn't actually pass judgement on that feeling; I don't know if it's good, and has done both to me in the past.**

I do admit there are interesting people on the Left - orthodox  Marxists and the kind of anarchists (libertarian socialists) who challenge the whole concept of permanent homsteading. They have interesting ideas to think about. So to speak the ""hard left"" can be interesting. 

But the average left-liberal, cultural relativist, tolerant, whatever intellectualism I ultimately find boring, because it all boils down to egalitarianism:

- non-judgementalism

- in other words you may find differences between people and cultures but you must not find the important enough to actually make up your mind and form a judgement

- egalitarianism boils down to subjective hedonism: if there are important purposes to live for

- I am just tired of taboos, and it is almost like a religious taboo, You Must Not Touch The Sacred Cows

- an overly reliance on feelings, as if there were not many otehr virtues often more important than ""being nice with others"", for example: pride in one's work,

- a reflexively materialist, not only atheist but completely vulgar-materialist worldview, without even offering any decent criticism of competing idealist thought i.e. the ""truth as coherence"" as the alternative worldview, just basically accepting it all uncritically, because equating knowledge with scientific knowledge,

- a dumb approach to history: every time anyone was not treated fully equally and/or not allowed to live out his/her subjective preferences he/she is ""oppressed""

- and of course ""oppression"" cannot ever be caused by anything else than the gain of the oppressor group  - or dumb superstitious bigotry

- in other words every social situation is explained either as an primitive oppressor-oppressed dynamics

- worst part? talking about ""critical thinking"" and suchlike (basically code words for being smart) and then explaining the world in the simplest oppressor-oppressed dynamics! Pretending to see through some kind of veil, the problem is not even whether it is right, but the problem is that it is presented as some ""critical thinking"" idea even when it is simplistic as hell,  and it is presented as something counter-cultural, brave and iconoclastic even though when literally millions of college-ed people believe in stuff like this! Show me five people with a degree in humanities and I will show you at least two who thinks like this - it is as mainstream as possible! At least in intellectual circles.


**My point is not even that it is wrong

One possible explanation is that simply because conservatism is even dumber. Well

Any way I see it

(OK there is one left-liberal online publication I found somewhat interesting: Crooked Timber)

Perhaps some will say I am really scraping at the bottom of the left-liberal barrel, but my point is that I was not able to find better left-liberalism even though it is supposedly the standard intellectual worldview and I spend hellofa lot of time online! Usually more intellectual left-liberal publications basically just put forth the same ideas in a more obscure language - ""addressing the social causes of crime"" for example is a more obscure way of putting ""the poor steal because The Man keeps them down"" - it is not intellectual at all.

I am not American. This matters, and I figure many American thinks an intellectual opinion is something one level higher than that of the average woodworker. I am a product of a more elitist system and for me an intellectual opinion is something one level higher that of the average community college professor - any idea that does not make highbrows go jaws dropped hardly worths the time considering. And on this test, most of left-liberalism I find intellectually boring and unstimulating, shallow and simplistic.

So why does it attract intellectuals again? Can anyone explain it?

Sorry if it is too much like a rant or too polemical.

It occurs to me that a lot of redditors hate r/SRS. Really *really* ***really*** hate r/SRS. But, where all forms of inequality are given equal weight (racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, sexism...well, misogyny

However, I don't want this to be a thread about how everyone in [[/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays) sucks and how they should be done away with, but I think it's worth considering what an alternative to the fempire would be like, especially because, I feel that it's easy to label those who are against the fempire as misogynist/racist/homophobic/transphobic.

Can we have a subreddit that promotes equality

I have a few ideas to start us off:

1. **A subreddit that hates sexism/racism/homophobia/transphobia/ableism/etc., but we are all redditors, and a lot of us have good reason to defend this place with homogenizing it as a bunch of awful people.

2. **Not having tolerance for prejudice against privileged groups, I also believe that that kind of behavior has a time and place, and while [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays) might be a good place for it, I feel places for serious discussion would not be. I particularly don't like this idea because it reminds me of how brutal internet atheists can be: yes, atheists are persecuted IRL much more than they are on the internet, but to say that religious people aren't discriminated against in a subreddit like [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) is...disingenous at best.

3. **It should be centered around education.** A lot of people who fight against this stuff every day of their lives can get exhausted, but I believe that, if our goal is to educate people on how to be less racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/abelist/etc., then we should try our best to keep that rage in check. No, going into a senseless rage over intolerance is not even nearly as much of a sin has being intolerant yourself, but I think it's something we should keep in check, no?

4. **I think we should at least try to affiliate/be friendly with the fempire.** Yes, and I think it would be best if we all recognized that, and thought of each other as respectful alternatives. I know that if this subreddit takes off, I will still be posting in many fempire subs, but here as well. :)

It has no definite boundaries.  I am software

We are a way for the universe to experience itself. And subjectivity - how do we draw our boundaries? We arbitrarily assume compartmentalization into individuals just because that's how we rationalize it. But that's just it - it's fairly arbitrary. Experience is just a mathematical abstract - inaccessible outside of the origin. As far as subjectivity is concerned, does that make it distinct from the individual parts?

In that sense, there is no difference between any of those individuals. If you can comprehend what I mean - it's that while we are all individuals, we are also the same being, that is able to meet, experience, and interact with itself. Literally. So you could call that an ""afterlife"", but also a ""beforelife""
Sorry if that's a little hard to understand

Let me try to use an example. You are born in 1903. You die in 1955. You then are born in 1200 BCE, eventually you will live the life of your mother, and your father, and that one guy who happened to be working in the convenience store when you took that road trip to Kentucky, and the policeman who you shot and killed when you were living the life of a young man in Baltimore, and your wife from that one life in 12th century France. You have lived every life there ever was, because there is nothing separating you and me and everyone else once we cease to be an individual. Ergo, and after we die.

The question comes from the context of India and their caste system. There people are born into arbitrary subsets of the population that through time and generations have been taught to believe some are superior and some are inferior. The inferior ones are exploited by the superior ones. The question is: In what direction should legislation go on the matter of preventing this? How much should authorities intervene? (If at all) After all

Now generalize this. How much should society intervene with one's personal decisions when these decisions are harming oneself for the benefit of others? On the one hand there's the above argument. On the other hand in some extreme situations (like the caste system

I would argue that a similar situation in which society has already decided in favor of intervening protecting the ones being exploited is the work market. In a situation where there's a wealthy group and a very poor group, you can't. You're forbidden. You're not allowed to make such a contract with another person. The argument is that this helps get people out of situations where they can't defend themselves and thus be exploited.

What other situations of this kind can we find? In the case of castes

I think in these two cases are very clear that one group is exploiting the other. In the first case

What about the oppression mechanism of lack of education? Imagine two people one of them has a certain high education and the other one has poor education. Imagine someone wants to get away with making a deal that benefits him and not the other person (because that other person would be better off making a better deal with someone else). That person could probably get away with making said deal with the uneducated person but not with the educated person. However, forever damaging his learning flexibility as an adult and making it impossible to defend himself against this kind of exploitation.

What other similar situations do we see or could hypothetically see?

Let me put it another way though. You own a house. After you've moved in and settled and decorated, you buy a $5000 car after your first full time job.
