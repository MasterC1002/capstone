1360504711.0,188vdw,My 10+ gram package with MDMA was intercepted at customs and I was called in for questioning by the police. AMA,onlyoneplease,482,56,94,"So I ordered a 10g+ package with MDMA from Silk Road that never arrived. I had ordered multiple packages from SR before

One month went without any news regarding the package. Then two months. I figured I had just lost the money and was a bit sad about this fact. This was by far my biggest order and I thought of it as an investement that would last for a LONG time onwards. (I had none intention of selling it

This is not to say I wasn't paranoid. Indeed, not keeping any incriminated information on my computer or at my residence. Obviously, I didn't make any new orders either. It is hard to describe how much this fact helped me later on. Even though I only talked to the police - they never searched my computer or my residence, and probably didn't listen in on my phone calls either - knowing this gave me the necessary peace of mind to confidently deny any knowledge of the package.

About the two month mark I received a note by mail from the police

Turns out, I just had to deny it and be confident that they had no real evidence. I really wasn't. Mentally, I had gone through everything I've ever done on SR and figured I was pretty safe, but I couldn't be absolutely sure. It was very nerve wrecking to say the least.

The police officer questioning me probably saw this. I tried to avoid eye contact and just looking down to the floor telling him I didn't know anything about it. He pressed me on it

There weren't to many questions. He told me that if I admitted to the crime early on, the police had really cornered me in this interview and in a way forced me to lie as much as possible.

They did also want information about my bank account. I granted them access (they asked for a specific time frame) and thought to myself that if they had some sort of vague evidence, but luckily for me it turned out okay. I was let ago after maybe 15-20 minutes.

Again a surprisingly long time passed without hearing any news. I continued to lay low and just doing what I'd normally do. Then I received a new note in the mail telling me the case was dropped because of the state of the evidence. Unfortunately

I wanted to share this story with the SR communtiy and I'm also proud of the system and of myself for playing it right and not getting caught. I have learned to be more concious about my privacy in other aspects of life and started to protect and encrypt my stuff on the computer just because ever since. Originally I wanted to post this on the official SR forum

##New buyers##

As a new member your immediate goals should be:

* Download PGP (Windows users should use Gpg4win) and visit a thread on [/r/Silkroad](http://www.reddit.com/r/silkroad) or on the Silkroad Forum to practice using it.

* Sign up for an account on [the forum](http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/) and start posting in the *Newbie* section to get your post count up to 50 so you can post elsewhere. There are usually threads in there dedicated to posting over and over to get your post count up.

* Get familiar with the *Rumor Mill* section so you can browse vendor reviews by type of drug or DoC (Drug of Choice) and you can also search at the top of that section to find a specific vendor.

* Get bitcoins transferred into your wallet so you can start ordering (discussed soon).

* Vendor feedback can be faked and is **NOT** to be trusted. ONLY order from reputable vendors in the forum from people with enough posts. This will take longer but it is how I've had nothing but 100% successful orders even when I was brand new. Don't give up!

* Vendors who have been there for more than 6 months and have over 100 transactions are very likely to be reputable

##Things I wish I had known at first##

* Some vendors will ask you to **FE** (**F**inalize **E**arly) but you should **NEVER** under *ANY CIRCUMSTANCES* do this unless you are willing to part with your money. It doesn't matter how reputable the vendor is. In fact, get away with it, and barely have their feedback affected!

* Go into your account settings and have it display amounts in US dollars instead of BTC (bitcoins); the prices become much more obvious.

* Use vendors that use the escrow system. That's why it's there! This can be easier said than done and it can be difficult to find a vendor that doesn't require FE but don't give up! So far I haven't had to FE once!

* Don't bother buying a bunch of small/cheap things to get your transaction count up. Vendors can see how much you've spent and scammers do this as well. It will do nothing but waste your time and money.

* When browsing drugs or other products, new vendors, etc.

* You cannot FE if the vendor is brand new. Vendors have to go through a process before they can sell on SR (I once heard they have to pay $500 or something

* Once you place an order

* Clicking the vendor's name takes you to their profile where you can see ALL of their listings and it shows you when they were last active.

##Getting bitcoins##

This is probably the most popular topic. There are places like Mt. Gox (mtgox) and other bitcoin exchanges to buy and sell bitcoins but I personally prefer *bitinstant*. Basically, 7-11, etc. Visit their website and take a look. It took me just a couple of hours to go from cash to real, usable bitcoins in my SR account.

##Security considerations##

As safe as Tor and SR is

* Addresses you send get deleted but your information is only as safe as your vendor is! And if SR were to ever be discovered and raided

* Do not be worried about buying bitcoins. It is not illegal and plenty of legitimate online stores take bitcoin payments. If you are already under investigation

* Use your real name and address on orders and do not order to a vacant house and I would personally recommend *against* a PO box. You can never be 100% sure how well the vendor will package your drugs and if it's something like weed then having the cops there waiting for you to pick up your mail so they can bust you would probably cause a few problems in your life.

* Vendors **sell their accounts** sometimes when they are done. Another reason to never FE. Also

The biggest thing people don't seem to comprehend is once something is posted here IT NEVER GOES AWAY due to sites like www.unedditreddit.com which allows you to view deleted comments.Besides that you can't know if reddit itself isn't storing data to hand over if they get served with a warrant which they have no reason not to. It only takes a few idiots posting specific details of a sellers packaging methods to get a sellers shipments marked and hunted by the DEA/USPS and with the rapidity of this subreddit I'm sure it could happen before the seller even knows things were posted. The really ridiculous thing is the entirety of the conversation on this subreddit could be done on SR forums and that location is way more heavily moderated and controlled(I'm sure the mods here do what they can it's just ridiculous to even try on a clearnet public forum). It's just convenience and laziness that encourages people post here.

I've been ordering acid and mj from SR for about 4 months now, this was my 4th purchase of mj and i became overconfident and ordered a QP, since 4/20 is coming up and i got my friends to pitch in so we would not run out, and maybe even make a little profit on the side. I should mention all orders were done from the same vendor, he is one of the best vendors on the SR and I don't blame him for what happened, I just got too cocky and shouldn't have ordered such a large package.

Now, sign and show my student ID. When we get a package we get a little notification from the uni saying ""you have a package, please come pick it up"", etc. Risky and maybe stupid I know, but I did my research, keep our entire apartment clean of any and all evidence, ordered from the stealthiest vendors, but this QP was taking longer and I started to get suspicious. 

What do you know, so I just sort of take it from him and hold it in my hands, looking at it. I paused for maybe 15 seconds (I honestly don't know, time stood still at that point) just staring at the box in my hands like an idiot, but then it suddenly hit me that yes, this is a controlled delivery and if you don't get your shit together your life will be ruined (i have an internship with a big government contractor, parents know nothing, ""We get all of our packages delivered to the university mailroom. No one ever goes directly to the address, and foolishly thought maybe they'd let it go since I never actually signed anything) He knocked on the door once after that but I really didn't give a shit, then just left. 

We inspected the package thoroughly and thought it MIGHT have been opened, guy in a blue jacket and a university cop behind him. He tells me he is a federal postal inspection agent, yadda yadda, and starts trying to intimidate me, saying they know i had drugs shipped to me, and they will get a warrant to search the premises if I don't give them back the package, etc., so I just took it and said ""please take it officer

Compartmentalization is the name of the game.

- bitcoins

purchasing bitcoins is LEGAL. it's surprising how few people know this- while it's true that btc are used for guns and drugs

you can buy bitcoins using your real name, etc. 

the transition from wherever you purchased coins to the silk road cannot be traced either. silk road tumbles your coins

the legality and tumbling makes everything safe and anonymous- you really don't need to complicate the process.

after asking r/sr

- purchases

while purchasing IS illegal it is unlikely to be monitored or traced back to you.

try to buy things in small quantities that fit in envelopes

cocaine

- messaging / finalizing

yes, don't start worrying until it's been more than a few days.

don't bother vendors with small questions or ask for constant updates. they're busy people. message them when they ask you to message back (for finalizing or confirming you're alive

finalizing early means you immediately release bitcoins to the vendor before receiving the product (a sign of trust on your end or distrust on theirs). finalizing early is the most likely way to make sure your product doesn't get to your doorstep. please, but they are few and far between. 

- shipping

use your real name and real address. as torrrr points out

always use PGP. if they don't have PGP you shouldn't be ordering from them

don't bother with a PO box- they are not worth the hassle or cost and establish a more direct link to you and your drug purchases. 

order domestic to expedite shipping- many offer next day delivery because there are no customs. 

give it 3-4 days domestically before asking questions and AT LEAST a week/two weeks if internationally. stuff really does get lost or takes time to process. 

- receiving

it's usually very safe to sign for your stuff or receive it in person. most dealers will

 - Always use your real name and a real address.  Shipping to an abandoned house, and who he delivers it to.  If all the sudden he has a package going to an abandoned house, that's going to raise suspicions.

 - Don't order multiple different substances at the same time.  It's a lot easier for LE to make an argument for drug trafficking if you're importing multiple different substances.  Stick to one at a time.

 - Don't accept the mail directly from the mailman.  Just wait until he puts it in your mailbox and leaves, so make sure you give it time before opening it so you know you're safe.

**What are the chances of being caught?**

I forget where I read this, let's say your package has a 6% chance of being detected.  Now if that does happen, then they have to decide what to do about it.  The vast majority of the time, if it's personal use amounts and they don't have any other evidence, they will likely just send you a ""love letter"".  This is just a letter saying they intercepted a package with illicit materials in it.  If you get a love letter, consider that address ""burned"".  Never order anything illegal to it again, because it will likely be under more scrutiny.  If they have more evidence against you, or just decide to go after you for whatever reason

**Controlled Delivery**

1.) Postal Inspector finds your package and determines it to contain illicit material.

2.) A warrant is acquired, and replaced with an inert look-alike material.  They seal it back up in a way that you can't tell they ever opened it.

3.) Surveillance and research is conducted on you and your house.  This phase can often last as much as a week.

4.) Police surround and contain your house.  Undercover cops will cover all possible routes of escape.  A postal inspector posing as a postal worker will come to your door, they might not need you to sign to arrest you).  They have a search warrant that is conditional on you accepting the package.  If you sign for it and accept it, the postal inspector will leave, and they will give you a few minutes to open the package to increase your guilt.  Then they will raid the house, finding any other illegal stuff, and arresting you.

**What to do if you get a Controlled Delivery**

Well, they no longer need you to sign for it.  They can just arrest you and raid your house.

If the only evidence they have is this package being sent to your house

What this means for you, and you don't want to accept delivery when you don't know what it is.  There is nothing illegal about receiving drugs in the mail, as long as you didn't order them.  Anyone can put your name on a package and ship it out.

Your chances of getting a controlled delivery with personal use quantities is very low, and the vast majority of the time you'll make it out OK.

**Potential Criminal Charges**

 - Unlawful Shipping / Misuse of Mail System - It's a Felony to use the mail system to send or receive drugs.

 - Possession (possibly with intent to sell) - This generally depends on the quantity and number of different materials that you're caught with.  Could be a misdemeanor or a felony

 - Drug Trafficking - If the package crosses state lines, assuming they can prove that you ordered it.  This is also a felony.

It is not crazy to think that if caught you could easily be facing multiple felony charges

Receiving drugs in the mail carries a stronger punishment then buying them from a local dealer.  It's important to know the potential risks if you're going to engage in something illegal.  Hopefully this short guide helped you better understand the risks involved.",,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/182j73/usa_if_youre_going_to_use_the_road_you_should/

1. Go to www.bitinstant.com  
  
2. Select cash to bitcoin address  
  
3. On your SR account
  
4. For your notification email they ask for on the bitinstant website form

5. After you fill that out
  
6. follow the rest of their instructions and make sure you print out the pdf with all the information (account number and code and such). take this form with you to CVS.  
  
7. Go to the customer service department (or photo department lol this is where the moneygram stuff was when I went). Just pick up the red phone and listen. You will be asked an address, same bullshit with the name. Any name will do (try and make sure it matches the fake one you originally used on bitinstant though just in case), and say you chose not to give your phone number.  
  
8. They will eventually tell you ""you are paying a company (zip zap) please go to the counter and tell them your name and that you are paying a company""  
  
9. go to the cashier and tell them you are so and so paying a bill/company with moneygram and they will confirm the amount of cash.  
  
10. after you give them the cash

  
  
GENERAL INFO:  
Bitinstant will give you a specific amount. i.e. $242.97 and you MUST have exact change when you pay.  
  
Make sure you have enough. There is a 4% fee plus zip zap takes like $3.99. So to be safe
  
If you go home and would like to see where your BTC currently are
  
It should take about an hour or two from depositing until the time when you have BTC in your account. Happy shopping :)

We however were inexperienced with H at the time so we didnt bother to msg UGS. Over the next two months I began to see reports on the SR forums and in supertrips feedback that he was selling fentanyl as h. I assumed it was just a couple bad batches and decided to order a gram of supertrips ""afghan #4 heroin"" around the end of may to see for myself because supertrips was offering a g at a ridiculous price.

VI) INSTALLING AND SETTING UP LINUX

VII) INSTALLING TOR

VIII) SHORT INTRODUCTION TO PGP VIA TERMINAL

IX) ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS

-------------------------------------------------

I) INTRODUCTION

First of all

Your security is divided in 3 parts. Also remember your security (as in lowering chances to  get caught) is only as strong and your weakest link. Those 3 parts are : 


a) Money

You can (and will) get caught if you aren't careful with how you move money. Banks and LE work hand-in-hand to trace money. I won't cover that aspect but you need a bulletproof way of buying (if you are a buyer) and/or selling (if you are a seller) your bitcoins.


b) Drugs

Yes, stealthing, receiving packages, storing. You get the idea.


c) Information

Here is the part I'll develop in this guide. How to handle information (mostly digital information) to not get caught and be as stealthy as possible.

II) SOFTWARES USED AND LINKS

All the following softwares are :

1) Free - you don't have (and shouldn't

2) Open source - Anyone with knowledge can see what the programs are made of. Def a security plus.

We will need (In order of use) :


a) a good anti-virus

Before even starting the job
I personally use AVG. Here is the link but it's recommended you search it yourself using google

http://free.avg.com/

b) a password manager

You'll need to save at least 5 complex passwords. I strongly recommend using a password manager (with passwords creation) such as KeePass. It's multi plateform (windows/linux/android).

http://keepass.info/

c) TrueCrypt

Very powerful piece of software which allows you to encrypt files/folder or even full system partition using bulletproof algorythm such as AES.

http://www.truecrypt.org/

d) VirtualBox

Very powerful software which allows you to run a completely autonom virtual machine inside your physical machine.

https://www.virtualbox.org

e) Ubuntu 13.04

Free OS. Very safe. Not so user friendly but you'll only use it to browse SilkRoad and use PGP (more on that later).

http://www.ubuntu.com/

d) Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)

A package of pre-configured software to use TOR. Awesome.

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en



III) ENCRYPTION USING TRUECRYPT

I assume you already installed the antivirus and ran a minutious scan on your system. Your system was clean already ? Great

So first

a) Click on ""Create Volume""

b) Select ""Create an encrypted file container""

c) Select ""Standard TrueCrypt volume""

note : Do your research on which option you want to use.

d) For Volume Location
!! Note : You can select a USB pendrive (with at least 10GB and USB 3.0 strongly recommended) so that you have a portable

e) Encryption Options

I advise to use AES. The technology is old which
I don't know about Hash Algorithm. I think I use RIPEMD-160 but it's up to you to do your godamn research on which option you want to use.

f) Volume Size

Pick at least 10gb
Note : TrueCrypt will encrypt the whole 10GB no matter what it is you put in

g) Volume Password

Open KeePass (!!!!!!!! with a strong masterpassword !!!!!!!!) and generate a random passphrase using at least 15 (25+ advised) characters (with lowercase, symbols, space everything checked). Save it carefully, and copy paste it twice in TryeCrypt.

h) Large Files

Select ""Yes""

i) Volume Format

Move your mouse randomly (to create randomness in the Key) a few seconds then click ""Format""

Congratulation

IV) CREATION OF A VIRTUAL MACHINE USING VIRTUALBOX

First, and click on random letter (remember it and always use the same to avoid corruption). I personally use R: (don't ask me why, I guess I used it the first time and it stuck).
Then
Then, you can know access your encrypted folder using Windows Explorer in computer. Truecrypt created a virtual partition.

Okay, save the .iso file somwhere.

a) Open VirtualBox, it'll automatically select the type and version needed. Click ""Next"".

b) Memory Size. 
It's the amount of RAM you want to allocate to your virtual machine. I personally have 12GB of RAM and I allocated 4096MO to my VM (virtual machine).
Note : Consider that the amount of RAM you give to your VM gone from your physical machine. Even if you don't run anything on your VM
Click ""Next"".

c) Hard-Drive.
Select ""Create a virtual hard drive now""

d) Type of hard drive file
Select ""VDI (Image disk VirtualBox)""
Click ""Next"".

e) Select ""Fixed Size""

f) File location and size
For location
In size
!! Note : very important. For exemple,50 Gio. !!
Click ""Create"" and wait a minute or two for VBox to create your VM.

V) TWEAKS TO VBOX

Here are the settings I use for my SilkRoad Machine.

To access settings
Go to the onglet ""System"" =&gt; ""Proc""
Go to the onglet ""Display"" =&gt; ""Video""
Click ""OK"".


VI) INSTALLING AND SETTING UP LINUX

a) Open VBox

Now you must install Linux on it. A window will pop up and ask you to select a booting disk. Click the yellow folder and browse to the Ubuntu.iso file you previously downloaded. Click on ""Start"".

You VM will now boot using Ubuntu. Install it

Select ""Erase disk and install Ubuntu"". File in the settings needed. In name, you don't mind extra lawyers of security. Click ""Continue"". Now, wait, the installation can take up to an hour or two. 

When done, DON'T anything and wait. Now you have a beautiful orange/purple page asking you for your password. Type in the password you wrote during the installation process and press Enter.
Welcome to Ubuntu.

b) You need to setup a few things.

First

You'll notice those black borders onto the sides. That's ugly and bad for your eyes. To remediate

To do so, Click on ""Install Guest Additions"". An autorun window will open up, select ""Run Software"" and click ""OK"". Enter your Ubuntu password. Click ""Authenticate"". An ugly purple window will open with ugly white characters, it's the terminal. We'll use it later for different stuff. Wait a minute or two until you have the terminal says this ""Press Return to close this window..."". Press Return on your keyboard (above Enter) to close the window, ldo.

Reboot the virtual machine by going to the very top right of your screen.
Now to go the options, click the Gear with the Red hammer or whatever you call it in english (I know it's not a hammer). Double click on ""Displays"",  pick your favorite resolution. Click ""Apply"" then ""Keep that resolution"". Much better, cierto ?

You will notice the OS seems slow and laggy

Run the terminal (push ALT + F2 and type in ""Terminal""
Copy past that command :

/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p

The following should appear :

Not software rendered:    no

Not blacklisted:          yes

GLX fbconfig:             yes

GLX texture from pixmap:  yes

GL npot or rect textures: yes

GL vertex program:        yes

GL fragment program:      yes

GL vertex buffer object:  yes

GL framebuffer object:    yes

GL version is 1.4+:       yes

Unity 3D supported:       no


As you can see, enter password when asked. When ""asked to continue [Y/n] ?"", type in Y then press enter.


sudo bash -c 'echo vboxvideo &gt;&gt; /etc/modules'

Shutdown the virtual machine (you can do it manually inside the VM or press Right CTRL + Q and select ""Send extinction signal"".

Go back to VirtualBox and go to configuration =&gt; display. Check Activate 3D acceleration.

Boot your VM

/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p

You should now see that Unity 3D is supported and your OS is fluid. Don't expect native performances tho

VII) INSTALLING TOR

Run your VM. Open a firefox window and go to https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

Select the Linux version and download it. Close Firefox. We want to use that machine on the clearweb as little as possible.

Unpack (or drag&amp;drop) the tor-browser_en-US folder in the folder ""Home"" or desktop or whervere you want.

Open the folder and double click on ""start-tor-browser"". It will open a weird text editor with gibberish stuff in it. Close it. We need to activate an option first.

Push ALT
In dconfg-editor go to: org =&gt; gnome =&gt; nautilus =&gt;preferences
Click on ""executable-text-activation"" and from drop down menu select:
""launch: to launch scripts as programs.""
Close dconf-editor.

You can now launch TOR. and browse anonymously the road.
I strongly advise you to install KeePass for linux by going to Ubuntu Software Center to save passwords for Silkroad as well as your PGP passphrase.


VIII) SHORT INTRODUCTION TO PGP VIA THE LINUX TERMINAL


PGP is a powerful protocal that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages and files. It has been used for over 15 years and is the standard all over the world for industry and governement communications.

So first

A) Creating your own keys

To do so

gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...

Ok

To create your key

gpg --gen-key

Type 1 then hit Enter

You'll be asked to chose between 1024 and 4096 bits. Chose 4096 (the most secure)

Next window, then type Y, press Enter.

You are now asked to enter your name

Email adress : a@a.a or whatever you want

Comment : none

Type in ""O"" to confirm

Enter passphrase, there is no limitation AFAIK.

Then you'll be asked to do random stuff on your computer to generate bytes to ensure randomness in your key pool. Do stuff

What we want to do know is to export the public key so that you can share it with your sellers/buyers.

Type :

gpg --armor --export your-email-adress-used-before

Copy paste the public key in a .txt file on your desktop and share it whenever you buy/sell.

B) Importing a public key

To send a message to someone, close &amp; save it.

Now

Put your cursor in the very top left of your screen and click file =&gt; import

C) Encrypting a message

Open the terminal and type :

gpg -ear name-or-email-of-your-contact &lt;&lt;end

Press Enter
Type your message

Press Enter

You'll have your encrypted message. Something that looks like that :

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)

Post your question - stupid or otherwise - here to get an answer. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action

I do ask that you refrain from abusing noobs in this thread. Feel free to link to guides, other subreddits (particularly /r/bitcoin and /r/drugs [though many on the Bitcoin subreddit don't take real kindly to SR]), or the FAQ, though.

Also, which no legitimate Bitcoin exchange does directly. He's using a rotating array of obscure URL shorteners to evade the automatic sitewide spam algorithm. His usernames are usually, but not always, gibberish, and usually, but not always, only used to post one comment or link. Some of you report it when you see it, so please always report it when you see it. I delete and ban it when I see it and I know other mods do as well. There are other scams

Another thing I want to mention is that you should never use onion.to for SR-related tasks. You lose all anonymity by going that route. Your ISP and/or your university IT department can tell exactly what you're looking at if you use it. Even if you visit onion.to using Tor

**This post covers US law

First let me start off with this: 

http://i.imgur.com/IOMcImv.jpg

This is a picture of my Drug Offender Registration card.  That's right

http://i.imgur.com/uDdxNBq.jpg

This is a picture of court paperwork from my two drug cases.

Now that we got that out of the way

EDIT: Let me just add that my arrest was NOT related to my use of SilkRoad.


**""Mom... I'm in jail...""**

It seems to me that the majority of SR users have never been through the legal system

1. An officer pulls you over

2. You will be transported to the county jail

3. You'll get to county and be booked by a booking officer.  This means fingerprints

4. You'll be interviewed, or be ""housed"" in jail with the other inmates.  Forget everything you've seen on TV about jail.  If you ever end up here, just know that everyone in there is ready to fight at a moments notice, but they don't actually want to.  Be respectful, DO NOT touch anyone's stuff without asking first, don't even sit on someone else's bed without asking for their permission.  YOU ARE A GUEST HERE, ACT LIKE IT.

5. If mommy and daddy haven't bailed you out yet, and then appointed a public defender if you can't afford a real attorney.  If the judge determines that you can afford a real attorney, then it's your responsibility to find one and sort that out.  (Keep in mind you can only make collect calls from jail)

6.  At this time the judge will set your bail again.  If you don't have a record, so they release nerdy white kids like us to make room for others (mostly violent offenders, and those on probation holds that aren't eligible for an OR release.)

7.  If for some reason you aren't OR'd, A) You will have limited contact with family and friends and B) You don't get to just ""talk to your lawyer.""  Unless you can afford a private attorney (trust me, you probably can't,) you won't talk to your attorney until you go to court, and all he will do is tell you how fucked you are.

Notes on Jail Reality VS Movie Jail:  The cops are going to ask you where you got the drugs.  They might even tell you that they can ""ask the judge to go easy on you, be respectful, but **do not be a snitch.**  The police have already arrested you, even if they wanted to, they can't just ""drop charges"" or ""let you walk.""  They are now legally bound to due process law, meaning that they have to get you in front of a judge within 3 business days.  You can only dig your hole deeper at this point by talking to the police, I mean it!  The cop might even seem like a nice guy, you're just a dumb kid who made a mistake

More about talking to police:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkZf6_jK3Zs  This is an AWESOME lecture about police interaction, it's not as boring as it sounds.


*Now, IF IT GOES TO A JURY TRIAL.  The process of taking a case to trial is MONTHS down the road, and if you haven't bailed out by now, you will be sitting in jail for months waiting for this to happen.  Over 90% of cases never make it to trial.  After your initial arraignment, you'll appear in court several more times (I went to court 12 times over the course of three months before I was released from jail) and every time, you are at their mercy.  You don't get to argue your case, until it actually goes to trial, most of it is between you and a lawyer

Keep in mind that during this time you are missing classes, or lose your job?  Think about this!

**So how does this relate to SR?**

You get caught having drugs delivered to your house.  You are in possession of drugs.  Whether it is through a controlled delivery, and you will spend AT LEAST three days in jail before ANY decisions are made (if you don't bail out, which will cost you 10% of your actual bail amount (In my case this was about $5,000) that you will never get back, do you have $5,000 on hand?  I don't either.)  All the cops have to prove is that you have drugs in your hand/pocket/car/house/body in order to take you to jail, anything else is not their job.  If you have a public defender representing you, in some states you can go to prison for having a joint on you

**About taking your case to trial:**

""Ok

Sure, if they do win at trial, they are going to really ream you for wasting the county's time and money in the court system.  So now, since you passed up their offer of 90 days in jail and 120 hours of community service w/ 2 years probation, they are gonna give you the low term on a felony charge that carries 6 months/1 year/3 years!  Shit!  Do you want to risk that in a court room?  I sure don't. 


So that's some of what you are looking forward to on the post-arrest side of things

**""Fuck

You've got a couple girlies in your car, you're still fucked.  They'll arrest you on suspicion of LSD possession, and they aren't gonna drop that charge until your drugs come back from the lab and they know what they are, and guess what, the lab is backed up for at least a month!*  Anyways, you're cruisin' and you get pulled over, FUCK!  Now what?

Be polite, and you better have reasonable cause because YouTube told me I don't have to tell you shit!""  This is the time to sit down, shut the fuck up, and do what the cop says.  UNTIL HE ASKS YOU, ""Do you mind if I take a look in your car?""

If the cop feels the need to search your car, you do not have my permission to search my car,"" but it is a HUNDRED times better than saying ""Sure go ahead,"" thinking that he won't find your stash.  Because when he does find it (and he will!) you just buried yourself.  I have been pulled over, told the cop ""Go ahead man, search away, I've got nothing to hide!"" and ended up in jail because I did have shit in the car.  I have also been pulled over TWICE that I DID NOT consent to a search, they might have trouble getting a warrant, and keep going.  Consenting to a search though is just opening the door for them to find your shit.

**Do you have anything in the car I need to know about?**

NO.

I know you think being honest with the cop and telling him ""Well, but it isn't.  Cops only ask this question to make their jobs easier when dumb-ass kids actually admit to it.  You're going to jail either way, make him earn his paycheck by looking for your shit (heck, maybe he won't find it!)

**Possession W/ Intent To Sell**

The difference between going to jail on a possession charge, you're fucked.  Because that's all it takes to show that you had an intent to distribute those. All of your cash will be taken as evidence.  Bag up your shit when you hit your destination, not beforehand!  Some states even have extra penalties for transporting drugs with intent to sell!  *IF YOU DON'T NEED YOUR SCALE, LEAVE IT AT HOME*  If you have a backpack with a scale, baggies, and a big bag of something, you're asking for trouble.  In the law's eyes, I KNOW MY RI-"" Nope

Be super careful when transporting drugs!  Traffic stops are where most drugs are found!

**Who's name do I put on the package?**

In my opinion, etc), than to actually get a ""controlled delivery.""  Use your real name, mainly to draw less attention to the envelope in the first place, and also because when the cops knock on your door, they don't give a fuck who's name is on the envelope if it's in your hand.  Sure if you take it to trial a few months later you can argue that someone else sent you the drugs etc, but that point goes out the window if the envelope has been opened.  If it was addressed to John Doe, all that proves is that you open other people's mail.

One thing I can tell you about this is: Don't put someone else's name on it (who actually exists) without their permission, you shouldn't be doing drugs.  IMO, using someone else as your fall-person is the SR equivalent of snitching.  Don't do it, it will not help you, and it could GREATLY fuck up someone's life.  Maybe in the end you'd beat the case, but do you really want to send your own mom to jail for three days potentially?  I've been to jail, several times

1373243667.0,1htzcy,Just found an awesome thread on the forums. Noobs listen up!,LongLiveThe_King,116,19,22," Frequently Asked Questions / F*cking Asinine Questions
 
So
 
About 80% of the threads focus on the following questions. I'm going to provide the typical answers.
 
 **1.) My package hasn't arrived
There are a couple of possibilities:
   
   a) Your package is on its way

   b) Your package has disappeared. LE may have got it

   c) The seller didn't send it (and I'll bet you finalized early)

   d) LE has it
 
In all of the above situations
   
   a) Contact your seller politely and see if they can shed any light on  the problem

   b) Clean house. Make sure you have no paraphernalia or drugs in your shipping address.

   c) Go on with your life as usual; if you are in some way compromised any unusual activity will be incriminating. Remember
 
If you've been through all of these steps
 
 **2.) What do I do if LE come to my door?** 
Deny any knowledge of the illegal contents of your package. Don't go into detail
 
Providing that you maintain a clean house (no drugs in the house, you should have very little to worry about in most cases. 
 
Unless
 
 **3.) Should I use my own name and address?** 
It depends. Yes with a but
 
Yes, no other illegal material) then it is most likely OK to use your name and address. The key point to this is to maintain 'plausible deniability'. You should have no criminal history, a clean house, and be smart enough to follow the advice in #2 above should things go sour. The benefit of using your address and name is reliability, and plausible deniability. You are much more likely to be able to claim innocence signing for a package at your own door than you are showing up to a PO box in a fake name at 3am.
 
Variations on this theme are sending mail to your current address under a different name. In some countries this can work, than drugs in another person's mail that you have kept or opened).
 
If you're moving large amounts, mister Escobar.
 
 **4.) Should I sign for deliveries?** 
You should choose a seller who does not require signing for deliveries.
 
In the event that you're unexpectedly asked to sign
How much did you order? Do you have a criminal history or history of seized packages? Did you use a reputable seller? Did you use your real name and shipping address 
 
If, have had several cocaine shipments not arrive, ordered from a vendor in Colombia with crappy feedback and had it shipped to a fake address; then you would be clearly making a mistake by signing for that package.
 
If on the other hand you ordered a 3 blotters of LSD, ordered from a reputable vendor and had it shipped to your house in your name then it would actually be more suspicious if you DIDN'T sign for the package.
 
Most cases will be somewhere in the middle. Weigh up the above factors and see where you sit; it's a good idea to have this decision made ahead of time for all orders you make
 
 **5.) I'm Australian
Good for you. Stop posting the same questions over and over
 
The general consensus from what I've read:
95% of international shipments make it through Aus customs
Aus customs DO NOT appear to routinely send love letters for illegal drugs
You're much safer to buy domestic. If you don't like the prices
 
 **6.) How long does shipping from X to Z take?** 
Google it. Honestly...
 
If you must know specifics

 **7.) Some packages failed to arrive
Short answer, it is not SAFE. You can continue to use it, but at increased risk.
 
It's not impossible to get a new receiving address. This would be a good prompt to explore your options.
 
 **8.) I got a letter from LE
If you got a letter
   
   a) Your receiving address is no longer safe

   b) The package that was intercepted was not

   C) You can do yourself no good by saying ANYTHING
 
Shred the letter, and get a new receiving address if you choose to come back. If LE show up at your house, follow the advice in #2

I know what an 8th of pot is but for something like that????? and I'm just not that type of guy... anyway... he won the debate.

Just wanted to raise the flag on this. I've warned people on the forums already. Don't give this repeat scammer any business. He's back again and he will inevitably scam again. He is an unstable character with multiple personality disorder who is unable to keep all his lies straight and blackmails customer's into FEing by threatening things like police action.

You have been warned. Be smart. Do NOT give boostintoHYPERSPACE any business. Also



If you could take a moment to please click this link and report the vendor then you are doing your part to fight scammers on SR! Thanks.

1371909500.0,1gut23,"Reviews on everyone I've bought from (fungifun, kwikEmart, curiosity1, nawlins, NiceDeal, rogerpete, jesusofrave, Tryptonite

**fungifun**: My first purchase, all of which were answered. I settled on the vendor and made my purchase, and received my package not too much later, with a little more than I had ordered. I never really got to experience the shrooms myself, but the friends I gave them too said they were mindblowing. Would recommend.

**KwikEmart**: So I'd gotten molly off the street before, I bought some of his green bulls to go with some acid a friend had bought off the site, and I had been expecting something similar to what I got off the street. No siree. Holy fuck those green bulls are nice. While they may be a little more expensive than powder, these green bulls are potent and convenient, and you can easily dose without a scale. Also has fast shipping. Very strongly recommend. I used his green bulls for both my candyflip and my hippyflip; the stories can be found at the bottom of the reviews.

**curiosity1**: When I bought from this vendor, I was intrigued, and bought a tenth of a gram. The package arrived and a friend and I set about smoking it. However, we really didn't have any pieces good for DMT, and we were too impatient to create or buy one, so our experience is fairly limited, as we wasted a lot of the powder on trying to pull GBs but having the powder fall through. However, as it was similar to how I felt on following DMT trips. I can't fault the vendor for what was our fault and make assumptions about the strength of his product

**nawlins**: I purchased 3 of his 2CB capsules. They arrived and some of my friends bought them from me. The friends said they tripped balls off these capsules, so overall this vendor is a good choice.

**NiceDeal**: I bought 2 of his Cheeba Chews

**knicknack**: This man had THC pills. I placed an order and it was marked in transit

**rogerpete**: From rogerpete I purchased some DMT. Once it arrived, I went to a friend's house and we smoked a bunch more of it. While, due to our inexperience again, we were never able to breakthrough completely, one of my friends said he did see us as green alien-like beings. So definitely a legit item.

**HollandOnline**: I spent a good while browsing for a good LSD vendor, but I figured it's just people complaining. So, weeks go by, my product never comes. I spent some time on the forums, and around the time I placed my order, a significant amount of people in the US (where I am) were saying they weren't getting their packages from him. As a result, he stopped selling the United States, my guess is he decided to stop selling to the US for some reason

**Maggots**: From Maggots I ordered weed cookies. They came fairly quickly

**NewFavoriteVendor**: From this vendor I purchased shrooms. These came pretty fast, with a sixteenth of an ounce I'd bought off the street. While I definitely tripped from that experience, the eigth of NewFavoriteVendor's shrooms took me into hyperspace. Words cannot describe what happened. Definitely recommend. These shrooms are involved in my hippyflipping story at the end.

**jesusofrave**: Fairly upset about my previous experience buying acid, and I distributed them to a good number of people, the vast majority of which liked what they got. They do taste kind of bad I thought, but they are definitely acid. Would recommend.

**theDankBank**: theDankBank sold me a DABR pen. For those unaware, and I gave the wax to a friend, so I can't comment on that, but overall this dude had good stuff.

**hackthegibson**: On a Wednesday afternoon, figuring at least one would make the deadline. And make the deadline this man did. With his fast shipping, my friend was able to get it in time for his trip, and my friend was happy enough with this purchase he gave me money to buy him another seven grams. Overall, a good vendor.

**NewAmerica**: NewAmerica was another of the vendors I purchased two grams from that day. However, who said it was good stuff.

**Tryptonite**: Typtonite was the other vendor I bought from that Wednesday, so it's safe to say this is good shit.

**BigBill6778**: A friend came to my house to browse the site, as the vendor had about 85% rating I believe and a lot of comments about long shipping times. My friend didn't care, as his product was cheap enough that he didn't mind. So the purchase was marked in transit fairly quickly. As the time for finalizing drew near, the package did not arrive. I placed a week extension, and the vendor agreed. As the time extension ran out, I proposed another, as many commenters said it took around a month to arrive, saying he had sent it twice, but honestly it was not even that big of a purchase that I cared enough to contest it. 



Stories


**Candyflipping**- I had 2 hits of acid from a friend, I took the LSD at around 1:30 PM and the 2 green bulls not too long after, as I figured they'd have a shorter come-up. At around two, a friend came to pick me up, and he also took 2 hits of both acid and green bulls. Then we went to a another friend's house. There, one of our friends was day-drinking, and the other had taken 2CB I'd bought from Nawlins. We went on the back porch and hit a couple GBs until the pizza they'd ordered arrived. This was maybe forty five minutes after the first ingestion, and I found it difficult to eat the pizza. We continued to take GBs, my drunk friend was having a good time
	Maybe around 2:30ish, I started to worry that I was getting fucked up too fast, as I still had a decent amount of time until the peak hit. Then, the molly started to kick in. Hoooooooooooooooooly fuck. I started talking my ass off about everything. I tried pretty hard to understand what was happening on Dragon Ball Z, but it was just beyond me. I felt euphoria like never before. A little after three, another sober friend came over for a little bit. He took me and my friend on 2CB for a short drive around the neighborhood. It was snowing on and off, so in his car he put the heat all the way up and blasted some Shpongle. The music is what really set it off. I remember just talking nonstop about crazy shit and watching everything around me go crazy. If you put every previous happy moment of my life on a scale where 100 was the happiest event, we went back and watched more Dragon Ball Z and played N64 games. Then we went to a park and walked around. This part kind of sucked



**Hippyflipping**- So a friend and I went to his house for a night of crazy shit. I brought a fourth ounce of shrooms from NewFavoriteVendor, along with some weed. So we each ate half of the cookie and took a green bull, and then ate an eighth of the mushrooms about fifteen minutes later, so as to half them all kick in at around the same time. Then we went outside and smoked a few GBs. We only managed to take a few before our lighter died, so we went back inside and tried to play some Xbox. However, it got real hard to focus, so we put on Planet Earth (a very high definition nature documentary series). 
	While watching this hour long movie about the rainforests, there were animals scurrying across the screen, and I told my friend that it was getting too intense and I needed to sit down. He looked at me, laughed, and informed me I was already sitting down. I was absolutely stunned when I looked down and saw that I was in fact sitting in a chair. As the film progressed and the drugs kicked in more and more, reality got beyond real. Both of us experienced ego death, and we agreed on many different points over the night: that we'd beaten life and were now in some sort of afterlife, that we were simply the universe, they were probably complete gibberish in actuality) about how everyone is just imagining themselves and the fact that we're all one being so words are pointless as the one being that is us knows everything. Slowly

He wrote back and told me all he could do was send me a free list of hidden Tor links. WTF??? I don't need or care about that. I'm about to start my own vendor account and just give out all his links for free.

Anyway, he scams selectively apparently Do not buy from him.

When I originally posted on here I NEVER expected to blow up like I did and get so many fans and orders and everything. You guys rock, and crazy style. I'm sure you've been aware that business is booming and demand is through the roof. So I guess that means I need to do another giveaway or whatever. Well here ya go:


Every week I'm going to post a question or request and whoever I deem has the best entry will win a 1g sample with free shipping and everything in return for a review on here. If business continues to go well I will do two giveaways; one to whoever I like the best and one to whoever reddit likes the best and if it's the same that person wins 2g. The only problem with this plan is I need ideas people. I'll give you some time to prepare for the first four weeks as I have some already in mind. 


Week 1: Best smoke story(I would win this one by the way. I'll share mine in the thread.)

Week 2: Best smokespot

Week 3: Best smoking piece

Week 4: Best smoking collection. 

Requirements:

Any photo must have something proving it was taken by you(if there's proof that it's for me that's bonus points.)

All writing should be done using correct grammar, if you have the best smoke story ever and can't write for shit, you might still win. If you lie on your story, think about what you're doing. You're lying to win a gram of marijuana; is that really necessary? I have no way to verify stories so I just have to believe in you /r/silkroad. 

By winning my sample you agree to my terms as laid out in my vendor profile. The only part that really matters is ""Don't be a dick."" If you lie, that's being a dick. Any of this will get you disqualified and I will write you a very angry letter, full of big and terrifying words sure to make you quake in fear. 

Yesterday I posted a trivia question in return for a sample and that got me thinking. I hate the stigma of stoners being idiots and so I want to incorporate an intelligence or trivia facet into this giveaway but have yet to find a good way to do it so give me some ideas.

Please remember that the escrow service is there for a good reason guys so make sure you take full advantage of it. I would also like to share some of the potential warning signs to look out for if you are new to the game.

1: Seller has some bullshit excuse to why you are required to finalize early otherwise he won't do business with you. Fuck them just move on since there are countless other vendors who don't require this to be done. I can name you heaps of vendors who even state ""*New buyers welcome


2: Vendors feedback mainly consists of alot of brief feedback eg: ""FE early trusted seller 5/5"" in a very short amount of time.


3:The description of product is very brief and eg: ""TOP QUALITY HYDRO BUDS"" with no other knowledge of the product itself. 


4:The prices are unbelievably cheaper than the majority of the market for the same product.

*But the most important is obviously point number 1*

People may not agree with me but Australian users will be aware of sellers such as ""EnterTheMatrix"" who was one of the most trusted sellers in the business who made off with thousands and more recently ""SmoothSailing"" who deleted his account yesterday also making off with thousands.

1373478162.0,1i0r8l,Dead Pirate Roberts addresses commission increases,SilkRoadGuru,87,15,38,"&gt;Hi everyone
&gt;
&gt;There has been quite a bit of discussion about the commission that is charged to vendors on Silk Road and I'd like to do my best to put some misunderstandings to rest.  Many things were changed in a recent update to accommodate displaying and pegging prices to many currencies.  One of those changes was the way the commission is calculated.  This change had virtually no effect on the vast majority of sales on Silk Road that occur in the less than $1000 range.  The commission did rise on larger volume orders.  I've always felt that the 2% or so that was being charged on high priced orders was kind of low and decided to make the minimum commission 4%.  I intended to inform our vendors of this through a message, but despite what some of you might think I am a normal human being and capable of error.  In any case, the warning of the commission change did not make it to the vendors, so when they realized the commission had been raised by about two percentage points on high priced orders without warning, they we're rightfully upset.
&gt;
&gt;However, but multiple threads have been started now and the misconception has even spread to other websites.  Hopefully this post will put the matter to rest.
&gt;
&gt;As I've said all along, this is subject to change at any time, and vendors have been equipped to handle changes in the commission without being warned ahead of time.
&gt;
&gt;The percent commission charged at this point can be found with the following formula:
&gt;
&gt;6.7 x e^(-p/6) + 4
&gt;
&gt;where p is the price of the listing in Bitcoins.  So, or 0.5265 btc.
&gt;
&gt;To give a little more perspective, lower priced items are virtually unchanged.  I think we can all agree that the service being provided by Silk Road to bring together a multitude of buyers and sellers and provide a safe platform for multi-thousand dollar deals is more than worth an extra 28 bucks.
&gt;
&gt;That being said
&gt;
&gt;Yours always
&gt;Dread Pirate Roberts

This needs to be brought up. People are getting way too cocky about the safety of SR. I've been saying this on other threads for a while now and people seem to have taken the stance that ""if it's made it this long without being shutdown

I'm going to share some things with you to show how dumb that is. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Straight from the mouth(or fingers) of Dread Pirate Roberts(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168353.msg1200106#msg1200106):


""It's been over two years and Silk Road is still here.  We've had setbacks here and there, invincible, even cocky.


I encourage you to look for this in yourself and refrain from acting on it.  A thread was recently started in this forum publishing the personal information of LE agents that users had a particular grudge with.  Let me make this abundantly clear:


We are not strong enough to attack our enemies directly! 


If we start organizing attacks from this forum against LE agents



I'm going to repeat something:

""This task is hard enough as it is

That is the exact opposite of the ""we've made it this far"" attitude from the man who set up everything that has made this possible. You might say, but it shares the same principle; We're not strong enough to resist the full power of the world's governments. So stop with that shit. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Many people say that encryption is where our safety comes in. According to Atlantis only 15% of users use encryption. And the real kicker:

""Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately

Wanna know who said that? Edward Snowden. As to what he means ""The consensus is that while encryption such as PGP works

Last but not definitely not least. This has been confirmed by Astor on the SRF that it is indeed a legitimate threat:

1372611269.0,1hddwq,OGBRYAN Review - 1oz OG Kush,silkroadthrowaway21,91,25,31,"Good morning and thanks for reading.  This is going to be a comprehensive review on my experience ordering 1oz of OG Kush from ogbryan via the Silk Road.  

Prior to ordering I took the time to read through his vendor page.  I saw that he ships three times per week (Mon

I was quite impressed with the speed of the delivery and as well as the packaging technique used.  It's obvious that ogbryan took the time to package the contents in a way to eliminate any traces of odor via multiple layers of vacuum sealed bags
I've read that smart vendors double package in the instance that the box/envelope is destroyed and needs to be re-packaged

Now,  that if asked, I could  easily identify this strain by scent alone within in a lineup of dozens of other strains.

As soon as I broke open the bag I knew 100% this was top notch OG Kush.  The smell permeated throughout the room as I gazed in awe at the beautiful herbage that I just received in the mail. The bud was properly grown, because OG Kush was one of the most difficult strains I have grown, and this stuff was perfect.  The buds were all pretty close to the same size with the average bud weighing between 1-2 grams.  There was no popcorn buds, shake, or leaves in the bag.  The vacuum seal was done in a way to avoid crushing or compressing the buds.

I decided to weigh the sack before putting it in a glass storage container.  It came out to 28.2 grams

The flavor of this smoke was absolutely delicious. It burned completely white which tells me that zero organic compounds remained inside the plant when it was chopped.  Typically if growers continue to provide a high-strength dosage of nutrients late into the flowering period

All in all I rate my experience with ogbryan as a very enjoyable one.  He was prompt and discreet when it came to shipping

Grades:

Stealth: 92/100

Shipping speed: 100/100

Vendor order processing speed: 100/100 

Herb quality: 94/100

Overall Experience Rating: 100/100




edit: this vendor does not require early finalization.

1369001891.0,1enmxo,"Three Reviews: Northwest Direct, NorCalKing, and Californication",litigiouslyours,80,13
Strain: Sweet Skunk
Scores: Shipping/Stealth: A+

Communication: No communication attempts made on either side

Shipping: I ordered on a Thursday, but I had a great experience. The weed weighed a little heavy. Awesome. I don't know what happened to the guys who are upset, but whatever it was, it didn't happen to me.

Also worth noting – NWD's shipping methods were easily the best of the three. Without revealing too much, just good bud.

Stealth: Very good

Cost: NWD is charging approx $260 USD for an ounce w/ shipping. Cheaper than average.

Buds: Definitely on the small side. I bought enough to justify getting some large buds, and had a light smattering of hairs which leave trichomes on your fingers.

Picture: http://i.imgur.com/13MKOeS.jpg 

In fairness

Smoking: I hadn't had any previous experience with the strain

It's not a ridiculously potent strain, and instead produces a surprisingly functional functional high – the most functional of the three. In short, it's a good afternoon or for a group party smokeout, but isn't the best strain for a Friday night when you want to get blazed. You'd have to smoke a boatload of this to get dysfunctional. For what it's worth, it's a very smooth smoke; you get a bit of sweet aftertaste as you exhale.

Value: NWD gets you a boatload of solid weed really fast. Tops in value, this is not the vender for you.

**NorCalKing**
Strain: Sour Diesel
Scores: Shipping/Stealth: A-

Communication: No communication attempts made

Shipping: Shipped fast; 4 days between order and delivery for somewhere nowhere near Northern California. Weighed a tad light (0.2 grams)

Stealth: Good stealth. Didn't smell anything until passed the last vacuum seal

Cost: NCK doesn't sell many strains in bulk on his public listings

Buds: Good bud size. Noticeably dry compared to the other two, but well manicured. 

Picture: http://i.imgur.com/2iqeBig.jpg 

Smoking: I've had several Sour Diesels

NCK's Sour Diesel is almost a purely a head high. NCK says that his is a 90/10 Sativa/Indica hybrid, dreamy feeling does also produce some anxiety. I'm not a guy who gets anxious when smoking, but I have friends who did get a little tweak-ish after smoking this. If you get paranoid or “tweaky,” buy something else.

Sour Diesel smokes just like it sounds. It has a pungent, however, for daytime smoking. It doesn't make you sleepy or lazy at all, and so you can still be plenty productive after smoking at any time of the day. 

The complaint here is the potency. Whether it's a result of less-than-sticky weed, it would be nice if there were more affordable quantities greater than 1/4 oz. There was nothing wrong with the high, just that you'd need to spend some cash to get it.

Value: When you consider that NCK is charging for a 1/4 oz what others charge for 1/2

**Californication**
Strain: OG Kush
Scores: Shipping: B-/Stealth: A+

Communication: I was too high when I ordered and mucked up the PGP. Californication was super nice about my mistake and we got the situation resolved within a day. He followed up with shipping information

Shipping: I got it in 4 days, so I'm not about to fault the guy for being a day off. The big complaint here is that his vacuum squishes the buds more than necessary, which is kinda annoying, since he sends MASSIVE BUDS. Why bother sending super premium buds if you're going to squish them?

Stealth: Best stealth out there. I won't go into details

Cost: $325/oz shipped. About average for SR premium weeds.

Buds: By far the biggest. These are the smallest buds I got. I think the picture speaks for itself: 
http://i.imgur.com/ibOuhtz.jpg 

The other buds in the package were bigger, if they hadn't been so tightly packed in shipping.

Smoking: There is some debate in the SR forums about who is selling real OG Kush and who's selling knockoffs. I don't really care about that; all that matters to me is how it smokes and the high you get. And holy shit

{Well

One puff and you want to sit down, munchies, and a fair amount of euphoria. This stuff gave me the first case of “giggles” I've had in months. 

What I'm saying is this is really, too – so be sure not to smoke any OG Kush when there is anything else to be done, because you're probably not doing it. 

Value: Very good value. The price is about average for an ounce on SR

**About the reviewer:**

I'm an average pothead in an average town nowhere near the west coast. I've been smoking for long enough that I think I can speak to what people are looking for in upscale weed in urban areas which don't have lots of MMJ dispensaries like Cali and Washington.

1368299607.0,1e54uq,PSA: The chemistry underlying the purity of substances,,75,18,24,"Often times

**Salts**

First

Go take a look at your medicine cabinet.  Some of your prescriptions or OTC medications might say ""&lt;name&gt; HCl (hydrochloride)"" or ""&lt;name&gt; HBr"" (hydrobromide).  These are salts!

Chemists like to use these acids to produce salts of compounds for many reasons, succinate, tartrate, etc).  You can look these up on Wikipedia for more information.

**The case for salts**

In their pure organic form, chemists vastly prefer to work with salts rather than pure organics.

For example

Salts are awesome because they...

1. are easy to handle
2. are (mostly) water-soluble
3. are more bioavailable than their organic counterparts
4. are readily purifiable via recrystallization
5. (mostly) do not lose their respective organic functionality

There are also other reasons

**MDMA as a salt**

Everyone seems to like MDMA

MDMA-HCl (3

When the chemist has MDMA in his flask

[Here's an image of what I explained above.](http://i.imgur.com/YYWtzgJ.png)  MDMA is on the left

If you did this to 100% pure MDMA

We need to consider the masses of the compounds!

          MDMA: 193.25 g/mol
    +      HCl:  36.46 g/mol
    ------------------------
    = MDMA-HCl: 229.71 g/mol

The 84% simply refers to the fact that MDMA-HCl contains 84% of MDMA and 16% HCl *by weight*.

           MDMA: 193.25 g/mol
    /  MDMA-HCl: 229.71 g/mol
    -------------------------
    = by weight: 84.3 %

You can apply this logic to any salt under the sun!

**In conclusion**

Make sure to check the ""maximal"" purity of a substance before you spend money on it.  If someone tries to sell you a substance that exceeds the ""maximal"" purity of that substance's salt

Well, they tell me they had this a few times now, that their package takes way longer than usual. I never heard of this before, this is domestic German shipping, but OK.

Now

I know their reviews are good but it is very strange that I don't get the product within Germany and that they tell me BS to make we wait longer. And afterwards they are rude ""no

I am pretty sure they either made a labeling error or forgot to send it at all. The actual chance that the German post office loses a correctly labeled domestic shipment is closer to 0.001%.

1366655764.0,1cvnas,My first journey on the road: The story of an informed person,PeteEckhart,71,17,37,"After a few months of research on Bitcoins as well as Silk Road


**The Beginning Research**


Being obsessed with computers at a young age, however, I didn't take the time to research too much into it until I heard about the prices going up to $200, I mean who wouldn't be intrigued? I had also done some Deep Web exploring over the years and of course had found Silk Road.  I would pour through it and think to myself ""damn, I wish I had some Bitcoins and could buy something."" 

Flash forward to this month, reading every guide from learning how to utilize PGP encryption to sorting out reviews on the product page vs. reviews from reputable posters on the forums.  I was confident I was ready to make a purchase.


**The Purchase**

I started with three tabs open in my Tor browser: Silk Road category for cannabis, I also wanted a vendor with good quality product and free shipping without requiring me to FE.  


Not too far into my search, and generosity (I mean, a pre-roll that is packed to the brim, really?).  I noticed one bad review that was quickly followed by a few customers of his coming in to discredit the bad review.  I saw that he had free shipping without requiring me to FE.  I read his vendor page at least 5 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything and wouldn't make a stupid error.  I was sure I had found my vendor, so I got my Bitcoins, loaded them into Silk Road and was ready to go.  


PGP encryption was a breeze using Kleopatra and the PGP Guide on this subreddit.  I had my coins cleared, and there it was, in all its glory.  I quickly rushed home, opened up the extremely stealth, odorless package, and gleaned with excitement as I found its contents and breathed in what had been previously masked.

I have been a customer on SR for about a half year and almost exclusively purchase bulk weed and cannabis products. I purchase a couple LB's weekly and resell locally so I am always looking for low prices on high quality bulk product. Recently I have been purchasing a few LB's of caliconnect's weed because of how low his prices are. Indoor for 2800/lb. I got a few pounds of really frosty, the size of a pea about, stuck between the calyxes (clumps that weren't ground fine enough to look like THC). The clumps are pure white and look like baking soda and crumble with your fingers, definitely NOT anything organic OR healthy. Also I rolled a few joints and the joints literally sizzle the entire time they burn, which I have never experienced and definitely signals that something weird is in the bud. What i'm saying is I think this guy contaminates his indoor weed to make it look more visually appealing. I have yet to contact him, just waiting to see if anyone else can confirm that his indoor is sprinkled with powder.

Why do you guys think the joints and blunts sizzle and crackle the entire time they burn? Why would there be a clumps of white powder between the buds? Please let me know if I am just tweaking or if I might be onto a dishonest vendor.

It was delivered. And I'm not expecting anything else in the mail. Would it be okay to go and try to pick something up or should I just stay away?

I have not actually opened the package yet and I already wrote ""return to sender"" in red ink on the front just in case LE does come knocking on my door.

Edit: Opened the package late last night. Everything was in there as expected

To verify you can see I am mod over at [r/atlantis](http://reddit.com/r/atlantis/)

Hopefully we can just have an open friendly chat in the spirit of free marketplaces as up until now confusion and misinformation has always seemed to prevail. 

Essentially I believe we (the people who use black markets) have more in common than we have differences and to keep the dark web united it would be nice to have just a little more openness and clarity between us.
To be honest it surprises us too that many people have such strong opinions one way or another when fundamentally we see ourselves as only doing a solid and offering choice (as well as a backup) to the black marketplace. 

It kind of reminds me of two people after a breakup trying to keep face but I feel to just let our guard down a  bit and just engage you guys for a while if you feel like it.

I will check back in about half and hour and hopefully we can have a good discussion

This coming Tuesday we'll be rolling out some changes that should be welcome to our members who are used to using currencies other than the US Dollar.  Support for 34 new fiat currencies plus gold and silver will be added.  You will be able to view the prices in the market along with your account balance in these currencies

So for example, you will see more or less steady prices across the market even as the exchange rates fluctuate.

Every order goes out day of (if put in by or before 9:30am est) and a tracking number is sent within hours after your order. Very professional person, I cannot recommend him enough.



**PartOfTheDance**: Deals in shrooms. Insanely good quality, but I received my package within 2 or 3 days (sent from East Coast to East Coast). He was my first vendor I used for shrooms and I absolutely will not go else ware, as I'm very happy with his product and service.



**supremesmoke**: Deals in high quality china white. Probably the fastest shipment I've received on the road. Order placed Thursday night, so extreme measures weren't really needed to package such a small amount). Quality is grade A, best I've ever had, and while his prices are a little expensive, it's worth every penny based on the quality he offers.

http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131861.msg1032365#msg1032365

Context: Multiple new buyers claiming mysterious no-shows within a few weeks span of time.

&gt;Coming to the forums adds credibility to everyone else's eyes so we are ""fooled"" into thinking that the package didn't arrive in hopes of earning themselves with a false sense of trust. Most of these people that are pulling these scams are quick and 'clever' college kids looking to earn an extra dime on top of their quarter since the refund check they got from [insert overly priced private school paid for by Mommy and Daddy] wasn't enough play money. Those that typically lie for their personal advantage and come from such a background will try to fabricate a relatively detailed story. What do these quick and 'clever' kids think? ""Oh hey, act heartfelt with 'day updates (""day 10, still waiting..."")' and other common concerns/thoughts (""I'm sure I'm just being impatient and it'll be here tomorrow lol can't wait to try!""), pretend I never got the package and get a full refund because I'm an asshole.""

&gt;With that said, but 4-5 individuals in a few week span? Nope, nuh-uh, sorry but I'm not believing that one damn bit. The raw fact of the matter is this and it's been echoed over and over again: lucky is not here to fuck anyone over. He employs phenomenal stealth unlike most of the Dutch equivalents for he and his customer's protection (MBB, anyone?), ships within the same continent, provides a far superior product, because you have to pay the fee for a premium service. Don't expect to get HBO in HD by paying for nothing beyond the electricity that runs your shiny new flatscreen television.

&gt;Gatillac, but I've absolutely had enough with this shit throughout SR in its entirety. These conniving little thieves need to stop toying around like little high school prima donnas so the adults can continue having fun. It's the fuckheads kids like that that ruin this game and need to sod off with their bullshit antics already. Maybe if they stopped rolling/drinking/doning every damn weekend, took the time to thoroughly research the drugs they're taking beforehand, and learn to completely respect the substances, then they wouldn't have to result to petty thievery.

So I'm gonna use the knowledge I learned in my Stats class to figure out what the true probability is that a random person ordering would receive a package from Silk Road from the data received. Keep in mind that the probability that I get is going to include the following: Domestic packages, and Intercepts. This fits binomial probability conditions and, as well, also fits the Central Limit Theorem (if you don't understand this, just know it makes the math a lot easier). Now I realize the probability will be biased because this is not a true random sample (this is only an online forum, but it is random enough for real world limitations). It is also an independent sample. Anyways, I did the best of my ability from this data to deduce the number of total packages sent to the number of successes received. Taking n = total number of packages and k = the number of successes (number of received packages), not just of this study. To do this, I can) but I got a probability of 0.0215 (which means for your first purchase

Now I'm off for a beer. Cheers everyone!

I ended up starting a vendors account on Atlantis and have quickly become the #1 vendor there. I have 100% delivery rate and my packages arrive in 2-4 business days. 

I really want to get on Silk Road, where all the profits will go to my SilkRoad vendor account fee. I am offering a home made strain called Snow White Kush for $45 an 1/8th (I also have ounces for $250, QP's for $850, and HP for $1650). I'm not selling 1/8ths of this strain except through this special, I just wanted to make sure people could try it in smaller quantities if they wanted to. I have created a stealth listing that can only be accessed through the link at the bottom.

So if you've wanted to try out Atlantis or just want to help me get a vendors account on Silk Road here's your chance. I plan on offering budget weed to AAA+ to bulk. Here's the link.

What: Operation **Road** Runner

When: April 8

Where: New Jersey

Who: A bunch of guys in professional jobs who clearly didn't know each other, not because they knew or interacted with each other. At least one of those busted sounds like he may have been a vendor.

Method of bust: Unknown. Unlikely that they all received controlled deliveries on the same day. Unlikely that they all received drugs in the mail on the same day. They must have been being watched for quite some time.

Who should be worried: Anyone who ordered anything from a New Jersey vendor who hasn't been heard from since Monday April 8.

As for the product I have not yet tried it yet seeing as im going to be a first timer but on his reviews everyone says its a very clean roll a lot of small white crystalline powder in the gram bag. 

Mrhumbolt- ordered two ounces of his blue dream for 406$ and the shit is bomb. Got four days later to east coast and it was worth the price. It gets you pretty dam high and are all huge dank buds. Very pleased with his pricing and product will definitely come back to him. 

Nicedeal- Ordered the cheeba chews product and packaging was fine only thing I didn't really care for were the chews. They worked as intended but think I would enjoy smoking more than eating weed lol. The Indica one did get me pretty high though to the point i had minor visuals in the center of my vision which was cool. The sativa one wasn't as strong for some reason. Overall exactly what i paid for and on time. I guess they are good if your dying to get high and can't smoke somewhere. 

Ogbryan- Ordered an oz off of him of his less good stuff and it was dank as shit. 280$ and it was very tasty with small popcorn buds. I would say his weed taste better than mrhumbolts but the price is higher and honestly I think mrhumbolts blue dream gets me higher. Decent packaging and arrived within four days.

*full disclosure

*FE: this is the biggest and more pressing issue it seems to mist of you here. As a customer I have FE'd for a couple people, so I obliged knowing his reputation). Another, I was just in a good mood and it wasn't a crazy large order. So, obviously, it's your call. FE, don't FE whichever. But, please try and see this from a vendors perspective. New customer accounts cost $0, by claiming the package wasn't received or the product was fake. As a vendor there's not much you can do about this besides providing a tracking number and pray, but in the end if someone finds that unreasonable from a vendor with 100% feedback and hundreds of transactions, 3 weeks is a long time to have no cash from drugs you already sent out.

*""Bunk"" drugs: This makes me laugh, fuck those people. But hey, this isn't fucking Amazon with guarantees and customer satisfaction surveys and recourse for everything, you are dealing with illegal substances dealt on a black market, sometimes that shit is gonna happen. You have ZERO right to be all up in arms about it, you are taking a risk by (once again) ordering FUCKING DRUGS from DRUG DEALERS. Shits gonna happen, don't be shocked. You aren't entitled to an explanation and a refund, mistakenly or not. Just inform the vendor and see what he/she says

*TOR/SR: Hey, it's most likely flooded or you're on a bad tor tunnel, have patience and retry, it takes time, this isn't clearnet.

*Buying Coins: BST seems to be your best option by all the feedback

*Cashing out: If you're a vendor or the such and need to cash out, that shit ain't free, don't buy Moneypacks and load them into your PayPal, that shit is easily traced if someone wants to. You're paying for anonymity.

*Signing for shit: Check with vendor before ordering, and you need to sign for it, don't get all rattled, you knew you had to sign, unless the package is all fucked up or unsealed then resealed you really have nothing to worry about. Just sign for the fucking thing and enjoy. If the vendor doesn't require a signature and you're asked to, then a red flag should pop up. This whole bullshit I see here about ""NEVER sign for a package"" is total bullshit, check with the vendor.

*Impatience: Come on, the Post Office has very short hours Saturday and CLOSED an Sunday. Explain to me how your vendor could have shipped your shit? Calm down and wait for it, once again, it's not Amazon.

In short, don't FE if you don't want but understand why its done, chill the fuck out and enjoy your drugs

1367202019.0,1db7vc,PGPClub and a critique of Atlantis. Also Pine AMA! :),PGPClubPine,54,15,43,"  I thought it would be appropriate to comment on why using PGP is important.  
    

  I get the same vibe from Atlantis promotional material as I do with the relentless Privnote endorsements. The admin of BlackMarketReloaded, and I have no problem with that whatsoever. So this isn't a ""Get off my Lawn"" comment:  
    

  Secure communications cannot and should not be automated because of the security illusion it creates. If it was an easy problem, the consequences are much worse than simply having a busted business model, it's time to Go To Jail, Do Not Collect $200.  
    

    
  LEA [law enforcement agency] hate PGP because it makes hacking a darknet market's servers a very messy process indeed. They can capture everybody who enters a plaintext address (by being a passive adversary, assuming they are rational, is to make a political point. Otherwise they shall listen passively, trying to accumulate as much data to deanonymize vendors as possible.  
    

  This environment leads to SR customers and vendors assuming that SR is already compromised, since black markets must have some element of Pareto efficiency to them, most of  the professionals with larger volumes are certain to be using PGP.  
    

  The best that LE agents can hope for is a critical mass of vendors being too naive to understand why they should use PGP encryption, an Eternal September is one of the biggest threats to a Darknet Market. It is also why education is the key to SR's survival.  
    
    
    
  If they are LEA then my hypothesis is that they are using the same strategy as the Thugs.  
    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee
    
  &gt;""Thuggee is described as a cult of people engaged in mass murder. The modus operandi was to join a caravan and become accepted as bona-fide travellers themselves. The Thugs would need to delay any attack until their fellow travellers had dropped the initial wariness of the newcomers and had been lulled into a false sense of security, require accompaniment for hundreds of miles - the Thugs would wait for a suitable place and time before killing and robbing them.""  
    
  By having sufficient numbers of people not using encryption, LE ""Thugs"" could slyly disable the immunization effects of PGP encryption over time, using the acidic blend of stupidity, laziness and ignorance to erode people's commonsense.    
    
  I do not know whether Atlantis is made out of LE agents or merely just a bit naive about how their approach to encryption is being perceived
    
  As others have pointed out on SRF
    
    
  Either way, it's a human information security problem. If they did build up to SR's size without pervasive use of independently used PGP then they will only have succeeded in becoming the juiciest of the low hanging fruit.  
    
  There are ways to improve on SR's security model and business model

*You can use whatever return address you want on when sending registered mail. Even if its out of state from where you are mailing.

*The only time a seizure letter is sent

*Opening a package is a serious thing needing the permission of a judge. They are not customs and can't just randomly open packages hoping to find drugs. When a package is opened its because they know that it will 100% contain some kind of narcotic. In the event that even the smallest amount of a controlled substance is found

1364939235.0,1bjlg7,REVIEW: Big ups for MDUK,ifucked__up,46,9,48,"Well tonight was incredible. I'm still rolling pretty good but it's controllable and I feel talkative so I can write a nice review.
I got in on MDUKs new vendor special for 2x of his 110mg Molly right before he ran out

It got here pretty quick from UK to US. Can't say the exact date it arrived because I was out of town for about 10 day. Our mailroom held my packages over that time and I got 3 orders in today. These were actually my first three SR drug purchases

Stealth- 5/5 really good and the pills were well disguised. i was very impressed.

Communication: 5/5 Really cool guy and really understanding

-------------
Alright so last night I just went to bed halfway through the review just because it was taking so long to get the words from my head onto the computer haha. So here's my review of the product

PRODUCT: 5/5; I'll start my report out by saying I've only rolled twice before yesterday

So I went on a whim, so I took one of the 110mg capsules, at around 4:20. I wasn't sure if two was going to be too much, so I saved it for later in case I wanted it. After I took the first one, me and a buddy of mine took a bike ride to the beach to find the spot where he had hidden some of his wax before break. When we got there, we decided to walk around a bit and enjoy the view of the beach and the lagoon. I was starting to feel the come up about 50 minutes in, but it wasn't too overwhelming and I wasn't sure if I was rolling yet. But I did feel pretty good. So we went to a really cool spot on campus and i climbed down to the water's edge

About 10-15 minutes after that, i would close my eyes and feel the cool breeze around me, and it felt fantastic. He wanted a coffee on the way, so we stopped in a coffee shop. As he ordered I was looking at some really cool paintings they had up and the colors were just so vivid. It was really incredible and that's when I knew it was gonna be a good couple of hours. I turned to my friend, gave him a big smile and a thumbs up. He knew what was up.

We went into another buddy of mine's dorm so they could smoke. I just felt like enjoying the roll by itself at that point so i decided not to join. We hung for about 30-45 minutes

When I got back one of my roommates was in, being roommates, and girls. It was a really fun conversation and then I put on some deep house on the speakers and just grooved for a bit. We continued to talk and I felt like we grew closer. I told him how thankful I was to have a roommate like him, yadda yadda yadda. Looking back now a lot of the things i was talking about seems pretty childish and silly, especially when I look back at the 2 or 3 messages I sent MDUK while I was rolling. But I mean I was rolling HARD. I felt like a young child, I was so giddy and the world around me looked so beautiful and vivid. He left for the gym, and right around then my other roommate walked in. We talked as well, and it was just beautiful. I was having so much fun.

Throughout this whole time, but I definitely felt it yesterday.

When I was starting to come down, and headed up to their room to smoke some. I bought 2 Grams and smoked a good amount up there.

Smoking brought me RIGHT back up. I was back into heavy rolling about 15 minutes after my first bowl, and went over. I stood in the back and listened to headphones as they played zombies, it was pretty great.

I decided i wanted to be alone then

The comedown was sooooo easy

All in all, but I just couldn't really put it into words other than ""I'm having fun"" haha. But anyways, thank you SO much MDUK I'll definitely be in contact in the future for further orders, as I've got a bunch of concerts coming up in the area.

If any of you guys have any questions about my experience just let me know

EDIT: I forgot to mention how clear-headed I was throughout the whole thing. The roll was just SO clean and I was able to process thoughts at a pretty normal level. I was having so much fun but like didn't feel ""fucked up"" like some drugs make me feel. Again only my 3rd time rolling so I can't say if it's the best out there but it was really fun.

1367442999.0,1di9ru,Logical argument to why you should boycott vendors jumping ship to Atlantis,norcalking,99,66,61,"Hello

 Some of you will recognize me from SR

Vendors who jumped ship after three days of downtime to a very new and untestest service is putting themselves and therefore their buyers at unecessary risk. 

The following reasons are why I believe this in no particular order:

Atlantis front page makes many claims

On their forums and on their site their administrators spend a massive amount of time talking about silk road in a negative fashion and how much better they are. If they really were better wouldn't they be adding new features to the idea instead of just playing catch up? Atlantis did not even launch with auto-finalization

Their staff encourage you to share your connect your identity back to Silk Road which increases a vendors attack surface. It allows for security vulnerabilities at atlantis to affect the customers of SR. By doing this the vendor is taking alot of risk admitting their identity to a very new site. 

Atlantis encrypts messages locally on the server side

I'm not suggesting Atlantis is DEA or some government entity

* Communication (5/5)- I ordered around the time he did his AMA here

* Shipping/Stealth (6/5)-  Shipping to US took a little more than a week.  This was my first order

*  Product (?/5)-  Unable to test it

2) Silo-  100 x 25c-NBOMe

* Communication (10/5)-  He answered all my questions within an hour.  He had shipping issues and kept me informed the whole time.  We even had a nice chat about his products and what he hopes to have in stock for the future (LSD).  Really awesome dude.

* Shipping/Stealth (5/5)- Shipping was around a week over a holiday and weekend.  Steath was just fine for domestic orders.

* Product(5/5)-  His tabs are potent as advertised (1000ug).  One made for an excellent night out with friends.  

3)  Chem4Coin- 10 x Etizolam

* Communication (N/A)

* Shipping/Stealth (5/5)- Package took 6 days to arrive over a weekend.  Blended in nicely with all my other mail.  I thought it was something else I had ordered off the internet.

* Product (?/5)- I had some spare change and thought it would be a good idea to have benzos on hand.  Waiting for a bad trip or a lazy day to try it.    

4)  MUSHBUD- 10g Powder Sample

* Communication  (5/5)-  Fast and friendly replies.  

*  Shipping/Stealth (4/5)-  Shipping time was slightly over a week.  The only issue I had was the lack of return address

*  Product (5/5)-  I got his second batch

5)  GrandWizardsLair- 2 x 5mg DOM tabs

* Communication (N/A)

* Shipping/Stealth (5/5)-  I ordered priority shipping

* Product (?/5)- Have not tested yet

6)  Hallucinating Horse - 1g MDMA rocks

* Communication (5/5)- He replied in a few hours and was kind when answering my questions.

* Shipping/Stealth (6/5)- I ordered the ""Where the hell is it?"" steath

*  Product(5/5)-  I felt comfortable ordering at this point, no powder.  I have never tried MDMA before, but look forward to taking at an upcoming concert with friends.

Following any one of those 200btc blocks leads you to apparent “mixer” transactions, small amounts of value peeling off of the larger amount at each hop.

SR Forum topic link: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.0

Edit: oops

1367245091.0,1dc6zb,Vladimir (Atlantis admin) official statement,reaperx2,39,8,28,"I saw this posted in the SR forum and figured I would repost in case others have difficulty accessing the forums. 
Hi all

It has come to our attention that some users on Silk Road believe the following;

1.  That I am a scammer and was involved in a Ponzi scam on Silk Road.
2.  The moderators at Atlantis market are deleting user comments.
3.  Our forums term of use policy is aimed to arrest people and record information.
4.  That we are DDoS'ing Silk Road.
5.  Our PGP system is crackable.

I'd like to take the time to address each point and if you have any questions

1) This belief has come into existence as 'Vladimir' was a scammer on Silk Road and thus people thought I was the same person as him. Unfortunately without knowing Vladimir's past history, we have suffered no down time, no users have lost funds and security concerns have been addressed promptly (like increasing PGP key support up to 16Kbits).

2) We have deleted posts only related to spam

3) We used the default term of service which comes with the forum software. You can find an exact replica when you download and install the SMF software. This has now been updated. 

4) We believe competition is healthy and believe that Dead Pirate Roberts is a great leader. We also need to shed the light that Silk Road has had technical issues in the past, site upgrades and switching hosting providers all caused down time. Although it would assist in us gaining more market share if our largest competitor is down, we have no desire to resort to dodgy tactics. We believe that what goes around comes around.

5) The auto-encryption service only works IF the user or vendors uploads their PGP public key (we support key sizes of 1024 - 16384 bits). However, they can STILL manually encrypt the message outside of Atlantis and thus there is absolutely no risk of anyone being able to decipher the message. To this day, PGP with large key sizes (&gt;= 4096bits) is still uncrackable, you can find more information about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality. Noting: 'there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means.'

As stated earlier

1367499878.0,1djqsh,Vendor Review: MDUK,throhagay,43,10,11,"A few weeks ago I decided to order half a gram of his acetone washed MDMA. It was my second order from SR and was shipped from the UK to the Netherlands. The reason I went with MDUK instead of domestic suppliers was his presence in this subreddit and his promise of a very pure product. 

This was my second time using MDMA. The first time I used  I took half a pill (they were around 180mg) after which I redosed several times over the course of the night and ended up taking almost 300 mg total. Not very smart in hindsight! It was a great night but the body load was pretty bad and I ended up having a sore jaw for days.

For this second time I stated by parachuting 120mg. The really weird was that for the first 45 minutes I didn't feel anything. I was starting to get disappointed. Now I knew they weren't bunk because I had them reagent tested and it was fine. I decided to wait some more.
And what do you know


I ended up not going out that night but just staying at home chilling with my girlfriend

Communication 5/5- 1 or 2 days after I had placed my order I got a message that he had some problems with the washing process and that he basically messed up a batch. He said it would take him a few days to send and that if I didn't want to wait he would cancel my order without a problem. Messaging was very fast and professional 

Shipping- I cant say much about shipping times since he had a delay with his batch. However

Stealth 5/5- The stealth was excellent. From the outside you wouldn't be able to guess the contents. It did stand out a little from my normal mail but nothing that would seriously raise suspicion. He also uses MBB's which I like. I would say it was a little less creative than Interways stealth(which is the only thing I have to compare to) but it was more than adequate.

1. VirWox - This is an interesting way to get them. This website is a currency trader for Second Life money. Second Life is a sandbox mmo type game which has become a hangout spot for furries and other creepy fetish-type groups. 

VirWox allows you to buy Linden (SL currency) then convert the Linden into BTC and withdrawal from there. Here are the fees for depositing money (can use credit/debit/many other sources):

https://www.virwox.com/deposit.php

Cons- It can take 48 hours to process BTC withdrawal due to security reasons. This to me makes it less than ideal for most purposes. It is still

Here is a decent guide I found on how to get BTC via VirWox:

http://www.scribd.com/doc/110005258/Buy-Bitcoin-via-Paypal-Paysafecard-Credit-Card-Ukash

2. BTCQuick.com - This website allows you to buy 'private keys' and 'Mt Gox redeemable codes.' Both of these can be redeemed on Mt. Gox. I went the private key route and am currently waiting for the confirmations to go through so it'll show up on my Mt. Gox account. Everything worked without a hitch. 

The downside: To use this website you will have to purchase a bronze membership. This costs $1. Not a big deal. You also have to upload a valid ID or utility bill showing you live at your billing address. I just took an iphone picture of my CA driver's license and uploaded it around noon PST. I was verified in &lt;20 minutes. As soon as I was verified a link to my private keys was emailed to me. Pretty painless and quick.

It's basically instant even with the verification. I think the business is so small that the owner can confirm you pretty quickly.

Price: Currently bitcoins are valued at $19.13. I paid $20.62
 on BTCQuick. Not bad at all. 7.78%. They advertised 7.5% over Mt. Gox prices.

So hopefully this guide will help some of you if and when you need to buy BTC with credit card. Overall I would recommend btcQuick over VirWox due to it being faster

We wish to become your EAST COAST suppliers of TOP quality cannabis wares! If you're on the East Coast
We 100% believe in the Escrow system established on SR and since BTC is volatile


--=As of April 17th ALL of our orders are sent securely through using Moisture Barrier Bags (MBBs)=--

We also ship USPS Priority mail ONLY so delivery times are typically between 2-4 days after you order. Our goal is to ship out our orders every day so you can
get yours fast. As buyers

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Why we do this:

We aim to be the most honest vendor on Silk Road. To that extent allow us to open up as to WHY we've decided to take this next step and become a vendor here in the first place.

1. It beats peddling our wares on the street level. (where there's the most risk of getting caught and ending up in jail)

2. We can afford to sell at a lower prices than you could normally get on the street level. BTC is here to stay and we're also active day traders so we leverage our BTC for higher profits on our end!

3. We have dull computer day jobs that don't pay nearly as much as SR. We also don't believe in the war on drugs. We're nerdy rebels with lots of access to cannabis! So with that spirit in mind

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Our Promise:

I have been using SR for over a year now to supply my customers with wares I am unable to source on my own. However


Check us out and if you have any questions for us

Thank you all and happy toking!

I ordered a quarter which thurgood was nice enough to split into an 1/8th of the Purple Kush and 1/8th of the Cherry Diesel.

Communication 5/5: Thurgood has the best communication and response time Ive ever seen. He literally responds to messages over the road faster than my friends respond to text messages. You can also contact him through reddit

Shipping 5/5: Thurgood shipped it Monday and I received it Wednesday to the Midwest. 

Appearance 5/5: My buddy has his green card so Ive been around the block with medical bud and this bud competes at the top. The cherry diesel came in 2 huge dense buds and the purple kush came in about 4-5 medium-large sized buds none of which were compressed at all. All of the bud is beautifully trimmed with perfect moisture content. Both strains are literally covered in trichomes and it is gorgeous! Im almost too scared to touch it because I don't want any to stick to my fingers.

Stealth 5/5: Packaging can't get much better than this. Multiple layers of protection ensures top-notch stealth.

Smell 5/5:  Wow! When I got to the last layer of protection the smell hit me like a truck! I literally had to go outside to transfer the bud into my jars because it was so loud. It's an awesome sweet-fruity smell too. To quote Dale Denton from Pineapple Express I just want to shove it up my nose and have that smell all day. No wonder why Thurgood uses so many layers of protection. 

The High ?/5: Ill be vaping some of it later tonight but lets me honest this bud won't disappoint.

Overall 5/5: Thurgood will be go-to vendor for bud from now. You can't get much better than this.

""I gave a 1/5 because you didn't ship the package and didn't tell me

""That's not what he said. in any case

It would've been nice to resolve your order and extend it for a while to remain in escrow.""

So here is what I think happened: ST started the FE policy to protect himself from scammers and when he got severely backed up for a few days

His response-""Just look at the picture. What you see is what you get.""

Um, blank stamp with no dope visible. How would I be able to gauge:

-How much cut is used?
-How potent the dope is?
-How it compares with other products on SR?
This one is EXTRA important:
-HOW MUCH IS IN EACH STAMP?

A lot of vendors are offering stamps these days;  some of them have 100mg+ of product in them

50x100mg=5 grams
5x50mg=2.50 grams-still a pretty decent price
5x20mg=1 gram-not a good deal at all

I'm just trying to understand why a vendor who is brand new

When you're on the street cold copping, and they know you're still gonna buy.  Even most of my phone connects were short to the point of rudeness-if I had to ask the name of the street we were gonna meet on more than once, they typically lost their shit and accused me of being retarded.

But on SR

This was mostly just a rant, or vendors going out of their way to answer any questions you might have.

Edit: I think it's only fair to mention that he has come around a bit since our first contact.  What I was able to get out of him: he claims he has sampled all of the other stamp vendors on the road, but we'll see. I believe what I'm going to is order a gram from gotsitall, and use my left over BTC to buy a few stamps from him to see what's up.  If it's good and not too light, I will give him a try.

1372449446.0,1h9oyt,(yet another) review of #4 Heroin from FreeWay,opithrowabye,31,5,23,"Sup. I'm back again with another H review for ya'll nigs. 


This time we're going with a name you don't hear very often. FreeWay! 


Every post/review on here seemed to be about problems people had or something. I don't know what others went through but this is my personal experience:


Order: 500mgs of his #4 H. 

----------------------------

Communication 5/5: Prompt communication. He addressed every worry I had and was very chill about everything. What more can you say or ask for?

----------------------------

Stealth/Shipping 4.6/5: Ordered express late monday night, it all worked out. I just needed to have it by friday. Would have preferred it on thursday though) and received on friday. This was a little bit longer than I would have liked but by no means anything unprofessional or unsatisfactory. 


Now for his stealth

------------------------

Quality 5/5!: This was very surprising to me. I expected something good but, I find it to be better than the last shit I had from gotsitall. On par with the shit I got from SUBSRGOOD if you can believe that. The only difference is the legs are slightly shorter but, that might be a testament to my current tolerance more than anything. Quantity is good. I don't have a scale but I wouldn't be surprised if it weighed fat. It looked to my (admittedly with these small quantities, not expert) eye to be around 100mgs fat. 

----------------------------

Overall with subsrgood being gone for now and gotsitall only selling grams I'd say FreeWay is a *very* viable alternative. He deserves a lot more positive press/attention. He doesn't get his fair share on here or on the forums. I'm very happy with my experience and will be back for more. 

9.8/10! 

As always

**Product Quality**  
Hatter is really known for his cold-shoot BTH, his two lowest variations of his cold-shoot BTH include packs of orange needles as well as sterile water.

However, however, placed several orders of his pure oxymorphone.  This product arrives and seems so underwhelming.  But you take a little nick and snort it, had me nodding a bit and all energized, so i went for one of the nicest evening bike rides in awhile.

I also recently ordered his NEW fentanyl nasal spray (50 variety). With my tolerance, and hatter even offers links to the lab tests performed on the raw materials.  amazing!

**Service/Shipping and Stealth**  
Prior to this week, has since toned that down and pretty much only ships mon-thurs, putting orders from friday morning out as well sometimes (see his page for more details on this). Not a big deal if you keep this in mind when ordering. Anyway, on the days he ships, he is prompt and doesn't delay.  Your stuff goes out pretty damn fast.

One of my favorite things about hatter is his stealth.  I won't speak to it specifically

**Communication**  
Because I found PGP easy and all that, he wrote back eagerly, even putting in some of his own feedback. He was more than willing to discuss his products and best practices as well as harm reduction.  A total class act when it comes to customer service. 

**Final Rating**^1  
Hatter26 is without a doubt a 5 star vendor (more on this below) and I thoroughly recommend him to all potential buyers.  You really can't go wrong for all the reasons mentioned above. He doesn't pressure you for FE or any such nonsense and the experience is comfortable and easy from start to finish. I will be back for more

Pretty good bud for the price, very sticky and dense buds. Great strong, soaring high. Can still leave you calm and relaxed, tired even, but not foggy at all. 

Overall very satisfied with the transaction. Will probably order one of their indoor hydro indica strains next.

Here to report on Tess's new WoW. I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Man does Tessellated need some applause. I just came out of a beautiful journey

I've been interested in SR for a few months now. I lurked and did plenty of research, and I waited to spend on the perfect first purchase - and I'm happy I did because they nearly doubled in value and I got to buy twice what I originally hoped to! Toward the end when it came time to finally buy, it was between Tess and LD, and I'm incredibly happy with what I chose.

It shipped incredibly fast. I ordered on a Friday night

I set aside a Friday afternoon for the trip. Prepped everything in advance, they were an incredibly wonderful sitter to have. They are another half to me I have come to appreciate beyond this existence, and sharing this experience with them was powerful.

But now to the good stuff! I took ONE TAB. Just one little tab! And shit got bonkers fast.

I started my trip at about 3:15PM by watching Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World and coloring with crayons on my bed. That movie is a trip in and of itself

The first visuals came exactly an hour in at 4:15PM. There were drastic color changes in the blanket I was sitting on

My partner came into the room and asked if I was ready for dinner. I was nearing the end of the movie (the last hour had flown by, but I was pretty certain the sensation in my gut area was in fact hunger. I ate two clementines during the movie, and while they were an incredible experience to eat, they hadn't filled me up.

My partner began to make us veggie tacos in the kitchen. While the movie was wrapping up

The movie finished, I was like a child with ADHD. My partner asked me to grab a few ingredients, of which I found one or two and then moved on to another task, I believe washing dishes. I ambled around the kitchen as my partner flew around me: chopping, stirring, and pouring in a fast flurry - or so it felt. I succumbed to simply stirring the sautéing vegetables. Man, did being over that pan smell fucking great. I stupidly stirred the vegetable as the pan underneath shrunk and grew and shrunk and grew. My partner put on the soundtrack for the video game FEZ

Eventually we were situated at the dinner table; the plateau of my trip was in full swing by this point. Eating the tacos was an experience out of this world. Every sense was stimulated as I chewed away. It was incredibly spicy, he was the wise old king of our apartment, overseeing his the people of his land.

Within an instant the dishes were done, simply listening to my headphones and staring out the window at the trees and planes flying overhead.

I could tell that I was starting to come down around 7PM, bleaching in the sun after begin tossed at sea for eternity. You simply bask in the duality of all things, completely saturated and entirely wrung out all at once.

My partner wrapped up some work and I ended my music session. They started to play Mass Effect, most notably space given the game they were playing.

After an hour or so my partner offered to have sex, we spoke in depth about how our existence as humans on this earth were incredibly fulfilling with one another, and looked forward to millennia in the future when perhaps our energy will join together in another star or planet unknown to us now.

The night waned, and muscles remained, but I was easily able to fall asleep around 12AM. 

It was a wonderful night all in all, and really lay out on the beach of the universe. Thank you very much Tessellated for your work, time, and effort placed into this venture. I am incredibly grateful for this vacation you have provided me with.",,False,,1363062238.0,t3_1a4o86

The shipping took roughly a week or a week and a half; I don't remember the exact dates but I do remember opening my mailbox and finding the package only to question what in the hell it could be because I didn't think there was any way on Earth the product could have arrived to the US so fast. But lo and behold there it was, right ;) ). I found myself smiling from ear to ear as I unwrapped it and looked for my treasure buried within; I even took a picture to commemorate the moment.

The product itself left me speechless... literally. Never have I ever rolled so hard in my life. Only a small dose was needed of the beautiful white powder, a new tingle was introduced and an appreciation for the chaos overcame me. I closed my eyes and let the euphoria take me away as I danced into the night with strangers surrounding me. I loved them, and they loved me, and it was magical. And I owe this amazing experience to MDUK.

This guy is the real deal; he's hands down one of the friendliest vendors I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with and his presence on Reddit made things even better and made me much more comfortable and trusting. He's extremely knowledgeable on his product and the on the business he does. I hope he plans on sticking around for awhile as I will be a returning customer.

I did receive my order from greendaddy888 after it being in transit for almost a week. I believe that this package was marked in transit before he actually posted it.    

Quality: 1/5 Looks correct, one each method, and did feel slightly different, but different is the most generous description I can give. I also provided samples for two friends who's ROA was IV, and they both reported feeling a very weak something, while they both said that they were able to feel something it was not anything they would pay any amount of money for. They didn't have any interest in purchasing them for $5    

Quantity: 5/5 The vendor included the correct quantity of the product ordered, but both items were bunk as well. I was expecting one more ""brand"" of the 30s, while I realize that these are bootlegged the vendor stated that they had 3 different types, and only 2 were included 7 of the K 9, and 3 of the V- 48 12, non of the a-215's.    

Stealth: 1/5 Down right unsafe! With out providing any details that would make the situation an more unsafe

Speed: 4/5 Paid for priority
I have not released the funds yet, as the package did arrive, but the product was not as described.
    

TL;DR: Do not order

OK just wrote a report on my transaction with this vendor.  I've been wanting to write about my experience for a while.  I took 1 Gandalf last night (reported by vendor at 150mcg

I have been seeking a certain altered state for a long time now.  I'd been filling this craving with weed and alcohol

Since finding SR I had some trouble finding a good domestic LSD vendor, or if maybe I was looking for something that psychedelics weren't going to give me.  

Finally took the plunge and ordered a 25 strip from JC.  I wanted to take one the day I got them I was so excited

At about 5:45 I was at home depot when I knew I felt different.  Not quite tripping

Finally got home.  Then started tripping.  Looked at the clock, thinking about doing something, then changing my mind, then just being wrapped up in thought for a minute.

When I really started coming up at about 6:30, and boom, I was happy.  I put on some Adventure Time and let me say that show is so great on acid.  Laughed for a long time.

At around this time I took my dogs on a walk around the hood.  The day was a little gloomy with rain but the walk was still fun.  Wasn't anxious or weird

I think the first peak was about 2 hours in.  I had gotten home and was sitting watching Adventure Time and I knew I was full on tripping.  There were some key things I recalled from LSD as a youth, dirty feeling, weird taste/smell.  I kept looking for these as I almost thought these should be indicative of good acid.  But now I realize that those are indicative of lesser quality acid.  I had none or very little of these symptoms, but the quality of my visuals and mood were stellar, better than the stuff I had had before.  This was definitely some quality clean stuff.

It got very intense at some points.  Especially when I decided to try doing some yoga.  I put on a yoga video I do often.  I noticed that the video looked all blurry like the colors were bleeding together.  It literally looked like something was wrong with the screen.  I highly recommend yoga or some type of physical activity with this.  I think it got my blood going

Let me talk about the visuals.  I always hear people rave about it, I cant really recall in vivid detail.  Not that they looked like they were really there, it was more like I was watching my imagination summon up these things, but it was incredibly interesting to just sit and watch.  

These figures would then morph into rippling patterns that would spin together, then spin again.  It was awesome.

Staring at adventure time on my big screen was mind numbing.  At moments I realized I was just staring wide eyed and slack jawed with a big grin at the colors on the screen.

Spent some time writing in a journal.  Started heading down very interesting avenues of thought that then folded back upon themselves, like there was the base thought process, then a metaphysical thought process, and a self-conscious one, etc, all kind of flowing together.  I kept telling myself to write more so I would remember, I felt an urgency to remember these things I was thinking.  

Man, then I knew I was coming down, but it was a very gradual come down and would kick in again.  No bad feelings on the come down, I realized it felt quite pleasant to be coming back to earth but still had incredible visuals.  

Finally got to sleep at about 7 and woke up at 11.  I feel great.  Went for a 3 mile run and the day is beautiful.  I feel incredible and happy.  This is what I had been seeking for so long.  Even in the past my memories of acid were that it was fun but had moments of discomfort both physical and mental

When I was tripping I thought I can't wait to get to do this again.  When I woke up today I felt a little tired mentally and knew I would need a break.  But now after my run I'm honestly ready to go again lol.  I won't of course,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,t3_1a1emo

I've been buying for a while and though this may help some noobs looking for OXy.  I only buy domestic with one exception. Here's my favorites (and not so favorites).



Oxy



Drxtc - Only Canadian vendor I buy from. The shipping and processing can take just a sec because it's going through customs, usually with bonuses. He is my go-to man unless I'm in a time crunch or he's out of my favorite stock. Don't be fooled by his blemished rating. I read it and it had to do with precursors. Personally, I don't even know wtf they are. For Oxy, he's on point. Sometimes slow on communication because he's slammed... But there's really nothing I need to communicate about.



Supersun - Far and away, I am sure hitting him up. Slow on communication because he's a busy dude... But that really doesn't matter to me... He's lightening on delivery.



NorcoCo - Super reliable. Average prices, but he can save you from being dope sick with some of his other selections. Far and away the best communication on the road... Timely, flawless grammar, funny, and kind.



Costco - expensive! But, I head to CostCo. 



Pill City - totally worth throwing him a nod, super fast delivery, wonderful stealth. He's out of stock at the moment.



And here are two vendors I had nasty experiences with...



Blumangroup - never arrived



Fastforward - never arrived. Provided DCN showing delivered... But never received. I have a locked mailbox so theft is non-issue. I released funds and left positive review since he provided confirmed DCN. However



Benzos



Natasha - fast shipping



NorcoCo - Same deal as above. He's the man.



TheRealRickGrimes - what an awesome product (sour patch kids). I just ordered so I don't know anything more yet... But I am just fascinated by the product. Great prices too and amazing reviews

1370189906.0,1fivtl,Vendor Review: Thurgood Jenkins,SilkRoadGuru,31,10,9,"Please read this in its entirety to get a full grasp.

Product: Custom listing for 2 OZ of G13

I was looking for a vendor that had a 2oz listing up on this subreddit, I sent TJ a message asking for an update on my order. He responded in reasonable time to tell me that he had run out of stock on the Purple Kush and that he wouldnt be getting any in for a couple days. He apologies profusely and offered me compensation for the wait, which I was very surprised at but gratefully accepted it. TJ told me he could send my order out on Friday or Saturday of the week and I told him to wait til Tuesday as I was not trying to let that package sit somewhere over the holiday weekend when there was no post. He agreed and sent it out once the post was open again. Shipping took a mere two days and was surprised when the mailman got out of his truck to hand me my package while I was washing my car. At first I was confused by the packaging, it was not the normal packaging you would get for a 2oz listing so I wasnt sure what it was. After going inside I inspected the package for damage or smell, there was none. However there was a slight problem with the packaging that gave me the ""willies"" but after looking at it for a second as if I were LE, I realized there was no way it could have gave anything away. After opening the package, the stealth was top notch and no smell was emanating until the last bag was cut open.  

Lets move on to the bud, although you could tell that this plant was VERY healthy while it grew. After trimming only the excess stems off the buds, I was left with ~1.4 grams of stems. I didnt mind because TJ did compensate me for the lateness of the package, which was more than 1.4 grams so all is good, but if I could recommend that perhaps trimming some of the excess stems off in the future, it would be awesome. Then again it could just be the strain as I have only had G-13 once before and it was already ground up in my buddies grinder. Other than the stems the bud looks unbelievable, some purple from where you can tell the bud was grown in a lower temperature of the Colorado environment and it was covered in crystals. It immediately stunk up my entire house to where I had to open the window in the room I was in just to get some fresh air in! After loading a pack into my trusty ""waterpipe"", yes it was literally just once huge bud

Overall: I was very pleased at the price, and responsiveness of TJ. He is going to make a name for himself on SR and here is to him being able to handle it. He reminds me of the early NorthWestDirect before he got big and had trouble completing orders that were pouring in.

Employees involved in contract tendering and business arrangements with contractors that accept, process, transport, deliver mail or could have access to the mail (such as a custodian or tradesperson) must ensure that the contracts have necessary provisions and clauses for protection of the mail while it is in the care of the contractor as detailed in the 'Planning for Security in Contracting' practice. It covers all hardcopy and electronic mail, information

I found FG through someone searching for discount ounces of marijuana. I was completely stunned that a vendor would provide a $165 ounce of bud that *wasn't* reggie or mids. So I saved up a bit of cash, only to find that the listing for his Small Bud Mix wasn't up. I messaged him asking when it would be back up. He responded maybe 20 minutes later saying that it would be soon, but in the meantime, he had thrown together a custom listing, just for me! I was impressed to say the least, especially since I would have been just fine waiting for the SBM to come back up. So I placed the order, it was marked in transit several days later (not right after

Here's the first mistake on my part: I went on vacation. This meant I had to place my mail on hold (all my neighbors weren't able to watch the mail). I was gone for a little under a week. I came back, and was thoroughly happy.

The packaging was very nice. The box was taped up securely, rained on, or beat to death, and my product would have been fine.

The stealth was pretty standard. A postal employee who had any suspicion probably could have discovered my product

The product was excellent, was cured perfectly, and only had a very small amount of shake and stems in the bottom of the bag. And let me tell you, FG made up for those stems with flying colors. What was maybe a gram of stems total, was made up for by a good 5 grams or so of extra bud. The bag was *very* fat to say the least.


**tl;dr**

**Communication**: 5/5 responded very quickly to all questions

**Packaging**: 5/5 very sturdy and wholesome

**Stealth**: 5/5 no chance of any doggies finding my goods

**Product**: 7/5 very fat bag

In the planning of my birthday weekend I decided to make a purchase. I was not in the market to buy a large amount

I ordered 2 grams of his mdma. It was mostly crystals with very little fine powder. It look, and he threw in an orange triforce pressed pill for shits. Both nice surprises, and much appreciated.

Last weekend finally rolled around. The Saturday when the festivities were planned had an interesting start. My friend and I drove down to new Orleans. Mid trip I noticed my iPhone wouldn't charge. Great, which caused me to swerve into a curb to avoid him. Driver side tire went out and he sped off. I was consumed with anger, and almost called the police. Obviously, I decided that wouldn't be the best decision of my life. So here I was. Stuck in the middle of a major street in new Orleans at the hottest part of the day with a flat tire. Happy birthday to me.

Luckily my cousin and his friends met us. One of them was a mechanic and had the spare on in no time. Needless to say his first few rounds were on me. Fast forward a few hours and we were at a pub crawl. For those who don't know, then stop at a pub and drink. Rinse and repeat for 6 miles. It was hot, sweaty, but we had a good time. Around 7 my friend and I headed to the hotel and prepared ourselves for the reason we came: Krewella.

Once in our hotel we smoked a good bit, so we headed down around 8:45. We got in a rather long line. I had 4 150mg caps, and 2 100mg. 2 150mg were for my friend and I, as well as the 100mg should we want a booster. The other 2 were to sell. Behind us 3 girls and a guy get in line. Call the girls A,B, and P, and the guy shady motherfucker. We end up all talking while we are waiting. Guy asked if we had extra. So I sold him my 2 extra for 40. One was for him, but drug experience ever. I told her it's the best stuff in the building, and ring pops. This isn't my first rodeo.

20 minutes later we walk are about to walk in the club. I turned around and she had a huge smile on her face. I said you took it already didn't you? Her eyes got big, I feel great!"" Oh honey, just you wait. B and I started to hit it off some. I bought her a beer and myself a water and we head into the fastly growing crowd. This is when I dropped my first 150mg as well as my friend. We all started dancing in a group. B turned out to be an amazing dancer. We had fun for awhile. My friend was with p, and shady mfer was with A. I felt the comeup. It was fucking strong. I got good energy and was throwing down to some dubstep and trap. I felt great.

It was roughly 150 degrees in there. The floor was covered in a flash flood quality pool of sweat and other bodily fluids. I was a sweaty wreck. We all were, so I told A I would be back in a few. I got some water and headed outside. That would be the last time I saw her that night, which 
had me bummed.

To pick up the pace of this story I was outside for 20 minutes and felt glorious. Almost everyone outside was there for the same reason so everyone was talking and having fun. I rolled back in pun intended feeling refreshed and amazing. Time to hit that dance floor again. I met some more people, so we had a blast.

1366572155.0,1ctcdn,SilkRoad Vendor Review of Canadaflag Strains,RickyStinky,28,10,5,"Ive been reading online about a ""gem"" of a vendor called Canadaflag. His prices are some of the cheapest Ive ever seen. $120-$200 for an ounce. 

I must say

$6.5/gram for kushage. Whats kushage? Its an OK strain that Ive had in the past. Canadaflag's kushage is about as good as any other Ive had. But his price for kushage is cheap. I would say its worth $9-$12/gram. So at $6.5/gram its cheap. But Im not a fan of the strain in general. Grade: B+

$7/gram for Blue Rhino. Talk about BAG APPEAL. These are chunky

Chemdog $7.5/gram if you buy an ounce. (for an ounce $210) Sells samples for $9.75/gram. Every vendor is known for something they sell. For Canadaflag its all about the Chemdog.  His chemdog is PREMIUM. I bought 2 grams of it. And I jarred it in a small glass jar I got from the dollar store. I opened the jar at my buddys house and it STUNK the house up. You could smell it from upstairs lol. An amazing citrus smell. This one strain is light years ahead of anything else he sells. I would go further to say its probably some of the best chemdog I have ever had. Wicked high. Very potent head high. Racing

First order came to one of the SE states in 6 days, you'll immediately know where it is. But I don't think any unsuspecting person would have reason to open the letter at all. My orders also had different return addresses so at the very least he cycles a few and likely changes the whole pool from time to time.

Now, he offered me a 50% refund or a reship with the next order. Little thinking, I ordered another 10 strip and come home today to a 4x5 piece of delicious white tabs waiting in the mailbox. One problem is that I won't try them for two or three weeks from now - but from what I hear they are top notch and exactly what they were advertised as.

Hey r/LSD, around 4:30 I began feeling extremely nauseated--wet mouth, hot flashes, very upset stomach. I sat down and tried to breathe deeply, but I soon began to vomit. After about 2 minutes of puking, I felt a lot better. Then, after about 30 minutes and a number of hallucinatory observations, I felt much better. I waited another 20 minutes, indeed, journaled etc. but nowhere near what I thought I would experience. I kept telling myself that I needed to ""just accept my LSD experience and not force any kind of trip based on what I had heard from others."" I am no longer nauseated


Beyond all of this, told me that he wasn't sure why his bag said CB, and promised me that my bag was marked with a ""40"" because it contained 40 milligrams. I asked him why it was not measured in micrograms, and he told me that he wasn't sure. But he definitely did not seem confident in his response, whatsoever. Now, I have converted milligrams to micrograms, yes,000 micrograms


My friend has not dropped yet because he was planning on doing so tonight. I am going to warn him about my vomiting, so I might be wrong--I do not want him to possibly overdose on the same drug.


For those who respond, I have had terrible worries and very weird dreams about the order, but I assured myself that my friend would never intentionally fuck me over.


Please let me know what you guys think. I'm fine now


Thanks


Edit: I don't know how to condense this into a TL;DR

To everyone who responded, which is what was written on my bag. Thank you for helping me though, everyone. After ""my friend"" gives me money back, I do not plan on communicating with him ever again.

&gt; Hidden services such as are popular

How he knows:

&gt; Any one can set up a Tor node (HSDir) and begin logging all hidden service descriptors published to their node. They will also receive all client requests allowing them to observe the number of look-ups for particular hidden services.

Relevant to recent SR downtime:

&gt; The list of responsible HSDir’s for a hidden service is based on the calculated descriptor ID and an ordered list of HSDir fingerprints. As the descriptor ID’s are predictable

The per-onion traffic:

&gt; The following table contains data on requests my nodes received for some well known Tor based marketplaces. There are also requests for related phishing sites. I have confirmed that some users were directed to these phishing pages from links on the “The Hidden Wiki” (.onion). The number of requests is what my nodes observed.

So, he kept messaging me to change the feedback and I said I wasn't going to since I didn't receive anything and I felt scammed. When he finally gave me the tracking #, it had already expired. His response was basically that he wouldn't scam someone since he doesn't care about the $150 profit he would have made and I ""need to change it (the feedback) if he is going to continue to work out of escrow with me."" After a lot of back and forth, he accused me of being spiteful because I said I wouldn't change the feedback until any real solutions were proposed. He then asked for my address for a reship and I asked for only half a reship because I wanted to be fair about the situation...

Before I even gave him my address again, I would never order from him again after this huge hassle. He was really unprofessional in his messages and in the end, I just really wanted him to leave me alone because without actually coming up with solutions, he just kept badgering me to change the feedback.

I got it with express shipping because I was running out. 

About an hour after I ordered I noticed he took down his listing but it didn't really worry me.

What about the hedging system itself...how well could it withstand the BTC losing much of its value? They get revenue not only through the hedging fee (4% if I recall)

This time it is of this stellar vendor Fivestar!

Lets fire into it. Tierra del fuego!


------------------------------


Communication 8/5

They fucking earned that 8. Communication is beyond any vendor I've ever dealt with before. Fuck its beyond any merchant I've ever dealt with before, and cares about their customers. Hands down the friendliest and most caring vendor I've ever come in contact with and I don't state that lightly. 


--------------------------


Shipping 6/5

I don't know if I got lucky


---------------------------


Stealth 5/5

Again above and beyond the call of duty on this one. Weak in one area but for very good reasons. Strong as fuck in others. Without giving anything away it was packaged very very well with good cover and used the stealth that everyone should use but many don't. You should be aware of what I'm talking about. No one other gram vendors use the technology that Fivestar employs in their stealth even though they should be. I've very thankful for that.


-----------------------


Quantity/Quality 5/5

What can I say? It was a beautiful white powder with small clumps that broke up easily. Very high quality. Smell and taste was right on par and the quantity seemed fat even though its hard for me to tell. Right on point. Quality is high enough for me to prefer it to other vendors especially when you take into account how amazing Fivestar is as a vendor and the good pricing. 


---------------------------------


All in all Fivestar went far beyond what I expected. 


For the price you simply can't beat someone providing service at this level. I've now tried every gram vendor I'm going to try (read back through my history for other reviews) and I've found my true go-to. I might go for others when I feel adventurous but I'm confident Fivestar is going to treat me with respect and value me as a customer in ways that other vendor simply do not. And honestly in this game that is the most important thing you can ask for beyond getting your product and having it be as described. 


----------------------------

**EDIT GOT SOME PICS!**

that is freeway (not totally chopped up yet) on the right and fivestar on the left


you can see everything fairly clearly if you zoom in on the second pic. All those little chunks in fivestars were just moist nuggets of powder the broke apart effortlessly and finely.

Shipping

I originally placed an order when i first saw the post but never received it.  I messaged MushBud and he promptly sent out another batch.  It arrived 6 days later.  The package was good and it's contents  would never be discovered unless opened up.  My only complaint is the lack of a return address



Communication

Mushbud always replied in a very timely manner and was great at answering some questions i had as well as some tips on taking them



Product

As i said before, but just never got around to trying shrooms.  We both did a lemon tek with my GF taking 2g and me taking 2.3g.  We also made some ginger tea with it and experienced very little stomach discomfort, which only lasted around 30 minutes.  I'm sure most of you know the effects of shrooms, so i wont go into it too much, however the product was top notch and loved every second of my first experience with them.  I will be checking out MushBud again in the future and was a very happy customer.",,False,t5_2sidu,True

1372346505.0,1h6l28,Vendor review: Rabbithole (mushroom maple candy... mmmm),hashdude,20,3,13,"I love giving new vendors a try

Being Canadian I love maple anything

The product is very well packaged and I have no doubts the shipping will satisfy even the most paranoid.  The taste is actually quite good and it's the first time my gag reflex didn't kick in while chewing shrooms.  I could definitely taste mushrooms in a few bites of the candy but it wasn't bad at all.  The earthyness of the shrooms mixed quite well with the earthyness of the maple - it was a great mix.  Most importantly

The trip is as described and for my first time out I decided to try 1 candy (1g).  They describe one candy as: Colours seem brighter; some tingling of tongue and fingers; deep breaths, not too strong, buzz that seemed to enhance everything (as mushrooms do).  My sweet spot is probably 1.5 - 2 candies but I really enjoyed the effects of 1.  The vendor is committed to consistency of dose so you shouldn't have wild fluctuations in potency between candies.  I prefer this as I've had potency vary greatly between mushrooms in the past.

I asked the vendor to put a sample pack order up since not everyone will try the product out if they have to order a dozen so look out for the 4-candy pack soon.

**TL;DR: I love mushrooms but hate the taste.  [Rabbithole](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/12f29c0c43) is providing a super tasty delivery vehicle for one of my favourite psychedelics.

**Shipping**: he had some slight issues getting my order shipped out (took about three days to get it marked in transit) but he mentioned these issues on his vendor page and I never felt in the dark at all. I received my product within 5 days of placing the order anyway

**Stealth** was slightly sub par

and most importantly

I **DID NOT** reagent test his acid (as apparently blotter paper can fuck with reagent tests)

The onset took about 45 minutes

The entire trip lasted 8-9 hours

The ug amounts he claimed (100ug) seems on par compared to other LSD I have taken in the past. One of his tabs felt about as strong as two tabs I have purchased locally.

There were no strange or unexpected tastes in my mouth. There was no taste at all

There was no tongue/mouth numbing associated with NBOMe's.

All in all, but this was LSD and quality LSD at that. With a single tab I had a very pleasant, moderately visual trip.

Shipping: (9/10) - Absolutely awesome stealth. Shipped through priority which ended up taking 4 days but I'm not gonna knock Ava (the vendor) for the speed of usps.

Smell: (9/10) - Extremely unique

Appearance: (10/10) - This is where Ava really shines. I'll post pictures below for emphasis. Some of the most interesting and fluffy looking bud I've ever seen.

Taste: (8/10) - The taste, but I understand that it isn't for everybody. It isn't a notable downside by any means, still good smoke.

The high: (10/10) - The Lebowski is one of the most enjoyable highs I've come across in a long long time. Extremely mellow and not paranoid or overpowering in any way. As she describes it, both of these deliver unique highs not found with your everyday dealer.

Vendor:

In terms of my shipping. Everything I do is with my own safety and the buyer's safety in mind. I don't take shortcuts. I have switched to handwritten Express labels for this exact reason. I get a ton of emails from people suggesting I use printed ones - I used to do this until I realized it puts the BUYER in jeopardy. I grow quite tired of this suggestion and I'm going to explain why. While you might think handwritten labels are amateurish - they are the safest form of shipping for the buyer.

Let me tell you a quick story- On my first run of H stamps I had one desperate buyer whose Express shipment took 2 days. He is always a 2-day Express as he lives in a very small town and I priced it out prior to shipment and informed him of that. The next day I log in to see 33 emails from him. He is sick, accusing me of not shipping, threatening me, etc etc etc. So I caved and gave him his tracking number. Then I log-in to another 20+ emails. He has called USPS a dozen or so times, he went to his local PO since the online tracking didn't show where it was, and he spoke to his local courier when he came to his door. The amount of times he contacted and stalked USPS scared me. I then realized that any electronic postage system - usps.com, stamps.com

Now mind you- my return address is totally stealth. I pay for postage using prepaid cards from a different state

1370996235.0,1g5tkn,"My experience thus far with a new vendor: Silo ""25c-NBOME""",iphonehackr2013,22,6,41,"I just had to write up this amazing experience I had with a very new vendor on a very new substance that I never had even heard of!

* **Product Quality**
This is by far the most important so ill start with this. I don't have a previous experience to compare against but I can say that this exceeded all my expectations that arose from the vast amount of research I did on this drug. I can say this with certainty it was far more euphoric, and much more visual stunning then the vast amounts of LSD I've done in my lifetime. The blotter art it came on was really really cool as well. Trip lasted about 4-5 hours and only took about 30 minutes before I felt effects.
* **Stealth/ Packaging**
Perfect. Definitely don't have to worry if ordering domestic/ internationally. Took 2 days from being marked in transit to Midwest.
* **Communication/ Customer Service**
Let me share my story. This was my first purchase out of two with vendor. This experience started by me reading an article about 25c-Nbome and instantly I became intrigued by this relatively new substance. I did a search on SR and saw this vendor offering a 5 tab sample for $1.05 including free shipping. My bitcoins were absolutely depleted and due to my current goto guy from localbitcoins being out I was going to have to wait a week or so before getting more. I wrote Silo and asked him if he could waive the $1.05 so I could get to try sooner. In complete disbelief a half hour later I saw a message and $1.05 in my account haha. He ha actually sent me the money to buy the sample from him! Lol I felt like a bum but wow I never seen a vendor do that! In his message he informed me his ""family"" has been selling this chemical for years and sold hundreds of thousands of tabs over the years and now trying their luck at selling on the Silk Road. He also stated that he's giving out samples because he knows once people sample his product he was certain he would make customers for life! He was right!! I only wish he had more products but supposedly he's working on that as well! Xanax bars, weed, and MDMA I wouldn't bother going through anyone else. I asked a few more questions in another message and he responded with an hour. Extremely polite and makes you feel like your his number one priority!!

* **Overall**
This guy will be goto guy for anything he sells that I use. 25c-NBOME is not a substance I would use very often that's why I hope he comes with new products soon. I say if you like Xanax definitely keep an eye on Silo when he finally offers his bars knowing him he'll probably be giving out free samples or ridiculously low prices so become a fan now! Also he still has the samples for 25c for $1.05 get over there quick and order yours!",,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1g5tkn/my_experience_thus_far_with_a_new_vendor_silo/

IT'S called Silk Road and it's one of the internet's most secretive destinations.

It is an online black market for illicit drugs like ecstasy and cocaine that is the scourge of law enforcement and Customs.

Silk Road is a shadowy website with an often shadowy clientele. But Dr Philip Nitschke
Exit International

Dr Nitschke said his organisation published the guide because a Customs crackdown on euthanasia medication entering the country was causing many supporters to lose their money on seized medication.

Customs figures show the number of detections of euthanasia drugs such as Nembutal (which contains the barbiturate pentobarbitone) has tripled in the past three years

""They might be 80-year-olds, adding that his more sophisticated strategies may help patients save their money.

The guide is necessary as the Silk Road requires significant technical expertise to access. It can only be reached using special software

Silk Road, not global currencies like Australian dollars.

A spokesman for the Customs and Border Protection Service said buyers and sellers of any illegal products online or on the Silk Road risk prosecution - and run the real risk of being scammed as well.

Silk Road

The Silk Road website is better known as an encrypted destination for purchasing illicit drugs like cannabis and ecstasy. Source: news.com.au
The agency said it was working in collaboration with local and international law enforcement partners as part of a global intelligence network to clamp down on buyers and sellers of drugs on anonymous websites such as Silk Road.

""Intelligence gathered by Customs and Border Protection and commentary made by buyers and sellers in online forums suggests that this disruption activity is having an adverse effect on the degree of the trust between buyers and sellers within Silk Road.""

""Customs and Border Protection has noted an increasing trend on Silk Road

Dr Nitschke's Silk Road manual is just the latest in a string of controversial attempts to assist people with medically-assisted suicide.
The medical regulator

The doctor runs Max Dog Brewers

The anti-euthanasia group Hope has complained about his promotion and sale of nitrogen

""I think there's a significant public policy around the activities of Exit International

Euthanasia is illegal in Australia. Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings and Tasmanian Greens leader Nick McKim have introduced a proposal to legalise ""voluntary assisted dying"" in the island state.

It will likely be voted on later this year

Euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory between 1995 and 1997

1348163249.0,107ask,Couple thoughts on PO boxes,goldbrick_homeboy,16,1,24,"I see a lot of apathy towards PO Boxes here and in the forums. Most people are of the opinion why bother setting up a PO box if it doesn't get you significantly more security? To get a PO box you have to produce a non-trivial amount of identification

I originally got a PO box because it made me feel warm and fuzzy and ""safer"" in some impossible to define way. I now can see some real advantages over home delivery. 

First of all the danger of controlled delivery. How do they do a controlled delivery to a PO box? They hold it at the desk and wait for me to come get it? I can simply not pick it up. Are they really going to stake out the PO and wait for me to come check my box? I wouldn't think LEOs would waste that sort of manpower on a small timer like you or I (I could be wrong). 

Ease of changing address is another big advantage. Let's just say I have 50 grams of MDMA coming in from the Netherlands and it's intercepted. Well now they're going to be watching my mail. There's no need to worry if it's safe to order to my PO box. I can just stop paying the bills and go open one at another post office. 

There's also the matter of separation. If I only have ""bad"" stuff delivered to my PO Box and legit stuff delivered to my home

Of course the biggest drawback of a PO box (IMO) is that when a shipment comes in I have to drive it home. So there's definitely risk there.

1375641346.0,1jox05,[Vendor Review and Experience] Aidoneus MDMA Capsules,_Boobz_,20,6,10,"Holy balls. First experience with MDMA and first purchase off the Silk Road

**SHIPPING and PRICING**

Ordered (10) 140mg capsules of Aideoneus's ""84% pure"" MDMA this past Monday at 11:00pm. Package was marked ""In Transit"" on Tuesday and arrived in my mailbox on Thursday afternoon, and/or fake MDMA in my area ($20/pill), that's a good deal and Aidoneus's reviews and consistently high feedback instill a lot of confidence as a buyer vs. the shady street guys.

**THE TEST and COME-UP**

Marquis reagent test showed deep purplish black results. I later learned that you should perform multiple types of tests on a sample to get an exact confirmation of MDMA. My bad. I'm still learning. We finished dinner, the come-up fully launches me into the experience and I immediately put the computer down, totally overwhelmed with body high and euphoria. I've never been high like that before and asked my SO to hold me while I crawled into his lap. No negative feelings or scariness, just overwhelming sensation and the need to equilibrate. We decided we wanted room to just lay and spread out, so we moved to the bedroom. Walking there, the wooziness made me feel nauseous and I almost threw up a little in my mouth. Made it to the bed and took a few deep breaths and things were okay again. I'm a 5'7"" 135lb female and 140mg is on the higher end of a ""strong dose"" - maybe next time I'll empty out a tiny bit of powder from my capsule.

**THE EUPHORIC HIGH**

During the peak - [see this chart from Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_effects.shtml) - I was fucking out of my mind. Every touch, overwhelming. I lost track of time. I was spinning and closing my eyes felt good. We had made a play list, but I don't know that I even heard the music. I remember heat and touch and soft lips and his skin. I have no clue how people go to EDM shows and function IRL on this drug. I was high as fuck and it was delicious.

**THE COME-DOWN**

I'm not sure when it happened

**THE NEXT DAY**

Woke up feeling a bit groggy at 10:00am. A little shitty. But after a shower and some cereal, mess in the garden, and enjoy a normal lazy Sunday. I'm glad it's not going to wipe out my whole weekend. At the advise of a friend, we took some 5-HTP yesterday afternoon well before rolling. I'm not sure if that helps your body out, but figured it couldn't hurt. 

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I am terrifically pleased and impressed with Aidoneus's shipping and product. Seems like a stand-up vendor and as a noob drug user at 27 years old with a lot of preconceived fears about exploring that world, stealthy shipping, pure and delightful product, and no terrible hangover.

I see some people on here have had bad experiences with us, but as it turns out, auto-trim is not the best for extraction. The manufacturer of our machines, pointed out that due to auto-trim being of much finer and smaller material than just hand trimmed product, even a single butane pass will cause the oil to come out a lot darker, and with more of an elastic consistency than desired.  We are at the very tail end of our batch of auto-trim and have gone on a special business trip to contact some of the nicest and greatest farmers on the west side, to inspect their product and ensure that they only hand trim everything. We will be changing our listings as soon as we begin processing this new product

The second problem that we only extremely recently figured out was the issue with ""sizzling"". I have sat with at our machines for several hours, but our main oil guy is or I would have figured this out a lot earlier. The oil that comes directly out of our vac oven has absolutely no sizzle to it, the sizzle comes from our packaging process! Due to the oily nature of our current product, we do all of our weighing and packaging in a freezer, which allows a small amount of water condensation to collect on/in the oil. That water, when smoked, will quickly boil and evaporate

In summation, which should also reduce our having to work with the stuff in a freezer, which will eliminate any of the sizzling that everyone seems to be experiencing :) Now if anybody has any complaints about the the high they get from our product, I have no answers for you, since 99.7 percent of our customer base seems to be very happy :)

1372514659.0,1hb6ga,Tessellated review and trip report!(WARNING: LONG),imthebestmaynesr,21,8,6,"So, I have set out on a quest. I'm gonna try a bunch of things I've always wanted to. LSD is something I've wanted to try for many years

I ordered a 5 strip of Tessellated's 200mic LSD late on a Tuesday night. Friday morning, he/she sent me a message saying not to worry and my order would ship out before the weekend. And so it did, indeed! 


The package came on Wednesday, the product is also not readily visible and I can see why some people are confused by it. 


I waited til Friday night to dose, occasionally chewing it. For the next 15 minutes I began to wonder if what I got was bullshit. See, I've never even *seen* blotters in person so I actually didn't know if I was being duped. I now think this may have been the very beginnings of the psychological effects of this particular drug, but I can't be sure. I get a phone call from the friend of mine who was supposed to trip with me, and he's coming to pick me up. For this story, I'll call him Robert. While I wait for Robert, I lay in bed with the lights off. I start noticing that the crack of light from my door is changing colors very slowly. The small LED on the back of my computer, is blinking red and blue and purple. Ah, even though the TV appears to be...melting. As I open the door


As we leave my neighborhood, but the effect messes with my sense of time and space just the same. I have a hard time telling how far objects are, and how fast we are traveling for the whole drive. Everything looks like tilt-shift photography for a while. We're listening to music, which is pretty amazing even though I know it's stuff I normally detest. I think about how there's probably layers of complexity and brilliance that I simply cannot see in this music. For the moment, though, I bob my head and talk about Vikings for a while. Not the sports team, actual Vikings. We're talking about how crazy it is that it used to be normal to simply take from someone what you didn't have. I think about how far we've come, and now we put men in space.


For a brief period(2-3 minutes, my vision is reminiscent of an old comic book. I feel like I'm *in* the movie Sin City. Not incredibly intrusive, but an interesting effect to be certain. Once we arrive at WALLY WALLY WALLY WALLY WALLY WORLD, I'm shocked at just how many people are there. The parking lot is half full, and I start pondering why this might be. Last minute shopping before the weekend? Drunks? Nothing else to do in this town? For that matter, why am *I* here? Oh yes, boredom and they've got toys. I try to go in through the exit because such an arbitrary rule is utterly meaningless at this point. My friend stops me. I walk through the store, because I'm on a mission. I want to see some TVs. We get to the electronics section and do a small lap around it. Nothing interesting. Wii-U controller is a fucking monstrosity of a thing. I'm not sure if they were messing with me, I find my friends. They're playing with toy trucks. Grown men, how depressing this place is and I suggest we leave before I over-think it.


We're going to Ricky's apartment to hang out for a while. Ricky is an old friend and I'm glad to be spending time with him as it's been a while. I'm utterly useless at looking up directions. Who decided I should be navigating? Once we arrive, I get disoriented. All the floors are identical, and every door looks the same. 


Ricky lives with Sanchez and Sanchez's girlfriend, Kenny and I are leaning on the balcony talking. I say that even an atomic bomb going off in the distance would only be a pretty sight to me. I then realize that if a bomb went off a few miles away, we would see it before the shockwave hit. We could joke ""Hey, remember when that bomb went off?"" within those few seconds before we're all obliterated. Kenny and I have discovered the most perfect possible instance of comedic timing. No one else thinks it's quite as funny, but that's why I love Kenny. A new face has arrived but I pay her no mind. Never met her before, and have no interest in making new friends. I harbor no resentment, but she is an unimportant detail. At one point one of my friends is trying to get me to sleep with her, and I'm a bit offended at this. How would you feel if a man slept with you *as a punchline*? I told him I would leave his children fatherless if he pressed the subject further. I was joking.


Then we notice that the balcony below us is full of people who are talking and having a good time. I make jokes at them that are apparently incredibly funny. Somehow I nail all the right accents and timing for every joke I tell. Am I picking up on the subtleties of humor better because I'm in better touch with my subconscious or am I just high as shit and everyone else is drunk? I assume the latter. There are a few times where the visual effects fade into the background and I just feel *right*. I feel normal. I feel happy. I sort of forget that I'm on acid and I start wondering if I'm coming down. But once I stop talking to people for a moment


At one point, on a beautiful night, with good company. The LSD isn't a necessary part of this equation, but it certainly helps.


At one point I find myself on the balcony alone. Someone said something that was awkward and as a joke I stormed out there to ""rethink my entire life"". But I actually went out there and stayed


On the way home, I think about the night and send texts to Kenny. I thank him for indulging my experience, and tell him he's a good friend. I finally fall asleep around noon. The visual effects stopped at around 10am, and the psychological effects were still happening as I fell asleep. Overall I loved the experience. It puts perspective on things, and I appreciate the people I was with more than I did before.

**Blue Shiva LSD:**
 Although this was the first LSD I've had, a strong feeling of happiness washed over me. By the second hour, I had yet to see any visuals, so I decided it was a good idea to try a second tab. After another hour It hit me like a sack of bricks. I started to see what seemed to be grafitti covering all of the surfaces of the room, each surface having its own pattern. At that point, I urged my friend to have a second tab as well. As it was the first time trying LSD, I began inspecting every surface of the room. The closer I looked at any surface, but I had a strong sense of one-ness with the world around me and I had trouble realizing the fact that other people couldn't understand my thoughts. Next, the effects of the LSD began to subside. We all decided to call it a night. Overall

1371678064.0,1gomxs,Gotsitall #4 Gram of H review!,opithrowabye,21,8,23,"Hey guys. Coming back at cha with another H review. This time its our other favorite gram slinger: Gotsitall.


Lets jump right into this.


Communication 10/10


Fucking amazing communication. Prompt replies to every single lame question I threw his way. Very prompt. Friendly and cool about everything. Offered tracking number and even checked it for me when I didn't feel comfortable accessing the page out of paranoia. Very awesome guy who knows how to treat customers.


Stealth and Shipping 8/10


He only offers express shipping which is fine but it is slightly overpriced. Just slightly though. This is alright for me but might be a problem for others. Shipping was two days to my location. Stealth was decent. Fairly inconspicous as far as outside apperance. Inside was alright. The only problem I would say is that he didn't even use a vac seal. At least I don't think so. It was sealed in some type of vac bag but wasn't vacced. I've tried 3 H vendors so far and only one has used the preferred and actually effective method of Moisture Barrier Bags. I realize they're slightly expensive but


Quality 9/10


It is a beautiful gram. Fairly large rocks and a pungent vinagar smell. Has a greyish white color to it and the rocks are pretty firm. They don't just crumble up. I'm not sure what that means as far as quality but


The high is great. Nice legs so far and amazing euphoria. I did a fair bit (60-80mgs spaced out over an hour or so. ROA was snooting) and am not nodding yet. I'm enjoying the high a lot though. And the nods might come in a bit because this shit feels like its creeping. In fact I feel them coming on at the edges of my high as I finish review up. (EDIT: a little while after writing this I had a great nod on. This shit was a creeper.)


All that being said subsrgood still has higher quality stuff for the same price. But, with subs I have complete trust. I've FE'd twice for him. Once on my first order because of a low transaction number and once to enter the VIP club/help him out because he said he needed it on the forums. Both these times everything still worked out perfectly and subs made sure I was taken care of. In addition to my anecdotal experience there are a lot of oldhead users on the forums that agree that if you're going to FE with anyone it should be subs. 


The thing is subs runs out REAAAALLLY fucking quickly. So if you're uncomfortable FEing or he is out and you can't wait. I honestly believe the only option is to go with GOTSITALL baby. Dude always has his stock ready to go. He is an amazing vendor and great guy and I know I will be back. 


Overall experience was a 9.5/10. gotsitall is my go to guy now.

Between him and subsrgood I don't see why you would go with anyone else. Why get stamps when you can get consistant and high qualith weight from vendors with perfect (100) feedback? It doesn't make sense. Unless you're in a very tight spot can only get stamps with the cash you have. Even then I don't see how its worth it. And this isn't from no experience I've dealt with the stamp dealers both IRL and on the road.


I hope this review was good and helped you guys out. Keep on fighting the good fight. We're gonna win this fucking war bros.

I first messaged him about his product and seeing if I could sample it. I purchased a cap of 2cb

The stealth was INCREDIBLE. I can not overstate that. I literally laughed when I opened it. I could not see how he did the packing. Literally perfect. That is all I will say. You will not have a problem in this area. 

I went to a friends house after work the next Thursday. We were going to a Borgore/Ookay show. Perfect opportunity to try this stuff. I weighed the pill

A little background. I have taken good molly many times before. I always get extremely energetic with it. When it first hit me was when Ookay got on stage, which intensified the effects even more. Wave after wave of euphoria and energy kept sweeping over me. I had a blast with everyone around me. I smoked all my ""neighbors out"", shared my vicks, gave hugs, and typical rave stuff. Then all of a sudden I became super chill. It was as if my body was like, ""Nah man, don't move, put my sunglasses on

My friend started to get overheated. We got some water and went outside to smoke. We stepped outside and smoked a few cigs while sitting on the curb. I been knowing this guy for 8 years or so, and stuff. Excellent vibes. We went back inside and continued to dance to Ookay, who played the best set I have ever heard.

I finally met this girl and her friend. She was obviously rolling dick. I blew the vicks in her face, and ended up dancing. Well, stuff escalated quickly. I will leave it at that, but she turned out to be an awesome person who I am still talking too. Thanks, Capsule Corp Match Making. 

I will keep this part brief, and I took a shower. Best. Shower. Ever. It was as if little water angels were masturbating on my body. Like I was getting a bukkake from every god humans ever worshiped. Pure bliss. 

After said shower I needed some cigarettes. It was that good. So I went to smoke a few and went back to the hotel. My friend and I turned on the TV, but the afterglow was so pleasant. The entire next day as wonderful.

My question is this.  Wouldn't it make sense to get a handful of innocuous things sent to your address in somebody else's name?  Brochures

**Jesusofrave:** Always good service, got 7 tabs for the price of 5. Discovery of the dosage being less than 100ug really put me off too. Seems like there's better stuff out there in regards to bang for your buck. Another good thing about JOR for me is that was he is UK. Only bought once from him, although got three items from him, two being free samples for reviews. Stealth wasn't great, but it's perfectly fine. Solid trips.

**Fartbomber:** Good service. Had a November sale going last time I bought from him, all allegedly 140ug (which I believe is about right, given the comparisons with JOR, and given it is lab tested). Because of the sale, I got FOUR Shiva (~60ug, pretty common blotter going around) for free. They tasted fucking disgusting, and FartBomber even mentioned that, so I PM'd him, and both times were great.

**Lucydrop:** Undoubtedly the cheapest acid vendor out there, but it's still very good, given the price and everything. I'm kind of hesitant to use them now, given they now require FE (they didn't when they were just getting started up, when I was using them), although it appears that all orders go over well, for the most part.

**Foxcave:** Best vendor I've dealt with. They sell mainly shrooms, however, the package I recieved from them had fantastic stealth, and it was very overweight. I highly recommend them.

So I received a package that I didn't order. It was a product I've ordered once before from this vendor. Any idea why this would happen? I ordered from him about a month ago and haven't had any correspondence since

I'm an honest customer and ideally

Is it possible that the seller was compromised, if I send him a message and say ""Hey, I received this but didnt order it, blah blah blah"", would that be enough evidence for an investigation? Basically, I'm admitting my SR username and my home address are together, and therefore have purchased illegal substances.

Is that completely far fetched or is it a possibility? I really want to pay for the product

So /r/SilkRoad, ya know?

Thanks for any help you guys provide!

Here's the situation:

Early MONDAY evening , EVERY time. I copied and pasted my PGP'ed address as I'd always done.

I wait another 12 hours, but don't see any note or anything about it being new. With all that has happened on SR, I'm a little sketched out, but I go ahead and send my address again using the new PGP key. 

I get an email from him a few hours later saying ""cool ok"". So I figure my order will be shipping soon

I wait another full day and it's STILL processing by early afternoon. WTF. So I email him again asking if there's a problem still

Two hours go by and no response. I email again and basically ask him to cancel my order (since I can't because the damn button is greyed out)

Wait ANOTHER day (12 hours) Still processing and no email from Vendor #1.

Finally the cancel key is working

Vendor #2

Now.. 2 hours after that

FUCK.

So what the fuck do I do. I'm out of bitcoins and I don't have the money to buy more at the moment. Vendor #1 AND Vendor #2 have BOTH shipped and I can only pay one of them.

I emailed Vendor #1 back explaining the situation and telling him I'm not sure what to do

I have a good reputation

I really need advice here. Besides pawning my laptop and TV for Bitcoins to pay Vendor #1 the only other idea I have is to wait nervously in my living room with my AR15 waiting for Vendor #1 to send his henchmen to come and rough me up for 6 bitcoins. I can't send his package back to him

""Pure MDMA powder is white and no other color. Any color in the mix is impurity and nothing else. 

So 125 mg of a brown powder will always be less then 125 mg of the white stuff. Color impurities come from an improper preparation

This comes from the fact that the freebase, a simple Acid/Base extraction is not sufficient even with recrystalization to obtain a totally white product. A Pinkish powder comes from overgassing an impure solution and not recrystalizing it. Dont know about black MDMA but I would be kind of scared to take it. This is trully dirty

Overgassing only applies to unpure solution. Distilling the freebase

Im a guy, 3rd time rolling, 1.5 months since last roll.

Me and my mate both dropped at 11pm. we'd double wrapped it as it had to survive a trip into town. for ages i didnt really feel anything, of course not! mduk, im sorry for doubting you. the slow onset was no doubt caused in part by my stupid double wrapping (which i wont be doing again). 

i started rolling at around 1am, the lows were chatty and friendly. dry mouth was only a slight occurrence, never a problem.

unfortunately the place closed at 3 and i was still feeling it big time. we stopped in a couple of shops on the way back to my mates house. the one had a giant cabinet full of cans of drinks. i have never seen anything so beautifully colorful in my life. I walk around the whole shop looking at how amazing all the colours on the food packaging looks.

we get back to my friends house at about 3:30 and sink into the chairs. he was pretty tired

At this point im still wide awake. not rolling as such, but i can see why people do it now. there was hardly any noise apart from the birds and the wind rustling the trees and grass. it was pretty surreal.

I got to the top of the hill and was greeted with the most amazing sight i have ever seen. the colours of the sunrise were unreal. unfortunately im not good enough at writing to describe just how awe inspiring seeing the sunrise was. after doing my own version of double rainbow guy i went and sat on the edge of a field and watched the sun come up. again

I finally came down to earth just after 6am. only trouble was i was at the top of a hill 30/40 mins from my house...arse. after an absolute mission down the hill and back to my place i had a quick shower and got to sleep at 7am

next day i was tired

Shipping: Farmer1 has the fastest shipping on the road that I have experienced. Normally packages take a minimum of three days to get to the east coast but Farmer1 processed the order the same day and got the order out on the same day

Product: Awesome. This is the first time I went after a vendor that had bud over the normal ~$250 range for an OZ and Im not disappointed one bit. The color is amazing and the bag appeal is nuts. The buds are all big

Overall Farmer1 was very professional and everything came as promised. I will be back for sure.

1362352115.0,19lp24,Nintendo and Chemical brothers review,lestrangeragain,20,5,2,"So I've been reading a alot about these Nintendo for a couple of months and I figured ""hey what the hell""

Firstly:
 - Correspondence was excellent. Apart from the Google-translateish English
 - Stealth was stellar. Really impressive! I will not write more about it
- Product. Yeah keep reading for that one... spoiler: Wonderful.

So TL:dr for every one on Chemical Brothers: Will absolutely recommend 5/5. Really good!

Now for the fun part:

So me and my girlfriend were stoked about this Nintendo thing. We had planned that we would take ½ each on a Friday and stay in. I had some friends over who were just hanging out so this was a new for me. I am not a regular E user

We took the ½ at 9:15 PM. We then started to play some board games all of us (yes

At around 9:45 I started to feel the jaw clenching up. Which was quick I thought! My SO didn't feel anything though. 

At 10:10 I was feeling it big time. It was rising and it was rising quick. The board game lost its purpose and we started to feel like maybe we should leave the others alone and spend some quality time with each other.

At 10:45 I felt comfertable enough to take the other ½ (now that we knew it wasn't poison - this however was not wise). So I took my other ½ and she said she was fine with it.

At 11:20 we had the most awesome of times. And then it happened. I sat at the kitchen tables, but really hot (warm). I stood up and felt like I was going to faint, drank some water, and asked about my pulse (really paranoid) and got calmed down and returned to pleasantville McAwesomeland. This entire episode lasted in total of 1 minute. Lesson: don't take two halves of a Nintendo within 2 hours. 

01:30 Time had flew by so fast. My jaw was really clenched. At one point I was actually just talking through my teeth. Sexy time was insane. We are a S/M-couple so that was intense! At this point I started to chew gum. Life saver!

02:45 I don't even know about time at this point. Everything is just swell. My SO took half of her half at this point. 

I don't really have a good trip report so I'm gonna skip ahead:

05:20 - we got to sleep. I had like restless leg thing going on and she suggested we take a walk. I declined and we both fell asleep at around 05:40.

The next day was good. I have taken E less than ten times in my life and I have never felt that day-after-blues. On the contrary I tend to wake up more energized. Maybe it's just the E still affecting but hey

All in all, I would recommend Chemical Brothers all the way!

1362255447.0,19jdlh,Vendor gilbertwallmvp is (almost certainly) a scammer. Pages and pages of FE and several complaints of nothing received and at least one forum complaint.,srthrowawayy,17,5,4,"I believe this guy is the next vendor to pull the FE scam. And I just saw this post made earlier today in the forums: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126722.0 by Jemeson. 

Note: I'm not Jemeson. I was considering buying from gilbertwallmvp until I looked into him a bit more.

Other feedback:
""This dick scammed me for over $500. Package but NO Xanax Powder. Totally and 100% empty. Oh but it sure had a tracking number on it. If he doesn't have Xanax Powder what does he have?

I wouldn't trust this guy with an adderal or a skittle. He's turned a scamming mother fucker. Read up kids. You mess with this dude and he'll have your ass raped in seconds.""

""FE as requested...Communication not strong...did not receive package...Fingers Crossed..""

""I'm very unhappy with this experience. Placed my order, still nothing. Finally had to request 100% refund. Gilbertwallmvp hasn't responded to me in days. Total waste of time, and in addition to this, now I have a refund in my buyer stats.
