1375708176.0,1jqk8t,You should never use the default colors in Matlab. This is why and what you can do about it.,jlansey,83,8,29,"**Summary**

Matlab's default 'Jet' colormap will obscure real patterns while showing you imaginary ones; [example](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mNVpcIxosyQ/T49UZSQMkqI/AAAAAAAAABk/Q7wiklw2LmE/s1600/different+colormaps+jet+bad+crop.tiff). The default line color styles are hard to distinguish and hard to even see!

**The problem**

Humans are not equally perceptive to all colors. Jet is just the most simple way possible to move through color space; [graph here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-maP_jZdLNSk/UWxnTqZR85I/AAAAAAAADfc/yT0D7GFKMoE/s1600/raw_vals_jet.png). Experts have designed color schemes in which two colors are spaced out equally in *perceptual* space making for an artifact free colormap; [graph here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-drhJFuk-ZqE/UWxnTtFHNrI/AAAAAAAADfY/g1csvWP0Mic/s1600/raw_vals_colorm.png).


**The solution:**

* [linspecer](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42673-beautiful-and-distinguishable-line-colors-+-colormap) this is a handpicked mixture of colorbrewer schemes packaged to be easy to use. Pass it 'N' and you will get N distinguishable colors. Pass it nothing and you have a colormap. (Full disclosure this is my file

* [cbrewer](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087) will give you every colobrewer option ever. This is your expert option

* [colorbrewer](http://www.colorbrewer.org) is the gold standard for colormaps

* [lbmap](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17555-light-bartlein-color-maps) has four colormaps for the colorblind and is really easy to use.

* [haxby](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25690-haxby-color-map) is most similar to jet

* [varycolor](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21050-varycolor) Does **not** provide well spaced colors. use linspecer or cbrewer instead.

**Use examples** (thx [tedwick](http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1jqk8t/you_should_never_use_the_default_colors_in_matlab/cbhbs8b))

* colormap(linspecer);

Replace the default colormap:

* set(0
* set(0,'YlOrRd',64));

Set the color order separately for each plot. Replace '8' with the number of lines you have.

* set(0
* set(0,'Set2',8))

Always increase line thickness to make nicer plots and better perceive color difference.

* set(0
* set(0

    % FOR RENAMING AUDIOBOOK FILES
    % 
    % PROBLEM:
    % Audiobook files are not sorted in the correct order on player
    %
    % SOLUTION:
    % Rename files so that sorting by filename puts them in the correct order
    %
    % When you rip the CD onto your computer
    % the book which contains folders for each disk.
    
    % For each of the disk folders:
    % 1) Open the folder and make sure the files are sorted by track number.
    % 2) Select All (Ctrl + A)
    % 3) Type in a short tag to identify the book (ex: 'LF' for Lord of the
    % Flies)
    
    % All the files in the folder should have been renamed to:
    
    % LF
    % LF (2)
    % LF (3)
    % etc.
    
    % 4) Rename the first one from ""LF"" to ""LF (01)""
    % numbers 1-9 so they look like this:
    
    % LF (01)
    % LF (02)
    % LF (03)
    % etc.
    
    % 5) Put the short book tag you chose here:

    book='LF';
    
    % 6) Put ""ren "" and then the path of the audiobook folder here (the folder
    % containing all the disk folders). The path must contain no spaces and
    % must end with a slash:

    path='ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\';
    
    % 7) Enter the number of files in each disk folder (ex: disk 1 had 10
    % files

    n=[10 9 9 9 9 10];
    
    % 8) Go to Folder Options in the Control Panel
    % UN-select the box that says ""hide extensions for known file types""
    
    % 9) Enter the file extension you see here (include the dot):

    file_type='.wma';
    
    % 10) Copy/Paste this script into matlab
    
    % 11) The command window should spit out something that resembles:
    
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (01).wma"" ""LF0101.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (02).wma"" ""LF0102.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (03).wma"" ""LF0103.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (04).wma"" ""LF0104.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (05).wma"" ""LF0105.wma""
    % &gt;&gt;
    
    % 12) Copy/Paste this text (minus the ""&gt;&gt;"") into Command Prompt
    % Enter
    
    % 13) All of the file names should now resemble LF####.wma with the first two
    % numbers being the disc number
    % number. When sorted alphabetically
    % order!

The problem is that there are plenty of ""Python for Dummies, but the Matlab textbooks mostly seem like they are intended for engineers and math geeks. There are some that are better than others, but still nothing that seems geared towards the true novice, with an emphasis on being non-intimidating.

I am well aware that online tutorials and such (and the Matlab help system) are a great way to learn (that's how I did it), but hopefully would be ready for the next school year.

My model would be something like ""Learn Python the Hard Way, and price ($3 for an electronic copy).

My first two questions to you are: Do you think the community (you) would be interested in something like this? Does it already exist and I'm just not finding it?

If the answers are yes and no, but the book would be about Matlab programming more generally. However, I don't want to get into heavy numerical analysis topics like many books do -- I was thinking more general programming topics like program flow and data structures, along with making basic plots, light statistics / data analysis / matrix manipulation, etc.

Basically I think the goal would be to lightly introduce a bunch of topics but mostly focus on the Matlab language and programming ethos

I have talked to some people who say that it's the programming aspect of MATLAB that discourages a lot of people.  The programming environment seems like it's fairly easy compared to other languages to me.  Granted, especially by smart people who have survived some extremely tough engineering courses.

One student did also express doubt about whether MATLAB is used much in the professional world.  But other students countered that they had seen it used in their experience.

So if C is 6 it will then ask for what each (i) component is and then conditions D(i) E(i) for each of them. So the number of input changes as C changes. This function gets its input from the matlab command window(GUI I guess?). So I would call it as The_Name and it would ask me for, A, B, C, D(i)

But when I try and call this function from another I can't get it to run with the proper amount of inputs. It either errors

I was wondering if it would be helpful if I were to create a Matlab Central/File Exchange git repository that mirrors the website.

The problems I'm running into are a few fold

1) I have my own little code repo of functions from years of working with matlab. Stuff like hline, and other functions from everywhere. If I hand my code off to someone or even upload it to the exchange I have to either include their files in my project. Making my project bigger or put instructions ""By the way you need these 10 files from these projects"".

This is a perfect example of how git submodules should work. You add a project/file as a submodule. Check it out and tada. All of those files. If anyone grabs your project they also just need to init submodules.

2) I never know if I'm running the latest version. I may have an awesome tool but it's not like I have time to go through every project I've downloaded and check for new files.

I have to first do some digging to make sure that I don't tick anyone off. But most all of the files submitted to the File Exchange should be a BSD license. It'd just be an issue with scraping their website. I was thinking of a scraper that went through projects. Parsed last update. If it was updated download

My next thought was to either use a .txt file or an excel file. This would get around the problem of the library being rewritten everytime I run the program. However this creates a new problem

I have an application in which I am trying to use image analysis to take over one component of data acquisition for some experiments I am running.   I'm pretty new to Matlab

What it boils down to is that I'm hoping to analyze black marks on pieces of white paper in a series of images I have taken. 
 
I've uploaded a couple of sample images [here](http://imgur.com/OkxW7

Primarily the attributes of the markings I am interested in include the 'coordinates' of each mark within the image, I'd be pretty ecstatic with my result.

The images I've got to work with are a 'first iteration', they are snapped by a tiny hand held camera, and I'm not really using all of the entire resolution of the camera available. 

I have been trying a similar approach to the 'grains of rice' example in the Matlab tutorials

It works well if I take small sections of the sample image I've linked to here, but fine tuning the size of the object seems to be pretty fruitless because the markings on the paper are so small.

My questions to you guys

* Am I missing some useful method or function for reducing the issue of the non-uniform illumination?

* How much easier does this process get if my pictures are higher resolution or better lit?  (Do I get more bang for my buck from getting a better camera?  Or should I simply focus on better lighting?)

* How difficult would it be to automate\script the process (ie. I throw in an image and receive a table with the information i'm interested in?)

I am using MATLAB in conjunction with a finite-element simulation program (COMSOL) that solves for some physics with a time-stepping method. How it works is basically for each time-step in COMSOL, so I need to store them somewhere. I have been saving them to a .mat file at the end of my function call and loading them from that .mat file at the start of my function call as a means to communicate this data between the different timesteps. This method was working fine for 2-D finite element simulations, however in 3-D simulations the variable sizes are much larger and the saving loading time becomes too large.

My variables.mat file that I am loading is ~25 MB, a 1x1 scatteredInterpolant, a 200x1 double, a 50000x1 double, and a 50000x200 double. It takes approximately 17 seconds to load this .mat file from the hard drive and 1 second to save it (on a computer with 64GB RAM and dual Intel Xeon X5690 processors). These loading times are far too large for my simulation to run in a reasonable amount of time, as COMSOL may need to compute hundreds or thousand+ of timesteps.

I am looking for a way to store these variable in the RAM somehow

I am a primary teacher (majoring in science) at university and am currently completing a presentation for my final assignment. Simply put


We are studying heat diffusion through the use of differential equations.

**What i'm trying to do**

Simulate the sequence of drops and the differential temperatures at specific locations on a metallic plate and how it varies over time. 

The plate is 1m x 1m and the experiment begins with the initial temperature of the plate being 0 degrees Celsius. 



I have minimal knowledge in matlab however I have gotten to this point and cant work out how i can loop matlab to read my values to plot it on the graph.

**My Code**

% Initialze the size and temperature of the metallic plate

mplate=zeros(100

 T= importdata ('U:\PHYS3203\input1.txt')
 
 %Seperate the Coloumns to define each coloumn individually

 v1= T(:

 v2= T(:

 v3= T(:

 v4= T(:

 v5= T(:

 v6= T(:

**Where i Need Help**

I am not sure how i can create a loop to read the values from my file (see below) so matlab will simulate the sequence of the drops of the liquid.

I have used the vectors v1-v6 to define:

v1 = temperature of the drop (dropTemp)

v2 and v3 = grid x-coordinate interval where the drop lands;

v4 and v5 = grid y-coordinate interval where the drop lands;

v6 = time instant (in seconds) when the drop touches the metallic plate.

Where each vector is represented in the corresponding collumn from the matrix i created.

*I am aware that i should be looping from 0-15 seconds with an approximate 0.5s (maybe less) pause/steps. 

I am thinking i should be verifying when the drop touches the plate the current temperature of the plate (i

I then want the surrounding grids on the plate (the surrounding 8 neighbor cells) to be updated.

*(im using a simplified version of the heal diffusion differential equation)*

I've been making a point lately to linearize my code as much as possible

It's data analysis based on a choice task, each corresponding to a parameter for that trial (many repeats, obviously).  I also have an Nx1 logical array that's 1 when choice 1 was made, and 0 when choice 2 was made.  We can call this variable ""choice"".

What I want to do is calculate for each parameter value, I want to find all trials with a value of 7, and see how many of these they chose 1 on.  I can trivially do this with a for loop (just loop through each parameter value and use mean(find())) but I want to find out if I can linearize this.

What I have so far:  I'm using allparams=unique(param) to get a list of all param values,allparams) to get a sorted numbering for each trial.  That gets me around the problem of having to find each parameter value, but I still need the for loop to isolate params.

Ideas?  I'm sure someone will come through with one line of code and make me feel stupid.  Can't wait.  I suspect it has something to do with dotting param and choice

This is the code I'm using:

    % a = mean

    % s = sigma
    % y = gaussian output

    clear all
    s = 2
    x = 0:100

        y = 1/(s*sqrt(2*pi))*exp(-(x-a).^2/(2*s^2))

    plot(x

My desired output is to have two overlayed gaussian curves. For extra points

 Ideally I would be scaling this code up to include several hundred gaussian peaks instead of the two shown here (however I need to understand two data sets before I write a code for hundreds).

Any help is much appreciated.

**EDIT:** For future viewers

    % a = mean
    % x = range (graph)
    % s = sigma
    % y = gaussian output
    % b  = peak intensity

1332027689.0,r1dvk,How do I change individual elements of a matrix from a set of co-ordinates without a loop?,Ayakalam,5,2,7,"
Hi all

I have a matrix

    A = [0 0 1; 0 1 1; 0 1 0].

Now I have two co-ordinates

    coordinateVector = [1 2; 3 4]; 

And finally

    newNumbersVector = [99 45];

The intent is that the first row of coordinateVector is a coordinate (1,4), etc. (It terms of row, colums).

So, 99. I also want to access element A(3,4), and make it equal to 45, etc. But how do I do this without a loop?? Right now I have:

    for ii = 1:size(coordinateVector
    
        A(coordinates(ii,2) = newNumbersVector(ii);
    
    end

Surely there is a better way to do this without resorting to loops! 

Thanks!

Whenever I run this code in the immediate window of matlab, the workspace shows I2 is a single value. Why does this do what I want in the immediate window, but not in a script?

**Edit:** I dun goofed

    I = imread('/img/pic1.jpg');

I just realized the immediate window is giving me the last value of I1 which would be the 4th line...so I edited out the 'I1 =' but this did not fix the problem I ultimately set out to solve.

    y = 0;
    a = 1;
    b1 = 1;
    g1 = 1;
    b2 = 1;
    g2 = 1;

    Matrix_part1 = [y y y y]';

    Matrix_part2 = [1/a+1/b1+1/g1 1/a 1/a+1/b1 1/a;
    1/a 1/a+1/b2+1/g2 1/a 1/a+1/b2;
    1/a+1/b1 1/a 1/a+1/b1+1/g1 1/a;
    1/a 1/a+1/b2 1/a 1/a+1/b2+1/g2];

    mu1 = [y;y];
    mu2 = [y;y];
    sigma11 = Matrix_part2(1:2
    sigma12 = Matrix_part2(3:4
    sigma21 = Matrix_part2(1:2
    sigma22 = Matrix_part2(3:4

    mu = mu1 + sigma12*inv(sigma22)*[x21-y;x22-y];

    Sigma = sigma11 - sigma12*inv(sigma22)*sigma21;

Code for multivariate distribution:

    A = -10;
    B = 10;
    C = -10;
    D = fun; % fun = @(x)-x

    bind1 = @(x11,mu,Sigma);
    pr_x12_x11 = quad2d(bind1,C,D)

    % This returns the bivariate normal distribution for x21 and x22 based on
    % mu and Sigma
    function [z]=problem_three_multivarnorm(x11,Sigma)

    x11_vec = reshape(x11
    x12_vec = reshape(x12
    z_vec = mvnpdf([x11_vec x12_vec]

I know my way around Matlab and Simulink rather well but I'll admit I'm completely clueless when it comes to the Image Processing power of Matlab. I focus mainly in controls. I know Matlab has some ungodly powerful image processing stuff I just have no clue how to use it.

I have an [Epson 2480 Limited Edition](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=48302407&amp;category=Products&amp;infoType=Overview) scanner with document feeder. It makes scanning photos easy... maybe too easy. I've cranked through around 1000 photos in the last few days. 

Problem 1 is they're in all sorts of orientations. My first thought was to use Matlab to recognize faces and then rotate them based on that. I'm not sure if facial recognition works that way if not I was going to resize (I scanned at 1200 dpi

I was playing around with [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) and for $0.01 an image I can get someone on the internet select the appropriate rotation. So I'm considering doing that. [I tested it with 2 photos so far and the results were pretty cool](http://i.imgur.com/kQA8UgW.png). Parsing the CSV and having matlab rotate the images shouldn't be too difficult. So I'll probably do that for the ones that Matlab can't figure out. 

Second problem is that I use [VueScan](http://www.hamrick.com/) instead of the Epson Scan utility because it works under Windows 7. (And if I ever want to scan in Linux or Mac OS X the license is cross platform). It doesn't autocrop from the photo because the background is dark. I have a few photos of 'nothing' because the sheet scanner will occasionally draw a blank. http://i.imgur.com/fs9r9lih.jpg 

However the holes in the treads is never in the exact same spot (because otherwise I'd just parse that out). And the photos are in all sorts of orientations, and the document feeder never puts the photo in the same spot twice so I can't just autocrop the same dimensions. A few of the photos also have dark backgrounds and I don't want it to accidentally crop it.

Third a final issue: Some of the photos are duplicates. Everyone that grewup with cameras knows you always got duplicates

I've uploaded several photos to this album: http://imgur.com/a/N6E8J.


Edit 1: Cross-platform would be Ideal. I only have R2011b and R2012b x32 on my work laptop. I have a server Linux server with 16 GB of RAM that could do all of this while I'm sleeping.

I want to create a function that will 'recognize' if a robot travels over the same point (or close to it) &gt;a times within the last b iterations.

To do this, and somehow list the positions in a continuously refreshing vector, preferably called PLACEMENT.
i.e.

    PLACEMENT = [ [x_t

It would store 200 or so of the most recent coordinates and overwrite them as the time-steps increased. 

The next step would be to run a 'check' of the robot's location. this would be creating a matrix of coordinates x

I would run this matrix of vectors for the current position and compare the 36 points to the last 200 positions of the robot
  
If the matrix contains a coordinate that occurs more than 'a' times in the PLACEMENT vector

I have read the image in and have a massive array that is larger than my command window. We've had less than 3 hours of tutorials on matlab and I don't even know where to start :/

You have been provided with a bitmap image (chromium.bmp) of an energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy map of a cross-section of a material that has been exposed to an oxidising environment. Light areas of the map represent high x-ray counts which have the characteristic energy of chromium. The file can be read into MATLAB to provide you with an array of dimensions 470 by 628 by 3.
470 and 628 are the pixel dimensions of the image, these three numbers are identical (since the image is grey), so you only need to use one of these for subsequent work. Note: the numbers in this array are of the type uint8 (uint8 refers to a one-byte number i.e. an integer from 0 - 255). If you want to use the surf function to visualise the data, you will have to convert these numbers into a different type which allows non-integer values.
Read the image file into Matlab. Split the array into quarters along the longer (628) axis. For the first quarter, axis information and a legend.
1 pixel = 0.0426 X 0.0426 μm
You may find the following MATLAB functions useful. Use the help resources outlined in section 6 of the class work sheet to learn more about these functions.
array = importdata(‘c:\full\file\path’), legend, hold on, hold off,

I am working on a project where I will be using MATLAB to develop an ""event detector"" that characterizes incoming mating calls of a species of tree nymph. Essentially, place it in the frequency domain, and then raise a flag that shows a mating call took place (the flag will trip when an incoming 500Hz pulse is immediately followed by an 800Hz whine that is sustained for a certain amount of time). Once this occurs, our system will respond with a ""virtual"" female response. 

I was hoping that the r/matlab community could point me to some useful literature on how to implement this in MATLAB. The main difficulty that seems to be present is taking in the signal in real-time

I am currently working on an experiment in PsychToolBox. I have several factors that need to be randomized. Their combination will determine what happens on an individual trial.

I have four factors like this:

    C = [0 1];
    D = [0 1];

What I want the for loops to do is count in a way that accounts for the matrix not being square.  I went through a 3x5 full rank matrix to get an idea of what positions the pivots were in so I would be able to get an idea of how the iterations should look and the pivots were in the (1,2),(2,3),(2,4), and (3,j+1) position will get eliminated up until last position (3

1354159883.0,13z2sq,quad() giving huge error.,steffestoffe,5,2,1,"I'm writing a program for an assignment where we are supposed to calculate the strength of a magnetic field from a coil. I guess the math around it isn't really important but it involves a function that has to be integrated but it contains a cross product between two three-dimensional vectors. As i understand it i can't  integrate the cross product and have to separate the function in three cases.

The function to be integrated is f(x)=(**t**x**r**)/r^3 from 0 to 2pi.
where **t**=(-sinx, **r**=(-cosx,-sinx,1) and r is the length of **r** = sqrt(2)

When i wrote it as three separate functions it worked fine.
Here is the function for the x-value:

    function B = funx(a)
    
    R=1;    
    
    r_l=sqrt(R^2+1);
    
    p = R.*cos(a);
    
    B = p/(r_l^3);

This gave me 1.9e-08 wich is close to the analytical answer (0). For the y and z i got 1.1e-16 (even closer to 0) and 2.2214 (almost exactly pi/sqrt(2))

But when i tried to mushing them altogether in a big cell array things got wierd and instead i got -9.4e-04 wich is way further from 0 when i used quad. For the y i got 1.7e-04 (should be 0) but i got 2.2214 for the z wich is correct!

    function B = fun(a)
    
    x=[0 0 1];
    R=1;

    r_l = sqrt(r{1}(a).^2+r{2}(a).^2+r{3}(a).^2);
    
    p = [(t{2}(a).*r{3}(a))-(t{3}(a).*r{2}(a));

Are there built in Matlab functions for this?

The reason that inv(A)*b or A\b do not work is because the inverse matrix over modular is the Adjugate * Determinate^(-1). But over modular the inverse of the determinate is not equal to 1/determinate


To work around this I wrote my own inverse modular function and then am doing the following to compute the correct solution to Ax=b(mod i):

&gt;determinate= det(A);
&gt;
&gt;inverse = invert(determinate
&gt;
&gt;InverseA = inv(A) * determinate; % To get the adjugate
&gt;
&gt;InverseA = mod(InverseA
&gt;
&gt;InverseA = InverseA * inverse;

        myObjCell = myClass(rand); % The input is stored in a property named value
    end
    
Let's say that I want to find the cell index of all the objects where value is larger than .9. So far I have found two options:

1. Use a for loop and filling each index into a vector

2. Do it like this:
    
    myObjVec = [myObjCell{:}]; % Convert to vector
    
    indexes = find(myObjVec.value &gt; .9);
    
Using a for loop is not an option

Using the second option seems rather inefficent but the code looks very nice.

My questions are:

- Is there a more efficient way

- Is there any reason to use a cell of objects instead of using a vector or matrix to begin with?

Any help is appreciated!

1317673329.0,kzpse,[Simulink/Matlab] How to access variable from M-file?,,3,0,6,"Greetings!

I created a model that does channel coding and it employs bpsk and channel repetition.

I have 3 variables that are inputs.  snr

Where snr is signal to noise ratio, well, the frame_size.  This isn't really important but figured I would paint a picture...

I want to perform an analysis where I try to find the bit error rate (ber) while varrying the signal to noise ratio and repetitions--for each frame size.

From the command line, and frame_size.  Let's say my model is called channel_coding, I then run sim('channel_coding').

Low and behold ber pops up because it is set to go to the workspace as a variable called ber in the model.

So, the model doesn't know and if I set the variable at the command line the m-file doesn't know but the model does.

I have tried making the variables snr

I also tried using simset() and that didn't work.

So

**EDIT:** So, found the answer and want to follow up.  In order to get/set vars for access between the function workspace (where my 'script' it) and the base workspace (what my model sees) I can use two methods:

* evalin('base','snr', `val`)

*OR* (seemingly better option)

* opt = simset('SrcWorkspace', 'current'); sim('channel_coding',[],opt)

a(x)*u''(x) + a'(x)*u'(x)=f(x)

I know that the left end is at x=0 and the right end is at x=1. So that means:

u(0)=u(1)=0 (does not bend at the ends)

I know a(x) represents both the elastic properties and the cross-sectional area of the bar and u(x) is the displacement at point x.

for the first part I am told that a(x)=1+x and f(x)= 5*sin(2*pi*x)^2 (this is the case where the force is applied symetrically and is strongest at x=.25 and x=.75)

I need to use dsolve to solve for the problem and plot the result on the interval [0

One problem I've come across is the incredible slowness when calculating the dynamic programming map to find the vertical path of minimal cost. Here's how I currently calculate it:

    function Mv = vertical_map(S)
        Mv = zeros(size(S));
        % first row is a special case
        Mv(1
        for r = 2:size(Mv
            Mv(r,:));

([http://pastebin.com/m3e179a08](http://pastebin.com/m3e179a08) if you want syntax highlighting)

Here S is an energy map that tells you the penalty incurred when using S(r, and then the values are propagated downward by finding the min in the neighbours from the previous row. Once you have Mv, finding the optimal path is simply a matter of finding the minimum value in the last row and backtracking.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could recommend some improvements to make it faster

Disclaimer: this is for homework


Edit: I vectorized get_mins and it is now much faster:

    function f = get_mins(r)

Code:

Run this and it will print 1 and 2 to the terminal almost instantly together.

Code:


    disp(1)
    for i = 1:500000

When you run this code you will find that 1 is displayed to the console and ~2 seconds later 2 is printed to the console.

Thus we can see that sin is much much faster than sind.

I have access to Matlab books and the like, I just don't want to spend too much time learning things that won't help me with what I'm going for.

1370467918.0,1fqyia,Interpolating (randomly scattered) 3-D data,w00ping_crane,2,0,13,"[HELP]

I am trying to fit or interpolate a set of some 3D data on a space of (x, and I would like to interpolate this data onto an arbitrarily defined and evenly spaced x-y-z grid, or to obtain a function of (x,y,z) that can be used to solve for what the data would be at any point in the space - either way is sufficient.

Say for example

The problem I am having with using interp3(X,V,XI,YI,ZI) is that I can not construct a 3-D array (V) from the randomly scattered points of the data that I have. As far as I know, the 3-D data to be interpolated must match the size of the meshgrid inputs. However, because my data is only at randomly scattered locations

So it seems like interp3 is not possible for what I am trying to do

I'm trying to write a matlab implementation of [Strassen's algorithm for matrix inversion] (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrassenFormulas.html). 

It's a recursive algorithm for inverting matrices of the form 2^n x 2^n. I got it to work but only for n&lt;=2. Since n=2 was my original test case I'm guessing I accidentally hard-coded in something that works for this case but needs to be generalized. Are any of you fine folks familiar with this algorithm or good enough with recursion to understand where I'm going astray?

I feel like this should be easy and I am missing something obvious. I am currently programming an experiment in Psychtoolbox and want to record the time stamps for the onset of each trial. I have a two-dimensional matrix that stores all the output which I later export as CSV. One column in that matrix should be 'timestamp'.

I was playing around with the 'now' command and even though I find that to be a strange way to represent time, is that if I look at 'now' like this:

    &gt;&gt; now
    
    ans =
    
       7.3533e+05

It doesn't show me the decimals. The CSV file will have a column that contains 735330 every single time. How do I store the decimals? I know they are there because:

    &gt;&gt; disp(sprintf('now: %f'
    now: 735331.689352

But I want the whole thing. It's a little weird because all the functions just seem to give me rounded output.

    % improving the zero crossing by using derivatives
    [m n] = size(xCoord);
    xx = xCoord(1):xCoord(n);

Method 1:

    Dim bx As New MWNumericArray(focusPoints + 1
    MWTemp2 = myMatlab2.DetermineOptimumScore(ax

Method 2:

xCoord and yCoord are originally created as basic arrays:

What I have are 3 square images, on top of the one and other so I have ONE image of the three images and then it also stitches a panoramic image with all three adjacent to one and other (essentially same height but 3x the width of any of the single images). Now I want to incorporate a feature that I've used photoshop for: adjustment of color levels.
What I need help with: What I used to do prior is manually layer the three images in photoshop, what exactly is happening to the image, as in the RGB values of the image particularly? I want to add this feature into my matlab code and manipulate the RGB values (or uint8 matricies) accordingly to the given three values I give photoshop. I am just curious at the algorithm (for a lack of better word) on how those three values adjust ""color levels"" of the image. Maybe an insight on what the histogram exactly means might help too.

Any help please? Thank you

**Example**: Here is the [original image](http://imgur.com/z6fzF) and here is the photoshop [manipulated image](http://imgur.com/DTKgW).

EDIT: http://pastebin.com/jqa6FC2Z

Problem: Drug solubility using the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation: 
The solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent at atmospheric pressure can be estimated from:  
x=(1/y2)exp(((Hm)/R)((1/Tm)-(1/T))
where  x = solubility of the solute
y2 = activity coefficient of the solute
Hm= heat of fusion of the solute
 R = universal gas constant = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) 
  Tm = melting point of solute
 T = temperature
For non-polar solutes and solvents
  
ln y2= (vl2(z1-z2)^2φ1^2)/RT
where      φ1=  (1-x)vl1/((1-x)vl1+xvl2)= volume fraction of the solvent 
and  z1 = solubility parameter of the solvent
z2 = solubility parameter of the solute
  VL1 = molar volume of the solvent
  VL2 = molar volume of the solute
The following data may be needed to solve the problem: 
Hm = 4300 cal/mol 
 Density of drug = 1.04 g/cm^3
Solubility parameter of drug = 7.6 (cal/cm^3)1/2
 Solubility parameter of benzene = 9.2 (cal/cm^3)1/2
 Molar volume of benzene = 89.4 cm^3/mol 
   
As initial guess values for x
Write a Matlab program(s), Tm = 428 K) in benzene over a temperature range of 290 K to 330 K.  Use MATLAB to plot your results for the solubility as a function of temperature in a MATLAB graph.  Turn in a printout of your plot as part of your hardcopy submission.

1351534061.0,12acgz,Question about translating shape functions into isosurfaces,EphemeralMemory,2,0,2,"Hey

I am trying to create a set of isosurfaces defined by shape functions (kind of like CAD curves). My code for such is [here](http://pastebin.com/80ZBXC4u).

What I can do is take a shape function for a sphere, however, it doesn't work. I am thinking it could possibly be a result of me not translating it right into MATLAB.

The line:

    % our_function = @(x

is the sample code for the sphere. I then have the example:

    % our_function = @(x

which is a bit more convoluted

I then have the more advanced line

    % our_function = @(x
    %                                                                             % Shape Function 1

which is the last equation plus some constraints for x

the output would be [10,4,3;1,10,10]
10 means there's a mine there
1, 2 or 4 mines around that square. 
I don't even know where to start.

Do i have to hard code every possibility or do I use if or while loops? Or does anybody have a different approach to this?


I was thinking of surrounding the matrix with zeroes and then programming it in a way where it adds up all the surrounding ones. This way it eliminates the need for hard coding edges and corners because it would exceed matrix dimensions.

I just discovered this subreddit and recently started using MATLAB due to my masters in university. Having som troubles and wondering if anyone could help? Here is my code:

    clc

    sum = 0;
    N = 100;
    smat = [];
    nmat = [];

    for k = 1:N
    
        while sum &lt; 1.6

        if sum &gt;= 1.6 &amp;&amp; sum &lt;= 1.62
            smat = sum;
            nmat = N;
        end
    
    end

    disp ([smat nmat])

What I want it to do is to display the sum and the variable 'N' for which it is true between the values 1.6 and 1.62. The problem is that it stores the value for sum and N when it is at max. If further clarification is needed,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,t3_105j6m

3. Finally is there a way to calculate the 'centres' of each of the 'rectangles' given that the points aren't ordered in a specific order? could one order these points in a specific order?
