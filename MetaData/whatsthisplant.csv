r/whatsthisplant is doing quite well. Almost all plants that get submitted get ID'ed or at least an attempt at an ID. There's been little drama and the community is steadily growing. I encourage all submitters to tell their friends and family

I'd like to revive the idea of adding a most-common link to the sidebar. We still receive a lot of ID requests for common plants that are easily IDed. Right now it may not be an issue, I'd like to get a page going with a picture of the plant, common name, botanical name, as well as a link to a plant profile site. 

I want to draw attention to upvoting of posts as well. I've noticed the plants that are interesting/pretty get upvoted the most

So we're midway through 2012 and the subscriptions are starting to accelerate. We're also starting to get many more posts per day than we were a few months back. As a result

I encourage everyone to browse the 'new' tab to ensure they're checking all ID requests.

The Unresolved ID list is currently still empty

Not being able to downvote people that are clearly wrong can lead to some problems.  For instance, then someone else posts the correct ID, we have 3/1 votes for an incorrect ID.  

I see lots of people throw out ID's on this subreddit, they may never check back and see the correct answer, they will just think, well 3 experts said this is correct.

Hi IDits. How ya goin'?

Just a little announcement on how the subreddit is doing

**Firstly**

Then on the 16th of September (last Sunday) we suddenly saw over 1,000 pagehits for the day (up from 1,000 on the Saturday.) I have no idea where the traffic came from. I can only assume we got a mention in a newspaper or on a radio station somewhere, since I can't find anything on google. Anyone know the story?

**Secondly**, but if the community continues to grow, these IDs take up space for other IDs that could go unanswered. If there's enough favour, I'll start a thread requesting which plants should go on the list, and we can make a top 10 or so which people will be encouraged to browse before submitting.

**Thirdly**, however they're starting to pop up in here quite commonly as ID requests. I honestly don't know which way we should go with this one.

**Lastly**, I think it's better if people just resubmit IDs that go unanswered.

So there we go. Keep up the good work,,False,self,t5_2si8i,False,,True

We've added a link to a list of unresolved Plant ID requests to the sidebar

General rules for the list:  

* If a post is over 7 days days old and doesn't have a resolved plant ID
* All unresolved list requests should be messaged to the moderators.
* **The moderators have the final say on whether or not a request is added to the list.** I see no reason why we'd reject any requests, no arguments. 
* If you believe you can ID one of the plants in the list

This is all a temporary system to see how it plays out for now. It may end up being too much work to keep running. In the future

**How you can help for now**  

* The thing we need most is any and all unresolved ID cases. If you have some spare time
* Please message me (Orichalcon) the links so I can add them to the list. Please **do not message all moderators** the links. This is to keep the clutter down in our inboxes. :)

The small green one with the ""fan"" looking top was received with just one stalk and one fan.  There has been growth outward.  Is it best to grow it on its side and cut off some of the top growth to re-root?

Any help/ID would be greatly appreciated!
