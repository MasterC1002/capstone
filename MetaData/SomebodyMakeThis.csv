Walking around large bodies of water and coastal cities leads to Magikarps or Seels. Walking in terrain deemed mountainous can lead to Geodudes and Machops. You can only find the super rare Articuno if you're in Alaska and extremely lucky.

I am just imagining something nostalgic and simple that you can easily do as you walk around or are just sitting on a bus or in a cafe. Free app since we probably wouldn't be allowed to make money from Pokemon. Anyone want to take off and run with this?

I had this idea for a video game while driving home from work. Think Spore meets Red Faction: Guerrilla meets Katamari with a little Driver and The Movies thrown in.

You would start as an otherworldly creature, you get to design everything about your creature: limbs, movement, attack style - think Spore. You can choose to be a Biological Nightmare (living monster) or Mechanical Menace (robot). Gameplay will differ depending on your choice.

In the first environment, you must destroy. Think Katamari, but instead of picking up objects you smash them - and like Katamari, the stages get bigger and bigger.

Let's say you're in a farmer's garden, like Left 4 Dead but with more customization options) and you start eating his crops to gain strength, which makes your size increase, which makes you dish out more damage. Or, if crops aren't to your liking (if you chose to be a Mechanical Menace instead of a Biological Nightmare) you go for his farming tools or barbed wire fence - if you're a robot, you need metal, and if you're a living being

Once you have grown to an appropriate size

Now you're much bigger, buddy.

Next up you see the city. You're about eye level with the skyscrapers

The next level sees you at about a mile high, where it belongs. Instead of eating to gain size in this map, you need to destroy enough so that the military uses nuclear deterrents, which in turn (and much to their dismay) make you grow even faster. Soon just the act of walking is enough to sink this hemisphere.

In the final level, you give the earth one last ""fuck you"" and kick, throwing it off its orbit and plunging into the sun. As you fly off into space, you wink and give the camera a thumbs up.

Other campaigns can run differently - Where you start in a Japanese fishing village, longing to show the reds who's boss.

Here are added elements to fill out the game:

Play Tone - There would be a tongue-in-cheek style of humor surrounding the game, and the news coverage will reflect these choices.

Loading screens - In between levels there would have to be loading screens, keeping track of the monster's growth and movement, as well as reflecting the play tone.

Design - A full on creature design tool would be a must. Everything from laser beam eyes to grabby tentacles and a slug-like bottom would be available, but would have to rely on throwing/jumping attacks for long range. As a tentacled menace, you could pull the city apart with your noodly appendages from a distance - lassoing buildings then ripping them out of their foundations.

Moves - A system similar to the old WCW wrestling games (I haven't played the recent ones) where you can customize your creature's move set to your liking. You could conceivably have a pink Cthulhu doing Capoeira across Manhattan. Who would then Moonwalk into the Empire State Building.

Cinema - This would be an option the player can toggle.

1276002254.0,ccpla,[SMT] A software compiler that optimizes its output using genetic algorithms,vagueware,22,6,9,"I have long been fascinated by genetic algorithms and their ability to find optimal solutions that humans would not instinctively attempt (e.g. [radio antennae](http://bit.ly/duIUA6) that look quite odd

I also think that modern computing architectures are reaching a point where systems engineers are ""guessing"" as to what is optimal (have you seen how many instructions are available on a modern chip? How can anybody know the optimal way to handle all of that junk?). As a result it may be that solutions we would not attempt are in fact more optimal. 

I also think there is the possibility to use other components within a machine (video card is one being used already, but no compiler designer would be able to reasonably factor in when designing a compiler.

What I propose is a compiler where we can provide several seeds of how an operation could be conducted. A very trivial example:

a = b * c

We need to explain this is:

* An assignment (that must always happen)
* We can do the assignment on the result of the processor's machine code for multiplication (b MULTI c)
* We can do the result of the processor's machine code for addition (LOOP c times: b + b)
* We can do the addition trick on c
* We can do this in many different ways using different registers
* We can do all the above but farm it off to a graphics card
* If an FPGA is around
* Heck
* Depending on context
* And so on...

You build up these building blocks of basic operations and more complex ones (including code to sending it off somewhere remotely).

Sometimes I'll want to say ""if this cluster of code takes more than x time to process, but not have it try it for everything

At compile time I tell it which architectures I want to use (so can disable FPGA, and say ""I want an optimal version of this program I have written in C/C++/Ruby/whatever producing for this architecture""

The compiler goes through multiple mutations based on the set of different ways of achieving the same goal at an atomic level we have described, cost, etc.

Each generation is benchmarked and so we do this not for things like ""find me the optimal way to add two numbers""

Eventually we get something we can execute on that architecture that is optimal according to the constraints we set: things are faster or more efficient than they would have been using a traditional multiple-pass compiler.

This has the further bonus that we don't care as much about the quality of the code going in with regards to optimization. Obviously good code written with performance goals in mind will likely score close to our optimal result in fewer generations (do we want to put known ""bad"" instruction sets in our seed algorithms to see where they mutate?)

Obviously buggy code will produce a buggy result, or more likely release engineers would produce multiple versions, (possibly that could be used to ""breed"" better versions), or if open source the end-user would be able to state what they care about.

There are of course constraints we'd have to worry about in future iterations: a mutation that is optimal in one environment might behave very differently if the kernel has to context switch more because in the real world it's in a ""busier"" environment

I'm discussing this in terms of general software compilation, systems that mutate to be more fault-tolerant of hardware failure for safety-critical systems, etc.

1313621210.0,jm3ur,"[SMT] An Atari MMO which combines ""Asteroids"" and ""Missile Command""",BrooklynLions,19,3,2,"First off you could and should keep the old school graphics. Maybe make slight improvements but basically a lot of lines. The thing that makes it is that it's and an MMO and that there is absolutely no AI.

There are two teams each with their own planet at opposite sides of the board (potentially you could expand to support multiple teams later on). 

Missile Command Part:

When you first start you are assigned to a missile turret. Your job is to defend the bases next to your turret. (Duh) Pilots from the opposing planet are trying to destroy your planet either by bombing or with kamikaze attacks (though a kamikaze attack would send them back to the beginning). If you survive without losing either your turret or your designated bases for a set amount of time you graduate in rank from turret operator to pilot. In this set amount of time you may be able to earn power-ups based on the number of pilots you take down or how long you play (if you defer the promotion).

Asteroid Part:

In the middle of the two planets is an asteroid belt. As a pilot you are not only trying to destroy asteroids so your other pilots can get through

There could also be a tower defense aspect. You could capture asteroids and either build improvements on them (gun turrets, or atomic bombs which make the asteroids into huge mines). These would continue to exist (flying from one edge of the board to the other indefinitely) until they crashed into a pilot or where shot down. Again, you'd accrue these upgrades based on kills or time on the board.

The ultimate power ups would be the ability to generate worm holes or warp. Worm holes would act like one way portals where anything can pass through them (put the start worm hole in the asteroid belt and the other right next to your opponents planet so they were bombarded with asteroids). Warping would require a great deal of energy which would only charge so quickly

SO there it is. I feel like the graphics and mechanics wouldn't be too hard. This is just basically a bigger version of games that existed in the 80's. But the MMO part would be what made it so addicting. The legend board would show the user with the all-time most kills

Essentially a user would create an account, line, style, etc. to find the piece they own.  Then they would add it to their wardrobe.

A bunch of useful tools could then be built around a user's wardrobe.  Off the top of my head I can think of things like outfit creation - the user uses a color wheel to pick a few colors they want to base an outfit off of
Additionally

Another tool could of course be shopping - buttons for _Find Similar Items_, shopping sites, etc. or the site itself could have a shopping area.  

Users could make and follow friends - they would get updates when friends add new items to their wardrobe and even recommend clothes to them.  Communities could start secondhand shops and trade services.

What do you think?  Is it do-able?  Does it already exist (with men's fashion too)?  I'd love to see it made if it doesn't.  Revenue would be possible too through shopping and such.  Maybe a premium user scheme?

Now the reason for her call was that I got her a very nice weather radio with an elaborate alert system for mother's day and apparently it wasn't doing much good.  I hopped on wunderground and looked up the weather radar and her house was right in the middle of three mesocyclone cells.  During the call

What good is a warning when it's already happening?

I've been thinking about something to solve this for a while now.  

We have:

- doppler radar with pretty high resolution
- algorithms in video codecs to detect motion vectors (I'm guessing this is what wunderground uses in their maps to show the direction/speed of storm cells)
- global positioning satellites (or at least google maps to select your location)

This could be made into a desktop and/or smart phone application that can tell you rather reliably when you're going to get clobbered by a storm cell

I'm hoping that some kind, essentially, is a converter of Terraria maps to any useful file format.  

Unlike current options (essentially screen captures)

http://wiki.terrariaonline.com/Map_size 

That link contains the various resolution of each map size as well as resolution in feet.

I've found that ~30000x15000 pixels (actually a bit larger) is the largest file that -most- graphics programs can open on Windows.  Photoshop can save and load larger files sizes

Anyway, I'd be able to select output resolution in pixels or inches/dpi and the program would let me know my current scale (and #pixels used/block.. 1^2, 2^2, 3^2 exc).  

By allowing selection of the PSB format (Photoshops image file format for HUGE files) for anything exceeding 30000x15000 (or so), it flakes out opening in anything by photoshop in my experiments a few years ago.)  Alternately, and fully acceptable would be to create the number of slices required to create the full map at 1:1 scale.

I'm thinking of how many Terraria-folk who have made amazing creations within their Large size Terraria world (mp or otherwise) would enjoy being able to share it online via google maps as a visual record or art

One of Terraria's best(?)/most advanced map viewers seems to be: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/terraria-map-viewer.4226/ .  It, not just a tiny segment).

It demonstrates that head tracking can be done and that full screen updates can be applied smoothly in response to the head position.  I'm not convinced of the utility of window parallax.  To me it seems like a feature that was added because they developed technology to do it rather than for any intrinsic need.    

If the same tech could be applied to colour adjustment I think I'd be far more inclined to use it.   Every monitor is different so there would need to be a calibration program for the user to move their head around and inform it which output colours map to which observed colours for a given angle.

Obviously, but the most common case for computer use is a single viewer.

The device was apparently something you hold in hand and a screen points towards sound. What I'm thinking is to have a large wrist watch type thing. Maybe it could even give a short vibration when sound is heard and then have an LED display indicate direction as well as we'll as intensity. That would be exactly what he would want. Anything that can SHOW him the direction of sound would be fine. I was vague because this guy is low income and anything to help in this way would be great. I don't want to hinder those creative juices. Thanks for the details request though. 

Recipient Info:
His name is Beda and he is my gramma's friend. He is a refugee from Africa though I'm not sure which country. He has a wife(who is also deaf) and several children. One way he used the device was for finding his child if he was hurt in the house.

I sell bottled water door to door, or wish them a happy birthday, etc.

That's it.  A very simple commission/check tracker, so I could keep in touch with past customers and perhaps get a car deal referral.  It dawned on me that this may be a very common need.

So I started developing it, alarm systems, etc.)  but i'm not sure what to do to do that. 

Maybe people here can help add settings to my settings tab that will make it possible to easily change features between industries. (ie: remove retention for car sales

[My Google CRM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AisGb4DHEZKxdE51azluZVRKdnRHRzV2dFNOWXVReUE)

Other things I MUST add for it to usable by me in door to door sales:

* Form to easily add customers
* A way to easily email all customers with a birthday in the active months (and who gave an email address)
* a way to add customers to my google contacts into a specific group
* a way to add google calendar events to remind me to follow up with a post card/email/phone call etc for various things.  ie) 10 days after the sale, I send an email with pointers and suggestions to keep their service top notch 4 months after sign up, I ask for another referral. during their bday month, I send an email and also a letter

__Rationale:__ The other day I discussed the problems of creating citations when using web pages. In academia the usual solution seems to be to just name the URL and the time it was visited. Wikipedia has its own suggestions

There are several problems with all existing solutions. The biggest ones are reliability and integrity. Especially among journalists ninja-edits are the norm

__Full description:__ My suggestion would be a web service that allows (registered?) users to request the archival of a public web page as a snapshot. The snapshot would be publicly available at a permanent URL (copyright laws apply, the original source's certificate (if SSL was used), the HTTP communication involved in assembling the snapshot (GET/response for each file), a checksum to verify the snapshot's integrity and a digital signature identifying the snapshot within archive itself.

These snapshots would be stored permanently (unless the removal is requested by the original publisher). If a snapshot is removed

__Why this could work:__ There currently is no sensible alternative for reliable citations of web content

__Requirements:__ The service would have to be incredibly trustworthy. The authenticity of the snapshot is hard to verify once the original source has disappeared, so storage may be a concern. The metadata itself would presumably be relatively lightweight, but again volume has to be taken into account. Depending on the intended uses beyond being a reliable reference for citations, geopolitics may be an important consideration in finding a suitable host (e.g. maintaining snapshots from politically problematic sources such as Wikileaks may be an issue).

Usually torrents contain .nfo files

Sometimes

**Use Case**

A more useful use case would involve downloading movies whose torrents contain preview files.  I would go out on a limb to say that most people don't want this, would set all image files to the lowest priority and use regular expressions to parse file and directory names for strings that appear to contain previews.

**Other Details**

All of these settings should be customizable with a simple text configuration files (perhaps in a webform format so that people don't have to bother going into a directory and fixing a text file)

Context sensitivity would also be really cool.  For example, axxo), deduce that it is downloading a movie and apply movie-specific priorities.  In this case, .jpgs are set to the lowest priority, files and directories are parsed for previews and set to ""do not download"", and movie files are set to the highest priority.

1279513998.0,cr31i,[SMT] Code/XHTML/Whatever Generator/Package Installer based on a JSON Editor,ithkuil,9,2,6,"##Motivation

The idea is that there are a huge amount of JavaScript/JQuery/CSS/XHTML/PHP/Rails/Whatever components/scripts out there to do most things, UI widgets or mini-applications, anything.  Those are mostly web development examples but this really isn't limited to web stuff.

It often seems to me as though the smartest way to build an application is to start by installing one or (usually a few) existing framework(s), and PHP code may mainly be initializing a class or two with some parameters.  I am thinking for much of this we could use a tree to configure the parameters or structure and then generate the source.

Usually when you go in that direction (away from just a bunch of plain source files), and generally interactive graphical editors tailored to the domain (including spreadsheet-type things, visual equation editors, graphical schema designers, workflow designers, etc.) are ultimately probably the level that you would hope to be at, BUT --

Besides the fact that a lot of people just hate those types of graphical editors

##Idea

Here is one specific example of the system I envision in use.  This is going to be generating a standard CRUD application (I'm sure someone will try to assert that you can't extend the model beyond this area or level of complexity but we can argue that later if you want

So this SMT system might look basically like the [JSON Editor here

When I start off the default tree might look like this:

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
  
So to install Formitable I just add the node

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
      - 'Formitable'
 
Adding that node triggers the automatic download and installation of that package.  One approach to that might just use something like a Google search and microformats [""rich snippets""](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html) to indicate package files (or vouchery) in markup.  Example, this could start with some kind of [jsonpath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) in the tree that leads to a custom function or [JsonT](http://goessner.net/articles/jsont/) or something.

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
      - 'Formitable'
  
    - 'Formitable'
      - 'connection' : null
      - 'table' : null
  
So you fill in the connection and table

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
      - 'Formitable'
	  - 'mysql'
	    
	- mysql 
	  - name: 'mydb'
	  - user: 'blah'
	  - password: 'blah2'
	  - tables  
		- mydata
			- fields
				- id 
					- type: 'int autoincrement'
				- afield
					- type: 'varchar(100)'	
			- schematext (generated)
				'create table mydata (id int autoincrement
		
	- files 
		- testform.php
			- source
			  - ref : 'showtest'
			- text : (generated)
				 include(""Formitable.class.php""); 
				 $newForm = new Formitable( mysql_connect(""localhost"",""mydb"",""mydata"" );
				 $newForm-&gt;printForm(); 
				  
    - 'Formitable'
	  - name : 'showtest'
      - connection : 'mydb'
      - table : 'mydata'
	  - normalizedField : null
	  - labelFields : null

	  
MySQL database schematext and testform.php text node are generated from the other nodes as you update the tree

There could also be a mechanism to display some nodes as XHTML for help text on each field or parent node

The point is you have a structured editor

The generation could use a special type of node with a JSONpath and then code to execute off of each matched node, matching things are run that do transforms on tree, or run code for doing things like uploading files or updating table schemas or whatever.  There should ways (custom functions, transforms) to combine/compose output of lower nodes, so 'text' nodes on a file generated by each child are serialized into the parent 'text' node (for example).

1272844655.0,bz6wd,[SMT] A new type of structure/layering design for audio file metadata.,tonstergfx,10,2,5,"I apologize if the thread heading isn't too clear on what my idea is.

Basically, track number, cd cover, and so on. The tagging possibilities are quite extensive, but there's something about it that really bothers me. The way I organize my music is by keeping the ""artist"" field constant throughout an album, each individual track may have a featuring artist and this is represented in the song name by adding ""ft. [featuring artist]"". The reason I do this is because if I were to add the ""ft. [featuring artist]"" to the end of the Artist field, my music software will separate it from the rest.

My proposal which aims to counter this would be to have the option to give multiple tags for certain fields. Imagine how much easier it would be if you could tag one song with all the involved artists. This way, because sometimes musicians will have the same song on different albums; this solves our issue of duplicates.

I really think that this is a good idea; I just have absolutely no idea how to go about doing something like this. To be honest

**EDIT/UPDATE:** after doing a bit of research I found that multiple tagging is actually supported on certain tags. As far as I am aware, you should find the songs tagged by that genre, and should you look under Genre2 you will find the same songs (given they were tagged properly). I’ve tested this with WMP only, so I’m not sure about the other players but it works with WMP.

I think this needs to be looked into because although Composer and Genre tags are already supported, soundtracks, collaborations would be much easier to organize.

One-line pitch: An FPS based on kids playing with action figures.

In basic play style, opening doors, etc. Visually, the design would be based around the concept that you are an action figure in a kid's game, and, as kids will do, he/they are making use of everything in their collection of toys.

So the environments may look like any kind of toy at all - a Star Wars-like playset, fantasy, etc.), or built from Lego bricks, or even made out of pieces of cardboard masking-taped together into rooms and corridors. Some levels may just take place on the floor and furniture of a kid's room.

Enemies would also be toys drawn from any style. Any moment you may find yourself facing bad-guy action figures, in proportion to a standard action figure) or stuffed animal. Or even those rubber monster finger-puppets (complete with a visible finger emerging from the bottom and disappearing into the floor). Most of them should probably move in that peculiar bouncing puppet-gait children playing with toys always use for ""walking"". 

Other than the visual style, when killed, to come back to life immediately by yelling ""Nuh-uh, you missed!"" Somewhere in there should probably be a ""Christmas"" level, in which a bunch of completely new enemies appear, sequentially, accompanied by obstacles of bows and wadded wrapping paper.

I got thinking that it should be possible to have a background task which monitors disk IO operations and file opening habits and dynamically moves files I access a lot (or which are causing lots of IO) to my SSD and set up symbolic links to them

It'd basically act exactly like a huge hybrid SSD

This would be particularly great for apps like steam, or even just the maps &amp; assets).  Dynamically moving the game assets which are causing most disk IO to the SSD will speed up loading massively while keeping everything else on your mass storage drive.

Obviously the main technical challenge would be avoiding file access conflicts while moving files to &amp; from the SSD.  
I don't think such a challenge would be insurmountable though.

I envisage the app at its most basic level simply asking you to select: 

1. Which areas of your mass storage drive you'd like to monitor.
2. A working directory on the SSD where it'll move files which are being read a lot.
3. How much space on the SSD it's allowed to use.

The rest it'd handle dynamically.

Think of most of the Sim Games out there now. You create a physical world by placing items. You view it at many differenet levels (many end at the individual human level).  Most have some sort of disaster or calamity you can engage. Some

What would the game be like, you changed the physics of the game universe?  I envision a spore-like game that was actually interesting and fun, but where you aren't necessarily controlling a character. Instead of controlling a character, you control the universe.  

You decide to increase gravity by changing the gravitational constant (or whatever it is called - it's been 20 years since I studied that stuff), seeing again, as the centuries pass by in seconds, how your world would change from that point on with it's new gravity.

You could watch things at a more micro level; how would that amoeba/creature/humanoid evolve (or would they even survive) if we raised the temperature

I'd love to take this even farther.  Depending on the computational ways of creating universes and their content

Stars can have certain features and are affected most by certain physical forces etc.  When we view a star for the first time (selecting it)

Planets require a star to orbit (or not, we have the choice of viewing individual planets.  Upon such a viewing of a planet, it is created in detail, and again, the game mechanics focus on physical changes in the planet based on your changes to the laws of physics.  The range of possibilities that can be created and how they might change should be based on mathmatics that vaguely and predictably produce believable results. If you increase the gravity applied to a planet - it's orbit would change in X manner, it's continents/oceans/climates would change in this manner, etc. At the same time this happens, but not as accurate as necessary for the individual selection of the sun.

If we'd had an original Galaxy level of view, or country level, or city level, or .... creature level.  A combination of Spore(but fun)/Simlife/SimAnt/SimZoo/SimTower/SimCity/SimPlanet/SimGalaxy/SimUniverse.  

I realize that this could entail a lot of data....but the amount would be dependent on you - there wouldn't be a switch - or a need - to make 'everything' visible... nor would there be a need to have 'unlocks'...people could spend as much time as they wanted looking at things in as much detail

This, relates to my desire to build a web site for creatives to create and share a universe's and to create a resource for fiction-writing in a fictional universe that, in theory, could tie together.  Creatives could share characters, environments, cultures - and create their own fiction building on each others' work and doing some gestaltian thing with the total being greater than the sum of its parts.

Anyway

*But this is where I think it might differ from existing services

The purpose would be more to answer questions when a person can't quite remember or articulate something: a word or phrase

Most questions asked of Cha-Cha boil down to ""google this for me."" This service would more rely on some member of the community making the connection from what would probably be an extremely vague description of something.

I think this question illustrates why this particular type of service could be useful

If I knew what the show was
&gt;""Family Guy"" arcade game gun stick-up

**Problem:** when viewing links it's common to see many reposts. For those of us who have been on here for some time

**Solution:** As people browse reddit a userscript can check the links against a web API which will check its own database to see if the exact URL has been submitted before. If it hasn't then it will check what type of link it is. 

If it's an image then it will compare the submitted image to a set of hashes that it has gathered over the years. As it checks the image/webpage it will add the URL and image hash to the database or increment the submitted count.

If the submitted link is an article it can check text within the article

If any of these checks find that a link has been submitted before then the link will be hidden from view and a new link will be pushed in to the list on reddit.

A system like this will ensure that only new links and no reposts are seen by the people who don't want to see them.",self,t5_2rngx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/ijc3k/smt_a_website_with_an_api_that_takes_reddit_links/

Just the file
http://i.imgur.com/BLoaT.jpg

In addition to having javascript I would allow a small extension.  The first line of the code could have a series of tags to indicate dependencies.  

So you'd end up with a post like.

    #needs yLuh8
    function $(id){return document.getElementById(id);}
    function html(id
    function css(id

The server would simply append all of the pieces together and serve them as a single static file (making sure it doesn't bring in the same thing twice)

so

  Jwaddle.com/BSIdw   would give you the details of the entry, ancestors,  A full list of the dependency tree etc. 

 Jwaddle.com/BSIdw.js  gets you the js with all of the dependencies prepended.
  
Posts would be permanent and immutable.  Once someone links to it they can rely on it being there forever.   Changing a piece of code that many things depend upon would require new posts of everything in the tree

At first glance that looks like a recipe for eating huge amounts of disk space and, for it to have acquired enough material to fill a 1TB drive it would have to be substantial enough that it would merit another drive.

The center column would contain a series of control-buttons such as ""close ProMouseus"", ""clear all application selections"", ""clear all parameter selections"", and ""clear all"".

2. The user selects one or more applications, Notepad, Run-in-minimized-window, and Run-as-administrator.

3. The user would then close the ProMouseus window and double-click on one or more files on the desktop or his file-manager of choice.

4. Those file(s) would then be opened in those application(s) using those parameter(s).

Advantages:

1. This is a tools-based approach to opperating on a computer

2. It grants a mouse-only interface something like the flexibility of a command-line interface.  

3. Lastly, or various dock-apps since it occupies no screen space when it is not being used regardless of the location of the mouse.  

Of course such an app would only be for a certain breed of power user.  I envision a number of options that would make it easier to use: Optionally, ProMouseus would apply a series of default options for that app.  Optionally, ProMouseus would allow only one app to be selected at a time.  Optionally, parameters that are only available for certain apps would only appear when that app is selected.

Use of ProMouseus would potentially be almost as fast as command-line with auto-complete: double-right-click,,False,self,t5_2rngx,False,,True

1270677451.0,bnugq,SMT: VHS data archiver,name_censored_,3,0,5,"The idea is to reclaim VHS tapes as a data storage medium; possibly as a backup. The scheme is fairly simple, to synchronise video and audio on playback/restore and to describe the format and variables. (Some other schema

* Grid column count
* Grid row count
* Colour palette
* Frame/Refresh rate (grids/second)
* Audio palette
* Audio tone/refresh rate
* Stereophonic packing (store 2 audio streams; one in each stereo channel)

Ideally the audio track/s would be used as data check-summing/error correction, the computer might even be able to correct the distortion (eg, the neighbours of highly chromatic nodes can be coerced/calibrated to their original colour if the ghosting direction and magnitude are known). Perhaps a calibration/stress test cycle can be run on the tape beforehand (the tested/stressed portion of the tape can subsequently be replaced with non-payload frames, eg, header/trailer, including a low-volatility/high-redundancy 'stress test' report). 

Inserting numbers

      64 rows, 32 distinct colours + audio checksums;
    = 64 * 64 * 24 * 32 bps
    = 3
    = 3

3,800 KB, or 43,200 MB, or ~40GB. Which is pretty damn good for something that a lot of us have a whole cupboards' worth of. And apart from the economics, it's a nice ""geek cred"" project ;) 

As far as implementation goes

 * GNU/tar (tape archiver)
 * SVG picture format (for generating frames - SVG is XML-based
 * mplayer/mencoder/ffmpeg (for gluing the frames into a video stream)
 * sox (for audio generation)
 * rsync (for rolling checksums and interruptable copy/paste)
 * lirc (for IR-blasting the VCR

The robot who's ""it"" must have a way to finding and following the other robots. I'm not sure of a good mechanism to do this.

Bases. The play area is marked with one or more areas designated as bases. A robot occupying a base may not be tagged. However

I recently had a website design idea. I would like to create a website that allows users to upload pictures of various stages of lives and then my website would automatically create a slideshow/gif of these pictures with relevant timestamps. I.e For me it would be something like:

- 1995: First Birthday (Photo of me in front of my birthday cake)

- 2000: First sister born (Photo of my first sister)

I'm not sure if this idea is too outlandish because I have no webcoding experience.

There are many other features that I would like but this is the basis of my idea.

Major Edit!: The website can have a separate page aimed at fitness enthusiasts who wish to show their progress pictures! It is a similar concept but will allow you to add notes, weights and goals. With IMGUR and reddit compatibility, it creates like a mini profile that can saved as a jpeg or png and uploaded to either of those websites. Of course, includes Twitter and Facebook compatibility of some sort.
