**Some perspective on making this worth it for Ubisoft**  
I just looked up and found that Halo3: ODST sole over 2.5 million copies in the first week. I just want to use that as some kind of standard for a goal of game sales. And This isn't accurate at all but there is a general rule the FCC follows (as well as many other places) that when one person complains about something
So.. if we had 25 thousand signatures I would guess this game would do as well as or better than Halo 3: ODST on JUST PC.
  
If we could do 5k more signatures.. That would be truly amazing
**10
  
Currently: 3k signatures. Is it possible to make it to 5? or 10?

I consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to gaming on my PC. If it doesn't run well
Here goes! 

I will only list emulators that I have used and/or ones that I have tried. I will also only list the absolute best emulators out there. 

This is my rig (for reference sake only): 64bit Windows 7 // i7@3.7ghz // nvidia GTX670 // 8gb ram // Logitech Dual Action (best for emulation IMO) 

= Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) =

- Emulator name: Jnes
- Download link: http://www.jabosoft.com/categories/3
- Opinion: Perfect emulation. Including the oldschool flickering sprite glitches and slowdown. It'll feel just like playing on a real NES. 
- Extra info: Upon loading go to Options&gt;Video. Under drawing method select (s-video) for realistic display. 

= Super Nintendo =

- Emulator name: Snes9x
- Download link: http://www.snes9x.com/downloads.php
- Opinion: Another solid and highly accurate emulator. Easy to setup and use. Includes Netplay if you want to play with your old gaming buddies. 
- Extra info: If you experience slowdown. Hit ALT+F5 and change around some of the display settings. This will resolve any problems you may experience. 

= Nintendo 64 =

- Emulator name: Project64
- Download link: http://www.pj64-emu.com/downloads/ 
- Opinion: Not bad. Most popular games work flawlessly. Extremely infrequent crashes
- Extra info: Unless you're somehow using an original N64 controller with converter... You probably need to create 2 controller profiles. One for most games. The second for FPS games like Goldeneye

= Gameboy and Gameboy Advance =

- Emulator name: Visual Boy Advance
- Download link: http://vba.ngemu.com/downloads.shtml
- Opinion: An old but amazing emulator. Still the best GBA one out there. No complaints. Also supports every Gameboy game. 

= Gamecube and Wii =

- Emulator name: Dolphin
- Download link: http://dolphin-emulator.com/download.html
- Opinion: Absolutely amazing emulator. One of my favourites. This will make your Wii and Gamecube games look even better since you can display them in true 1080p with high AA. 
- Extra info: !!!WARNING!!! this emulator has very high system requirements. Every game (that is 100% compatible) runs perfectly on my rig so please see my specs at the top to see if yours can run this beast of an emulator. Compatibility list is here: Wii: http://wiki.dolphin-emulator.com/index.php?title=Wii /// Gamecube: http://wiki.dolphin-emulator.com/index.php?title=Nintendo_GameCube /// Some games with a 4 star compatibility rating still work quite well. So read the errors carefully before dismissing them. This emulator will require some effort in terms of setting up. You will need to create several different controller profiles to suit each Wii game. With my controller I have no issues controlling most. Head to their forums for more in depth help as you'll no doubt fall in love with this emulator. 

= Sega Master System / Gamegear / Genesis / MegaCD / 32X =

- Emulator name: Fusion
- Download link: http://www.eidolons-inn.net/tiki-index.php?page=Kega
- Opinion: Insane emulator. Perfect support for all the consoles listed above. Filled to the brim with features and general good stuff. No problems. 
- Extra info: Make sure you dump your games in separate folders and use the hotkeys to load your desired console roms. This avoids confusion and keeps things nice and neat. 

= Sega Dreamcast =

- Emulator name: NullDC
- Download link: http://code.google.com/p/nulldc/downloads/list (bottom link) 
- Opinion: Not bad. I would prefer something a little better since the Dreamcast is one of my favourite consoles of all time. Most of my favourite games work quite well though with a few minor hickups. 
- Extra info: This emulator only supports .CDI files. So make sure you dump your games correctly. 

= Sony Playstation =

- Emulator name: ePSXe
- Download link: http://www.epsxe.com/download.php
- Opinion: Good! It's pretty bare bones but it does the job. Sadly games will not play some music (PS1 games often had music as CD tracks
- Extra info: Compatibility list: http://www.epforums.org/showthread.php?73805-New-ePSXe-v-1-7-0-compatibility-list-thread

= Sony Playstation 2 =

- Emulator name: pcsx2
- Download link: http://pcsx2.net/download.html
- Opinion: Love this emulator. While it isn't perfect
- Extra info: !!!WARNING!!! Also has very high system requirements. If your game looks glitchy or just plain wrong

= Arcade =

- Emulator name: MameUIFX32
- Download link: http://mame32fx.altervista.org/download.htm
- Opinion: Another one of my absolute favourite emulators out there. The Mame crew have been developing this beast for years and years. Slowly unlocking more and more arcade boards. (My brother works on this emulator!!). 
- Extra info: Hardcore emulator lovers will scold me for listing the Frontend version of Mame, Capcom, Namco and Konami games. A must have for anyone who loves video games. This emulator has high customizability.. so tinker away. This is one of the more complicated emulators out there, but thankfully there are plenty of guides and help if one gets stuck. 

= MY FAVOURITE CONSOLE WAS NOT LISTED !? =

- Tell me what you're after and I should be able to help you. I only listed my personal favourites and ones I would consider sought after. 



I hope this guide is what people were after!!

**Carpal Tunnel damage can become permanent

I know a lot of gamers completely ignore Carpal Tunnel. You see them all the time shaking their hands. What they are doing is temporarily alleviating the pressure on the affected nerve by jiggling their hands.This is a good sign you need to get help

After 25 years of gaming, starcraft player). This post will hopefully let you know what to do to avoid carpal tunnel's permanent damage.

**You can reduce chances you will encounter Carpal Tunnel by taking precautions. However

* Let's examine the natural resting position of the wrist and hand.
http://i.imgur.com/IJMEmCh.jpg
Think of a handshake posture.
* Now let's see how a mouse twists the arm.
http://i.imgur.com/YbVQR0C.jpg
A standard mouse twists the entire arm and causes strain. It's probably one of the least ergonomic designs we use daily.
* Let's see how a controller twists the arms.
http://i.imgur.com/bBQWba5.jpg
Much less stress

**Carpal tunnel prevention basics**

* Don't ignore pain
* Be sure to have good wrist posture and good peripherals. When not gaming you can use a less responsive but more ergonomic RSI mouse. ( A sideways mouse that reduces wrist stress)
* If you use a controller
* Ice your wrists and hands. Get a colpac made for wrists, treat your hands like an athlete treats his body. Prevent damage to your hands. Doctor's recommend icing for 15 minutes every 2 hours. This might not be possible or practical, but icing is great for your hands and wrists.
* Take breaks so you don't overstress your hands.

**What to do if you have Carpal Tunnel already**

* Resting / Not playing for a time. Some people can get away with resting the hand and letting the swelling go down. This however can take weeks to months. 
* Reduce use and switch to RSI (Repetitive stress disorder) peripherals. They can be expensive and are not good gaming devices. Sadly no company has made a true ergonomic mouse that is for gaming.
* Get surgery

**Holy hell did you say surgery?**

There is a procedure for carpal tunnel that is fast and works almost

* Same day surgery
* Cuts a tendon over the nerve and releases all stress on it

* Costs appx $2000
* 30 days heal time (no gaming)

Let's look at a picture of the surgery:

It's not an understatement to say that this game is a real hog. That said

* The number one way to get high FPS is to switch to Direct X 9 mode. It won't be as pretty

The following apply to DX11 mode:

* A big performance hit: Post FX. Set it to Medium and you'll see **big** gains and only lose a bit of lens flare.
* Shadows have a huge effect on performance. I've now got mine on Medium and everything else on Very High
* Switch to SSAO from HBAO. You can't really see the difference and performance is much improved.
* Set GPU Max Buffered Frames to 5.
* Set v-sync off (limit frame rate to 58fps on a 60hz monitor to avoid tearing).
* If you're on Nvidia
* Set Alpha to Coverage to Standard or Off - I don't notice much difference.
* Switch MSAA off and force FXAA in the control panel - looks as good as 2x without the performance hit.

FINALLY: no matter how you set things up, but for now it seems there are some optimisation issues - likely driven by console-itis.

Hope this helps someone

Things I love:

* No tech limit. I always thought it was stupid that in most 4X games you could reach the top of your technology tree. In Star Ruler, HP, production, and all those good stats increase. 
* Open code (not open source, and good ideas and fixes get incorporated into the game. I've had two of my smaller mods made permanent by the developers. There are also some great mods out there already, adding everything from extreme galaxy customization options to requiring food for ship crews. Also, no Diablo II mysteries about the game math and mechanics: it's all readable. 
* Real freedom for ship customization. It's not Space Empires, it's normal to have ships bigger than suns.
* The only limit for ships, this can definitely scratch your itch. I usually find myself with a few large ships, but beyond the resources to build there aren't any artificial ""logistics"" limits.
* It's on Steam.

Bad things:

* It's still a little buggy. The recent versions don't crash nearly as much, last I checked) a few versions behind the actual game, so keep that in mind if you're trying it before you buy.
* It's not finished. Diplomacy, there's only one set of ship models (though you can add more if you want). The tutorial is a little weak, too.
* For an unfinished indie game

Cross-platform developers always start with the lowest powered console as the limiting factor for game design. If a game can't be ported to xbox, it isn't going into our games. The next gen of consoles will change this.

* For example, the ""world,"" all runs on the super low powered xbox. The PC version offers enhanced DX11 graphics effects.

The architecture used in consoles has never been more like a PC before, if not the best selling game currently on Steam; still in the top 100, years after its initial release and proving most people either own a gamepad, or are willing to play these types of games with a keyboard. 

If these games are half as good as they look, being among the top selling games to ever grace the platform. I don’t know the exact nature of licensing with Disney, I can only imagine Kingdom Hearts III becoming only more and more difficult to port as time goes on, so please consider this while it's still a possibility.

If nothing else,000, or alternatively, around 3 times the amount of full price purchases needed to recoup porting costs. There already many petitions popping up, but they go unnoticed because people don't expect them to make a difference.

To give you a bit of perspective as to how long I've been away, two floppy disk drives and a button marked 'turbo' which actually slowed it down incase your games were running too fast on the mighty processor. I spent a lot of time making boot disks to try and get enough base memory free to run any of the games that I had bought.

Since then I've been in the world of Macs and the occasional bit of Playstation gaming. I use Macs because of my work and quite liked the fact that there weren't any games to distract me from actually getting a job out of the door. I think I was also kidding myself that I was somehow more mature. But now I'm 30

Second

Open command prompt

now type this command
 
    MKLINK.exe /J [exact Name of folder] [Location of the moved folder] 

For me

    MKLINK /J Save %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\Save 
Which Windows will translate to:

    MKLINK /J Save C:\Users\Acepincter\Dropbox\Save 

If the folder name was actually ""Data""

    MKLINK /J Data C:\Users\Acepincter\Dropbox\Data

The MKLINK command will create a unix-style soft link that looks and feels just like the folder is where the game expects it to be

To complete the process, and run the same MKLINK command as you did on the master PC.

This is terrific for syncing large-scale sandbox games that you invest huge time in

Let's start with the removal of the start button. Yes, I didn't like the new Metro UI start interface. But after about an hour, I couldn't imagine going back to the Start Button. It just seems so primitive once you get use to the Metro, and trust me, you will. 

The UI is much more smooth than Windows 7, after getting the hang of things, it's much more smooth than 7. It took me around an hour, hour and a half to learn all of the shortcuts and what-not.

The whole Windows 8 apps thing

The one gripe I had about Windows 8 was it took me longer than necessary to figure out how to add a tile to the start interface. And just incase you were told lies, folder, program, etc.) to the start interface as a tile.

As far as games go, on this laptop on 7, Fallout 3 would crash every 10-15 minutes on a bad day, rendering the game unplayable. On a good day I could go a an hour and a half or so. On 8, however, I've played for hours at a time without a crash. Makes me a happy camper. Haven't had a bit of trouble at all with ANYTHING I had on Windows 7. No incompatibilities, haven't had a SINGLE program/game crash on me

The reason I'm making this post is because of all of the rumors going around about how terrible windows 8 is

I haven't played a whole lot of games (just started playing again after a looong time), Crysis, TC Splintercell Chaos Theory, and Mark of the Ninja. 

I haven't played any of the Thief games yet

So I have two questions:

-what factors (technological

-what are some games with seriously smart and tough to beat AI opponents :)

(don't feel you have to answer both questions).

Here's my definition of ideal AI: this type of AI 

-remains unpredictable throughout the game

-uses group tactics to hunt the player (if applicable)

-learns from player behavior in the present stage or level.

Is it more cost effective to buy off the shelf or build?

[http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq](http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq)



*Is there a limit to how many trading cards can drop?
Most games will drop a number of cards equal to about half of the number of cards in that game's set of cards. For example, community market, barter with friends, and trade discussions. You can check how many drops you have remaining on your badges page.*



For instance, doesn't reset. The problem is that it takes 5 cards to craft a badge (which gains you a Steam Level) of any given game. It gets worse:



*What about free to play games like Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2?
Free to play games drop game cards based on your in-game purchasing history. If you've made purchases in-game prior to the Steam Trading Card Beta, approximately one card drop for every $9 USD spent.*

wat.jpeg

What this essentially means is that the only way to increase your Steam Level (the whole point of this update) is to either trade games (which cost money) or coupons (lol) with others (who will cling on to their cards as well as you only get a a few drops)

A while ago I posted a thread here about the crap that I have to deal with in order to get Razer to fix my keyboard (Deathstalker light switch).  

I actually got it resolved (miracle)!  A week later there was an Synapse update and it did solve the light switch problem

I decided to make a thread about it to do Razer some justice, and though they are WAY less friendly, they are able to fix the problem.

So I guess the summary is... Razer product aren't that bad.  If you do end up having a problem, and make some sort of demand to talk to the supervisor/tier 2 tech team.  After several phone calls, you will be placed on the ""priority list"", then the problem should be resolved.  If you just call them once and expect them to do something about it, I guarantee that almost nothing will happen.

First and foremost, but it doesn't test it.

Now if you can get into Windows the first thing you need to do is download [WinDbg](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279) (make sure to select to install WinDbg in the install of the service pack

These files are automatically saved to your C:/Windows/Minidump folder when you restart windows after your crash. 

Now

Now we are ready to open your .dmp file and figure out what the problem is (or get a general idea). In WinDbg, and you should be able to find your .dmp files in the C:/Windows/Minidump folder. If your .dmp files aren't there search Google for your specific version of windows to find out where they are at. When you open your minidump a lot of different things will pop up, you can hit the ""analyze -v"" link to get more information.

 [Here](http://imgur.com/9zxA0A9) is a example of a .dmp file being opened. In this Bugcheck you can see a lot of valuable information. On the top of this you can see a bugcheck number of 124 which is a machine check exception. Now if you search that on Google and read the rest of the bugcheck that's a hardware error. It also gives a culprit on the bottom where it says 

FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:  X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV

BUCKET_ID:  X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV

Now every .dmp file and every bugcheck will be different but this will give you the basic information to start a search on Google to see if anyone else had the same problem you are having. If you [search this information on Google](http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=FAILURE_BUCKET_ID%3A+%20X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV+%20BUCKET_ID%3A+%20X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV) you get a huge list of other people who have had this same error and many different methods to try.

Now

Ok, because those are your processors in your system (Reason for GPU is windows would consider your GPU a ""AMD Processor"" if you have a Radeon). Each section has information on how to run and test with each program. You will get your computer to fail with one of these tests if it's a hardware problem and this is something YOU HAVE TO DO. We cannot do this over Reddit for you. 

When one of these tests fail when you run them with the info the website says

Now

This should help some of you guys with getting crazy crashes! The best thing is once you go through this all once it'll get easier and easier to find out problems and you'll just get ""vibes"" on what's wrong based on the debugging information when you read it and you should always be able to keep your computer running fast and strong and stable!

too often overlooked though, memory express, and iirc canadacomputers, and have them build the pc for you, for a low fee (iirc it's about $50-100 on top of the parts and shipping).

a few things to have prepared:

* your budget.
* brand preferences (like intel vs amd
* OS preference(idk if any of these guys will do linux
* any peripherals you may need (mouse keyboard
* what size and resolution of monitor do you want. i suggest 22"" 1680x1050 or 24"" 1080p. you may wan to buy this separately. 

these guys will work with you to select parts, or you can pick it up in store when it's ready.

i especially recommend this approach to peopel coming from consoles

newegg and tigerdirect also sell some prebuilt packages that are solid buys.


EDIT: this post is advice for people who are otherwise holding back from pc gaming, over the premiums that dell and HP or even worse alienware charge. this is for those people that simply are unwilling to take that plunge, even if they are willing in terms of wanting the pc gaming experience and have the money to spend.

i've done a number of builds or assisted in builds for friends who were in that position. tired of what xbox or ps3 offers, where to look, or who to turn to. i woke up this mornign and thought, what about those people without friends like me, who will part out and build a leet gaming rig for them for a case of beer and a double big mac meal? these stores can be that friend, and it also starts their relationship with these stores, which i'd wager most of us know about from word of mouth

I want to get my boyfriend into gaming but he hasn't played a videogame since Super Mario Bros. 3. He said he loved it and would play it all the time but after that he just sort of never played games anymore.   
  He knows people love games but doesn't really know why and I've been trying my hardest to explain to him that the elements that make up his favorite movies and books can be found in games.  
  Now I have managed to convince him to try a game or two for me to at least show him why his sister and I play what we play. However
  Dialogue would probably be the surefire way to his heart with memorable characters bantering back and forth. He loves movies and books with scenes where people just talk because
   
  I'm not trying to push anything on him I just want him to know why I love what I love. It would be nice if we could get to the stage where we play things together but I'm not asking for a miracle. Just something that lets him know his girlfriend isn't as weird as she seems for loving video games.

1334335731.0,s859g,A Boy and His Commodore,a_virginian,38,7,9,"One of the first video games that I ever played was Choplifter. As a boy

I remember sitting on my knee chair in front of my dad's hand-me-down desk which had hand-written and printed scraps of BASIC code taped to nearly every vertical surface; shortcuts and commonly used prompts, on which my father placed a now faded sticker of the Commodore logo, had long since been cracked at one of the hinge points, but I carefully made sure it it didn't crack any further, mostly by removing the entire shell when it wasn't needed.

I spent hours upon hours learning BASIC through the mere necessity of trying to run the various game titles my father had collected. I played Zork, Asteroids, Centipede, Pac Man and many others. I thought Choplifter, however, was the coolest game. It gave me a sense of real accomplishment having rescued 'real' people and brought them to safety. I remember my first rage quit, though. I had been playing Choplifter for quite a while and I couldn't seem to live through any of the sorties. Over and over, I threw the joystick controller to the ground and broke part of the plastic housing. I didn't play for a couple days after that

I'm 30 now, I find my anger and self-loathing at how horrible I can play my favorite video games now and then hasn't changed a bit. The game titles change, the hardware changes, and the controller still breaks when I smash it on my desk. Instead of dot-matrix printouts of BASIC code, I have Post-It notes of HTML code, license keys for games that I've pre-purchased but are still in Beta testing, passwords to my EVE online and Star Wars accounts, regretfully

My dad didn't take me fishing, however, teach me how to ride a bike, fly kites, and virtually every aspect of remodeling a house, and he taught me what Shock was the night the (arguably) crushed my right middle finger under a chest freezer and then get pulled over by the police for speeding, but what stands out to me most is that he gave me a Commodore 64

After being jerked around and lied to by their customer service team I finally canceled my order. If you or anyone you know is thinking bout ordering form this company


To whom it may concern:

If you read no further than this sentence please know that your company and your customer support staff represented themselves unprofessionally

I ordered a Battalion 101 P151EM1 Gaming Laptop from your company on the 17th of December 2012. I hadn’t heard of IBUYPOWER before but it had come recommended to me by a close friend who was also in the process of pricing out a new gaming laptop. After some research and exploring I decided to order the aforementioned a Battalion 101 P151EM1 Gaming Laptop. 

I wish the rest of this email was filled with my thanks and appreciation of how well your company upheld it’s end of the deal, my laptops parts were being gathered.

Since that email I have been in contact with their customer support team multiple times trying to understand what was going on with my order. I first called on January the 2nd and was told, and then was promptly hung up on. I found that odd, but having received the information I wanted I began to play the waiting game again. Cut to next Wednesday, the 9th, I had yet to receive any form of communication from IBUYPOWER, whether by email or otherwise about the laptop that was supposed to ship 2 days ago, at the latest. I called customer service again and was greeted by a gentleman who clearly had about a thousand more important things to do than to deal with me, I had called so he might as well humor the customer.  I informed him of my situation (it was now 3 weeks since I had placed my order

Now imagine my surprise when I called again today (the 17th ) and was told that not only were some of the parts not currently in stock, the customer service rep did tell me not to worry, as it was going to get shipped out next week, for real this time. At this point I canceled my order.

I have never experienced the amazing level of dismissive, I feel like a sucker for ever having used your services. You turned the elation and joyful anticipation of ordering and receiving a new gaming rig and turned the process into a joyless, frustrating, and timewasting nightmare. 

For what it is worth

Thank you for your time.

So we got our behemoth all assembled and I spent a few hours this morning making the cables look nice - for aesthetics and airflow.  I also spent some time trying to figure out why none of the case fans were coming on.  The case we got has a fan control on the top of the case that takes a molex connector - the fan control then sends power to all of the fans.  It turns out that the molex coming from the power supply had a loose pin that pulled out just enough not to make contact.

So once everything was hooked up and juiced I hooked it up to a monitor, different video cards, etc. and came to the conclusion that it was most likely the motherboard.  We called ASUS and they informed us that our board had an old BIOS on it and needed to be updated to work with our processor.  Well without the CPU working we can't update the BIOS.  They're sending us a preflashed BIOS chip we can swap out.

Anyways here are the pictures of the completed rig:

[Guts](http://imgur.com/ryGuu1O) after cleaning up the cables.  That took about 25 zip ties to get that looking nice.  I know there are a few cables that aren't tied down

Me has teamspeak = talky talky fun times :)


Me and a small group of friends from all across the globe have been playing games together on the pc for years
Recently we came to the conclusion that having a few more people join our little teamspeak would be great idea for multiple reasons;

1 - It would be a lot easier getting a game of something going

2 - More people means a broader look on cultures etc. which could make a simple chat a whole lot more interesting.

3 - We like talking to people (duh)

Now before we get to the IP and ports

1 - Speak english

2 - Be open minded

3 - And for the love of everything i hold dear


Now you might be thinking ""this sounds great! but what if we don't play any of the same games? :S""
Well, Dota 2, TF2 (that's mostly me), ARMA 2 (yea, we might get around to dayZ), CSS/CSGO. Then we also have a bunch of games we play every once in a while, but you don't really need to play any of the above games with a passion
