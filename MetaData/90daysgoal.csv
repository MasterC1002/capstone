As usual the beginning of a round is a bit messy due to the amount of new users. We used to have one introduction post instead of many by every user but it feels good to have this kind of activity again (experience tells me that the beginning of a round is the time where most people are active and the drop out rate is still low). I will start an [official one](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krltx/intro_official_introduction_post/) and we will see if we can clear up our frontpage again.

You will be able to find the important posts in the list on the right side. We have some plans to keep you all motivated which, daily posts and this time a buddy system, but as it is with every round we will keep it slow and the first days are mostly about explaining what this is about, setting a goal, fitness, diet etc. So to those already asking for fitnessbuddies, workout routines, we will get there I'll have to ask you to be a bit patient by now.

So today we will be speaking about 90dg as well as setting goals. And for the rest of this post I will be shamelessly stealing from Katie's (hey there!) excellent round 4 introduction post.

**How does 90days work?**

90days is a tool for motivation and accountability. Every day, others are more detailed and structured. Write as much or as little as you want. Write daily, weekly, or just read other 90ers' updates for motivation.

Every week we'll have a check-in form. The link will be posted on Monday and it will be stickied to the sidebar. If you signed up for email reminders

~~If you signed up for weekly emails and monthly or end-of-round PMs, by default I'll send the monthly reminder as an email, not a PM. Sending PMs takes way more time, so I'd like to limit it to the 90ers who didn't want to give out an email address. If you still want the monthly or end-of-round reminders as PM, let me know and I'll make sure you stay on the PM list.~~ [My mistake, no PM reminders this round]

**How should I get started?**

I think the single most important thing for everyone to do today is to write down a list of your short-term and long-term goals. You can start with the easy things, and in the long term. But a longer, more detailed and emotional list will give you more motivation to stick with this. If you aren't sure what your goals are, or if your only goal is to lose/gain weight, take today to put together a more complete list. [Here are two good posts to help your set your goals.](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/setting-goals)

We'll work on our diet and exercise routines tomorrow, but since your goals may be emotionally charged, you won't necessarily want to share them with everyone on the internet. By the end of the day, I hope everyone will have a physical list of their goals somewhere. Keep it by your bed, on your fridge, locked in a journal, or right in your wallet. Write it down and look at it as often as you can.

Also

If you're not sure what to do, message the mods, or PM another 90er.

So let's get started! What are your plans and goals for today? for the round? long term?

If you're feeling dispirited, **you're not alone.  We all do.**  It's been 2 weeks now, the novelty has worn off, the excitement has gone, and some people have fallen off the wagon.  (With St Patricks Day on, I hope some of you did in spectacular fashion)


I'm here to say


Getting fit isn't about hitting a quota, or you cave in and eat cheeseburger smoothies and deepfried pizza, or just get lazy and miss your workouts, that does not stop you working out the next day.  Today.  Now.


Look at what you've done the last 2 weeks.  I've not heard of a single person who hasn't had an improvement, fitness or weight (up or down as you intend).  Messing up for a few days doesn't change that, you benefit from those improvements every day.  And most importantly, it doesn't make it harder to get back on and do it.


You CAN do it.  You can start again if you like.  Have another first 2 weeks.  The important thing to remember is when you do it, you pick yourself up, and you keep going.  If you think ""Oh I may as well give up now"", you couldn't be more wrong - work out today, right now, and you'll be back where you were.


Every single day, and you'll see results.

This is entirely community driven and self depended which means you decide how you diet and workout and we all as a community try to help you on your way. Community in this subreddit is a bit different than in other reddits, but also answer questions

Yesterday we talked about the goals, post a new thread (if you get no answer here) or pm a mod, just avoid not talking about it. It would also be nice if people would read through the [introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krltx/intro_official_introduction_post/) again. Get to know each other and read some profiles (it doesn't hurt to hit on the ""New"" tab) after this week (and after assigning groups and buddies) you will work closer together.

Understand the first daily goals as discussion topics to send you on your journey (and to help other people on theirs). This week we will talk about workouts as well as assigning groups and buddies. If you ever feel we are moving too fast

There are 2 things I would have talked about on a later date

**1) Fitocracy**

[Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/) is a workout tracker that treads working out like a game, teaches you something about different workouts, it has its own 90dg group and we will have our own challenges there. I highly recommend it. Fitocracy is still in its beta phase though, which means you need invitations to join. More in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krb68/1000_fitocracy_invites/) thread. If you join, also join [our group](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/17/).

**2) IRC**

We have our own [IRC channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/g14gc/community_irc_chat_for_90daysgoal/), send me a PM.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Now on with the original topic

We have people following all kinds of diets here

* Don't diet

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over

* Don't deprive yourself

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

Ok

What's your plan for your diet this round? Do you have any questions about which diet to follow? Any questions about the diet you're already following? Are you using any websites or apps to help you keep up with your plans?

Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

And finally

Good luck with your goals today!

This is a great place to get motivation, support, but it will eventually be easy to pick them out on the front page.

We will be compiling group statistics and charts each week so we can see how well we're doing as a group. Please, please remember that weight fluctuates a lot. Don't get too caught up in the number. As long as you're working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number. *Please still check in, even if your weight goes up one week.* An increase in weight is not a failure, keep coming back

**Edit:** Oh and check out the [first weekly challenge](http://redd.it/146k6h)!

***

In the rest of this post, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test
* [Digital scales](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ff&amp;authuser=0#q=body+weight+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gfm7UIKWNIO89QTVuIHoCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;bav=on.2

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons
* If your goals conflict with each other, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNSWG9DZWc4Vm16ZF9FU19YaTdzNFE6MQ#gid=0). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them

1354374649.0,143rpz,[Goal Setting] Goal Achievement Strategies,hellohowdyhi,29,3,5,"“Five years from now

Goal achievement is all about breaking down the goal into discrete actions with a specified result. Think of a goal as a brick wall. This goal is the result on many individual actions (laying a brick). The goal is also dependent on HOW those individual actions are executed. If you are trying to create a brick wall and you are lazy about the way those bricks are laid

How do you break those goals down into discrete actions? For me

* Play Hotel California on the Guitar -&gt; Practice for 30 minutes between 7:30 and 8:00 pm. 
* Run a 5k -&gt; Walk for 20 minutes. 
* Lose 10 pounds -&gt; Hit my calorie goal on MyFitnessPal

Alright

* Physical - maintain a healthy weight, be in the best shape of my life on my 40th birthday.
* Yearly Goal - For 2013
* 90 Day Goal - I will run a 10 mile race on Feb 6
* Weekly Goal - I need to run three times
* Today - I am going to run 3 miles at 10 min/mile. 

...and if I am still encountering mental resistance, I will go for a run. 

Some final thoughts on goal achievement. 

* Consistency feeds across your entire life. If you are not ready to commit to something, it affects my consistency across the board. Be diligent about all aspects of your life and be consistent. Hold the line.  

* 80% of success is showing up. If you are scheduled to go to the gym and you really don’t want to go and you think you’ll have a terrible workout

* Every Sunday

* Every day

* Finally

Good luck and see you tomorrow. ",self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/143rpz/goal_setting_goal_achievement_strategies/

In previous rounds, I'll be posting the week's worth of challenges every Monday. I'm in Europe, so for most of you, this should be up bright and early, for you to check out the week's exercises. So, without further ado:

**Monday:** Push up Challenge! Mondays will be a constant throughout the 90 days. How many push ups can you do, [standard push ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00_rniF8E), [one handed](http://www.beastskills.com/one-arm-pushup/)... You get the idea. Do three sets to failure. Each week we'll track our numbers and see how we improve. When you've done your push ups, come and post your numbers.

**Tuesday:** Planks. Similar to the push up challenge, but this week we'll keep it simple with the [standard plank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw). How long can you hold it? We'll keep track and see our improvements every week.

**Wednesday:** This week it's [triceps dips](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) and [walk up planks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8qOQ85fWNM). Do three sets of each

**Thursday:** [Lunges](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWLunge.html) and [squats](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWSquat.html)

**Friday:** [Mountain climbers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyeZM-_VnRc) and [Bicycle crunches](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/exercises/abs/44-bicycle-crunch.html). Three sets of each and check in as you go.

I hope things are going well with you. So far we've talked about our [goals](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krlrq/dailygoaltodo_day_1_september_26th_2011/), let's talk groups.

In Round 4, we'll have fewer teams with (hopefully) more members in each. We'll also have multiple team leaders for each group and a set posting schedule decided in advance.

Before you sign up for teams

###Women Losing Weight

&gt; Fun fact: 54% of 90ers are women this round. The women losing weight team provides a place for ladies to ask any woman-related questions, but we're looking for one or two more ladies to help share the effort. If you're interested in helping out with the daily threads, please get in touch with baiser to work out the details of who will post and when.

###Runners (edit: [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kviia/runners_lets_get_moving/))

&gt; Fun fact: 78% of 90ers are planning to run, which will include runners of all levels. There will be a weekly post on **Tuesdays** to talk about your progress for the past week, your plans for the current week, and any running-related questions that might come up. Hopefully there will be a large number of people starting the [Couch to 5K](http://www.c25k.com/) program around the same time this round and we will be able to talk about our progress as we move through the program. C25K graduates and long-time runners may be able to offer tips and feedback to help us on our way.

###Motivation (edit: [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kvccs/motivation_thursday_stats_updates_week_1/))

&gt; Fun fact: probably 100% of the 90ers want some motivation this round. The motivation team is a group for 90ers who are either looking for motivation or looking to motivate others. The group is designed to encourage people to open up and display their weaknesses and have the leaders and other members push each other to get rid of those weaknesses or work around them and make them into strengths.

&gt; JosephLeo will be leading this team. Daily posts will be as follows:

&gt; * **Monday:** Weekly Planner &amp; Challenge - Plan out your week and try out the weekly challenge
&gt; * **Tuesday:** Get Ready - Prepare yourself for the upcoming work week and learn how to avoid dietary traps
&gt; * **Wednesday:** Midweek Madness - Prepare for a quick work out challenge that's easy to do and just about anyone can do it.
&gt; * **Thursday:** Stats &amp; Updates - Post your weekly stats
&gt; * **Friday:** Almost There - Check in to see how you're doing and see how the rest of the community is doing too
&gt; * **Saturday:** Weekend Break - With the challenges for the week done it's now time to take a break until Monday. Check in for tips on how to enjoy your weekend without destroying your diet.

###Collegiate (edit: [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kva0z/collegiate_biweekly_post_1/))

&gt; Fun fact: about 30-60% of 90ers are college-aged

&gt; wolfbaden6 and absolutelovelie will be co-leading the collegiate team. They will post twice-weekly threads as follows:

&gt; * ~~Monday~~ **Sunday:** to get you through the drudgery of the start of the week
&gt; * **Thursday:** because that's when partying and bad decisions start

###Other groups

&gt; You are certainly more than welcome to form other teams. For example

&gt; If a team doesn't have a leader, even if an official team is never formed.

&gt; (Edit: A **paleo** team will be led by vampire_kitty! [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kvem0/paleo_ive_started_a_team_for_those_following_or/))

&gt; (Edit: **P90/P90X** and **Bikers** teams have been proposed. Calling all leaders!)

###Just give me the signup sheet already!

&gt; Ok

&gt; Just fill in your name under whichever team you'd like to join. Then participate in any team posts that come up. If you're willing to help co-lead any of the teams

&gt; If you've got any questions

I'll be posting the week's worth of challenges every Monday. 

**Monday:** Push up Challenge! Mondays will be a constant throughout the 90 days. How many push ups can you do, [standard push ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00_rniF8E), [one handed](http://www.beastskills.com/one-arm-pushup/)... You get the idea. Do three sets to failure. Each week we'll track our numbers and see how we improve. When you've done your push ups, come and post your numbers.

**Tuesday:** Planks. Similar to the push up challenge, but this week we'll keep it simple with the [standard plank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw). How long can you hold it? We'll keep track and see our improvements every week.

**Wednesday:** This week it's [triceps dips](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) and [walk up planks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8qOQ85fWNM). Do three sets of each

**Thursday:** [Lunges](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWLunge.html) and [squats](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWSquat.html)

**Friday:** [Mountain climbers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyeZM-_VnRc) and [Bicycle crunches](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/exercises/abs/44-bicycle-crunch.html). Three sets of each and check in as you go.

**Over Exercise Addiction.**

 Yes, over exercise addiction is typically when an individual exercises too much--repeatedly, ignoring their body's signs of injury and extreme fatigue.  Our bodies are NOT designed to repeatedly exercise beyond what is considered safe.  Often, the person suffering through this will feel tremendous guilt if they do not exercise &amp; will often bargain with their conscience just so they can exercise (ie. I can't eat today unless I....).  This is counter productive to living a healthy lifestyle.  It's just another way to ""purge.""  I strongly encourage everyone to exercise safely &amp; also to give your body time to rest &amp; (in case of injury) repair.

**Eating disorders.**  

Now that I touched up on over exercising, I want you to sit down and undertake some deep introspection.  We want you here!  But we also want you here in a safe and healthy capacity.  So please think about WHY you are wanting to lose weight.

**Extreme dieting.**

I wanted to keep this seperate from my ED discussion with reason.  While yes, we have individuals who will sign up &amp; create unrealistic expectations of eating 800-1000 calorie a day.  Please reconsider this.  Your body is not designed to live off of only 800 calories a day.  You are starving yourself.  Your body needs fuel and that is FOOD.  Though you might lose a few lbs, soon your body will go into starvation mode &amp; you will NOT lose weight (this last statement is up for debate--&amp;am speaking through personal experience).  

While do not consider myself an ""expert"" in any of the topics I've discussed

***

In the rest of this post, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test
* [Digital scales](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ff&amp;authuser=0#q=body+weight+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gfm7UIKWNIO89QTVuIHoCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;bav=on.2
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-body-fat-day-53/) - an easy first approximation

**Keep records

For all of your initial stats
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, [2](http://oi54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons
* If your goals conflict with each other, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBCbWtGMkVJaWp6OFlzT1FuZHphaXc6MA#gid=0). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step.

What are the Daily Challenges?  Every week day

These exercises will be doable just about anywhere - at home, etc.  I'll sometimes give you a choice of alternative exercises, just in case you're not quite ready for the standard exercise (ex. knee pushups vs standard pushups).  

The idea is to do the exercises throughout the day

***

Today is upper body day.  We'll be doing:

* [Push-ups](http://hundredpushups.com/what.html) (""proper"" or knee)
* [Bench dips](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) (keep your heels on the floor if you want an easier alternative)

Try to do at least three sets of each and report on your progress as you go.  And if you can only do 1 or 2 reps

As always

Have fun

###Buddies
For today's post

1. You can post here about what you're looking for in a buddy.

2. You can post a dedicated thread calling for buddies.

3. You can add your name to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodG15ZFozYXhabnptLXNzX3ZKU09BY2c&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0). In the first column, height, gender, weight loss goal, weight gain goal, life goal, diet or exercise program that you'll be following, favorite color, read through the others and see if there's anyone you're interested in buddying with. If so, and see if you hit it off. If so

Hopefully, it's up to you and your buddy to keep each other in check however you want - PMs, emails, text messages, whatever. There are no rigid rules with buddies, just take it whichever direction works best for you.

Just like learning a skill, and when it has reached capacity.  As you push it a little further each time, it gives more each time.

While I have grown to enjoy training to some degree, where there used to be only fat.  There is enough sweat on the front to have knocked me out before, but now it's just a sign I'm working hard enough.  I can't see my belly bounce with every step, as it used to.  In fact, it's only the size of a hamburger bun now, where it used to be half a football.  This is why I do it.  

For the comments at work that I'm looking great, the chest is getting tighter!).  The far more attention I seem to get from the opposite sex now.  Being able to enjoy things that involve exercise, like bike riding, without worrying about not being able to make it.  

I will continue to do it because this is a positive change to my life - I can do more, I can still do them whenever I do want to, I just don't do them simply because they're there.  And this is why you should do it too - your life will simply be better if you're not unfit anymore.

Check-in update: So far

For today's to-do, age, and height. If there's more than one match, see if the weights or body fat percentages will help you figure out your signup number. If you're not able to narrow down what your code is, send me a PM and I'll send it to you. Your code will be the same throughout the round and your data will up each time you fill in the check-in sheet. Please take a look at your information every now and then to make sure there are no typos. If you notice anything wrong, send me a PM and I'll fix it in the spreadsheets. There's more info about the tables [here](http://redd.it/l10t0).
So today's to-do: Find your code and check to make sure your info looks right so far. PM me if you need your code or if any info needs to be changed.

And now for the daily goals! How did your plans turn out yesterday? What are your goals for today? How do you feel about the changes you've made so far?

I also want to know what you want out of us.  Do you really like it when people comment or answer questions?  Do you just need a place to rant or write down thoughts?  Are there any topics you want touched upon?

Let's start today off with the [**Round 10 signup form**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFHemRiLVliQWgzR3ItOXJXQlI0YlE6MA#gid=0). If you have any questions about the form

If you haven't set your specific, keep reading. And if you have, keep reading anyway, it can't hurt... ;) After you've set your goals and filled out the [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFHemRiLVliQWgzR3ItOXJXQlI0YlE6MA#gid=0), tell us a little about yourself here or search through the [introduction thread](http://redd.it/1ajlw3) to find someone with similar goals. And don't miss the start of the [Sprint 1 Fitocracy challenges](http://redd.it/1axeeo)! For even more tips on goal setting, check out the [weekly planning posts](http://redd.it/1awtti) on the sidebar!

***

In the rest of this post, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test
* [Digital scales](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ff&amp;authuser=0#q=body+weight+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gfm7UIKWNIO89QTVuIHoCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;bav=on.2
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-body-fat-day-53/) - an easy first approximation

**Keep records

For all of your initial stats
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, [2](http://oi54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons
* If your goals conflict with each other, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFHemRiLVliQWgzR3ItOXJXQlI0YlE6MA#gid=0). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them

Hey there people, Fitocracy and irc. Are there any question left? And to stress yesterdays point, give us feedback!

This days topic

--------------------------------------

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before. Whatever level of activity you're at now

* Track your progress. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* Push yourself. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up

* Cardio is great

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K)

* Don't be afraid of the gym. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.

* Do something fun. Go for a hike

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises.""

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/)

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/)

* If you haven't already

And now for the daily goal posts!

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up

* Cardio is great

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K)

Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike

Today's topic is **Diets**:

We have people following all kinds of diets here

* *Don't diet!  Instead

* *Listen to your body*. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over

* *Don't deprive yourself -- strive for moderation*. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* *You can lose weight and still drink alcohol*. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* *You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets*. Again, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* *A specific diet might work for lots of people, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* *The end goal is a long-term, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  Eating can cause anxiety and stress -- especially when doing something new.  Stay away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.

We'll do a few sets of:

* Reverse crunches

Let's see how many people can plank longer than 2 minutes.  Or how about 3 minutes?

Do at least 3 sets and report in as you progress.

Example: Yesterday [and the days before] I'll have an ultra thin bagel with goat cheese [180cals], etc].

Welcome to Round 9! If this is your first round with 90dg

**Who we are** 

Women Losing Weight (WLW) is a group within /r/90daysgoal that is aimed specifically towards women. We are a dedicated &amp; passionate group of ladies that are after the same goal: To better our lives. Some of us are trying to lose weight. Some of us are trying to gain. But all of us are in need of support &amp; motivation and I hope you will find that here with us. WLW is run by myself &amp; my lovely co-captains: /u/nanochic and /u/dinosaurdinosrawr

**What we do**

WLW does not have a set goal within our time. Our initiative is to encourage &amp; help one another on our journey towards change. We want to target gender specific issues that you could be dealing with during this round. Ideally

**You**

Day 01 is always, I want today to be a casual, welcoming &amp; open day of discussion. Let us know who you are. Have you decided on a plan of action/ end goal? If so, what is it? If you haven't thought about it, please take the time to do so today. Let's kickstart this round off on the right foot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

**Over Exercise Addiction.**

Yes, over exercise addiction is typically when an individual exercises too much--repeatedly, ignoring their body's signs of injury and extreme fatigue. Our bodies are NOT designed to repeatedly exercise beyond what is considered safe. Often, the person suffering through this will feel tremendous guilt if they do not exercise &amp; will often bargain with their conscience just so they can exercise (ie. I can't eat today unless I....). This is counter productive to living a healthy lifestyle. It's just another way to ""purge."" I strongly encourage everyone to exercise safely &amp; also to give your body time to rest &amp; (in case of injury) repair.

**Eating disorders.**
Now that I touched up on over exercising, I want you to sit down and undertake some deep introspection. We want you here! But we also want you here in a safe and healthy capacity. So please think about WHY you are wanting to lose weight.

**Extreme dieting.**
I wanted to keep this seperate from my ED discussion with reason. While yes, we have individuals who will sign up &amp; create unrealistic calorie goals for themselves . Please consult with your physician before undertaking habits that could *possibly* be counterproductive to your health.

**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to increase one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot. Don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test
* [Digital scales](http://www.google.com/search?q=body+fat+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=671&amp;prmd=s&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=YL7gTJ6CA4G0lQep79W7Aw&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQrQQwAg) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/tag/body-fat-percentage/) - an easy first approximation

**Keep records

For all of your initial stats
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, [2](http://i54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people. [Avoid over exercising and under eating to reach your goals.](http://redd.it/o5pje))
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons
* If your goals conflict with each other, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

**Where do I start?**

I would suggest that you figure out where you stand now and write down your goals for where you want to be. Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them

More than 200 people have signed on to start making changes to their lives! Over the last couple of days, happier people and we’ll all be here when one of us needs help or encouragement.  

There will be another YDG post today for our daily goals, and anything else you might want to post about. In this post though, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, a lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (BFFM). I highly recommend that you get this book and start reading it as we go. Personally, I really enjoyed reading [The Body Fat Solution](http://www.thebodyfatsolution.com/) by Venuto (I found it at my library - if yours has it, get it now before another 90dger checks it out)

**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, I got mine for about 50 cents at a hobby/fabric shop), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. All of these are on the [goal spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodG9vb21TLXZFX3FEV200N2RFTV9tTXc&amp;hl=en). Even if you’re not specifically aiming to increase one of these stats, measure it now anyways. After 90 days, measure it again just to see if there’s a change.

One of the most important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques

* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are probably your best bet for a more accurate home test

* [Digital scales](http://www.google.com/search?q=body+fat+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=671&amp;prmd=s&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=YL7gTJ6CA4G0lQep79W7Aw&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQrQQwAg) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions

* [Visually](http://askthetrainer.com/fat-loss.html) - an easy first guess

If you don’t have an estimate for your body fat percentage

For all of your initial stats, go for it. Having them out there where everyone can see them has been very motivational for me.

Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, [2](http://i54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg), [3](http://www.dennisgetsfit.com/before-after.jpg). Ask someone to take your pictures for you or set your camera on the table and use the self-timer. If neither of those options work, take some mirror shots.

**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s The Body Fat Solution.

* He suggests that you make **specific**, body fat percentage, pants size, and jogging goals, with specific numbers for each. Not all of my goals were realistic (I had never jogged before, so my goal was kind of crazy), but I wrote them down and tracked my progress for them.

* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change

* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs per week, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.

* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, ‘All I have is today. All I have is this moment, the next hour. If I just do what I know I must do now

* Your goals should be **emotionally charged**. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them?  If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, which is awesome. Those goals, whatever they might be, are *hers*. She wants those things badly and they mean a lot to her, and because of them, she has stayed motivated and made great progress over the last three months. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.

* If your goals conflict with each other, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain.

* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, and make them **positive**. As an example, here’s one of mine: “On February 12, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By February 12, I will have lost 15 lbs”).

* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, don’t just read your affirmations; *write them out by hand every single day*.”

* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, and it *will* happen.

* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be


** Where do I start? **

If that’s the question on your mind, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can see them happening, and you know that they will happen. That’s a significant first step.

Everything should be written down *somewhere*, take a look at some of the other goals that people post or ask questions here to get some ideas. Coming tomorrow, healthy eating!

Today's topic is **Diets**:

We have people following all kinds of diets here

* *Don't diet!  Instead

* *Listen to your body*. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over

* *Don't deprive yourself -- strive for moderation*. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* *You can lose weight and still drink alcohol*. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* *You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets*. Again, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* *A specific diet might work for lots of people, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* *The end goal is a long-term, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, as a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  Eating can cause anxiety and stress -- especially when doing something new.  Stay away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind

And how did you do yesterday?  Did you meet your goals?  What do you have on your agenda for the day?  It's Day 2

Have fun!

Today is day 4 of our journey and we have a few different things to make a note of today. First off how is your day today? Doing anything interesting in the name of fitness? What do you plan to do today to further yourself towards your goals? Let us know!

First things first is to sign up if you havent already! [**Round 10 signup form**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFHemRiLVliQWgzR3ItOXJXQlI0YlE6MA#gid=0). If you have any questions about the form

We had toyed with some groups before in the past and it turns out to be a modding nightmare when we tried to split it up enough. We found that with a few larger groups though we are able to help more people by being more consistent. In these groups you will find posts for Runners

I may not be a woman but I am happy to see that so many are able to band together to work on bettering themselves. Anyone is allowed to participate in any group so hop right in and chat it up.
 

Now for some basic info we want to let you know about:

* Don't miss the start of the [Sprint 1 Fitocracy challenges](http://redd.it/1axeeo)! 

* Women Losing Weight posts will happen on Monday

Go forth and be fit!

Another thing I've noticed while staying here is leftovers. They will leave tiny amount of foods as leftovers. In my family we rarely have leftovers at all, but if that means you eat a little bit less every day than over a year that might be what you need to do to maintain your weight, or even lose some.

So, organized groups and buddies, now is the time to reflect on how you are doing  in all of this. This is the time for feedback here. Do you need help setting goals? Have diet / exercise questions? Are we moving too fast / too slow? Tell us what is going on, talk with us. One think I'd like to state as well, even though it seems at times that only a mod submits a thread, feel free to do so if you feel you have a question that is not answered in the comments or something completely different to act. We rather want more content than we do worry about a cluttered front page. Before I forget, please upvote the threads here

The most prominent change for 90daysgoal in this round is the introduction of sprints rather than having just 90 days. This is the schedule for this round:

--------------------------------------------------------

- Sprint 1: Days 1-30 (April 23 - May 22)

- Recovery: 5 days (May 23 - May 27)

- Sprint 2: Days 31-60 (May 28 – June 26)

- Recovery: 5 days (June 27 – July 1)

- Sprint 3: Days 61-90 (July 2 – July 31)

--------------------------------------------------------

Now why did we do that? Well as of most of the things here it is about keeping the people motivated. Experienced showed us that 90 days is a very long time and many people (me included) felt exhausted the closer we come to the end. In other words, if we need adjustments for the next period and in-between progress posts. Of course break periods can be beneficial as well, but as always here, you have to find your own flow, we just hope that this structure will help people staying on that road.

My last point, with the exception of one group, at least 10 members per group. I am sure we can still do better, so to beat the drum here again, [I encourage you to take part in our Fitocracy challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/sthv7/fitocracy_sprint_1_challenges/) as a means to keep you motivated. Please note that the deadline for the first set of challenges (we will be having one each sprint) is the **4th of May**. So join till then. And also as experience tells me, some people join the groups yet forget to join the challenge, so it does not hurt to check your group and **make sure that you clicked the ""JOIN CHALLENGE"" button**.

Before we end

A lot of Redditors have seen pictures that make me LOOK like I'm thin but... I'm not. Sure, holding my arms up, bending in just a certain way...

The reality is that my clothes are digging in (and I don't quite have a budget to upgrade them all - so, from the back I have fat rolls. When I don't suck in my stomach, I kind of look like I'm well into pregnancy (and have had kids at my prior work come up to me and ask me just that, as well as one or two of the elders :/ ). I'm sleeping shitty. Really shitty. I get worn out faster than I'd like doing regular activities (including sex which is embarrassing at times). On the whole... I'm just not super pleased with my physique and I'd like to change that.

In the past I ate a paleo diet and found that unless I did it 100% all the time (usually people do the 80% on, since I'm eating that, might as well get the bagel sandwich for lunch... mmm... today is going to be my 20% day and I'm having ICE CREAM!"" and then, soon enough, the whole week went by like that just eating crap all the time. I LOVED how I felt, slept, and looked at the end of just a 6 week period of eating 100% paleo and I wish to get back into it.

My biggest problem is that, sometimes a couple or more times per day, for months. This is not how I want it to be.

On top of that

I tried doing this on facebook a while ago - where I'd post photos of myself weekly when I had started a walk-3-miles-a-day regimen and... yeah. That lasted all of... once. So... I'm going to throw myself out there into this forum (especially since I don't use facebook anymore) and post totally embarrassing photos of myself. I wont suck in my belly. I wont raise my arms or take 25 pictures just to get 1 that catches a great angle... and I'm going to allow you


Where I am now:

*I eat reasonable but inconsistently

*I eat out almost daily or more

*My bedtime and wake times are ALL over the place

*I don't know exactly what I weigh right now (don't have a scale) but will go to a friend's house tonight or tomorrow and get a measurement and have him take pics to post as a starting point - but last time I was at a doctor's office a month or so ago I was 163 or 165 or something in that range.


Where I would like to be:

*100% paleo diet (exception for my Halloween party, and other RARE special occasions like someone's wedding which I don't anticipate to occur until next summer)

*Bringing my food to work daily

*Pick a bedtime and stick to it Sunday through Thursday nights - keep Friday and Saturday nights not TOO far from that bedtime (this would probably be easier if I set a time to turn off the computer and maybe go read a book for 20 minutes to rest my brain)

*Eventually
-In the meantime


Commitments at this time for which you all can hold me accountable. By the end of tomorrow (Monday):

*I will post my actual weight once I get on a scale

*I will take photos in all their unflattering glory and post them to this subreddit


Requests for connection:

*Anyone that is or is trying to get into eating a paleo diet as well

*Anyone that would like to create some co-accountability with me (I hold you accountable to what you say you will do

Before we get into our normal daily goal post

**How does 90days work?**

90days is a tool for motivation and accountability. Every day, others are more detailed and structured. Write as much or as little as you want. Write daily, weekly, or just read other 90ers' updates for motivation.

Every week we'll have a check-in form. The link will be posted on Monday and it will be stickied to the sidebar. If you signed up for email reminders

If you signed up for weekly emails *and* monthly or end-of-round PMs, by default I'll send the monthly reminder as an email, not a PM. Sending PMs takes way more time, so I'd like to limit it to the 90ers who didn't want to give out an email address. If you still want the monthly or end-of-round reminders as PM, let me know and I'll make sure you stay on the PM list.

**How should I get started?**

I think the single most important thing for everyone to do today is to *write down a list of your short-term and long-term goals*. You can start with the easy things, and in the long term. But a longer, more detailed and emotional list will give you more motivation to stick with this. If you aren't sure what your goals are, or if your only goal is to lose/gain weight, take today to put together a more complete list. There are two posts on the sidebar ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fu9ll/todo_welcome_and_goalsetting/) and [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e6cp3/90dg_day_1_where_are_we_now_and_where_do_we_want/)) to help you set your goals. 

We'll work on our diet and exercise routines tomorrow, but since your goals may be emotionally charged, you won't necessarily want to share them with everyone on the internet. By the end of the day, I hope everyone will have a physical list of their goals somewhere. Keep it by your bed, on your fridge, locked in a journal, or right in your wallet. Write it down and look at it as often as you can. 

Also

If you're not sure what to do, message the mods, or PM another 90er. 

So let's get started! What are your plans and goals for today? for the round? long term? 

Good luck today! :)",self,t5_2s0sd,True,,self1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/hyex7/dailygoal_todo_day_1_june_13th_2011/

For the next three months, better you. Along the way, we will fight off laziness, find the willpower to workout (and later realize turn that into a habit), gain entry into the Mines of Moria (speak friend. . .), and have random encounters with every opposing factor that comes with making yourself better.   

(Okay

What is unique about this, but we are all our own unique trainers and support. Here, and on the other subreddits, you will find like-minded individuals, either wanting to put on muscle or lose weight or something in between, that can help you in your journey. There is no paid service, no pro-level, no secret handshake, do not hesitate to share it.   

This is an interactive community—no one individual is in charge, and we have our own successes and failures. It is our “job” to keep things running smoothly and to find new and exciting materials from various sources.  We did a survey after Round II, and we appreciate your input as it is the only way we can make any changes from the day-to-day operation. We noticed trends and suggestions, and we will deliver on what we can. We will try to give you more resources, more guideposts, and ultimately help provide the motivation to get you through to the next level. If you want to see something, send us a message—we do listen and we will always try our best to help you do your best.   

If you are looking for an environment that will tell you what to do, materials, or equipment, and some of us have special requirements (physically, emotionally, or nutritionally) that must be met. So please, use us as a resource and a support rather than a guide.   

Now, in which case kudos!). As such, we are not a substitute for either—it is HIGHLY recommended that you do speak with a doctor before beginning any diet or exercise regimen. Additionally, while we can make suggestions as to what to focus on for exercising as well as provide resources on how to correct form, the best way to get personalized critique and live help is through the use of a fitness expert.   

With that out of the way, wishes, and plans to make this a reality. So, on this first day, let us take a page out of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle (BFFM). You knew this talk was coming, but it really is important to make a personalized listing of your own goals and desires, it is pointless to even set sail.  

Tom Venuto, for this, do not set goals that are easily achieved. Go big and go wild. While there certainly are genetic limitations, in the end you are the greatest limitation on your own self. So, if you want to have that movie star body as your end goal, do not put down that your end goal is to lose ten pounds!   

While I am borrowing rather extensively from BFFM for this exercise, I have a minor, written exercise that we all should do prior to beginning:   

1)  **Set Specific Goals.** Let us not be general and say things like “I want to lose weight” or “I want to gain muscle mass.” Let us use exact numbers and exact terms for what we want and how we want it.  

* Exactly how many pounds do you want to lose?  

* When do you want to complete your goal?  

* How much body fat do you want to lose?  

* How much do you want to weigh?  

* What measurements would you like to have?  

* What size clothes do you want to wear?  

Write all of this down and, but it is very important that we have these goals in mind and written down. Do note that wanting the completely illogical (losing 100 pounds in ninety days) may be unhealthy, so we should try to make our goals not only amazing, but healthy. You can certainly set a long-term goal of losing 100 pounds, but break this up into healthy, smaller goals of say 20-30 pounds in ninety days.   

2)  Once we have done this

* What is your ultimate long-term goal?  

* What is your 12 month goal?  

* What are your three month goals?  

* What are your weekly goals?  

* What are your daily goals?  

While you do not have to share any of these, at the end of the day your own inspiration must come from within, and your own personal muse must be the betterment of your own self.  

Do you want to look like someone famous for their physique? Do you want to impress anyone? Do feel like you need to prove something? Do you want more energy? Do you want more self-confidence? Do you want to look your best? Do you want to feel your best?  

Any of these reasons, tape a picture of them next to your goals. Keep visual reminders of your goal so that every time you feel down, or that you are progressing slowly, or that it is just pointless, you can give yourself the kick you need to get back into it.  

Your own health is not something you can merely try to upkeep. It takes hard work, but Yoda said it best: “Do or do not; there is no try.” While we welcome everyone, do understand that this is not a commitment to us, but to your current and future self. So, even if all you can do is a little to begin with, give it your all. Stay healthy, stay safe

Yes, that is fine—the difficult days get better, and any attempt to better yourself is better than none. However, do not let yourself fall into thinking that you will join in next time around, or that you are just not ready for this. There is no time like now, and in matters of your health, now is the best time to make positive changes.  

Even if you are joining us late—day twenty, there is no better time than to begin making positive changes for yourself. Join in and participate whenever—there is always the next leg if you want to fully participate in this goal. In our minds, there is no such thing as a full member or a better member: the only possibility is a better you and a long, fulfilled life.

They come in various sizes - from 1 ½ quarts to 6 or more.  Small ones are appropriate for dips, while the larger ones also work great on soups, main courses and desserts.  The largest ones are great when you have a large cut of meat, pot roast, pork, or brisket.

For most of us

Slow cookers normally have two settings - low and high.  Low is typically used for recipes that will be cooking all day (7 or 8 hours) while high is used for something that is done faster

When you’re cooking in a slow cooker, or pork shoulders.  Chicken thighs should be used instead of breasts.  Don’t even think of cooking premium cuts of meat or poultry - the results will be dry and unappealing.

If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe to a slow cooker

Be generous with aromatic ingredients (celery

Use whole herbs and spices instead of ground ones if possible.  They will release their flavours slowly throughout the cooking process.

Milk products should be added near the end of the cooking process.

In general

I’m relatively new to slow-cooking, when life starts returning to normal after summer.  I’ve been looking at the ‘Best of Bridge’ Slow Cooker cookbook, as well as /r/slowcooking. There are some excellent links to slow cooker recipe sites from there.

How are you going to hold yourself accountable for what you need to do and what you have done?  Do you get other people involved?  Do you use that gym app where you have to put money into a pot and if you don't work out, especially for a long time?  Is there a consequence to not working out or not sticking to your diet?

My week plan always starts with what I call my Optimal Week - what should my normal week look like if I want to accomplish the things I need to achieve my goals. 

Here’s an example of my Optimal Week. 

* Sunday - Weekly Plan
* Monday - Publish management blog
* Tuesday - Lift and/or Yoga
* Wednesday - Golf or Run
* Thursday - Publish Technical Blog
* Friday - Tempo Run
* Saturday - Golf or Running

What does your optimal week look like?

More times than not

* Sunday - Weekly Plan
* Monday - Publish management blog
* Tuesday - Lift and/or Yoga
* Wednesday - Run in morning
* Thursday - Publish Technical Blog
* Friday - Run in morning
* Saturday - Daughter’s birthday party

Really quickly I can see three different things this week that I will need to address to ensure I stay within my calorie goals and make sure I get my workouts in. On Weds, I will make sure just to eat prior to everyone getting there and limit myself to one cupcake. Saturday MIGHT put me over my calorie limit, but there is nothing stopping me from going out that afternoon or evening for a walk to burn the excess.

Today is day 4 of our journey and we have a few different things to make a note of today. First off how is your day today? Doing anything interesting in the name of fitness? What do you plan to do today to further yourself towards your goals? Let us know!

We had toyed with some groups before in the past and it turns out to be a modding nightmare when we tried to split it up enough. We found that with a few larger groups though we are able to help more people by being more consistent. In these groups you will find posts for Runners

I may not be a woman but I am happy to see that so many are able to band together to work on bettering themselves. It is awesome to see. If you fit into one of these categories you are more than welcome to join into the discussions.

Also if you have not done so please check out the sidebar specifically to sign up for this new round of 90days or to look into the Questionnaire! These are important components of our round this time. 

Now for some basic info we want to let you know about:

* There will be three sets of month-long Fitocracy challenges this time. No weekly or 90-day challenges. The challenges will be private

* Paleo/vegetarian/vegan/keto posts are all going to be wrapped up into the food posts by princessbitchtits. She'll be posting every Saturday.

* Couch to 5K and Bridge to 10K - posted every Sunday

[Yesterday](http://redd.it/oatkk) we discussed diet

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now
Our [Daily Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/obtba/daily_challenge_wednesday_january_11_2012/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up

* Cardio is great

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K)

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/)

* If you haven't done so already

For those of you that have just started with 90DaysGoal and/or have never participated in the Daily Challenge, in an empty office at work, an empty classroom, etc.  I usually do mine at work, at the end of a hallway near an emergency exit.

During the course of the day

If any of the exercises are too difficult

---

Today's challenge consists of my two favorite abdominal exercises:

* [Planks](http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm) (if you cannot do an extended plank
* [Crunches](http://www.fitstep.com/Library/Exercises/Crunches.htm)

Try to do at least 3 sets of each.

Remember - we're all at different fitness levels


As always

**Original r/90days**

As some of you might remember, regardless of weight or fitness level. It was a pretty amazing promise, and nearly 2000 Redditors subscribed to the subreddit, eager to turn their lives around. When things fell through with the original r/90days, some people lost motivation or didn’t know how to get started on their own, but [not everyone stopped in their tracks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/e21qr/90_days_is_up_results/). In the original Day 1 post at r/90days, the man wrote “Don’t underestimate the powerful benefits of having the support of a community who are sharing the same journey.” That is exactly what we have tried to create at r/90daysgoal, 90 days later

**The past 90 days at r/90daysgoal**

We’ve been using this subreddit as a place to tell each other about the breakthroughs and problems that we’ve been having with our eating habits and exercise routines. We’ve posted tips, and lots of encouragement, and overall, I think the results have been pretty great. Although we lost a lot of our regular posters over time, we finished our three months with a nice sized crowd remaining. On our final day, we had 17 people (or about 8% of the people subscribed to the reddit) report their final stats, which can be seen [here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AjcJ6GpNQiUKdDdXUE50WXdEUmJlNlpacGNsWjlRaFE&amp;hl=en). There are some more complete stats on [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p_Q0a1kTBGzKElk_AH9n4JaDmPW9jlCB2HOsexuiVBA/edit?hl=en). Many thanks to knioette for putting these together. :)

**90days Round 2**

Now that our first 90 days together are over, happier people. If you aren’t sure how to get started, or if you struggle to maintain your motivation, or if you work out and eat right but aren’t seeing any progress, hopefully joining this group will point you in the right direction, keep you on track, and help you to push through plateaus.

As we did in Round 1, setbacks, or whatever else they feel like talking about. In the beginning, these will most likely be filled with questions and suggestions, and hopefully they’ll be very informative for us all. As we get closer to the end of the 90 days, the YDG posts will start turn in to “More of the same today, still keeping on track” as most of us will be settled into our routines by then, it feels kind of weird to post something that essentially says you have nothing to say

**Something New in Round 2**

The original r/90days included daily posts to help us skip over the diet and workout clutter to find the information that really matters. There were several posts and comments after the r/90days crash that indicated that people *want* to make changes, they weren’t sure how to get started. To be clear, this isn’t the same as r/90days was. We don’t have a single leader guiding us to our new lives this time. For Round 1, we each followed different routines and had very different diets.

However, these will mostly be *summaries* of Tom Venuto’s [The Body Fat Solution](http://www.thebodyfatsolution.com/) and/or [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (BFFM). I highly recommend reading either or both of these books. I listened to the Body Fat Solution while doing C25K in Round 1, and it was an extraordinary book. For Round 2, I’ll be working my way through BFFM, hopefully about a chapter or two a week. I hope that these daily reading materials will stir up a nice discussion and help us to make reasonable goals and healthy diet and exercise choices. If you aren’t sure where to start for picking out good meal plans or exercise routines, then hopefully these posts and discussions will help you find something that’s right for you. If nothing seems like a good fit

I know that a lot of people already have their own diets and exercise routines picked out. By all  means

Another thing that will be kind of new this time will be weekly check-in posts. In Round 1, I will put up a status update post to remind us to fill in our stats. These posts will also be a great place for us to ask more questions or post our frustrations or breakthroughs.

**Final Note**

Please, start off slow and do things safely. The last thing any of us want is to see anyone get injured. There’s no rush here, this is a slow and steady climb to your goals. All you have to do is take it one step at a time, and keep an eye on your progress as you go. The results will follow.",,False,self,False,t3_e5xit

How are we all doing today? So tonight I was going to go climbing and I will be attempting to climb something difficult that I have been working on for a week or so now. In preparation I ate a few more calories yesterday and won't be doing anything but some light yoga before climbing to get a nice warmup. 

Do you do anything different before going for a goal? Try and get more sleep? Maybe eat a bit more? Let us know!

1354206404.0,13zz4f,[Goal Setting] What do I want?,hellohowdyhi,18,1,8,"The creation of goals is actually a very abstract concept. Goals are simply a manifestation of the underlying questions are the root of humanity. Why am I here? What do I want? How do I want to live my life? We are all seeking answers to these fundamental questions. Goal setting is just a means of answering these questions. 

Whenever I think about goal setting, ordered in what I consider to be important: 

* Physical - my physical health is my #1 priority. 
* Family - relationships with my wife
* Financial - financial stability
* Professional - winning the rat race
* Projects - development projects in things I find interesting that have potential
* Hobbies - golf

So sit down and think about how your life breaks down. Students might only have three divisions: health

* Physical - maintain a healthy weight, be in the best shape of my life on my 40th birthday.
* Family - spend quality time with my wife
* Financial - pay off all my debts
* Professional - make partner
* Projects - work on professional blog
* Hobbies - shoot in the 70s.

Take some time. Write them down. Leave them alone for a day or so and come back to them. Once these generalized desires are documented

So your first step is to think about the questions again in the context of the divisions of your life.

[A link to a different sort of progress post I made in /r/loseit recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/rbohx/progress_f30_6_months_of_calorie_counting_and_a/)

I'm structuring this progress post similarly to my intro post.

This was my second round.  It feels really great to have completed TWO whole rounds

**Round 6 Starting Stats:**

* Age 30
* Female
* Height: 5'6""
* Starting weight (this round): 194 lbs (Note: in Round 5 I went from 223-195


**Goal vs. End of Round 6 Stats:**


* 90 days Weight Loss -  **Goal:** 24 lbs.
* Weekly Weight Loss Average -  **Goal:**  1.5-2 lbs
* Weekly Exercise - **Goal:**  Cardio (Running) 3 times/week, Strength Training 1 time/2 weeks, *(Over cardio goal by 1x/week, under strength training by 1x/week)*
* Miscellaneous Fitness - **Goal:**  Run a nonstop 5K on a track/outside
* Mile Pace - **Goal:**  &lt; 8:30, *(Achieved!  Improved from starting pace of 9:14/6.5mph)*
* Nonstop 5K Time - **Goal:**  &lt; 30:00
* Farthest Nonstop Distance &amp; Time - **Goal:**  8 miles, 1:08:16, *(Did not achieve goal, but believe I probably could do this if I wanted to.  Decreased time to run same distance by 2 minutes and 21 seconds)*

**My Thoughts on This Round of 90 Days Goal**

So, but not all.  When I participated in Round 5, I met all of my goals, so I definitely had to battle some disappointment and a lot of psychological road blocks this round.  

I don't know...it seemed like this last fall and during my first 3 months of real dieting the weight came off pretty easily, but I do want others to know that I really struggled at times this round.

On to the results...well, I'm really starting to feel like a different person.  I'm within 5 lbs of the thinnest I've been in over a decade, so that's pretty incredible.  I can wear normal/non-plus size clothes again, for the first time in probably 8 or 9 years.  I have been less self-conscious and finally enjoying shopping for (and wearing!) cute clothes again, although with about 20 lbs left to shed I'm very hesitant to buy too many new clothes right now.  First, it needs to be an incentive to continue losing weight, and also

Anyway, so that really feels great.  I wrestle with telling people how much I've lost, because on the one hand, saying ""I've lost 50 lbs"" really quantifies the hard work, but on the other, it makes me cringe to acknowledge I was carrying around that much extra weight on my frame.  I'm not proud of the fact that I was fat for so long, but I guess at least I can try and disengage from that and be happy with where I am now.

After (what felt like) stagnating through most of January and February (despite still counting calories and working out on schedule), I started focusing on what I DID want to be (i.e. counting down to my goal weight).  I guess once I got closer to my goals I needed to re-envision what I wanted to ""end"" to look like.  

I also really started taking better care of myself, I don't feel as...hypocritical, perhaps?...about taking care of those details.

Lastly...pretty thrilled to report I went from being obese (yikes!) to overweight for my BMI.  Whether or not I'll be considered healthy at my goal weight for my BMI is another matter

Ooooh, is based on numbers, and the FitBit provides them in spades.  Of most help has been the total daily calories burned measurement, and the most fascinating has been the sleep tracker.  I highly recommend it if you're a serious numbers dieter like me.

**About My Diet and Philosophy**

I use [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/karebearwsu) for calorie tracking (feel free to add me, as well as [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com/user/karebearwsu/profile) to track my runs. 

I have been going for runs on my treadmill 2-4 days per week (muscle soreness and time permitting). I usually go for a total of about 45-75 minutes, or speed.  On days I work out, I usually eat back most of my calories.  I know not everyone does this, but I find the non-workout days I find to be much more challenging, so this helps me stay sane.

I lost a significant amount of weight about 8 years ago (around 35 lbs)

I'm a firm believer in moderation and not doing anything so drastic as to not be sustainable.  My biggest challenges are juggling my other responsibilities (full-time student, and then developing long-lasting healthy eating habits in maintenance.  I tend to struggle more with portion sizes than food choices.

I am DEAD this morning.  I woke up at 5a to get to my 6am Crossfit Foundations classes.  Suffice to say I am so outta shape.  I was last in everything.  I threw up when I left.  BUT Im excited!  Im just looking forward to being *strong*

Today's topic is: **Diets**.  &amp;I am stealing from #4's intro post:

We have people following all kinds of diets here

* Don't diet

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over

* Don't deprive yourself

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I know first hand how difficult it is to transition into healthy eating habits.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  I know that eating can cause anxiety and stress--especially when doing something new.  I urge to stray away from dangerous dieting (such as a extremely low caloritic intake diets) that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind

Personally

Now...!  Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

The cravings keep coming. I don't know how long I can hold them back. We have held out for 31 days now. Our supplies are running low and our constitution is nil. One day at a time. I keep telling myself this. One day at a time.

So we go through our days attempting to follow some sort of structure of diet and exercise. We do this because we want to achieve our goal. Is there something that you do daily to help with reaching your goals? Do you try and drink cold water before giving into hunger? Do you always make sure to have some gum in your purse for the cravings? Let us know!

Also, I think I am going to take a few days off of working out. My tendonitis flared up in my elbow and I really dont want to have to deal with this and climbing so I am hoping I can kick it in the ass with a week or two of rest. Its about time for a rest week also because even my vacation from work was a climbing trip :P. The only problem is I will have to adjust my eating habits to reflect being lazy for a week. Maybe its time to do some running instead.

1317305286.0,kva0z,[COLLEGIATE] Bi-Weekly post #1,wolfbaden6,17,1,19,"Hello

A little bit about me first:

* 21 years old
* Senior criminal justice major
* 6' 2""
* 246 lbs.
* Runner in the making

I've always been overweight, especially because we are all in similar situations.

Let's get down to brass tacks: it's Thursday. Cool. Yeah. So what? Let me rephrase like my mostly-alcoholic roommates would say it: ""**IT'S THIRSTYYYYYYYY THURSDAYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!** Woo

My roommates are stereotypical college bros. I'm unfortunately *very* aware of that. Regardless, poor decisions, and general debauchery. Between the coeds partying in hot and dark basements, the fraternities forcing every last drop of alcohol down their new pledges' throats, and the underage kids sneaking in a bottle of cheap vodka into their dorms, many students are drinking. There are a handful of exceptions who may have Friday exams, work, but the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to avoid alcohol on a Thursday in college.

What many people fail to consider when it comes drinking is just how detrimental it is to your health and your 90 days progress. I'm not going to teach you all about blacking out, etc. I'm not here to do that. I am here; however, to illuminate just how bad alcohol is for you. Let's look at some numbers:

Drink|||||||||||||||||||kCalories
-------------------------------
Keystone light----------103 per 12 oz

Coors light--------------104 per 12 oz

Miller light---------------96 per 12 oz

Natural light-------------95 per 12 oz

Smirnoff vodka-----------97 per 1.5 oz shot

Jagermeister-------------154 per 1.5 oz shot

Jack Daniels-------------122 per 1.5 oz shot

Clearly, no. I take that back. That *pales* in comparison to what might actually go in one night.

Let's take a look at what a typical thirsty Thursday may look like for a college student who likes to drink (using examples from the list I provided):

* 8 Natural Lights
* 1 Coors Light
* 2 shots of Jagermeister
* 1 Jack and Coke (1.5 oz Jack and 10 oz of Coca Cola)

::

* Natural Lights = 8 x 95
* Coors Light = 1 x 104
* Jagermeister = 2 x 154
* Jack and Coke = 122 + 121 (for the Coca Cola)

::

760 + 104 + 308 + 243

=

1415

1415 calories.

Let that sink in for a minute.

1415 calories in a night of drinking.

That does not even include the pizza, gyro, or whatever food many students like to get when they're trying to sober up a little.

One night of drinking may almost be or exceed the recommended daily caloric intake for an adult.

I'm not telling you to not go out and drink; I'm not your RA

Good luck to all of you in this upcoming weekend!

Since I have started doing this I have had people comment on these statuses telling me to stop posting things like this, hate seeing me trying to better myself? 

People don't seem to mind posts like ""omg I drank so much vodka last night I am dying today lol"" yet I post about how hard that 5 mile run was and people lose their shit. I understand constant posts about anything can get irritating to see but I post maybe one fitness related post a week.

The only conclusion I come to each time I think about this is people hate being reminded that they are sat on their arses doing nothing and seeing you out there putting in VERY hard work to make yourself look better intimidates them and makes them feel bad.

sorry about this ranty post I am just sick of people telling me to stop posting things that I am very proud of.

Why do you want to be healthier? -- Do you want to be healthy for your family?  Do you want to lose weight for upcoming bikini season? (Don't we all?)  Do you want to gain strength to be able to complete Tough Mudder?  

Why do you want to be here? -- Have you tried to lose weight on your own and failed without a support system?  Do the real people in your life not support you?  Do you just like talking about fitness/running/yourself with other people online?

The Fitocracy challenges tell me that I wasn't that bad compared to the others, 3rd in the push-up (4835 push-ups) and boot camp challenge, 5th when it comes to running distance (171.5 km), 6th for bench press (76 kg), 9th for deadlift (110 kg) and overall 9th which is, looking at the competition pretty good. What I learned from participation here and constant chest pain, sometimes Fitocracy does not help me. I optimized my workout to gain points

I always saw 90dg as a way to improve myself and besides my back problems I was mostly here to improve my body imagine. With different results. And while I lost my overweight, have now a stylist with a name and do this and that to feel better about myself, I do not really feel that good about myself. Quite confusing actually if you think about it, because honestly I am sure I am now looking better than ever. This is something I do have to work on, for this round (7) particular to go out of my shell and meet people, be more social, and surely to improve the communication with my wife. The situation at home is, as I have a lively daughter and an exhausted wife. She is due at the end of August and we are expecting a boy.

I ate paleo / low carb.  Avoided eating grains except for beer, and Mentally I felt so much better.  I got off my meds due to my change in diet, and resulted in greater self image and self confidence.

I lost weight, my overall sense of self has improved.  

I fell off track a few times, I will be outside more often, more active, and feeling more confident.

The next 90 days will incorporate original goals, will be eating more local fresh food!

Can't believe it's the end of round six already :D

This was my first round and I wanted to lose 20lbs and feel better about myself and maybe learn to run...

I managed to do all of that! I feel awesome

* DIET: I stopped eating like shit. I don't drink any soda or fizzy drinks or any fake juice. I largely stopped eating processed foods - basically if it's in a box

* EXERCISE: I took up jogging/walking in the beginning

* Life: I was unhappy, worked harder at Uni and spent time doing things I enjoy. This all made me happier. I also quit smoking because it didn't make me happy I was just addicted - it fucking sucked at first but now I have no interest in it. 

STATS: Before is in the brackets: 


*Weight: [166.6] 140.4 (26.2lb loss!) 

*Waist: [29.8inches] 26.5

*Hips: [39.5] 38

*Boobs: [36.6] 34

Thanks r/90daysgoal - I couldn't have done it without your support! 

EDIT: Also I would highly recommend MyFitnessPal or whatever charting tool you like - count every damn calorie you put in your mouth and be real with yourself about it and the weight will come off in no time.

Got your goals in your mind? Are they up close and personal? Do you REALLY **WANT** to acheive them? Good. :)

Now I want to focus on the fact that there WILL be so very many things that will come up and entice you away from acheiving those goals. There will be SO many reasons and excuses that will come between you and the ONLY thing that will keep you working toward them will be your word. I would like to invite all of you to both give AND honor your word toward your commitments and goals this round. :) If you are ready to do that give your word to your commitments in the comments below!

**Want to know what it looks like when you honor your word and just do it if for NO OTHER REASON than because you said that you would?**

These 90days saw my through some ups and downs. I started out at a plateau that felt like it lasted forever and a half. This seemed to be a theme over the past 3 months. 

I also started weight lifting which I have now fallen in love with. I am going to start Stronglifts this week now that I have gotten over my paralyzingly fear of the co ed weight room and I'm no longer restricted to 5lb dumbbells in the ladies section.

For cardio my plan was originally to train for a 10k over these 90 days but I was getting a lot of pain and decided to maintain my 5k running as I had just completed C25k right before the 90 days started. I will probably start training for a 10k run in February as there is a big run in my city that I would like to do in April. I did however successfully maintain my 5k runs! 

As my plateaus lasted longer so did my urges to sabotage myself. So I turned to keto in an effort to break my carb addiction. I lasted for just over 2 weeks. I have been doing low carb instead (under 100grams). Although I understand keto is awesome for some

For now

My goals for the next 90 days will be to continue with my weight lifting. Start training for a 10k in April and hopefully lose 1lb/week. Looking forward to joining everyone again for the next round!

1318358150.0,l8kef,[RUNNERS] Topic: Preventing and Treating Shin Splints,katiekatums,16,0,6,"Hello runners! I hope you've had some great runs so far!

Today's topic is shin splints

***

**What are shin splints?**

Shin splints are pains in your legs below the knee. The pain usually develops on the front outside part (anterior shin splints) or lower inside part of the leg (medial or posterior shin splints). (Illustrated [here](http://www.kennethsdivecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/shin-splints-treatement.jpg).)

Shin pain can occur when you start a new walking or running routine, or make changes to your stride. The pain is caused by small tears in your leg muscles that develop because of a muscle imbalance in your legs. If you feel shin pain while running, slow down or walk the rest of the way. Treat your pain before you continue your running routine. Shin splints will go away over time as you build up your leg muscles, but running through the pain will not help.


***

**Preventing shin splints**

Before running
&gt; * **Shoe type:** [Make sure you're wearing the right type of running shoes for your foot type.](http://running.about.com/od/shoesapparelandgear/ht/runningshoe.htm) Get your shoes professionally fitted at a running shoe store. General sporting goods stores will not usually be able to give you much help when picking out your shoes. You may need special shoes to help with [overpronation or underpronation/supination](http://media.summitmedicalgroup.com/media/db/relayhealth-images/pronatio.jpg).
&gt; * **Shoe age:** Replace your running shoes every 250-400 miles.
&gt; * **Heel walking:** Before running, stop and stretch your shins. (Source: [ehow](http://www.ehow.com/list_7262222_warm_up-exercises-shin-splints.html))
&gt; * **Toe walking:** Before running, for about 25 yards. Next, rotate your legs from the hip and walk 25 yards on your tip-toes with your toes pointed outward. And finally, rotate your legs inward and walk 25 yards with your toes pointed inwards. For each of these, take short, controlled steps. (Source: [ehow](http://www.ehow.com/list_7262222_warm_up-exercises-shin-splints.html))
&gt; * **Warm up:** Walk or jog at an easy pace for 5-10 minutes before you increase your speed.
&gt; * **Stretch:** [Stretch your legs](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_1/126.shtml) after you warm up.

During your run
&gt; * **Proper stride:** Pay careful attention to your stride. Do not overstride. Your foot should land under your body
&gt; * **Avoid hills:** Avoid running on uneven surfaces and very hilly routes. If you plan to run in a hilly area
&gt; * **Avoid hard surfaces:** Avoid running on hard surfaces
&gt; * **Increase intensity slowly:** Increase your distance and speed slowly
&gt; * **Mix up your intensity:** Include a mix of high intensity and low intensity training
&gt; * **Leg warmers:** During your run

After running
&gt; * **Stretch:** [Stretch your legs](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_1/126.shtml) again after you finish your run.
&gt; * **Rest:** Make sure you're giving yourself enough rest in between runs. Your muscles need time to build and repair.
&gt; * **Ice:** After running
&gt; * **Foam roll:** Foam rolling is great for working out tension in your muscles. For some suggested rolls for calves and shins
&gt; * **Exercise:** On your rest days


***

**Exercises and stretches to prevent shin splints**

Shin stretches
&gt; * **Standing shin stretch:** Stand with your feet together. Place the top of one foot on the floor slightly behind you and drag your foot forward until you feel a stretch in your shins. Hold for 15-30 sec. Repeat for other foot. (Like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_134.jpg).) (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))
&gt; * **Kneeling shin stretch:** Kneel on the floor with your toes pointed straight out behind you

Calf stretches (should help with anterior shin splints)
&gt; * **Toes-out toe raises:** Stand with heels together
&gt; * **Toes-in toe raises:** Stand with big toes together
&gt; * **Toe flexes:** Place your heels on the edge of a step, then slowly release. Repeat 10 times. (Source: [about.com](http://walking.about.com/od/exercises/a/shintoeraise.htm))
&gt; * **Standing toe-up calf stretch:** Stand with one knee bent and the other foot held straight out in front of you. Leaning on your bent knee for support
&gt; * **Standing heel-balk calf stretch:** Stand with your legs split as if you were going to do a lunge. Keeping both feet planted on the floor

Achilles stretches (should help with medial shin splints)
&gt; * **Standing Achilles stretch:** Stand with one leg forward and crouch forward like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_131.jpg) until you feel a gentle stretch in your Achilles. Hold for 15-30 sec. Repeat for the other leg. (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))
&gt; * **Kneeling Achilles stretch:** Kneel on the ground

Foam rolling
&gt; * **[Foam roll all the things](http://www.realjock.com/article/1218)**

***

**Treating shin splints**

If you have shin splints, or completely stop running for a few days, . Your muscles need time to rest and recover. By continuing to run with shin splints, your muscles will not be able to repair themselves and the shin splints won't get better. During your recovery break, ice your shins for 10-20 min at a time and perform light stretches. Consider swimming or biking to continue conditioning your body without placing too much stress on your legs. If you continue to run at a lower intensity, avoid running on hills and hard surfaces. When your legs are feeling better, you can gradually reintroduce hills and hard trails into your routine.

I hope to lose another 20lbs by June 3rd, which is when my and my sister's birthdays are, and we're going to the beach.


[Diet]
I'm lucky because I'm very strong willed.  I started a [Meal Plan](http://kthanx.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Meal-plan-1024x405.jpg) in January, but still making it healthy and diet-friendly.  I haven't had any issues with temptation, and when we go out for happy hour or something, I DD, so I don't tack on added alcohol or snack calories (bar food FTL).  I'll have a few drinks a week, but I have a large calorie deficit due to my work outs, so one or even two beers in one day doesn't ruin me.

Also, I can't eat as MUCH as I used to (yay portion control!), and I choose healthier options than my boyfriend does, but they are definitely still ""cheats"" on my diet.  I feel these cheat meals are important, so I don't get ""fed up"" with ONLY diet food and go off and eat something awful, then regret it later.  


[Exercise]
I go to the gym every morning and do the Elliptical.  I've played with length of time, and still feel a burn when I leave every morning.  I've noticed the back of my legs are looking nice and smooth, as opposed to the dimples they used to have... so yay for that.

While practicing last night for TKD and the other week ago for climbing I got a chance to work with 2 different great people. We did some pretty serious training together and it was such an amazingly positive experience. We were motivating each other and critiquing and just really working on the skills at hand. 

I realized it wasnt so much the people themselves but their attitude towards the work that made the absolute difference. They are dedicated and motivated to work hard and especially not afraid of hard work or failure. Their attitude affected me and hopefully vice versa. 

So my question to you this morning is how is your attitude during your workouts? Do you keep a posititve hard working attitude all of the time? Do you think it might be worth taking a few minutes to meditate to bring your attitude around to have a more positive workout and experience? Also, and have a good time. Its just a workout. 

Tell us what you are up to today? Anything fun in the name of fitness? I got some yoga and some rock climbing but nothing exciting. Let us know!

1364900858.0,1bibi7,[Runners] - Week 2 - Off to the Races,dinosaurdinosrawr,14,1,49,"Good morning

It is getting to be race season, or one of your own?  

One of the biggest things involved in a race is **race day prep.** This is something that might be of interest to runners who haven’t ever done a race before and aren’t sure what to expect

Do you have a routine for the days following up to the race?  Everyone is different, don’t fret - here are some things to think about prior to your first race.  Just keep in mind that some of these tips depend on personal preference, and hopefully these steps toward general preparedness make the morning of your first race or two go smoothly and be less stressful.  

**Before the Race**

* Know the course:  look up a course map online, you might want to get there extra early on the morning of the race.  Depending on where the course is, you might be able to drive it ahead of time - for my 10 miler a few weeks ago, I wasn’t familiar with the area so I drove the course (and immediately wanted to back out because I didn’t realize it would be so hilly......).  If it’s a shorter race, like a 5K, you might be able to incorporate the route onto one of your training runs.  Regardless of whether you check out the map, drive it, making yourself a little familiar with the area ahead of time can definitely quell some of your race-day jitters
* Outfit:  Do you know what you’ll be wearing the day of the race?  Have you worn it before?  Race day is definitely not the best time to test out a new pair of shoes or shorts or shirt - you want to make sure that you’re comfortable and that you know you won’t have to worry about chafing or loose elastic on shorts.  
* Diet and Hydration:  The morning of a race is also not a time to eat something different than usual - nobody likes a bellyache mid-run, but if that will be the case then I would suggest you try out eating food before some training runs.  I usually go on an empty stomach, but before long runs (and races) I usually have a tablespoon or two of peanut butter about an hour beforehand.  Same with what you eat during the week leading up to the race (or at least the night before) - the idea is to make race day just like any other day, but faster ;)  Also, be sure to be hydrated, but this kind of goes for all the time.
* Bibs:  Consider where you’ll pin your bib when figuring out your outfit - make sure that you’ll be able to have it in the right area that they want you to so that it works properly.  Also bring safety pins for it just in case they run out or don’t have any... most huge races have packet pick-ups in advance and you’ll be able to either get safety pins there or find out if you need your own

**During the Race**

* Fuel:  This likely won’t come into play until you do longer races, brands, types... on race day you know you don’t want something that will make you want to hurl, so it’s best to stick with what works!
* Hydration:  Some races offer both sports drinks and water - try to grab whatever you usually drink during runs... again
* Pace:  You might be tempted to start off faster than your goal pace - don’t!  The energy of the crowd and adrenaline you’ll experience will give you a boost
* **Race how you train**:  this is the main take-home point for this... the point of your training up until this point was to build the skills you need to get through the race, wear, pace, etc. - plays a role in your training runs and then comes into play on race day.  Trust your training - that’s what it’s there for!  

**After the Race**

* Bask in glory:  Races are amazing experiences - you push yourself more than you ever thought possible and the energy of everyone there is amazing.  It’s absolutely fantastic.  I would absolutely suggest signing up for a race to anyone who hasn’t done one before - it doesn’t have to be a long race

Alrighty

* Races coming up?  If so
*  If you have one
* Any tips for those who don’t have much race experience?
* Greatest race experience (could be a PR

Happy running :D

It's Friday!  And that means almost the end of the first week!  So let's talk for a minute about **WEEKENDS**.  For a lot of people weekends are a hard time to stay on track.  So what's your plan for weekends?  Will you use them as off/cheat time?  Or will you keep to your same weekly schedule?  Will you try to make up for bad decisions during the week? 

If you plan to use weekends as a cheat, try to make up for it somewhat with exercise.  I'm not saying you can out-exercise a bad diet, but if you aren't working, chances are that you have more time to get in your workouts.  So spend a few extra minutes this weekend burning calories so you can order that beer guilt-free or have a healthy dessert after dinner.

Good morning everyone!

Today is day 4 of our journey and we have a few different things to make a note of today. First off how is your day today? Doing anything interesting in the name of fitness? What do you plan to do today to further yourself towards your goals? Let us know!

We had toyed with some groups before in the past and it turns out to be a modding nightmare when we tried to split it up enough. We found that with a few larger groups though we are able to help more people by being more consistent. In these groups you will find posts for [Runners](http://redd.it/149bd3)

I may not be a woman but I am happy to see that so many are able to band together to work on bettering themselves. It is awesome to see. If you fit into one of these categories you are more than welcome to join into the discussions.

Also if you have not done so please check out the sidebar specifically to sign up for this new round of 90days.

Now for some basic info we want to let you know about:

* If you are a member of Fitocracy or want a want a website to help you track your workouts join Fitocracy. We have some challenges going on this round and you can find the information [in this post.](http://redd.it/13z130)



* There are going to be some goal setting posts. Definitely look into these and see if you can get yourself setup with some obtainable simple goals. I highly recommend this. 

* Feel free to also participate in the [weekly challenge](http://redd.it/146k6h)! 

Go forth and be fit!

1354285681.0,141w5g,[Goal Setting] What goals will get you what you want?,hellohowdyhi,16,1,1,"“Failing to plan is planning to fail”

So now you have a [conceptual idea of what you want](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/13zz4f/goal_setting_what_do_i_want). It’s time to break that conceptual idea into an implementation plan. You want to break complexity down into small, walk for 1 minute. If you can’t walk for 1 minute, then stand in your driveway for 5 minutes. Everything should be broken down into steps that are impossible to fail at. The concept is very [Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen). The first step is to create goals. 

Goal achievement consists of three basic steps. 

1. Create and Document [SMART goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
2. Break the goals down into detailed plans. Break them down as far as you need to ensure success. 
3. Execute the plans exactly as detailed. Hold the line. 

Create your goals using the SMART method. Make sure each goal has every element documented. 

* Specific - Be very specific about the goal. 
* Measurable - Have every goal be pass/fail with a distinct measurement to determine success.
* Attainable - Make the goal something that can be achieved. 
* Relevant - It’s gotta be something you WANT. Without desire
* Timely - Put a date on it. Heck

Creating goals are all about timelines. A wise person once said “There are no unrealistic goals

5 Years, 1 Week, 1 Day

Let’s do an example by looking at one of my life divisions. 

* Physical - maintain a healthy weight, be in the best shape of my life on my 40th birthday.

So what goals can I set that would achieve these attributes? I believe that participating in races is a great way to ensure I am running enough, that’s about 4 races per year, one per quarter. They don’t have to match up directly with my 90 day goal completion dates. 

For 2013

What are your goals? 

Tomorrow we will talk about implementing the plan to achieve the goals and breaking it down!",self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/141w5g/goal_setting_what_goals_will_get_you_what_you_want/

**My Goals**

- Get under 50% body fat **achieved** (according to my home scale. at the gym

- Lose 25 lbs **not achieved** - 19.5 lbs lost

My setbacks included a back injury (healed now), and getting infections from the surgery. I am healed from the surgery and infections but my stamina and energy are gone right now.

I followed a ketogenic diet for most of it. The first time I was on it, once I figured that out and went back on, my issues went away and so did the pain. It's much easier to avoid the carbs when there's a pain principle associated!

For the next round I am going to work even harder towards my goals since I can see results now and I'm motivated. The Fibro could be an issue but it's not right now and I refuse to stress about something that I can't control right now. I'm also focusing more on sleeping because it's something I just can't seem to do these days. As well

""I was always fat from the age of about 12-13

About 2 years after that I was looking a LOT better and my outlook on life had completely changed. I had little fat on me and my muscles were a LOT bigger. The summer 2 years after starting I decided to imitate a guy known online as ""[zyzz](http://images.smh.com.au/2011/08/13/2555915/art-353-pg5-zyzz-200x0.jpg)"", he was a damn nice guy. I had joked around with friends about doing this for a while but had never actually decided to go for it. So I went to a festival wearing some fairly long shorts and a slightly tight shirt and a friend decided to bring along some short shorts as a joke, didn't really want to go for the whole just short shorts thing but a load of girls decided that they wanted to see my body and as a result off came the shirt and on went some short shorts. For the rest of that festival (4 day event) I walked round in nothing but short shorts and trainers. I felt like god, my ego was massive and the attention was incredible. 

It was so very different to everyone making fat jokes behind my back, but it doesn't work like that. 

One thing that I do dislike is the way many now see me. People assume I'm some uneducated meathead who obviously has done steroids. This isn't true, I'm not as blindly ignorant as many perceive me to be. Doesn't really bother me but it's the main source of my dislike for people with unaesthetical bodies who throw insults at me, since I assume that they're jealous of the hard work and dedication I've put in for my body. As a result it's made me dislike anyone who supports ""fat can be healthy"" campaigns since they're just damn wrong. This is the only real negative aspect of the whole weight loss.


Another story I can give you is about a very close friend of mine. She was in an abusive relationship with someone who called her fat on a daily basis and although it didn't get to the point of hitting it was damn close. She was overweight

Every morning I would see her at 6am and we would exercise

All the other stories are just about people losing weight and looking/feeling better with themselves and getting compliments but no real stories. So far I've helped I think it's about 15 people lose weight

* 1 small box raisins

* 1 cinammon stick
* 1/2 a lemon or lime
* Cinammon powder
* Handful of crushed walnuts
* Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Basically, leave the bottom intact for stuffing--just make sure to take out core/seeds.  

Take your 1t of coconut oil and shove it inside of the apple.  Then, put a generous squeeze of lemon/lime juice over the apple.

Place in the oven for 20 minutes

For me, I totally fucked up the bench presses yesterday and I am not sure why. It really annoys me as I was sure I could add some weight, yet I couldn't even make the repetitions with the lighter weight. The last set however did work much better. I am a bit confused, am I holding the bar in a wrong way sometimes (too much weight on one side)? Going to add some marks probably. I seem to be losing a bit steam trainingwise which really gets on my mood. Still can't run which also gets on my mood. Today would have been running day and I have to be looking for a replacement training. I used to do some squats but maybe even start quitting those (fuck my leg). Ah well. Laura is still very sick and needy which adds another layer of stress and non-sleep. At least me and my wife seem to get along better. Oh, Germany did play a perfect qualification with their final win yesterday and even more important, was able to resist eating chips while watching the game (my wife did).

1317412437.0,kwt3v,As per request: Biking AMA.,Somedamnguy,14,1,8,"I am a competitive cyclist and professional bike mechanic and enthusiast. I'm also involved in a local group of middle-aged folks who have just started biking

Biking is my way to get cardio exercise; I hate running/jogging, and unless you have awesome form it just looks awkward. Biking on the other hand is low to no impact, you get to sit down while exercising, you get to go fast, and it supports your weight so within an hour or so you can get to a point where you don't look awkward and can feel graceful on a bike.

Biking is particularly useful for those of you who are looking to lose weight. Within 60 days, it is easier to control your heart rate.

For weight loss you should train at your lactic acid threshold, but don't train with it, 5 miles into a 10mph will be a lot harder to do than 15 with a tailwind. Instead your training should focus on keeping yourself at that exertion level for as long as you can, if you can only manage to ride 5 miles your first week that's fine.

For best results pick up a heart-rate monitor at a bike/running shop, one of my riders was pushing 97 BPM just standing in his kitchen making dinner, yet after a month of biking his heart rate was 80 while doing the same task.

If you do train with a heart-rate monitor make sure that you don't compare your data with others. Everybody's heart works differently, and another of our team-mates is at 165, but we reach those rates at the same speed.

The bike you use really doesn't matter when you are just starting out, you can fit in a size too big or too small but if you walk around in it for too long it's going to suck. 
If you are noticing that you have knee pain before you are getting tired it is likely because your saddle is not the right height. 

So with that out of the way feel free to ask me anything.

**EDIT:** I've decided to join you with my own 90 day goal: 100 miles in 5 hours 30 minutes.

We've talked a bit about diets over in the Daily Goal posts, is a huge part of weight loss.  Exercise is important, no doubt, but you can't out exercise a bad diet.

The easiest part of a diet, lunch, or dinner.  It's planned out and I know what I'm eating.  Snacking, however...

How do you guys deal with **snacking**?  It can be at work, where you have all your food at your finger tips.  It can also be at a party or someone else's house (family, etc), who might not have the best of food choices available.  What do you do?  How do you manage it?  Do you bring your own snacks all the time?  Do you bring your own snacks some times?  How do you deal with snacking at home?  Do you have any tips or tricks?

This topic might bleed a little into emotional eating, then by all means, go ahead and talk about it.

I hope everyone has a great day!

Welcome to Round 10! If this is your first round with 90dg

**Who we are**

Women Losing Weight (WLW) is a group within [/r/90daysgoal] (http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/) that is aimed specifically towards women. We are a dedicated &amp; passionate group of ladies that are after the same goal: to better our lives. Some of us are trying to lose weight. Some of us are trying to gain. But all of us are in need of support &amp; motivation and we hope you will find that here with us. WLW is run by the fantastic [/u/uninvitedthirteenth] (http://www.reddit.com/user/uninvitedthirteenth), [/u/dinosaurdinosrawr] (http://www.reddit.com/user/dinosaurdinosrawr/).  We’ll be posting WLW threads on Mondays (nano, but I’m subbing for her this week while she is on vacation!), Wednesdays (unin), and Fridays (myself).

**What we do**

WLW does not have a set goal within our time. Our initiative is to encourage &amp; help one another on our journey towards change. We want to target gender specific issues that you could be dealing with during this round. Ideally

**You**

Day 01 is always, I want today to be a casual, welcoming &amp; open day of discussion. Let us know who you are. Have you decided on a plan of action/ end goal? If so, what is it? If you haven't thought about it, please take the time to do so today. Let's kickstart this round off on the right foot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them :D

How is everyone doing today? I know Valentine's Day is a lesser holiday but it can still be plagued by chocolate. Just remember to do what you think is necessary with it! If you dont need it then stray away or make sure to let the significant other know. On the other hand it is a small holiday and a nice dinner with honey bear might be in order! If you do just compensate a little with some extra activity. It will all work out in the end. 

I personally have a nice 3 hour climbing session planned for tonight haha I am more in love with the gym plastic than any women currently so I plan to spend it there. I figure anyone else there will be single too!

Anyways go forth and be lovey dovey.

I hope you are all having a fantastic start to your week.  I am about to head to the gym myself.  Getting a much later start than normal

Today's topic is **Go-To Meals**.  Now that we are a week into our new year

For me, and I can bring it with me to work for lunch if necessary.  One of my other secrets is to cook up a lot of chicken, cut it up, and then put it in the freezer in individual containers.  Then on a night I can grab one, toss it with some veggies and some sort of sauce (usually from a jar), and eat with rice.  Usually super quick/easy during the week, and I can get 2-3 meals out of one container of chicken.

So what about you all?  How are you all doing this fabulous Monday?",self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self5,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/16483j/wlw_january_7_2013/

How do you deal with temptations?  What sorts of things tempt you?  Is it food

What happens is simple - this is the week where the excitement of doing something new wears off. Every one of your friends and family have seen the changes you made and it's become normal to them. It's no longer exciting to wake up every morning and do something new because it's not new anymore - it's your life now.

But that's where your mind tricks you. Let's get something straight. It's easier NOT to go to the gym. It's easier to NOT eat healthy. It's easier NOT to have the self discipline to do that daily work to achieve a long term goal. But to quote JFK

Hold that line. 

Last week

**This Week**

* Mon - Lunch meeting with pizza. Must make sure to run to hit my calorie goals and I am going to bring a protein bar to eat about 30 minutes before. 
* Tue - normal day
* Wed - Lunch out with the wife and kid so I will need to run that afternoon. 
* Thu - Lunch with old colleague. Lift that day. 
* Fri - normal day + running.
* Sat - nothing exciting. Maybe some yoga.

Alright ladies, show off your culinary creations &amp; share recommendations. 

So my contribution to this edition of FF is [Sausage Stuffed Tomatoes](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m87jmiaD4k1qbuha4o1_500.jpg).For all you Paleo people out there

**Ingredients**

* 1lb Mild Italian Sausage
* 1lb Ground Beef
* Mushrooms
* 1 Green Bellpepper
* 1/2 Onion
* Small can of tomato paste
* 6 *firm* tomatoes

Carefully hollow out the tomatoes.  Save the pulp (?)  from two tomatoes to use later.  Basically, mushrooms&amp; bellpepper until tender.  Then I toss in the tomato paste &amp; .  Basically--its like a pizza stuffed into a tomato.  Fill the tomatoes &amp; sprinkle a bit of cheese on top.  Pop into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes.  Then you may consume without guilt! :D

So how about you?  Get in here &amp; share with the rest of us :) &amp;don't forget to support your fellow WLW'ers!

It's Day 03 &amp; lets get it started on a good note!  Yesterday, some of us are doing it to look good in a bathing suit, and some of us are doing it to add on muscle.  We all may have varying reasons for change but the important thing is that we are all here &amp; in this together.  And so, right now I'd like to share this quote that Ive used before.  I love it.  &amp;I feel like no matter what your situation, you can identify with it.

&gt; I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times

Success is not measured by only winning.  Success is had by the struggle, even in those moments can you find your strength.

&amp;that brings us to today's topic: **Social Situations**.  Oh

So get in here!  Let us know what is going on in your world. How did you do on your goals yesterday?  &amp;as I mentioned in WLW comments yesterday

Is anyone taking any supplements?  I personally take BCAAs, CoQ10, garlic extract, melatonin, fish oil, vitamin D, and vitamin C daily, I have quite the expensive supplement habit.  

I make sure I do plenty of research before trying any supplement.  The first place I go is Silverhydra's [examine.com](http://examine.com)

One of us has been a participating member of 90daysgoal for the past 2 rounds and after seeing how 90days work
The main objective of the project for which we ask for your help is to gain a better understanding of how different attitudes toward physical activity interact together in the adoption and maintenance of a regular physical activity behaviour. A secondary objective is to confirm the validity of some measures in the questionnaires we use. More detailed information about the project is available at the start of the questionnaire to help you understand what your participation implies and to make an enlightened decision about it.  
  
Your task in this research project is to fill this questionnaire, of a duration of 5 minutes. By helping us, you will help to improve the understanding of physical activity adoption and maintenance mechanism. By filling the questionnaires you might get a better insight on your physical activity practice and summary of findings and stats will be presented to the community at various moments in the round.

1333829109.0,ry92x,[PROGRESS] M/25/177 -&gt; 167.8/Weight Lifting,nymeatball,14,1,5,"Happy day 90! The last check in told us to post our own results/progress thread

My 90 days was roughly split into two parts - the first 9 weeks were mostly a ""cut"" where I was focused on losing weight as healthily and quickly as possible

The last 3 weeks I finally bought a real weight set and started a modified version of the ""Starting Strength"" program and I'm currently working through that on a ""bulk"" program.

**Starting Stats/Goals**

Male/177 lbs/6'3""/25 years old

Unknown BF%

* Lose 11 pounds
* Start a consistent workout routine
* Get below 15% body fat
* Be able to do 55 crunches
* Be able to do 15 pushups

**Diet**

My plan for the 90 days was basic, cut that down to no more than 1-2 times per week. 

I was extremely committed to both of these. This entire year I've actually had nothing to drink except water and milk (and the occasional beer/alcohol

In terms of cutting fast food out at lunch, and found out what I could make quickly and easily the night before. Not a whole lot of groundbreaking ideas here, but for completeness:

Breakfast: Whey protein/Milk

Lunch: Wraps (Chicken, Apples, Cottage Cheese, Oranges, Hard Boiled Eggs. Lots and lots of chicken varieties.

Dinner: Chicken. Chili. Pasta. Low carb ""pizzas"" (low carb tortilla + sauce + cheese). Rice. 

Snacks: Apples. Bananas. Lots and lots of whey shakes. 

Overall I think I was successful with my diet because it was really simple. I'd buy something like 20-25 ingredients and just mix and match them. Everything goes with chicken. 

The first 9 weeks was spent on a fairly strict 750-1000 kCal deficit. I was running a roughly 50% protein

The last 3 weeks as I moved over to a more intense weight lifting program I basically reversed my diet, just started eating more of it.

**Exercise**

Started off slow - did some basic at home bodyweight exercises: jumping jacks, squats, crunches, etc. Spent the first 9 weeks doing this along with your basic dumbbell exercises. I don't truly believe it did much in terms of calories burned or muscle gained, but it proved to me that I could stick with a routine for 9 weeks, even if it was ""pointless"". 

Currently i'm in between my third and fourth weeks of the starting strength program. I'm weak as hell

**Results**

No pictures

* Weight: 177 -&gt; 167.8 lbs. My goal was 166. I actually hit the 164.4lb mark back in week 9
* Waist: 34.5"" -&gt; 33""
* Pushups: 0 to 13
* Crunches: 0 to 25 unweighted
* Bench Press: 0 to 3x5 @ 81.8 lbs
* Press: 0 to 3x5 @ 55 lbs
* Squat: 0 to 3x5 @ 108.2 lbs
* Deadlift: 0 to 1x5 @ 182 lbs

**Overall**

Completely awesome 90 days. I think I've definitely made some changes that will stick

1317005048.0,krf5f,[Intro] College student trying to take off the last 30 lbs,,15,1,5,"Hi guys. I am a college student junior (20 y/o) majoring in biology and chemistry. I have been a large kid mainly because my family is from bangladesh (lowest BMI in the world due to poverty) and my mom loved feeding me as a kid. I am very easy going and do what my parents tell me so that resulted in me being babied my whole life.

I was overweight and was made fun of in elementary and middle school. All that changed after I started playing football in highschool. I loved HS and it was ok for me to be fat (playing o-line) and had tons of good friends that I still keep in touch with. Here is where I was the heaviest being 224 (102 kg) and 5'10 (177.8 cm). I tore my ACL and couldn't play my last year. I went on a strict diet of 1000 calories and dropped to 180 (81.6 kg). Over my senior I gained it all back all the way back up to 224 (102 kg) mainly due to the introduction of alcohol. 

I want to be a physician. I cannot imagine telling someone to lose weight for their health while being fat. At the beginning of this year I started to change myself. No more parents doing my laundry

I've managed to lose 30 lbs (13.6 kg). I have progress pics

Let's do it guys. I love and cherish any motherfucker in the gym that is overweight trying to make themselves better. I love seeing overweight people in the gym.

So who am I?  Well--for starters, I started my rocky relationship w/ weightloss since Round 1 of 90 Days Goal.  And let me tell you...weightloss and I?  We fight.  ALOT.  For 24 3/4 years of my life, I didn't have a weight problem.  My weight was consistent.  After losing someone very very dear to me, I suddenly started gaining weight...alot of weight due to binge eating, etc.  And here I am, a year later and about 20 lbs heavier.  And that is what I want to shed--maybe even a few pounds more.  I am now a firm believer that it is alot easier to gain than lose.  With previous rounds, I usually would fall off the wagon.  Not this time.  I am making a commitment to myself and a commitment to the team to stick this through.  And I hope you can do the same.  

Groups are a new idea to 90dg so we don't exactly have a format of how this goes.  But I'd like to start off with a few things:

* Introduce yourself.  Tell us who you are.  Tell us your goals.
* Let us know how you are planning on losing weight.
* Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you on your journey.

Above all, we struggle together.  We also triumph together.  We are here to support and offer advice as we go along.

So let's get the ball rolling today and tell us who you are!  Don't forget to support your fellow 90ers!

We have people following all kinds of diets here

* Don't diet

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, without changing your diet, try tracking *everything* that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over

* Don't deprive yourself

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies.  If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

Ok

What's your plan for your diet this round? Do you have any questions about which diet to follow? Any questions about the diet you're already following? Are you using any websites or apps to help you keep up with your plans?

**Groups!**

So, it's going to get harder to keep up with everyone. You might lose track of who told you about this or that program or who it was that lives in your area. But it can be very motivating to know that others are reading your updates and following your progress, and it can even be a little discouraging as the orangereds start slowing down.

Having a smaller subset of people with similar goals might be an easier way for us to keep track of each other. Starting this round, get familiar with your teammates. Look for their posts in the daily goal threads. Help answer questions that pop up. PM them if you haven't heard from them in a while. And they'll do the same for you. You know that at the very least, this new group of friends is looking over your shoulder and cheering you on. Also, groups can put up posts intended for their teammates using a [TEAM] tag. (For instance, I'll be announcing upcoming fitocracy challenges with the [FITOCRACY] tag.) Depending on the group, you might exchange email addresses or set up an IRC channel. How each group is run is totally up to the group.

[Here is the sign-up sheet for teams.](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodFZWRHZIXzUwTEhsdnBKYXdzeHAtUWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=8) The first page has a few anticipated FAQs, ask them here or message the mods. If you're not sure which groups to join yet, you can hold off until you've got a better idea of what your plans are. If you don't see a group that you want to join, feel free to add a new one.

Monday for me was one of those days...household duties, lower back and shoulders) and as usual it wen't very well.

Nutrition is a different story. One of my colleagues had his birthday meal at work yesterday and I did eat a bit more than usual, with nutrition I still need some more discipline so I have to watch closely what and how much I ate as well as hopping on the scale daily again. Not sure if I have to alter my diet a bit, but we will see once I know how my weight develops.

Round 2 for me was a strange one. I remember when in #1 widdlywabbit stopped and we all went over here and kept going. Back then, ended up with a whole bunch of new people (even got our first troll) and somehow I got the feeling that that fire slowly went out...

What happened? I'd say we lost quite a few people over the holidays

What I would like to see more of in the next round:

- More people talking in the comments and not only talking about workout / nutritiion but whatever is going on in your part of the world

- More people helping out other people

- More posts in general about our questions / experiences / movivation / whatever and those poste by everyone not just moderators. Here should be going on more than the YDG posts

1366111155.0,1cge01,[Runners] - Week 4 - Clothes &amp; Gear,dinosaurdinosrawr,13,0,45,"Good morning

This week, as well!  Sorry for what's about to be an information overload, but hopefully having a lot of this stuff in a centralized place can help those of you who might be newer to running figure out what you need and what you don't.

As spring and summer approaches, but not *too much*.

Let’s talk about **clothing** - what do you typically wear in the summer months in order to be appropriately covered but not overheated?  Keep in mind that your body will heat up when you start running, getting heavier as you sweat more and making you more likely to overheat.  Do you wear any extra accessories, like sweat bands?  And how do you deal with funny weather, like rain and thunderstorms?  Summer is often notorious for bouts of thunder and lightning with no rain, so do you bail on your run at times like those or do you risk it?  

Now, and you can decide if they are appropriate for you to have:

* GPS Watch - very useful if you are a serious runner and want a more accurate summary of your pace, or whatever else that different models offer... however, if you are just starting out and not sure if you really *love* running and want to drop a ton of cash, there are a ton of smartphone apps that you can use, provided you have one.  Some of these include Nike+ and runkeeper.  Alternatively, if you don’t have a smartphone, you can use mapmyrun.com to map out your route to see how far you are going and then just use a watch or whatever else to time yourself.  There are plenty of ways to track your distance without having to spring for a GPS watch!
* Pouch/fanny pack - there are companies that make belts that you can use to carry your stuff in, figure out if you really need it first.  These things are great for carrying your phone if you don’t wear it in an armband, they can carry your ID, car keys, gel packets, etc.  I would say that these are really practical and among the more “necessary” gear for all runners regardless of level, especially if you don’t have zipper pockets in your running clothes.  Sometimes if you have a certain kind of armband for your smartphone (the kind that fully holds the phone as opposed to one that just kind of goes around the outside like a case), so in the morning I ran out to Target on the way to the race and bought an iphone armband so I could use it to hold my phone and ID during the race
* Reflectors and Vest - these are incredibly important if you are running at certain times of day when lighting might make it tough to see, I would absolutely suggest getting something to make sure you are visible and wearing it regardless of weather - anything to make you stand out and as visible as possible so that oncoming cars will see you and give you a wide berth.  If you run on trails, in parks, and on pedestrian-only paths then reflective gear may not be necessarily *as* important.  It’s your call, but just remember that safety is very very important!
* Hydration belt - this really depends on personal preference and individual “ability”.  If you are running distances where you feel you need to drink during your run and you need maybe two bottles instead of just one that you can carry in your hand (or if you find it incredibly annoying to carry a bottle), try a few of these things to see if they’re suitable options:  running while carrying a water bottle in your hand, checking your route for water fountains, “hiding” water bottles along your route (especially if you run a loop).  Running with a hydration belt can be a weird feeling at first - I felt really bouncy during my first run with it, but after a few miles I didn’t even notice it anymore.
* Compression socks/calf sleeves - I haven’t ever used these and can’t really provide any anecdotal evidence about them
* Headphones - I don’t know if this counts as gear or not, and since these have the weird ear-arm thingy they’re great for activity.  They were 5 bucks, and I replace them every couple of months.  They’re also waterproof “sport” headphones, so sweat doesn’t mess them up.  
* [RoadID] (http://www.roadid.com/Common/default.aspx) - in case of an accident, just remember safety first!  Personally, I just take my insurance card and driver’s license and cell phone on all runs in case of emergency, but I might invest in a RoadID in the near future - better safe than sorry!
* Any other gear that I’m missing that you’re wondering about?

Hopefully those of you who are newer to running found this helpful - I know that I was really overwhelmed by what was out there in the beginning and had to ask around a lot to figure out what I actually needed and what I could wait until I had some more mileage under my belt :D  

**Now let’s hear from you

* Feel free to share any fantastic running moments that you may have experienced over the past week - we would love to hear about them!  Alternatively
* What do you wear?  Any add-ons that you don’t wear in winter?
* Weird summer weather:  how do you deal?
* What gear do you use on your runs?  
* Is there anything in particular that you think is necessary for all runners?

It’s possible that others may be noticing those changes, too, which brings us to today’s topic:  **compliments**.

1357052995.0,15ru2f,[Runners] - Week 5 - Stretching and Crosstraining,dinosaurdinosrawr,14,1,18,"Happy New Year

Today’s topics are **stretching** and **crosstraining**.

**Stretching** is something that might affect your running performance - it really helps loosen you up and can help with preventing injuries.  I usually stretch a little bit before I run and for slightly longer after I run, and after a few painful minutes I’m usually feeling better!  I’m not sure about you guys, but I know that I feel like I can run a lot faster, and with better form and more fluid motion, when I stretch more often.

**Crosstraining** is another thing that can play a role in your running performance; it can help you build muscle, and increase your fitness overall.  Any form of aerobic exercise that has you using different muscles than running can be considered “crosstraining”, like cycling or swimming, or even walking.  Often times, training plans suggest you implement a day or so of crosstraining in your schedule, and they usually say that “continuous” exercises (like swimming) are best and put you at less risk for injury than “stopping-and-starting” exercises (like tennis or basketball, where you have to suddenly stop, or change direction).  I’m a huge fan of swimming

This brings us to you guys and our **questions for the day**:

* Do you stretch?  When and how??
* Do you crosstrain?  Or is running your crosstraining for something else?
* If you do

Hope everyone is having an awesome first day of the new year!

For many of us, and then, interminable January. It can be easy to get discouraged waiting for the season to change, whether it be bitter cold, rainy, terribly hot. It seems to be a month of ennui the later you get into it, especially coming on the heels of a busy holiday season.

Keep up with your routines - regular exercise, to fend off the blahs. Is there an event you'll be looking forward to at the end of next month? Maybe there should be a new holiday specific for people who start exercise and health improvements at the beginning of the year: January 23rd, Resolution Habit Day. I'd celebrate it!

Tell us how you get yourself out of the blahs. Build some support structures now so that you have something to rely on if your resolve begins to flag. Listen to your body

Earlier this week, exercise, different groups within the community you can participate in, and how the Sprints function within each round. Today, let's discuss **motivation**.

Your Why: What has motivated you to get to where you are now in your food, an injury, a wake-up call? Did you feel it was just time, or did you come here from another subreddit after seeing an advertising thread?

Meeting the Pitfalls: If you're not making progress, it can be hard to be motivated to keep going. Especially during what is for many folks a holiday season - it's so easy to indulge in all the food and get caught up in planning and attending parties, working retail overtime, facing finals. I love that there has been so much participation this week, but we know that participation usually flags as the rounds progress. Keep going strong, if you can; we won't judge you if you have to drop out for a while. We'll be here to support you.

Weekend: The weekend, like go for a longer run, get in two workouts at the gym, sleep in and restore our energy, make a home-cooked meal instead of eating fast food or an armful of snacks. Are these in your plans? Are you just going to keep on keeping on?

Finally, if you care to share. The more you think about it, the better you understand yourself and why you're doing what you're doing. We hope that enables you to continue doing it. Best of luck for the rest of your day!

[Yesterday](http://redd.it/148qwe) we discussed diet

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now
Our [Weekly Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/146k6h/weekly_challenge_week_1_dec_37_2012/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up

* Cardio is great

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K)

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play tennis.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/)

* If you haven't done so already

1345030882.0,y99he,[Weightlifting] Week 1 - Getting Started!,nymeatball,13,2,70,"Good morning everyone and welcome to our very first **Weightlifting** post. This is the first in a series of weekly posts where myself and **nanochic** will walk you through various weightlifting topics and discussions. The idea is that there will be a weekly topic/guiding question

Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy. There are fantastic benefits for both genders to be had from weightlifting, and where specific, we'll try to add in gender-specific topics when possible!

In addition to discussion topics, so let's get on with it!

--------

**Weekly Discussion Topic: Starter Programs**

Since it is our first week, or has never followed a program before - the hardest part is often knowing where to start. Thankfully, there are a *ton* of great resources right here on Reddit, and across the web, to help you get started. We'll be talking about three programs in particular today. Before we get into that, some quick terminology. If something doesn't make sense here - let us know and we'll get it added.

* Repetition: A single complete movement of an exercise. Abbreviated as 'reps'. If you lift a barbell off the floor
* Set: A 'set' of repetitions, without pausing in between for a significant period of time, you've done 1 set (of 5 reps)
* 3x5: This is short hand for abbreviating sets X reps. You can imagine how exhausting it would get saying ""3 sets of five"" over and over
* 1RM: Short for '1 rep max'. This is the most weight you can lift for 1 rep in any activity. 
* #RM: You'll see people talk about 3RMs, my 3RM for bench is 200 lbs"" that means they can do a set of 3 repetitions with 200lbs for the bench.
* PB/PR: Personal Best / Personal Record. Used to identify new records. (""I just set a new squat PB today by 10 lbs!"")
* BW: Bodyweight. Commonly paired with numbers to indicate strength in a lift. Saying you have a 1.5xBW squat means you can squat 1.5 times your body weight.
* These can get ridiculous


***Starting Strength (aka SS)***

One of the more popular programs amongst /r/fitness and /r/weightroom, the book is *fantastic* for any new lifter, and can be purchased either in a hard copy or e-book version.

There is a strong focus on form (the program has people starting with just the bar to get form down first). There's also some variation available with the program

Program Basics:

* 3x/week program. Week 1: ABA
* Day ""A"": Squats
* Day ""B"": Squats
* Focuses on RAPID progression. Most lifts you will do 3 sets of 5 reps. You still start your first workout with a weight that is ""moderately challenging"" to you

Resources:

* [Starting Strength Wiki](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:Introduction)
* [Buy the book on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738/ref=dp_ob_title_bk/189-7571169-3184244)

Bottom Line:

* Great, full body exercises.
* Lots of little details go into making this program


***Stronglifts (aka SL 5x5)***

Along with SS, and many on SL 5x5 still pick up the SS book for a reference.

The big differences between this program and SS, it's mostly the same.

Program Basics:

* 3x5/week program. Week 1: ABA
* Day ""A"": Squats
* Day ""B"": Squats

Resources:

* [Stronglifts Overview](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/)

Bottom Line:

* Another solid starter program
* 5x5 is great to start, to switch to a 3x5 scheme when the weights get heavier.


***New Rules of Lifting for Women (aka NRLFW)***

This is a comprehensive diet and exercise guide geared towards helping women find their way through the weight room

Program Basics:

* NRLFW consists of seven stages. Each stages has alternating days
* Some of the stages has two exercises that alternate sets.
* Starts off with higher reps

Resources:

* [New Rules of Lifting for Women](http://www.thenewrulesoflifting.com/nrol-for-women)

Bottom Line:

* Good starter program for women who might be hesitant to start lifting weights.
* Decent diet program. May have to adjust calories.
* Can take a while in the gym


----------------------

**Weekly Challenge**

This week's challenge we're starting out simple:

* **If you're already on a lifting routine**, and what your plans are for your next program.
* **If you're not yet on a lifting routine**, check out [this link](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#StarterPrograms). Your challenge for this week is to find a solid routine to stick to for this first Sprint!

**Round 7 Results**

- Drink 2 bottles of water every (work)day

No problem here. Work days are my cleanest eating and drinking days. If it only were workdays I would be super strict.

- No more skipping Saturday workout 

Can't imagine me skipping even one this round.

- Not overdoing shit

Was a problem last round. I did too much and felt exhausted so I skipped the Challenges this time. Worked well.

- No overeating

The first month was a problem but I got my shit figured out later

- Getting more social

Not really. Some problems at home with my soon conceiving wife. It is a stressful time. Really have to focus more on getting out. Well when we figured out childcare with the next kid.

- Keto

I wish.....I failed so often. I have this sugar cravings sometimes. Right now in the break time it is even worse. Have to work on that one.

- Daily Scale

Hopped on the scale daily and it really helped.

- 90dg Activity

More or less. Next round probably not so much

- Month 1 Goal: 81 kg | Month 2 Goal: 80 kg | Month 3 Goal: 79 kg

Really sucked during M1. M2 was better and during M3 I caught my goal. I did it.....yeah.

- Progress Pics

That one helped me stay motivated. And I really do not like photos. I did some before starting round 1 ([here](http://i.imgur.com/YQcow.jpg) and [here](http://imgur.com/xqpSk)). After different rounds the progress pics still looked as if I have achieved nothing, [from the side](http://i.imgur.com/z3Dtm.jpg) and [front](http://i.imgur.com/dBFFo.jpg).

I still have a bit of a flabby stomach that I am kind of self conscious about (same as with weight)

**Round 8 Goals**

Thus my plans for the next round to gain a bit of muscle mass. How will I go about this. Here is something found via the fittit faq:

&gt;    If you are an athlete or highly active person currently attempting to lose body fat while preserving lean muscle mass

&gt;    If you are an athlete or highly active person

&gt;    If you are sedentary and not looking to change body composition much

Being a vegetarian is tough. Having the added stress of a baby will add some stress. And even though I am in charge of cooking soon, especially for the bench press stagnated. So I hope I can set some more PRs this time and have more workout (instead of weight loss) success. The big variable is kid #2, so if I would just be able to do my routine, it would almost be fine.

See you next round.

Today's topic is: **Diets**.  &amp;I am stealing from #4's intro post:

We have people following all kinds of diets here

* Don't diet

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over

* Don't deprive yourself

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I know first hand how difficult it is to transition into healthy eating habits.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  I know that eating can cause anxiety and stress--especially when doing something new.  I urge to stray away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind

Personally

Now...!  Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

I also wanted to encourage our members to take part in a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/exerciseprofile) by two graduate psychology students from University of Montreal and University of Quebec in Trois-Rivieres (one of whom has been an active 90er for the past two rounds).  This is an amazing research study about documenting the relationship between past exercise experience, planning and the adoption of a regular physical activity habit.  Check it out!

1334292371.0,s7hef,[Progress] Amazing when you find something that works.,fxpstclvrst,12,0,10,"I just completed my second round here and am excited about starting the third.

During round one, exercising and stretching as per my doctors' instructions. That lasted into round two, where those activities tapered off and my GP and I agreed that my shoulder was back to mostly normal function. I didn't really lose much weight, despite mostly trying to keep my calories down.

A month into this past round, I completely revamped my diet. And my new eating habits gave me ridiculous success. So much success, in fact, that I felt so foolish for the way I'd been eating for so much of the past.

I was a vegetarian for 8 years, I couldn't escape the 195-200 range. I had fought my way down to 189 but was always bobbing up back over the 190 divide when I talked to my doctor.

My doctor advised me that a.) I'm only 5'3"" (I've shrunk an inch since I was a teenager) and b.) I needed to get down to 163 in order to really make a dent in my overweight status

###

Starting weight

BMI: 33.8

Ending weight

BMI: 31.4

###

My goals for next round: start exercising again and achieve my 163 weight. Also

Method: sitting at my computer every night playing video games

Typical meals in a typical day:

 * Breakfast: tuna

 * Lunch: 10 raw baby carrots, 1 serving deli meat

 * Snack: 1/4 cup mixture of sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds

 * Dinner: Eggs, turkey, pork roast, or other meats, accompanied by steamed broccoli, carrots, or other veggies

 * During vacation/from fast food places: grilled chicken salads without dressing and usually without cheese

Obstacles this round and last: none for eating, the latest MMO in which you get a Wookie and a baby Tauntaun and fly across the galaxy in your own Corellian freighter.

[Yesterday](http://redd.it/oatkk) we discussed diet

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now
Our [Daily Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/obtba/daily_challenge_wednesday_january_11_2012/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up

* Cardio is great

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K)

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/)

* If you haven't done so already

some time to write this up here. Man even though I said goal in the title, not gonna stop anytime soon, so my goal is  to stay more on focus and not be that sloppy.

And I was sloppy that round. I gained a bit (although might be a bit muscle here and there) and we do not have to talk about the stuff I eat....no no no no no. Besides that it was mostly a success. I injured my leg so I couldn't do that much

I couldn't do stuff like squats, too. With the endurance stuff, now to be honest, I didn't really focus on that so there was no progress at all. I still can do 100 crunches or 40 bench dips, but push-ups kind of declined from 50 to 40, but again, I wasn't actually trying to improve here. What I did improve was the weight for 8 repetitions and that worked actually pretty well:

Bench Press x8: 54kg -&gt; 63kg

Chin-Ups / Pull-Ups: 8reps -&gt; 10reps

Dips (Triceps version) 8x: 29kg

Barbell Shoulder Press x2: 44kg -&gt; x8: 44kg

Pendlay Rows x8: 54kg -&gt; 60kg

Not bad at all. I got me the barbell bench press achievement on fitocracy and due to better equipment now (thanks santa) I am sure the dumbbell bench press achievement will follow very soon.

Other achievements: I stopped biting nails and I impregnated my wife.

So for the future I hope to heal properly and eat more consistently. Also,,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,True

Life is a fickle mistress. Life should always come first but when it comes to dieting this is not a good thing. We celebrated last night with some steaks and sweet potatoes and a bottle of wine. I think it was a pretty healthy alternative to going out getting wasted or pigging out at some greasy joint. The most aggravating parts about this is how unexpected it was. 

How do you handle unexpected plans that fight with your diet? Do you roll with the punches and enjoy yourself? Do you portion control and eat only what you need? Do you find alternatives or maybe eat before hand? We all have to deal with these kind of situations from time to time and its fun to see how everyone handles it differently. 

What else are we up to today in the name of fitness? What is our goal today? I am going climbing tonight and going to be super light on my elbow. I am going to work on technique on very easy problems to see how much weight I can take off my arm. It will be good light exercise and working on technique is always important.

So

Personally, as I am still hurt it was my ""cardio replacement day"" where I usually do bodyweight exercises (squats, calves raises) and such. Nothing really spectacular, probably just to have the thought to do something. Not doing squats might even help recovery. On the other hand as usual when I spend my day mostly sitting, I really felt stiff this morning.

There are certainly exceptions

When I make a decision to lose weight, have no stamina, and little to show in the way of results.  I then get frustrated at myself for having invested so much mentally, emotionally, and monetarily.  I look around, and the fitness community is filled with mostly beautiful people that can do in their sleep what burns me out.  I feel pathetic.  I feel like the outsider that maybe drove me to being overweight in the first place.

If this isn't you, because in a way, I'm considering losing my identity and that is scary.

What I need to remember is that this isn't a sprint.  I will see progress.  It is probably a waste of my money to join a gym when I can work at home on doing a few situps or pushups.  Simply walking up the stairs, before I know it, I'll be doing bigger things.  Maybe then I'll need a gym membership.

I’m designing the weekly challenges to be things that will help us all stick with our diets and will make it easier to meet our goals.  Each week will have a theme (more on that later.)     

Weight loss, plateaus, ‘cheating’, etc.) you find something positive to say as well.  I think it helps keep us all from getting too down on ourselves when things get tough.

**THIS WEEK’S CHALLENGES: MAKING IT EASIER TO STICK WITH THE DIET**     
Pick *one* based on your situation.     

**If you share a pantry/fridge with non-dieters:**     
* Color code the food. Buy colored masking tape or stickers (red and green
* Reorganize the pantry/kitchen so that all the items that are acceptable on your diet are in a specific area of the fridge or pantry (or preferably in a different cupboard entirely).       

**If you eat out a lot:**     
* Make a menu cheat sheet. Make a list of all the places in the area you like to eat out.  Look at their menus online and make a list of all the dishes you can eat there.  Keep this list in your wallet (and post it here to help others!)  Let us know if you get stumped by certain places (i.e. Chinese food

**If you are overwhelmed by shopping/reading nutrition labels:**     
* Make a complete shopping list before you go to the store.  Use a website like Peapod.com (or the equivalent online grocery shopping website in your area) to check all the nutrition labels &amp; ingredients at home before you even put the item in your cart … that way you don’t need to spend hours at the store wandering around reading nutrition labels and getting frustrated.  Post your shopping list here to help  others!     

**If you never have time to cook or prepare meals:**     
* Spend one night this week preparing food in advance. Pick a meal that you could see yourself eating a lot (favorite meat, if you don’t cook at all, just separating pre-cooked food into individual sized portions.)  Put in individual tupperwares and freeze so you’ll have them on hand in a pinch.  Most cooked keto and paleo food reheats very well.       

**If you’re a ‘snacker’:**     
* Buy or make at least 6 different types of quick snacks to have on hand. At least 3 of them should be shelf-stable (i.e. does not need to be refrigerated.)  One of them should be ‘sweet’ (cinnamon or cocoa roasted almonds

**The end of 3**

I have been silent for the last couple of weeks and wanted to give a short summary on what was going on. The last week of work before my holidays was really horrible. There is this customer and this huge project no one seems to completely understand it, manipulation of live systems, many customer modifications that had to be done on the fly and couldn't be tested, problems with different versions and so on and on. Given the fact that it was our biggest customer and that shit had to be done for 2 factories, I was really worried. I got it running at 18.30 (hooray for 10+h days) shortly before our network went down and before I could book my time / clean up some mess. So my first free day started with driving to work again and cleaning up that mess which luckily took me only 2 hours or so.

I felt kind of relieved (no angry calls in the morning) and had my holidays. From the workout perspective it wasn't bad, well it are tough times for Vegetarians who want to do low carb atm. Try eating out everyday and you probably know what I mean, even worse, because of an EHEC infection going on here (I believe more than 1k infected, at least 10 already dead) it is not suggested to eat fresh vegetables at all, so no salad for me. All in all, nutrition wasn't that bad, ooh the booze. I was drinking at the beach, so this is not the end of the world to me). Beside all that it was a nice holiday. We went to a theme park with Laura (twice) and she had a blast, slowly trying to get some stuff done (like taxes) and getting back on track training and nutrition wise.

**Results #3**

Well

- I can now do 8 chin-ups in a row (5 pull-ups)

- 8 Push-ups with an additional 32kg (70.5lbs) weight

- Running the 5ks in less than 30 minutes

- Some visible ab muscles (the ones underneath the rib cage) still flabby stomach though

Looking back at where I started this is pretty amazing. I dug up some old photos. [This](http://imgur.com/wCLvp) is from Autumn 2008. I hit my highest weight after New Year's Eve of the same year at 115 kilos (I was obese back then). Lost some weight during 2009

**Goals for #4**

My goals are pretty unspectacular so no change compared with #3

- Keep up with my training plan (2 running days

- Keep up with doing low carb

- Stricter with booze

- I wanted to start a running group

and hopefully by round 4 I will see less flabby midsection.

1299536100.0,fzbdq,[FOOD] My list of staples.,Serasha,12,0,9,"Hi everyone!

I was hoping that by posting a list of the things I like to keep on hand to enhance and help me maintain my healthy eating

Things that are low in calories and high in flavor:

* Mezzetta sliced hot pepper rings. Great on salads

* Dill pickles! I eat them whole as snacks

* Light balsamic vinaigrette. I love this on salads

* Vanilla soy protein powder. I put a few tablespoons into my oatmeal or fruit smoothies to boost the protein in the meal. It also adds nice flavor and since I don't sweeten my oatmeal or smoothies, 7g protein.

Things that are great for substitutions:

* Greek 0% yogurt. I mix in a packet of dry ranch dressing mix with this to make nonfat

* La Tortilla Factory Smart and Delicious Low Carb Wraps. I get the tomato basil. I use these for breakfast burritos, or just as a bread on the side. They are filling, have fewer carbs than most bread, and have a good amount of protein and an amazing amount of fiber. 1 Large (10"") wrap = 100 calories, 20g carbs, 3g fat, 9g protein

* Thomas bagel thins

Items that are great for snacking:

* Mini Babybel Original Cheese Rounds. These little 1oz cheeses pack a huge amount of flavor and help satisfy my cheese craving with very little damage. 1 round = 60 calories

* Small, and very satisfying. 1 clementine = 40 calories.

* Sugar-free Jello pudding snacks and Cool Whip Fat Free. These two are great individually

That's all I've got for now. I hope some of you can find some inspiration in these items. Remember,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,silver3,t3_fzbdq

For many, I often allow myself to be ruled by mathematics, numbers, and what have you. For others, it is all about the amount of crunches done, or the amount of weight lifted.  

But I read this, or for skipping the gym, or that you are not doing enough, or when you look around you and see that everyone is doing so much more than you are, just read this.  

Have a great day !  

**From Brain Over Brawn

&gt;You are not bound by numbers
there for one thing: to help you determine that you’re being honest with yourself.
Strict counting helps you avoid the slippery slope of one missed exercise or blown out meal leading to the next. Many people have an all-or-nothing mentality and may likewise quit because of some small setback. All too often, and thereby more attainable.  

&gt;The point is this: no individual unit, calorie, or gram is or can
be the deal-breaker. But without one, or more. The
fact each of them counts so little is why each of them counts so much. What you really want is consistency. It’s not the one exercise or meal that provides success

1289920493.0,e6zf6,[90dg] DAY 2 - What should I eat?,katiekatums,13,2,14,"If you’re already following a diet plan or you’re familiar with tracking calories

**knioette’s awesome advice on dieting:**

You’re not expected to suddenly become uber healthy in one day. What's one of your vices? Pop? McDonald's? Waking up late? Not making breakfast? Not brushing your teeth before bed? Just pick *one* thing and start fixing it gradually! Once you you know you can stick to the new good habit

If you eat McD's 20 times a week, because even if you manage to stick to it all the way through (which is unlikely, because diets suck), you'll most likely revert back to the unhealthy lifestyle eventually. To make it work, take it slow and steady, and simply work on a building new, healthier lifestyle. Weight loss will be a side effect of embracing a healthier lifestyle.

Don't let yourself go hungry! Measure your portions and eat enough to feel satiated, you’re full. The stomach, in its relaxed, near-empty form, can hold about 45ml (~1/5 cup). However, it can expand to hold 1L of food, or if you push it to the limits, which is why you should stop when satiated. If you wait for 15-20 more mins, then resume. Don’t resume. When you pause

**Figuring out a diet that will work for you**

So how should you structure your diet then? The following tips are from Tom Venuto’s [BFFM](http://www.burnthefat.com/), and me. (Again, I recommend that you buy BFFM or check it out from the library and read through it this 90 days. Venuto’s writing is much nicer than mine and he gives much more complete and convincing arguments for each point.)

* Don’t “diet”, so start by trimming back the things that you know are unhealthy for you. Also, try to add in fruits and veggies wherever possible. If you’re not a fan of veggies, take a walk through the vegetable aisles, and pick some random, weird looking vegetables and then google recipes involving them. Be adventurous. ;)

* **Keep your muscle mass**, rather than loose and mushy. Add strength training to cardio to maintain or increase your LBM while you’re losing fat. You can figure out what your lean body mass is by figuring out your body fat percentage, then subtracting the pounds of fat from your total weight. As an example, if 90dger A is 120 lbs, with 25% body fat, then she has 120 - (25% x 120) = 90 lbs LBM. If she loses 20 lbs, but her bf% stays at 25%, BUT her lean body mass also dropped to 75lbs! If you have two people at the same height and weight, aim for slow weight loss and eat lots of protein. Try to get 0.5-1.0 g of protein per day per pound of lean body mass; and make up the rest of your Calories with (good) fats and carbs.

* Figure out your Calorie requirements to hit your target weight loss rate, subtract 15-20% to create find Calorie target to reach 1-2 lbs of weight loss per week. For example, if 90dger B is 30 years old, 6’0” tall, and weighs 250 lbs, his BMR is 2334 Calories. If he’s sedentary, then his maintenance level is 2800 Calories. If he wants to lose 1-2 lbs per week, then suddenly cut back to 1800

* Don’t just diet, you’re losing lean body mass in addition to body fat. If you exercise in addition to dieting, you force your body to burn mostly fat, while it tries to build muscle mass for your exercises. Cardio is very good for cardiovascular health, in addition to its extra Calorie burning capability. Weight lifting and resistance training are very good for making muscle.. and guess what? The more muscles you have on your body, the more Calories you burn throughout the day - muscle burns Calories, fat does not. Ladies, if you’re lifting weight, don’t fear yoga. You sure as hell won’t get as little as women. Besides

* Don’t aim for “as low as possible.” Try to **actually hit your Calorie goal**. If you drop your Calories too low (more than about a 1000 Cals below maintenance), and feel sluggish and awful. Also, listen to your body. It’s not unlikely that your actual BMR is higher or lower than the calculated value. When you make any changes, pay attention to how your body responds.

* **Eat frequently and don’t skip meals.** This one is more for comfort. If you let yourself get very hungry before each  meal, as long as you don’t exceed your daily caloric intake. Small snacks throughout the day help you stay in control when you sit down to eat. If you tend to be hungry after dinner, *plan ahead*. The reason night snacking is usually a bad idea is that most people have already reached their Calorie goals by dinner. If you know that you like a snack most evenings, then make sure to leave room for it in your Calorie budget so that you’re still within your goals.

* If you’ve hit a plateau

* Lose weight **slowly and steadily** to decrease the risk of gaining it back. It took a long time to put the weight on, I hope that you’ll stick around with us for Round 3.

**So what should I do today?**

I recommend that you sign up for an account on Livestrong and track everything you eat for a week before you start changing your habits. Make sure to set your calorie goals there, feel free to post about it in the YDG posts!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,True,self1,

Training plans are also nice because they tell you what to do - it’s easy to roll out of bed

However

There are **lots** of training plans available out on the ‘Net -- everything from C25K (and its many variants like Zombie 5k) to ultra marathon guides.  When you look at a training plan, and make sure it aligns with your goals.  If your goal is to complete a 10k run, you probably don’t want to be looking at a plan that focuses on speed work.  

And most importantly, and nothing over 4 miles during the weekdays, because I do most of my running during lunch hour at work.  The best plan in the world is no good to you if you’re not going to be able to make it work for you!

First, Sprint 3"" thrown about.  We touched upon these in our advertising in other subreddits, but I'll briefly describe them again here for anyone who didn't see anything.

**What are Sprints?**

Don't worry, each 30 days long with a 5 day break in-between.  This allows you guys to be able to really focus and go all out for 30 days and then take a short break in order to mentally and physically recover and recharge.

I also want to talk to you guys about **progress pictures**.

Some of you have already taken some pictures but if you haven't already

You might not want to take pictures because they're a painful reminder of where you are right now.  Take them anyway.  In a month, you will have made a ton of progress but you just can see it because you've seen yourself in a mirror hundreds of times since you started.  Pictures are a great way to show ""hey, what I'm doing is actually working"" even when the scale doesn't budge or measurements go wonky (water weight is a fickle mistress).  Trust me, you might not be happy taking the pictures right now but they will be invaluable in the near future.

I think running is unique as a sport/exercise activity because it requires more mental toughness than other sports.  You can be as fit as you want, and I'd also like to hear your thoughts about this topic or share any additional tips you have!

* **Always decide on your distance before you start** - Don't let tired/sore you decide how long you will go in the middle of your run.  Because you will take the easy way out, I have a counterargument for myself.

* **If you want to run farther, and then convince yourself that ""it's only a mile farther""

* **If you want to run faster, and I couldn't figure out why.  I could run ok in races and stuff, but not in my training runs.  Then, I decided to start paying more attention to my GPS watch pace.  And immediately cut 1.5-2 min/mile off my times (from 11:30 min/miles to 9:30-10 min/miles).  The difference is that when I didn't pay attention to the watch I was sure that I was running as fast as I could.  But when I'd look at the watch and say to myself ""I'd really like to be running faster"" I could speed up and realize that I was lying to myself when I thought I was running as fast as I could.  The watch helps keep you accountable to yourself.

* **Distract yourself or give yourself pep talks while running** - This may sound silly, having conversations or writing emails to people, planning out my running week or just my schedule for the week, etc.  Running is tough.  So you have to be tougher.  If you're constantly telling yourself that you're tired and need to stop and can't run anymore, you'll probably be right.  But if you've decided on your distance ahead of time and know you can run, don't talk yourself out of it.

Finally past my belt test last night after 4 weeks of waiting and mixed schedules. So now I am a brown belt in Taekwondo. 9 months to train for my black belt. 

It brought up a good point though with all of that waiting I kept changing things to make sure I felt the best for the test. I did it for a few weeks and I managed to not be as ready as I would have liked for the test. Funny even with my good intentions I should have just trained like normal and just taken one rest day each time. 

So my question for today is do you do anything special to prepare or an activity? Does it change your training at all? Is there anything you are planning on doing that maybe you could prepare for a bit?

Otherwise how is your day? Doing anything fun in the name of fitness? Let us know! Also

This week, [social situations](http://redd.it/1c57dn), and [rewards](http://redd.it/1c7a8z). Today, let's talk about **getting back on/staying on track**.

Let's face it - we're hitting the end of our third week, are you finding yourself playing catch-up, or are you letting your resolve slip?

* *If you're not doing so hot*, or is it nonexistent?

* *If your resolve is as strong as ever*

If you're feeling lost, write it on the back of your hand, but remember why you started this journey and make that new commitment. Make one positive choice today, another on Sunday, and check in on Monday whether your weekly results are acceptable to you or disappointing to you. Reach out to the community here, and we'll support you and do as much as we can to help you effectively change your life. You're the only one who can act on your choices, but we all believe in our individual power over our own destinies. Each of us has our own journey and success story that we made ourselves. We can all do this.

Those who are on track - great job! Affirm your positive choices and any positive results

Every one of us is amazing. Remember that!

Good morning, and everyone needs a break every now and then.

How do you disconnect? Is your diet and exercise routine something that you  need to take a break from every few weeks? Or do you use your weekly long run

Personally I've found that aside from physical health - the biggest benefit of exercise is that mental and emotional release. Pretty much the moment I pick up a weight or lace up my running shoes, everyone needs a break from spreadsheets for a day or two. I find myself getting disengaged once or twice every round, and then coming back more energized after a couple day 'break'.

Better to slow down a bit than burn out entirely - that's how it works for me. What about you? Have a great day today!

1365506379.0,1bzeb2,[Runners] - Week 3 - Shoes!,dinosaurdinosrawr,11,0,39,"Good morning

This week’s topic is something that is plays an ENORMOUS role in running

First, meaning that your heel is the first part of your foot to hit the ground and then roll towards the ball of your foot.  This is similar to how you walk - try taking a few steps and think about how your foot “rolls” from heel to toe, and that’s similar to how your foot hits the ground while running.  Another type of foot strike that some runners use is a *mid-foot strike*, where that initial pressure as you strike the ground is in the middle area of the foot.  There is a third type of foot strike, most often found in barefoot or minimalist running, is a *forefoot strike*, meaning that the ball of the foot is what hits the ground first.  This type of running also often applies to sprinters - next time you sprint, a mid-foot strike is also fairly common.  

Now that we’ve talked about foot strike, their foot will initially strike on the outer side of the heel and roll towards the center of the body in order to distribute the weight evenly, and their knees usually stay in line over the big toe; this is natural and ideal.  For someone with *overpronation*, their foot will also initially strike on the lateral side of the heel, but as it rolls toward the center of the body it will roll too far and the weight will be distributed unevenly, and the knee will often track inward; overpronation causes shock to not be absorbed as well, and can result in problems with collapsing arches or ankles rolling inwards.  For someone with *underpronation*, though the foot won’t roll far enough

So, shoes are often designed with these things in mind!  A lot of running shoes have cushioning or padding, especially in the heel (as opposed to the forefront) since that tends to be the area of the foot that pounds on the ground and have the most pressure on it.  *Minimalist shoes*, however, don’t have particularly much padding and are designed to be fairly close to being barefoot, but with protection for your feet from whatever you may encounter on your run.  For neutral runners, they usually just use *neutral shoes* with regular padding, as well as neutral runners

How do you know what type of shoe is best for you?  I would suggest going to a running store and getting fitted - after being properly fitted at a specialty store, I love them so much that when I got new running shoes I wound up sticking with the same ones, and just upgraded to the new version :D

Now on to the **questions for this week**:

* How did you pick your shoes?  Were you fitted or did you chose them on your own?  How do you like them?
* Do you know what type you need, or neutral pronator?
* Have you tried barefoot or minimalist running?  What was your experience with that?
* How often do you get a new pair of shoes?  Was it a difficult transition
* Any other shoe-related comments?

Apologies for the long post

Earlier this week, talked about the [groups](http://redd.it/1b68nr) within 90daysgoal, and brought up [weekends](http://redd.it/1b8qrl). Today, let's talk about **motivation**.

What's your motivation for changing your life? Are you concerned for your health? Do you want to improve the way you look? Are you training for a specific or aspirational event? Are you seeking to improve personal records in weightlifting or swimming?

What are ways you've been able to successfully motivate yourself? Are there things you've tried to use as motivation that haven't worked out so well (such as a smaller pair of jeans that sat untouched in the closet for 3 years)?

Do you find that group encouragement works

I hope you are all aiming to stay healthy, one mind, and one life, but we also get ceaseless opportunities to choose our destinies. I hope you find reason enough to continue to pursue health and happiness in whatever way you see fit.

We all know that diet is crucial when it comes to losing weight and that we need to “eat healthy”

* Don’t shop when hungry if possible.  If you’re starving when you go
* Make a list and stick to it.  If you have a pre-set list of what you need to buy, so I wound up eating just vegetables for dinner for three days and then ordering crappy take-out until I could get back there).
* Stick to the outside of the store - the outer perimeter usually has the freshest and healthiest ingredients... meat, you can always try frozen vegetables (but double check for any sauces that are added to the bag, because that can easily change the nutritional value of the veggies!)
* Check what’s on sale and in season before going - those will be cheaper
* Planning meals in advance also helps with the grocery list - if you have set meals ahead of time then you know what you need!
* When buying an item off of the inner shelves, checking the label may help you decide.
* Also check the label for portion size - for example, you might be missing some information about how “healthy” it really is - it’s important to think about how much of it you are realistically going to use at a time.

Now that you’ve read the tips, and maybe we can help each other out :D

Going along with this Monday’s topic of body image, what is something that *makes* you happy with your body every now and then?  Maybe you feel super confident with your body when you wear a certain outfit, or maybe you feel confident and happy with yourself when you hit that certain distance/reps/etc. at the gym, or maybe you’re starting to notice certain features more as you make progress.  Regardless of what it is, let’s share **what makes us feel confident and happy with ourselves**.

I’ve found that I’m the most confident in my body after a long run - for me, *my* body was capable of that feat”.  That usually ends up carrying over into how I feel about my body once I’m showered and dressed for the rest of my day, and it feels *good* to finally reach a point where I’m happy with myself.  Now, I’ll be honest that I still have a ton of days (multiple times per day, even) where I feel exactly the opposite, but I just keep reminding myself that **years of not liking the way I look won’t be reversed in a day, so I’m grateful for those moments where I feel confident**.

Nox's skiing adventure made me think of a topic for today's post - **trying new/uncommon ways to exercise**.  Skiing is something that a lot of people don't get to do often, or climbing, or snowboarding... for me, it's boxing/kickboxing - I love it and find bag training and doing drills with partners to be an excellent workout, but my student budget just doesn't allow me to go all that often.

Hey, it's a day when we all reflect on whether small mammals can really predict the weather, watch a Bill Murray movie, and participate in the Pennsylvania Polka.

Do you often feel like you're going through the motions and not going anywhere? Do your goals sometimes put you into existential crisis because you feel as though you're not making any progress?

How is your progress going so far this round - are you ahead of where you thought you'd be, what do you think could pull you out of your rut - lapsing less, different exercise, different diet, more time to put toward your goal achievement?

Have a great rest of your Saturday.

Last week we talked about what is in our gym bags.  Today

What's your go-to brand?  What's your favorite pair of pants, shoes, etc?  Do you tie/hold your hair back with anything?  Do you wear different things to different types of workouts, i.e. yoga versus weight lifting versus cardio?  Where have you found the best deal for workout clothes?  Is it cheap year-round (like Old Navy or Target) or are there sales to watch for (like Lululemon or Nike)?

I hope everyone's keeping up the pace and doing well!

Let's talk about exercise

##Those of you under 35 - *how are you planning on staying fit as you get older*?  

##Those of you that are 35+ - *what are you currently doing to stay fit and are you succeeding*?

A personal story - I was not the most athletic kid when I was young.  I had exercise-induced asthma, so that was a bad combination.  It wasn't until I turned 16 that I discovered girls and decided to get into shape.  I was in pretty good shape until I started grad school and working full-time, when I became skinny-fat.  

Fast forward to age 35 and I'm ""suddenly"" fat-fat, and within a year I was in decent shape and down 25 lbs.  It was *hard*, and I now know that it would have been a hell of a lot easier to have stayed in shape the entire time.  *Much* easier.

Now that I'm closing in on 50, it's **DON'T GET ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING A FAST METABOLISM**! :-)

Anyway

Have fun!

Now that we've got nearly a week under our belts, I'm going to explain the **sprints** you've heard about.

A couple of rounds ago, so we split the entire round into 3 sprints.  Each sprint is 30 days long and has a 5 day rest-period in-between.  That rest period can be used as a break or you can keep on doing what you're doing.

Sprint 1

One way you can utilize these sprints is to set smaller goals.  Some of you may have set weekly goals (or even daily ones) as well as overarching 90 day ones

Now that we've got a few days out of the way and we're slowly figuring out what we want to do

What motivates you?  What's motivating you to undertake this journey?  Do you get motivated by pictures, or quotes?  Perhaps multiple things motivate you.

One of the best ways to stick to your goals is to find motivation.  Are you doing this for yourself or others?  What life-long dream is pushing you to continue?  Is it going rock climbing or being able to run a half or full marathon (or even a 5K)?  Once you figure out what motivates you, why you are doing what you are doing.

Welcome back for Round 9, the format is almost identical - there's a new competition this time around for **Heaviest Barbell Squat**.

------------------------------

**Q. What is Fitocracy?**

A. Fitocracy is a social site where you sign up and track your workouts. You 'level up' by completing workouts, perform a bench press) to the ridiculous (Squat twice your bodyweight for 20 reps, Run a 4 minute mile). 

**Q. Ok

A. Groups/Challenges are a way to get people together with similar interests, and ranks you against other group members. You're still allowed to log whatever you want daily, but only running will count.

**Q. You've got me excited - now how do I *WIN*?**

A. The primary intent of these challenges is to encourage everyone to be more active, and running 10 miles will get you more points than running 5.

**Q. When does the first set of challenges start?**

A. Unlike past rounds where we delayed challenges a week, December 3rd. The first challenge ends on the last day of Sprint 1: Tuesday, January 1st.

We talked about this a bit over in Women Losing Weight, **social pressures** are particularly relevant with Labor Day this weekend.

How do you deal with sticking to your diet and exercise regime when surrounded by pressure to stray?  Do you work in a cheat meal (or three)?  Do you have the willpower to turn down foods and/or alcohol?  Do you have any tips you want to share with the rest of us who may need some help?

So far this week we've set goals, decided on our diet, started our fitness plans, and generally been completely awesome. Next week, it's time to get down to business and work towards those goals. How are you going to work out? How are you going to follow that diet? What about the week after that? **What's going to keep you motivated to keep going?**

I'm a very goal oriented person, I get so much motivation from all of you who are working towards the same goals I have. Seeing everyone discuss their routines and diets in the weekly threads makes me want to get out there and stick to mine. Peer pressure, if you will, but in a good way.

One other great form of motivation for me are the **Fitocracy Challenges** - I will be helping to run these this round

Now

Also

**What now?**

By now you've set your goals for the full 90 days, we decided in implement ""sprints.""

**What are sprints?**

Sprints are short segments within the full 90 days.  Each of them last for 30 days

**When are the sprints?**

* Sprint 1: Days 1-30 (Aug 13 - Sep 11)
* Recovery: 5 days (Sep 12 - Sep 16)
* Sprint 2: Days 31-60 (Sep 17 - Oct 16)
* Recovery: 5 days (Oct 17 - Oct 21)
* Sprint 3: Days 61-90 (Oct 22 - Nov 20)

This, conveniently, last as long as each of the sprints!  If you don't have a [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com/) account, it's easy to sign up.  If, for some reason, you can't get one, let a mod know and we can invite you.

Please give us feedback on everything!  We like to know what we're doing well and what we need to improve!

All of that being said, this will be a very challenging day with temptations and everything.  How do you plan on combating the weekend slump?

1343821478.0,xi2b2,[PROGRESS] Round 7 results,nymeatball,11,0,22,"Can't believe round 7 is over already! Looking forward to round 8 and a new set of challenges!

**Round 7 Recap**

TL;DR - Bulked for 80% of the round. Did mostly compound lifts (Squats, OHP)
on a linear program (3 sets X 5 reps). Started running last month of the round. Cut the last month of the round. Had middle of the road success across the board.


**Starting Stats**

* Weight: 167.8lbs
* BF%: ???
* Deadlift: 185 lbs / 84kg (5RM)
* Bench: 87 lbs / 40kg (5RM)
* Squat: 122 lbs / 55kg (5RM)
* OHP: 70 lbs / 32kg (5RM)
* Longest Run: n\a
* Best Mile Time: n\a

**Pre Round Goals**

My goals for R8 were

* Weight: 186 lbs / 84kg
* Deadlift: 305 lbs / 138kg (+120)
* Bench: 135 lbs / 61kg (+48)
* Squat: 235 lbs / 107kg (+113)
* OHP: 115 lbs / 52kg (+45)

**Weight Lifting**

I had a couple issues with this during the round. The first issue was that I set my goals way too high. Every time I got under the bar I thought, and sacrificed form for more weight. This, in all likelihood, led to issue #2.

My second issue was that I had a noticeable enough hip injury about 3 weeks into the round that it caused me to need to stop squats and deadlifts for a good 1 1/2 - 2 weeks. Nothing major - in the end I think it was a strained hip flexor or similar - but enough of a time off
to where I both A) wasn't progressing, this cost me a good 3-4 weeks of progress.

Thankfully

Towards the end of the round I was able to hit a bodyweight squat, and back to progressing linearly week to week on the other 3. Will definitely keep this going for the next round.

**Running**

Coinciding with the ""Squats, I can't run, and I do
believe that's 1/3rd of the race

At the end of the round I'm now done with the first 4 weeks of my running schedule. I'm doing a 3x/week MWF routine, so far I've been able to run several 5ks, a couple 5 mile runs, and most importantly, not injure myself yet. 

I will have some more quantifiable goals for the next round, I really don't care how slow or how little I run.

My very first run was in year old tennis shoes with an experienced runner, shortened my stride a whole bunch, and am able to run comfortably for anywhere from 3-5 miles or 30-60 minutes without stopping. Lessons learned here? ICE, ICE, ICE. I ice my legs whether they hurt or not on nights after I run. Running shoes make a *huge* difference. 

**End of Round Stats/Goal Tracking**

Numbers wise

* Weight: 184 lbs / 83kg (+16 lbs / 7kg) -- Goal reached!
* BF%: ??? -- Still not tracking this reliably at all...
* Deadlift: 213 lbs (+28lbs) -- Goal missed by 92 lbs
* Bench: 123 lbs (+36 lbs)  -- Goal missed by 12 lbs
* Squat: 188 lbs (+66 lbs) -- Goal missed by 47 lbs
* OHP: 88lbs (+18 lbs) -- Goal missed by 37 lbs
* Longest Run: 5.2 miles  / 8.4km
* Best Mile Time: 9:00

Initial goals might have been a touch high. Considering getting injured

**Final Thoughts**

* I write too much.
* Having to work your way back up from an injury is way more frustrating than progressing slowly.
* You *can* lift and run at the same time
sacrifice a little bit in either area. I chose to sacrifice a bit on squats.
* Ice is literally the best thing ever. 

I doubt anyone has questions

How did everyone do over the weekend?  Did you meet your goals?

The weekend was a wash for me.  It's...always kinda been a wash.  I've been with 90dg since Round I and one of my ongoing issues is trying to maintain my healthy outlook over the weekend.  It's hard.  It continues to be a challenge for me.  So yeah.

Let's talk **motivation**.  All of us here come from very different walks of life.  Each of us have our own reasons for being here.  What is your motivation?  What helps get you into your best mindset?

I'm just curious if this is something that happens to other people as well. Whenever I'm making a change in my diet/life style (which happens quite often as I always eventually go back to a ""normal"" more sedentary chocolate filled lifestyle) I get some really weird dreams. 

There are two types; in one I dream about my past as a dancer (I have a degree in contemporary ballet). I dream either that I am in really good shape again and that I'm flexible and strong and dancing, which felt like torture). When I just stopped dancing I had these dreams at random times, and quite often. Now I only get them when I start a good exercise regime and get a healthy diet...

The other kind of dream I get is that I cheat on my diet. And these dreams are sooooo realistic. I'll dream that I eat cakes and chocolate or something, not licking or nibbling or anything, just eating it as if it was a hamburger.. 

It's just really weird

Do any of you have dreams similar to mine?

[Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com) is a popular workout tracker that turns exercise into a game. As you log your routines, earn achievements, and level up. More importantly for us, it offers groups and challenge which really help to keep the motivation going.

Speaking of the challenges, we will have different challenges next sprint and might even play around with sub-groups (a free 4 all challenge for beginner or a Bench Press challenge for women come to mind), but this all depends on the participation and interest here. So for this round we offer the following challenges (please note that you can follow the links only if you were invited to the group, but we will get there in a second):

We voted on that one and it was decided that this round the challenges stay private, which means a little bit more work for you, but I am sure it just requires a few minutes of your time to join. What now follows is a detailed description of steps necessary for you to join the challenges:

Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a

I wasn't expecting much. However

Final stats put me around 6'5"" tall (195cm) and 177 pounds (80.5KG). A BMI of 21 from 22.5. I'm not huge on using BMI since it doesn't work great for tall people


I started the 90Days by doing about 45 days of Paleo + Beer. It helped me break through a plateau at about 190 pounds where I have been stuck for a year. In all I lost about thirteen pounds

Measurements did not change much. Biceps, thighs and forearms had nearly zero change. Hips, waist and chest were a decent change at about -2.5"" throughout. I can do about 15 more pushups than I could in the beginning, but that's not saying much.

Exercises consisted of daily bicycle commuting to work (~10 miles round trip) and some dumbbell exercises. I really need to figure out how to do more weights so I can pack on some muscle

Next round I am going to see if I can do C25K along with cycling

Aside from getting shitfaced, shall we!

So, or sugar free red bull, you bring the calories down by a staggering amount.

I decided it would also be a good thing to talk about today. Does anyone use any apps currently to track their fitness or nutrition? How have they worked for you?

I personally have had no way to track my workouts and nutrition by phone until now. So I am curious to see how other people like it and what they use. Its pretty well known that keeping track of things like calories and workouts can help you stay on track and help you make better decisions. Nutrition benefits greatly when you know you cant afford that cupcake compared to guessing. Exercise is so much easier when you know exactly how much weight you lifted yesterday and how you felt doing it. If you dont currently use any apps I might suggest giving it a try. You never know what you might like. Specifically in the /r/fitness faq there are some apps you can look into. 

What are your goals today? Any big plans in the name of fitness? I have some weight lifting over lunch but thats about it. Good Luck everyone!

My past obstacles were abuse as a child, grief from losing a sibling, depression, quitting smoking, childbirth, being a new mother, and an injury or two. Now, and so will you!

Sup daily goal individuals. Now if we are honest with ourselves each one of us throughout the week will have moments of weakness. Psychologically dieting and sticking to our goals is difficult. It requires us to be on our game and make decisions consistently. So lets mention something about our weaknesses. As a group we can certainly help each other find our weaknesses and propose solutions.

Personally there is a small amount of time between lunch and dinner when I am sitting at my desk alone and often hungry. I have a hard time not going to get a snack from the vending machine or a candy bar from whatever kid is playing a sport at the current time. This is the hardest time for me not to eat extra calories or food that isn’t quite as clean. I have tried a few things but somehow my desire to eat something unhealthy and especially because no one around me cares about what I eat I have a hard time sticking to healthy alternatives. I have tried sunflower seeds and having a protein shake and just sucking it up but I still sink back to wanting some carbs or a candy bar. 

While our weaknesses are not our favorite things to think about a diet can only be as good as the bottom line. Pick up the bottom line and you will be able to see more progress in a week. So lets hear em.

ALSO IMPORTANT PLEASE REMEMBER TO CHECK IN IF YOU HAVENT DONE SO ALREADY. This is for our stats and to help keep your statistics tracked with us. 

Have a great day everyone!

We have 86 people signed up for the [90 Days Goal](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/17/) group on Fitocracy though, let me know. We just ran out yesterday, but Dick said he'll give us more later today!

So the whole team thing is new this round

I'm planning to keep setting up group challenges for us on Fitocracy throughout the round. The current challenge ends at the end of June. When I set up the next one, monthly challenges? 

Are there any fun/friendly challenges that we could set up for ourselves throughout the round? Something along the lines of the planks challenge that Mr_Nox and I have been doing. Nothing too stressful

What about weekly(?) Fitocracy threads to see how everyone is doing? Something around the lines of the ""What were your victories of the past week?"" threads that missdeejers posts to xxfitness. 

So... let's introduce ourselves and toss out any ideas for the group!

Well, still need to do some thinking.

At the start of the round

Weight: 181lb

Body fat: 12.7% (!) This fluctuates

Muscle mass: 42.4%

My goals for this round were:

1) Reach 185 lbs

I think I achieved this, went up to 186, and battled it back down again.

2) Carry on c25k. Reach at least week 6 level of workout. 

I did this, and really helped with my endurance.  I had little incentive to continue after that, but I did pick up with the bike riding instead.

3) Increase my pec dec/seated chest press (I've not done them before so not sure what to expect. They are currently 50lbs each

I had completely forgotten about this, and am working on the 100 push-ups program - started being able to do 15, can now do 33.

4) Be cycling to work at least once per week.

Complete success here

5) Be fit enough to pass the P90X basic fitness test. I plan to do P90X in Round 4.

I can now actually pass the P90X test, plus I would have to adapt P90X to fit with my cycling, so I am not going to do this.

Overall, aerobic and anaerobic fitness, which gives me a chance to make that decision later.  Now time to go out and buy some new clothes, that fit!

A lot of us achieved a good percentage of our goals. In fact we have compiled a few spreadsheets and charts on data that you guys provided us. We are hoping to use one such chart to encourage and bring more people into the group. Is everyone who submitted their stats happy to have their user name against a simple bar chart that shows the total weight and weight after 90 days? Nothing else

Negativity.  Whether it be from others or from ourselves, seems jealous of my lifestyle change.  You must be thick skinned in situations such as these.  When a person decides to lose weight or gain muscle, it doesn't go without notice amonst friends and family.  And while it would be ideal for everyone to be supportive, there is a great possibility that you will come across someone that is the opposite.  Actions can speak louder than words.  And having friends that try to continually convince you to eat something you shouldnt or go out drinking instead of working out can be counterproductive.  Of course we all have days where we want to relax.  As you should.  But be wary of patterns that start to rear their heads.  I'm going to take a [direct quote](http://www.suite101.com/content/negative-comments-can-disrupt-weight-loss-programs-a300199) :

**""For many people who have decided to control their weight in a healthy way

**When those in a group generally share the same issues, when one or two in a group change the status quo, then the rest feel anxious and reminded that their behaviors too need changing. People may feel envious of the dieter’s new empowerment and determination and often there are feelings of jealousy.""**

While we do not have someone condensing sources, we still do have many of those materials. So, the question is how do we want to execute this ?  

As we are all in this together, I think working as a whole is a bit better for us, as we all have our goals to meet. Gaining, losing, really it is all the same when we focus on the health-based ramifications.  

So, your weights, or whatever you have; as long as we have a good foundation of nutrition and calories (and if we do not, we can always venture into /r/fitness land and read up), then we should begin a transition from theory to execution, beginning tonight. Tomorrow. Whenever you feel comfortable, but not too long down the road.

Dealing with this injury is one of those things in fitness where its just not great. I get out climbing but I am weak from the rest and I can't climb what I want because I need to hold back while it heals. 

Over the past 70 days you have experienced ups and downs and fantastic days and bad days. The important thing to remember is that you are working towards a goal that will always be good for you. A healthier lifestyle or losing/gaining weight. It everything went perfectly you wouldnt be human. So just remember to take the bad with the good and keep working hard. You only fail when you quit not when you get back on the horse.

So let us know what you are going to do today in the name of your goals!

Do you give in and have a bit?  Or does giving in and having a bit make you just eat more?  Do you try to find a healthier substitute?  If so

Welcome to the start of week 4!  Can you believe it's almost been 30 days since we started?!  Just a little bit longer and you'll have made it through the first sprint!

Today I want to talk about **workout music**!  What do you listen to when you work out?  Do you have different playlists for different types of workouts?  What's your favorite genre to listen to?  If you don't bring any music to your workouts, share your playlists or tell us what to look for, be it Pandora or just a compilation of songs you put together.

Have an awesome day!

Today we’re going to discuss our **gym bag essentials**!  This is something I’m always curious about, some might prefer to record activities on their phones, others might remember it, and some might not take note at all!  What do you find necessary to keep in your gym bag and take with you when you head out to do some exercise?  Do you usually take “real” clothes and things to freshen up afterwards, or do you do all of that at home?

Let us know what gear you take along!  Additionally... **FOOD FRIDAY**!  If you have any awesome new (or old... they’ll still be new to us!) recipes

It just puts an interesting spin on things when someone is supportive of my fitness. To be honest most people don't ask or care and those who do find it a little more extreme than the norm and worry about me.  I almost find this kind of unfortunate because I do consider myself a good resource and would love to help more people. 

So how often do people talk to you about your fitness goals? Do you often offer up the info willingly? Is it something you keep closer to the chest? As we work on setting new goals for this coming round do you tell a lot of people or work on yourself silently? An interesting part of fitness for me has always been how it comes into play with my relationships. 

Just a thought for you today. So whats on the agenda? Anything exciting today in the name of fitness? Sacrificing any sweat to the iron? Let us know!

What is one of your favorite recipes?  If you have more than one, type it out so we can all try it out.  I'm sure a lot of you have a huge collection of delicious recipes and I want in on that collection.

If you are following a particular diet or food-restriction (vegetarian, you can make a note of it so people who are following a similar diet can find your recipe fairly quickly.

Since we started this round

These sacrifices could be types of food or it could be your social life.  Some people stop going out when they are trying to better their health simply because going out is too tempting and unhealthy for them.  Others can manage it but have to still make small sacrifices

How does sacrificing the things you did make you feel?  Do you miss and/or crave them still or have you replaced what has been sacrificed with something else?  Basically

This week’s topic is something that is plays an ENORMOUS role in running

First, meaning that your heel is the first part of your foot to hit the ground and then roll towards the ball of your foot.  This is similar to how you walk - try taking a few steps and think about how your foot “rolls” from heel to toe, and that’s similar to how your foot hits the ground while running.  Another type of foot strike that some runners use is a *mid-foot strike*, where that initial pressure as you strike the ground is in the middle area of the foot.  There is a third type of foot strike, most often found in barefoot or minimalist running, is a *forefoot strike*, meaning that the ball of the foot is what hits the ground first.  This type of running also often applies to sprinters - next time you sprint, a mid-foot strike is also fairly common.  

Now that we’ve talked about foot strike, their foot will initially strike on the outer side of the heel and roll towards the center of the body in order to distribute the weight evenly, and their knees usually stay in line over the big toe; this is natural and ideal.  For someone with *overpronation*, their foot will also initially strike on the lateral side of the heel, but as it rolls toward the center of the body it will roll too far and the weight will be distributed unevenly, and the knee will often track inward; overpronation causes shock to not be absorbed as well, and can result in problems with collapsing arches or ankles rolling inwards.  For someone with *underpronation*, though the foot won’t roll far enough

So, shoes are often designed with these things in mind!  A lot of running shoes have cushioning or padding, especially in the heel (as opposed to the forefront) since that tends to be the area of the foot that pounds on the ground and have the most pressure on it.  *Minimalist shoes*, however, don’t have particularly much padding and are designed to be fairly close to being barefoot, but with protection for your feet from whatever you may encounter on your run.  For neutral runners, they usually just use *neutral shoes* with regular padding, as well as neutral runners

How do you know what type of shoe is best for you?  I would suggest going to a running store and getting fitted - after being properly fitted at a specialty store, I love them so much that when I got new running shoes a few weeks ago I wound up sticking with the same ones, and just upgraded to the new version :D

Now on to the **questions for this week**:

* How did you pick your shoes?  Were you fitted or did you chose them on your own?  How do you like them?
* Do you know what type you need, or neutral pronator?
* Have you tried barefoot or minimalist running?  What was your experience with that?
* How often do you get a new pair of shoes?  Was it a difficult transition
* Any other shoe-related comments?

* Eating cookies makes you need to exercise even more. It's OK to eat a few treats
* Don't let a bad decision spiral into a week of gluttony. Have a few treats on Christmas morning
* Exercise reduces stress and makes you feel great - two things you need if you have a family like mine.

How is everyone doing today?  Are you all ready for the holidays?  How are you doing with your goals?  Are you still on track?  What's planned for today and this weekend?

Since we're wrapping up the second week and almost halfway through the first sprint

What do you to stay on track?  What's the most likely thing to derail you?  Do you have a hard time picking yourself back up again?  Do you ever reward yourself when you stay consistent?

Think about what can derail you and come up with a plan on how to circumvent that or at least mitigate it.  When life gets in the way, or are you going to drop one or the other?

**What diet is optimal for a runner?**  

Well, I’m not saying that you must eat all-healthy all-the-time - I tend to indulge in some froyo or chocolate every now and then - but it’s important to find a balance.  There are so many different diets out there, and each can be modified and tailored to you.  Some people have found success with a ketogenic diet (check out [r/keto] (http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/), some prefer a paleo diet ([r/paleo] (http://www.reddit.com/r/paleo/), others prefer higher carb, and others prefer something totally different!  You need to find what ultimately works for you and check in with yourself to see how your body responds and performs in reaction to what you’re eating.  If you aren’t sure, try keeping a food log and exercise log - after you are done exercising, and was there any difference in what you ate?  

A lot of us are trying to lose weight here, [this] (http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning-0?page=single) may be a useful article.  Side note:  I some had trouble finding the full article it lists at the bottom that it adapted the info from, but managed to download a copy of it through my university library.  If you’d like me to send you it then just PM me and I’d be happy to email it along.  

I’d also like to include a bit about hydration - not quite food, drink, drink!!

So now that I’ve posted a bit of information above

* What sort of diet have you found works best for you to fuel your daily life and your running?  If you are still trying to figure it out
* What is your go-to pre-running meal or snack
* Post-running?
* Does your pre-race meal vary from your usual pre-running food?
* Hydration - do you prefer water?  Gatorade? Something else?
* Fuel during runs - do you use any fuel *during* your runs?  Blocks? Gels? Bursts? Bars? And at what point in your run do you take them?  To the people who are new to running and aren’t sure what this means

For this first week

* How did you get into running?  How long have you been running?
* Do you have a running goal for Round 9 as a whole
* Do you have a specific training plan you are going to follow?  Please share :D (side note, [Bridge to 10K] (http://blog.bluefinapps.com/about-bridge-to-10k/), [Half-Marathon] (http://www.runnersworld.com/training-plans/half-marathon-training-plans), [Marathon] (http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_4/143.shtml))
* Do you have any upcoming races and any goal times?
* Any cool running accomplishments that you’d like to share?  It doesn’t have to be about races
* Do you have any ideas for future running thread topics that you would like to see?
* Anything else you’d like to tell us about yourself

Here’s a little bit about me - 

*  I’m fairly new to running, so I started running more... I had previously HATED running and only did it when I needed to for high school sports, but something clicked this time around and I’ve come to enjoy it!  
*  For Round 9 as a whole, and would like to get to a sub-27min 5K.  Currently, I’m around 29:09 from a test run that I did last Wednesday.  For Sprint 1, I’m hoping to get down to about 28:15.
*  Training plan... not following anything specific, run 3-4x/week (two or three shorter runs between 3-5 miles, or more as I increase mileage, and one long run), and a rest day!
*  I haven’t signed up for any races, though I did find a 5K in February that looks somewhat promising...   Goal time for my next half may be about 2:10,  which would require me to drop about 15 minutes from my first half, slightly over a minute per mile (so I would need to do 10ish minute miles the whole time) - any experienced runners think this is feasible, or should I not aim to drop so much time?  Goal time for 5K is hopefully sub-27min by the end of the round!  I’d also like to do a sprint triathlon, which includes a 5K run, and a marathon at some point during 2013.
*  I did a half-marathon the Sunday before Thanksgiving
* I’m trying to come up with ideas
* Quick run-down of myself:  22F, nervous but excited for my first winter running season, big fan of listening to fast-paced pop, alternative, and hip-hop while running... anything with a solid beat to keep me movin’!

So, concerns, suggestions, input on anyone’s training plans, or whatever, feel free to comment or respond to each other’s posts - any way we can help each other out in achieving our goals is awesome :D",,self,self8,

Speaking of houses

The ghost of old injuries has come back to haunt me today. With the weather being crazy, my old ankle injury and my bad wrist have both been causing me considerable soreness and a little angst. Additionally, I jogged a little bit to catch up with the dogs' running, and the tissue in my abdomen prone to soreness is, surprise, a little sore. I think it's time for my boyfriend to start taking the dogs out for a few days.

Preventative care advice seems like cold comfort when you've already got some busted body parts. To cope with mine, whatever. I wore an ankle brace for about 6 months to support my ankle after twisting it while camping. Looks like it's time to bust it out again on a selective basis. Upgrading my shoes may also work; I've got old sneakers and movable shoe inserts that keep my arches supported but may not provide all the support I need to keep my ankle from turning in a pothole or when the dogs pull me down a steep hill.

Tell me about your palliative care that keeps you going

Well, I bought glittery stilletos (oh yes I did) &amp; a pink push up bra.  So I made it work lol.  &amp;since I waited last minute, my weekend was filled w/ a lot of running around.  I need to post a picture of the get up later! :D

So we are Day 68

Edit: Alright now I have a few minutes. It has been an insane week for me. I tweaked my knee on Sunday doing limbo at a bar :( Let me tell you how embarrassing that is to tell people. Pretty sure I can barely walk well. Its really ridiculous. But I am doing what I need to get better and will go see a doctor if it stops showing signs of improvement. So for now I am just resting and watching my diet.

How is your week going? Have you had to deal with Injuries lately? Do you know how to deal with one if it creeps up. Or if you limbo to hard? I really am an idiot haha. Its a theme for me to hurt myself in inane ways while on vacation. I'm glad this is no exception. Have a great day everyone!

We've almost got two full weeks under our belts!  We're all working hard towards our goals

Sometimes negativity towards your lifestyle change comes in the form of people saying things like ""you need to eat a cheeseburger, such as ""You don't need to lose weight!"" or ""Man, keep this up and you'll start making me look bad.""  No matter how it is presented, it can really throw you off your game.  Your support system may crumble.  Friends may stop taking your dietary restrictions into consideration when going out or at the very least, make them seem less important.

How does negativity manifest itself in your life?  What do you do when this happens (how do you react)?  Do you shoot a snarky comment back at the haters?  Or do you let the issue slide and keep doing what you're doing?  Or even stop trying for that one moment?  

I want to know how you deal with negativity!

As always, comparisons, or just flat out want to brag about a recent PR or lift - share away!

--------

**Weekly Discussion Topic: Nutrition**

This week's topic is **nutrition**.  Nutrition is *incredibly* important, but a bad diet can and will invalidate even the most dedicated of lifting routines. Depending on what your goals are, you'll be on either a caloric surplus or deficit. Regardless of whether you're trying to go up or down, protein is about to become your new best friend.


***Protein: The one constant in workout nutrition***


Muscle growth is dependent on the cycle of imposing stress on your muscle fibers through your workout

There are a lot of recommendations on how much protein is enough: 1g/lb body weight, activity level, and a whole host of other factors. Since there is no real danger in getting too *much* protein, the most practical method to go by is to use a range and to aim high. For *most* people on *most* routines, getting 1 gram of protein per pound of total body weight (lean mass and fat) is enough.

Now that you know how much - you might be wondering when to consume this protein. First of all, you can chow down however you wish.

Don't worry about getting your protein *immediately* after your workout, and you'll be just fine!

A word on protein shakes. They're not magic, as you can take your normal diet, slap in 2 scoops of whey protein and immediately get 50-60g more protein per day, but they aren't required. If you find yourself needing more protein, you can add shakes. You could also add chicken, turkey, ground beef, eggs, lentils... you get the idea! Looking for a specific brand? [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard](http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Standard-Double-Chocolate/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1) is frequently seen as one of the better brands. I prefer chocolate

***Nutrition on a bulk: EAT ALL THE THINGS!***


Eating on a bulk is fun. There are two main schools of thought: ""Clean"" bulking/eating, aka ""dirty"" bulking. I'm not going to get into a debate between one versus the other - other than to say that they are both options, many people have had a lot of success with both. If you want to eat chicken &amp; veggies to pack on muscle, go for it. If you want to have the occasional (or often) big mac...you can fit that in too.

To properly feed yourself on a bulk, you need to eat above maintenance. Simply eating at maintenance and lifting won't do you a whole lot of good for bulking. You can't ""turn muscle into fat"" directly, so to gain weight, you need to eat at a surplus. Pretty simple, right?

Going a little deeper into details, tack on 500 extra calories per day and start recording your weight. If you haven't seen a noticeable weight gain after 2 weeks, you probably want to up your intake by another 300-500 calories, and calculate again in another 2 weeks. For most people, a safe target to shoot for is 0.5 - 1lb of weight gained per week.

These are the *basics*. There's a lot more advanced options out there that take this basic principle a step further to maximize muscle gain and minimize fat gain. LeanGains attempts to cycle your intake and your macros so that you consume at a surplus on lifting days


***Nutrition on a cut: Playing the numbers game***


Eating and lifting while trying to lose weight a little bit trickier. The same principles apply: rule #1 - get enough protein. This time, which will put you in a target area of 1lb/week lost.


One very important note here though is that there is such a thing as losing too much weight too fast. One [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615) (popular on reddit) suggests that there is a maximum rate of fat your body can lose per day

The reason this is so important is that you don't want to ""make up"" for one day by overdoing it the other day. If your maintenance is 2, and you're only going to rob yourself of that hard earned muscle. The scale might tell you it worked out, but your muscles will tell you another story.

When you're on a surplus, and fats to keep you full - there's plenty of everything. When you're on a cut, just getting enough protein can be rough. For me, my off days on a cut are 1,800 calories, and I aim to get at least 180 grams of protein - not always easy! 

There's no real ""trick"" to this I've found - you need to be dedicated to tracking your calories, carb, and fat goals for the day, you'll implicitly hit your calorie goals. This can be a ""simpler"" way to track everything rather than working backwards off calories.

We're halfway through the first week and I know most of you have already started exercising and are getting off of the right foot.  When you exercise, the better!

For those of you who are getting started with lifting weight, pilates, dance, etc., do you wear footies to help keep traction?  What about gloves (same goes for you, weight lifters)?

[Yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y77yu/dailygoal_day_2_august_14_2012/) we discussed diet

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now
Our [Weekly Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y52xo/weekly_challenge_week_1/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up

* Cardio is great, check out nymeatball’s weekly [[WEIGHTLIFTING] posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y99he/weightlifting_week_1_getting_started/)!

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K)

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play tennis.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/)

* If you haven't done so already

How is everyone doing today? Its a Thursday and thats all I have to say about that. So last week I asked people about their sleep and some people mentioned that they needed some more and some said they get enough. 

I'm curious did anyone make any effort to sleep more over the past week? How has it helped? Has it made any difference good or bad? Do you find it hard to find time for sleep?

I didnt sleep well last night even though I got 8.5 hours. Weird how that works. I even worked out twice yesterday!

Anyways today is going to be Yoga and climbing laps on the rocks. What are you doing today in the name of fitness?

Last round we had public challenges which means that any other user on Fitocracy was able to join. We voted on that one and it was decided that this round the challenges stay private, which means a little bit more work for you, but I am sure it just requires a few minutes of your time to join. What now follows is a detailed description of steps necessary for you to join the challenges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group

In the best case scenario, and of course to finish the first sprint which we are almost half way trough, so hang in there people. I always like to hear feedback, so if you feel like you are losing it or have another question, make yourself heard.

Another point that is interesting on that day is of course

So far this week we've set goals, decided on our diet, started our fitness plans, and generally been completely awesome. Next week, it's time to get down to business and work towards those goals. How are you going to work out? How are you going to follow that diet? What about the week after that? **What's going to keep you motivated to keep going?**

Let's talk inspiration!

**Who or what is inspiring you on your fitness journey?**

Personally, I want to be able to keep up with her as she gets older and more involved in sports. I am also doing this for myself, to prove I can and to see if I can finally feel good about how I look. I got tired of hating myself and decided to change it. My health also plays into it, as I have Fibromyalgia (newly diagnosed) and am looking to keep the pain away for as long as I can.

The image that inspires me the most is [this unknown woman](http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hot-fit-girls-26.jpg). She has the body I am striving for and I look at it every single day to remind myself what I am working towards. I also watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loszrEZvS_k) every day

* Run longer/faster


Accomplishments:

* Lost 16 pounds (151 lbs - 134.8 lbs)

* Achieved my ideal goal weight (under 135 lbs)

* Ran 9 miles at a time (longest before this round was ~6)

* Ran a 5k in under 27 min (longest before this round was ~28 min)

* Ran 2 miles non-stop at 8 min pace


I tried to keep to around 1500 calories a day, a lot, like at least 6 days a week.  I am training for a half-marathon in May, so that helped the motivation.  Anything else you want to know, ask!  Also, here are some progress pics!

I had a bit of a surprise this morning - I'm up *5 lbs* since the end of Round 6.  Too much post-round snacking and not enough tracking on MFP.  Damn.  My goal for today is to get my head back in the game and track everything!

What are your goals for today?

Hope everyone is doing well for their round. What are your big plans for the day? Doing anything fun related to fitness or your diet? I actually am going to start doing some yoga today after I sprained my foot and am finally able to workout again. 

Do any of you have any injuries currently that might affect your workouts? I havent been able to climb or run for over 2 weeks so I really had to focus on my diet. Maybe other people might have similar issues and they can help with giving you some tips to stay on track.

Let's get started with a motivational quote:

&gt; The hardest thing about exercise is to start doing it. Once you are doing exercise regularly

I'm trying to keep that kind of mindset.  Because I was SUPPOSED to go back Crossfit last week BUT $$.  So it's ""Take 2"" is this week.  I really just need to hit my stride &amp; run w/ it.  But we'll see.

So...!  Let's talk about you?  How did you do on your goals yesterday?  Have you made your goals for today?  If so

My goal is to continue eating healthy.  Im doing alright diet-wise

I can't believe 90 days have past already! Since everyone is posting their final progress for this round

Anyway
I am a 5'7"" female.  I originally started by weight loss journey in March of 2011.  I was 222 at that point and really tired of looking at pictures of myself and feeling ashamed. So my total weight loss since march has been 43 pounds!  
I have also lost a few pant sizes.  I have gone from a size 16 to a size 11-12. I am THRILLED by this! My goal weight is somewhere between 150-160.  I plan on getting getting down to around 150 then shifting my workout balance to more weightlifting and less cardio to gain some muscle.  

I am looking forward to the next round where I hope to achieve my goal weight!

Happy New Year everyone! ",self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/nv0kk/progress_90_day_goal_achieved/

But seriously, and since I'm on this subreddit daily already and enjoy motivating people and encouraging goals, here I am for the rest of the round to keep things interesting. :)

SOooooooo... what I need to know from all of you is this: What would you like from this team? Right now you have the opportunity for a brand new fresh start with fresh leader blood (muahahaahaaaa) at a time when motivation is probably starting to waver - mid way through the round

So

I've got some ideas but I need YOUR input since, well, I'm here all the time anyway. :D 

Ideas that I have: we could turn this into kind of a blog of posts where people can just sort of yammer about what's going on in their lives and we can all be supportive of each other and keep that communication and interest in this team going - sometimes all it takes to keep motivation going is just knowing someone is THERE. 

Other ideas

Another idea is that we could have a meta-discussion about motivation, and maybe come up with some ideas (even if just through trial and error) to get the structures in place to keep us honoring our commitments to ourselves.

Anyway, and how I can assist you in achieving that and we'll go from there. :)",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,gold5,

Stress is too broad of a term though. As many of you may know, if you get a good grade on that exam, then you may experience eustress. Both types of stress are necessary for you to maintain a proper demeanor and mindset, but too much of either can cause problems too.

Now that we know what stress is and that it's unavoidable, sleeping, and other passive ways to relieve stress. Others prefer to exercise, hang out with friends, or some other more active way to relive stress. Also, some people prefer to relieve stress through smoking, alcohol use

1317697119.0,l03hw,[Runners] Topic: Breathing and Side Stitches,Mr_Nox,10,1,7,"Hi everyone.  This week's discussion topic for the Runners group is *proper breathing technique and how to avoid side stitches*.

Portions are from [Dave Elger](http://daveelger.articlesbase.com/sports-and-fitness-articles/improve-your-running-with-proper-breathing-45455.html) and [Chi Running](http://www.chirunning.com/chi-library/article/breathe-easy/).

*****
**The Problem of Shallow Breathing**

The most important thing to remember about breathing while running is that you are trying to get as much oxygen into your system, it is important to remember to breathe as deeply as possible.  

Many runners will do *shallow breathing*, resulting in increased heart rate, and the release of stress hormones like cortisol.  This causes the body to burn blood sugar and store fat and raises blood pressure as a result of lower oxygenation rates, which ultimately overloads the adrenal glands.

**Belly Breathing**

One useful technique to master is *belly breathing*, lowering your heart rate and blood pressure, improving circulation, and producing an overall calming effect and feeling of well-being.

Place your hands over your belly button. Now purse your lips like you're trying to blow a candle out and exhale, once you get comfortable with belly breathing you can introduce it into your running.  The main thing to remember is to fully empty your lungs before inhaling again.

**Proper Posture Works Wonders**

Many runners will tend to slouch as they get tired, it is much more difficult to breath deeply.  Slouching is often the result of a generally weak core, and core exercises like planks, crunches, and hip bridges will help immensely \(Runner's World has a [great set of core workout videos](http://goo.gl/nRTN9)\).

When you catch yourself slouching, tighten your core, and stretch your abdomen up by taking one hand and pushing down at your belly button while the other hand pushes up on your rib cage.

**Relax!**

This is related to slouching.  If you notice your body tensing up

The cure for this is easy - *simply relax*.  Drop your shoulders

**Cadence and Side Stitches**

Runners should be inhaling and exhaling through both nose AND mouth to a set pattern or rhythm. Most elite runners breathe to a 2-2 rhythm. They breathe in while taking 2 steps and out while taking 2 steps.

i.e. Left foot- begin exhale, Right foot- continue inhale

One problem with this approach is the habit of always inhaling or exhaling on the same footfall, or even change your breathing rhythm to exhale on alternating right and left footfalls, using a 3-2 rhythm:

i.e. Left foot- begin inhale, Right foot- continue exhale, Left foot - continue exhale, Right foot- begin inhale ",,False,self,False,t3_l03hw

###Running programs

If you're not sure where to start

* [**Couch to 5K (C25K)**](http://www.c25k.com) is a great program to take you from absolutely no experience all the way to completing a full 5km run. Lots of 90ers are following or have already completed the Couch to 5K program and there are a lot of great apps, I would highly recommend you start here first. If it's too easy or too hard, you can try moving to one of the other programs below.

* [**Conservative Couch to 5K**](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/Programs/conservative_program.htm) takes you from absolutely no experience to completing a full 5km run using a slower progression than the C25K program. The first month of the program is entirely walking

* [**Bridge to 10K**](http://blog.c25kapp.com/about-bridge-to-10k/) is intended to take you from 5K to 10K runs. It's a great extension for C25K graduates.

* [**Podrunner Intervals**](http://www.djsteveboy.com/intervals.html) have some great podcasts to get you running 5K

* **Hal Higdon** has [5K](http://www.halhigdon.com/5K%20Training/index.htm), and [marathon](http://www.halhigdon.com/marathon/Mar00index.htm) training programs, to name [just a few](http://www.halhigdon.com/).

* **Chi Running** has [training programs](http://www.chirunning.com/learn-it/training-programs/) for 5K, and is great for beginners as well as experienced runners.

The first team challenge is still in effect! Which team will be the first to 100% check-ins? The top team has 88% of their members checked in already. There are several teams that are neck and neck with more than 70% of team members checked in. And there are four teams with only one member left to check in. So let's see some more check-ins to support your teams!

Let's also try out a personal challenge for everyone today: Whenever you get the chance, take as many flights as you can before you switch to the elevator. How many flights can you fit in today?

And now tell us all about your goals for today. How did your plans go yesterday? Any excitement today?

Your typical boneless breast has 269 calories, and 0 carbohydrates. 
873 mg potassium

I like it grilled
So our 'go-to' way to fix it is just to cook in a wearever skillet (kind of a pressure cooker) with olive oil.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, I think Mrs. dash garlic and herb is one.  If you are using a standard skillet, you're probably going to need to add some liquid at some point: white wine, vermouth, broth, or even water.

When there's time to fire up the oven, thyme, and rosemary.   Roll each breast around in the oil and lay on a broiler pan, with some water in the bottom tray of the pan.   Roast either slow at 350 til tender, or as high as 425 to speed up the process (but you better have water in that pan or you'll see a lot of smoke in the kitchen).

Some stats on me, and had just nudged 100kg / 220lb.  I was always skinny when I was younger, typically non-athletic computer nerd, but over time I just gained weight slowly, maybe 4kg a year for 10 years.  I know I weighed 85kg in early 2007.  I didn't do any exercise, and ate whatever I liked.  I'd had terrible luck at the gym as aside from a belly, I *look* like I'm in good shape - well-defined arms and legs.  Personal Trainers gave me way too much to do, some trainers actually got very worried about this

So my goals were (not specifically for 2 months)

* lose some weight
* Increase my endurance
* Change my lifestyle into something more healthy.

I got hold of P90X, it gave me something to work towards.  I started with the ""cooldown"" stretching workout, I couldn't even finish that!  2 weeks later, I was doing the regular workouts, with short breaks, and could do the cooldown without breaking a sweat.  I continued like this for a month, then in preparation for moving house, I'm starting c25k.  I've always had terrible shinsplints

At the same time

* No more crap.  At all.  This means sugary drinks or snacks, crisps, alcohol (though I never was much of a drinker), fried or deepfried foods, mayonnaise, high fat dairy (including stuff like pizza)
* Moderate carb intake.  Don't eat pasta every day.  Switch to brown bread where possible.  Don't eat sandwiches all the time.  Don't overdo it with fruit
* Increase lean protein intake.  Have grilled meat and fish
* Never go hungry.  Always eat as much as you want.  As long as it's healthy stuff

Here is a chart of my weight

Aside from my body trolling me the last week and refusing to lose that last pound, with slow, gradual weight loss.  My net calories have trended upwards since the end of january, that is when I was moving house and getting settled in.  Even though it's ""noisy"" recently, I am still way under my calorie goals - which to lose 1lb a week, is 2050 a day.  I'm averaging about 1500, which I'm happy with.

How about results?  I've taken some photos, and clothes are looser.  My strength has not increased, but my endurance has, which is more important (and gives me the capacity to work on the strength).  I also fit into suits from 3 years ago that I couldn't wear anymore :)  So I feel this is a good foundation, I just have to keep at it.

So what do I want to do for Round 3?  Well, by continuing c25k, and the weight machines I have access to (new block of flats has a gym :) ). I want to increase my strength, and my endurance to be able to do more at the end of the 3 months.  

Enough messing about

* Reach 185 lbs
* Carry on c25k.  Reach at least week 6 level of workout.  Fwiw
* Increase my pec dec/seated chest press (I've not done them before so not sure what to expect.  They are currently 50lbs each
* Be cycling to work at least once per week.
* Be fit enough to pass the P90X basic fitness test.  I plan to do P90X in Round 4.

My goal was to stay on track w/ the diet, so I got my heart beating a big.  Dinner was simple--turkey pitas.  I stuffed two thin slices of turkey in a pita with tomatoes, carmelized onions and spinach.  I popped them in the oven til they got a bit crispy and immediately threw in a pinch of low fat mozzarella cheese &amp; diced avocado.  I then thickly sliced some cucumbers into coins to replicate chips and had that w/ some pico de gallo.  Today is our dreaded Thanksgiving luncheon--gravy, pie, and more pie!  I brought an extra pita pocket and will use some of the turkey for my lunch.  But that's all Im getting outta that lol.  As for exercise, I'm gonna go to the gym and get on the treadmill/circuit training.  As for dinner--I'm thinking salmon or tilapia.  Huzzah!  All in all, so far so good.

As you may have noticed, it **was** tasty...  So much so that I didn’t get this ready yesterday.

You would think that would lead into a topic about ‘healthy’ cheat foods.  And you’d be wrong!  Today we’re going to talk about cooking for small groups of people - one or two.

Obviously there are challenges when you’re cooking for one.  Recipes are typically scaled for 6 to 8 people, more expensive ingredients, or larger portioned, with the risk that they’ll go bad before you use them up.  

For some ingredients, and other non-perishables.  But, you get to select your amount.  Nothing says you **need* to buy a large portion...  You can buy the amount you need instead of buying a prepackaged amount in the grocery store.

When you cook, or whether you eat larger portions than you probably need to make it go faster, or whether you end up throwing away the left overs.  You can attempt to scale the recipe down, but that doesn’t work for everything, so you may find that you can’t make some meals that you enjoy. And sometimes there is no option about scaling a recipe down.  Its hard to find a ‘small’ turkey...

Another strategy can be to try to plan your meals to use up the leftovers in successive meals.  For instance, ham omelette, etc.  

One key thing when cooking for one or two people is planning.  If you want to minimize your food expense and wasted food

What’s your strategy?",self,t5_2s0sd,False,TastyTuesdays,self9,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1jur5e/tasty_tuesday_7_aug_cooking_for_one_or_two/
1375357288.0,1jhkq4,[Runners] - Week 3 - Diet and Fuel,dinosaurdinosrawr,9,1,16,"Good morning


This week’s topic is **how you fuel your body**.  Nutrition definitely plays a big role in performance and a lot of you mentioned it as something you’d like to see a thread about, vegetarian, vegan, and various non-name-having “diets” - so I thought it would be interesting for us all to discuss how we feel our own, personal, diets impact our running.  A lot of us also may have changed our diets over the span of our running careers, so maybe you noticed a change in your performance accompanying a change in diet.


**What diet is optimal for a runner?**  Well, you need to find what works for you and check in with yourself to see how your body responds and performs in reaction to what you’re eating - if you’re having trouble figuring it out, then I would suggest maybe keeping a food diary where you log what you eat and how you feel after eating, during your workout, post-workout, etc. and see what makes you feel best and what doesn’t.


It’s really important to fuel your body properly and with enough calories and nutrients to keep yourself feeling good.  A lot of us are trying to lose weight, you may need to “eat back” some of your calories.  If you are interested in calculating how many calories you are burning per mile, [this] (http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning?page=2 may be a useful article.  [Side note:  I some had trouble finding the full article it lists at the bottom that it adapted the info from, but managed to eventually find a copy.  If you’d like me to send you it then just PM me and I’d be happy to email it along.] 


So let’s get some discussion going about what we find works for us


* What sort of diet have you found works best for you to fuel your daily life and your running?  Have you switched from one diet to another?  If so, you experienced any changes)
* What is your go-to pre-running meal or snack
* Post-running?
* Hydration - do you prefer water?  Gatorade? Something else?
* Fuel during runs - do you use any fuel *during* your runs?  Blocks? Gels? Bursts? Bars? Candy? Something else?  And at what point in your run do you take them?

1374553426.0,1iv4cf,How do you learn to eat? [Question],ameliorates,10,3,15,"TL;DR: first world problems. Possible trigger warning?

God, so here goes.

I cannot make myself eat if I don't feel hungry... which wouldn't be a problem, but it got a lot worse a couple years ago. Without boring you with the details, I **had** to eat every few hours and the circumstances led to me developing a *very* strong aversion to eating when I was not hungry. As in, attempting to do so leaves me battling serious nausea.

I like food! I like eating. I'm 100% certain I do not have an eating disorder. I think I either have a hard time recognizing initial hunger cues, I have about a 15-30 minute window in which to eat or it passes and I don't feel hungry anymore, even though I know I was just hungry an hour ago. And then I'm back to trying to talk myself into eating something even though the thought of doing so turns my stomach.

I typically skip breakfast (food never sounds good in the morning), skip dinner because I had a late lunch, feel sick late in the evening, realize I haven't eaten again, smoke to relieve the discomfort/fake an appetite, then eat everything in the house. 

I don't know what ""I'm going to be hungry soon"" feels like

I don't even know if I'm supposed to be hungry. Do you guys eat because you're hungry or because it's time to eat? If the latter

Any tips, thanks, doc.) I'd really prefer not to exacerbate my aversion to food any more, but I'm really, really, *really* tired of fighting my body over this and feeling like garbage every.single.night.  :/",[Question],self,self11,

Now that week 3 is drawing to a close, there are some of you that aren't anywhere near a goal (like me!).  However, when you do hit a goal, how do you plan on **rewarding yourself**?

Some guiding questions: do you reward yourself at all when you hit milestones or goals?  Do you do a few small rewards and then one large one when you hit something particularly important?  What types of rewards do you give yourself?  They can be money (setting aside money every time you go to the gym, a trip to the spa (massages feel awesome when you're sore), a vacation (small or large), a new toy, etc.  How do you determine if you've earned a reward or not?  Do you assign certain goals to certain awards?

I hope everyone has a wonderful day!

How are you guys doing on this fine Friday?  How has your break been going?  Are you ready for the next round to start?  If you haven't yet

What do you have planned for today?  What about this weekend?

I'm going to be super active the next week or so.  I have a workout planned for today and then tomorrow I head to Colorado.  I then spend a week skiing, and general fitness things.  It's going to be awesome, though, especially since I haven't skied in almost a decade.  My husband and I realized that the last time we both went skiing, neither of us had cell phones.

Being sick is the worst. I'm done complaining. But seriously this shit wont go away haha. While being sick can certainly interrupt your schedule the introduction of a woman into my life has certainly made things more interesting. Going and meeting friends and changing my general routine has made me take a second and remind me I need to plan for more nights out and that I really need to keep my diet on point when I am not trying to woo a pretty lady.

Another interesting point that occurred was she was legit concerned about me when she slowly started to realize how much I worked out. Up to ~14 hours a week when I do everything. While it was coming from a good place and I had explained before my unhealthy relationship with food she was worried that I had replaced food with exercise and it may still be unhealthy. 

So I present to you a few questions. How do you plan and prepare for the unexpected changes in your life. Do you skip out on the diet for a few days or maybe even have emergency plans and meals prepared or available? Also how do the people in your life react to the fact that you are trying to better yourself through healthy means? Do they worry

Anyways just a few things to think about today. So tell us about your day. Doing anything in the name of fitness? Let us know!",self,t5_2s0sd,False,,gold1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1aa47l/break_day_march_14th_2013/

As we draw nearer to the end of round 9

This could be exercise or diet.  Did you try lifting weights and discover that you just did not find it fun?  Did you try running and discover you hated it?  Did you try a diet and realize that you couldn't make it work?  What have you tried?

Knowing what you've tried and knowing what hasn't worked allows you to modify what you are doing in the future.  It enables you to move forward and not keep going in circles.  No one has success 100% of the time

Its nice to experience. The thing is though that I can't sit here and then not think about it becuase that also means I did what I needed to do this week and it worked. Now is the time to look back and reflact on what happened. What worked. What didnt. 

We always should be looking back onto our past successes and failures over the week. It really does help us to remember to work hard and do what needs to be done. If you make these mistakes and never fix them then your progress will be much slower. Each of you fortunately has the wherewithal and wisdom to seek support and a group of people to motivate you. Don't forget that!

It seems like quite of few of our runners here either have recently run races or are just about to - so today’s topic is **races**.  Do you have any races coming up?  If so, or just willy-nilly go out running whenever?  

I’d love to hear about your **goal pace for races** - how do you decide on it?  Some of us may base it off of our regular runs

Another important aspect of racing that I would love to hear about is your **race routine** - do you have one?!  A certain meal the night before and snack the morning of?  Are there specific things you make sure to pack with you?  Prep your clothes the night before

And finally, cool courses, whatever - anything that in your opinion was an awesome race for whatever reason, feel free to share :D

So, so I try to run in the day.  However, even in the daytime, the winter skies tend to make it hard to see... so how do you deal with **visibility - what gear do you usually use**?  I have a mesh fluorescent vest and I also have two little reflector things that are fluroescent pink and have red lights that blink.  However, I haven’t needed them yet because I don’t run at night and I’ve been wearing really bright zip-up jackets, so visibility hasn’t been too big of a problem. 

Another important aspect of safety while running is your location - **are you running in a populated area**?  I live in a pretty large city with a solid crime rate, part of this issue can be solved by **running with a buddy** - I feel a lot safer when I have a buddy with me.  If you run with earphones (or even without), please remember to **always be aware of your surroundings**!!!  I usually wear earphones, but I leave one out so I can hear if anyone approaches me... it’s also useful when a biker is coming past so I know to stay out of their way.  

Let’s hear from you - **how do you deal with the issue of safety**?  What do you wear to ensure visibility?  Do you take certain precautions to make sure you are safe

And as always

**Edit:**  Just remembered I saw [this video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOyZ98gdoQg) posted in r/running a bit ago... for **those of you who run in the evenings and at night**, folks :D

How was your week? What were your challenges and your successes? We're officially into the third week of 2013, and the Superbowl is coming up quickly (as well as Mardi Gras!). That's a lot of happenings in the world, so I want to know what's happening with you!

As students, we snack. If you're like me, you'd love to snack even more than you do. When I ask 90DGers what topics they want to cover in the student posts, snacks inevitably comes up several times. 

So let's talk about snacks. 

First of all, found, or bought? Are you snacking from boredom, hunger, or something else? What kind of snacks do you usually crave, and when do you crave them? 

Thinking about why you're snacking can help you determine what kind of snack to eat. If it's a small meal for you between classes, and find something new to do. If you're always craving certain types of treats, find a healthy snack that satisfies that taste, like yogurt or fruit for a sweet tooth, popcorn or roasted veggies for salty snack.

So what are you craving lately? When and why do you snack? I can tell you that, filling, healthy. Sometimes I'll have a sugarfree pudding cup or a Coke Zero to satisfy a sweet tooth, and I almost always carry an orange. 

Share your snack ideas! Maybe you'll get snacking inspiration from someone else! Now I kinda feel like having a little bite...

I'm sicker than a dog right now and while I desperately want to go to the gym

What do you do when confronted with illness?  Do you stay home and take it easy?  Do you still do some form of exercise?  Do you have varying levels of ""dealing with it"" based on how bad you're feeling?  If you do exercise, or do you do something different?

Of course

Do you change your *diet* at all?  Do you take time off from *exercising* until you’ve recovered, the flu, a sore throat, a massive headache?  Is there *anything else* you usually do when sick that seems to make you feel better?

Anyway

How do you keep track of yourself *during* the run?  Some people use GPS watches, which logs the total time, my average pace, and my mileage.  It also has the mile splits and you can see/log a few other things (type of surface, weather, etc.).  However, I’m considering getting a GPS watch soon

How do you keep track of everything *after* the run?  Spreadsheet?  Fitocracy?  Something else?  I log on Fitocracy, so I have a more solid storage space that is organized in a way that (I think) makes it easier for me to check my progress and history.  

Any other tracking-related things you’d like to share or questions you have?  For those of you who might be looking for something to use to track your runs, Nike+, MapMyRun... if anyone else has any to add, just post it in your comment and I’ll edit this main post to add it :D

I'm fairly new to running seriously - I've always run as a component of sports in high school

For me, and realized that running can be an enjoyable thing rather than an evil punishment threatened by sports coaches when you slack off during practice!

I continue running because I like to see what I am capable of as I keep pushing harder.  I tend to get competitive with myself, schoolwork, and thinking about grad school, I've had a ton on my mind lately, and it turns out that running helps me clear out my brain and think about other things for a bit!  I tend to throw on my earphones and just zone to the music, letting random thoughts wander about my brain.  Runs, and especially the long ones, which is a major issue for me as I try to work out what I want to do for grad school.

It's almost the holiday of Halloween, we experience scares that aren't so much fun...but they can prompt us to turn our lives around. Have you had a health scare that forced you to change something about yourself? Are you afraid or concerned about the effects some of your prior habits (or habits you're trying to change) will have on your body and your longevity?

I had emergency gallbladder surgery a little over two years ago, when I probably broke a bone in my foot but never went to a doctor about it (I KNOW, what a bonehead move). I credit that scare with putting me on the path that led me to join this community, to see my GP who put me on anxiety medication and the eating plan that led to my weight loss, and to seek treatment for my frozen shoulder (which restored total movement of that arm to me).

Life has been so busy lately, so I will have to take what little down time I am given until Thanksgiving.  That brings me to today's discussion: **do you keep exercising on vacation or do you take the time off?**

I always try to exercise on vacation but then I never actually do.  Usually I'm so fed up with the hotel exercise rooms that I don't bother going there.  However, with all the hiking, swimming, snorkeling, skiing, etc.  I never used to eat very healthy on vacations, but now I think I'm going to start doing that.  I started watching what I ate on my two most recent vacations and it went fairly well so I'll be doing that again.

What do you guys do?  Any tips or tricks?

My fitness pursuits have been going well. My knee is very function but not close to 100%. This is good because it allows me to baby it during workouts which is fine and it will not hurt any more the next day. I'm hoping to do a mud run in a few weeks so hopefully it will be fine by then. We will see!

What are you up to today? Anything interesting going on? I actually had a strange experience this weekend where because I look fit and was the best man at my friends wedding I was invited to go take a flying trapeze lesson. It was pretty wicked. That opportunity would have passed me if I didnt take care of myself. Just something neat to share. Have a great day everyone!

----------

**Sprint 1 Results**

How did your first sprint go? We talked about lifting programs, what worked, what didn't! 

**Sprint 2 Goals**

For sprint 2 - I'd encourage you to set goals not only inside the gym but outside the gym as well. For a week at a time, or trying out a new supplement. It doesn't need to be one of these 3, but for sprint 2, try to set yourself a goal in an area that's typically a weak spot for you. For me personally, I eat plenty of protein, but sleep is a big issue for me, so my Sprint 2 challenge is going to be getting 7 hours of a sleep a night for the entire sprint.

This week


Personally, from Williams-Sonoma. The books are divided into sections, depending on how long the recipes take to make (30 minutes start to finish, 15 minutes hands on, make more to store...), and they're the first place I go when meal planning for the week. There are lots of these types of cookbooks/recipes out there these days. Any suggestions for things to try? 

My favorites from these books include [fennel crusted pork tenderloin](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/fennel-crusted-pork-tenderloin.html) (weeknight, 30 min start to finish) and the [red pepper and goats cheese fritatta](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/red-pepper-and-goat-cheese-frittata.html?cm_src=RECIPESEARCH) (simple suppers, 30 min start to finish). Actually, after the first time we made that fritatta, they became one of our go-to recipes. They're great for clearing the fridge of any vegetables/cheese that needs to be cooked, and they're easy and quick to prepare. We have fritatta and salad at least once a week.


That segues neatly into our next topic. What are your go to recipes, the fritatta is always an option. I've always got some kind of cheese(goats, mozzarella, feta..), veggies(spinach, peas, tomatoes

Another go to for us is steak salad. Whenever steak goes on sale, soy sauce, ginger, sherry, sugar(we've been leaving this out lately because I'm ketoing) and some chili flakes), and then add the marinade to each portion of steak. These then go in the freezer, so when they are later defrosted

1346326579.0,z2meg,[Daily Goal] Day 18 - August 30,Gingryu,9,1,42,"Hello everyone!

After a long eventful weekend where my neighbors house caught on fire and had us evacuated for an undetermined amount of time I got to experience the kindness of other people. People are so willing to rally around someone in time of need. This isnt a bad thing just a new experience for me since I have always been highly self sufficient. 

My question for you is do you often get the chance to help others with their fitness? I like to think if someone was in a time of need where they needed to change their life around to a more active lifestyle I would be able to assist and would do so without thinking twice. On the other hand some people are ignorant to the basics of fitness and see my/our lifestyles as dangerous. Do you have to deal with these people often?

Ever since I started working out and aiming to get fit it has done more for me emotionally and personally than physically. This is just another reason why I feel working out is so important. Not super relevant to losing 5lbs before a beach weekend but I feel its important to note none the less.

So what are you doing today in the name of fitness? I actually got my boss to let me work the early shift so I could fit all of my errands and climbing training in today. Should be a good but long day. Let us know what you are up to!

It's the weekend!  It's also the end of the first week!  By now I'm sure you've been tested in your will power (I sure as heck was) and your dedication.  How did your week go?  What was the hardest thing to do?  Where did you slip up?  Where did you succeed?  Did you decide on how you are going to exercise?  How did that go?

How was yesterday?  What do you have planned for the weekend?

I won't lie to you - weekend are hard.  You're home and you're surrounded by all your food, and you might have a to-do list a mile long.  This brings us to today's topic: **dealing with cravings.**

I know we touched a little upon this when we talked about what we do in social situations

My goals were:

* Exercise - Start weightlifting again

* Weight - Get to my goal weight of 163 pounds

* Health - Get some cardio going on

And then...

* Exercise bork - My left shoulder went wonky; I went to physical therapy for frozen shoulder last year

* Health bork - I had a mystery ailment that lasted for a month when my boyfriend, and then I felt a pain in my abdomen. Immediately afterward, I was nauseated and dizzy with abdominal discomfort that just would not go away. A month of this shit! After a visit to the ER, my GP, and a gastroenterologist, the consensus is I probably tore some scar tissue in my abdomen from when I had gallbladder surgery two years ago. So my abdomen was irritated and painful, and I had a nice case of side effect IBS from that abdominal trauma. YAY. I had some other exploratory tests lined up this past week, and I am basically waiting to go out of state for the funeral and to spend a week with my family.

* Food bork - For a month

The ONLY good news is that my paleo-ish, which is good both ways, because I really can't afford to buy smaller pants just now, hehe. I love how I look and think I'm adorable; the weight loss is really apparent around my face, and I've lost my double chin almost completely.

What

Also

Since I reached my goal, if you're me, you're going to stuff a lot of them in your face. Tears make cookies taste better! Sniff.

My goals for the next round:

* Emotional unbork - Pull myself together and start eating ""normally"" again. No more cookies and club sandwiches because you're sad

* Weight nerf - New goal weight will be 145.

* Exercise hax - Now that my innards are kind of healed again

* Health buff - Reschedule at least the most important of the tests I'd scheduled to make sure I don't have a chest burster or [Kuato](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO1kKemcwYk) living in my abdomen. After I'm cleared,,False,self,t5_2s0sd,1344194954.0,,True

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last round we had public challenges which means that any other user on Fitocracy was able to join. We voted on that one and it was decided that this round the challenges stay private, which means a little bit more work for you, but I am sure it just requires a few minutes of your time to join. What now follows is a detailed description of steps necessary for you to join the challenges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group

5) After joining

Day #2 of the break. It has been a long week for me. My hard drive died last night with all of my resumes and job hunting stuff on it so I am dreading spending the time to try and get it all back. Oh well. Sometimes things just dont go as expected. 

This week has actually been a full week for me as I didnt miss any workouts. I am actually quite sore from Taekwondo also. How do you generally handle being sore? Is there anything you do to prevent it? Is there anything you do to recover from it?

Good luck with all of your goals today and let us know about anything else going on!

How did everyone do with their Sprint 2 goals?  Success?  Not-quite-success?  

I succeeded in one of my two Sprint 2 goals.  I've graduated from B210K!  I never thought I'd see the day when I could run an hour straight.

I did not succeed in my second goal, which is driving me nuts.

How about you?

Personally, and a new exercise regime. Not sure how well it will go as things are extremely stressful as I begin the separation process with my marriage. I'm trying to stay strong and not give in to emotional eating and apathy. I don't want to punish myself and it's what I usually do. Wish me luck.

For me, as did a few of my close friends.  When we'd play gigs, every bar was filled with smokers.  You couldn't avoid it.  I tried smoking a few times, and before you knew it, I was addicted.  I quit for a while after my first child was born, but then started up again, mostly due to social pressure.  Finally, I switched to the nicotine patch

Eating out is the downfall of so many diets! So what are we gonna do about it? We all know about trying to make healthy choices

Well! We research! Here's a few online resources to help aid you in making healthier choices when eating out...

* [The Fatbase](http://www.vancouversun.com/life/food/fatabase/lists.html)

* [Calorie Count Restaurant Database](http://caloriecount.about.com/fast-food-restaurants-mc3)

* [Fast Food Nutrition](http://www.fastfoodnutrition.org/)

* [Food Facts Search Engine](http://www.foodfacts.info/)

How was yesterday? Did you reach your goals? What are your goals for today?

Yesterday I got my workout done but diet is still off completely. I really can't seem to give a fuck about it because I don't have a plan to follow. I don't know if I want to do keto anymore since it's seriously a pain in the ass to cook separate meals for myself when I cook for my family. Still thinking on it.

**Today's topic is barbell lifts and workouts.**

As a reminder

In addition to the above

The barbell is very simple tool, but I was taught each one in about an hour’s time.

The weight is fixed and stable, you do not want the barbell to deviate at all, as this could result in immediate injury. This could also be seen as a disadvantage, because intelligent training should have components programmed in that will take the trainee outside the scope of their sport or activity – effectively training extreme ranges of motion as a safety-valve for when a movement does deviate from what is expected.

Another advantage of the barbell is that unlimited progression is possible because you can always add more weight to the bar. Of course, one could reach a point in their training where further progression is impossible. Being able to add more weight easily makes progressing with this tool very simple. - [Source](http://physicalliving.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-barbell-training-testing-the-tried-and-true-training-tool-for-strength-training/)

Why did I purchase these donuts? Because I was hungry. Who was I sharing them with? No one.

I am not quite sure what came over me to think that it was a good idea. We all fail from out diets and sometimes the things that we are embarrassed about are ones like these. Where we display our inner glutton and think this is who we actually are.

First things first

Have you failed in this process recently? I mean I did and I can laugh about it now because I forget how much of a weakness gas station stops and having spare cash can be for me. 

I recognize the issue. I determined the root cause. I found a way to fix it. I put the plan in motion. Fixing your diet is this simple process. Just repeatedly and often. 

Do good work today and remember you have all of the power in changing who you are and your relationship with food.

What else are you up to today in the name of fitness?

Go forth and be fit!

What I listed above is exactly why I made no progress this round. I know how to lose weight and I know how to structure my workouts but I never made a definitive plan. I never tracked it. I had no accountability because I stopped participating in the daily goal posts. These are all things I did when I made the most success towards my goals. They kept me focused. It wasnt easy at first but when it became routine I had a much better sense and feel on how I was doing and it felt great.

I realize now that these are the things I need to incorporate back into my life to make more progress. So over the next two weeks really take a look at yourself. Habits, and successes and make a solid plan on how to take it to the next level.

Personally

Successes: I am very good at managing my weight. I haven’t gained a thing in a while. I eat healthy and make up for it when I don’t by eating less or healthier the next day. Once I hit my goal weight I could maintain it without any issues.

Failures: I have become a sucker for snacks. I know for a fact this is why I haven’t lost weight. Nothing else about my diet has changed. Complacency has set in where I am so happy with my results but when it comes to a little dedication and focus to drop that last bit who needs it? I need it because that is the goal I set and I will achieve it. I have to believe that.

What to do from here: I need to plan my meals to avoid snacking

We mods work to help you have the resources and tools to help yourselves achieve your goals whatever they may be. So take the next two weeks and look into what you can do to improve your progress and make yourself a better person. So what are you doing to prepare for the next round? Have any questions?

You can rebuild yourself. We have the technology.

I plan on making up my goals for the next round today. If anyone is interested I could put them in another post and talk about them.

R6 Starting stats - 1/9/2012:

* 27 years old
* 5' 8.5"" tall
* 153.0 lbs
* 31.0% body fat according to scale
* 28.2% body fat according to tape measure method
* 28.5"" waist
* 40.0"" hips
* [Progress pics from the end of R3](http://i.imgur.com/rSPGY.jpg)

R6 Final stats - 4/7/2012:

* 144.2 lbs *(-8.8 lbs)* (and a [weight plot since R1](http://i.imgur.com/IkbYC.png))
* 28.1% body fat according to scale *(-2.5%)*
* 25.0% body fat according to tape measure method *(-3.2%)*
* 27.5"" waist *(-1.0"")*
* 38.5"" hips *(-1.5"")*
* [Progress pics from the end of R6](http://imgur.com/a/Zonjd) (I need to put these in the same format so it's easier to compare

Method:

* I set a small calorie deficit (1650 for most of the round, steady diet for the past few rounds. During the week, my meals are usually pretty repetitive. Breakfast: massive egg/egg white/veggie/cheese scramble. Morning snack: coffee and fruit. Lunch: giant spinach salad with cottage cheese, hard boiled egg, sunflower seeds, and cranberries. Afternoon snack: coffee and yogurt. Dinner: varies pretty widely, but usually falls around 400-500 cal range and includes &gt;15 g protein if possible. The weekends are less routine, I think I did a pretty good job avoiding binging.

* I ran C25K very regularly in the beginning of the round

* A one-on-one biggest loser competition helped me a ton. I had [this](http://i.imgur.com/OneAXl.jpg) message posted by my fridge the whole round. It worked pretty well in the beginning

Some setbacks:

* I injured my shoulder in R5 and it's still not completely back to normal. There's still some minor pain, I need to figure out something else to keep active.

* I lost my jump drive, body measurement, and jogging data going back to R1. That put a damper in my motivation for a while, not being able to see my stats. I have all my paper records, but yeesh, I don't wanna type it all up again. So I'm starting fresh next round and I'm relying on LiveStrong plots until then.

* Barely any holiday setbacks this time. Valentine's and Easter and a couple birthdays

* Biggest setback this round was probably my laziness kicking back in. I barely went to the gym at all

Some successes:

* Completely reached my weight goal! I barely set any other goals for Round 6, so I'm gonna count it as a success.

* I signed up for my first 5K, but it feels good to be running again at least.

Overall, but it's late and I need to get some sleep so I can wake up early and run... :/",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,True,self1,

I'm almost recovered from my surgery and infections and I'm back on my keto diet as well as going to the gym. Baby steps on the gym because my energy is low and jumping is difficult. It will come though.

In the next few days we will be having a lot of posts. Results

As for me, which is pretty awesome I thing. After being injured so much getting progress again certainly feels awesome. Now with trying to lose weight, the heave lifts are still suffering (deadlifts, oooooh deadlifts) and I am still plateau-ing but well, forward I guess. After writing the Fitocracy charts I feel a bit more motivation, but still feel a bit low when thinking of my private live.

Let's talk vegetarianism / veganism! 

I know there are vegetarian subreddits, ways to do this, weird things and prejudices that cross your path, anything. Or just vent about silly people trying to make you eat meat!

I'll kick off with all of that ;)

I never really liked the taste of most meat

As a young teen I went completely vegetarian

That resulted in a cranky boyfriend

In 2008 I dated a guy who would purr ""ooh yum steak"" every time we'd drive by a field with cows. Sigh. He was super pissed off when I didn't want to eat his 'world famous pork'. ""oh come on

But it made me even stronger in me staying vegetarian. It also strengthened my empathy for the animals kept in the bio-industry; my main reason not to eat them. I don't want to have anything to do with this exploitation. I really have a problem with people looking at animals as a product. So

Luckily my family and current boyfriend are totally supportive,,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,True

I want to thank each and every one of you for checking in to yesterday's dailygoal. I **know** that listing things out like that can be very unpleasant. I am a firm believer in seeing things in print when it comes to obstacles and goals, which is what we're going to try to do today.

* **Injuries:** Sometimes our bodies just can't do what we want them to, or we can find out what we **can** do, and strive to do it. I know it's not easy. I was personally paralyzed in a bad car accident 10 years ago and I was told I would never walk again. I didn't accept that so I did everything I could to work on what was in my control. I'm not saying all injuries can be overcome, but we certainly don't have to be defined by them!

* **Low self-esteem:** This is a very common issue, I am still battling their influences via therapy. It's not easy and I won't ever try to say there's an easy fix for emotional issues like self-esteem. What I can tell you is that **YOU** have the power to change things. We at 90DaysGoal are here for each and every one of you, all you need to do is reach out and someone will reach back. *I PROMISE*

* **Stress:** We've all got stress! Some have more than others, when it comes to fitness), or make us curl up into the fetal position around a bag of Doritos. But, there are so many tools at our disposal for dealing with stress that we often overlook them because we're too deep in our own situations. Yoga, meditation, reading, drawing, therapy, talking a nap, or have our toddlers suddenly stop being assholes

* **Laziness/Procrastination:** I am the QUEEN of procrastination and a super lazy person. I wasn't raised like this, as does havingg a schedule and routine set out. I never stick to it for long though because I seriously am Sofa King lazy. Any suggestions for me and the others who need them?

* **Depression &amp; Grief:** This is a big one for me. When I lost my little brother 7 years ago, and I just fell apart. To have the boy I raised die in my arms was just so much more than I could bear. Add on another 6 people dying in the last 7 years and I was a mess. When I had my daughter, I was so stressed from lack of sleep and so paranoid she would die, I went nuts. Thankfully I have a very supportive (step)family, a wonderful husband, and an amazing doctor. I am now on anti-depressants and no longer suicidal. I've been through a bunch of therapy and grief counseling and I feel I am making progress. I no longer cry every day and things don't seems as bleak. My point is these things are serious and sometimes, we can't help ourselves. Turn to others when you're grieving, but there are many signs that things aren't right. I had post-partum depression on top of everything and I didn't realize it until it was almost too late (homicidal/suicidal urges). I urge you all to talk to a counselor, in needing help. Sometimes, am here for each and every one of you if you need to talk

* **Going it alone:** Some of you are doing this without support in real life. I am sad that you don't have the support in person, a fellow gym goer or a trainer glanced in your direction and thought ""good for them!"". And, as always, we here at 90DaysGoal are here for you!

Those are just some of the many obstacles we face. I want to see you all go back to the yesterday's post and reach out to those facing the same obstacles as you

Personally

Have a great day everyone and I'll be back later to respond to each and every one of you. That's my commitment to you here in Round 6. No comment will be left unacknowledged! &lt;3

My [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kr92d/intro_this_is_the_perfect_supplement_to_starting/
) was pretty lengthy

First off

Hit some pretty big bumps in the road in terms of stress/personal life.  My 3 year old was diagnosed on the Autism spectrum.  There's a lot more I could say about this, is even moreso now.  I also surprised myself to find that I was actually CRAVING exercise as a way to blow off steam/reduce stress, in that I've always heard of people getting to that point, but had never before gotten there myself.

I am still using a completely unrestricted diet (calorie deficit, so I do tend to avoid them more than I used to.  But not completely =).  I still absolutely believe in moderation; I've eaten just about every ""bad"" diet item under the sun and done JUST fine.  I also had a 2% or whole milk flavored latte just about every damn day (my vice).

Still using numbers as my big motivator.  [Myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/karebearwsu), as well as my Excel spreadsheets (although I stopped tracking nutrition and only log measurements and exercise).

I saw the scale do a lot of interesting things over the last few months.  Definitely got more frustrated than I wanted to at times

Here's the comparison of stats from starting (plain text) and *ending (italics)*.

**Starting Stats:**

Height: 5' 6""

Weight: 223 lbs / *196.2 lbs*

**Measurements:**

* Bicep: 15.5"" / *14.5""*
* Waist: 43.5"" / *38""*
* Hips: 49"" / *45""*
* Thigh: 30.5"" / *28""*

**Fitness plan:**

* 40min Treadmill 4x per week / *45 - 75 minutes Treadmill 3x per week*
* Informally, walking to the park, etc).  I already do this most days. / *Still walking most days, I do NOT count this as exercise (in MyFitnessPal)*
* Eventually add strength training, situps, etc on a casual basis. *Still haven't worked on this much.  I tried Pilates and hated it.  I am investing in a set of KettleBells next week.*

**Current Workout Progress:**

* Most recent [(September 24th, with the longest stretch being 6 minutes of running. *Most recent [(December 27th, 2011)](http://www.running-log.com/workouts/1243986?athleteid=17458) run was 6 miles nonstop at 5.7 mph pace, with a 5 minute warmup and cooldown at 3.2mph.*
* I have walked somewhere (including a 2 hour trail hike) every day this week, but I manage to stay busy.*

**Diet Plan:**

* Breakfast of non-wheat carbs (oatmeal, on workout days I ""treat"" myself to a latte vs. drip coffee w/ cream on other days) / *Nope, latte is pretty much every day without fail.  I often eat 300-600 calories in just food, but I adjust later in the day.*
* Small Lunch of a sandwich or soup (300-400 cal) / *Generally still true.*
* Snack of Veggies/Protein (like hummus &amp; celery or almonds) (150-200cal) / *I tend to skip a snack in lieu of a beer before bed.  I'm not kidding
* Dinner as my ""flex meal"" (i.e. might be a treat if I did well the rest of the day

**Goals:**

* 199 lbs (just want to break below 200!) / *ACHIEVED! 196.2 lbs*
* Get to a pace and interval series where I can do a total of 3 miles of running in any one workout / *ACHIEVED! Longest nonstop distance is at SIX miles*
* run a 10 minute mile / *ACHIEVED!  Fastest mile is about 9:50,,False,self,t5_2s0sd,True,,True

As for me, but I still had the run, felt great. Laura is a bit sick again, this really does not seem to stop. Not much sleep yesterday as she has a bit of a fever but surprisingly today seems to go better we will see how this night goes. My wife had a bit of a breakdown when she found out that the hair-butcher toned her hair blue (instead of black) which you can see while looking closely at her hairline. Blue, I kid you not. She is a bit annoyed but I must admit I find it more cute than anything. Eating for my is where I am a bit cheating right now....well it is the holidays at all, so, I am not too mad about this.

Woah....success and failure, no leg pain, but a bit limited. Did the run with my wife (c25k w1 d1) and she is certainly not there yet. Worse there was so much complaining, I wonder if she will keep at it. Oh my. I might have mentioned somewhere down the line that I was maybe earning some money with doing a website for a company. Now maybe half a year later I am getting a response, and despite getting feedback about the design I did, I got the framed design of another webdesigner. Not even sure I want to call them again, as it seems to be a ""copy their design but do it cheaper"" sort of contract work. Not as I have any free time at all. Ah well.

And Feck is back. So how are you guys doing?

For me it is an up &amp; down, but still today workout was more than good, really doing progress. I plan to start c25k this time with my wife as it seems my leg is slowly healing. We were at the doctor recently and I will get some physical therapy. Laura is doing better, well as it turns out her parents bad genes are showing. Some imbalances in her feet maybe from her fathers side and maybe some asthma from her mothers side. Could still grow out but we will see. Laura is always a bit behind but now we found one thing where she is trailing, which is puzzles. It is amazing and kind of strange to watch her systematically solve one of those. Pretty cool. As things turned out well with my car (sold it for an okay price, lost the papers twice but got them back in time, the oil leak damage was no biggie (as it could have been) at all) and presents are all set, oh yeah due to the drinking of course not pregnant yet,False,

1318950782.0,lgca6,[Runners] Topic: Running Shoes,Mr_Nox,10,1,11,"This week's topic is running shoes - the various types of shoes

**Running Mechanics**

When you run, and you roll your foot to the side.  The muscles in the foot stiffen, creating a springboard to propel your next step.  Many runners tend to roll their feet too far to either side, experiencing either *overpronation* when the foot rotates too far to the inside, or *supination* (also called *underprontation*) when the foot rolls to the outside.  Each of these issues can result in injuries, but can be corrected via the proper type of running shoe.

[Pronation diagram](http://imgur.com/fYQex)

**Correcting Pronation via Traditional Running Shoes**

Today's modern running shoe was invented by Nike in the early 1970s.  Until then

Overpronators

Underpronators, and/or very flexible shoe.

**Types of Traditional Running Shoes**

Traditional running shoes tend to fall into three categories:

* *Cushioning* - generally used by mild over- and underpronators
* *Stability* - used by neutral runners and mild to moderate overpronators.  The shoes reduce the amount of inward roll of the foot.
* *Motion Control* - for moderate to severe overpronators.  They have stiffer heels and are specifically designed to help drastically reduce overpronation.

**Barefoot and Minimalist Running Shoes**

Pre-1970s running shoes offered very little support and thin soles.  You felt the road/track/trail with every step, professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University, ""A lot of foot and knee injuries currently plaguing us are caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet weak, cause us to over-pronate (ankle rotation) and give us knee problems"".  The number of blown Achilles tendons has increased 10%, and cases of plantar fasciitis have dramatically increased.

The barefoot running movement is a reaction to the modern running shoe, the minimalist shoe was created to get runners as close to barefoot as possible, while still protecting feet from road debris.  The most recommended minimalist shoe on Reddit is the [Vibram FiveFingers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibram_Five_Fingers) (or VFF for short).  The shoe was originally design as a boat shoe, but over time has become a popular shoe for running.  Other popular brands of minimalist running shoes are the [Nike Free Run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Free) and [Saucony Kinvera](http://www.saucony.com/store/SiteController/saucony/staticpage?CID=Print-Kinvara&amp;content=Kinvara_saucony).

I'm stuck in a plateau which is really discouraging.  I've felt great about my body and what it can do, which I really don't want to do because it's so unhelpful.  At the same time, I wonder whether losing more weight will actually make me happier, although I'm generally a happy and optimistic person anyway?

I haven't been bothered with quality of calories so much, but I tend to eat high protein and veg in the day and a carb-heavy meal at night.  Do you guys think I should stop eating exercise calories or eating carbs at night for a few days, to get things going again?  But the proviso to that is that I typically burn 400-800 calories every day, and I don't want to fall under the minimum line...

This has totally fucked up my mood and my day. I have no idea where I started and so I don't know what progress I made this week, and one of them is knowing exactly how much I weigh. 

I'm going to try not to let it disrupt or discourage me too much -- yesterday I tried on and bought some jeans in a size 14 (10 in the US) that fit me, as well as being worried that I'm going to end up punishing myself via minimal calories this week instead of doing things healthily. I'm worried that I might not be able to control the pyschological impulses left over from before.

It is almost time for our first weight-in so I wanted to post some information to get people started on biking who may have never done it before. I
__________________________________________________________
**If you want to be successful biking there are several things you must keep in mind:**

**1. Know your goals.**

**2. Success is made in the kitchen

**3. Find a routine to help you reach your goals.**

**4. Cycling is not the end-all
________________________________________________
**Know your Goals**
________________________________________________
There is a saying I heard once: 
&gt; ""An archer cannot hit the bullseye if he doesn’t know where the target is.""

I want you all to think about that quote for a moment. We all came to this subreddit because we have goals we want to achieve. We may take different paths to our final destination but we're all moving forward; some of us on bikes. First and foremost I hope you have some written representation of your overall goals; short term and long term because it will help you discover what you're trying to get out of bicycling. 

Some questions to ponder:

* Do you want to lose weight?
* Do you want to increase cardiovascular heath?
* Is your final goal to be in competitive racing or leisure rides?
* Do you prefer stationary or regular biking?
* Do you value distance ridden over intensity of the ride?

All of these things may lead you to different forms and plans in regards to biking depending on your answer. We'll get more into that later but take some time to consider your end-game. 

________________________________________________
**Success is made in the kitchen
________________________________________________
Cycling is a great

Even if your goal isn't to lose weight you, carbohydrates and fats seem to be valued among the biking community and you need to keep a proper hydration and electrolyte level at all times. To inquire about specific dietary plans please feel free to contact our fellow brothers and sisters in the /r/loseit, /r/bicycling, and /r/fitness communities! they are very friendly and willing to help out.

So remember; don't go for a ride without diet applied. Figure out what's best for you and use your diet as a tool to accopany your biking to lead you to your goals. They are all interconnected. 
________________________________________________
**Find a routine to help you reach your goals.**
________________________________________________

There aren't very many definitive routines for bikers nor is there really a *best* routine. Here are a couple examples to options available for bikers depending on goal.

* [HIIT](http://evilcyber.com/fitness/primer-hiit-high-intensity-interval-training/) (High Intensity Interval Training)(Is usually used for running but [can be adapted to cycling](http://www.active.com/triathlon/Articles/How-to-Create-Your-Own-Interval-Workouts.htm)) - Fat loss
* [Tabatta method](http://www.active.com/triathlon/Articles/Go-for-Broke-with-Tabata-Intervals.htm) (Similar to HIIT) - Fat loss
* [Higher resistance biking](http://www.trinewbies.com/tno_cycling/tno_cyclearticle_07.asp) - Building some strength/toning muscles
* Liesure riding - Increase cardiovascular health/fat loss/keep your sane
* [High mileage biking](http://www.training4cyclists.com/12-hours-pr-week-training-program/) - Build endurance/travel/competition cycling

Keep in mind though that even if you're the most hardcore Olympic triathlete; biking is supposed to be fun and leisurely try not to forget that and don't be afraid of mixing up some different styles and routines to keep things fresh and challenging.
___________________________________________________
**Cycling is not the end-all
___________________________________________________
If your end goal is to lose weight I have some heart breaking news. Biking alone will not get you there. Simply put
__________________________________________________

I hope this information has been helpful to get you started on examining what you want to get out of biking and how to get started. Regardless if you're sporting stationary bike or a top of the line road bike, plan plan.

2. **steviewonderwoman**, but I'm wondering how y'all are doing!?  On the topic of drinking on keto, I am actually planning to focus on socializing while on keto and paleo (in a few weeks), so we'll definitely return to that issue again.     

3. **tehmagwi**, and I were all going to work on menu cheat sheets so that when we go out to dinner we're armed with a list of 'acceptable' keto &amp; paleo menu options and are less likely to stray from the diet/don't need to sit there for hours poring over the menu.    

4. **akatch** and **itsreallyme** were going to do some pantry re-orgs so that it was easier to see all their food options.  I'm thinking I need to do the same to my pantry over the weekend to make snack foods more obvious/accessible!    

5. **simplyput** and **SirJohnEh** were going to tweak their diets a bit.  Simplyput was going to pay more attention to calories and macroratios; SirJohnEh got some slightly troubling bloodwork back after a few weeks on keto

A standard can of light tuna in water, and there is no carbohydrate or fiber.  You get some omega-3 lipids but not nearly what you would from salmon; and if you're into that you might want to get albacore which has a bit more.  Sodium is there, 558 in a can, but you get some other minerals too like potassium 391, magnesium 45,  selenium 133.    But for those of you who like to eat the same thing all the time,  you can't just eat tuna every day

I'm not crazy about fresh tuna as an entree

Back to the canned stuff:  here's a few ideas.  One, eat with a fork, hopefully with some veggies or salad on the side. 
As for classic tuna salad: there are many variations on tuna salad, and adds chopped green apple, unpeeled, or any kind of apple works.

To store tuna salad: pack it in the container so there are no air pockets

Today is my back / triceps routine and hopefully some time to get back somef sleep. Also trying to install a door today. We will see how that goes.

For those of who not familiar with them, and very quick.  I used to pig out on fries and spicy mayonnaise

So I went and got my usual - half a chicken, I'm good enough to avoid the free refills on soda!  I'm feeling very hungry though as it was an early start and a late lunch, so I decide to get an appetizer as well.  The houmous with chilli oil and pitta bread looks good, so I get that.  It arrives, it's a fair lump of houmous (an icecream scoop, it looks like!) and maybe 1.5, 2 pitta breads sliced.  I eat most of it, the chicken and sides arrive

So the chicken, 50g protein, 15g fat (yeah I ate the skin), 3.2 carbs.  All good.

The rice is pretty good too, 5f, 34c.  Well it is rice, it's going to be a bit carby.

The corn on the cob, 5p, 3.5f, 25.5carb.

So in total, 23.5g fat, 63g carbs.  For eating out, that's not too bad, and usually fills me up.

Oh, could it?  Let me illustrate using a well known meme.

fross: What does the menu say about its calorie level?

menu: it's over NINE HUNDREEEEEEEED!!!

fross: Over nine hundred?!?  That's impossible!

That little sodding plate of homous, but 32 of fat and 120 of carbs!  I could almost cry.  That's more than the whole rest of the meal combined!

So BE CAREFUL, and those calories add up FAST.  Get a non-creamy soup or a salad with the dressing on the side.  Stick to your main courses, and be healthy!

I want to get a great bikini figure. Over the past 2 years i gained 8 kg of fat. I know that 68 kg by 1.72 m is normal weight but being a fit 25 year old and having a healthy bodyfat index is differnt.

My plan is to produce a calorie deficit of &gt; 600 kcal per day. My basic needs for my body are 1900 kcal of food which i will reduce to around 1400 - 1500 kcal of food per day. Due 3 x exercise in the gym (1 h) and 2 x swimming (45 min) i will save ca. 2000 kcal calories per week.
This leaves me with an average of a 5000 kcal saved per week. That means i need around 90 days to lose those 8 kg fat (aquivilant of 60

What do you think about my dieting plan? Do you think my plan is doable? Should I set a lower goal maybe of 6 kg in 90 days? I have no idea how my body will react

1290173010.0,e8mry,[90dg] DAY 5 - “It’s Friday! Can’t I be a little bad this weekend?”,katiekatums,9,1,10,"Yes! Sort of... You’re making changes for life

**Foodsies**

You can be a little loose and free on the weekends, this was a real eye-opener. Between fast food, restaurants, and snacking, I found out that the “little” splurges that I made on the weekends pushed me up to 4000+ calories per day for Friday, Saturday, *and* Sunday. Those splurges wiped out any deficits I had built up over the week. Once you have an idea how you’re spending your calories on the weekends, just try to eat them in moderation. (Those cheesy buttery biscuits at Red Lobster

Keep an eye on your weekly calorie totals. (If you use livestrong, then you have some breather room for the weekends. For instance, if you were 100 cals under your goal each day for five days, you can make the choice between 1) going over by 500 calories on Friday, Saturday, **or** Sunday, or 2) making some extra progress toward your goal.

If you decide to indulge on the weekends, just be mindful of the calories and keep your goals at the front of your mind.

Alcohol! Who doesn’t like to drink on the weekends? You don’t have to give it up, and be prepared to see your weight loss slow a bit by Monday. Again, I think the key here is moderation. Since you’re trying to make yourself healthier, you might want to consider scaling back on drinking anyway, but that’s a personal choice. :)

**Activity**

You should have at least one rest day built into your weekly routine. If you work out every day, even if it’s as simple as walking a bit faster around a mall or taking a walk through the park. If you’re more ambitious, go for a hike or a row or  play some sports with your friends. Any bit of activity on your rest day is better than no activity at all. Don’t feel obligated to go to the gym though.

**Weekends at 90dg**

Over the weekends

There won’t be a daily reading material post on Saturday or Sunday (unless someone else wants to post one - too much typing to do one from my phone). But we’ll come back full force on Monday with our first weekly check-in. If you don’t already have one

As with all the reading material posts, corrections, and additions! Good luck to everyone this weekend!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e8mry/90dg_day_5_its_friday_cant_i_be_a_little_bad_this/

1.) It is about time we name new moderators and get them in the list on the right. Personally I would say baiser and/or katiekatums are the most active people here. So if they would do it

2.) November the 6th will be the official last day of round 1. We should all discuss when and how we proceed with the second round. My suggestion in that order:

- Celebration (or deep depression)

- Advertise the shit out of this subreddit for a few days (07-10th November)

- **Everyone** starts threads about their experience (nutrition, helping the newbies to chime in and to set their goals (10-14th November)

- Round 2 starts Monday the 15th November

- (no reason to stop training during introduction week)

Agree? Disagree? I stated in the first post to have a 2 week hiatus

3.) We could use a good text / or faq to advertise. We need a volunteer to write one. Anyone here willing to prepare something like this?

4.) One good idea from the previous post was to use [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/groups/) to create a 90daysgoal group. That way we can have a similar goal we were working on as it supports group stats

5.) To advertise better we could compile a group statistic to say something akin to ""We lost 100 pound in total in round one

6.) Places to advertise in:

- r/fitness

- r/fittitbuddy

- r/IWantToLearn

- r/looseit

- r/twoxchromosomes

- Original 90 days reddit

- 90days Iama (is this a good idea?)
