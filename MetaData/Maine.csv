I normally get downvoted to hell in this sub

(I know for a fact it's a generic automated response from the broken script that appeared instead of her signature.  In the real email the ""A"" is 3 times bigger than the font size from the rest of the message

_________________________

Thank you for contacting me about the National Security Agency's (NSA) information collection programs.  I appreciate your taking the time to do so.

I have noted your concern that the NSA programs recently divulged by Edward Snowden may have violated the privacy and civil liberties of la w-abiding American citizens.  I am a strong supporter of privacy and civil liberties, by the courts, and by the people.

 

It is important to note that many of Mr. Snowden's assertions about NSA's information collection activities are  simply  false .     During a recent Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on  cybersecurity , about Mr. Snowden's claims that he could tap into virtually any Americ an's phone calls or e-mails.  General Alexander testified that those  claims were absolutely false.  

 

Throughout the world , Congress recognized that our laws had not kept pace with the advances of technology, and that terrorists were able to use our laws against us.  To address these crucial issues, changes were made in  our laws.  These changes require con stant review and oversight.  A t my insistence , and that of many of my colleagues,  these laws   also include sunset provision s so that Congress must periodically reexamine them .

 

When former Senator Joe Lieberman and I drafted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004

 

Judicial scrutiny, no federal agency can listen in on the content of a domestic phone call without a  court-issued  warrant based upon probable cause.  In addition, federal law prevents the NSA – or any other agency – from indiscriminately sifting through phone records.   With th e approval of the FISA court ,   t he database for the NSA program  consists of a collection of telephone numbers, times, and the duration of calls , but  not the content of the calls .  The collection of this  database is approved by the FISA court ,"" which is a telephone number associated with a suspected foreign terrorist.

 

The other NSA program, the program cannot be used to target an individual reasonably believed to be an American or someone who is located in the United States.  

 
According to  the Obama administration and  General Alexander, there remain ques tions and issues we must address.  I have strongly encouraged the Administration to reveal more information about these programs, including identifying actual plots that have been prevented because of th e existence of these programs.

 
As a Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee

 
Please be assured that I will continue  vigorous  oversight of the intelligence community's activities

 

Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue. EMAIL.BEGINHIDE.MERGE

 

Sincerely

A 

Susan M. Collins

United States Senator

I'm open to it existing
#1 (anecdotal evidence): I've never met anyone from Maine. Everyone I've met that says they've been to Maine was either a) a child with an unreliable memory or b) a heavy substance abuser with an unreliable memory. 
#2 (case study): Many cultural exports from ""Maine"", doesn't pass Occam's Razor, but just the same, there's not enough evidence one way or the other. 
#3 (qualitative survey): I've spent years touring all over the United States
#4: (the strongest point): Maine is the magical fairy tale land of excellent writers such as Stephen King and John Irving. The land of the Mist. The land of Pennywise. The land of Twisted River and Garp. A story land fabrication that has taken its place permanently among the collective conscience. 

And so I rest my case. I offer the floor to my awaiting opposition,,False,self,t5_2qts0,False,,True

**Who can attend?** This is an 18+ event. Under 21 will not be permitted to drink. This is on NinjaSupplyCompanys personal property so I am making rules to protect him from any repercussions and because it's the law. 

**What will we be doing??** Depending on how many people confirm - we can discuss having a cookout and a keg. If you're willing to bring something post here and let me know so I can make sure we have enough food and drinks for everyone.

**Where?** Off route 1 in Waldoboro (will post a reminder the week before and will pm people who want to attend the address)

**Why come to this event?** *Obligatory* Because fuck you that's why!  But really


We look forward to meeting some new people and having a kick ass weekend.

If you live in the RSU 19 district, there has been a hold on ALL spending. That means no classroom supplies, no books, no field trips, no extracurricular activities, no afterschool support programs--unless funded by an outside donor. During the informational meetings to discuss the reasons for the financial issues as well as possible resolutions, teachers have taken a verbal beating. When this is coupled with the attacks from our Governor on the profession

The day before vacation began, with a little girl who was quite struck with all that I was purchasing. ""That woman has a lot of applesauce, Momma!"" she commented. I heard the mom explain to her little girl that some children didn't have enough to eat.

As I unloaded my purchases in the parking lot, this woman had purchased a gift card and left it there for me. On the envelope, she had written, ""Thanks for all you do!"" 

I work with high school students, we are all demoralized.

The day this mother stood behind me in line at Hannaford's, for remaining proud to be Nokomis Warriors. She told them how much she appreciated the teachers in the building, who continued to shield them from as much of the problem as possible in order to provide them with the opportunities that only an education can bring. Immediately, there was a smattering of applause, which swelled across the gym as our students stood and clapped for nearly five minutes in appreciation for their teachers. There were many of us--and many students--whose eyes were far from dry. I will never forget those moments.

And for this stranger to recognize and value the contributions that teachers make to the lives of our students was the ""cherry on top."" When I walked back into the store

I told the story of the young mother's gift in the teachers' room the next morning

**tl/dr;**

Disabled Hermon resident desperately needs to borrow **dehumidifiers**.

Also needs the name of the best building/construction law/contracts **lawyer** in Maine. (Not too far from Hermon/Bangor area would be a best.)

---------------------------------------------------------------

My friend Jeremy is a fantastic, driven, funny guy. He works helping other people with spinal cord injuries and other mobility issues. I drive for him and help in other small ways. He's a quadriplegic, paralyzed since age 15, and he depends on an accessible environment. He recently met the love of his life, and in March, a home builder finished their new house. They moved in in April. This was life-changing for Jeremy--a flat floor that lets him get everywhere, appliances

Now the problem: The builder *royally* screwed up in a few critical ways. (I can explain how, ceilings, and insulation are pouring wet. The heating was also installed improperly, and they're facing the possibility that the house may be uninhabitable come winter.

Yes

 * They need to borrow dehumidifiers. Preferably big ones with a drain hose, which none of us can afford. I can schedule pick-ups Jeremy's van, and will return units when you need them back.

 * They need a *really* good lawyer who specializes in homeowner/builder contract disputes. They need to avoid some truly terrible potential outcomes

If you want to determine that this isn't some ridiculous, as long as it can't interfere with forthcoming legal undertakings.

Thanks for reading.

So I pedal my white ass the good mile or so to Tim Hortons, so I do the ""good guy bicyclist"" thing and turn up on the sidewalk to let him by (which, according to the [Maine DOT site](http://www.maine.gov/mdot/bikeped/safety/laws.shtml) is legal, and Brewer's City Ordinance has no mention of it being illegal from what I read).


So naturally the guy turns on his lights, sipping on my delicious coffee, he lets me go.

I already told him I'm not playing ""Psycho Roommate Roulette"" and I'm not living in the Drug Den Arms Slum Apartments

Basicly I need to know what the cost of living is for a single male aged 28 in Auburn

Rent  ---   The place I'll be working at is just off Hotel road he said.
Phone  ---  Never had a cell phone before but will need one for work
Internet  --- gonna need it
Power  ---  I'm probably going to be running at least 1 computer 16+ hours a day
Heat  ---  Most big apartment buildings (I'm told) have shared heat so this may not be an issue.
TV  ---  I can live without it
Food  ---  This probably wouldn't change much though

I only ask because my ability to run a google search has apparently died lately I can't find anything more recent then 2010
