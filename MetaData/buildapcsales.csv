1376437155.0,1kbanf,[Rant] Enough is enough. This irrational hatred of Newegg needs to stop. Amazon is great. Newegg is great.,okp11,359,182,173,"Let me start off by saying this post is long overdue. Pretty much every Newegg ad/flier that gets posted here the top comment goes along the lines of ""ZOMG Y U NO GIVE ME MORE SAILS NEWEGG"". This is proceeded by people circlejerking Amazon and complaining about Newegg. [It was just painful seeing the amount of misinformation going through this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1k9ufo/newegg_diy_done_right/).

Before people get the idea that I am some Newegg fanboy

**The way you people should be making your purchases should be based off of the price**. Let me reiterate

**1**. Newegg promotions pretty much always have at least a few sales worth posting here. Its blatantly obvious that the people who are saying this haven't looked through the ad or don't know enough about prices to distinguish what is a sale and what isn't. More importantly, never puts out any sales ads that are worth posting here**. Its extremely hypocritical to complain about one site's ads when the site you are lauding(Amazon) doesn't put out any at all.

**2.** I keep hearing people belittle the prices of Newegg. [**If you haven't seen it, but they usually don't beat it.

**3.** Stop making irrational complaints about Newegg's customer service. Newegg's customer service is phenomenal. If you have ever been on their live chat or talked on the phone to one of their representatives you know that they do everything in their power to help you. **Both Amazon and Newegg have outstanding customer service**. One is certainly not blatantly better than the other. The two sites return policies are also a lot more similar than they are different. People keep saying Amazon has a no questions asked return policy. This is not true. I have talked to people who have had their returns rejected because or the same type of thing as Newegg. The most common reason: physical damage. In both cases the retailers find that you have to go through the manufacturer, and GamingPC of people who supposedly got screwed over with a return to Newegg. That's not an alarming rate.


**4.** I see people saying that Prime makes Amazon the better place to purchase from. I have subscriptions to both Prime and Shoprunner. The difference between the two? I've had shoprunner for **FREE** for 2 years and it won't expire until December 2014. Both have the same selling point; you get free two day shipping. One isn't inherently better than the other. I saw an extremely stupid comment on the Newegg ad posted today saying that the shipping was much better from Amazon. Whether you are using Amazon or Newegg

_________________________________________

**TL;DR** stop perpetuating this anti-Newegg circle jerk. This is not a post bashing Amazon. This is just a wake up call for the people being influenced by those who are trying to persuade others to spend more money just to buy from Amazon. Buy from the retailer that is cheaper for you. Some states do charge sales tax for Amazon but not Newegg and vice versa. Contrary to the belief of one individual on the ad that was posted today

The customer service of both Amazon and Newegg are fantastic. Those saying otherwise probably have never had a problem with them and are just spewing the same garbage they heard from the last person who said it.

I will be able to contribute a little more than I did last time.  I am also open to anyone that would like to donate or [sponsor the giveaway like last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/taq35/winners_of_the_2012_buld_a_pc_sales_contest/).

Now to the fun part.  What would you

Throw a bunch of names on random.org and pick the winners (That's no fun)?  

A scavenger type hunt for a PC build under a set spending limit but meets the requirements for a new game?

What kind of prizes would you be interested in?  Gift cards?  A specific PC product?

Let's throw around some ideas and see what we can come up with.  We should be able to set up a nice event giving the increase in subs since last Spring.

I thought that was strange but continued on and filled out all of my information again and to my surprise at the end of all of it I was billed for two of the TV's rather than just the one I wanted. I'm not a stranger to buying things online and have had this happen before so I shoot an email to there ""Customer service"" and inform them of the situation and was expecting them to just remove one because nothing had been ordered as of yet. Wrong... They have it set to show that they print the label the minute that your order is complete and by there reasoning this means the order has already been shipped and nothing can be changed. They did how ever say that I could ship it back to them and they would refund me the money

I reasoned with myself that I would just end up using it or selling it on craigslist and would just wait it out. Well I waited

1350340008.0,11jauf,OK... The whole Black Friday cult thing is sort of getting out of hand(why you shouldnt wait until Black Friday),okp11,144,40,56,"It seems like almost every deal post here there is someone asking ""Should I wait for black Friday?!?!?"". Yes

-**Black Friday is more than a month away.** Computer Parts go down in price as time goes by. This descent in price will occur whether Black Friday happens or not. You can have a fully functional computer now or you can wait and have the same computer for cheaper. Thats just how it works.

-**Black Friday is for mostly brick &amp; mortar chains.** Most of these places are going to be having sales on regular consumer electronics. Places like Staples and Best Buy might have some good deals on hard drives or monitors but past that these places probably arent worth your time unless you are looking for peripherals. There are some exceptions like Microcenter and Frys that will probably have some deals on PC hardware but just remember that for every great deal there is a moron who is willing to wait outside in the rain for 24 hours to get it first. 

-**Cyber Monday**(the day for internet retailer deals) will be following BF and is what you should really be waiting for. Yes some sites will have both Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday sales but if the past is any indication of which one is more worthwhile than its safe to say that Cyber Monday is the day for most of the deals.

-**Many sales will be limited in quantity.** On both Cyber Monday and Black Friday everyone and their mother will be prowling through the stores/web to find the best deals so dont expect to hit pay-dirt even if there is a sale on an item you want....which brings me to my final and most important point.

-**DONT EXPECT EVERY ITEM TO BE ON SALE**. People just assume everything they need for their build will magically be on sale on BF and CM. That's extremely improbable. Most places like Newegg and TigerDirect will release some really large Ads but dont expect category wide price cuts.

**TLDR**: Stop posting in every thread asking if you should wait for Black Friday. Any answer you get is going to be no less speculative than your own imagination can conjure up. If you have been eying a component for a while and find a good deal on it in the next month and a half then its safe to say you wont regret buying it.

Hello /r/buildapcsales!

We've been contacted by /r/buildapc in regards to users wanting to have their own contests and giveaways.  They thought it would be best to direct that traffic and submissions to this sub.  Myself and /u/driscoll42 discussed this and have come to an agreement that we will allow these type of posts.  

There are only a few guidelines that will need to be met

* Users are allow to start their own contest or giveaway.
* These will be operated in a self post
* No outside sites, or forums that are having a contest are allowed to be posted
* **Mods are not responsible for any of the contests that are outside of the official /r/buildapcsales contest/giveaways**

We want to keep the sub as clean as possible and with the rule of not allowing outside links to contests will help with that.  

Also, they are solely responsible to manager and gift the rewards to the winners.

With these changes

If there is a user who has a small company (e.g. from previous contest sponsors; Quixby

EDIT: Great find by /u/walrus4lyfe. There's also a promo going on, and they'll take $30 off, giving you the twin-pack fans for free, or even lowering the price of your order. For example, if you order the 650D for $100, and add the AF140 to your order, your total comes to $88.99 (plus shipping for the fan, and tax if applicable).

http://www.corsair.com/promo

* AF140: $18.99 (save $11.01 off your order)
* AF120 and SP120: $29.99 (save $.01 off your order)
* SP120 PWM: $34.99 (add $4.99 to your order)

HOWEVER - They will now add shipping for the fans. For CA

* Standard 4-6 days - $4.89
* UPS Ground - $6.86
* UPS 2nd Day Air - $60.34

Annnnd looks like the site is getting hammered.

Here's what it looked like in my cart. Decided not to get it

It's possible they sell bundles for cheaper than buying it from amazon or newegg or other websites.

For example I just purchased the NZXT Phantom and NZXT Kraken x60.

Including tax from amazon the case cost $271.55 and the Kraken cost $149.89 which equals $421.44

I was then doing some research on them and typed both at the same time into google and [got a hit on the NZXT website.](http://store.nzxt.com/product_p/sp-p820-x60.htm)

Yup

Fuck me but whatever

This will come in handy when an OP forgets to add it in the title.  All users will be able to add this flair on their own posts.

Basically the idea is to pool all of our collective bargaining power together so we can get a better deal from the manufacturer (the site probably takes a small cut for fee). I know everyone's build is unique and we each have our own needs, and even monitors can be similar enough that we can make this work. 

We won't have to deal with the fluctuation in pricing from vendors

1363204839.0,1a8it0,Massdrop Voting,Brooderz,80,29,55,"Currently there are 3 Massdrop votes that will be of interest the this subreddit.

For those wondering what Massdrop is - It's where people vote on which product they want to buy and once complete Massdrop goes to the manufacturer and negotiates a deal. Once this has happened there are goals in sales that reduce the price for each goal achieved e.g. 5 purchases means 5% off and 20 purchases could mean 10%. **It costs nothing to vote** and also **there's no money spent until the sale has completed meaning you you only spend the lowest price it goes to** (sorry for bad explanation - for example if you buy when it's 5% off and it reduces further to 20% then you get it for the 20% discounted price)

If what I said makes no sense (I don't blame you

There's a vote on which **256Gb SSD** to get - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/61

A vote on which **Gaming/Mechanical Keyboard** - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/gaming-keyboards

And which **Soldering Iron** to get - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/soldering-stations-1

All you do is select you're top 3 choices and it should be up soon from what I've seen.

I've saw Massdrop on here before for a mechanical keyboard deal but it's came back again.

Upvote please - If enough of us vote then hopefully we get a good deal.",self,t5_2s3dh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1a8it0/massdrop_voting/

PSU: [OCZ ModXStream 700W]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/r84jj/amazon_ocz_700w_modular_80_power_supply_5999_with/) $30

Motherboard: [ASRock Z77 Extreme4 LGA 1155]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/18kqab/motherboard_open_box_asrock_z77_extreme4_lga_1155/) $90

CPU: [Intel 3570K]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/13nry1/intel_core_i53570k_lighting_deal_on_amazon_140_pst/) $190

Memory:  [G.Skill RipJaws X Series 2x8GB] (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/151170/ram_gskill_ripjaws_x_series_16gb_2_x_8gb_240pin/) $65

SSD:  [Kingston HyperX 3K 120 GB](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/11d41k/ssd_kingston_hyperx_3k_solid_state_drive_120_gb/) $60

GPU:  [MSI R7850 Twin Frozr 2GD5/OC ](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/199l93/gpu_msi_r7850_twin_frozr_2gd5oc_factory/) $170

Case: [Corsair Carbide Series 200R]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/16ycp3/amazon_us_corsair_carbide_series_200r_compact_atx/) $45

**Total Price: $650 with shipping**

I’m really pleased with how the rig turned out.  I spent almost a year building it but I think the cost savings were well worth it. I just ordered a set of Noctua 120s to replace the Corsair fans. I’m waiting on a CPU cooler to go on sale
After the cooler I’m saving for an ODAC

Other stuff on the desk: 

-[ Majestouch 2 with blue keys]( http://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=759)

-[ Razer Goliathus Control Edition]( http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-goliathus-control-edition)

-[ Razer Mouse Bungee]( http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-mouse-bungee)

-[ Razer Diamondback 3G]( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826153027)

-[ Razer Carcharias]( http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-carcharias-for-xbox-pc)

-Asus 24” something (nothing special)

-Dell 2007WFP

Thanks again BuildaPC contributors! You helped me get a lot out of my budget for this build

**Step #2** - Scroll down to where there is a box that talks about a combo discount when you purchase another item with the item you want. **Usually the item they list sucks so people just disregard it altogether. DONT DO THIS!!** [There is a link in the bottom right corner that says ""Browse more combos"". Click this.](http://i.imgur.com/3KyXoh.png)

**Step #3** - Browse through the items they list to see if there is anything you might want. Most of the time the items you want will have a bigger discount than if you bought the items separately. (The only time this isnt the case is if the items have promo codes that take off a larger amount than the combo discount offers...more on this later)

**Step #4** - DO YOU RESEARCH!!! Since you cant use promo codes on the combos check to see if it would be better to buy the items separately. I show this in the slideshow. You can however still use rebates and ""special offers"" with the combos so keep that in mind when shopping.

Now some of you might find this remedial but I know for a fact there are plenty of shoppers out there that don't ever check for combos on items they are about to buy. That was me until a few weeks ago when I scored BIG on a $3 usb car charger lol. I know it might seem silly that I'm even posting a guide for something like this but people need to know that they can be saving money.

Yes I understand that this isnt a sale.

**Edit: IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME THAT YOU CAN INDEED USE ""PERCENT OFF"" PROMO CODES WITH COMBOS!! ITS ONLY THE SET AMOUNT DOLLAR OFF CODES THAT YOU CANT USE!!**",self,t5_2s3dh,1343099100.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/x1bcx/a_guide_to_bundling_items_on_neweggwith_pictures/

Promo Code: VME10BTS

Offer expires 8/19/2013 or while funds last. Does not include Newegg Promotional Gift Cards

About V.me:

You sign up with V.me and input you credit card information. From what I can see

This Promo code is not that much, GPU, MOBO's and etc... especially if they have a rebate will save a lot. It says one discount per customer. I will try multiple accounts on Newegg and maybe you can use the same V.me account and save on each purchase. 

For example, MOBO on another account, save $20, and CPU on another... That will net you a lot of saving if this would work.

**What I am buying**

I tried buying a Newegg gift card, you go on their website and purchase a Steam card with the Zeevex card. So buying $100 will save you $10 and so on...

Promo Code: BTSPER4

There are a couple of things here that I would get and have had before. Items must be on the Promo Link to be able to be discounted by the promo code.

I have both the Desk Mounts. They are heavy and durable. Supports the weight of 21"" monitors. Only downside is that your desk need to be a certain thickness. I solved this by just folding up cardboard and using that to gap the space between the desk and clamp.

I have used Monoprice many of times

I'll change the A records for anyone who can PM me what they'll do with it. If multiple offers are presented I'll choose based on merit of the proposal

Now with that out of the way, but soda dried into the CPU socket, and its a loss there. Don't have the money to replace it atm, and not looking for handouts either. Unfortunately, that was the only PC I had though, so I have nothing to get the files off of my hard drives (which should be okay). I don't really feel like redoing my own work on a different computer either.

I placed an order through Adorama when I found that they had a SSD cheaper than anywhere else. I ordered the part Friday May 17 2013 and shortly after, Adorama tells me that I have to wait to send the package back and wait for them to process my refund. I am not a wealthy person so this put me in quite a financial pickle.

I wanted to let r/buildapc know. I had read that a few other people have had this problem. If you guys have any feedback or if this has happened to you and you can confirm it

TL;DR Declined for a part order. Ordered the part elsewhere. Initial part is charged after being declined. Debt.

UPDATE: The reason I went through this company was because newegg suggested it. The company that is sending the package is the one that must issue the ""package intercept"" is what USPS called it. Their site states clearly in their policy that if an order is to be cancelled or intercepted, the order has not shipped. I assume that they would be the first people to know. I kept getting a lot of resistance to even look to see if it had shipped, which I'm sure would have taken maybe one phone call. Then they denied that they could do a package intercept, when I know that it would have cost them 10$ to do it, which is probably why they wouldn't. It looks like I'm just going to have to take it. I'll just have to wait for the package, send it back, and wait for my refund to process. Thanks for all the suggestions and help. I hope you guys are careful when ordering from this company.
