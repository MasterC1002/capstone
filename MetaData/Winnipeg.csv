If you see/hear ANYTHING please PM me on here and I will forward it all to the owner.

[Here's an album of pictures](http://imgur.com/a/1q5lk)

[Here's the lost dog poster](http://i.imgur.com/BIabovD.jpg)


Once again I really appreciate it

EDIT: [Here is the Winnipeg Lost Dog Facebook Photo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=555288717823271&amp;set=a.190661520952661.48803.189085261110287&amp;type=1)

EDIT 2: He was last seen under the Dugald bridge near the floodway (This was Monday).

EDIT 3: I just got the PDF file for the lost poster from the owner and I'm printing out about 300 copies. I hate wasting paper but to be honest I'm open to anything right now.If you guys want to [Here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6HsPsaF66dSM3FaV1c5X0lhMmc/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to the  file. 

EDIT 3.5: We are going out Saturday to put up posters and going out tonight (Friday) to lockport to go search around there/around 59. With this wicked cold it's hard to keep an optimistic view but animals have done this for thousands of years and I know Titan is a fighter. Myself personally and my friend (the owner) really appreciates this. He's not a redditor but he says thank you to everybody supporting the search for Titan.

EDIT 4: We are putting posters up along the highways and into communities around Winnipeg today. Getting the word out is now the biggest priority

EDIT 5: The owner and his girlfriend had spotted titan around Oakbank. He has gone into full survival mode and isn't even acting like himself. He bolted away, tons of posters are up and even door to door in the communities around Winnipeg.",,False,self,t5_2qtno,1359993844.0,,

In the early 1900s Winnipeg had serious problems with its water supply, while the well water wrecked machinery and was rough on the stomach.  This is due to being very mineral rich, as the aquifer underneath winnipeg lays on a limestone bedrock.

City of Winnipeg (which as growing at a very fast rate..pre-panama canal) decided to take the long approach, et al.), Shoal Lake was graded as the highest, most pristine quality.  And being 300ft higher in elevation, this would allow for an aqueduct to be built.

Through special act of Provincial Legislature, employing many men to build the railway, and also cut down trees for lumber--which was resold.  Much rough terrain such as muskeg was present, but it was overcome.  A series of train station were setup, and some town such as East Braintree (named as of such due to Braintree, USA potentially causing postal mixups) were founded.

The final station on the GWWD railway, on Indian Bay.  Snowshoe bay is dammed off, as falcon lake came into it, and made the water less blue. (this is visible on google maps; http://g.co/maps/894k5)

Over a few years, slightly graded so that gravity would do all the work.  From the inlet on Indian Bay, until the water reaches the Deacon Reservoir in Winnipeg (Deacons Corner), it is all gravity fed!  The aqueduct brings 80,000,000 Gallons Per Day.

The water is chlorinated (and fluoridated as well) along the way to keep out pests.

So, this is some of the best water you can get!

Did you know that the Queen decided on one of her tours through Canada that Winnipeg's water would be her official water for the rest of the tour?

Yeah, including an 1885 conversation between a citizen and the old Winnipeg water works utility, which used the water from assinboine.(ever see the WWW water caps in the ground?  near River Heights, and Misericordia, etc.  The Cornish Library is their old pumping station).

Fun Fact; prior to aqueduct, it would completely destroy buildings and merchandise inside, as it got mud all over everything!",,False,self,t5_2qtno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/q9n14/winnipeg_has_some_of_the_best_tap_water_in_the/

1351788219.0,12gqgp,[UPDATE]: American seeking foodie guidance in preparations for Winnipeg visit! VISIT COMPLETE!  ,twoleggedpiglet,63,7,23,"Good Morning Winnipeg!

6 months ago I made a post here on r/Winnipeg asking for advice regarding an upcoming trip to Winnipeg  - [you can read that post here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/s5212/american_seeking_foodie_guidance_in_preparations/). The response I received from you guys was overwhelming! We (my SO and I) really want to thank everyone who made suggestions for things to do around Winnipeg as it made our trip one of the best ever. 

First off, lots of things to see and do on foot. It was an experience well beyond our expectations and we have you guys to thank for that. 

Second, mostly Food porn with our thoughts on the restaurants and and things you guys all suggested.  The goal is not to be ""critics"" here, just provide our view of the experience. Since you guys took the time to share your opinions with us we wanted to share our experience with you. 

[Here is the link to the first post!](http://www.thepigletandtheboar.com/2012/09/13/travels-in-canada-winnipeg-day-1-part-1/) 

We are trying to update it at least once a week, Calgary, Las Vegas, and stuff from here at home in California. Hope you enjoy it and thanks again! 

P.S. Neither of us write or take photos for a living. This is something we just do for fun. There won't be any ads or spam here and we just ask that if there is any criticism try to make it constructive.

I want to get high.
 
I want marijuana laws reformed.
 
I want to show the police/media/government that not ALL of us stoners are inconsiderate morons.
 
 
UPDATE: 
 
 I will be flying a sign saying simply; ""KEEP 4/20 GREEN!"" with a pot leaf drawn in the background, and a rake or two. I plan on going around during the actual protest and offering groups of people garbage bags for their trash. Hopefully that will lessen the amount of stuff we need to pick up.

The doctors and nurses were all really nice, yelled right back and got the job done. One guy needed stitches and seemed to refuse treatment, he ended up just walking out against the doc's suggestion. They checked on us hourly when we were there, and the nurses and all the attending were very helpful and detail oriented. 

One time a nurse said she was going to get more sheets, it's easy to see with a full ER how they can run out for a bit (need to be sure to save some for new patients). Sometimes it seemed like the staff had some time on their hands, but that only lasted a few hours and then they were clearly overworked again, it's amazing how much they get done when the ER fills up.

I had about 12 days to play and decided to see.

Headed out from Winnipeg going south on Pembina Highway through Saint Norbert and Saint Adolphe. The TCT was far too muddy and rough for my bike so I continued along the highway. Stopped briefly at the Mennonite Memorial Landing Site

Woke up and explored St.Malo a bit. Continued south and picked up the TCT just south of St.Malo. It was a rough trail that varied between quad ruts and knee high grass, but it got cold and dark so I stopped in Dominion City.

Lots of wind and a poorly setup hammock made this cold night terrible. Got a coffee from the grocery store and headed east on Highway 201 out from Dominion City.  13km later and I had an excellent breakfast at the Letellier Hotel . Explored Letellier a bit, it wasn’t open for the season yet.  Stopped at a church in Morden for a fish fry dinner, it was excellent.  With a belly full of fish I headed to Lake Minnewasta to camp for the night.

Had an excellent at Lake Minnewasta and headed a mile west there the TCT picks up again. After a few kms of country roads the familiar quad trail continues. The trail left GPS range


[Day 5&amp;6 – May 27&amp;28 2012 ](https://picasaweb.google.com/105289714923942416155/May2012BikeAdventureDay56?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCNGRwJK0n8GuGw&amp;feat=directlink)

Camping in Manitou was the coldest night yet. It rained all night, and mumbling cold.  I Decided I wasn’t coving any distance that way. Packed up and headed a motel in Manitou. Everything is closed on a Sunday in a small town so I had lunch in the motel restaurant and moped in my motel room for the day.

Woke up on day 6 feeling restored, I think they have been there for a while; I took pictures of the some of the nicer art. I spent too much time taking pictures of train cars. The TCT picks up again in Cypress Rivers and heads south in to Spruce Woods National Park, but it was too muddy to follow and I had to turn around. Went to camp in Cypress Rivers but the marked was not hammock friendly, the motel was super sketchy looking. 


[Day 7 – May 29 2012 ](https://picasaweb.google.com/105289714923942416155/May2012BikeAdventureDay7?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCLWXi6OPgvi9Gg&amp;feat=directlink)

First night camping somewhere that is not explicitly a campground, cleaned my bike, and contemplated my strategy for tomorrow.

Dilemma:  

*Continue to Riding Mountain 

*Hang out in Spruce Woods and check out day trails in the area

*Risk not making it home on time under my own power if the weather turns bad


[Day 8 – May 30 2012 ](https://picasaweb.google.com/105289714923942416155/May2012BikeAdventureDay8?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCLy_7cS5pZ-krAE&amp;feat=directlink)

Overnight I decided that it’s more important to get home under my own power than make it Riding Mountain. When I got up I felt amazing

Woke up and played in the arcade at the campground. Spent a lot of time trying to get a picture of this crop duster I kept meeting up with.

So still didn't have a fridge but

I am beyond sick of this and realistically just want my fridge. So Winnipeg if your looking for any kind of customer service don't go to Dufresne! 
 
EDIT: Well Tomorrow the fridge is supposed to come. Any time between 11-5...... So hopefully it all works out. I will update when it arrives. They happened to ""find"" one in the storage room.

But there in NYC

I ended up coming back to my home in South Georgia. Now I'm striking out for the great unknown again. This time though it'll be different. I want to live some place firmly rooted in the future. I want to live some place that's very multicultural. 

Some place with good jobs and a decent cost of living.  I know it's incredibly stereotypical but I'm an American who wants to emigrate to Canada. 

I'm applying to the University of Manitoba in the next month or so. I think it's the best idea I've had in a long time. Am I right? 

Educate me. Thanks bunches.

Long time reader

Anyone recently noticed money missing from their bank account?  That's a scary prospect for many. Being a 27 year old in Winnipeg

I was checking my account balance online last night to see if the three outstanding cheques I wrote had been cashed yet, I was clearly in Winnipeg (I work down town in the exchange district, several co-workers can vouch for my whereabouts) I also don't own a car, so $500+ in transactions at a shell should seem a little strange. :P

I've reported the theft to the bank

I'm a creature of habit: I work downtown and live in Wolseley

The only two leads I have are hardly even circumstantial. 
* Last Friday (May 3'th
* Last Tuesday, and I'm under the impression that the location recently changed managers. (though I have no facts to support this, just seeing new faces I didn't remember seeing regularly)

Beyond that: here's a quick list of everywhere else I've shopped in the last 31 days, I'd love to hear from you!

Please reddit-mail me any time

* TIM HORTONS #39 - in Winnipeg Square
* A.M.FOODFARE #1 - Portage and Burnell
* 7-ELEVEN 15198 - 781 Corydon Ave
* RED RIVER COOP Gas Bar - 650 Archibald at Marion
* NEW YORK FRIES - in Polo Park
* THE PITA PIT - 211 Bannatyne
* CANADA SAFEWAY - 3059 Ness Ave (the one by polo park)
* NON-TD ATM W/D - the ATM at the forks (Scotia bank unit by the food court
* VALUE VILLAGE - 1695 Ellice Ave
* PIZZA HOTLINE - delivery
* STELLA'S CAFE - Sherbrook location
* YIHO SUSHI CAFE - on Sherbrook
* BARCHET'S FOOD - In Wolseley

One of the worst was at Gusto recently.  Arrived shortly before 6:30 to put our name in for a table, give them our phone number and go elsewhere for a drink which is fairly standard practice there.  We get a phone call around 50 minutes later that our table is ready and to head back.  The hostess upon our arrival looks confused, and informs us that she has sat someone else at our table, without bothering to check their names.  She then tells us that another table should ""be available soon"".  In the end we waited for another 45 minutes, while she sat two other tables before us.  Basically the only reason we stayed was because we had waited so long already.

**1. Consider what you will be using the bike for.**  If you are looking for a straight up commuter, may be your cup of tea.  If you are looking to go on long rides for fitness, maybe you want a road bike(ten-speed style for my fellow old fogies), with thin tires that decrease rolling resistance and make pedaling easier with a frame geometry that puts you in a more aerodynamic position. You probably won't want a road bike for commuting, but to each their own.

**2. Budget:** Buying a bike at an auction can be a mixed bag.  You may get a good deal, headset, bearings, bottom brackets and shifters/levers and cables.  Spin the wheels to see how 'true' or straight they are.  Squeeze pairs of spokes to see how taut or loose they are.  Lift the bike by the seat and work the pedals to see if the crankarms are loose.  look for missing or loose teeth on the cogs and gear rings.  Better yet, have someone else lift the back of the bike by the seat and pedal with one hand while you shift with the other to see how smoothly it shifts or whether the shift levers and cables are in good shape.  Put your ear on the seat and slowly turn the pedals in reverse and listen carefully for any grinding or missing bearings, a good bottom bracket should not make any strange sounds.  If at all possible, RIDE THE BIKE!  You will find out immediately what problems exist if any. Parts for bikes are not cheap and many require special tools to install or remove, don't bother buying it unless it is a high end bike in good condition that you plan to ride for a few years and keep professionally maintained.

**3. Quality:** reputable big name brands like Trek, Gary Fisher, Cannondale etc. are going to be better build bikes and more expensive, which generally means that the owners will have treated them better and kept them well-maintained.  They will probably require less maintenance over time but the parts will be expensive.  On the other hand, a cheaper Hardware Store bike from Canadian Tire or Walmart will be cheaper, throwaway type bikes that have lower quality parts(ie plastic housings instead of metal) that often cannot be replaced and may end up with you having to get rid of the bike altogether.  Some people buy lots of cheap bikes and ride them to failure, others buy more expensive bikes and fix and replace what needs it.  Depending on your budget, and how and where you ride


Whatever bike you chose, steer clear of any sealed hubs or bearings (hubs on both wheels, bottom bracket and headset[where the forks and handlebars connect to the frame]).  Let the bike dry then lightly lubricate the chain, cables, and other moving parts.

I was willing to look past all that, I left the stadium that night feeling like they were on the verge of a turn-around.

My faith in the Bombers football operations was crushed the next morning when Joe Mack fired Coach LaPo.  I knew right then that that turn-around I had felt the night before had just been turned to dust.  I know Mack had his reasons ... but it just seemed like a real slime-ball move.  Like he went right from talking to the players to firing LaPo without trying to fix what he felt was broken. And the timing of the move - even I could tell it was just wrong.

Since Mack fired LaPo, from the board right down to the players, well they just don't care.  So why should I?  Good luck Bombers paying for your new stadium.  Call me when you fire the board, Buchko, Mack, and the coaching staff.

Constant parties, tresspasing. You name it, it happened.

Throughout this time, and then it was annoying but we would speak to the current tenants and they would stop for a while, no big deal... About 3 years ago, I had enough. People were moving out and decided to throw household junk AND garbage out of both windows. I brought their mop and garbage back onto their porch and left it there. The next day, my dog found a pound of rancid meat that had been thrown out of said window, and that was it!

I phoned the provincial landlord and tenancy board to lodge a formal complaint. They said there was nothing they could do as an official would have to come and see it happening or we would have to catch this person(s). They instructed me to send a registered letter to the landlord himself and make the complaint directly to him. This was done

Well

The cops rarely come out anymore as they have been called to that house many times

What can I do? Has ANYONE else had this type of problem? Help!! The longer this goes on, and their home.

Pecking out this message very slowly because I've got a bandaged hand (PROTIP: oil can be hot

When you think of board games, but these are the board game equivalent of McDonald's food. Cheap, ubiquitous, borderline tolerable, and deeply unsatisfying.

To keep this post short

I have a collection of about 100 games. I play with my friends, and total strangers, so I need a really wide variety. Some take 10 minutes; some take a whole afternoon. None of them are as boring as Monopoly or Risk. (It's probably also worth mentioning that less than half of these games have a sci-fi/fantasy theme, in case that's a turn-off.)

My appetite for playing games is apparently bigger than my friends'

So: 

* Would any of y'all be interested in learning more about modern board games? 
* Anyone have any favourites that you'd recommend? 
* Say I was to arrange a r/winnipeg board game night. I could host

**EDIT**: Here are some of the games we play that see a lot of table time:

* Settlers of Catan
* Ticket To Ride
* Carcassonne
* Dominion
* Race for the Galaxy 
* Dixit
* 7 Wonders",self,t5_2qtno,1339344298.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/uq2t6/who_likes_board_games/

2) Does no one in this city signal? We Calgary drivers are assholes

3) Why do your streets magically morph into new streets with a different name even though its the same street (ie - Regent).

4) Went to see a relative play Polo at Birds Hill Park

5) Just an observation but my back has never sweat so much. Jesus.

6) St. Vital has no starbucks. Can someone get on that?

7) Your grass is WAY softer here. (I mean lawn grass that I walked on /r/trees people)

Anyhow, at about 1 in the morning I wake up in serious pain. My wrist, which I had apparently fell on, had swollen up like a mother-fucker and I was troubled by it. I took some Advil and iced it for a while, then tried to go back to sleep. This failed, and by 3 in the morning I was concerned that I had actually hurt myself, so I called Health Links(a 24hr. phone service where a nurse will do his/her best to help you over the phone) who told me that I should probably get it checked out sooner than later. 

With my girlfriend's help, who informed me, in the friendliest way possible, that the x-ray lab was closed between 2:00 and 7:30 each morning. My options were to stay there for a few hours, go home and come back in the morning or head out to a different hospital, of which the closest would be St.B or the HSC. I opted for the St.B, and so after a short cab ride, or shortly after.

After the triage, the results came back(negative, thankfully, seriously sprained though(this is taking forever to type with one hand)), I was given a small dose of T3's and sent on my merry way. I would have been home by 6:30, but the buses weren't running yet, so I walked over to a McD's and watched sports highlights in the very swanky new interior.

As I sat in McDonald's with my ""coffee, but really, I walked through part of downtown at 3am without even thinking about my safety, because it simply was not a concern. Then I went to perhaps the second busiest ER in the city and was in and out, with a totally non-vital injury in a little less than 2 hours.
