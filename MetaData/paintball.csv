1371140414.0,1g9xke,Why I will NEVER endorse a GoG gun.,BonesJackson,164,37,112,"People sometimes ask me why I have a problem recommending GoG guns. I think it's a fair question that deserves an answer.

Short version: The company is run by scummy people to whom I hate giving money.

Longer version: GoG is owned by Adam and Billy Gardner who formerly owned Smart Parts. Smart Parts made many iconic parts and guns over the years including:

 - All-American barrels

 - Freak Barrels

 - Max-Flo regulators

 - The Shocker in all its variants

 - The Ion

 - The SP-1

 - The Vibe

 - The Impulse and more

In 2006 Smart Parts filed a class-action lawsuit which was more or less aimed at the paintball industry. Because they had contracted the first electropneumatic paintball gun (the Shocker

Up until this point every major technological breakthrough for paintball had been public domain. Tippmann came up with the idea to use Schraeder valves in tanks as a means of safe delivery of air to the gun and safe storage. Glenn Palmer came up with the mechanics to make a semi-automatic guns a reality. Tom Kaye of AGD introduced High Pressure Air to the market as an alternative to CO2. Lee Kirwan introduced a way of making o-rings work in valves that made spool valves infinitely more flexible. None of them asked for royalties. Additionally

[The following is a summation provided by user HP_Lovecraft on the MCB forums who says it much better than I can. There's actually a lot more specific useful info in the thread linked:](http://www.mcarterbrown.com/forums/dead-zone/178725-dr-hensel-pvi-cyber-9000-sp-wdp-patent-battle-history.html)

""*The short version was that SP hired PVI to design

*Neither party was happy with the arrangement

*And PVI went out of business. The bank took everything, etc). Here SP bought up the patent, design, equipment, etc. They went on to produce the Shocker 4x4. But the Shocker 4x4 was a grand failure. By now, far, far better guns had hit the market, Bushmaster

*So used the PVI patent and revised it to be far more general, or stopping production. All except WDP. They had the money to properly fight SP.*

*And they discovered something interesting- PVI (and its bank) was only partial owner of the patent. PVI hired Professor Hensel to do the original design work. For payment

*That crushed SP. From that point they were no longer able to sue over the electro patent. In court, and development stages.*""

When Smart Parts went out of business a few years ago, that Adam and Billy had somehow, even though the bank sold all the intellectual property rights, been able to buy up all the old designs and patents at auction under another name. People began to realize that Smart Parts is like a goddamn mythical Hydra, where you cut off one head and 7 more spring up.

Suddenly GoG appeared. The sum of all fears. SP-1? Now it's the G-1. Oh god they've renamed the Ion and the Vibe,,False,,t5_2qkm6,False,,True

* Water. Don't get dehydrated and die. That sucks.
* More water. Share with the poor schmucks that didn't bring any.
* Batteries. Having the correct ones for your gun/hopper helps. I like going to BatteriesPlus and buying sticks of 9vs to keep in my gear bag.
* Rags. You want two kinds. Random shop rags for wiping paint off your gun &amp; clothes
* Anti-fog spray. 'nuff said. 
* Barrel swabs. A stick and a piece of cloth works in a pinch. Or a branch from a pine tree. 
* Paint caddy. These things are great. You will never spill paint trying to pour from a bag again. Slap some stickers on there look like a pro. MAD CRED HHHHHH
* Snacks on snacks. I bring 8 different flavors of cereal every time I play.
* Cooler + Ice. Keep your paint cool on hot days. Keep your water cool. Keep your snacks cool. Keep your cool.
* A good attitude. Nobody likes playing with a douchebag. 
* Spare gun, you can always loan it out to someone who is having trouble with theirs. That makes people happy. 
* More water. Just in case. 
* Tools
* A smile. :)
* Rope. you never know when you need rope. 
* Clean clothes to put on after playing. Or dirty clothes. I don't care. Wear a burlap sack for all I care. 
* First Aid kit. Patch people up if they get hurt. Which is unlikely. Paintball is super safe.  
* Suntan lotion to prevent sunburn. Have you ever been shot while sunburnt? It feels great.

I got in touch with Raza - they seemed to be the best deal and quality for the jerseys. They got back to me right away. Here's what they said:

&gt;Hi nerfwarhero
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for contacting us for your jersey needs.
&gt;
&gt;We would love to help you and your forum out with a custom jersey. For orders this large, you can either place the order yourself and handle the shipping, OR we can create a custom web store and handle it all for you. If we create the web store we would refund the $500 deposit once we had reached $2000 in sales.
&gt;
&gt;Cost per jerseys for the TM2 would be $60 + $10 for name/number.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know when you are ready to get started.

SO! what I need from you, and check out. They'll then e-mail you the template for the jersey and you can get to work designing a jersey in illustrator CS5 or later in vector format. Please then message me an imgur link to a .jpg of your design, or post it here. I'll make a post **next Wednesday** of all of the designs and you can vote on them reddit style. If we can't agree on a design, or we haven't produced one at all, they have offered to do the design for us for free.

**YOU HAVE UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY AT 12 NOON EASTERN TIME TO SUBMIT DESIGNS**

**tl;dr:** We're getting jerseys. They're going to be $60 (+$10 if you want name and number). If you want to help design it

Usually the paintball community here and all over is fantastic and I know that you are all respectful to one another. The problem seems to lie at the fields, the problem I have is that its not a friendly little banter that we all do it's the actual hurtful insults towards one another.


Should it not matter what we use or how we play. Each and every marker from a die hard Milsim A5, Mini or G6R; what about the Auto mags and pumps. Each and every marker is fantastic in their own way and each marker can and will have perks and cons to it.  Why should you get cussed and insulted into oblivion for using it. Daily I will always overhear some 12 yr old bashing other players for what they use, and its not just the younger ones, I've seen a lot of adults do it too (I'm 20 so right in between). Like really are we not all out there to have fun and enjoy the day shooting each other? While friendly competitive banter is okay in some areas, things escalate fairly fast and that's where feelings get hurt. 

Personal story. Was playing indoor rec ball with my out dated and slightly aged Smart Parts Ion (still have 2) two guys with brand new Ego 10s and Geos decided to bash me. Instead of bantering them back I just said ""whatever"" and went and played. I let my marker do the talking and talking did it do. Not only was it able to keep up with newer electros

Point?: Let the markers do the talking

Redditors of paintball. I ask that should you overhear some little more than friendly banter going on


tl:dr? Go back up and read dammit. Put a lot of heart into this post. :)


Thanks Reddit

I'm going to walk you through a typical paintball experience

You start your adventure in the magical land of the parking lot.  If you have a gun, cherish it.  While brandishing your Spyder around the parking lot, also please dry fire a few times to hear the nice loud noises it makes.  Ignore the referees if they yell at you to stop, because you aren't going to hurt anyone anyway.  You're smarter than that.

If you don't have a gun, rest assured that your hours spent on the XBox will not go to waste.  It's basically the same thing, except easier because your opponent can't screenwatch you and you don't lag.

You'll pay for admission in whatever manner your field of choice so designates, it's a solid plan to go to Walmart and buy a case or two of Monster-brand ammunition before you come.  This paint is basically the same thing as what the field is selling, so there's no point paying more for the same.  Try to sneak in your non-field paint through creative and ingenious methods including the time-tested classic, ""Oh hey man I don't got no non-field paint.""  If for some unknowable reason they decide to look in your bag anyway, take care to hide your paint in pods.  They'll never think to look in there.

Now it's time, which allegedly correlates to a rental gun in the line of guns set up in the window next to you.  However, using the number system is for idiots and it's a good idea to just scream your number loudly and look confused before abruptly grabbing a gun at random.  If anyone should accost you about this, make sure to put on your best thousand-yard stare and look right through them.  These guys probably aren't paid enough to care too much about what gun you're actually using, anyway.  If you were foolish and purchased your own paint, now is a good time to throw the box on the table next to you and start to fill your gun with ammunition.  Ignore the referees that look irritated that you have apparently interrupted their cleaning or distribution of some sort of equipment, since this table is only intended for your immediate convenience.  You might wish to stock up on paint grenades and a camouflage jumpsuit, since these are two gamechanging tactical advantages over your foes.  I cannot stress enough that grenades and the jumpsuit will make you a significantly better player from the very start.

You will probably be shooed from the table by some lazy referees who want your table for themselves.  It is at this point that, you do not want to go in the woods, those people are unclean.  If you ask insistently enough, the referees will eventually let you take one of the nice tents that are reserved for private groups.  It doesn't even matter if you don't have 20 people: just ask enough and you can be your own group, all four of you, and you will get your own group, tent, and special treatment.

Chances are, and then ask if you can go to the target range to shoot.  At any point at all, feel free to pull the trigger, like a lot, to make sure your gun is working.  Only do this if your gun is loaded and has air, however, otherwise you won't know if it really works.  You can also take your barrel plug off the gun whenever you want

Soon you will begin to play, to the head referee.  He will be happy to answer you as well as bend the rules to whatever you and your friends want to do.  If he says no, ask him a lot.  If he still refuses, get angry and ask to become a private group.

A referee will probably try to explain the rules to you, by the way, is ""maps"" or ""levels.""    Once rules have been explained, you will be asked to separate into armbands and no armbands.  That thing on your wrist is part of your arm, but you also probably have no idea what an armband is.  Make sure to ask the referee loudly about it, preferably while he's talking to someone else.

Once you go on the field, and this tactical advantage of uninhibited sight will truly propel you to victory later.  For now, however, take a few test shots at some piece of cover.  You want to make sure, yet again, your gun is working.  With the game about to start, you should probably put your mask on finally.  Proper mask placement is determined by having the visor end nearest towards your chin, and show him that you are a tactically-minded and skilled individual who can contribute to the team.  The best way to accomplish this is to say words like ""flank

The game will start soon, you'll stay in the starting bunker and snipe.  After all, your Call of Duty experience has made you an expert sniper, and you've even played that level with the wind and bullet drop.  You're more than qualified for short-range sniping like this.  Shoot indiscriminately at anything that moves, and even moreso at what does not move.  A sound tactical choice is to blindfire like in Gears of War, although the referees will get upset at you for being too good and will tell you to stop.  Stay in one place the entire game, and chances are you'll win.  If the impossible should happen, and you become the last man standing

When the other player gets angry at you

Congratulations! You've successfully made it through a game of paintball! Feel free to continue this to your heart's content.  Here are a few other tips to help you out:

-When your mask fogs up, and take off your mask and clean it.  You're safe where you are.
-Surrender rule is a suggestion.
-Grenades are the most useful thing you can buy.
-The more gear
-Call paint check whenever you totally hit someone.  Don't describe the player or his location at all
-The front trailer will screw you with gun rentals.  If your gun is misfiring
-Goggles are optional.  So are barrel plugs in the staging area.
-Pod belts are a waste of money.  Put paint in your pockets instead.
-Pick paint up off the ground
-Keep playing until a referee calls you out.  Fuck the honor system.
-Always argue with the referees.  The customer is always right.
-Never listen to rules or safety briefings. This stuff isn't complicated
-Complain to the boss. Always.
-Hold your gun sideways to shoot better.
-Longer barrel = better.  A 3 foot long barrel is deadly.
-Rapid fire is the way the professionals do it.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST:

You are the best player on the field

Enjoy!

1365518926.0,1bzpdi,RANT Post - Got lit up by kid shooting PSP Ramp Unlimited at point blank in the back,CDtothehizzle,62,15,101,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Was messing around on the field, not over shooting them, etc etc. I have good trigger control, so I shoot a few, they don't back up, shoot a few again. I get to their side of the field and I clear out their home bunker, As I'm dodging paint from my teammates and the enemy shooting at me now at their home, sneaks around behind me and lays 15 shots just around my kidney area. I look at him and yell WTF. I drop like a sack of rocks into the fetal position covering my head as the game is still going. I'm screaming obscenities just to control the pain. After a few minutes of just laying there

Later on I found out that the kid ( about 10 )

I'm guessing the kid likes to over shoot people on psp ramp. 

I was sitting in the staging area and the dad forces the kid to ask if I'm okay

The rage I was feeling to set my gun at uncap psp to just light the side of this little smirky kid's head was fueling so hard. I wanted to shoot him until he was crying and bleeding on the ground was so god damn badly. Downvote me for wanting to destroy a little kid with zero empathy that had no respect for the rules and no common sense. 

If I see this kid again

**TL;DR**

10 year old Kid shooting psp ramp unlimited (we checked his gun) shot me at around 4 feet right into my kidneys and back and did not have any remorse to the damage even if I had been a little kid. I will get revenge If I see this kid again.

The comradery; When you develop a bond with certain people, I WILL cover you. "" They KNOW that I am going to do my damnedest to put them there. . .  

The Adrenaline; I, I haven't even HELD an ACTUAL gun in 10+ years, BUT I would imagine that paintball is about as close you as you can get to it with out putting your life in actual danger. The amount my blood begins to pump as I start counting down from 5 in my head and then I hear that ""GO GO GO!"", or when it's down to just you against 3 opponents  is understood by few, and will be experienced by even fewer. . . 

FINALLY and most certainly not least. . . 

The mental clarity. . . When I am on that field, how much money I have in my bank account, or even how soul crushingly lonely I am. . . The ONE and ONLY thing on my mind is shooting out that person who is trying to shoot me out. It is almost as if time slows down, Everything happens in slow motion, You can see the individual paintballs in a rope right before you snap out to shoot back, screaming out the locations of opponents to your teammates, while listening to them shout out locations of guys you didn't know were there. . .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, but, I feel that this sub is kind of falling short on what it could be. I feel like we could, as a community, make this sub *the place* to be on reddit for an awesome paintball experience. People should want to come here to be entertained, discuss, and have a good time.

First off, I debate whether or not to check this sub because sometimes, there is absolutely nothing interesting going on. I feel that, as a player, I should always want to be checking on this sub no matter what. I know that this may be caused by the small amount of people here, but come on, 5700 people can provide more content than me do now!

I also want to talk about the subreddit in general. It might be nice to have more links in the sidebar

I think most of the problems we have here are caused by lack of participation (I'm not saying I provide tons of content or anything of the sort). I think it would be great to have more monthly contests like the action pic one. Possibly sexiest gun, or whatever you guys want, just so we can get the ball rolling and not stagnate in what we currently do. 

I think if we started to get more serious posts here about game discussion, and whatnot, that would be great! I would love to discuss speedball tactics here, especially with the higher up guys/gals to see what they know, but that almost never happens here. 

We might also want to make out Announcement at the top of the content list somehow more obtrusive to posting because without fail

Again

What do you guys think?

EDIT: I think the lack of different posts has caused all of the split subs that have popper up because people are trying to get more posts coming out instead of what we have now.

1335287957.0,sq88u,How I finally played paintball and what I learned the first time,,40,0,16,"I'll try to keep this short as I know reading walls of text can be boring. (Actually it doesn't look that short now

I've never wanted to play paintball because of the anticipation (and fear) of being shot by something whizzing by at high speed.  I think there is a natural survival instinct against standing in front of high velocity objects.

The only previous experience I had had with paintball was a bunch of us in middle school running around in the woods

Recently

For some reason I had this urge to get shot by it

I threw on the mask and turned around and had my friend shoot me twice in the back.  Felt sort of like a rubber band being snapped into my skin but...1000x less painful than I thought it would be. Pain fades in about 3-5 seconds

FEAR IS NOW GONE-Only took 15 years to man-up (I'm 25 now)

Fast forward a week or two

I feel like Rambo

My friends get all decked out in their crazy fancy gear


I look like a homeless man with a face-mask and a loincloth.

Badass.

We decide to do some 2v1 because there was no one else there.  The initial rush is pretty sweet

Crouching behind my first bunker while paint smashes into the backside emitting a satisfying thunk gets my adrenaline pumping, ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM"" and pull some Tropic Thunder Shit and start running down field spraying paint.   

Anyway, being exposed in the start of the game is just a death sentence.  

I got lit up quite a few times for moving up too fast too early.

I played a few Open Games and was demolished in short order

TL:DR

Things I learned:

* Paintball is insanely fun &amp; a good workout
* Being shot by a paintball is 1000x less painful than you imagine it will be
* I wore makeshift head, as it gave me confidence to not worry about exposing certain parts of my body.
* I'll probably get some form of knee pads in the future or padded pants
* Yell ""HIT"" loudly and slowly raise your gun/hand (I'm doing gun from now on).  A few times I raised my hand and it got shot to shit.  I was literally hit 3 times in the same skinny part of my hand while trying to notify people that I was out
* When you do ""get out"" don't walk in front of friendly fire.  One of those shots to the hands was from me walking right in front of a friendly player and getting hit from ~15 ft away.
* Don't be afraid to give a fist bump and commend people on ""nice shots"" as that is how you make new friends.  Granted
* Don't worry about looking ""cool"" and having the most badass and expensive gear.  Being safe and having fun is more important

That's about it...I encourage anyone on the fence to JUST DO IT

I have played alot over the past 15 years. It started in high school playing soccer

Since playing my first game of paintball a few weeks ago I have not experiance the level of comradery and friendly behaviour amonst sports players as I have in paintball.

Now this may be because im new and have not have heavy exposure to the sport

I had one guy willing to help as far as making a video on how to break down the gun to replace to O ring inside.

It makes me want to go out of my way to help other paintball players out.

I got my gun cheap from someone and i needed the rest of the gear. Because i was new i had some complete stranger give me pretty much everything i needed to play besides a mask. HPA tank/pod packs/pods/ hopper. And did it all for free.

After talking to him and a few others I have a idea why. I guess paintball people just want people to play with. THey want people to keep playing paintball and enjoy the sport they love.

Like golf paintball seems to be a game of honor. Calling yourself out when hit by a paintball.

While I know this is not like this everywhere it is a pleasent surprise. I know people cheat no matter what

I just want to thank everyone who so far has helped my first month of playing enjoyable

We found out that the gun was bought by this guy

Here is a post of a fellow PBNer (http://www.pbnation.com/showthread.php?t=3948773), AFTER HE SAID HE SOLD THE GUN LOCALLY!

Now the original owner of the gun went with police officers to TheNewEra's house

If anyone knows about anything

Also I should mention that here are the two threads that SD Notorious has up looking for players and having tryouts:

Some back story: My friends I play with are all Tippmann fans. They make fun of my ray gun-like markers and I tease them on the inordinate amount of weight they carry. However the only thing I wish my marker had was a one or two point sling. I don't want it all the time. However for large scenario events like ION where I may be standing around not doing anything for long periods of time

So looking for a way to put rails on the Axe

I had to cut the opening for the feedneck bigger. Also had to shave some of the tabs and thickness off the back of the rail kit. Other than that

I only use this for scenario events. Otherwise it is just 10 screws to take it off and then I use it normally. Enjoy.
