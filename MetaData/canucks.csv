I really like Cory Schneider as well. As a goaltender and a person. He's bright, I feel like it could be in the team's best interest to trade Cory, because a guy like him would have higher demand and a higher return.

I hope these games aren't Luongo's last in Vancouver. I would hate to see him go out playing great and falling short because the team can't score goals. 

Anyways, and our leader. Thanks for the dozens of great memories. Thanks for putting up with some terrible Vancouver media, and thanks for handling the goaltending controversy with nothing but class and a little humor.

It broke my heart that the city seemed to turn on him and demand he got railroaded out of town. Truth be told, and thats something a lot of lesser fans don't realize. But he's such a humble guy he shouldered the blame more times then he should. Like that fateful game 7 in 2011 when the Bruins blew 4 goals past him and the Canucks couldn't even score one. If he had even just let in one that night, they still would've lost.

The problem has never been Luongo

In New Jersey, for the rest of his career, through the thick and thin. Not another descent into mediocrity by milling through new goalies every 5 to 7 years.

Luongo is just what the doctor ordered when it comes to what Tortorella wants in his team, both men were at least past 38 when they achieved this.

The whole city and the rest of the Canucks fans better heed this: Its time you got behind Luongo and looked at him like a permanent fixture on the team until he's old enough to move on to other things. He's a great guy

- Injury and date sustained	

- Status/Updated	Notes

**David Booth**	 LW	 

*  Ankle	Out for the remainder of the regular season - 3/23/13	 
*  Booth will miss the remainder of the regular season after having surgery on his injured ankle. He could return during the playoffs


**Manny Malhotra**	 C	
 
*  Eye	out for season - 2/15/13	
*  Malhotra has been placed in the injured reserve due to a re-occurrence of visual symptoms stemming from the career-threatening eye injury he suffered last season. Out of concern for his on-ice safety and long-term health

**Chris Tanev**	 D	 

*  Leg 	D2D- 4/6/13	 
*  AV is aparently giving Tanev a couple days off

Looks like Luongo might be injured

1307638348.0,hvmy4,The time I sharpened Kirk McLean's skates and then robbed him.,,59,8,9,"Hopefully you guys get as much of a kick out of this story as I did when it happened.

So, I was working at a small sports shop on Broadway, G-Max Sports, maybe you've heard of it. Anyways, the owner was a pretty bulky guy who used to play for the Thunderbirds back in the day and would routinely head over to UBC to get games in with the other alums. 

So, sharpening skate after skate in the back, when the honing stone happens to slip. Sliced thumb, blood, bandage, good to go. I carry on with the skates as a customer walks in with a pair of his own. He starts chatting up Mike (the owner) and I can't shake the feeling that I've seen him somewhere before. He comes over to the back, comments on the bloody bandage, hands me his skates and takes off. I think nothing of it at the time

""Do you know who that was?"" he said.

""Uhhh

""That was Kirk McLean.""

""....wut?""

I had only ever seen a few pictures of him without his mask and I was only about 4 or 5 when they made their run in the '94 playoffs, if I do say so myself) sharpening.

Fast forward a month or so, trying to simultaneously keep all my fingers and not look awestruck while glancing over between passes. One night, about half an hour before closing, Mike says the *really* old timer alumni are missing one of their goalies and he asks if I wanted to fill in. I hadn't strapped on the pads in almost a year but I figured that they might as well get some use since I had brought them to Vancouver with the intention of playing. He gives me the time and location and I head home under the impression that I'll be playing against some geriatrics.

I get dropped off at around 8 pm and walk in to the arena, he's Asian, so it's hard to tell) and he lets me know that he'll be playing with the younger alumni. I'm kind of bummed, since he was the only person I knew there and I was about to get suited up in a dressing room full of hard-as-fuck guys in their 60s and 70s, but whatever, at least I'm getting on the ice.

I guess I was a bit early, and, in the back corner of the room, one Kirk Alan McLean. Captain Kirk is getting suited up (as a skater, not a goalie, mind you) to play on the same sheet of ice as me. Needless to say, I was beside myself. Not wanting to seem like an overeager superfan

After what seemed like ages of just making small talk with randoms while getting dressed (""Not bad"" ""Going to school for engineering"" ""SFU"" ""it's alright""), was I wrong, those guys could rocket the puck, put on a snipe show and still had the legs to motor down the ice. Meanwhile I'm rusty as all hell and my cardio is the shits. Needless to say, the score got run up on myself (rusty) and the other guy (old) and we decide to just stick to our own nets when teams switched sides. This is what allowed me to face shots from Kirk, which, given that he's known for being a goalie, deked the pants off me and set up some pretty good goals

I'm pretty active with my stick when I'm in net. I like to cut off passes, I can tell what he was going to do and block the path with my stick. He easily counters this with a perfect saucer pass that floats just over my blade....shit. So, as quick as I can, I spin out to face the shooter, but my attempt to block the pass put me in an awkward position. I haphazardly reel in my stick, drop down and, just as the guy in front shoots the puck to what he thinks is a wide open top, I throw out my blocker and rob him blind. Looking up

I never really amounted to much in my hockey-playing days, but I'll never forget the night that I made a huge save on Kirk McLean.

Yesterday's game. First game of the 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs between the L.A. Kings and Vancouver Canucks. The first of a widely anticipated playoff run for Vancouver, the Canucks played one of the worst playoff games I've seen in a while.

* Luongo was solid. In fact

* The amount of penalties the Canucks took killed off any momentum we had going. It's miraculous they even got 2 against Jonathan Quick - perhaps a testament to the quality of the team that they can sometimes pull off victories despite being dominated throughout the game. That wasn't the case last night.

* The ridiculous amount of diving was a joke. An absolute joke. We're known as a team with that tendency throughout the regular season, and Henrik for last night's ridiculous diving. Given how much the team has struggled on the PP, it's hard to imagine the point of trying to get a man advantage nowadays. You might as well play 5-on-5 and try to grind out some goals.

* The Kings forced the Canucks into playing their style of game. Aggressive. Hard-hitting. Gritty. The Canucks can't play like that. The team isn't built like that. Yet the game strategy, and hit anyone in your way. How that turned out was evidently shown by the amount of penalties taken by the Canucks in the game. With the team forced into a certain play-style, the Kings were able to turn the tables against us and dominate the entire game. Luongo saved our asses, especially early on. For the Canucks to succeed, they need to force the Kings into the Canucks game style. Cycling the puck, and pouncing on all offensive opportunities. Getting traffic in front is one thing, but when you take extremely weak, you're not going to score. Go back to the way we're used to playing

That's really all my thoughts about the first game. It was just a terribly played game by the Canucks, but it better be darn soon, or else the Kings might run away with the steal of the 1st round this year.

This subreddit right now is ridiculous with all of the ""trade Sedins/Burrows/Kesler/Bieksa"" talk. Will there be changes in the offseason? Yes. Most likely AV is fired. I don't think Gillis will be, and calling for trades involving the faces of the franchise is ridiculous. The Sedins not only represent the team, but they represent Vancouver as well. They cannot be traded, and they should not be traded, and the fickleness of our fanbase is astounding calling for their heads.

**Team History**

Notable Player #1: **Trevor Linden**, was team captain 1991-1997, and is arguably the most beloved player in the history of the franchise, for everything from his style of play, his ongoing community involvement, and his aw-shucks good looks. He also holds the #4 spot on the franchise scoring leaders ranking and his #16 was retired by the franchise in 2008.

Notable Player #2: **Stan Smyl**, having held the post for eight years (1982-90). At the time of his retirement he held the franchise record in every major statistical category, and his #12 was raised to the rafters in 1991. Like Linden, Smyl stayed active in the Vancouver community after retirement and remains a beloved figure.

Notable Player #3: **Markus Naslund**, which to this day is one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history. He quickly became an impact player and one-third of the very effective ""West Coast Express"" line alongside Todd Bertuzzi and Brendan Morrison, and in 2000 was named captain. His #19 was retired in 2010.

Notable Player #4: **Pavel Bure**, balancing speed and skill with an at times difficult personality. Though he left the team on bad terms after holding out on the last year of his contract until a trade was made with the Florida Panthers, his #10 is expected to be retired by the Canucks in the coming season.

Notable Player #5: **Kirk McLean**, prior to the acquisition of Roberto Luongo, the hands-down best goaltender in franchise history and the yardstick by which every other Canucks goaltender was measured and found wanting. He backstopped the team for ten years (1987-1998) and in 2010 was inducted into the Canucks' ""Ring of Honour"".

*Honourable Mentions: Thomas Gradin

**History**

The Vancouver Canucks entered the NHL as an expansion team in the 1970-71 season. They played in the Pacific Coliseum (presently home to the WHL’s Vancouver Giants) and wore the now familiar blue and green

The team struggled initially, mustard and black uniforms were designed for maximum aggression and energy, and aggressive they were; sports writer Jim Taylor wrote that the Canucks were “No. 15 in the standings and No. 1 on your retinas”.

Despite being universally reviled and objectively appalling, the installation of Pat Quinn as General Manager (1987), and the drafting of Trevor Linden (1988) and Pavel Bure (1989).

The nineties brought a turn for the better, and a slightly flukey Stanley Cup run in 1994. The series was intense and mismatched, pitting the Canucks against the New York Rangers; the Canucks won Game 1 in overtime largely due to a virtuosic 52-save performance by Kirk McLean, lost three in a row, and then won Games 5 &amp; 6, giving captain Trevor Linden the chance to earn his sainthood in the eyes of Canucks fans by scoring two goals, one on a shorthanded breakaway, screamed so loud in the trainer's room while receiving injections that they could hear him in the dressing room

The team moved from the Pacific Coliseum to the new General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena) following the lockout-shortened 1995 season. The late ‘90s ushered in some big names: Alexander Mogilny, and the free agent signing of Mark Messier in 1997 after negotiations failed with Wayne Gretzky the previous summer (just picture that for a minute).

The Canucks flat out blew in the seasons following their cup run, Keenan traded Trevor Linden, who had at the beginning of the season resigned his captaincy for Messier, to the New York Islanders in exchange for Todd Bertuzzi and Brian McCabe. While the trade was extremely unpopular given Linden’s fan-favourite status and the public personal issues between him and Keenan, Bertuzzi became a huge part of the Canucks’ success in the next decade and McCabe was more indirectly influential as part of a later trade. Brian Burke was hired as GM in the summer of 1998 and Keenan was fired midway through the 1998-99 season and replaced by Marc Crawford. Meanwhile, Pavel Bure was in the midst of his contract holdout and in January of 1999 was traded to the Florida Panthers in a seven player trade that included Ed Jovanovski. The team finished last in the Conference and received the 4th overall pick, which Brian Burke used (along with the aforementioned McCabe and a whole lot of other funky maneuvring) to acquire the 2nd and 3rd overall picks

The new millenium was good to the Canucks, and Naslund found some stellar chemistry and became the West Coast Express line. In 2002, Burke traded with the Capitals to bring Linden back to Vancouver.

In the 2003 playoffs the Canucks won their first playoff series in 8 years, Bertuzzi grabbed Steve Moore of the Avalanche from behind and punched him in the the head in retaliation for a hit Moore had made on Naslund in a prior game. Moore suffered a broken neck and a concussion from a combination of the punch, hitting the ice, and Bertuzzi landing on top of him. Bertuzzi was suspended for the rest of the season and postseason. That summer, Brian Burke was not renewed as GM and Dave Nonis was hired to replace him.

After the lockout, leading to the firing of Coach Crawford and the hiring of Alain Vigneault. Shortly thereafter, Bertuzzi was traded to the Panthers in exchange for Roberto Luongo. The personnel changes were highly successful, and Luongo was nominated for the Hart and the Vezina, but the Canucks lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Stanley Cup-winning Anaheim Ducks, which became something of a trend; the Canucks would lose to the Cup winners 4 out of 6 times between 2007 and 2012. 2008 marked the end of the Naslund era, as he left for New York due in part to issues with Vigneault’s coaching philosophy, resulting in Dave Nonis’ firing and the hiring of Mike Gillis to replace him as GM. Luongo was named captain

2011, and Daniel Sedin, Ryan Kesler, and Roberto Luongo all had career years, winning the Art Ross, Selke, and Jennings respectively. In the postseason, and finally defeated them with an overtime goal from Alex Burrows which led to the majestic call, however

The 2011-12 and shortened 2013 seasons were heavy with pressure to repeat 2010-11’s glories, resulting in 2013 in the firing of Alain Vigneault and the surprising trade of Cory Schneider to the Devils in exchange for their 9th overall selection in the 2013 draft, with which the Canucks selected Bo Horvat.

---

**Current Team**

Top player #1 - **Henrik Sedin**, and any given NHL player look like a wizard.

Top player #2 - **Daniel Sedin**, with 758. He is the triggerman to Henrik’s set-up man, and they may be psychic and/or speak some kind of dolphin language.

Top player #3 - **Ryan Kesler**, when healthy, one of the best two-way forwards in the league, and a key piece of the Canucks’ success in his tenure with the team, particularly in his special teams roles.

Top player #4 - **Dan Hamhuis**, leading the blueline in points last season with 24. Although not known for a dynamic offensive game, he's a very intelligent player on both ends of the rink and can always be relied on for a sweet outlet pass or a killer hip check.

Top player #5 - **Roberto Luongo**, but he has been consistently elite in his time with the Canucks, and will likely remain so for some time. Also, he’s hilarious on Twitter.

*Honorable Mention(s): Dan Hamhuis

**This Season**

* The Canucks lack forward depth

* The defence, assuming Chris Tanev, RFA, is signed.

* And the goaltending drama is finally sorted out

* Basically

---


**Rivals**

Biggest Rival - **Chicago Blackhawks**: Having faced each other in the playoffs three years in a row (2009-2011), don’t like each other. Throw in a few bad hits (Torres on Seabrook in 2011, Keith on Daniel Sedin in 2012) and baby, you’ve got a rivalry going.

Rival #2 - **Boston Bruins**: The hate is so strong with this one that it was created not with repeated playoff series, Rome concussed Horton with a late high hit, Boychuk broke Raymond’s back by driving him into the boards awkwardly, Marchand punched Daniel Sedin in the face six times and concussed Sami Salo with a low hit, and a lot of insults of varying validity were flung by fans (and presumably players). These kinds of things stick with a hockey fan.

Rival #3 - **Calgary Flames**: This one is a hate so long-standing it’s kind of difficult to even name any specific incidents that created it. Perhaps Vancouverites have always hated Calgarians

Rival #4 - **San Jose Sharks**: This one is fresh, we are terrible at losing. We hate it. It makes us angrycry and no one likes an angrycrier. Even worse is a sweep, because then those Bruins fans we’ve grown to hate make fun of our broom flair. Not cool.

*Honorable Mention(s): Los Angeles Kings

Other Notes:

This has nothing to do with rivalry, but **MARK MESSIER IS GARBAGE**. He is human tennis elbow, he is the pizza burn on the roof of the world's mouth, he is the opposite of Batman.

He is the *AT&amp;T of people*.

Mark Messier not only stole our Stanley Cup in 1994 when he *already had so many*, who is perfect in every manner. Then he took Wayne Maki's #11 which was unofficially retired in 1974 when Maki *died of brain cancer*. And then, just to put a bow on it, he proceeded to have the worst season of his career since 1979. And the team, which previously seemed to be one Mark Messier away from having it all, finished dead last in the division. A decade later he sued the team and received a $6 million settlement in further payment for three lousy seasons.

Messier is the worst.

## Game Notes:

* For the second year in a row - and just the second time in head coach Alain Vigneault's tenure as Canucks bench boss - Vancouver dropped their playoff opener on Wednesday falling 3-1 to the Sharks.

* Vancouver has won just one of their last eight playoff games dating back to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. They've also lost their last five straight home playoff games dating back to Game 7 of that Cup Final series.

* The Canucks have won just three of 12 all-time best-of-seven playoff series when losing the opening game. The last time they managed to feat was in their first round series against the Blues in 2003 when they dropped the series opener and then built a 3-1 series deficit before bouncing back and winning in seven games.

* For the second straight year – and the fourth time in their last five playoff series – the Sharks have jumped out to a 1-0 series lead. That advantage didn't do them much good last year however as

* The Sharks have won nine of 14 all-time series where in which they've won the opening game.

* The Canucks shuffled their forward lines at practice yesterday but as far as actual changes to the lineup goes all is expected to remain status quo both up front

* The Sharks did not shed much light on the statuses of injured forwards Martin Havlat and Scott Gomez following their practice yesterday. Gomez was a somewhat surprise scratch for Game 1 with an undisclosed injury while Havlat left Game 1 after playing just 3:16 with a lower body injury. The Sharks are already without D Jason Demers.

* Dating back to the regular season

* The Canucks come into tonight's contest having surrendered power play goals in three straight games dating back to the regular season. This is tied for their longest streak of consecutive games with a power play goal surrendered. They began the regular season giving up a power play goal in each of their first three games.

* Canucks D Kevin Bieksa's goal in Game 1 was his 10th career playoff goal – a goal that moved him into sole possession of first place on the franchise's all-time goals list among defenseman.

2.  Defensive-zone decisions:  The Canucks did a great job tonight of reading the play in the defensive zone.  There have been too many times in the past few games where we take possession in the defensive end and then try to force the puck through a high traffic area

3.  The Sedins:  For the first time this season, especially 5-on-5 and in the defensive zone.  Against the Avs, however, the Sedins were able to get their cycle game going and spent the majority of the time in the offensive end, thus creating scoring chances, and more importantly, keeping the puck 200 feet from Luongo.

What were the 'clutch' goals this playoffs for the Canucks?

1.  Burrows in OT eliminating the Hawks in Game 7
2.  Kesler scoring with seconds left to send it to OT in Game 5 against the Sharks
3.  Bieksa's odd bounce in 2OT to win that game and eliminate the Sharks.
4.  Burrows scores off the face-off in OT in Game 2 of the Final.

Seems like a toss up.

Hank was winning faceoffs

Cory was solid

4th line was doing exactly was a 4th line needs to do: Control the puck deep

Defence was solid.

Powerplay looked great.

Also:

Hank on the PK? What? He did well though

Derek Roy makes such a difference to our team, I'm excited to see our lineup with everyone back in it.

## Game Notes:

* The Canucks didn't exactly end their regular season on a high note dropping a 7-2 decision in Edmonton on Saturday night. They closed out their regular season losing back-to-back games. They have not lost more than two in a row since a four-game winless skid from March 3 to 10.

* The Sharks, they would have earned themselves a date with the St. Louis Blues instead.

* The Sharks dominated the Canucks in the season series winning all three head-to-head meetings. The closest the Canucks came to knocking off the Sharks was a 3-2 shootout loss on home ice back on March 5.

* In 185 minutes of hockey played between the Canucks and Sharks this season

* The Canucks had never lost their opening game of the playoffs under head coach Alain Vigneault until last year when they fell 4-2 to the Kings last year in their playoff opener.

* Based on how the Canucks skated at practice the last two days, D Cam Barker, D Derek Joslin and D Keith Ballard.

* The Canucks are hoping that G Cory Schneider will be good to go for tonight's contest after sitting out the last two regular season games with an undisclosed injury. Schneider declared himself ready following yesterday's practice but head coach Alain Vigneault indicated the final decision would not be made until the morning of game day.

* Sharks workhorse G Antti Niemi

* It remains to be seen whether G Roberto Luongo will factor into this series but

* This entire first round series will be broadcasted on TSN which is a good sign for the Canucks. Vancouver went 5-0-1 when appearing on TSN during the regular season.",self,t5_2qrs7,1367447459.0,,2007b,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/1dhswz/game_thread_san_jose_sharks_00_at_vancouver/

## Game Notes:

* The Canucks are coming off a heartbreaking 3-2 overtime loss in Game 2 and now face a tremendous uphill climb if they hope to get back into this series and win it. The Canucks squandered a late 2-1 third period lead when Patrick Marleau evened the game with 56 seconds remaining in regulation before ex-Canuck Raffi Torres put the final dagger into their hearts with the OT winner 5:31 into the first extra session.

* Vancouver has lost three straight playoff games dating back to last year and has just one playoff win in their last nine post-season outings dating back to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. They've also lost six straight playoff home games dating back to 2011.

Alex Burrows

""It's in the back of our minds, but I'm good at keeping my emotions in check.""

The Canucks, first overall in the NHL for the second straight season, is attempting to become the fourth team in Stanley Cup history - 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders and 2010 Philadelphia Flyers - to rally from a 3-0 deficit.

""It's a little different, we're more than willing to do it.""

Coach Alain Vigneault put Kesler

Lapierre has served mainly as a third and fourth-liner since being acquired from the Anaheim Ducks at the trade deadline last season. But he has played more of a top-six forward role recently

Before arriving in Vancouver

""He's been told to shut up and play

Kesler and Burrows played together early in their careers. However

""Playing with (Kesler) and watching him for the last seven,"" Burrows said. ""You know once the puck's through that neutral zone he wants to skate with it and he wants to make plays and shoot it. He's a great player, and we'll try to have one of our best games.""

Burrows said the line will try to take advantage of Kesler and Lapierre's speed and ability to get in on the forecheck.

""As a line,"" Burrows said. ""The most important thing is to win the game.""

Lapierre said Burrows and Kesler bring a lot of skill to the unit. He will just try to create room for them by being physical so that they can put the puck in the net.

""We just have to keep things simple

The Canucks want to remain disciplined after getting into penalty trouble earlier in the series. As a result

""Our role has not always been to go out there and talk

The creation of the new unit comes as Vigneault continues to try to generate more offense. The playoffs are usually a time for unsung heroes

""At this point,"" Vigneault said. ""We got that from Schneids (goalie Cory Schneider) last game and got it from a couple of other guys. If we want our season to continue, we're going to need more guys doing that also.""

Vigneault confirmed Schneider will make his third straight start in goal.

## Game Notes:

* Season series: The Canucks are making their first visit of the season to Pepsi Center. They blanked the Avalanche 3-0 in Vancouver on Jan. 30 and have won the last eight games between the teams.

* The Canucks are coming off a gritty 1-0 win at Los Angeles on Saturday -- a game they found a way to win despite icing an injury-depleted group of forwards. The Avalanche are glad to be back home after a 5-2 loss at Dallas on Saturday night,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,2007b,t3_1ax3jg

Now, but they were just given a little extra motivation. Rome is loved in that lockerroom, remember the celebration when he [**scored his first goal as a Canuck**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpiNFQQTHlk)?

The second key thing is that the Bruins players have nothing to complain about anymore. True, Stanley Cup Final games must be worth 3 or 4 regular season games. 

The other thing is that there is now no player to target for retribution. We don't have to worry about Rome getting flattened by a cheap shot in this series anymore. The incident is behind us now and we can move on and play this series. Additionally

## Game Notes:

* The Canucks are looking to extend their win streak to a season-high four straight games. They are also looking to win consecutive games on the road for the first time this season.

* The Wild are coming off back-to-back regulation losses for the second time this season. They are looking to avoid equaling their longest winless streak at the season at three games.

* The Canucks won four of the six head-to-head meetings against the Wild in last year's season series but they lost two of the three games they played at the Xcel Energy Center and were out-scored by a combined 9-6 score there.

* Canucks G Cory Schneider will pick up his fifth start of the season tonight. He hasn't seen any game action since two Sundays ago in a 4-1 road loss to the Sharks.

* The Canucks last visit to the Xcel Energy Center on March 19 – also their last head-to-head meeting against the Wild – resulted in a 2-0 loss. Schneider was nearly perfect that night stopping 32 of 33 shots.

* Canucks G Roberto Luongo

* Canucks F Daniel Sedin led all players in the season series last year with three goals and 10 points.

* Canucks F Jordan Schroeder, will play at the Xcel Energy Center for the first time as an NHLer tonight although he's had plenty of experience playing there in the past while with the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.

* The Wild are expected to shake up their lines taking Heatley off the top unit alongside Parise and Koivu and moving rookie Charlie Coyle up in his spot. Heatley would drop down to play with Bouchard and Cullen.

* Ex-Ranger F Mike Rupp is expected to make his Wild debut tonight. He was acquired by the Wild on Monday in exchange for Darroll Powe and Nick Palmieri. Rupp is joining his sixth NHL team following previous stops in New Jersey, Pittsburgh and New York.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,2007b,
