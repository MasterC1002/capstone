1367951394.0,1dvkzd,The Royal d'Isigny Tapestry,2407895246098234,366,30,49,"My Lords and Ladies

The great Norman Family of d'Isigny have commissioned a royal tapestry of their family's history. The realms greatest weavers of Syria, Greece, and Serbia have come together to weave a phenomenal piece.

It shows the reign of each ruler and their achievements.

In celebration of a strong family line of d'Isigny I present the royal tapestry.

Peasant! Fetch me the Link!

*****

**[d'Isigny Tapestry](http://i.imgur.com/NMpGkvd.jpg)**

*****

*Now to briefly mention before I explain each scene

*As a devout Catholic family
*****
1. **Talbot I** | The first d’Isigny to sail the treacherous seas with his Normans and rule in Aintab. Above we witness the “Eastern Star” that brought them here.


2. **Serlo I** | Known as “Magnus (the great)”


4. **Henry I** | A warrior King; though only maimed at the battle of Symeon


5. **Henry II** | Shown laying in his deathbed. “Breves”


6. **Torf I** | The Unyielding Holy Warrior


7. **Faramond I** | “Prodita (betrayed)” his reign is shown during the great rebellions. People cower in fear and dread.


8. **Henry III** | A sad scene in which he watches the “Great Invasions” and the Ilkhanate Hordes


9. **Oswulf I** | The Kinslayer


10. **Nadbor I** | The last of Syrian Kings


11. **Henry IV** | Sails to Frankish lands and joins the Crusade for Sicily. Crowned the first King after a magnificent victory. A sign is seen in the sky


12. **Hugh I** | The Seafarer


13. **Bertan I** | Warrior King. Only seen on the battlefield


14. **Turold I** | The King who struggled with the Frankish Emperor Berneger. He commanded the largest armies and waged colossal wars. It is said he ruled the lands with his Danish Axe.


15. **Eustache I** | First King of Serbia and celebrated as a liberator by the Serbian people.


16. **Turold II** | Reconquered many lost territories. Many say he lived in a large tower to see his distant lands. After the death of his wife Navar


17. **Eustache II** | Finest Warrior King

Everyone will tell you to start your first game in **Ireland**.  We call it Tutorial Island for a reason: you should be able to create the Kingdom of Ireland before England starts to mess with you.  I recommend the count of (I think) Dublin in 1066: his father dies soon, I went from Irish count to Emperor of Britannica, which is a nice goal for a starting player.  

For a game of vicious backstabbing and incest, united Muslim enemy, but the King of Portugal starts with a ton of children and bastards, so you can get alliances very quickly.  

If you want to conquer the world

For a different challenge, a good relationship with the HRE, and you can steal a lot of land from the pagans very quickly.  It's fun to be emperor of the north.  

Advanced Starts:
1066 **Abyssinia**: people seem to think this is the hardest start, you start as a Christian heresy surrounded by muslims, without any research.  It's pretty fun.

January 2nd 1255 **Golden Horde**.  For some reason

These are the ones I remember

Edit: I'd like to get a good list of character starts for the side-bar.

**1. [Fast inviting](http://i.imgur.com/EKLZ6Hf.gif).**

**Why?** You can do this to invite to a plot or to invite claimants or any other case where you have a list and want to access several character's diplomacy sheet.

**How?**  Right-click character portrait. Left-click diplomacy button. Repeat for each character.

**2. [Fast diplomacy](http://i.imgur.com/BJr1ld6.gif).**

**Why?** Some say it's faster. I'm not sure.

**How?** Right-click character portrait. Right-click diplomacy button. Multiple buttons will pop up

**3. [Special interest](http://i.imgur.com/1h1DeXh.gif)**

**Why?** By taking a special interest in someone

**How?** Right-click character portrait. Right-click personal button. Three buttons will pop up

**4. [Fast new vassal](http://i.imgur.com/cwcBqdQ.gif)**

**Why?** Most likely you just won a holy war and got an entire county with all the bishoprics and baronies and now you got the ""Wrong holding"" alert button.

**How?** Select the county. Right-click the holding. Left-click the crown to create a new vassal.

**5. [Pick a good marriage/betrothal](http://i.imgur.com/Usg2A6i.png)**

**Why?** You want good stats or an alliance or obtain claims.

**How?** Character finder

**6. [Side panel](http://i.imgur.com/ZRvG9s0.png)**

Use it. It is so much easier to change your camera position

**7. [Manage your messages](http://i.imgur.com/sYlDkag.png)**

You don't need every event to pop-up and/or pause the game. You can disable these pop-up notifications by clicking [the small letter symbol in the lower right corner](http://i.imgur.com/FC86uNx.png).
On the other hand you can alter the behavior of every event that either shows up in [the message log](http://i.imgur.com/uD0o53X.png) or in [the priority tabs](http://i.imgur.com/ur1Lm4Q.png) by right clicking it.
Disabled notifications can be accessed [via the side panel](http://i.imgur.com/1SLdx70.png).

**8. Shortcuts**

You must use hotkeys at a certain point, position mouse over green upgrade button and left-click &gt; ENTER &gt; ""."" (which is the next province and "","" the previous) &gt; Repeat.

There are several predefined shortcuts which you already know

First you need to locate your ""interface"" folder

There are several *.gui files which can be opened in your favourite editor (e.g. Notepad++).

 When you find a ""guiButtonType"" String followed by a name = ""button_something"" it's a good indication that you can set up a shortcut. Let's look at a example:

Example: Raise army of selected province:

-Open province.gui

-Search for ""raise_levy""

-Add shortcut = ""z""

		guiButtonType =	{
			name = ""button_raise_levy""
			position = { x=181 y=354 }
			quadTextureSprite =""GFX_military_troop_strip_1""	
			Orientation = ""UPPER_LEFT""
            shortcut = ""z""
		}

You can bind to a uppercase letter if you want SHIFT+$letter behaviour or use identifiers like LEFT.

After watching S03E09 of Game of Thrones, the Crossing, and the Riverlands.

**Then the Aztecs invaded.**

I was confused at first, with foreign titles, sigils, and unpronouncable names.  Next, I felt naively hopeful that I could ally myself with the new foreign power, so I married my sister to their leader... The next emotion I felt was fear.

Fear at the fact that 200,000 troops.  It was all I could do to survive.

40 years later, and the Vale, as well as 4 territories in the north.  The Westerlands fell immediately, as the Aztec horde landed right in Lannisport.  They then swept westward, taking bits of the reach with them on the way across the Riverlands and Harrenhall, up through the Vale. They finally ransomed my sister back to me - blinded, tortured

The Iron throne became a joke

It wasn't until 60 years later, which means it didn't regenerate like levies did.  Observing this, King Harwin started war after war, sending tens of thousands of men to slaughter at the hands of the Aztecs, and then making peace.  The horde, only 100,000 strong at this point,000.... 60

The Aztec empire remained for a time, and they only control a few scattered territories in the reach, and a few in the vale.  The rest is the Iron Throne, with the Starks in power, at least 15 generations since the Young Wolf.  

The most striking thing about the invasion is how affected everyone's ethnicity.  Now, and the Tyrells have Aztec features and titles.  The pagan religion of the Aztecs is still prevalent, and the cause of much civil war in the heart of Westeros.  Also, the Starks all have the silvery hair and purple eyes of house Targaryen, starting with King Harwin.

This game is awesome. You know that already if you are reading this

I've been playing video games since 1983... yep, I know a little bit about video games. The two games that I've played the most are by far the Civilization series and close second Diablo II. I used to play the original Civilization  all night long when I was a student only to go to college in the morning to keep playing there. I've played Civ II, III and IV, the Total War series... I've played them all. I love strategy games, but I also love and play much more casual games, like sports (NFL, F1, Skyrim

Last Christmas. I was thinking to myself ""dude... I really miss a good strategy game... but I don't really feel like installing Civ IV or Medieval 2... again"". So when I saw CK2 on sale on Steam

Big disappointment. I started the game and was like WTF? The tutorials are confusing as hell, how to ""conquer"" territories or build units, and worst of all, I didn't really get the ""pause/play"" mechanics, I'm so used to the turn based paradigm that I really felt lost.  So I said, fuck this, and the game went to gather dust during months.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I saw some ad for the upcoming expansion and I said, I went for it..

Being a native Castillian I decided to start as a Conde there ... only to see my ass raped by the moors in a few years. But this time I had fun as I started to ""get"" the game, so nothing to object here.

My 2nd game I decide to follow the general advice and started as an Irish count. This time I managed to unite almost the whole island and create the kingdom of Ireland. Then, the glorious king of Ireland, ended up being the vassal of some drunkard captain motherfucker. 2nd lesson learned: mercenaries are called mercenaries for a reason.

But it was awesome. Usually when I put la lot of effort in a game and I lose... I rage quit. I once threw my controller against the wall playing Dark Souls, wow, that was awesome. I didn't feel like losing but like witnessing a plot twist in a historical interactive soap opera. I played some more years but I didn't manage to get my kingdom back.

There was a 3rd game, and a 5th...  And I'm having a blast everytime. I'm hooked to it. This a seriously addictive game. I can't stop it, I play every minute of my free time. It's been years since I've been so hooked to a videogame.

And I was thinking... what is it? What's about this game that I like it so much? Well, it's not even about grand strategy in the strict meaning of the term, it's about history and stories, it's the most literary game I've ever played (I love reading), the plots that unfold in every game could fill a shelve of Shakespearean dramas.

That's all. This game is awesome.

After playing the game for about 300 years, Spain and Carpathia, I thought I was sitting pretty making 130 gold a month with 5,000 in the bank. How wrong I was.

Looking for new targets to add to my empire

I *must* have it.

I didn't have the BC to attack him with though

I looked through his family

A small gift later, Provence doesn't join my empire when he inherits.

Next

Second attempt succeeds! Slobby is now the richest man in Europe and my vassal. All I have to do is banish him

I make him court jester. It's not enough. Then an idea occurs: operation Pope Bomb.

With the new Pontiff as my vassal

His forces are weak compared to an empire

With several counties and two duchies to his name (in addition to the tyranny penalty)

I needed a new plan. Looked again at his family tree - a young daughter is his sole heir

All that's left between me and 131, more than anyone else on earth. Even more than his father. He knows I killed his family. He knows he's next. He knows.

I didn't want to take another opinion hit

Six months later

Turns out Slobby is not as dumb as he looks

A year later

All the scheming paid off: I got back all the lands I gave away, with only a fraction of the popularity hit compared to banishment. My vassals are ok with it overall, as they got their taxes reduced.

**tl;dr - inviting the richest vassals in the world to your court


So,000+ gold. Are there other ways in the game to claim that gold, or can it only be done through complicated inheritance schemes like above?

1368463725.0,1e94ct,"Enough is enough, HRE! A moment I'm proud of.",SkumbagAce,111,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1e94ct/enough_is_enough_hre_a_moment_im_proud_of/

I'm playing as the Eastern Roman Empire (I use TPATT) and married my dude to a woman with a claim on Hungary. After a war she became the Queen and Empress of the ERE. Twenty years later we've had a ton of children and all when suddenly I recieve a call to arms. I thought it was just another one of those transylvanian lords that wants to take the throne.

I was wrong. 

So very wrong.


It was the Holy Roman Empire that had decided to go to war for a claim on Sopron. usually I wouldn't give a damn about such a small country (let alone my wife's) but since it was the HRE I decided enough's enough. Too many times has the HRE been able to bully everyone to give it what it wants.

I accepted the call to arms.

I raised my 50K troops and decided it was time for war. I immediately put 35k of my troops on ships and decided to destroy the shoreline of the HRE down around Cote D Azur and Tyrrhenian Sea which went quite succesfully. Unloading troops in 5'ks they immediately started conquering the southern shore of the HRE.


Meanwhile the HRE had sent its massive forces to Hungary for what they though would be a quick and easy war. Afterall

Their forces destroyed my Wife's without as much as blinking which I had expected. I sent my other 15K troops up to Hungary to help her hold stand which I quickly found was useless. The HRE send massive 20k's and 15k's and decided it was time to fuck around after it had beaten my Wife's forces and now laid siege to Hungary and picked off my 7/8k army blobs with relatively ease. I imprisoned the Emperor's son which I was satisfied with as the HRE kept on sieging Hungary.


Denmark decided to join HRE's side which I really didn't care about - Fuck Denmark. Petty little nation. Luckily for me

Poland didn't have many forces but the AI suprised me here. Instead of the usual suicide attack

The warscore was at 5% in favor of the HRE. A good ammount of Hungary was conquered and under siege while I had taken a good part of the southern HRE when the Kaiser dies in battle. Its former capitol was in the heart of the HRE where I'd never dare to move my troops

The war was in my favour as he had to go through a river crossing AND I'm ontop of a hill so after a lenghtful fight I emerged victorious with 3k troops left while having devastated the 13k blob leaving it with 4.5k demoralized troops who quickly went away.

While I had blitz'd the capitol of Blamont

Despite the siege on Hungary

The war went on and I had taken the southern HRE while Hungary was quite smashed. I decided to send 1000 gold to my wife to see if she'd hire mercenaries but the AI fucked me over and she didn't. With my remaining 1.5k gold I decided to hire mercenaries to bring some of Hungary back into my wife's control when my wife suddenly dies of illness.

My competent heir now became King of Hungary and took me by suprise. He had married a child off to Sweden which caused Sweden to be called in the war and now 12k troops from Sweden came down to bring salvation to Hungary and death to the HRE.

Sweden had taken back a good deal of Hungary as a lot of the HRE's troops had died to attrition after this long war as the supplies had gone down.

The warscore came to 45% in favor of me and my wife when my son suprised me yet again. In personal combat he slayed the Emperor of the HRE and the Emperor of the HRE got a new kaiser.

This kaiser was slightly incompetent and immediately 2 wars for independence broke out in the HRE which devastated the HRE further.


My son enforced his demands and became the victor with me. 

Limberg


After 6 years of war the HRE got crushed because I stood up to it and decided enough was enough.

I just felt like sharing this since I'm rather proud of my accomplishment to defend my wife and later son's land against the HRE which ended up it being crippled and crumble from within.

tl'dr; Stand your ground against the HRE. Don't let the bullies win.",self,t5_2tgic,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1e94ct/enough_is_enough_hre_a_moment_im_proud_of/

I like this method as I get to play with different chars all the time. Also getting a king or duke is more likely as they usually have more than one province

The way I understand it, I assume I'm flirting with the highest chance possible.  Am I right in thinking that having two parents with genius traits means that each kid will have around a 27.75% chance of inheriting it (15% inheritability roll, firing once for each parent)?  If that's the case, as long as the inbred chance is like 25% or less, it's probably worth a shot.  Also, does marrying your sibling carry any other penalties (church or vassal opinion hit, etc)?

**Edit:** I should mention that another potential motive for doing this would be to reduce the likelihood of a succession crisis, but who knows.

**Edit 2:** I understand that the chance that the inbred trait is inherited is 25%, whether such a union is more likely to generate children with just the inbred trait or just the genius trait.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,1375741921.0,roman-empire,

I was able to crush both of them and started to take hold of Scotland's captured territories. The HRE had refused my call to aid the war, to ensure the passing of the throne before any unfortunate deaths ruined my arrangement, the King was executed, passing his crown to his daughter, and my Heir's new wife.

It's the triad of 

1) **desire

2) **promise and**

3) **fulfillment of promise.**

At this moment, etc. But what if you could **promise them a situation that they desire?**

For example, you promised this spymaster a duchy after the plot is executed? This might change his point of view entirely. However you'd then have a traitorous and probably ambitious duke in your realm who has a high Intrigue. (Of course, should his relations with his liege be really high, only huge promises would make him change sides, e.g. a kingdom or an incredible sum of money).

Another example: you want to ask the Pope for an invasion

What if you break a promise? First of all

What it boils down to technically **(skip this list if you don't care about the technicalities):**

1) Characters should have Desires. They currently have ambitions and desire titles (also there are 'Political concerns', money, etc.). The Desires should be weighted based on their relevance and current situation.

2) When proposing a deal or inviting to a plot, 'Character D has been given a sum of N by character E'. The Promise should affect the character's disposition toward the current deal. However, he or she should consider whether the required goal is attainable.

3) After the goal that required the Promise is attained

4) If the situation doesn't occur

5) If the goal isn't attained

I realize that this system may not be easy to implement or mod in

But think of the possibilities! **For example:**

* Playing as William the Conqueror and promising riches and titles to English nobles who turn to your side. 

* Dividing a weak HRE among France

* Getting the crown of Rus by backstabbing your brothers.

* Inviting spymasters to plots by promising them untold riches

* Playing as Iberain muslims

* Playing as a Russian duke under Golden Horde and creating an alliance to overthrow the Mongols. (By promising other strong dukes large parts of territory; also

* On that note: inviting foreigners to your rebellion against your liege by promising them land. How much of your homeland are you willing to sacrifice to get the desired title?

* Also

* Recruit councillors from abroad by promising them positions in the council (thanks to /u/justamathnerd)

* Etc.

*TLDR* (I realised I have just created a massive wall of text so I'll put this up the top): I stopped saving and had my most interesting game so far. Instead of being a massive blob as usual after 150 years

In my current game

I started off as a Count in Norway, I have dealt with many game-ending situations, but the reign of Queen Asta I 'The Fat' of Italy had to take the cake. 

Asta's grandfather Egil created the Kingdom of Italy, with his son Hakon, a 16 year old diligent kind strong Brilliant Stategist, betrothed to the heir of the Byzantine Empire, inheriting the throne. Everything was coming up roses, until at age 20 he was unceremoniously assassinated, with no children as his betrothed was still under age.

So who was first in line for throne? Hakon's slothful glutonous 10 year old younger sister

970: Hakon I dies childless

974: Asta gives birth to a daughter

976: Second daughter born

977: Succession crisis finally ends

977: King of Aquitaine presses his claim to Italy. Asta surrenders immediately as her levies have been devastated by the succession crisis

979: Third daugher born

980: Asta excommunicated at the request of her aunt

981: Fourth daugher born (succession laws were Gavelkind

982: During a war to lower crown authority in Aquitaine, and Asta gets the crown of Italy back (less the Sicilian holdings)

982: Immediately following the reacquisition of her independence, and gets her excommunication lifted. The casus belli becomes void (with war score at 95%)

983: King of Aquitaine presses his claim on the Kingdom of Italy and Duchy of Latium. Before he is able to bring his allies the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Asturias into the war

984: King of Aquitaine surrenders the war

985: Asta I dubbed 'The Fat'

986: Aquitaine's Norse Sicilian vassals rebel. Asta joins the war

987: Succession crisis in Aquitaine

988: Asta gives birth to her first born son

What many people miss is that of all the good genetic traits

Howso you ask? Most people's experiance with attractive is modest. Their male ruler gets a freebie +1 diplomacy. Yay... Nothing to complain about

In addition to the previously mentioned +1 diplomacy, bonus: a +30 ""Attraction to:"" relationship bonus to adult males (and homosexual females). 

This is a global bonus. All vassals, rulers of other nations and even the freaking pope! +30  to them all for free for life. 

The implications of this are HUGE since 95% of the people in power are male. 

1. An attractive female rising to the throne is much less likely to suffer from revolts
2. Once her reign is established
3. The buffer in vassal opinion allows you to run harsher levy/tax laws and reap their full benefits. 
4. Bishops are more likely to give YOU their taxes and levies rather than the pope. 
5. You can carry more of a tyranny penalty without destabilizing your realm
6. You are more likely to find people willing to join your plots
7. Foreign rulers are somewhat less likely to attack you due to their generally higher opinion.
8. Allies are more likely to come to your aid when called into war.
9. You are less likely to be excommunicated by the pope, rather than kissing the pope's rear. 
10. If you are in elective
11. You are unlikely to be killed via plot as many people will be unwilling to join a plot against you.
12. Claimants are more likely to accept an invitation to your court.
13. Allies of your enemies are less likely to join them in a war against you. 
14. Changing major laws (crown authority) and/or succession laws becomes easier when all your vassals like you.

Starting as the count of Urgell in 1066

After several decades of trading bows with the independent muslim counts, then the kingdom of Aragon.

During this time, and the other half being bred into christian andalusians.

Eventually, the one who will later be known as Sultan Berenguer-Ramon the first. Initially born as a catalan, he was tutored by an andalusian relative, ending up as an andalusian.

By 1125, amidst broken truces, assasinating the Jimena rulers that had the very annoying tendency to ball up, and meddlesome French and Pisan imperialists conquering provinces I had dibs on! (The game does not recognize the very elaborate tagging system of ""I saw that province first, fuck off"", so I had to *accidentally* kill some of the more expansionist rulers.)

One of my first measures as a Sultan was to establish an Antipope...this had the very (un)fortunate side-effect of turning the HRE to the Waldesian heresy. I thought nothing of it...until it got ANGRY and started kicking everybody in the shins. France was plunged into civil war and split between Aquitaine and France...Poland was quickly subdued by the HRE, snorting HRE.

This

The artificer of this was Sultan Tifilwit d'Urgell the first, he had crazy stats, and no bad traits except his shyness. (I am very certain that later historians will have said that he was so imposing that he didn't need to speak.) During his reign, he created the Kingdoms of Andalusia, Leon, Castille, Galicia and Portugal

During his time

Nevertheless, claiming southern Aquitane, and western Burgundy.

And then died, or whatever. Suffice it to say that she was a Norse pagan.

She created the Empire of Hispania, jihading, they arrived in very small numbers, allowing the new Empress to crush them quite handily, and in the process, pass the time so the opinion penalty of short reign+female ruler to diminish.

At one point, it just so happened that the King of Hungary died (which I had no part in! Honest!), and then the Empress, on a whim, decided to invade Hungary on behalf of her kinswoman, the 2-year old Naila, daughter of the Jarl of Tolouse.

Long story short

The next few rulers stuck to a tried and true recipe. Badshah Garsiya I  opened two more fronts, standard recipe. Assassinate leaders, induce civil war, declare conquest of multiple counties at a time, inch across the map.

Empress Dima the Holy opened up a front in Italy too

Here's a screenshot

Yadda yadda, Ireland, Scotland, Mauretania, Italy, Poland and Armenia at the same time. When HRE was waving a civil war, shave a couple of counties from their fat corpse too. (I was wary of entering a direct conflict, because factions were getting pretty big.)

Ultimately, kept getting into factions and slapping his neighbors. He began inching into Poland, and Bavaria and Serbia and Austria. I got annoyed at his indiscretions (and his fat 30% relative power), so I imprisoned him and banished him. 

BAD. BAD. BAD. -350 tyrant modifier. The Empire was plunged into civil war

Ultimately, Castille, Ireland, Scotland, Armenia, Mauretania, Mali, Bavaria(MORON

The end date was about 1325. I still held Aragon, Leon, Aquitaine, France, Hungary, Croatia and Italy before the tyrant modifier got down to manageable levels...so it wasn't a COMPLETE disaster, since I still had more army than pretty much everyone except maybe the Fatimids and the Ilkhanate.

However, I did not feel like going through the whole motions to conquer everything AGAIN, so I called it a day.

Basking in my victory and torrent of notifications, I take a look at the rest of the world. The Iron Islands have split up the Riverlands, but otherwise, everything looks not much different from the de jure kingdoms. After a couple years of peace (barring the occasional revolt or title falling out of kingdom), suddenly the Kingdom of the North collapses. I decide to take advantage of the situation and invade. Most of my allies are rebelling against the new Stark king, so I call them in to support my invasion. As my army marches towards Winterfell, but just before they catch up, so I wait to end the war until I sack Winterfell. In the meantime

THE QUEEENINDANORFF! I move my capital from Thenn to Winterfell and give my rival brother the titles he wanted as well as the Wall so I stop getting spammed with notifications. Seeing the Riverlands are still so broken up and with my ""wildling invasion"" CB being so useful, but eventually they are conquered too, allowing me to crown myself Iron Queen.

The remaining kingdoms fall like dominoes, then wait. Iron Queen Brynnhilde lives to be 84 despite constant assassination attempts, has eight children and conquered the entire map in a single lifetime. Her son, Iron King Siegfried is a genius attractive greenseer with decent stats and beloved by my vassals. Everything looks stable, so I decided to just wait until Aegon's landing and see if I can fight him off with a unified Westeros. Unfortunately my game crashed a few years later and the last save I have is from right after I conquered the North (for some reason autosave gets disabled whenever I start a modded game).

21 January

The LORD teaches us to honour our parents—not to love them. Father is dead; good riddance

I am [Serlo d'Isigny, a godless Armenian heretic. How can someone bear to be godless *and* a heretic? The mind reels.

The LORD teaches us to be fruitful and to multiply; this I have not yet done. Father forbade me and my two youngest brothers from marrying, to that deceitful [Princess Adalmode](http://i.imgur.com/cdeDyXF.jpg) of France! How angry that made me! *We're the same age!*

For years I had heard whispers of a beautiful young woman in the faraway court of the Emperor. Now that I am a ruler in my own right, at last will be my bride.. as well as my stepmother. Why father ever thought he could be the right man for her is beyond me, especially considering his advanced age. Thankfully they never consummated the marriage.

***

6 February

The wedding is a quiet affair; this pleases the LORD. It is nonetheless a boon to my prestige that I did not accept Royal Aid Duty. At long last

After the wedding, to my apartment within the castle. They're both sinners in the eyes of the LORD: Tybalt is proud of his gluttonous ways and Turstin is a cruel little liar. What's worse, they're both Armenian dogs. This castle isn't *that* small, but I have had the good fortune to grow up in the Norman wing of the castle... while my youngest brothers have not. Yet they're still family; the family line must continue somehow. Perhaps I can see to it that their children are raised as proper Normans.

I inform Tybalt that he has been betrothed to [Princess Pernette of France](http://i.imgur.com/SEANmpR.jpg)

**The Diary of Duke Svein af Reddit**

[15 September

First, because I'd like to start having sons pretty quickly. I'm going to focus a bit on diplomacy, especially this early on in my reign. I decide to marry a Norwegian princess who has good genes, and a nice and powerful father.

[25 September

Alright, though, does not like me and is also pretty under-qualified. His skill in diplomacy leaves a lot to be desired. I'm going to keep an eye out for people of higher skill to invite in, as I'll want to fabricate some claims. For now, though, I'll give my chancellor the task of keeping relations up – because I haven't reigned long, and also because I am a foreigner

[26 November

I suspect my subjects do not like my high tax rates. I'd like to begin focusing on building up the infrastructure in my own holdings as well as pressing my de jure claim on the Isle of Man soon

[29 July

Independence faction formed already. I need to appease my people

[29 August

Count Mac Congail of Carrick is already pushing his independence on me. He took a month to create his faction and then try to push his demands on me. Fuck that noise.

[23 January

Well, even within his own court.

[25 November

I am the father of a beautiful baby girl, because now House av Reddit can continue to procreate! There's a lot more pressure on me to continue my legacy for my future dynasty.

[2 January

Shit.

[21 June

Denmark has agreed to come to my aid, I know we would have loved to keep our independence, but try not to hold it against me too much!

[27 January

Denmark is no longer a part of the war with Scotland. There really is no hope left.

[26 April

The war is coming to an end. My only solace is that King Malcolm was killed in battle

14 July

Well the war is over. I am apparently quite the dumbass, and I feel sorry for my future heir. My next goal is to work on getting the money together to create the Duchy of Galloway. I hear distant news of merchant families making thousands of gold coins, and I forgot how tough it is to come by money over here in the northwest!

21 November

As I'm waiting for money to collect

[31 January

As I was looking through my list of vassals (all 3 of them), what? I'm sure he'll be fine, [but there's talk that the roads aren't as safe as they used to be!](http://i.imgur.com/TWiGIrj.jpg)

31 December

A son was born! Now that I have more than one child, I am rather passive by nature.

17 June

I've improved some of my skills

[13 October

That was a bad idea. A very bad idea. I think I knew that deep down inside

[12 June

Well this small war has almost bankrupt me. I had to blitz with a small mercenary force

5 January

My son is at the age where he can be educated. Naturally I am going to take him under my wing to complete his training. Hopefully I can train him to be a better leader than I am – this war that I'm in is taxing and tedious

[30 July

After waiting around, I found a good civil war in Scotland. The King of Scotland is losing his throne, and so I took the opportunity to try and reclaim Argyle. We'll see if my over-aggression hurts me or not.

12 June

Unfortunately, forcing my surrender. It seems that I won't conquer any land for the next member of our dynasty to inherit.

30 May

Scotland invades Soreyar

20 July

The Pope died recently, just as Scotland will finish me off.

[26 December

Gallaway is forcing their independence. I am unable to raise any levies

10 March

My chancellor has finally come through. I have a false claim on Ulster. Hopefully I can come out of these rebellions relatively unscathed

1 July

I've fallen ill. I hope I can remain alive

10 August

I feel alive! The fever is gone and I feel great! 

30 March

My chaplain tried to convince me to convert the Lollard heresy. I refrained from it – maybe we can go heretic later on in our dynasty. I don't want to fuck it up for everyone more than I have already.

[17 January

I have usurped the County of Ulster! My first good deed for our dynasty. Hopefully I can continue this movement into Ireland.

This manual is over 3 MB in size and is nearly 100 pages long. It is up-to-date as of the 1.10 patch and includes all of the major DLC (Sword of Islam, and The Old Gods).

It is not approved by or associated with Paradox Interactive, and is not intended to replace or compete with any work they have produced. It is made freely available by me, the sole creator, and will be removed if Paradox deems it a conflict with their products.

- Larger and branching RPG-style event chains that effect your character or other's in your realm

Anyways. I played the Mande as if they had similar cultural norms to the Akan people in terms of matrilineal land succession, and patrilineal like their european counterparts.)

Then I went home to wage war against Tyrone, thinking my Crusading efforts were through. Nope.

About 3 years later I checked on the Crusade again and found myself about 0.5 percent off the lead in terms of contributions. How? Nobody had ever retaken my holdings in Sicily. I rounded up about 7000 in levies and mercenaries and went back to do exactly what I'd done before: follow enemy armies around, 14,000 Caliphate forces and about 12,000 HRE and various ally forces) I used my ships to get a quick route and attack the enemy first, taking substantial casualties but getting credit for leading the ultimate victory as well as any prisoners taken in the effort. At the end, my contributions sat at 51% despite only losing about 4000 men in the whole course of the Crusade, and since Sicily was held by a non-Catholic, I was given the whole of Sicily.

 ''I some cunt''.
The glorious emperor Niketas the Great died after contracting syphilis from his slutty mistress and his son Boethius came into power as the rightful first born son. Now as it happened Boethius was a greedy, there was a coup against the throne and I had no chance of winning a civil war so I ceded the throne to the traitor. Now I shrugged my shoulders, the Byzantine throne was just an assassination away. 
Little did I know it would be a twenty year odyssey littered with bodies. 
Weeks after the coup Simeon had a two sets of twins (who were born in the purple to make it worse). I was still wildly unpopular so no plots could be hatched. 
Meh I thought
But I was in luck. The empresses wife was plotting to murder my son, so I had her blinded in the hope of no more kids. It worked.
The emperor loathed me and the feelings were mutual and I could feel an imprisonment looming so I had to act fast.
To make a long story short, and covered my bets by marrying one of my daughters to the heir. I murdered Iosephs second son in a plot, but he discovered an attempt against his eldest but had no idea about his second (heh) . I had to offload a duchy to keep in his graces. 
History repeated itself and I could feel an imprisonment arriving so the emperor was assassinated in a very risky killing band it cost a fortune. I was firmly in the driving seat and I launched a coup against the heir won and had him imprisoned
Boom Basileus Boethius the Wicked, adulterer (told ya history repeats itself.  Murdered half his dynasty, spent up to 9000 gold on various gifts and killings, and caused an extremely bloody and protracted war *for his brother* who he later murdered. I love this game.

4. What is the status of my target's allies. (Especially important for holy wars
5. What is the status of my threats. (Nations who have claims on your stuff are always a threat...even if they don't care about your initial target. If a neighbor with a claim has been at peace for years
6. How much money do I have? (Always have enough to hire an additional merc band
7. How much money does my target have? (Very important when attacking republics)
8. Can I weaken my target first before going to war? (Sowing dissent is OK...but murdering a leader with a child heir is better. If you can throw a nation into chaos first
9. If my ruler dies during the war, this is not as much of a problem).

 Maybe your 21 learning Chaplin just died and the next best guy only has a 12. 

There are a few things you can do... you can try your luck with 'invite noble' or 'invite holy man' and hope that the randomly generated courtier has good stats...but that is often wasteful and very unreliable. 

You could go to the people searching window and look for men with good stats to invite to your court...but this is tedious and very unreliable. Unless you can press a claim of theirs and they don't like their liege

The best solution is with your daughters and matrilineal marriage. The willingness of a male to come to your court is now no longer based on claims they might have or how well they like their liege

By clicking the marriage icon on your daughter, he'll come to your court and can then be made into a council member. 

There are a few other advantages to this: 

1. Your daughter will start giving you grandchildren in court...this opens up the possibility of superior future heirs

2. Your daughter will not be giving children with weak claims to other realms.

3. Her husband is ultimately disposable

4. Her husband can be nominated to be the heir to a bishopric if he has decent stats and you are in free investiture. By making him a bishop

The two downsides to this are that you lose out on a potential alliance from marrying off your daughter

Note: this generally does not work with more distant women (Nieces and female kinsmen). Once you get to that level of seperation,False,self,t5_2tgic,1367503804.0,,verona,t3_1djslz

""Assemblymen, and their widows, daughters, and younger sons will bring much pleasure to me and my men before they, too, are killed.

""Although I will not tolerate treason during my reign

The assemblymen are gazing at their feet. Their expressions are far away. One by one, Mayor Uzluk of Suar, rises from his seat and claps loudly. Like deer bolting from a copse, the rest of the assembly rises in imitation. Some feign joyful weeping; others give forced cheers and praises.

""Your highness, the Cheremisa, did claim certain villages and strongholds, in right of your great predecessor, Attila the Hun. In answer of which claim, the High Chief my master says that you savour too much of your youth, and bids you satisfy yourself with the shores of the confluence of the Volga, as more appropriate for your youthful spirit

I gesture to my stewards

I drum my fingers against the arm of my throne. My head tilts back, I speak.

Tell your master that I will crush him; I will see him and his people driven before me; and I will listen with delight to the lamentation of his women. Go in peace, and tell him. Go!""

As the messenger departs

""Call up the troops! I want two thousand men assembled in Bulgar by the end of the month!""

**17 December

The godless horde of High Chief Biyar surround [the walls of Bulgar](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bolgar.JPG) in a foolhardy siege. Hearing the roar of our hooves, Biyar and his personal guard flee back to the safety of the Mordvin patrimony. The Battle of Ashli is a great victory; that we outnumbered our foe two to one is of no consequence.

Pyera's troops are driven against their walls and impaled. Alas, Pyera and his personal retainers escaped through a secret tunnel back into the city. Rather than lay siege to the pagan citadel, I lead my troops south to complete our destruction of the Mordvins.

Victory! I lay waste to the Mordvins and delight in the personal torture and execution of their priests and noblemen. Biyar, Pyera, takes them into his care at Perym. I divide the Cheremisa among various courtiers - contented, quiet stewards who will obey me for the foreseeable future - and return to Bulgar in triumph.

**7 March 1072**

I find Chief Tugan, and another with one of his sons (I can't remember which, really), I cut off his thumbs and throw him in prison. He'll stay there till he rots, no matter how many times he begs for more suitable accomodations! I strip him of his title and grant it to one of my loyal followers.

As I bathe at camp that evening, the High Chief of Tyumen may be easier to repel than I had first assumed...

**25 December 1073**

Word reaches me that my steward, High Chief Pyera has accepted defeat. He will not press his claim further. Uzyuk's men in Perm march south to join the bulk of my forces as we sack the Cuman villages, temples, and citadels of Tyumen.

While peering out of one of the tower's windows, peeking back at me! The boy, who has accompanied me with his mother on my campaign in Tyumen, is about six years old now; it's high time I took him under my wing and educated him! Fatherly discipline will keep him from wandering off so foolishly. I seize him by the waist, pull him inside, and drop him on the floor of the tower.

Keyboard Shortcuts + Interface Adjust:

	Interface Adjust:  Adjusts the character selection GUI so that it does not overlap with the character interface.

	Keyboard Shortcuts:
This adds 11 shortcuts to the game: ""z"",""v"",""b"",""n"",""m"","","",""/""

z raises levy directly from any county you have control over

z also toggles siege interface while selecting a province or army in an enemy province.

z also sends units to the left side of an army or ship balancing screen

z will 'cancel' or 'go to' on event windows (such as disband troops

z will go to the previous holding in demesne

x dismisses the currently selected levy (army or ship)

c raises ships directly from any county you have control over

c assaults holdings when you have an army/county is selected that allows for assaulting

c Confirms diplomacy interactions

v embarks the currently selected levy into a ship that is IN port in that province

v also selects all armies inside boats if a ship is selected

v also will close one army at a time while having multiple armies selected.  The two previously mentioned shortcuts take priorty.  This shortcut is ideal for raiding with multiple armies as a viking.  (v selects armies, right click onto another county, repeat.)

v will create a new vassal from the holding screen of minor owned baronies

b merges selected levies or ships

b also sends units to the right side of an army or ship balancing screen

b will go to the next holding in demesne

b is also back button for the main interfaces

n selects the trade port screen on coastal provinces

m selects the normal holdings screen 

l toggles looter status for pagan armies

To manually alter keybindings
use notepad++ to 'search in files'
search for: Shortcut = ""
(leave the quotations open)
this will pull up all the shortcuts listed in the mod files.
doubleclick on the bottom of the screen through each of the results until you see the ""guiButtonType =	{"" that looks like what you want.
you can alter or remove any of the options that say ""shortcut = ""x"""" to your liking
There is some trial and error to this if you are not experienced with the layout of the game files.  Just play with it

**marking a person of interest**
by  [star_eater ](http://www.reddit.com/user/star_eater)
&gt; Right-click on the character, it will bring up a sub-menu with three buttons: one marks the character as special interest (and will show up on the right panel if you set it up to display special interest characters) and give you high priority messages for them

**boats**
by [nvsbl](http://www.reddit.com/user/nvsbl)
&gt;Another thing I learned faaaarrrrr too late: if you click one fleet and hold shift, and then either move all armies definitively out of my click box area, or click each. and. every. fleet. individually. It was both liberating and embarrassing at once when I realized this.

**messaging**

 * holding ctrl when deleting a message 
 * holding shift 
say you have 34 unread messages and 20 are from construction finished in ... 


**technology**

click on a county you will see the technology numbers (9/16/14 (constantinople 1066))
hovering with the mouse above it will shown you the advances chances .
(in this case only a meager 0.85%/year for bows because of an ahead penalty of -77%

you can use this to see what the AI is focusing on!

**republic tab**

 * holding ctrl when clicking the campaign fund raises or lowers the fund with 100 ( thats 9 clicks saved)
 * holding shift when clicking the campaign fund  raises or lowers the campaign fund with 50 (thats 4 clicks saved)

**updates &amp; additions**

 * chancing names of cities, bishoprics  , click on the county/city and click again on the name
you are now able to chance the name. always want to be the ""count of the imperial republic of galaxies"" 
now you can

 *  **time saving in plotting** by [TheGuyWithTheEars](http://www.reddit.com/user/TheGuyWithTheEars)
&gt;I have one that saves time when inviting a bunch people to plots. After opening the potential plotters window right click on their portrait and then right click on the diplomacy button to bring up the mini-menu (same process as marking someone special interest

 * **reorganizing units**  by ahhheygao on the Paradox forums: thx to [UseHerNom](http://www.reddit.com/user/UseHerNom)
&gt;You can reorganize your unit composition for each of the three ""flanks"" (or combine 3 into 2 or just 1) by clicking [on the arrow button to the right of the unit icons](http://i.imgur.com/xxcq0H4.jpg) and then using [the small left or right arrows](http://i.imgur.com/sx18BMp.jpg) for each individual levy or retinue

I'm currently in a Wales playthrough and decided to check out the ancestors of my characters and my vassals ancestors. To my surprise Paradox has not only covered the ancestors of the starting characters but also the ancient line of the Lords of Wales all the way back to 300ad.

For those interested:

* [Tegid Prydain](http://i.imgur.com/Xrm9yc6.jpg)

* [Gwrtheyrn Gwerthrynion](http://i.imgur.com/UsyX4fd.jpg), progenitor of the Mathrafal Dynasty and the guy who apparently invited the Anglo-Saxons to Britain.

* [Coel the Hen](http://i.imgur.com/L79q6ssh.jpg?1), ruler of Alt Clud (Strathclyde) and father-in-law of Cunedda. All the Welsh dynasties are all descendants of this guy apparently.

Naturally the college elects the Pope.

But what we really need is something to fight over

Every kingdom should be able to set it's tithe to the pope.  Excess funds collected above the tithe go to the crown.  Obviously the pope would want *more* money

Empire level titles should also require papal support

[24 march 1257](http://i.imgur.com/JW1dLKw.jpg)

I am still in awe over the events that transpired during my father's reign. In any sensible world I would've been the heir to two of the pettiest kingdoms in Europe

[Same day](http://i.imgur.com/SWCTUpf.jpg)

As wonderful as this is to the glorious house af Reddit, hoping his future rule will be easier to swallow.

[Same day](http://i.imgur.com/LtCHASn.jpg)

I am wary of the huge mongol empires right next to my eastern border. The young khan of the Golden Horde is yet to be married

[2 may 1257](http://i.imgur.com/ZtDC1eg.jpg)

Oh dear

[29 may 1257](http://i.imgur.com/uY0T9q0.jpg)

I'm in luck! It seems the pretender had an... unfortunate accident... meaning the war is settled undecided. How nice!

[3 june 1257](http://i.imgur.com/Mg1TpDA.jpg)

Despite this obviously being an accident

[13 june 1257](http://i.imgur.com/u069CQC.jpg)

And to top it off this spoiled brat goes complaining to the pope! What did I ever do to her? Anyway

[27 june 1257](http://i.imgur.com/Ra3NZoj.jpg)

Well isn't this cute! My little brother and his single county is trying to usurp my throne. This will be easily taken care of.

[29 september 1257](http://i.imgur.com/gD2mktb.jpg)

Son of a bitch! I just can not catch a break, is he any different from me in their eyes?

[22 november 1258](http://i.imgur.com/c1stmnt.jpg)

Lady luck smiles upon me again as another tragic accident removes my rebellious brother from my list of problems. Amazing how these things are working out for me...

[28 november 1259](http://i.imgur.com/T5tfKfs.jpg)

The calm doesn't last long, I mean, strange accident - won't buy me out of the trouble. It seems I'll have to stand my ground and 
actually fight them off this time.

[7 december 1259](http://i.imgur.com/IjKUd1M.jpg)

But this is where my strategic diplomacy earlier pays off! A quick bribe to the Mongol Khan and he is happy to aid me in my war. Amazing how a savage pagan like him actually seems more honourable than my Christian vassals. With his help I might just pull this through.

[2 april 1260](http://i.imgur.com/zEWcQSN.jpg)

...that is unless a second wave of traitors comes a' knocking. Will they ever give up?

[5 april 1260](http://i.imgur.com/k15fMGL.jpg)

But once again it seems trying to usurp my throne is perilous to your health. They say throwing a coin in a well will make your wishes come true

In happier news, there shouldn't be many claimants left to bother me.

[6 july 1265](http://i.imgur.com/UR6O27g.jpg)

Gosh, I'm sick of these wars, I'll just give in to their demands. I won't lose any land and maybe some secessions will keep these troublemakers quiet for a while.

OH GOD DAMN IT! The luck of af Reddit strikes again!

[8 february 1267](http://i.imgur.com/Riztx6l.jpg)

Keep the good news coming, having to deal with the full force of the muslim world while suffering a major civil war is not what I signed up for.

Luckily my christian brethren do not stand idly by. Many were called

[30 march 1267](http://i.imgur.com/FMGHgst.jpg)

Now this was an unexpected turn of events. When infidel hordes are invading it finally seems like my vassals are getting their priorities straight and suddenly they support me whole-heartedly. Who would've thought this jihad could turn into something positive?

[4 august 1270](http://i.imgur.com/HqkzFop.jpg)

As much as I'd still like to properly punish these scum for their dishonourable actions I

In the midst of everything the Golden Horde has found the righteous path. I like to think my enlightened rule has inspired this spiritual awakening.

[24 may 1275](http://i.imgur.com/MeitawJ.jpg)

Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish when you set aside your differences and work together? The muslims never stood a chance!

[19 august 1275](http://i.imgur.com/ojR8V25.jpg)

Now that my vassals have finally accepted me as their rightful ruler I can focus on more important things. Namely

It didn't take long to win the war.  I've seemingly become the most powerful person in all of Ireland

[Apr 1204](http://i.imgur.com/ygDqqd1h.jpg)

In a series of rather crazy events, King Findlay II, married Princess Helene of the ERE to gain an ally when House af Reddit was struggling bad.  Well, her father, Basileus Basileios (can we just take a second and sit in awe for this incredible, incredible name?) died of natural causes, leaving Helene's brother Stephanos in charge. He died in battle, who died after a period of illness. So Helen ends up in in charge of the ERE and she's my freaking mother!  Since I am a genius and Findlay II named me

I have nominated him as my heir as well to merge the families.  This is the first time I am thinking of killing myself, seems like a better choice.

My dear brother is dead, some major good fortune has stuck af Reddit!

-Loot transfer trick:

If you split a fleet with loot on it

-Prestige bombs to help with succession:

If you are in no immediate need of cash but have troops available for raiding, land the ship and build a runestone for a huge boost to relations within days of succession.  A blot will also provide a nice boost if the timing is right.

-Skirmisher retinue raiders:

It is no secret that archers are by far the best assault troops.  Skirmishers set as raiders can finish fully ransacked raids before the victim can respond at all.  I highly recommend using your retinues exclusively on skirmishers for this purpose.

-Double ransacking:

  If you have even one non-raider troop in your raider stack

If you wished to siege but bypass ransacking (for the stealth war trick below) do the same trick with moving

-Stealth wars:

Because you have the ability to siege and occupy territories while not officially at war, thus allowing you to potentially start wars with 100% (or very high at least) war-score immediately.  Occupied territories eventually go back to their owners control and I'm not sure what the timing is for that, so you have to be at least moderately quick about it.

The uses of this are two-fold:  Finishing wars quickly can remove the potential for war allies to ever be called against you.  Handy for dealing with Karlings.

Another use is being able to ""prime"" a series of small wars without reassembling your levies.  For instance

a.  Declaring each war individually

b.  Declaring all wars simultaneously

c.  Use stealth warfare to occupy all of the irish counts without ever officially declaring war.  Disband levies

-Theocracy vassals are good.  Whenever possible

-That being said

Pros:
Succession becomes easier
Unlocks the ability to holy war for duchies.
Unlocks great holy wars (crusades) at 1100.
Relations boost for temple vassals.
Allows demand conversion and makes conversion easier.

Cons:
Splinters your vassals religions.
You lose 1/3 of your retinue cap.  The 50% retinue bonus that unreformed norse get is multiplicative with the tech bonus.  So it hurts to lose it.
You now get raised levies opinion modifier with all of your vassals.
Supply vs pagans is bad.

I cannot stress how much you will miss the levy bonus if you reform too early.  Ideally, buying all the retinues you can hold, then reform)

-Keep only one top level title.  Don't make a second duchy until you are ready to make a kingdom.  Don't make a second duchy until you are ready to make an empire.

The 0 year old baby inherited the Iron throne, and in the same turn, won the battle against the north (Rob surrendered and the Starks gave up their war of independence) and defeated Stannis.  The 0 year old infant decided that Stannis was to be executed, but the Starks were to remain in power in the north.

1366719090.0,1cxijx,Tip: The Ultimogeniture Gambit,Pinstar,53,7,24," I was originally leery of this new succession law when it first came out

**The Law itself:**
The youngest eligible heir of YOUR direct children (no grandchildren are factored) becomes the first to inherit. It will follow your gender laws the same as Primo.

**The Gambit:** 
Marry your ruler/heir to someone with good stats...but focus more on genetics and favor any +fertility traits. If your ruler gets the option to go the hedonism route

While she's busy pushing out babies for you
Keep having your wife pop out kids until she gives you a son with a good genetic trait. (Strong/Genius/Quick/Attractive). Once she blesses you with that wonderful child... divorce her (or kill her if the pope doesn't like you enough). If the RNG isn't on your side and you get no genetically gifted children, you can always choose the celibate option if you are happy with your youngest, thus eliminating the need to divorce your 1st wife). 

When you go looking for a 2nd wife, you don't care about her genetics. 

By choosing when to turn off the baby fountain

**Risks:**
Just because a child starts life with a good genetic trait doesn't mean they'll be your star heir. Bad trait events (and bad luck during them) and bad stat growth can lead to a sub-par heir. 
The early death of your ruler can put you into some very long regencies. With their older brothers already adults

**EDIT: Female Rulers**
Female rulers present a problem to this tactic. Since you are the woman, you should be able to get some boys. 

**Emergency Switches:**
There is always the option for murder...but if your youngest and #2 and #3 in line are ALL mothballs... there is always the option to flip over to Primo (if you have the proper crown authority). By having the ability to switch to primo (and when in Primo

**Conclusion:**
While it will never rival the sheer power and flexibility of Agnatic-Cognatic Elective with a 100% controlled election... that is not always an option when there are too many dejure dukes with voting powers. Ultimogeniture holds the next best way to control your heir. It doesn't even need high crown authority! 

If you haven't given this law a spin

*(Editors note: Holy crap

[8th January

I, heir of Ceasar and Augustus, refuse to be crowned. A man of... of my sheer power cannot be crowned by a mere Bishop or  Cardinal, I must be crowned by His hands alone, or the earthly ones of the Pontiff in Rome. But the old fool refuses me, and my ancestors have allowed his wretched reign to continue for too long.

[Later that day...](http://i.imgur.com/t8qzW1P.jpg)

Pontiff Adrian IV, but they had attracted little attention outside Ireland, and thirty years ago they were evicted by the Irish King. But  my agents have found him, hidden in Cumania, and brought him to the Seat of the World.

[28th January 1349](http://i.imgur.com/eKKNFQb.jpg)

I have dispatched notices to all of my vassals, Arsenos who rules in Sicily, informing him to await the arrival of my force in Napoli.
 
[26th March 1349](http://i.imgur.com/HJrNlc9.jpg)

The Lords of the East (Valerios of Anatolia, whilst Valerios is trying to defeat the Khan of all Persia. God bless his expedition, but I fear that bringing his sons with him will end poorly. I'll have someone look into the region.
 
[9th July 1349](http://i.imgur.com/J1HFKmj.jpg)

I am out of patience! The forces we have mustered will be enough I am sure, sailing with several hundred ships, a further 10,000 mustered across the Aegea and up to 30,000 men under the command of my dear Arsenios in Sicily. With such a force, even the will of God may be changed!
Alas, constructed by my late father. They shall conduct the raid in the fall, so that should it turn poorly, I will be far out of earshot of the complaints.
 
[12th September 1349](http://i.imgur.com/b5xgJ4k.jpg)

I have arrived in Neapoli. About that voyage I can only say that we lost a couple of thousand men, cousin Aresnios has been busy, he has matched our force in size and is sitting at Avellino to the north. We shall march to meet our enemy wherever he walks!

Happy New Year.
 
29th March

I hate Italy. The conquest of Rome only rallied the soldiers of this damnable country into opposing me. Overnight, my second in Command for these efforts, called the war a disaster of Logistics. We've lost 20,000 men since we took the ancient city, and are about to face an assault. [**And then, right on queue...**](http://i.imgur.com/ny44ty9.jpg)
 
[2nd April](http://i.imgur.com/K4CrLfJ.jpg)

Crap. I don't know if I have the men to hold this off. Rome comes first. I can clean up the rest later. With a god given crown upon my head these idiots will kneel for the axe blow willingly.
 
[8th May](http://i.imgur.com/5HpcOnY.jpg)

At last, I grant him the old basilica of the Patriarchs to do with as he likes. But now I have more serious buisness to attend to. The rebellion of England has led to copy cats closer to home, and I need a stable realm for my appointment to Emperor. The Fleet prepares for voyage.
 
[28th June](http://i.imgur.com/up9EANl.jpg)

I have heards no news from the Irish
 
[5th November 1351](http://i.imgur.com/iB2N7nN.jpg)

The situation remains grim. Our men campaign in Carinthia, our German Holdings are the same. The English are launching a full invasion of the Kingdom of Ireland. We've heard only defeat from Portugal and my own position in Cyrencia is about to be threatened by the Norman King Mauger of Africa. The campaign continues.
 
[4th February 1352](http://i.imgur.com/x1aF7ef.jpg)

I speak here through an interpreter. I, do, in light of my sudden deathly illness, command that I shall be sailed back to Constantinople without delay. Should the almighty wish for me to perish for my actions, then I would pray to see his greatest city one last time...
 
[11th March](http://i.imgur.com/ZvDNwAw.jpg)

And Broen of Ireland kneels, but that is all... My dear Arsenios, you must withdraw from Carinthia. My brothers will need you when I die. The Empire must not collapse.
 
[16th March](http://i.imgur.com/4luDrOU.jpg)

Fair people of Constantinople

We have suffered greatly, our freedom from unappreciative vassals who have no more claim to our protection than the Italians!  We shall celebrate the mind of the Empire: my own coronation, the heart of the Empire: an Empress to be beloved, and finally the body of the Empire: free Chariot Races for all the people of Constantinople, Green and Blue alike! And then, once we have gourged ourselves heavy on the prosperity of our might, I shall return to the field and win us victories anew!

[**For Rome! For it's Emperor! For God!**](http://i.imgur.com/RTcrtzw.jpg)
 
[11th April](http://i.imgur.com/Dmsv9Pw.jpg)

Sadly I do not appear to have a choice in brides, whom still holds the ceremonial title of Ceasar. I barely know anything more about her, but I'm sure the quiet little thing will do well enough to give me a son. We'll marry before the Coronation and then be crowned together, that'll please her father most.
 
11th July

I am finally crowned as Emperor, and in front of a cheering crowd of God's people. During the games I was even awarded an award in the Melee! This is truely bliss.
 
10th October

It seems my campaign plans are delayed until the next year. The whole of the east is up in arms with each other over territory
 
[9th March

My son is born! My advisers chose wisely, I think. Emperor Damianos II. Now I must secure the Empire he is to reign. Where to go... I think perhaps back into Italy. The Despot of Sicily has requested leave to conduct his war into North Africa, and I have no interest in marching an army all the way into Cumania... and I certainly can't sail to the North without preparation. So, let's secure Telesphorus II against the Waldesians in Tuscany. It'll be like good old times.
 
[4th June

I hate Italy. Leading an army north to the Po, from incoming German forces. However I found not a sign in this wild, eternally conflicting country.  I passed north, crossed the Po, and headed for one of the more famous passes of the Alps, where I anticipated... resistance. Anything really, a fort perhaps. Thankfully, and gave chase. We forced them into a conflict but one of the blasted fishermen got me with an arrow! I'll have to watch this from the sidelines with this damnable doctor
 
[24th June](http://i.imgur.com/cKxWEnd.jpg)

I survived, the son of the King of Lotheringa, and executed him at Mantua. Hardly a Redditor, that one. Our family is spread to thin to be merciful simply due to a shared name. Actions define us now, not names.
 
4th November

Success! Firenze is in our hands. I'm granting all lands to my brother, that one.
 
21st June

Theophano died today, she gave me my beloved son. And she deserves all respects for that. I've been looking at the Histories, Theophano is only the second wife of my line to have been murdered, after one of the many wives of my Great Grandfather. I suppose that will have to be honour enough.

The rumours of my complicity have begun
 
[24th February

A small group of Islamic Counts have declared Jihad upon me
 
August 17th

Our voyage was much calmer than the one to Italy, perhaps! It has not been so long since it collapsed, I'm sure we can work something out. After the Jihad is done with, of course.

Anyway. My expedition is equipped, and so we shall be sailing down to greet them. I do not know when I will return, or if this is a wild goose chase or not.  I assign my brother, Despot Athanasios, as regent in my absence. Keep men on the frontier. I am curious what the heights of the nile are, the locals don't seem to care upon questioning, so I won't keep my hopes up. Whatever is down there, clear it of these Shia and be done with it.

#3: **Brittany**. All are coastal.  No 6-holding. 4.1 coastal holdings/county.  25 coastal. 25 total.

#4: **Nikaea**.  All are coastal.  One 6-holding.  5.25 coastal holdings/county.  21 coastal.  21 total.

#5: **Tunis**. All but 2 are coastal. One 6-holding. 3.1 coastal holdings/county.  19 coastal. 28 total.

Runners-up: Tripolitania (16 coastal) Skåne (16 coastal) Moray (15 coastal)

*Bonus Holdings*:
Criteria: coastal low province duchies to also hold but not create:

#1: **Venice**: 7 holdings.

#2: **Genoa**: 6 holdings

#3: **Slesvig**: 2 provinces

#4: **Adrianopolis**: 2 provinces

Notes:

Sicily has 28 coastal holdings to Flanders' 26 and better tech, 5 universities).  These can and should become the richest single county in the game.  

While Normandy has a better rate of coastal holdings per county and is on par with many others for total coastal holdings

Many other duchies have better 'total holdings' but are partially or fully inland. Toulouse has only 2 coastal provinces,,False,self,t5_2tgic,1372857659.0,,True

**The diary of King Torf 'the Unyielding' d'Isigny**


My name is [Torf d'Isigny]( http://i.imgur.com/yZY0pqv.jpg). I am three years old. 

**17 june 1177.** This is the worst day in my life. I've been lying in this bed for such a long time

**18 june.** Mommy says fathers old friend [Gaillard]( http://i.imgur.com/kvpfRa1h.jpg) is going to help me be king. I'm a king? I just dreamt that the bed was full of bugs but I couldn't get them. There was a ferret too. 

**19 june.** I'm feeling much [better]( http://i.imgur.com/gtv49K5h.jpg). I haven't pooped blood all night and I'm even hungry again. 

**Summer, mercenaries and an empty treasury. But I'm not afraid, the war is far away and my castle is the strongest in the world. I also heard that some German Catholic is now the king of Jerusalem. 

**Spring 1180.** The war is going better my mother says. The heathens are fighting [among themselves]( http://i.imgur.com/GT4mFeRh.jpg). I am six now

**September 1181.** Gaillard

**January 1182.** My mother came to me today and told me that she had very bad news: my armies are almost completely gone. Defeated by the muslims and the Cuman oathbreakers. My father's friend and vassal the Duke of Basra rebelled against us. And on top of that my great grandmother died. [Luckily she she left us so much money we can raise some new troops]( http://i.imgur.com/ZKHY2KHh.jpg).

**April 1184.** My troops have captured the [enemy general]( http://i.imgur.com/zzf3knyh.jpg)! With dilligent work en some patience this is the beginning of the end for the heathens. I also have a new regent: Marshall Torf d'Alexandretta is my closest advisor now. I traveled with him to the land we have been fighting over

**16 February 1185.** [We have finally won this terrible war]( http://i.imgur.com/CfyYqMQh.jpg)! Finally this last legacy of my father

**April

**January 5

**March 3

**August 19

My mother and steward tell me it's time to marry. I'm not quite sure I want to give up my tumbling days and settle for just one woman. Another problem is that the traditional marriagepool of my family (the spawn of emperors) is currently very dry. My mother introduced me to Emeleline

After years of war among the ruling clans of Persia the Seljuks are back in the saddle

**27 Januari 1192.** Peace! The traitors have been forced to their knees. Sadly my beloved chronicler Efelefen wasn't there to record the signing of the peace treaty, and Judit of Mosul, the instigator is sentenced to life in prison until such time as I need money. 

I shall leave from my ancestral castle of Maison de Souris. The muslims may be wrong about many things theological

**November 23 1192.** I have a daughter! I shall name her [Astrid]( http://i.imgur.com/zCklgc2h.jpg).

**Januari 2 1193.** The [great Turk declared war]( http://i.imgur.com/LT8kLUVh.jpg) on me. He wants the whole of Mesopotamia for himself. I shall give him some hard men to chew. Call the militant orders! 

The [king of Francia is coming]( http://i.imgur.com/wOhx9M1h.jpg) to help defend our lands against the Turk. Heil Simon de Bourgogne!

In the middle of the fighting my wife gives birth to a son

**September 1196.** I've had messages from my spies in Persia and Egypt. Baybars Seljuk

**July 7

**December 7, make that a spoon, and use it to cut off the heads of duke Mleh d'Isigny of Aleppo and duke Wymund de Zweitina of Antioch. Because HOW DARE THOSE TRAITOROUS UNGRATEFULL [BASTARDS DECLARE WAR ON ME](http://i.imgur.com/4A0ZeLth.jpg) WHEN THE KINGDOM IS BESIEGED BY HEATHENS ON ALL SIDES!

**Januari

**21 June, long marches, the loss of the duchy of Antioch and the needless death of many ten thousand good men duke Mleh d'Isigny cornered and agreed [to sign the peace]( http://i.imgur.com/RXl1fZ2h.jpg). After eight years and six months of fighting the soldiers can go home to their families. It is finally done.
 Except that it is not. Punish the traitors

In between all this violence the apple of my eye

I found the ideal boy for my beautiful daughter. [John de Huntly]( http://i.imgur.com/1NOvCsCh.jpg) has a weird accent but that doesn't matter, as a good Christian should be. And he shall be the new prince of Duchess Astrid of Damascus. 

**5 September 1210.** My son [Lambert has come of age]( http://i.imgur.com/qIbCdbhh.jpg). He does not disappoint too much. I'll put him to work as steward before he get's lazy. 

**April 29 1212.** During a little war (more of a skirmish) of the revokation of Tortosa from the hands of a greedy priest my dear old enemy-vassal Judit of Mosul

**June, I have broken you. You are now beneath my notice. The steel boots of Christ shall step on you while I deal with more pressing business. 

**January 1215.** There are tales drifting from the east about a [Khan of Khans]( http://i.imgur.com/MQS5IMEh.jpg). For some reason I distrust steppe nomads.

**March 28

**November 1219.** While I'm once again trying to hold off both the traitors and heathens [the horde invades this side of the continent]( http://i.imgur.com/glr7ZQIh.jpg).

**December 1219.** Old traitors die and get replaced by new traitors. The new duchess of Aleppo [thinks she has a good chance of beating me]( http://i.imgur.com/1S5roJqh.jpg) while I'm distracted by all kinds of foreign and domestic enemies. Sadly

**April 1220.** My heir Lambert has decided to [die from leprosy]( http://i.imgur.com/C9Ot7TPh.jpg). No worries

**February 1221.** I had to [offer duchess Judit of Mosul a white peace]( http://i.imgur.com/gFoLvMOh.jpg). All these wars are starting to drown me. 

**1225.** The Muslims have once again joined the fray. They are trying to take my rebelling provinces from me. I am so very grateful for the militant orders. 

**December 1225.** I've had an 'alliance' with the Byzantine Basileus for a few years. [My youngest daughter married a son of his]( http://i.imgur.com/9taa1Klh.jpg). Since then he systematically refused to take part in any war of mine, you egotistical bastard) and now the vulture, the swollen drowned dog, the heretical barbarian [declares war on me for the province of Farkale]( http://i.imgur.com/FM81stmh.jpg). Fine. [He can have it]( http://i.imgur.com/bFhQqckh.jpg). My ancestors are spinning in the grave but I'm willing to wager they have never been continually at war for 40 years.  

**June 20, always on the go. I spent more nights with my generals than with my children. I was so tired of all the bloodshed, so very very tired. I hope my son takes care of [his sister]( http://i.imgur.com/4E1PEuNh.jpg). I hope he reads my diaries, in which I wrote down [my plans]( http://i.imgur.com/yZY0pqv.jpg).

Today I had my first taste of combat; the desperate defending troops attempted to counter attack and push us back but failed miserably. I was rather hoping this war could end without bloodshed on both sides.

[12th April 1073](http://i.imgur.com/iZMH2rV.jpg)

My scouts have handed me a report. An army of over 5000 men led Caliph al-Mustansir I has been spotted approaching Tripoli from the east. I had a bad feeling this would happen

We are in the middle of nowhere; we cannot escape in any direction. The intelligence suggests the army will arrive within 2 weeks; we can only stand our ground and fight.

**The life of Smperor Svein II af Reddit as written by /u/Geter_Pabriel**

[5 December

I am told that now is not the time to grieve mother’s untimely passing, but my regent calls me a “little diplomat”. I miss my Mommy.

*** 

[8 February

My Mother’s holy war for Baghdad has ended in another glorious victory for the Empire. There was a grand celebration after which was the most fun I had ever had. The Despot of Syria was very grateful for being giving control over the newly acquired duchy. It felt great celebrating our latest conquest. I remember Mother loving these celebrations as well. She was one to conquer and gain lands for our Empires name

*** 

[1 April

The regent thinks I am oblivious but I hear the whispers in the court. Many lords of my realm believe that they are deserving of independence

*** 

[June 7

The war we feared had begun. The opposition had less number than us but they were quite spread out and would be difficult to subdue. The regent had many meetings with our marshal to discuss a strategy. I had been studying under a brilliant strategist and I had plenty to offer in the war room

***

[April 4

Mother is truly watching over me. The war was as fast as I had predicted

***

July 28

I have decided to extend mercy to all of the traitors. My regent attempted to argue against it but I had it in my head that the best way for me to create a stable realm was to have vassals that trusted me. If they saw my mercy than they would truly respect me right? The regent is making me second guess myself but I believe I am right. Sometimes I’m mad at Mother for leaving me with this

***

May 2

I am finally sixteen! The regency has ended and it’s time for me to be fully recognized as Basileus. My meticulous studies of war paid off.  I will pair the might of my armies with the prowess of my command to bring my Empire to glory. I think I will announce myself to my realm with a grand tournament!

***

[September 14

The tournament came to a close and the victors had been crowned. Seeing men from all over that possessed such great martial talent gave me new aspirations for my Empire. I now had confidence that these men could lead armies in many wars being fought on many fronts simultaneously. I could see all of Europe coming under my control

***

June 24

After several conquests in Abyssnia

*** 

[March 22

After a short campaign the Isle of Man had returned to my realm into the hands of my Father.

***

[May 30

It occurred to me that Europe would never kneel before the throne being in Constantinople. I had to restore the Roman Empire to what it once was. I had to bring the throne back to the center of the world. The world would recognize my Empire to be the true Roman Empire.

***

[March 15

I fell in love with a German Duchess. I never thought it could happen to me so fast. She was beautiful and had power. She carried her authority so well

***

May 22

The Italian Despot had to solidify his de jure holdings before we could declare ourselves to truly be Rome, enough for me to declare war.

*** 

[August 15

Venice was overwhelmed with Italy’s forces and fell under the Despot’s control.

***

[December 9

My beautiful Wife had passed away. She was with child. I am devastated but I remember back to Mother’s death. The Basileus must be strong. The campaign shall continue.

***

[February 18

The war for Ferrara had ended and I gave the land the Despot of Italy. I thought the Empire was officially ready to be recognized as Rome

***

March 1

Bodeno. I will forever remember that name. There was nothing special about Bodeno itself. In fact it was quite unremarkable

***

[October 2

There was but one battle in this war. It took place shortly after the siege of Bodeno itself. The armies of the two Roman Empires met north of the Barony. Many lives were lost

***

[January 4

Today is the first day of my long campaign to restore Rome fully. Rome was once again the capital of the greatest empire in the world

***

[November 11

My brother fought along my side in the remainder of the holy wars for Abyssnia. As reward

***

[December 30

It was time for me to remarry. Despite still loving my first wife

***

[June 13

After pressing many claims and breaking several truces

*** 

[February 8

In a process similar to the one I used in France. I was able to usurp the Holy Roman Empire. However this process was much harder. I had to fabricate and press many more claims, all that remained were smaller holdings, ready to be taken.

***

[November 17

After several more campaigns

***

[March 6

Following my formula for conquest

***

[May 25

All of Britannia is now under my control; all of the Holy Roman Empire’s former holdings were under my control. I had finished my campaign to restore the borders of the old Western Roman Empire. I was able to spend time with my family. My wife had birthed several more sons at this point and even a daughter. I rarely saw my family as I was always out leading troops. However, towards the Mongol Hordes. Both the Golden Horde and the Timurids were in a splintered state. Several successful civil wars lead to many small independent nations in their areas. The Despot of Ruthenia had already began to campaign against these small states in [Russia] (http://i.imgur.com/D7nm28Ih.jpg), and it was apparent he was going to continue them.

***

19 May

So far the holy wars had been a great success. I had conquered all of Arabia and given to my sons. Meanwhile I bring the nations of the Baltic under my control

***

[September 12

I have driven the Timurids back into Persia making them a shell of what they once were. My series of Holy Wars were a successful and now the true faith could be brought to those lands. I could consider my campaign against Islam over

***

January 1

I decided to celebrate the New Year with my half-brother. After our Father passed I decided to give the holdings I inherited from him to my half-brother, it made me happy to know that I was able to honor the name [Af Reddit.] (http://i.imgur.com/vRFkeTIh.jpg)

I notice that they all have a problem with how much land I personally own - I find this offensive.  I just because my family has been successful you are going to look negatively upon us?

[31 May 1116](http://i.imgur.com/HBJw8lg.jpg)

Fuck.  The King of Scotland has gone to war with me.  I cannot win both of these wars.

[26 July 1116](http://i.imgur.com/m6UPiJs.jpg)

Now I’m feeling a bit in trouble … Scotland can field twice the army I can, down to Castille…

[18 October 1116](http://i.imgur.com/TRUOUnC.jpg)

Some minor good came from this (and I emphasize minor), and came away a better leader

[2 April 1117](http://i.imgur.com/6CLty60.jpg)

Well, England joined Scotland in their war against me, leaving me outnumbered about 4:1.  Scotland has been happily taking my land, leaving me no recourse.

[22 June 1117](http://i.imgur.com/lKiCiE1.jpg)

Fuckkkkkk.  I guess my vassals could tell my situation was tenuous at best

[25 June 1117](http://i.imgur.com/wrn3tbn.jpg)

Well, and accept peace, or fight it out, and destroy the realm. I’ve got no choice; it’s for the betterment of House af Reddit…I'm forced to relinquish my title to lift this excommunication.

[25 June 1117](http://i.imgur.com/LJLSYm6.jpg)

So, ended in a pretty bad spot for my son King Findlay.

Eight-hundred and twenty-seven years [from the founding of the city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita), [Marcus Antonius Polemon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemon_II_of_Pontus) - mighty king of Colchis and Cilicia - fled to the shores of the Baltic. Sailing far, far up [the gentle Nemunas](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/Jeffas/nemunas3.jpg) with his fleet of ships, he landed at a bend in [the Dubysa River](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Kernave_Neris.jpg). Beyond it, no boat could travel. There, upon a tall and formidable hill, he founded [Kernavė](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Kernav%C4%97_-_Hill_forts_01.jpg). The Lithuanian race was born.

Centuries passed. Our people grew weak and complacent. Our culture changed

Until now.

**13 Vasaris

It was evening when it happened. The family was at supper, [my wife](http://i.imgur.com/hSt862Kh.jpg); and beside her, [the wife of my son](http://i.imgur.com/fFZbZehh.jpg). The younger children were in bed. [I heard a sound at the window](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrHXmV1yWYo) and turned my head, straining to hear it. It was the horn call of the Yatviag clan. It grew louder, closer. A cluster of torches was visible on the plain beyond the city; the rumble of horses grew apparent.

""Halloo!"" was the cry. ""Halloo

""What news?"" I bellowed to the horseback figures in the courtyard below.

""Woe! Terrible woe!""

I leapt from the table and ran to the highest window in the castle. I unhooked [the family horn](http://i.imgur.com/YBMcMfA.png), with arms"".

By the time I had dressed for combat and stumbled to the front entrance with my son and our wives

""Great Chief: our lord and master, the Lady Giltine, his sister, is his sole surviving relative. She is the true heir of the Yatviags and must rush to our capital in Lyck to take her place. Her husband, your son, must go as well. We must move quickly, and with arms; even now

I turned to face Giltine. Her gaze was far away

""It seems I'll be your spymistress no more, you and I. And two generations hence, our two great nations will be united under a single family: *our* family"". She struck out a claw-like arm on the word *our*, grasping at my son in a well-executed imitation of affection. This was no ordinary hunting accident, I thought. She had a hand in it. She *had* to have a hand in it: all those years of practiced intrigue at both our courts.. surely she had arranged her brother's death to secure her own succession.

Two can play this ambitious game

It was a long and dreary ride at the edge of nightfall to the Yatviagi capital of Lyck. Let in through the city and castle gates by sympathetic loyalists

Or

[Butavas](http://i.imgur.com/6t5ECtBh.jpg), somehow, I still have not grown accustomed to the sight of his disfigured back. I watch it bob gently - to the left, to the right - as he shares with me this latest news.

""Your wife's brother, Bubilas. With the future of that chiefdom uncertain, my sources argue that you should press your wife's claim to it. Her claim is strong enough that the people will accept her as their leader. Sir, what are you going to do? Sir? My eyes are over here, sir.""

I snap back into the present

""Yes

As my forces gather to wage war on the infant High Chief, and darkness. Slowly, silently, I formulate a plan - a dark and terrible plan unprecedented in the history of our family. If I am successful in my intrigues and deceptions, our family may prosper, and my legacy may endure. If I am successful, I will be the father of a great and Lithuanian nation and the sire of a strong and vigorous noble house. But if I fail..

If I fail it will be my ruin.

[Marshal Ragutis](http://i.imgur.com/JttBmugh.jpg) is an incompetent fool; the campaign for my wife's claim to the Zemaitija tribe has not been concluded as rapidly as I had hoped. Cynical as ever, he'll have to pay the price. Prestige isn't free, you know. And for the good of the realm it is: the freshly-acquired coin frees me to hire a band of professional mercenaries, the Lithuanian Band, to compensate for Ragutis' failures in the field. The first phase of my plan nears completion. Will you forgive me, darling, for what I have planned for us?

Curses! [Kodere, we now vie for the same set of territories and must inevitably come to blows. If I allow him to continue unopposed he will ruin the careful plans I am laying out for my family legacy. [I have no choice but to declare war](http://i.imgur.com/k5Jakqxh.jpg). At the decisive [Battle of Varviai](http://i.imgur.com/tIdNrMrh.jpg) our armies are victorious against the Curonian menace. Although the conquest of the Curonians had not been factored into my initial plan, the acquisition of their territories should prove advantageous.

Days later, or placated, and she herself is crowned and enthroned as High Chieftess. As I ready my men to depart Zemaitija - to take the fight once more to the Curonians - my wife and I share a tearful, emotional farewell. [A Zemaitijan choir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3subUnkjUHU) performs a traditional song of the city. It is very beautiful; my wife, bedecked in the regalia of her office, is also beautiful.

This is difficult. This is so very difficult for me. But it must be done.

""Goodbye, even when we are separated by the needs of our respective states.""

""I won't despair

I love you

My wife's spymistress

I do what I do for the family. A hundred years from now

My son [rises peacefully](http://i.imgur.com/3q56Rbsh.jpg) to the High Chiefdom of Zemaitija. At all three courts - Zemaitija, [named Kunos after his father](http://i.imgur.com/nG35pG5h.jpg), will one day succeed us all, to unite the Lithuanian High Chiefdoms under a single, mighty banner. But the minds of men have a way of [helping nature to move more quickly](http://i.imgur.com/TkiSmjTh.jpg). I cannot spend my life decaying in the hope of a future I will never see. I do this for the family. I do this for my children, and my children's children. Not for all of them, however; just for those who survive. What's an infant to a mother? Nothing

To celebrate the coronation of my son and heir in Zemaitija, ""your wife would delight in its luxury.""

And she does. Oh, that she returns to the Yatviags to resume her reign. [She was never seen again](http://i.imgur.com/WIoLNFHh.jpg). How fortunate that she produced an heir before the unavoidable incident. Little Kunos.. Kunos Jr. He would be ""Kunos II"", I suppose. He would be the man to unite all three of our realms. In due time, he would become High Chief of Yatviag, Zemaitija, and Lithuania. [The gods favour him and will bless his reign](http://i.imgur.com/8DnWBWmh.jpg).

As I have already said, I must protect the members of my family.

May the gods be good to me.

Borkus is a humble man, the hunchback Butavas. I may very well find room for him at court.

Alright, he was pretty much a failure.  I vow to be ""King Trond the Kind"" reborn! I decide to nominate my uncle, Prince Ossor af Reddit, as heir to Ireland and Wales.  I ask myself, what would Tron do? I think he would do the same.  

July 1157

Unfortunately, I have 24 gold total and my arms is only 890 people. Not even Trond himself could win this, I decide to surrender to both.

[1 Aug 1157](http://i.imgur.com/aGWzlRJ.jpg)

I have already sent my surrender

6 Aug 1157

I am imprisoned by my uncle and can't afford the ransom, Glamorgan, and Gwent in Wales, the English CB claim on Gwynedd is no longer valid, so Ireland keeps it.

7 Aug 1157

My father is my heir and regent

15 Aug 1157

My uncle is my heir again,
well

I get a message that Scotland wants to take Oriel from me.  I plead with Ossor

29 Sept 1157

Uncle Ossor has accepted my request; now I'll sit back and let him fight Scotland

Scotland is reinforcing their already unbeatable army.  This isn't good.

11 Feb 1158

the County of Oriel and the Castle of Dublin are taken...I surrender for the good of my people.

29 Mar 1158

My uncle decided to put me in the oubliette

12 May 1158

My spymaster slips me a note to tell me that a courtier decided to plot to kill me

[2 Feb 1160](http://i.imgur.com/ABzIvEL.jpg)

I become Zealous

A gaoler tells me that Prince Findlay, the elegantly named Grand Mayor Máel-Máedóc I of Leinster.  He's really not that awesome, but his name really does make up for it.  Grand Mayor Cellach I of Meath thinks that the Duchy of Connacht is rightfully his... how about no.

[1 Sept 1161](http://i.imgur.com/GQkl4Wx.jpg)

I dream that there is a revolt in Dyfed and that I don't even have enough levies to defeat them.  I'm sure it was just a dream. 

[15 Feb 1162](http://i.imgur.com/FY73twe.jpg)

I'm Ill

I lose the vote by a landslight to Cathal Mac Carthaigh

I finally got a good strong Irish kingdom by starting with Desmond. After conquering my way through most of Ireland I crowned myself King and the remaining Dukes and Earls bent knee immediately. I only lacked a single providence, well liked, and ready to be king when the time came. My current king had a hunched back, but my first son had no such malady. My second son, on the other hand, had a hunchback and a handful of other negative traits. 

I didn't want hunchbacks being bred into my line

A few years later the current king of Ireland dies

Now my hunchbacked, moron, and a perfectly normal second son. Well, how am I going to fix this so that my line remains pure and unbroken. I struggled a while with killing my wife but she was surprisingly resilient. Fortunately for me, she died on her own not a few months later, and I remarried a very nice HRE princess. NON matrillineally. 

However, but instead that Earl is the King of Scotland when the dust settles. My son and heir to the Kingdom of Ireland is now vassal to the King of Scotland. Due to the marriage, my hair lipped, hunch backed son is also a 2 year old Scottish Duke.  

So now I just have to wait until I have a son, my son's liege, the upstart King of Scotland loses control of his Kingdom in a civil war, and when the dust settles the Duke of Ulster, who had a claim to the Isles, is now the owner of some new Counties in Scotland, and my son is his prisoner. This was the most confusing part, just that when the Scottish war ended I had two new counties via the Duke of Ulster. 

So now my son is no longer vassal to Scotland since his liege was stripped of all lands and titles, who now controlled 7 counties. The Duke of Ulster had every right to imprison my son as a Scottish Duke, but he was also Heir to the Kingdom of Ireland and his future liege. Very confusing. He also wouldn't release my son because my son had a strong claim on two of the counties he now controlled, and this duke was rather ambitious.

In an attempt to free my son, therew the Duke in jail, and put down his rebellionExcept my son was still in jail because I didn't have enough backing to strip him of titles without causing widespread revolt and he still wouldn't release my son. I had already spent a fortune bribing people to like me and keep further rebellion from spreading. Nobody likes a hunch back. 

Tired of the scheming, that was easy enough, I thought, and I'm ready to put all this behind me and focus on bigger things. Except my heir, the first male from my second wife, dies! And I become celibate pining for my first wife. 

Now I have no good male heirs except for my second son from my first wife, and then execute him. My imprisoned, hair lipped, hunched backed, heir and son is now 18 years old, and has been in jail since he was 2 years old. 

And then he dies of illness in jail before I can save up the money to ransom him. That poor hair lipped

My second son from my second marriage, haver of many positive traits, becomes my heir at the age of 18, having never really done anything, held any lands, or titles, or really ever been noticed. At the age of 22 he becomes the King of Ireland, and 2 counties in Scotland. 

Then his mom dies and he inherits more counties in Scotland. I couldn't have planned this if I'd tried. I completely homered my way into the largest Kingdom in Britannia. 

I'm now a eight years into his reign and he is one of my best Kings. All positive traits

Now one of the things I have been focusing on this game is strong vassals. I have put in place tons and tons of kings
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110722340

Now my primary way of creating these vassals has been landing the family. The early Kommenos were prolific breeders and I focused on incumbating my close family to make kids

Of my 17 kings, and Volga Bulgaria) In addition many of my independent dukes and even many of the dukes under my kings are dynasty. 

This has created extreme stability among my kingdoms and duchies as they are all allies. I really noticed this when I had set up a far removed prince of Anatolia as the Duke of Upper Burgundy. He was a 4 year old imbecile and since it was an imperial conquest his counts were old germans who were more loyal to the HRE. I figured him screwed as he had 4 counts against his one county. I attend to other affairs when suddenly I notice Italy, and Rus mobilizing. I check the war and I find out they, in addition to many others had joined the child Duke to protect his territory.

This prompted me to do some further investigation. Every Kommenos has a base of 68 lords in their ally tab. During my early game, and Jerusalem, and Sicily, were primarily made by themselves not me. The Roman Empire simply expands on it own. Sure I do my own aggressive expansion, the map at the beginning of the post was after the end of my war with essentially every Christian ruler left in Europe at the same time. And I just keep putting my dynasty in.

I finally got the GoT mod, as well as trying to see exactly what I can do with this situation.  I married Robb to Margaery Tyrell, started educating Arya with the Greatjon.  I also started training Bran with numbers, and eventually started Richon with Knighthood.  Sansa stayed betrothed to Joffrey, and was trained to be a lady.  All of my vassals join the liege loyalty party, and will stand with me until the end.

I almost immediately started plotting to kill Ramsey Snow, Robert imprisoned Mace Tyrell for no real apparent reason.  About four months later he was beheaded.  Margaery was probably not happy about this, but didn't really say anything. 

About a year later, who was apparently a part of the small council, which is honestly the one place I wouldn’t want to be if my kingdom is about to declare for another king. Aegon’s invasion basically stalls in the Dorish Marshes and he ends up hanging out in Dorne married to Arianne Martell.  

By this point I've married Arya off to Theon, but I imagine that he trusts me.  Basically everyone north of Harrenhal is happy and laughing at the political strife of the South.  Jon Snow has decided to go to Essos, and I happily tell him to find himself and be safe, and that he is welcome back at any point.

Soon after this, they’ll back me on the throne and I’ll inherit his debts to them.  Well, I decide that I’m still loyal to Robert and respectfully decline.  

Anyways, executing people left and right.  We’ve now seen two Lords Paramount executed by this King, and Eddard is starting to feel like the Mad King is back.  I get the option to back Robert, back Tywin, sit it out, or become the King of the North.  At this point, after seeing everything that has happened in the past seven or so years, so he declares independence.  Hail to King Eddard!  King of the North!!

So, and I get ready to move troops south to keep out the Stormlanders.  Now remember, I’ve got Joffrey living in Winterfell, and I get a notice that I can execute him, imprison him, or acknowledge that he has nothing to do with this.  I decide to imprison him.  He has never really done anything too bad to Sansa, and they have two kids at this point.  So

I march south to meet Hoster’s troops while Balon starts sailing south.  Eddard is leading the center column, leads the largest force, the right.  As I reach the neck, I get a notice that Joffrey is demanding trial by combat.  I get the choice of honoring his request, using champions, ignoring him, or executing him.  Well, so he decides to battle Joffrey himself.  After a long battle, rather than execute him.  He can still be a great asset

At this point, north, and east.  I continue the march to the Crownlands, and meet King Robert in battle.  In a massive battle that costs me three-quarters of my troops, Robert is slain.  So ends the tyrannical rein of Robert the Fat.

I decide to let the Southern Lords fight it out while I head back north to my frozen throne.  Once I get back and disband my troops, the entire North falls back under the control of the Iron Throne, along with the Riverlands and the Iron Islands.  I get a notice that the War is over and I have lost.

Eddard gets taken captive by Robert’s troops.  Turns out he’s loyal to King Tommen and was never on my side.  I get a long notification about loyalty and how I’m a traitor to the crown.  In a full screen notice, and I have just led the Riverlands, the Iron Islands, and the North right under his boot.  The game ends as he turns his eye to the Westerlands, and I wish Tywin luck.  Sansa gets to witness a different Baratheon son order the execution of her father, as her fiancé stands there, helping this time rather than giving the order.  

I sat there staring at the screen, all because I trusted the Vale.  Unfortunately, the game ended at this point.  I would have loved to be able to continue playing as Robb, fighting to avenge my father.  It’s too bad that the game decided that everyone in House Stark was persona non grata at that point.  At least Jon got out.  I hope he comes back at some point, leading the Golden Company.

* Hellenic characters can currently take concubines

* Despite being ""reformed""

* Although I don't like the weak conversion rates and the susceptibility of Hellenic characters/regions to missionaries

* The game uses northern pagan terms for Roman Hellenic rulers: Hetman, King, Emperor. There ought to be culturally-unique terms for Roman rulers, as for any other fleshed-out ethnic group in CKII. One might use ""Praetorius Praefecto"" for a subordinate king, ""Princeps"" for an independent king, ""Imperator"" for an Emperor, ""Legatus"" for a baron, ""Proconsul"" for a count

* The only ceremonial titles available to a Roman Hellenic ruler are ""Cupbearer"" and ""Court Jester"". Obviously there are many

* Romans are unable to form the Kingdom of Italy because they are not Christian and are unable to form the Empire of Italia because they are neither Italian nor Christian. Romans are likewise unable to reform the Roman Empire (!!!) because they are not Christian. The checks for certain events need to be rewritten to allow Roman and Hellenic players to restore the glory of the Empire.

* Hellenic pagans get the subjugation cassus belli but have no one to subjugate. Not particularly useful. Hellenic pagans also have no special pagan bonuses to keep them safe from attack like the other pagans do. They also seem to lack the ability to holy war or to call ""crusades"".

* It might be nice if Roman / Hellenic players got the conquest CB that the reformed Roman Empire gets

* The addition of Roman names and surnames is a nice touch. I have no complaints there. The use of the Mediterranean portrait set for Romans is also adequate.

That's all I can think of at the moment. What about you? What are your thoughts? What do you want to see happen to Romans and Hellenic pagans in future patches?

Oh, have clamoured for a Jewish culture or a Jewish religion. If you're going to toss Romans and Hellenism into the game to please the former then you can certainly toss Jews and Judaism into it to please the latter. Once you've willingly added *yet another* superfluous religion to the game, your explanations for omitting Judaism start to sound like prejudice-covering excuses.",,False,self,t5_2tgic,,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1fr2rp/thoughts_on_roman_culture_and_hellenic_paganism/

-----

King Aerys Targaryen and Lord Commander Gerold the White Bull of the Kingsguard met Robert Baratheon on the field of battle southeast of King's Landing. Robert cut down the White Bull and the Mad King as well. Crown Prince Rhaegar inherited the throne and petitioned Lord Tywin of the Westerlands for aid. Rhaegar promised Tywin Lannister the Riverlands if he rallied his banners in support of the crown. Tywin accepted the offer and joined the war to fight for his king.

Rhaegar had a low-key coronation ceremony in King's Landing and then returned to the war. Only 6 months after becoming king, the sixth of his name, inherited the Iron Throne as a baby. His mother died when he was 3 from a weak physique. Ser Alyn was appointed Regent of the Iron Throne and would govern the realm until Aegon came of age. Barristan Selmy became the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and eventually Aegon's guardian. As Aegon grew, Barristan trained him in the ways of sword and shield. However, the Crown apparently never had enough money to pay for a formal education. Aegon's uncle Viserys finally gathered enough to pay for a court education when Aegon was about 9.

Robert Baratheon also slew Lord Mace Tyrell of the the Reach in the same battle where he killed Arthur Dayne and King Rhaegar. The new Lord Paramount of the Reach was young like Aegon and his regent declined to rejoin the war. The Reach soon fell into civil war for several years

Lord Hoster of the Riverlands was slain by Tywin in the decisive Battle of Bramsfort. Tywin later slew the traitor Robert Baratheon during the chaos of the Battle of Maidenpool. Though Tywin lost the Battle of Maidenpool

Tywin was later killed by Lord Eddard of the North at the Battle of Brindlewood, the new Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, rejoined the rebellion. Stannis, Eddard's, and Edmure's forces occupied much of the Crownlands, closing in on King's Landing. The war was heavily in favor of the rebellious Lords Paramount at this time, with them nearing victory. Strategic strikes by Westerlands-Dorne-Royal forces kept dragging the war out until they were finally able to band together and win several decisive victories in the Crownlands.

The seventh year of the war was the turning point in favor of the loyalists. Stannis Baratheon died in an accident (not a suspicious one!)

Advantage shifted to the rebels once more when Tyrion received word from Casterly Rock that Lord Gawen of the Crag started a war to press Cersei Lannister's claim on the Westerlands. Kayce and Golden Road also joined in. The neutral Iron Islands decided this would be a good time to raid the Crag and plunder the western coast of its riches. Tyrion's forces marched back to Casterly Rock to suppress the rebellion and deal with the vicious Ironborn as the North and Riverlands rallied their hosts in Darry and marched on the Crownlands once again.

The diminished loyalist forces went into battle against a 9

Lord Willas arrived just in the nick of time to defeat the rebel forces at the battle of Sow's Horn. With the massive armies of the Reach again fighting in support of the king, the Targaryens remained on the Iron Throne as was their right. House Targaryen and House Baratheon were decimated. Only 7 Targaryens remained alive, and Renly was the last Baratheon. The rebels were brought before the Iron Throne, and young Aegon decided their fate personally:

* Lord Eddard: Lord Eddard was spared and allowed to return to Winterfell. His brother Benjan and sister Lyana remain in King's Landing as guests.
* Lord Renly: Renly was imprisoned and the Castle Rainwood taken from him.
* Lord Edmure: Aegon honored his father's promise and demanded that Edmure forfeit the Riverlands to Tyrion.

Edmure refused the royal command, Edmure was banished to the Night's Watch to serve the realm as a Black Brother. His three year old daughter Lysa Tully inherited Riverrun.

The civil war to place Mya Stone in the Stormlands' Lord Paramountcy ended

After the War of the Usurper ended, he is certain to be a great military ruler. Aegon the Sixth of His Name was officially crowned as King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men; Lord of the Seven Kingdoms; and Protector of the realm at age 15. The coronation ceremony was to be held on Aegon's wedding day, but it was delayed due to the High Speton unexpectedly dying.

For background, holding two Empire titles. [Here's a picture of said game.](http://i.imgur.com/IOJLo.jpg) I wanted to see if I could get Boleslaw to conquer the Reich in his lifetime again; I also decided I'd take a few pretty pictures and see if I couldn't make a guide out of it for any fellow enterprising Poles. As such, what follows is the story of Boleslaw II Piast, asshole of the year, all years.

Note that I lost a few pictures on my way through converting them all to .jpgs (damn saving as bitmaps), nothing too drastically different from vanilla.


**The plan

A few of you might right about now be saying, what precisely *is* this plan of yours?"" Well, that's simple. To the north of Poland there are a horde of pagans: I'm going to take their land and place some nice Polish dukes there instead, and those Dukes are going to give me the levies I need to conquer the Reich. This is the part where you say, ""but that'll take forever!"" And then I retort wittily, ""not if you never stop fighting!""

And this is the part where you tell me I'm a mad, call Kaiser, attack, win war, lower levies, and declare war again, even if there's a truce in effect. This takes advantage of two CK2 mechanics:

**1.** Although you take a prestige hit from breaking a truce no matter what

**2.** An ally will almost always join a holy war, provided they don't refuse a summons.

So, sure, but is it ultimately worth that -70 raised levies opinion you have from declaring war back-to-back for so long (and yes, it does get to -70)? Well, yes. My plan is to conquer the Reich by the Invasion casus belli; to gain this CB, I have to be *very* friendly with the Pope, and have quite a bit of piety to boot. I'm sure you see where this is going.

So


**We begin with...**

[Marriage, of course I'm not doing it because the wench is comely, I'm doing it because of the alliance she provides me. From the very start I intend to conquer the Holy Roman Empire with Boleslaw, and to do that requires a few very specific maneuvers in the early game. First, ironically, you must actually ally with the Reich. Only they have the manpower necessary to help you win the dozens of Holy Wars you're going to be throwing yourself into; in this case, I married the Kaiser's sister. Rather than request the gold, truces will mean *nothing*. Take what Prestige you can get

Before marrying my old lady I took the time to set up my councilors, I might as well go all-out.

Now, unsurprisingly, his 10,000 men steamroll the Romuvan resistance with naught but a little help from my own levies and [wins me the war by mid-1068](http://i.imgur.com/zDZwJ.jpg?1). For the first war, this isn't a bad timetable. I throw my court chaplain over there to convert the local heathens and pat myself on the back.

Now, two reasons. First, Mecklenburg borders the single-county Lubeck, which is easy pickings. The newly-landed Duke of Mecklenburg, whoever it is, has a chance to fabricate a claim on that county, and more land is never a bad thing. A more pressing reason, is that the King of Denmark and the Kaiser himself both eye Mecklenburg early-game. If you take it you prevent it from being held by either of those two--we are trying to keep the Kaiser weak

With Mecklenburg now added to the great Kingdom of Poland it comes time for me to land vassals in my newly-conquered territory. When choosing bishops, [as is evident by how much the Pope likes me](http://i.imgur.com/rwnVO.jpg?1). I could've had good ol' Heinrich excommunicated right then and there, but I don't yet have enough piety to even request and Invasion and, well... it would go badly for me even if I did. 1500 troops total, anyone?

So, then attack the now-count of that once-proud land. Losing the 100 prestige for breaking truce is worth [letting the Kaiser win me the war with his doomstack and subsequently] gobbling up half of Pomerania--which I rapidly follow up with another holy war, this time on the Duke of Pomerania himself, for none other than the remnants of the Duchy of Pomerania under his control. At the end of this third Holy War I fulfill my ambition to become a Paragon of Virtue, as is evidenced by [the Pope being even more willing than before to excommunicate Heinrich](http://i.imgur.com/SCKbl.jpg?1). It's like he's baiting me, the cheeky bastard. But luckily I know I'd get slapped down so hard I wouldn't live to see straight again and restrain myself; conquering the Salian line comes later.

Some images got lost here, his timing was fairly ideal; there's an infant Queen of Sweden and a new King of Denmark, so they're unlikely to try any holy wars against my soon-to-be-destroyed northern neighbors, and letting my vassal levies rest gives me time to implement Max City Levies and Low Crown Authority, perfect for later conquest.

As soon as the Kaiser's back from his trip to Hungary I get right back up and force him to get up with me, except for one [oddly hilarious case of William de Normandie trying to conquer England in 1085](http://i.imgur.com/wcsvK.jpg?1) (he failed). Simply suffice it to say that between '72 and '86 [I was a very busy Pole](http://i.imgur.com/xzRvn.jpg?1). Of course, even with the military centralization in the form of laws and building prep I was doing during this period (such as building castle villages and whatnot, upgrading my economy) Heinrich still did most of the work. He's really a Godsend; it's too bad I'm going to kick his dynasty's ass, he's been a real grade-A chum, helping me beef up for the sole purpose of destroying his family and whatnot. Great guy.

Now you'll notice that the evil scumbag Dane-Swede confederacy have moved in and cockblocked my total control of the Lithuanian duchies there. ""But Snigaroo, *ever*!"" you insist. Well, yes, actually, you're completely right, but I like to have my Kingdom be nice and orderly, especially when it comes to integration of duchies into a Kingdom. Perhaps the [duchies mapmode](http://i.imgur.com/8s0wQ.jpg?1) will help illustrate my anal-retentive angst against the viking threat. It will certainly help illustrate just how long I've been at war; it's a testament to Boleslaw's stats that none of his vassals are pondering rebellions right about now. Or, it's a testament to me being very free with duchies and counties

Striking after the death of the ruler is ideal as the new ruler is unlikely to command the same loyalty and thus may suffer from smaller levies and/or internal revolts. And since you waited for them to die, shorter-lived rulers. 

Also don't forget that when YOUR character dies, since the truce was nullified on your end.

They tell me that there is a big war! They tell me this a lot. And every time they tell me they take my kittens away and bring me into this big room where everyone is telling each other about how big this war is. Why can't I just play with the kittens?

Everyone is sad today. Two of my playmates

Hurrah! Today is my fourth birthday! There was a big feast

20 - 26 October

The whole court is in an uproar. Someone killed some far away [despot](http://i.imgur.com/1xRqH3D.jpg). I didn't hear about this until they told me two of my cousins also died

***

[27 November

I saw someone die today. One of the nannies. I tried my best to be a good Basileus and not cry but there was a lot of blood everywhere. I overheard my nannies talking with my “uncle” Neophytos that they should send me away for my own good. I don't want to leave!

***

[8 June

My nana and nannies were all there today at the docks. Apparently I am going to some place called “Portogalia” to live with an uncle and my cousin Arsenios. I was allowed to bring as many toys as I want though and *all* my kittens

***

[7 November

My uncles are always complaining about my other uncles. I overheard one saying something about a “regent

***

[17 November

Arsensios brought me into his study today for a special history lesson. He told me all about House af Reddit and why we have such a funny name. (I mean it's not even Greek!) Our long ago ancestors were a mighty warrior people who came from far to the north. But their lands were poor and so they conquered richer lands on islands to the west, and his father before him, and his before him, worked long and hard to ensure peaceful rule in the Empire, even though many conspired against them. He said their work was done now and it was up to me to bring glory the house and to bring all of Europe under the enlightened rule of House af Reddit!

***

[14 May

My cousin Anakomos showed up unannounced a few weeks ago but my uncle thought not much of it. Today I was surprised to see my uncle Neophytos (who Arsensios told me was never really my uncle)  to appear in the grand hall as we all thought he was very busy back east. He came bursting through the doors with the household guard and pointed straight at Anakomos. He quickly made his way up to my uncle, while I overheard Anakomos shouting some rather nasty things.

***

[18 February

I was thinking today while in the palace garden about those history lessons Arsensios had given. I was destined for great things. To be greater than Arsenios himself, the Bishop of Rome! These other children I play with are nothing next to me, me who sits higher than their own father!

***

[19 December

The Count of Rama, but as I recall it was my regent who forbid me to take up jousting until I was sixteen as well! I would show him just how well of a jouster I could be!

I ran around the corridors on my (stick..) horse, missing with my broom pole. He was knocked straight off the balcony and landed straight on top of a statue in the garden several floors below. I made a hasty retreat.

***

[20 December

Rumours were flying around the court of an assassin. I knew otherwise. I also knew to keep my mouth shut unless I wanted the strap. Some way to treat a Basileus! I was told that being a senior member of House af Reddit and an esteemed member of my council

***

[19 March

I demanded of Arsenios that I be allowed to train and joust with the other boys, but gave me a wooden sword and shield anyway. I had some practice with a tutor but never fought against the other boys. The sergeant matched me up with a boy he said to be only one year my senior but I thought that a bold faced lie! I prepared to fight anyhow and kept my mouth shut. Blow after blow glanced off my shield and it hurt even through the wood. I was too slow and he connected with a hard knock to my head with his sword. I fell to the ground, the world a blur. The next second I could see the older child coming at me again so I lunged at his feet, bringing him to the ground with me. The sergeant yelled something and then was in between us the next moment. He laughed and said he would speak to Arsenios about my returning to the training grounds.

***

25 April

I had a fine time the other day making hell for the kitchen staff! I raided their pantry for sweets and found where they kept all the fine crystal and silver. One dared tell me what to do! I threw a [goblet](http://i.imgur.com/nUElbn1.jpg) at his feet for his trouble and shattered into a thousand fine pieces. Then today when Arsensios heard of what I did I was in for quite the [beating](http://i.imgur.com/UNR6v0c.jpg). He would not stop until I told him what I did wrong. Perhaps there are limits to what I can and can't do

***

[21 May

Another child thought he could come and take an old toy horse of mine. The gall of it

***

[23 January

I have been informed that some petty dukes are unhappy with their king and would rather live under the wise rule of af Reddit! Perhaps these dukes may be petty

***

[21 August

I have come down with some dreadful disease! Is this some divine punishment? Have I done something to offend God? My innards seem to want to leave my body and are doing their best. I can not keep anything down. I am seen day and night by the house maids and a barber who leeches me daily but none of it seems to help.

***

[24 August

I am told of a glorious victory over the heathen Moslems to the east. They are holding a great Triumph apparently honouring me for this victory. They asked me to come back east to preside over the Triumph despite my illness. I declined, so I agreed to the dreadful voyage. Surely God must be testing me.

***

[9 November

I made an appearance at the Triumph, telling me all I had to do was show up and recognized the great sacrifice I made to take the voyage. Soon enough though the vomiting ceased, followed by the other end. I've never felt more alive! I have survived God's trial. This must be a sign of great things to come as my sixteenth birthday fast approaches and the regency shall officially be over!

***

[31 March

The regency has ended and I am in full command of the mighty Roman Empire and the destiny of House af Reddit! It seems the war for Oualía has been all but won, awaiting the end of her own regency and her sixteenth birthday.

***

26 May

The war in Oualía has been won and the [crown handed over to me](http://i.imgur.com/kAXasyp.jpg). The Triumph was truly God's work, but their armies were no match in size or quality of our Roman Legions!

Later that day

***

[11 August

I have been entertaining a distant kinsman in court for the past weeks and finally my efforts have come to fruition. Swayed by the obvious might and benevolent rule of the Roman Empire

***

7 September

The business of the realm hums along nicely. A war rages in Ireland but I am confident in the ability of my Marshal to handle it. Instead I have devoted much of my time to [gardening](http://i.imgur.com/qGfUh2h.jpg), and indeed when another court entertains me I ask that I might have a look at their gardens and even suggest projects for their improvement!

***

[12 August

Glory to House af Reddit and praise Jesus! My wife has given me a daughter. I still ask God for a son

6 April

No sooner had I learned that the lords of Anglía were unhappy with their lord and wished to [install me](http://i.imgur.com/U85OIs7.jpg) as their rightful king

Alright

I nominate my sister as my heir and decide to fire my old chancellor who was doing an atrocious job.  His replacement is incredible, but regardless...I choose a courtier with huge skill in diplomatic relations. He’s also possessed, so hopefully that doesn't bite me in the ass. 

**21 Dec 1167**

I am now Irish – continuing the fine tradition of my family seemingly changing cultures every fortnight.  Norwegian, and now Irish.  Also I have been commissioning the building of improvements in many of my holdings starting with the castle towns.

**27 Jul 1170**

The King of Brittany has declared war for Wales.  It wouldn't be all that big of a deal

**6 Feb 1171** 

I have usurped the kingdom of Ireland.  If I am going to lose Wales

**27 Apr 1171** 

Wales and Glamorgan have been lost in this war.

**11 Sept 1171** 

I have decided to marry my sister and heir to the Holy Roman Emperor

**10 Feb 1173** 

My regency is over and I have become so skilled in diplomacy that I am a Grey Eminence. I have married Princess Helene of the Byzantine Empire just in case the HRE decides to push my sister's claim. Besides it can't hurt to be allied to both Romes.

**11 May 1173** 

I have invited Robert de Normandie to my court as he has a claim to the Duchy of Munster which is currently held by the old king of Ireland. I plan on building a barony and giving it to Robert then press his claim to Munster.

**11 Aug 1173** 

My sister has died and I am no longer allied with the HRE.

**4 Nov 1173** 

My wife is pregnant.

**5 June 1174** 

I have a son and named him Patrick. 

**2 Jan 1176** 

I am now in an embargo war with the Duke of Munster

**13 Jun 1176** 

I have surrendered. They were simply too much for me.

**26 Oct 1177** 

I am now known as the fat. Lovely.  I decide to try and get Medium Crown authority but the votes are slightly short.

**5 March 1178** 

I now have a daughter I have named her Helene after her mother. Fortunately his Imperialness the Holy Roman Emperor has yet to be married I suggested a betrothal to my newborn daughter and he accepted.

**2 Feb 1179** 

Medium Crown authority has finally been approved. 

**7 Mar 1179** 

I have also gotten small Feudal tax through. Should help with my war chest.

**13 July 1179** 

I have a new son I have named Peter

**10 Aug 1180** 

My mother Helen has passed away.  May she rest in peace.

**16 Jan 1181** 

My old wound finally caught up to me. Never should have tried to assassinate my aunt a decade ago.  I have passed on to the next life.

1359385543.0,17filz,A lazy guide to making a republic in CK2 ,wrrrry,36,5,12,"I'm aware most of you probably have never tried to mod this game

However I also know a lot of you would probably like to create a different republic and play as them



**Step 1. Find Your Mark**

Let's look for where you want your republic to be, Caspian and Aral Seas sorry).

I will be following this with an example

We will need the Mark's Character details. Look for who owns the desired duchy/kingdom in the game and write down their first name and birthday (you can see this by hovering over their age). In this instance I'm looking at Dirk

We also need to note down the provinces he owns and the names of the cities in these provinces. Technically we only need to know the capital province

In this instance, and Westfriesland which has the city of Hoorn.

So I've got all that written down now, and is count of Holland (City is Dordrecht), and Westfriesland (City is Hoorn).



**Step 2. Find our Mark's Details**

We'll need to find this guy (no gals allowed as Republics unfortunately due to paradox's game design) in the game files to get some information. Find your Crusader Kings 2 folder (where you installed it

This folder is split between cultures/regions so you'll need to find which one is most relevant to your Mark. In this case I know Dirk is in the Duchy of Holland

In the relevant file we want to search for our Mark. There will probably be multiple people with the same first name

Once we've found them in the files

The Character ID will be the open bracket just above his name. For Dirk

The Dynasty ID is just below

We will also need the characters culture and religion which like dynasty are just below the name. For Dirk this is culture of ""dutch"" and religion of ""catholic"". These are CASE SENSITIVE so don't write it down as Dutch/Catholic.

So Dirk is Character number 106520



**Step 3. Makin' the mod**

We should have most of the information we need

Go to the folder - My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/

Create a folder in here called ""mod"" (without quotes). In this new /mod/ folder create a new text file called ""MyRepublic"" and a new folder called ""MyRepublic"".

In this text file we just made

&gt;name = ""My Custom Republic Mod""

&gt;path = ""mod/MyRepublic""

After that we want to rename this text file to MyRepublic.mod, just you'll need to right click it and specifically open it with notepad.



**Step 4. Creating the merchant house - Part 1/2**

In this new /mod/MyRepublic/ folder

Create a new text file in this /landed_titles/ folder. You can call it anything except landed_titles.txt (that's the vanilla game file)

In this file we want to make an entry for this character's patrician house. The example I will use for Dirk is as below.

&gt; b_gerulfing = {

&gt; 	culture = dutch

&gt; 	religion = catholic

&gt; }

The b_xxxx name is the titular title of the patrician house. It can be named anything except one that already exists (eg. b_dandolo for the Dandolo family in Venice

Culture and religion are pretty obvious



**Step 5. Creating the merchant house - Part 2/2**

Go back up to the /mod/MyRepublic/ folder

We'll be making a new text file for the Patrician title we just created above. For the example of Dirk

In that new text file we need to make an entry defining our new Patrician house. For our example of Dirk it will be the following:

&gt;1066.9.15={

&gt;	holding_dynasty = 432 

&gt;	liege=""d_holland""

&gt;	holder=106520

&gt;}

So I've put in the date that I wanted

In this example, you'll need to look through the list of them in your Crusader Kings II/history/titles folder. It should be easy enough to find but let me know if you can't find it and I'll look it up for you.



**Step 6. Provinces Turning Castles into Cities**

In the /mod/MyRepublic/history/ folder

We need to head back to the actual CK2 folder with all the game files now, this was Holland and Westfriesland, which are ""80 - Holland.txt"" and ""81 - Westfriesland.txt"" respectively.
If you can't seem to find yours don't panic, the order of provinces isn't random so provinces are grouped up by general area in this folder. If you're really having trouble just ask me and I'll find out for you.

We're going to copy the files of all these provinces and paste them in this new mod/MyRepublic/history/provinces folder we just made. For Dirk this is ""80 - Holland.txt"" and ""81 - Westfriesland.txt""

When I open up ""80 - Holland.txt"" I can see the line: b_dordrecht = city. If we remember back

&gt; 1066.9.15 = { capital = b_dordrecht }

When I searched before

You do not need to do this for all your provinces


**Step 7. Test it.**

Now is the moment of truth, as it's not listed in the republic. I could add that step in this but I'm trying to make this as small a guide as possible, so ask me in comments if you're interested in that step.

If you're having issues



**Notes:**

This was the quickest and easiest way I thought to show you all how to make a republic in the existing map

That's ~~seventeen~~, and he has a granddaughter — eighteen daughters across two generations. I managed to set up some matrilineal marriages to keep the dynasty going a little bit, but still no sons. The *only* son we've managed to produce is Steffen, but he was sired by some Welsh cad and is not of our line.

I figure the odds of this happening by chance are somewhere past 200

I also can't help but note that the last son fathered by anyone in House Ua Cheinnselaig was a bastard. And given his name

Perhaps she carried a grudge. Might she have hired some sort of gypsy to put a curse on the entire House Ua Cheinnselaig? That would be some strong magic indeed.

Well, as well as handing out all the kingdom titles in the empire. At least the kings of Anatolia and Armenia seem content with their lot in life, but the heretic King of England is pretty pissed. I promptly proceed to revoke his title and hand it out to someone more suitable, starting a civil war that will last 8 years.

[1 jan  1310](http://i.imgur.com/A0zFobT.jpg) 

I’ve inherited a nice war for a single county against the Syrian Sultanate

[26 jan 1310](http://i.imgur.com/8KWAASj.jpg) 

Our beloved half-sister has married the heir to the kingdom of Cyprus. Great

The king of Jerusalem thoroughly hated my guts

14 april 1311

I have contracted and been cured from slow fewer on the same day.  Must be my royal blood.

[20 nov 1312](http://i.imgur.com/LZdsMjK.jpg)

I seem to have pushed the wrong claim. Some fellow named Torgeir Amundsson is now the King while the lazy nitwit who’s claim I meant to press is still hanging out in Tortosa. At least my sister managed to find her way to the throne of Sweden like she was supposed to.

[9 feb 1317](http://i.imgur.com/zCY9I4w.jpg) 

My first independence war! It feels like my initiation into the af Reddit family.

[25 dec 1318](http://i.imgur.com/ELbQpWu.jpg) 

My regency has ended! And on such a symbolic day no less. Surely this must be a sign of good things to come. Hopefully they don’t require any decent stats.

[4 march 1320](http://i.imgur.com/kvfKmWs.jpg) 

Somehow an Yngling has found his way back to the throne of Norway. At least he’s my vassal.

[25 aug 1320](http://i.imgur.com/wDsHt9J.jpg)

[27 march 1342](http://i.imgur.com/2s3fFic.jpg)

a! After having fired many pathetic chancellors and decades of waiting I have finally managed to convince the world of my rightful claim on Pisa. Those greedy bastards with their funny hats will have to relinquish their grasp on all those nice tradeposts of theirs now.

The Empire of Britannia is on the brink of collapse.

The young Emperor Finn I is desperately looking for a way to keep his Family's nation together.

16 year old Finn was never born to be Emperor. It's something his older brother Daniel wanted. But, the Ill-ruler, Connor II, the responsibility was thrown at him.

In this time of uncertainty

Both Finn and Daniel would often listen to their father tell them about the heroics of their ancestors. Connor would often speak highly of the man who ended the Blood Wars, who died at age 28 and left the throne to their grandfather.

Finn would later decide to read more about the Blood War. And search for the way to hold his Empire together in the books of old...


About 100 years prior the Empire went through a series of grabs for power which has been grimly called the Great Blood War because the family members fighting

The beginning years of the era saw massive rebellions resulting in the SECOND EMPEROR, not all was lost. But for Dúnchad, the Throne would never again be his.

His son, now held by his younger brother, Aèd.

Gabrán would spend the majority of his life preparing for a war he would have no part in, had Gabrán excommunicated and subsequently imprisoned, where Gabrán would die at age 32.

His son, with assistance from the other Kings, would lead a massive rebellion against the granddaughter of Aéd, Empress Dervorgilla I. Who, at the time her reign began, was only 5 years old.

By the time of this war, by War's end, Lukas stood victorious over the Usurpers who dared call themselves Royalty. At age 26, Lukas was crowned Emperor Lukas the Noble.

The Reign of Emperor Lukas the Noble was a much welcomed reign of peace and prosperity

But, 1027 at age 56. With his death his son, Iacob, rose HIS flag in rebellion. Claiming the throne as his and fought against his brother, the inept Emperor Carlus I.

Carlus was not the great leader his father was. And he shared the same fate his grandfather did and lost the throne his father fought so hard to retrieve.

King Carlus didn't seem to mind, who would reclaim her throne and passed the throne to Muirchertach I, who, within a year of his reign, would be assassinated by his cousin, the now Emperor Hoël I(it says III but he was the first Hoël on the throne)

Hoël's reign was immediately challenged by the rightful Emperor, and his daughter and only heir, would both die young and leave the throne to Emperor Carlus II the Handsome, father to the Ill-Ruler.

**The diary of King Nadbor 'the Forlorn' d'Isigny**


[**31 January
 

I have inherited the Kingdom of Syria from my father.  During my studies I learned the history of the house d’Isigny
 

While it is true that my great house once ruled much of the lands around me
 

 

[**1 February
 

I sent a large gift to the Khan in hopes that it will by me some time.  While it pains me to hand so much gold to those who do not follow the LORD I fear I have no choice.
 

 

[**13 February
 

I was to study under the Bishop Osmond
 

 

[**14 February
 

Great news! The fair Duchess of Bourbon has agreed to a betrothal.  Soon we will be able to regain land in France.  Let us hope the godless armies that surround us can continue to be bought off with shiny trinkets.
 

 

**1 March
 

A large revolt started in Bira today
 

 

[**13 March
 

The Knights Templar ask to build a new castle in Acre
 

 

[**15 November
 

Today I have become a man.  I am finally able to start changing some of the very harsh laws that are on the books
 

 
[**5 December
 

I married the lovely duchess Rosa.  My house is one step closer to returning to France.  I will begin straightaway trying to consummate this marriage and produce an heir.
 

 

[**5 April
 

Still working on getting my new wife pregnant
 

 

[**5 August
 

Successfully dispatched the Mayor
 

 

[**17 August
 

The Mongol threat continues to spread West
 

 

[**8 October
 

I have received word that my wife is with child
 

 

[**9 May
 

The LORD has delivered to me a healthy daughter; she will be named Emelenine after my Norman Great-Grandmother.  I realize that I was raised in a Polish household; I would like all my children to get back to our Norman roots.
 

 

[**1 December
 

Curses! The Khan has decided to declare war on me.
 

It only took two attempts to have the heathen Kahn murdered. I was hoping to start an internal conflict due to rumors that his son and heir is a sodomite.
 

 

[**26 January
 

I have raised a force and will try to attack the smaller segments of the Kahn's army before they can combine.
 

 

[**3 May
 

My attempts proved futile
 

 

[**19 July
 

A little too late
 

 

[**1 August
 

An infidel in my court? I think NOT!
 

 
[**24 March
 

I was able to take back the lands of Damascus
 

 

[**27 January
 

One of my courtiers attempted to woo me with carnal pleasures
 

 

[**9 May
 

God bless
 

 

[**24 October
 

I was too slow to put down a rebellion in Damascus and I will lose it to the Egyptian Sultanate
 

 

[**2 May
 

Because of my love of holy literature I have become quite the scholar
 

 

[**15 September
 

The Egyptians have declared war on me
 

 

[**16 November
 

The Kaiser and other fellow Catholics are coming to my aide; we will need GOD's full blessing to fight back these Muslims!  But I have a rising fear in my gut that even with this force we are no match for the Egyptians.  If I lose Acre I will have no land and my house will fade into nothingness.  I must think of a way to get out of this
 

 

[**9 March
 

I ... I have done a terrible thing.  To insure that my son would inherit land in France I had my wife murdered.  It was truly the hardest decision I have ever had to make.  It goes against ever moral fiber in my body.  But it must be done to insure the future of my dynasty.  I know that God can forgive me but I don’t know if I can ever forgive myself for what I have done.

Hey guys, so I went onto JSTOR to see if there was anything useful I could give you instead. This article looked promising.. it seems to be about Talbot. Sorry to let you down, guys, but there's not a lot on him.. this was the best I could find.

""...If you will permit me, so forgive me - as I know you so often do - for any incoherence that may manifest itself in my speech. 

As you'll recall, many of you were hoping for that - but we do have a few minor artifacts from the early and pre-Norman periods, including a small clutch of written documents that appear to have been deliberately buried. We've yet to examine all of the papers but it appears that they originate from the court of Talbot the Forgettable.

Now, but there's enough evidence to suggest that he played a positive role.

Syria at this time was in a precarious position. Our forebears were trapped between Persia in the east, both Persia and Egypt had experienced regime changes around this time - the Hizirid dynasty seizing Persia in 1164 and the ad-Daula family taking Egypt in 1154. Whether the peace seen under Talbot's reign can be attributed to his statesmanship or to the instabilities inflicted upon his enemies by chance are unknown.

[**We know that at the coronation of Henry I that the Maison de Souris looked something like this**](http://imgur.com/a/OzgFK). Much of that construction was new at the time; Talbot commissioned a number of building works during his brief reign at Farkale. In all we can probably estimate that there were about thirty nobles in residence at the Maison de Souris at the time of his death in addition to approximately fifteen-hundred professional soldiers and guards.

We also know that Talbot had maintained tied with the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of the Greeks. His late sister, and his own bastard daughter, the lowborn Stephanie, had been wed patrilineally to Prince Staurkios, a son of Leon the Great. And although enmity existed between them over a claim to the Syrian throne, Talbot was still joined to the Duke of Burgundy through the latter's marriage to his sister, Adelheid. All of this is corroborated with documents from later reigns.

Only four years before his death, as well as with Duke Herman the Wise of Mosul, husband to his eldest daughter, Constantine. The three of them remained locked in his dungeons until the day that he died.

Talbot, such that by the time that he died more half of the living members of those branches of the family were Norman.

...alright, perhaps, or an inscription, or some sort of marketable art - you'll be sure to hear about it in one of our circulations...[**in the meantime, here is his obituary picture.**](http://i.imgur.com/b47miVc.jpg)""

[7 June

Well

Anyways

[8 July

Here I am writing again in this confounded journal. I ""repented my sins"" just because everyone hates me if not. It cost a pretty coin as well. 

[2 June

I forgot about this journal. I can never seem to find it when I want to write in it. I found it today when I was banging by head against the wall after I heard the news that 3/4 of my empire had revolted in favor of my brother. It fell from the ledge above and now here I am writing in it again.

A short description of what has happened since the last entry. I decided to purge my empire of undesirables. Those who qualify for this esteemed distinction are people who do not like or are orthodox. I have found a way to be rid of these people Thanks to my bureaucrats I can revoke Ducal titles at my whim. It is jolly good fun really. 

Anyways

[10 June

My dear brother has died in a tragic accident. How terrible. 

[21 April

Oh

[23 September

My sister has met her end. Not by my hand

[7 December

My illegitimate son. Only my love and I know this. My dear brother thinks it is his. Fool. I shall do what I can for him

[29 July

What have I been doing? Letting women off easy while men are maimed for life? Taking things from people who deserve them simply to satisfy my current whim?This... I am sorry for this if I have wronged you.

[25 January

I almost ate a man's head today. Bloody hell.

[1 October

Well

[25 December

I have finally had a son after 8 daughters and 3 wives. Praise be God!

[12 June

So much death for so little gain. Why can this not be easier? Why do they have to fight me so? All I want is what is rightfully mine...

[12 December

My son has sent an assassin after me. It is justified, as she is dead. Hopefully he marries some young tart.

[3 December

I knew I was done when I started coughing a bit too much. Let the world bow before you

First, they have a defensive attrition bonus, can raid, and can use conquest and subjugation CBs but no holy war. Unlike other pagans, raising levies will upset vassals, short reign penalties are normal and you have access to ultimogeniture succession laws to keep your demesne together. Oh, and the Mandé cultural retinue is pretty amazing. It's a combination of light infantry and archers, and each unit only costs 1 towards the retinue cap so you can have a shit-ton of them.

Geographically, surrounded by muslims, and there is essentially no West African pagan on the map outside of Mali. So once you've united that kingdom, you're on your own. No marriage with infidels means no alliances and no land gain through inheritance. Good luck taking on the muslim hordes at your door.

So our tale begins in 867, forcing me to spend the next hundred years or so building support inside the kingdom. Once I control every single province in the realm except for the queen's own county, I make my move: start a faction for independence (which is promptly granted without a fight), then use my subjugation CB against the queen. She stands no chance, and the Zuwa become rulers of Mali. At this point we're in ~960, and it's time to break free from subsaharan Africa...

... Which won't happen until about 300 years later. Turns out I don't stand any chance against the sultanate of Mauretania in a direct offense. First they try invade me, but with all these bonuses I win the fight and pursue them until I can force a white peace.

However I still can't break out of Mali unless Mauretania is having a crisis, but won't do shit against the Arabs. 

So, so it's one county at a time. If I'm lucky and several neighbouring counts go independent at one time, I can maybe get 2 counties during one Arabian crisis. Which happens every decade or so. So the next few centuries are spent playing the waiting game, very slowly but steadily taking over Mauretania and hoping the Caliph doesn't decide to retaliate. He never does. My chancellor is a pro.

Around that time, one West African county outside of Mali. The Canarias islands are apparently populated by fellow pagans, and they've been left alone since 867. Conveniently enough, they're led by a countess whom I promptly marry. Also conveniently enough, she can't build up tech, so she amassed an *enormous* fortune she can't spend. Further, having the islands fall into my demesne means I'll *finally* be able to build ships and raid properly.

And that's pretty much the gist of it went. The hardest part at least. I conquered counties in a straight line across the West African holy sites, the Arabs had been kicked out of most of Mauretania so I didn't have to be afraid of them quite as much. Andalusia, the second major Sunni power in the area had just been reduced to practically nothing by a successful crusade. Slow but steady blobbing ensued until I held all of Africa, Iberia, and Sicily.

Might as well post the endgame maps and some further comments:

[Maps](http://imgur.com/a/h2WTJ)

Other highlights: 

I briefly had a [white Mansa of Mali](http://i.imgur.com/64vgImC.jpg). A Frankish adventurer tried to take Canarias and was repelled. I kept his wife and daughters as concubines

Counterintuitively, which will make her sons Mirzas. I haven't yet found a way to become a Sayyid myself. At least, it certainly isn't possible through concubines.

The concubinage system leads to some [pretty](http://i.imgur.com/THE2bat.jpg) [fucking](http://i.imgur.com/K6boQbf.jpg) [sad](http://i.imgur.com/UAW1m2t.jpg) [situations](http://i.imgur.com/OPcR2sz.jpg). Seriously

I was counting on the mongols to carve a path of destruction through the Arabian empire and make things easier for me. So *of course* they didn't. The Ilkhanate went north into Cumania instead of south into Persia. Then the Golden Horde just kicked their ass into irrelevance. [And then they went full retard.](http://i.imgur.com/Xhludzx.jpg)

... Let us turn now to the last of the great Norman families that swept the Medieval world, though being forced from their ancestral homes in Syria to Francia, and finally to Sicily, never went extinct, unlike the afromentioned de Hauteville, and never lost power, again unlike the House de Normandie. Indeed it became a common rumor in European courts of the time to speak of the d'Isigny vault, even the blood of their own line. Of course such circulations have long tarnished the name of d'Isigny

... By the dawn of the 15th century the House d'Isigny however was not what it once was. Let us turn now to the reign of [King Eustache 'the Hypocrite'](http://i.imgur.com/p8JMPcD.jpg)...

**20th October

Today Father died, Duchy of Bourbon, &amp; independence from the crown to Niketas, a distant cousin through our ancestral father King Torf the Unyielding, who has a shaky claim to the Duchy of Potiu through his wife, Èmelenine. We cannot afford to be brought into another conflict in Francia, and I particularly do not wish to be drawn into the [civil war](http://i.imgur.com/SEuAMrU.jpg) between [my dear cousin Lambert](http://i.imgur.com/JcjYWOq.jpg), and his [far-flung Capetian cousin Thiébaut II](http://i.imgur.com/XYTt29u.jpg)

I then decided to revoke the Duchy of Cynecia from Duke Vincentello, is married to Countess Carola of Foggia, who is in turn as well the Heiress of the Barony of Termoli. This makes the House d'Appiano almost as powerful as that of the royal d'Isigny within the realm. Though my feudal vassals will not appreciate this, I fear I have no choice. I shall hold on to his title until a more appropriate claimaint comes to my attention.

As well I reorganized my Father's small council. I have appointed Zacharias, respectively. I have sent them all new assignments, primarily on the isle of Sicily.

Finally, as my Father has shown me in this world of wickedness and sin can come about at any moment. Turold certainly would make for a better ruler than his younger brother, [Fraunk](http://i.imgur.com/JTI2578.png), who despises me, his own Father, in a way no good Christian child should. However the experinces of my own good-Father have taught me that alliances come easily in peace, and even being an upright Christian ruler will not mean that the Holy Father in Rome itself won't turn against you. My Father was a good Christian man, as well as Pope Callixtus II before him, my Father was a good man

... I will allow Turold to marry for love

There I met a man named William who had been imprisoned for the [crime of Heresy](http://i.imgur.com/kdUPARY.png). He actually believes that there is but one Sacrament, even going so far as to refuse to eat the flesh of animals. While I do not agree with what he says, I cannot find a fault in his faith. I have prayed hard for his salvation these past few nights.

**7th of February

A [delegate from the Byzantine Empire arrived today](http://i.imgur.com/IpQ1YCQ.jpg),' was attempting to strengthen the power of the crown within his realm. I politely listened to, and then politely refused, the messengers' request for a vote on the matter, as the Greek emperor's still believe my land to rightfully belong to them.

**6th of September

[Victory!](http://i.imgur.com/67GDCD2.png). Duke Hamelin has defeated the Francians, who herself has been imprisoned by Lambert for several years.

**26th of September

Word has reached me of another victory in Krete

**7th of September

[Duke Niketas](http://i.imgur.com/RvsyVHq.png) has joined our war!

**8th of September

Lady Khulan sought me out on the battlefield this morning to tell me that young [Richenda had insulted her](http://i.imgur.com/jVmxUeT.jpg). Doesn't she know I have better things to do!? Is she so soft that the words of a mere child can bring her to tears!? Why did my Father bring such weak vermin into his court I shall never know.

**21st of January

In order to finace this war I have appointed [Ossor as my new Steward](http://i.imgur.com/hCz4Kq5.jpg)

**8th of March

The lords of Sicily loyal to Marguerite have attacked Duke Hamelin in Lecce with an enourmous army equally as strong as the Duke's. I fear and pray every day for word of a victory to arrive..

**5th of April

[The worst has come true](http://i.imgur.com/zdZwVYb.png). I feel weak

**14th of May

Finally

**24th of June

I have placed [Turold at the head of a might force](http://i.imgur.com/90NbWZY.jpg)

**15th of September

In seems the peasants prefer Ossor's reign as Stewart over that of Turold. Perhaps he shall stay on my council even after the war..

**16th of October

It appears that Hamelin &amp; Turold were successful in Lecce, even for innocent runners &amp; carriers.

**4th of November

I [greive for Antonio's](http://i.imgur.com/ikVfnry.png) widow, Ansur, but part of me thanks GOD that it was not Turold. Does that make me a bad person? I shall have to pray on this tonight.

**21st of November

It appears as though the Serbs of Dioclea have eleced my dear brother, [and he has agreed to join our war.](http://i.imgur.com/dl6RWwS.png)

**31st of December

On this somber New Year I tried to [warn Richenda](http://i.imgur.com/gIu1kMh.jpg) about the dangers of Gluttony, King Bertran. This message was perhaps lost on her though, as my illustrious ancestor was a great warrior-king.

1376147455.0,1k3aoz,An idea regarding crusades,Fafnesbane,34,6,20,"So I was thinking of ways to make Crusades a bit more fun and came up with this idea.

Crusades would be more like prepared invasions and an event chain like the hajij for Muslims

If you do join then you start spreading the word to your vassals and the people, so that you can't abuse it against your christian rivals. Then you have, like with a prepared invasion, a time limit in which you have to join the war. If you don't then you get a massive piety hit and get a lot of angry vassals and peasants and if you join the war you get a regency. 

Then you'd march towards the crusade target, like '' You arrive in the enemy city where you are greeted by large buildings that dwarf those in your homeland, you tell you engineers to study these building.'' and then you'd get technology points. Or your enemies fight with tactics that you haven't seen before, you tell your tacticians to study the enemy carefully'' and then you'd get techpoints in military.

If you win the crusade then you get an event where, you wouldn't be able to keep it and your own realm for your self, but you could choose it a new realm is set up with a new ruler or that you stay there and rule yourself.


So what do you guys think?

I apologize if this has been posted about before



EDIT: This idea would also apply to muslim Jihads.


EDIT 2: had some more ideas:


you'd get an event army

the pope gets an event vanguard force to lead the charge.

the Muslims get event troops to defend themselves from crusades.


EDIT 3: Another Idea

if you have unlanded sons and you don't join the crusade there would be a chance that they join it

Also feel free to post if you have your own ideas. :)",self,t5_2tgic,1376226847.0,,scandinavia,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1k3aoz/an_idea_regarding_crusades/

**The diary of King Turold d'Isigny**

**10 June

My father passed away today. 

Father, as you've demonstrated so often during your rule and many conquests. You have done well and lived up to the great name of D'Isigny. [I am proud to be your son] (http://i.imgur.com/sSTBNGjh.jpg). May you rest in peace, in the Lord's warm embrace. 

Goodbye

***

**11 June

I do wish father's death hadn't been so untimely. Suddenly everyone's looking at me for directions on what to do. All these councillors are bothering me with a million inane questions. ""Milord, the Basileus hates us."" Bah. I had no idea being a King was so time-consuming.

So I hid away with Richenda and we had a lovely 'stroll' in the garden
We're doing excellent - I mean

***

**12 June

Richenda and I stole away again, bright and amazing daughter. He demanded I take action. DEMANDED. Well, that does not do. I ordered him thrown in the dungeon for his insolence. He then proceeded to kill the guards, fled the castle and raised his men in rebellion! The nerve of that man!! TO ARMS!!

***

**13 June

My council is incompetent and they keep whining about the war and about Armand's false imprisonment. Well I've had it up to here with you all! I had them all replaced! 

Except for my lovely wife Richenda. She will remain my ever faithful Spymaster. And also except for Ildebrando

***

**9 July

Hah! It turns out Armand can't raise any troops. I will come and crush you later, enjoying the sun, with Aubrey sitting on my lap. She was telling me all sorts of stories. Little Eustache, my eldest son (4) tried to emulate his sister. They're both such bright children!

In the midst of the story a trembling messenger entered and I gave him my best annoyed look. He told me the Basilissa had perished. What wonderful news! I gave him 50 golden coins as a reward and he left

The second messenger that arrived I ordered beheaded. I didn't like this tunic. It was the most hideous shade of blue. I dislike that color. What did he want again? Oh yes, [named me a pretender] (http://i.imgur.com/sSTBNGjh.jpg) in favour  of some cousin. 

I'll get to that later. The sun is so nice and Aubrey and Eustache smell so sweetly of child and innocence.

***

**14 July

My new Marshal informed me that [Attilio declared war] (http://i.imgur.com/UCFtpzFh.jpg). Bah

***

**14 December

Well. [This is unfortunate] (http://i.imgur.com/8UpRbMMh.jpg). The Emperor of Francia declared war on me. My councilors weren’t very specific about why and I didn’t really care.  I suppose it is about our lands in France. I wonder if I should just give it to him. Managing a war is hard and a lot of work...

I suppose I'll have to take some action now... Maybe. Eustache came to show me how well he can fight with sticks. Hah! He shows the true D'Isigny spirit

***

**18 December

I've decided a war for our ancestral lands is [meaningless] (http://i.imgur.com/p3cdyS6h.jpg) and have ordered [the armies to return] (http://i.imgur.com/kLgPci7h.jpg) to destroy and crush the traitors that seek to destroy D'Isigny. Mark my words

***

**22 March

I've learned that [a cousin] (http://i.imgur.com/kP516EJh.jpg) is the instigator of these claimant wars. Him? He is dim-witted and ugly. Why do they prefer him over me?! Oh well. I had him killed. He died bloated and green like a toad! When I heard the news I laughed and laughed until I could laugh no more. 

[Then I was told that everyone else knew.] (http://i.imgur.com/ZtboLrVh.jpg) Oh well.

**11 May

It seems [another pretender] (http://i.imgur.com/6eiiUZgh.jpg) to the throne has stepped forward. Brother... Why do you betray our house for your selfish desires?

**17 May

Duke Humbert annoys me with his slothfulness. [Get some work done, so I ignored him and left to sit at the parapets and let the wind play with leaves and straw. I like dangling my feet over the parapets. It's soothing.

***

**August

News keeps reaching me of sieged and plundered cities by the French. Everyone in the castle seems to avoid me. Nobody is talking to me anymore. This annoyed me

***

**8 September

Little Eustache is old enough to be educated already. Such a bright lad

***

**8 November

My lovely wife gave birth to our fifth child

***

**18 November

Word reaches me that one of Armand's holdings has been destroyed. Good. As soon as my army is done crushing him

***

**26 February

The French enemy has been seen in the lands nearest to Saracusa. Yet Armand's holdings still persist! I will crush him first before I focus my attentions towards the invaders. Setting priorities for yourself is vital in things like this. My council has been nagging again

They shut up.

**27 February

I sent my sister [to marry Kaiser Ordulf] (http://i.imgur.com/EtMJWE8h.jpg) of the Holy Roman Empire today. Along with my sister

**21 June

Time to set sail homewards from [Armand's pathetic country] (http://i.imgur.com/hfed00Qh.jpg)and hope the 30.000 troops of Ordulf reach us soon. [Sicily doesn't look so good] (http://i.imgur.com/tvdUYHih.jpg).

**1 December

Our men are in the midst of a [vicious struggle for our survival] (http://i.imgur.com/tvdUYHih.jpg) in the neighbouring lands. They are our last defense. 

And then Richenda came in to give me some wonderful news. [She is with child once more] (http://i.imgur.com/GGDOdXkh.jpg)! Oh, us, D'Isigny so many beautiful and gifted children.

**3 January

Aubrey asked me why she couldn't have any strawberries anymore. I... I didn't know what to say. Our enemies have hold of all trade posts and trade routes. They have occupied our neighbours. We have enough food to last us a while

No

***

**15 January

This is unfortunate. Orwuld has amassed nearly 30.000 troops. Yet it seems [they have no ships to cross the sea] (http://i.imgur.com/bSMI86zh.jpg) to Sicily and come to our aid. I wonder if there was something I could have done to prevent this.

Father

**7 March

My [troops have launched a counter attack] (http://i.imgur.com/fLaay40h.jpg) at France. I fear it is too little

Well. Actually my troops will. And my marshal. I’m still at home

***

**8 March

Aubrey asked me about war. ""What is war

**10 March

Both Aubrey and Eustache have been giving out candy to some of the other children in the castle. They made sure to divide it up evenly. I see Richenda's hand in their education. Sometimes she can be troublesome

***

**2 July

An accursed day. The wretched Francian Emperor has STOLEN what is rightfully mine! He has crowned himself KING. [KING of SICILY] (http://i.imgur.com/wpcNYQeh.jpg)! How dare he!? This is far from over - One way or another, we will see what happens to you when I can summon my armies once more...

As I stewed with righteous wrath

It seems Richenda gave birth to our new child. A girl. Ah

Now, but after a quick and brutal fight I put him back in his place. A bribe later, and he was at least okay with me being alive, as opposed to hating my guts (I can't help it if I'm a genius!). I get through a year or two of peace and tranquility, when out of no where I get the popup, ""Hey, I get to go on a boat ride! It's going to be SUPER FANTASTIC AWESOME FUN TIMES!""

My reaction: ""NOOOO DON'T DOO EEET GET AWAY FROM THE BOOOOAAAT *clicks the only option

Me: ""Godamnnit so much.""

So of course the conniving bastard of an older character inherits

I told all of this to my fiance

Me: ""Dammnit

Him: ""... Are you trying to kill your children again?""

Me: ""... Noooo, then his brother, a genius, will inherit, and I'll have an easier time in the future. And since his father/my nephew was an idiot and made me spymaster, it should happen pretty quickly I just need a few more conspirators.""

Anyway, conquer the Baltic, fuck the Vikings, conquer the Salians. A very convoluted order of events, to be sure, but it makes sense when you're doing it.

So I started the game by marrying Adelheid Salian for the HRE alliance. Heinrich IV (for whatever reason) absolutely loved me, Pommerania, Prussia, Lithuania and Estonia. Huzza!

By this point my good old King Boleslaw was about 70, the Crusader trait, a ton of prestige, Low CA, Max Feudal Levies, etc. With so much land under his belt--even if much of it was only recently conquered--he had over 17,000 men at his disposal.

Well, and this is where I become an inglorious bastard: I requested an invasion, conquered the HRE and imprisoned Heinrich V. I know, I know, bad form, and from a dynasty that had been so good to me, I know! But the story's not done yet.

Boleslaw now-the-first and Boleslaw II die with Heinrich V still in prison. When good 'ol Heinrich finally dies his son Heinrich would-have-been-sixth takes over under the reign of Boleslaw III. The Pope calls a crusade on Jerusalem, betrayed allies the Salians; he gives the Kingdom of Jerusalem to Heinrich would-have-been-sixth-but-is-now-first, King of Jerusalem.

From here, and was at the forefront of Imperial defense when the German Dukes got uppity. Even though they eventually followed the example of the Imperial Piasts and went Polish, they retained the friendship they had held during their time as Germans, and as many Salians were landed throughout the Empire as Piasts (specifically Jerusalem, Egypt, Aragon and Italy were all Salian titles, and they really did never rebel against me).
