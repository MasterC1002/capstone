I love this subreddit

What I've noticed a bit of lately is a stuck up attitude to a 'critique'. The idea of this community is to give each other feedback so we can all improve as designers

If you submit a design, peoples opinions on a nice design are different, but there are foundations such as use of the golden ratio, typographic hierarchy, page layout, colours and so on that all designers agree on. If you're design is missing some of these elements then your design will be **criticised**. Personally, I try to criticise all the bad points AND point out all the good points so people not just know what's wrong

There've been several instances as the community has grown whereby people submit their work and react badly to feedback by arguing that their design is perfect or simply throwing toys out of the pram and deleting the post. This is not what this community is for

I enjoy reading this subreddit. For me it's an opportunity to give back a bit to the community

However in here, or fresh out of school and are looking to improve. They get feedback that is abstract, unhelpful, and at times, misguided... and then they try to apply it to their work. They grow disillusioned on their struggle to follow advice like ""don't use gradients"" not knowing why they have to avoid them. ""Don't use dropshadows""... so I can never use them? Stuff like that.

Nobody has told me of this frustration though. What I have been told more than once are comments and appreciation from individuals on the critiques I have provided. How I have helped them really understand how they can improve as a designer

At the same time

I'm not exactly sure if this is an issue. I feel it is, but it's definitely some options I've thought about.

1368124063.0,1e0lfq,[Website] Be brutal! We're a tech startup with a UI from an agency,rsiddle,25,2,42,"Hi all

I started building a flat share listing company called Room Central ([roomcentral.co.uk](http://roomcentral.co.uk)) back in early 2012 and only just launched it in April 2013. Since I started the build, 200creative to help out. Since we've started I've been quite happy with the design, I think it looks quite playful and easy on the eye.

Because it's my own child I've instantly got a bias to thinking its great

We've effectively got three markets:
1. Professionals who are looking for flat shares in a city
2. Students who are looking for flat sharing in a city
3. Landlords who want to list their rooms for rent

It would be really helpful if I could have some feedback from each perspective where possible, is there anything missing that you would expect to be there, how quickly does it load.

Something that I'm also really keen to have feedback on is the map user interaction. Does it do what you expect and provide the information that you need?

The theme has been built from the Twitter Bootstrap so hopefully that have given some good support in the longer run.

Looking to hear all thoughts/comments/suggestions.

I have worked with many different styles and I finally created something that I'm happy with but im scared that I might have gotten tunnel vision through this project and might have missed out on something for this idea. A small background on the studio. We specialize in creating and design labels for private and national food brands. The studio is currently going through a rebranding and wanted to create a modern look since we are considering expanding into designing in other fields since we do specialize in different things. when this logo was created a few things where considered

1. I wanted the idea of the finger square to be there since that was emphasized by the director.
2. Since food is still what we mainly work in I edited this so that it would have a flow and almost have a feel as if it is ""wrapping around"" the center without being too direct about it
3. Logo/branding work is something we are considering starting to look working into. so I wanted to have a simple minimal look with this

Hi! I've been working on this IRC client with a friend for a while and I'd really appreciate some feedback on the design. The above picture is a mockup made with Adobe Fireworks but implementation is well on its way. I'm a developer

If you're not familiar with IRC, with higher ranks being able to kick/ban/etc. Users can directly message each other (called querying or private messaging) in addition to joining/creating channels.

Some notes on the design:

* The darker icons to the left of the channels/queries indicate unread messages
* The red number to the right of them indicate ""mentions""/""highlights""; this is when someone mentions your username. It's a very common feature for IRC clients to beep and notify you when you're mentioned so that you don't miss someone directly addressing you when connected to a lot of busy channels.
* In the actual chat window, except they display on whichever channel/query you currently have open instead of in a separate query window. CTCP (client-to-client protocol) requests ask the receiving client for some info (e.g. CTCP TIME has the client respond with local time, CTCP VERSION with the receiver's OS/processor/client name and version).

Thanks!

I'm a senior graduating this year. I'm not looking for any freelance jobs. My portfolio is just what I'm submitting in my job applications. I'm applying to both design firms and startups. The person whose looking at this site and making the hiring decisions will probably be a designer (I wouldn't go to a startup if there is not a designer on staff already) or a HR person with design knowledge. Most the firms will be small. I do not want to go into big advertising or marketing firms.

[The latest progression](http://i.imgur.com/IIKi8Fl.jpg)

Let me explain:

#1 is what my business card design looked like with what I thought was my final logo last week. I made it while being well aware of the fact that I was violating a lot of logo no-no's, it's for design, so it I'll be in control of how it's used and will adjust accordingly."" The core of the logo is my name, the buoy, and ""designer &amp; illustrator,"" while the water was just a secondary element that I would use in any instance I could. I also was using the dashed lines and anchor as part of my system for my resume and website. As I was laying out the site, I realized the water doesn't work well, and the logo itself is boring without the water.

My site design has gone to a white and grey color palette

So after doing more reworking

I've gone back to the tried and true black and white logo (sort of, but it's not really adding to the logo.

By #5,"" so I moved it and scaled it a bit for #5. #6 felt like the buoy was too grounded while it was sitting on the baseline, so I moved it up to make it appear more like it's floating for #7.

That's my long shpeal. I could use any feedback right about now

**Target Audience:** non-profits and small- to mid-size businesses who are ready to take the next step in organizing and streamlining workflow
  
**The Mark:** based off of gantt charts
  
**Colors = Main Concern:** client's unsure about the colors. I'm pretty sure about them- but the clients and myself are all avid redditors and we were hoping you guys might be able to critique these colors. The idea behind them is that primary colors are building blocks- so the blocks (golden rectangles) in the abstract gantt chart mark are simple shapes/primary colors and set in logical increments, to refine them a bit (since primary colors are kind of loud and often seem cheap).  
  
**Looking Ahead / Further Branding:** the idea here is that these muted primary colors will be used throughout the branding material as accents rather than large expanses of color. We want to keep materials focused on what is necessary, not only because this company is giving clients materials and processes that they just need to use to make their processes more efficient (and not be dazzled by branding- this is not a business of luxury, entertainment / delight), but also because it works well in keeping with the idea of ""trimming the fat"" and just getting right down to business.

I am designing menus for my small mom &amp; pop BBQ restaurant.  This is the cover page.  We currently just have spreadsheets of our menus made up

I am using GIMP for photo manipulation (have taught myself what little I know about it over the past month or so) and PrintShop 2.0 for the actual layout manipulation.  The more I learn about GIMP

Note that the wooden pig is actually a 5' tall chainsaw carved pig that sits in our restaurant.  :-)

Things I don't like:

* The word ""menu"" and it's wooden background
* The campfire background of the page (I've struggled and struggled with finding the right background
* The border - maybe.  Is it too thick?  Does it need a border at all?
* All of the empty space in the bottom quadrants of the page
* The whole d#%* thing.  :-)


Things I *do* like:

* Our logo - probably because I didn't design it.
* The pig - he's sort of an icon/mascot.  His sizing or location are fair game for changes

Like most of you, people, and dishes that one day I hopefully will be able to experience for myself. To foster this idea, Housefed lets you find other foodies in your hometown and share a home-cooked meal with them. When you are traveling, then you'll be able to tap into the Housefed community to meet a local cook and book a meal in their kitchen. It is letting people share their food with people who wouldn't normally be able to try it.

So far a lot of people have signed up in anticipation of the meal-booking aspect which I fully opened this week. There are hosts in the US and UK that you can see their dishes

-The use of the logo is weird because this is one of the 4 restaurants on the resort

- Mainly this will be on the menu (maybe) and a big wooden sign.

-The client wanted an oval around the logo and grill marks. I avoided using grill marks because it really kills the ""quality"" look of the logo. MIGHT ad a washed out look if the client insist.

I feel like the oval makes it look too much like a room number or address.

I'm also worried about the little swirls not translating well to print (im a pre-press guy by profession)

Update;


Second set:
1. obligatory what client wants.

2.I think getting rid of a border all together really helps this logo

3. If they really want a border choose something other than a oval so it doesn't look so much like a hotel room number.

What the client wanted originally was grill marks through it



I was going to add custom flourish inside the borders to fill the dead space

I have 2 main questions.
  
My first question isn't design related but is on a potential copyright issue. My grandfather was a huge Packard fan and he was who inspired us to do this so we chose to use the ""Doughnut Chaser"" hood ornament (famous on Packards) as part of our logo. Is there some place we can find out if this is a copyrighted image? The Packard company was bought out by Studebaker in the early 50's and then Studebaker went defunct itself in 1967.

Hi all.
A while back I posted on here and /r/design looking for critiques on web design after my previous designer had been incredibly unreliable. Just wanted to give you all an update now the site is live!

I took a lot of your feedback on board

http://www.controltheriot.co.uk/

1. The hierarchy of content has changed as per feedback. Date now takes a less prominent role.
2. All fonts have been updated to use Google Web Fonts.
3. The search bar was improved as per feedback.
4. The icons on the slider have been moved and resized to be more apparent.
5. Copy has been added to the feature image to make it more immediately obvious that it links to an article.

Just thought people might appreciate an update and like to see that their advice was taken on board! Really appreciate everyone's help

**A few things to keep in mind:**

-I coded this website myself after a few courses in HTML, but while my skills may be limited, I still feel it's important for me to code this myself in order to showcase that skill I possess. I view using a platform like Squarespace as being a cop-out for me personally.

-I want to convey that I'm approachable/friendly and professional

-The work is diverse because our list of possible co-op choices is also diverse

-I have some newer work I still need to add, and environmental design (co-op).

-Although freelance clients are directed here

The bare concept is that of transferring sound into textile design using both literal and lateral methods. 
I ended up using vibrations to transfer the sound for the splat design by bouncing paint off speakers and catching it on silk. I then Photoshopped it into a commercialised design which was then printed onto cotton poplin.
I recorded everyday sounds such as the toilet flushing
The other design is on pure silk and is a mix of screen printed sound-waves and laser cutting. It is predominantly pouring water as the sound-wave source
