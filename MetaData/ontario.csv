I am an Ontario teacher and I have a heart. You have asked teachers to go back to volunteering their time for extra-curriculars. Thank you for the lesson in hypocrisy. I will return to volunteering my time when you and your members of parliament return the money that you have earned since October

Your abuse of power is limitless. Your decision to prorogue the legislature was strictly to protect yourself and your minority government’s power from being taken away by the Conservatives and the NDP. 
 
While the legislature has been closed since October, they have not been participating in extra-curriculars. 

You are right, there are thousands of dedicated teachers across this province that also want to provide enriching and diverse clubs and sports teams for their students. Instead, we are forced to refrain from doing the things we have done so willingly and whole-heartedly for years because our profession is being so greatly threatened. 

Our basic right to a fair collective agreement has been denied. We are not pulling back on extra-curricular activities because we don’t have hearts. We are pulling back because we want to protect the integrity of the Canadian Labour Code; so that our students can enter a fair and just workforce when it is their time. 

This is not about banking sick days for me, fighting to defend the integrity of my profession. 

As a beginning teacher

I came to Ontario after working in Alberta and Quebec because of the stellar reputation of the Ontario education system. In my 3 years of working here as a teacher, engaging, student-centered learning environment. I will continue working in this profession that I so love. I will continue doing this because it is what is in my heart.

I plan to build a house on that parcel but so far I've had a lot of problems locating any zoning information for that region of the province. The township websites are pretty poor and basically have very little information. 

Some questions for anyone who lives in the North of the province year-round:

How are the internet speeds up there? Telecom infrastructure seems to be pretty poor from what I have found out so far. Internet is crucial for me as I am a redditor and a day trader. 

What do you dislike about living in the north? 

Are you armed? - I think buying some firearms will be a priority for me given the remoteness of the region. 

What is the culture like? Is everyone looking out for one another out there? 

How bureaucratic are the local governments? Will it be difficult to acquire a building permit? Is investment in the region encouraged by building on land

He told us it was a mistake and the advertisement we responded to said that we had to pay for hydro but gave us a lease for the wrong unit saying we didn't have to. Apparently the lease we signed was for unit ""D"" and our unit is unit ""H"". We really don't have the money to pay for hydro and this changes everything..

Basically, and because it was at a time when my finances were already going down the tube, I couldn't get it back. It expired, and so now I have no driver's license.

I have no passport

I have no credit cards, and until my credit clears up, no company will even consider giving me a card.


So now, so now I have to start from the beginning). So I got there, and they tell me I need to pay a license reinstatement fee first, which I did, at 150$. All of these locations were willing to use my expired health card as proof of ID.

But then finally when I got to the drive test centre again

Nope. Can't renew my health card because I don't have the necessary proof of ID. I even inquired about the new Ontario Photo Card specifically made for people without a driver's license and such. One of the requirements of an Ontario Photo Card? Photo ID!

 Aggregate mining is a serious for many in Ontario, puts even more dangerous trucks on the road - I've already witnessed one of the two fatal accidents involving a gravel truck and car within a 1km stretch on this road - and more noise. In addition to the shitty environment that follows these pits, we will also be faced with a 30% property value loss. The farm land that they'd be digging up, some of the best farm land in Canada, would be irreparably damaged. Even though they say they 'rehabilitate' the land, it will never again be as productive when it comes to agriculture making these endeavors extremely short-sighted economically.

There are two very different paths forward for our province.
&gt; 
&gt;Down one path lies bigger government
&gt;
That’s the path the Liberals have taken us down for the past nine years – and they’ve failed to take the action necessary to get us back on track.
&gt; 
Down another path, and lower taxes.
&gt;
That’s the path Tim Hudak and the Ontario PC Party want to take our province down.
&gt;
We are the only Party that will proudly stand up for fiscal sanity and job creation. To chart a course toward more jobs and away from overspending
&gt;
On Monday, without reforming the delivery of health care – the single largest provincial program expenditure. This means putting patients at the centre of decisions, not bureaucrats.
&gt;
Also coming soon is the final report of the PC Job Creation Task Force – with a focus on removing government barriers to job creation
&gt;
Sincerely
&gt;
The Ontario PC Party

Edit:

Just got this from the Liberals (ya

&gt; ‪
Ontario Liberals are hard at work in the Legislature fighting for progress in the priorities that matter most to Ontario families. Here is what you need to know:
&gt;
• Tomorrow in the Legislature
&gt;
• We also need the opposition to step up for a third-reading vote on our Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit
&gt;
• And after nine months
&gt;
• We are determined to deliver on our strong plan for Ontario. Families both expect and deserve that kind of focus — and to make that happen

&gt;
Instead of focusing on these important priorities, when they fired 6,000 nurses and produced the worst surgical wait times in Canada.
&gt;
The Hudak PCs would cut recklessly and put universal public health care at risk
&gt;
Only Ontario Liberals have a plan to balance the budget and protect universal public health care and education while growing the economy and creating jobs for families. We're going to keep our focus where it has always been — moving forward
&gt;
What You Can Do
&gt;
Tweet about making the minority Legislature work:
&gt;
#OLP working on priorities of Ontario families – opposition need to join with us to make minority legislature work #onpoli
&gt;
Hudak PCs back to old ideas – they'd fire nurses who provide care for families &amp; seniors across Ontario #onpoli #PCPO
&gt;
#ONDP need to start working constructively and help pass help pass renovation tax credit to help parents live independently at home #onpoli

Economics and Taxation have always been very interesting to me. I've often wondered how certain taxes where instituted, or lectures from older generations, it was clear that the people with the most money were able to avoid paying, or lobby to have their taxes reduced. I wanted to know how.

When I was around 17, but I did astound several accountants when I showed them my findings.

Anyways, and raised the top income tax rate (above $72,000) from 11% to 15%, we could remove provincial income tax for anyone under $72,000 and we would be roughly revenue neutral. 

For people making under $30,000 would receive $1000 income supplement.

What do you say?

The proposed mega-quarry would threaten the headwaters of the Nottawasaga, Grand and Saugeen watershed systems and the Mad, Noisy, consequently, including various freshwater fish species.

(any way to get more info on concert pianists in Canada in the 1930's-ish timeframe?).  

The birth mother's father left the family shortly after her birth and moved to a ""northern central US state"" and operated a wood  business.  The birth mother's mother worked as a crane operator ""during the war"" (did not specify which war).  The birth mother had twin brothers who later married and had children in Canada.

(is it odd that the she worked as a crane operator? Any guesses where this might have been?)

-Facts about birth mother meeting her husband: Sometime in the late 50's to 1960

(any ideas what ""heavy equipment operator"" is code for?)

They married and lived on the Michigan base, born in 1960-61 timeframe. In either 1962 or 1963 they moved to Tyndall AFB in Florida, where by bf was born in 1964 and given up for adoption.

Now that work hasn't picked up at all the company says they'll either terminate my employment or I can accept a wage and job description modification that will see me put from a very generous salary to an hourly rate that would see me making barely enough to live on due to the extreme shortage of hours that would be made available to me.

So my question is, like a salary worker should be, and in my opinion the company has agreed they were 'working days' simply by paying me for them....so do they owe me my thirty day bonus?

For now I've selected a Creative Commons image that I think most Ontarians are familiar with in the month of March.  I want to ask what everyone thinks of the idea of having a contest for a month header image. For each month we could have community submissions of images and the one with the most upvotes would be used as the header for the remained of that month. My idea is that the images would show or represent something about that month. I think it will give us something interesting to look at each month and an opportunity to showcase some of the artistic talent of our community and the culture of our province. If there is enough interest in this idea

On a more technical note, I've it working now!**

Today was my first day of work, I'm not at all impressed by how our meeting went. 

There is an incentive bonus for people who secure full-time jobs, because it would mean I would get over a thousand dollars this month in total. 

This is a complete non sequitur, so you SHOULDN'T get more"". How can you NOT end up getting more than a thousand on a month when you have won a full-time job? 

There's no way that they have this kind of discretionary power, to be honest, though I have no idea why someone who I met for the first time should dislike me. 

She underlined the fact that she has no rule or reg to justify herself with by saying that she would discuss it with another worker and have a decision by tomorrow. If she was just following the rules

Gee

To add insult to injury

I asked her to email me instead

I'm supposed to stand there and just keep trying because she doesn't want to bother writing an email that could be a single sentence long? I can't be the only client who compensated for the ridiculously low budgets for rent and food by dropping any expense they could

This person is completely unfit to be working with clients, but is there anything else that I should know about my rights here? Can they simply refuse my bonus on a whim like this?

From my Google-ing it seems that for me to be able to legally officiate a wedding in the province of Ontario (where the wedding is most likely going to take place) I will need to become a judge, or become an ordained minister of a Church/religious group which the government has deemed legitimate (thus getting ordained online will not work).

It wouldn't cost a whole lot, GO transit is pretty cheap, and you could just bring your own food. It would give us all a nice chance to leave our dark rooms to see the outside world, and maybe meet some cool people. Who knows!? Anyways, I really want to do this.

* For liquor

* Beer is sold at a separate (and privately owned) store by the name of the Beer Store.  This is the ONLY private retailer licensed to sell beer ('though you can get six packs and stuff from the aforementioned LCBO).  Because of this monopoly

My major issue with this system is that we now lack consumer voting power when it comes to what types of beverages we can buy.  If liquor were to be sold at more locations, the consumer can't buy it.

A group of my friends and I from Detroit are looking to do some camping in Ontario for Memorial Day weekend (May 25-28). It's been pretty hard to find places on the internet

Here's what we're looking for:

1) Not too far from Detroit. We're looking at maybe 5-6 hours driving time. I've been using an imaginary line from Toronto to Tobermory for the edge of my search

2) Close proximity to something outdoorsy to do. Canoeing is our main go-to but we're open to other ideas as well. I tried to convince my friends to hike part of the Bruce Trail but no one seemed interested in that idea. We've done whitewater and canoeing in the past. Drunk activities are even better.

3) Somewhere where drinking isn't necessarily frowned upon. We're pushing close to 30 for most of us so we're not going to get too crazy

4) Dogs being allowed would be a plus but isn't absolutely necessary.

1317790116.0,l1dvw,A Protest Ballot during the Ontario Provincial Election,DROID_POSTAL_CODE,12,4,27,"This is my first time posting here; hope my formatting is accurate.


Last Friday

The voting process is simple: an elector signs into the poll, hands the ballot to the Tabulator Deputy Returning Officer (TDRO), who puts it into the vote tabulating machine [Dominion Voting](http://www.dominionvoting.com/) .  On that day, it all appeared to run smoothly, until I casted my ballot which was undervoted (blank).  The machine alerted the TDRO to this fact, who explained to me that he had to ask (by the book) if that were the way I truly intended to vote, or if it were a mistake.  

Having burnt a few ballots at previous elections

As described by Section 42 (Voter Privacy) of the Elections Act

**Interference with electors**

(3)  No person shall attempt to obtain at a polling place information as to the candidate for whom an elector is about to vote or interfere or attempt to interfere with an elector in a polling place. R.S.O. 1990

**Elector not to display ballot**

(4)  Subject to sections 14 and 55, s. 42 (4).

**Inducing elector to display ballot**

(5)  No person shall, c. E.6, s. 42 (5).

**Communicating information as to how elector is voting**

(6)  No person shall communicate any information obtained at a polling place as to the candidate for whom an elector is about to vote or has voted or whether the elector declined to vote. R.S.O. 1990

**No person compellable to disclose vote**

(7)  In any legal proceedings no person may be compelled to state for whom he or she voted or whether he or she marked his or her ballot or not. R.S.O. 1990

Full copy of the Election Act:
[Election Act](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e06_e.htm#BK99)

Compare this to the directive issued by the Chief Electoral Officer Greg Essensa found here:  

[Directive from the CEO](http://www.elections.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/2E497994-1D02-45BB-BFB4-477292804BF9/5249/TabulatorDirectiveCEOApproved.pdf)

The section of concern is: 

**Rejected, or Ambiguously Marked Ballots** 

12. (1) When a ballot marked as described in rules 10 and 11 has been returned by the vote tabulator because it is a rejected ballot, or an ambiguously marked ballot: 

1. The tabulator deputy returning officer shall advise the waiting elector and ask the elector if he or she wishes to return that ballot and receive another ballot. 

2. If the elector wishes to receive another ballot
i. the original ballot shall be returned to the deputy returning officer or special ballot officer
ii. the deputy returning officer or special ballot officer shall mark the original ballot ""cancelled"", and, 
iii. the deputy returning officer or special ballot officer shall instruct the elector to mark another ballot in accordance with the instructions. 

3. If the elector’s ballot was a rejected ballot or an unmarked ballot and the elector does not wish to receive another ballot

4. If the elector’s ballot was a misread ballot or an ambiguously marked ballot and the elector does not wish to receive another ballot

(2) When a ballot marked as described in rules 10 and 11 is returned by the vote tabulator and the elector has left the polling place

Has anybody else encountered this problem as well?  

Would you like to?

I understand that the Vote Tabulator is also being used for Special Ballots [Special Ballot](http://wemakevotingeasy.ca/en/special-ballots.aspx) [Location of Special Ballot Offices](http://fyed.elections.on.ca/fyed/en/form_page_en.jsp) , cite section 42 (3,4,5,6) of the Election Act, and either decline your vote under protest, or do anything else you can think of.  Just remember to be polite to the poll workers; they only follow the manual given to them.


Directive: http://www.elections.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/2E497994-1D02-45BB-BFB4-477292804BF9/5249/TabulatorDirectiveCEOApproved.pdf

Election Act: http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e06_e.htm#BK99

**Addendum**

I'll admit that it's pretty much the most uninspired democratic call to arms in history. No bugle, so I thought I would put this out there. I think it also needs a TL;DR.

**TL;DR**

**Go troll Elections Ontario tomorrow by casting a blank vote through the tabulating machine

The machine reads the ballot, ambiguous or invalid. The TDRO is then required to ask the elector if that is how they actually chose to vote, and if not, to correct it. The machine will store an over/undervoted ballot once they are manually cast by the TDRO, and will print these onto the display tape. I understand that I was the only person to vote this way at my poll.

By blank ballot I mean not putting a mark inside the Candidate's circle.

The machine makes a distinction between candidates

-Removing all penalties for animal abuse violations.

-Stripping the OSPCA of all enforcement powers and abolishing the Animal Care Review Board (which currently hears appeals from people whose animals have been removed by the OSPCA).

-Stopping the OSPCA from removing animals from abusive situations.

-Taking away the OSPCA's authority to order owners to take proper steps to care for their pets (e.g. ordering an owner to provide water

-Removing the legal obligation of veterinarians to report animal abuse.

-The only recourse animals would have would be the Criminal Code of Canada, dangerous or aggressive animals and whether the police service has enough resources to take on this extra role.

-The OSPCA would be forced to keep animals in their care when their owners are charged with animal abuse. Even if these owners are subsequently convicted

-The OSPCA would not have the option of putting livestock up for adoption - the law would force them to sell horses, pigs etc. at public auctions only.

Which would leave us 5 days to get back to Toronto. I figure we'd spend a couple more days around Nova Scotia then head back to Toronto in bigger jumps via Montreal.

The route out East splits the drive up so that we have enough time to look around once we arrive at places and visits places that look interesting - but I'm happy to make changes. The biggest jump is from Quebec to Fredericton which is about 370 miles.

We are happy to see anything and everything

I have a few specific questions;

1)We are considering driving to Ottawa via the Algonquin national park. This would bump the driving up to 6 ½ hours. Is it worth it? Enough to spend a night nearby?

2)Is my plan for driving out East sound? Is there an alternative route I should consider?

3)If you were going to drive back from Nova Scotia to Toronto would you do it over 5 days or less and what stops would you make?

4)We are planning to use Air bnb for accommodation but any suggestions for places to stay (no camping)

Hi Ontarians

My interviewer and potential boss told me that they used to have a place for summer students close to work but that the government is no longer operating that and I'd have to find somewhere to rent. After a quick search a months rent would be anywhere from $500 to $600. 

I'd like to know how much you folks spend on food and gas in a week or a month if you have that information. I was considering biking to work all summer and was told that they had one student do that but that it was pretty dangerous since you take a highway to get to work. It's about 20 km one way

TLDR; broke ass student would like to know how much people are spending to comfortably (frugally) eat

Oh and enchant me with tales of fishing

Thanks!

Edit: I also heard horror stories about the flies... Are these true?
       Also the reason this job is so appealing for me is because it's a technical job and I'll be able to learn sweet skills that are applicable to my study. That and I only get to accept/decline the summer jobs I'm offered though the program.

Can this particular convention be legally circumvented? It would be a shame to win a large sum of money and subsequently lose one's anonymity.

Why I'm asking...
My bosses friend called the office in a panic as his wife informed him of the crisis going on at the hospital she works at.
Apparently someone tainted coke/weed/etc with some kind of a wormer medication. This wormer medication is somehow causing bacteria to infest parts of the drug users body forcing hospitals to amputate the infected areas as its the only way to save these people.
They also said that there are 49 cases so far

I got charged with careless driving.  The cop said if i fight it they generally go easy on you because ""expecting to pay this ticket is ridiculous""

Seriously.

What I propose is a deposit return system for ALL packaged goods.

Go to McDonalds -- Fry cup 10¢ - Big Mac box 10¢ - Medium drink cup 10¢ - Bag 5¢ 

It'd be an extra 35¢ on top of the price of a meal.  


Buy a new TV -- $7 worth of cardboard styrafoam and plastic.


Most people would probably throw it in the garbage because they're not dicks.  

Some people would collect it for the $$.

The way I'd explain it to anyone other than Reddit is - ""church groups and boyscout troops could clean our highways as a fundraiser!""  --  But that really means ""meth addicts will clean our cities and highways for free!""


Imagine a world where a Timmies cup is worth a dime.  Our streets would be spotless.


The best part is:  Most people would still just throw out their garbage

Since then we've had trouble finding her a doctor. We've tried calling a handful but no luck. I tried calling my doctor since childhood (since we still live near by) thinking he would accept family members regardless but the receptionist told me the doctor would not be accepting new patients - family or otherwise.

I feel like this calling around is grossly inefficient and getting us nowhere. We just learned in the last week that we are pregnant so finding her a doctor is a little more urgent now.

Does anyone have suggestions for how to find her a family doctor? Is there a generic list we can sign up for or a one-stop-shop phone number we can call? We live in the London area if that helps.


**EDIT:*** Thank you everyone for your great suggestions. We eventually found a local doctor for her who was willing to make an exception given the urgency.

Here is an email forward I received from my very conservative cousin.  Obviously

I'd like to send him back a list of GOOD things accomplished by the incumbent government.  Can you also help compile a list like that?

The email forward:

&gt;Whoever put this together DID THEIR HOMEWORK. Gets you thinking.

&gt;Don't forget, by leaps and bounds. 
 
&gt;PLEASE READ

&gt;Here is what our Premier has done for Ontario in the past seven years. Remember...he had a no tax increase election message/campaign.

&gt;He has increased all the licensing fees from your car to your boat including fishing and hunting.

&gt;He introduced the health care premium (not called a tax) and some couples pay as much as $1

&gt;He has put an ECO tax on many containers such as paint cans and window washer fluid.  And people still don't realize it until they see the bill - he kept that one real quiet.

&gt;He put a disposal tax on all electronics.

&gt;He put the disposal tax back on tires.

&gt;And now he has passed the HST tax - the largest tax on the province ever and the only other tax in Ontario that ever came close to this in the past was the health care premium. He passed this bill even though 76% of the people in Ontario were against it.
This HST will provide the Province with an additional THREE BILLION dollars a year.

&gt;Then on July 15th

&gt;Let us not forget the E-health scandal with 1.2 billion dollars wasted and paid out to friends and relatives. What was Mr. McGuinty's answer to this? ?Well, after he fired the CEO and then gave her a severance package of $300,000 - not bad for only being on the job for seven months.

&gt;And what about the SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR windmill power plant contract that he awarded to KOREA ? One would think there was some place in Canada or North America that could have built these.

&gt;He also closed the emergency rooms in Port Colbourne and Fort Erie because there was not enough money. There have been two deaths since then because by the time they got to St. Catharine's it was too late. But he then awards a hospital in Toronto three million dollars - of course

&gt;He has taken the richest most prosperous province in Canada down to one of the 'Have-Nots' and,000.00 a year - millions of people in the province don't earn even half of that.

&gt;Have we forgotten all the MP'S who also got a 14% increase? And now that they've had their increases he comes out with a new budget to freeze all provincial employees wages for two years - a bit late don't you think.

&gt;He increased the hydro tax by 10% in April of 2010.
He took the freeze off tuition for students in Ontario

&gt;He has increased the tax on liquor and wine by 10% in May of 2010.

&gt;Also, Ontario suddenly had an energy surplus and no longer needed the plant.
Now he's going to give newcomers a break getting a job by offering potential employers $10

&gt;Dalton is a dolt and a fake and needs to go down heaped with shame for a job very badly done. 

&gt;But

&gt;Wake up Ontario!! 
 
&gt;And pensioners have not received a raise in over 18 months!!!!!
