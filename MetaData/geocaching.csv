We came up to ground zero, all leading to essentially a well that the culvert led into, and another tunnel that led underground. Having some decent rains recently, the water level looked painfully high. A quick dip of a branch to find where the bottom was proved to put solid ground at roughly belly-button deep. ""Nothing more to it, but to do it,"" I said to myself, and started climbing down.

A few rungs down, and I lower myself into water that was far too cold to reasonably be sitting in.

A small eternity (which evidently turned out to be about three whole minutes of regular, a member of the Sheriff's Department comes sauntering down the trail, with a prison work detail in tow. I sit tight, and my wife and buddy sit on the edge of the well, trying to look innocent.

The cop stops, quite nonchalantly. The jig is up, and we are officially discovered. I climb up a bit, and wave a hand out of the top of the well. The cop laughs, as his brother, an avid cacher, had told him horror stories of this cache. The work crew, freaked out a bit

The group crowded about to see what we were doing, peering down. They even went on to offer tools to help me search where my hands would not reach.

Eventually, and eventually made the find. Changed clothes, and made a dozen more finds. Hell of a day.

I went on a night cache with a group of four friends.  We all had headlamps

It wasn't a difficult trail to follow, we discovered it was a reflector on someone's shoes!  They were almost hidden by the bushes, but the reflector caught off our headlamps.

When it was announced that someone was under the bush, alive, and wanted to be left alone).  Since we had obviously disturbed them, we called out an apology.  After about 30 seconds of silence, we turned back.  The night cache was in a large public park (used mostly for Frisbee golf by day) in what we had considered to be a fairly safe suburban neighborhood, but finding creeps hiding in the bushes made the game MUCH less fun.

Walking back to our car, alone, dressed in all black, and with no flashlight light met us on the path walking the opposite direction.

Being a semi-nice person, that she had friends behind her on the trail and to ""not let them scare you.""

Then she apparently jumped back into the brush

Wanting nothing more than to avoid encountering her further, and called someone for a ride to the car.  We spotted what we assumed was her car hidden outside of the designated parking area on the way back to get ours.

I was geocaching with a few friends yesterday.  We had done a few caches in local parks and still had about an hour of daylight and so decided to stop at one last quick grab which appeared to be just off of a side road.

Brief description of area: The side road connects some large student housing complexes to a sports bar and is perhaps about a third of a mile long.  Lots of cars park along this road for the sports bar; mine was a little distant from the others.  The cache appeared to be on the outskirts of a drainage basin - the type you often see near dense commercial and housing developments.

Anyway

""Hello
""Oh
""Mine
Officer: ""Can we see your ID
Me: ""Sure, not speaking, body language not friendly.
As I gave the officer my ID, and then the two officers retreated to the car to run our IDs!?!?!??!?!

So now we have to stand around by the car, in my opinion.

The first officer stepped out and returned our IDs to us and asked if we were going to be doing any more caching.  ""No

If you're planning on doing any caching at night or in areas with a lot of ""muggles"" please PRINT OUT GEOCACHING BROCHURES.  There is a print friendly brochure on the website and it has saved me more than once:

http://www.geocaching.com/tools/default.aspx#Guide

Geocaching is a fairly unknown community (at least where I am from) and when you try to explain to a cop or even people passing by that you're looking for small, you can see how it may be taken.  Even when I present them with my gps, they aren't convinced I'm up to any good, but that official looking brochure always seems to put them at ease.  Before I had the brochures with me, I spent a half hour trying to persuade some officers that I am simply playing a game, only to be released and told not to come back again... but when I have that brochure with me, they become much friendlier and even interested.  One officer even joined me to look for an easy 1/1

i think that its awesome that she does this, but i just keep it to myself. it kind of irritates me since i know there are so many kids that go out with their families, and those kids are probably just like my cousin who get so much joy out of leaving something for a stranger to find. i cant hate on that. 

question is, but the 'trade even, trade up, or dont trade' thing is kinda blah for regular caches that are kid friendly and available to anyone. am i the only one that gets a little peeved by this? 

sorry if this has been discussed before. maybe i just have a case of cabin fever and im overthinking lol...but i just think there are some adults in this game that need to take lessons from the kids that are playing too. :/

The two men looked at each other and the guy with the cell phone (who turned out to be the owner of the company) told me he had called a squad car.

After talking another minute with the police he hung up and told me he was going to let it go. I apologized for the misunderstanding and wished them a good evening before heading to my car. Whew!

Many of you are probably aware of the new Garmin developed site: [Opencaching.com](http://www.opencaching.com). In many ways this site is superior to geocaching.com both from a cacher's perspective and from a software developer's perspective. IMHO the site is easier to navigate

As a software developer

On the other hand, Android, iPhone, or other applications to interact with the site data and create a new/better/alternative user experience. To me, this much better represents the kind of philosophy the geocaching community shares.

Opencaching's greatest weakness is the utter lack of caches. Here in southern Vermont I've got about three within a 30 mile radius. What would really help is if everytime one of us places a new cache on geocaching.com

A few years back, take a picture of it there, send the picture to a certain website (and say where it was taken), and then leave the statue for another random person to do the same. The goal seemed to be how far they could get this little guy to go. Which I thought was awesome.

So awesome, that I decided to take the goose to Scotland with me. (By this time I had looked them up online, saw they also had a cat statue and some other stuff. I think their starting point was somewhere Midwest, but I wish I could remember more details).

However, mostly), and it's been bothering me for quite a while now that I've never been able to share with them my pictures, or find out where he went next. The people who started this project seemed like cool kids, so my hope is that at least one of them is a Redditor, and if not, perhaps some of you have encountered these figures or their blog before, google completely failed me. But I know Reddit can do this! We’ve connected people with the cameras they’ve lost in other countries!).

Below are the pictures I took. Sorry about the poor quality, those same computer troubles that caused me to lose track of the site left me with only the very final pictures.

tl;dr - Some kids on the internet made an interactive art project. I helped by bringing a golden goose to Scotland. Haven't been able to find their site since. Help!

1345820132.0,yr89z,A few thoughts and observations after my first month of Geocaching.,DpThought0,28,5,9,"A little background - I signed up on the Geocaching website way back in 2005

I'm loving this hobby

- I live in the Philadelphia suburbs, some of which are only a 5-10 minute drive from home.  I *never* would have found these without Geocaching.

Notable one - http://coord.info/GC3B97E which is this tiny little park that has one of the largest trees in PA in it; a sycamore tree that's been around since the 1600s.  It's 2 blocks off of a road I've driven down hundreds of times

- One of my favorite aspects of this has been the history.  We have a local cacher who has many hides related to the local history of the area

- My first 20 or so finds were just done with a printout of a Google Maps page and the recent logs.  Obviously this wouldn't work for hides in the woods

- I read a lot of posts on this subreddit about people getting bored with this, and soon it's going to be something I need to plan to make a short trip for, rather than just grab one in a park on the way home from work. 

- I also see merits to the different types of hides.  I was at a large local park, dodging massive amounts of poison ivy, and getting torn to shreds by thorns.  All in 95 degree weather the day after a storm, so everything was soaked and steamy.  20 minutes of this and I left empty handed, and was totally craving a quick park and grab just as a confidence booster... and as a way to stay in my car's AC as long as possible.

- My 7 year old is a ""free pass"" to investigate caches.  I'm 6'8"" tall, he *loves* finding some of the lamp post hides - if anyone is in the parking lot, I pretend to make a cell phone call while he investigates the light pole skirt thing.  If people see us they just think he's a bored little kid messing around and I'm an inattentive parent, when in actuality we are having an awesome little father and son adventure.

- I've found several trackables from all over the world.  One of them that stood out was http://coord.info/TB48PQM, I have no idea whether a trackable I find needs to go in a particular direction.  This one was a no brainer.  My GPS (eTrex 20) does paperless Geocaching, but unless the trackable was mentioned in the last 5 logs, I have no idea about its destination.

- My family took a short vacation to the NJ shore

A notable shore find - http://coord.info/GC1AK8K  Just a magnetic keyholder

- I'm planning my first hides.  Spending this last month looking for caches has really shown me what think makes a good hide.  I read a post on here a while back where someone suggested that people be prevented from making hides until they have found 30 or 50 or something

The two series of hides I'm working on with my 7 year old ""helper"" are quite different.  My son was digging through a junk box in our garage when he stumbled across a perfect container for a ""Classic Arcade Game"" theme hide, ""Pac Man"" (or ""Ms. Pac Man""), and ""Asteroids"", all of which fit the theme and let me use unique containers and share a little bit of arcade history, which just so happens to be another one of my hobbies.

The second series is based off of a Solar System Walk (e.g. http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/events/solrwalk.html) that I had previously designed as a science project for school at my work. I'm planning on centering the sun on a town landmark, so they will be done as a multi puzzle with the actual hide ending on the orbit of the asteriod belt.  You will be able to walk this whole multi pretty easily, but after that you'll need to do some driving to get to the remaining planets. 

I have an overlay that I set up in Google Earth, but it's so far out there that you'd need to go over to the next town to find the GZ.

I have not found a single thing

I've tried looking right where the coordinates point
Absolutely no luck. 

I see dozens of messages where people have found the things I'm looking for and they all talk about how simple it was.   It's starting to mess with my head.

Is this because I've never seen one and I don't know what I'm looking for?    
Is there something huge about geocaching i'm missing?    
Could my map be *waaay* off?     

And why do people never put anything in the hints section of their cache *ever*?

1307791711.0,hx38g,Anatomy of a great cache hide,saldejums,25,3,12,"Hiding a quality cache is easy if you carefully consider how and where your cache is hidden. This article provides some basic guidelines to consider.


**1. Location!** A quality cache needs a good location, or a nice park, or something historical or bizarre. Make sure the area is not private property, and be careful hiding caches near RR tracks or federal buildings or bridges - most often caches in these locations will not be approved. If the cache has little to offer in the form of location, it should make up for it in some other manner.

Pay attention to what impact the location of the cache will make on it's surroundings. Imagine what the area will look like in different seasons and times of day - visiting muggles, and animal life. If the area is sensitive, make note in the description what steps the cacher should take to insure minimal damage.

**2. Hide!** A quality cache should be hidden well, it is doomed to be plundered. If the cache has little to offer in the form of the hide, it should make up for it in some other manner.

Pay attention to what impact the hide can play on the area. Imagine where cachers may look for the cache if they are not looking in the right place. Imagine less careful cachers removing surrounding items while looking for your cache. If the area is sensitive

**3. Variety!** A quality cache need not be like every other one in your neighborhood. If the area is full of 1/1's, hide a multi or an unknown or puzzle cache. Incorporate your interests or hobbies into the cache, and derive coordinates for the final stage from that.

**4. Properly rated!** An official unofficial rating system can be found at http://clayjar.com/gcrs/ Live it! Love it! Sometimes a cache turns out to be more or less difficult than intended

**5. Good Coords!** GPSrs are not as accurate as many think, but when the GPSr says it’s accuracy is 10 feet, it may not be. The best way to be sure is to revisit the cache site different times on different days before submitting the cache and average any of those that the accuracy is decent. Enter the averaged coords in your GPSr manually and go back to the site as if you were a cacher and see how close it takes you. In areas of good reception a couple tries is sufficient, but you may want to revisit more often in dense tree cover. If cachers continually note that the coords may be off, check them again and edit your cache page accordingly as soon as possible.

**6. Effort!** Nothing is more impressive than a cache that shows some effort. Historical information to go along with the cache site

**7. Good Containers!** Containers should be of decent construction and seal well. If it doesn't seal well, there are places when ammo boxes will not work, so just choose your container thoughtfully, especially if it's in an area where water, ice, animals, or other dangers might be a factor.

**8. Right size container for the area!** Not very often is there a need for a micro in the middle of a million acre forest nor is it safe to hide a .50 cal ammo box in a city alley. With a little forethought

**9. Good Contents!**You don't need to spend a fortune on contents, matches, alcohol, adult material, or other dangerous materials inside. And - NO FOOD OR SCENTED items! Animals can smell soap, food, scented candles, and such and come after your cache. Even an ammo box might not be safe from a crafty raccoon or a bear. Plus if any dampness gets in the cache

**10. Maintenance!** Check your cache on a regular basis. Obviously, but the responsibility is with the cache hider, not the finder!

**11. Disable where needed!** If a cache turns up missing or otherwise compromised and you intend to replace or repair it

**12. Archive when needed!** If a cache is missing or you have retrieved it, archive it! Event caches should be archived shortly after the event, when enough time has been given for visitors to log it (If someone is still late, they can still log an archived cache). If you archive your cache, you will need and volunteer to re-enable it if you do replace it, so do not archive if you plan to replace the cache soon.

**13. Communication!** Check your gc.com emails on a regular basis. Respond to emails concerning your caches. Send emails to finders if you have questions or just want to congratulate them - if your cache is their first, don't place a cache!

**14. Guidelines!** Before placing or submitting your cache

From what I understand, with a dedicated GPS, I'd have to search for caches while at my computer, transfer the info about the caches to my GPS, then once I find it, go back to a computer to log the visit.

I signed up on geocaching.com and looked up my address. Score: there was one about half a mile away, but i guess the free version just chooses a few near by, and it wouldn't choose the one i wanted (i can't afford the full app).  

So i looked on the map, so i figured i'd have a go at finding it anyway.  

Once i got there, i was about to give up, when i noticed a small, white tube in the bushes. From the path it was blocked by nettles, so i tried from the other side. I climbed over a few longs and pushed aside a few branches to get inside the bush, but it was still difficult to get to. There was no way i was going to reach it without getting scratched to pieces.  
Disappointed

It was a nice walk along a cycle path that i haven't been on for years, and i could see one not far away. I made my way over there and checked the map again, but it still said i was 50m away. Then i realised that i was facing east, not north, and i had walked past another, smaller bridge just seconds ago. 

As i got near, listened to some music, but they seemed determined to discuss eachother's life stories.

1284682557.0,deyij,I've been pondering making some very technically-challenging geocaches for geeks like me.  Good idea?,AMagill,22,4,42,"I've been toying with the idea of a series of geocaches with a high degree of technical challenge.  I'm thinking a number of different caches

A few of my ideas so far:

* A key

* A flashlight that flashes out a message at high frequency.  You must devise a way to capture and decode the signal.

* An exotic variety of barcode

* Enciphered text.  You must perform the cryptanalysis to break it- should be theoretically doable with pen and paper.

* Some device that only works between midnight and 1am.

* A device you have to 'sneak up' on- motion renders it inoperable for a time.


Things I'm trying to avoid:

* Any component of this being on the internet- like a link to download a file

* Flash drives

* Scary-looking devices that might cause a bomb scare.

* Any steps that cause the caches to be temporarily or permanently unsolvable.  No removing key items.

* Requiring any expensive tools or equipment.  Nobody (sufficiently clever) should have to spend more than $25 to solve it.


Any device I build as part of this will have to be very durable, tamper-proof, and inexpensive.  I'd prefer no accessible wires/contacts/metal whatsoever.  Probably not much more complex than lithium battery (ages and tolerates cold well), microcontroller (an MSP430 will run for years on a small battery), LEDs, and reed switches for any inputs (bring your own magnet!).

This would be done in the area of Boulder, though.  I might be willing to add a $100 First-To-Find prize.

Nothing wrong with Canadian money

Some rules I was thinking of...

(I'm in the US btw)

First off I'm planning on making it a premium cache.  I don't want it to get taken in the first week.

* Absolutely no US currency

    Bullalo nickles are cool and all but I really want modern foreign coins.

* Cachers can't replace the last of one currency with a currency that is already in the cache

    No taking the last Franc and putting in a Euro when there are 3 Euros already in the cache

* No North American Currency.  (I'm not 100% sure on this one

    I don't want coins from far away to be replaced with pesos from your spring break trip.

The only foreign coins I have right now are

* Belgium Franc

* French Franc

* South Korean Won

* Hong Kong Dollar

Only a few of each.  Nothing worth more than a dollar or two US.

Anyways

I went to GZ, not caches. Not exactly a geocaching clone, but after the initial excitement, it leaves a lot to be desired.

Now that I have the app, no tradables, no log book, nothing. Just a cold, QR code stuck somewhere.

I'll probably only go for more Munzees after I've found all the geocaches in a particular area and I'm still craving a hunt

1.	Does a dedicated GPS make a noticeable difference for finding caches or enhancing the experience? I’m currently using an iPhone5 but after a few bad experiences (DNF 3x in a row!) I’m wondering if a topographic map would be better for my area. For example, rock-strewn field.  I’d think that having a good map on the GPS would help determine which side of the trail the cache is on and therefore limit frustration. There were no hints for these particular caches. 

2.	In relation to #1

3.	Do you have a set time limit for giving up on finding a cache? After 30 minutes of unsuccessful searching for two in a row I was pretty discouraged and frustrated. Luckily I found the last one of the day but it could have turned into a bad first experience.

Besides these points I’m having a great time getting out doors and I’m really glad this subreddit exists.  Cheers!

When you hide a cache, since special equipment is required. I feel conflicted though, since the cache is hidden on a slow moving bend in the San Antonio River, where the water is almost perfectly flat. My cache details clearly state that a canoe or kayak is needed, I feel like I'm overrating it by making the terrain a 5.

The Little Free Library is a ""Take a book / leave a book"" community project that's really great. I am planning to build one in the Police Box / TARDIS shape from Doctor Who. And of course I want to make it even more awesome by adding a cache to it!

So what I was thinking was building a wooden box on the back side of the library box with a hinged lid and latch. Something weather proof. I thought this would be fun for cachers to find and also enjoy the library. (Maybe a note on the cache page - ""bring a book to share/trade""?)

I would put a sign/sticker on the top of the lid

* Do you think think I should just put the combination on the cache page so people can unlock it?
* Have it be the last four of the coordinates?
