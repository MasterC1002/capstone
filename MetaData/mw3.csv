&gt;Anything that can go wrong

* If an enemy player gets a Predator Missile
* A Predator Missile is in the air and you have Blind Eye equipped. Cool, or one of your team mates will try to escape the Predator Missile by sprinting towards you. 
* The second I decide to reload or check my back
* If I throw down a care package
* If I'm one kill away from winning a game of FFA and I happen to get killed, who is one kill behind me, will be spawned smack bang in the middle of things. Quickscopers and players using pistols-only will magically appear in front of his sight-lines.
* I'm watching a doorway because I'm 100% sure that somebody is inside and that he or she will come barging out at any moment.... I spend 10 seconds aiming down my sights
* Four enemy players have their backs to me. Either I'll panic
* I'm playing Infected and I'm holding down an area with my team mates. A lone infected player comes running around the corner and nobody seems to notice him. He breaks through the wall of SMG-wielding players that are surrounding me and focuses all of his efforts on infecting me with a 2-meter knife lunge.
* 2 kills away from a MOAB? Host Migration will fail.
* Your team mates are closer to the enemy? Doesn't matter. You'll be killed first anyway.
* An enemy chopper is in the air and you're trying to lock onto it with your Stinger. You'll spend 10 seconds waiting for it to reappear as it ducks behind tall buildings
* Your attack chopper will fly around taking aerial photographs while you're on a killstreak. As soon as you die and your streak is over
* You pick up a weapon that you don't normally use and beast with it. You equip it on one of your classes and you go 1-5 in the first minute.
* You decide to swap your claymore for some semtex. Half-way through the next game
* You decide to swap your semtex for a claymore. Half-way through the next game
* You get into a close gunfight and you need to reload. Instead of wasting your time with the reload animation
* You get a UAV and instinctively call it in. An enemy Counter UAV was already up.
* Patiently flank the enemy team. Your team mates spawn beside you.
* You run around the corner and your team mate is there
* Cooking a grenade? It'll bounce off the frame of the door and come right back at you.",self,t5_2rp9s,False,,360,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/qaca2/cods_law/

1321041851.0,m91m7,How not to suck at MW3 and increase your K/D ratio,cyrex,566,124,167,"**In celebration for #1 on r/MW3:   ~~EERL4KLY7Z  (it can be used twice)~~ I have 4 more codes if anyone wants to trade**

I went from .8 K/D to 1.5 in just 1 week back in MW2 following tips from Seananners on Youtube. The following is what I learned:

Kill death ratio is simply the number of kills divided by the number of deaths in a game. This number can change exponentially in both ways. When you get more kills

Improving your ratio can happen in 2 ways. More kills and less deaths. First, and finally you will get some great tips on how to get more kills. 


**Controller Sensitivity**

Ever see the enemy in your peripheral vision
**Exercise #1**
If your sensitivity is &lt; 5 go into your options and set your controller sensitivity to 10. RIGHT NOW. Just do it. If you are used to a low sensitivity and go to 10, drop your sensitivity down to 7. This is where you will really master controlling your aim. **After playing like this for a few days, pick the setting you like best and stay there. Ultimately, you will want to use whatever is most comfortable, even if its a 2 or 3.** 


**Exercise #2**

Play the spec ops training course until you can get the 3 star rating with your sensativity level. For new or inexperience players, aiming, movement, and timing. 


**Button Layout**

Go to your options and switch your button layout to Tactical. This will allow you to go prone in a moment's notice. It switched the prone and melee buttons. This also means it will be more difficult to recover from a missed knifing


**Theater Mode**

Go to your opens and turn theater mode off. Unless you actually want to use this feature


When I finally sat down to analyze why I sucked so much at CoD



**STOP SPRINTING**

More often than not, so just stop. What is the hurry anyway? 
**Exercise 2** 
Play 5 games and NEVER sprint. Not once. If you sprint


The second issue I worked on was preventing the deaths where I was simply in a bad position on the map. Ever notice, but I know I had a tough time with this. The middle of the map is so interesting! Guess what. You don't have to go there!.


**Stay on the edge of the map** 

If you stay on the edge of the map, and you really only have to worry about the enemy in 1 direction. You will learn maps faster this way too. If you stay only on the edges of the map, there are fewer perspectives to learn as far as where people might be positioned. The same goes for buildings. If you are inside a building **hug the wall** There is absolutely no reason to be out in the open, yet people do it all the time. If you are not touching a cover surface or the edge of the map, that should be your #1 goal. 


**Dying to killstreaks -- Don't do it** 

One thing that seems to be different in MW3, by far, the easiest deaths to prevent. If you have not yet devoted one of your custom slots to an Anti-air class, go do it now. For the love of FSM, just do it! Maybe everyone knows they can do it, but are thinking ""Surely someone else will shoot down the apache, so I won't bother."" Guess what, you can hide, airborn killstreaks. Once the Apache/AC130/Chopper Gunner/Osprey/etc is announced

Something new in MW3

Use EMP grenades. Kill SAMs, and you'll help your team. 


**Stop dying in a fair gunfight**

So another, or you lose your hit marker after a few hits and they are still alive, turn around and run away. Don't strafe, don't back up and hide, do NOT go prone behind that car. Turn the fuck around and run. For me, it was hard for me to accep that I had to cut my losses. **If they are hitting you and you aren't hitting them, you will die if you stay. RUN!** I don't mean, run away entirely. Move on. Your position was comprimised and if you poke your head there again



**Winning a gunfight**

Let's move on to increasing kills to improve our K/D ratio. Remember those lost gunfights I told you to run away from? What if you just stop losing them entirely? Besides just having enough time put in to learn to aim properly, try to fire in 2/3 round bursts. This allows you a faction of a second to makeup for the kick back of the gun. The further away your enemy, the less effective spraying them with bullets will be. If they are out in the open, aim at the body, not the head. If your sights are aimed at their feet when you pull the trigger, feel free to do a 4/5 round burst first and then 2/3 round bursts after. 

Also, or smash it with your finger, but squeeze it. Get used to the minimum amount of pressure it takes to actually fire. This may not make sense at first, but the same holds true with firing a real weapon. The idea is that you want to move the trigger to the point at which the weapon fires. The goal is NOT to make the trigger move as far as it can as fast as you can. Once you learn to do this, your trigger finger movements will be much more efficienty and your brain will hone in your hand/eye coordination that much faster.

From the [OFFICIAL RULES](http://www.rankupxp.com/Rules/):

&gt; **NO PURCHASE NECESSARY:** To receive one (1) free game piece and a copy of these Official Rules, 2011 to: *DewXP Promotion P.O. Box 760017, El Paso, TX 88576-0017*. Limit one (1) free game piece request per hand-addressed stamped outer envelope. No photocopies or mechanically reproduced requests will be accepted. Sponsors assume no liability for lost, late, stolen, illegible, misdirected

*Note about the following prices:* I took them from my local Wal-Mart; if anybody would have these products the cheapest it would be them. And regarding the cost of the special 20 packs of Mtn Dew

The max number of minutes you can add to a Gamer ID is 24 hours, but it is likely a simple 15 minute piece due to the ease with which it is obtained.

*****
    $0.44 * 96      = $42.24
    100ct envelope  = $5.94

    Total           = $48.18

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Product        Price   Mins.  $/min   # of units   Total cost
                                            to max

*****

In short: you can max out a Gamer ID with ~$50 and just mailing in for game pieces

*****

**UPDATE:** I previously neglected to include into my calculations the combat cards you recieve for each code you enter. As there are 15 in total and you're able to trade them, knocking out 90 minutes worth of codes and products you'll need to collect/buy. The corrected calculations are as follows:

    $0.44 * 90      = $39.60
    100ct envelope  = $5.94

    Total           = $45.54

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Product        Price   Mins.  $/min   # of units   Total cost
                                            to max

    24pk case      $7.48    --       --    --                  --
    20pk case     ~$6.80    90     0.08    15 cases       $102.00
    12pk case       4.38    45     0.10    30 cases        131.40

    11.5oz. bag     2.58    45     0.06    30 bags          77.40
    3oz. bag        1.28    15     0.09    90 bags         115.20

Something to take note of: While, as the game codes from Doritos are printed on the outsides of their packaging, there is a risk of someone having copied down the code without buying the chips and using the code themeselves. This is somewhat compensated for by the fact the Doritos codes can be used twice (albeit on separate DewXP accounts), but there's still the chance two people have had the same idea.

First I would like to start off by saying I'm not angry. If I don't get credit I won't care so much. I am happy enough knowing that millions of people will be playing a game mode that I invented.

Here's the story. On February 10th I made a game mode and my friend decided I should name it All or Nothing. I recorded it and uploaded to youtube and made this post:
[http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/pmb7v/i_think_i_accidentally_made_an_epic_game_mode/](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/pmb7v/i_think_i_accidentally_made_an_epic_game_mode/)

I was happy with what I made and since then  have been playing it with friends and MW3 players. My guess is that Bancandy saw it because she is the one who posted the news here:
[http://community.callofduty.com/message/205523060#205523060](http://community.callofduty.com/message/205523060#205523060)

What gets me though is I had no idea about this. Even without credit I would have expected a heads up. Can Bancandy or another IW member tell me what's going on? Even if I can't be given credit I would like to know what's happening.",self,t5_2rp9s,True,,360,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/rk1zj/i_am_the_creator_of_the_new_game_mode_being/

1320927605.0,m7c4g,Pro Tips MW3,Prankish,238,40,133,"So have been looking a lot at this sub-reddit since launch and have learned quite a few things and was thinking we could try and compile it into one large thread. 

Some tips/tricks I've seen so far:

* 
Specialist package has got to be the best for leveling. Using hardline it takes 1,7 kill(s) to get the 200 points for getting the perk. Also an extra 50 points for each kill after 7 is amazing considering your extremely effective with all the perks.
     * Another thing I love about the specialist package is that you get more kills with your gun rather than spending time using a kill streak such as osprey or AC130. I am currently working toward gold G36C and I want that bad boy soon.


* 
I believe this will be fixed but as of now i only use EMP grenade because killing a SAM or a Sentry seems to add a kill to my point streak? I can kill the equipment without putting myself in danger and I get a free kill toward my point streak. At least untill they fix this of course.
     * As effectsfire pointed out this is not a bug! Evidently this is intentional to encourage people to destroy point streak rewards. So take out those stingers and replace their point streaks with yours!
          EDIT: I believe this applies to capturing/destroying objectives as well.

* 
Kill confirmed seems to be the best game mode for leveling. Me and my buddy just share half of our kill points by letting the other take the tag. We are always getting a great amount of points. I only use specialist so I don't run into the problem of having to try and get a tag after I killed a guy halfway across the map with a predator. Denying kills is also great. One time I ran through and collected 6 tags at once. Quick 300 points not counting the kills themselves.  
     * As anEnglishman pointed out, has been considered that quickest way to gain xp. The only problem is that it is highly dependent on your skill because dying early in the round may mean no points at all. 

That's about all I can remember at this point. Any tips would be great and I will be editing this if I get any.

Tips from comments:
&gt;* 
ReeColi:   When people call out strafe runs

 
&gt;* 
rh1nos:   Try putting only 1 point streak on (e.g. UAV) so you can keep cycling through the same point streak. This will help you complete that point streaks challenges a lot quicker. 

&gt;* 
twenty0ne:   Use marksman
 
&gt;* 
loganz:   Ive been running support killstreaks (UAV and Ballistic Vests ONLY). If you play groundwar, and it stays there for a while... ive been consistently getting 8000-10,000 points per game (without double xp).
Also,000 XP etc).. There is no sense in using Double XP from the beginning, since points come slow, and you have no challenges to complete.

&gt;* 
BigStein:   If you're using the FMG9 machine pistol

*16. January 2012: Added some perks tips

------

**GENERAL GAMEPLAY**

* Laying prone and changing weapons make you kinda seem like a dead body (bmcclure937: Only with Assasin Pro
* Blinking spot icons mean someone is capturing them (if they are grey and blinking it's your team
* You can survive stealth bomber by lying prone directly under your trophy system. (by HybridFx)   
* You can quickly detonate C4. PC: press F twice. XBOX: press X twice. PS3: Press Square twice. You should never detonate any other way. (by HybridFx)   
* Stealth bombers become visible in the radar when you have color-blind mode enabled. Activate this in option menu where you adjust sensitivity.
* Jump and knife a ladder before climbing for quicker weapon draw at the top. (by bmcclure937)
* If you hear a bouncing betty go off
* Sprinting or double tapping change weapon is a quick way to cancel your reload if you are doing so while an enemy is about to shoot you. (Sprinting seems to be most recommended.)
* Planting prone paralell to a bombspot gives better cover in some spots.
* Knifing a Recon Drone and Ballistic Vests destroys it.
* [Yomega260 tips channel.](http://www.youtube.com/user/yomega260/featured)
* [cyrex's How to not suck at MW3 thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/m91m7/how_not_to_suck_at_mw3_and_increase_your_kd_ratio/)


**QUICK XP**   

* [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/nllyr/leveling_tip_use_your_secondaries/)
* [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/oavcd/mw3_protips_collection_thread/c3fwhj7)
* Kill Confirmed is generally agreed upon as the quickest way to get XP. Team Defender is also good.
* SnD is a slow way to level weapon XP
* Recon Drone is a great way to get XP. You get XP for each tag
* Do the daily and weekly challenges.
* Specialist package grants large XP. Use Hardline making the 1st Kill +100 and every other kill +100. When you reach 7 kills w/o dying you're rewarded 500xp. Change up the perks often to get challenge XP. (by untempered_schism)  
* Leveling up guns to gold is not a good way to get XP
* An easy way to get XP is from using Extreme Conditioning Pro and Dead Silence Pro. Find an object you can mantle and just go up and down for a while
* For weapon XP, etc), count towards weapon XP. Also, weapon challenges will count as well (Marksman, Expert, Veteran, Mastery, etc).


**PERKS TIPS**  

* ""Holding your breath"" while aiming down the sights with a non-sniper rifle counts towards Marksman Pro
* Easiest way to get Sitrep Pro is by planting your Trophy System and knifing it each time you spawn (it counts as enemy equipment destroyed).
* Dick move
* Easiest way to get Recon Pro: Team Defender
* Blind Eye: Every enemy killstreak counts, etc. Use together with sitrep. Remember to take out CUAVs aswell as UAVs. When you cant find the UAV just lock onto the sky and spin around until you hear beaping.
* Overkill Pro: Equip your favorite SMG as your seconddary, althought your KD might suffer if this isn't your normal playstyle.


**WEAPONS/EQUIPMENT TIPS**   

* Scrambler works as Blind Eye inside it's area (enemy helicopters and air killstreaks wont see you).
* Jumping while tossing grenades/flashes/stuns/C4 allows for more distance. (by bmcclure937).
* Dual FMG9s can take out a juggernaut in less than a clip.
* Dual Five Sevens have instant reload with Reload Cancel (by bmcclure937)
* Extended magazines increases starting ammo as well. (by HybridFx)
* Crouching and laying prone grant huge accuracy bonuses to LMGs and Sniper Rifles (i.e. less sway and recoil).
* Stinger can lock onto Assault Drones.  
* Stinger can lock onto Recon Drone
* The Stinger ""sticks up"" and can reveal your position behind low cover.
* The longer you aim down the sight the more weapon sway you experience. Counter this by quickly reaiming.
* Play Hardcore modes to level up your shotguns faster. ([thread by TheLoganBoy](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/nwyqd/need_help_leveling_up_your_shotgun/))
* Javelin can lock onto friendly air support and almost anything else.
* The javelin has a huge impact radius.
* Aim javelin into a room to make it launch into the room and explode in the roof (will wipe out entire rooms).
* Emp destroys senteries and recon drones. 
* [Learn about XM-25
* Trophy system takes out Predator Misseles, AC-130 bombs in addition to nades/flashes/c4.
* From a crouching or prone position

**KILLSTREAK TIPS**

* Shooting down helicopters, destroy SAM, senteries, etc, capping flags, points in domination and all missions count towards your killstreak.
* Shooting down Strafe Helicopters will shoot down the two next to it
* When using a killstreak with laptop
* Specialist bonus gives you every weapon proficency in the game from every gun tier. Kick, Breathe, Speed, Melee and etc (by HybridFx) *EXCEPTION: Shotguns do not get damage proficency.* 
* Recon Drone can tag enemy UAV so they show up on radar.   
* Two active UAVs make the line go faster; three active UAVs makes at an Advanced UAV; four active UAVs make AUAV sweep faster.
* Use Hardline and only Assault UAV selected for quick UAVs that build up to AUAV.
* Alternativly use Hardline and only Support UAV and CUAV selected.
* Press R1 (PS3) when using predator to give it a speed boost.

1325851278.0,o5c4s,MW3 Multiplayer Tips,blobber109,214,45,237,"1. Recon Drones can activate enemy Bouncing bettys
    If you have tagged everyone in a SnD round then you could move on to looking for BBs

2. You can shoot enemy ballistic vests until they disappear for 100 points

3. You can 'target' friendly aircraft with your javelin to aim at a position that you can't see

4. Teammates spawning mean area is clear of enemies (Hopefully)

5. If you can count on your gun skills in TDM don't head to the area where there is a gun battle going on; flank around the back for all the kills

6. If you have an un-silenced weapon for you primary it is a good idea to have something like a silenced MP9 or Scorpion secondary for if you want to do flanking without the enemy turning around and noticing you

7. For faster XP use a lot of different guns during your ranking up. The easy challenges that you get at the start of using a weapon do boost your XP quite a bit

8. If you find a good choke point and you have an LMG or sniper lay down. In MW3 they have made it so when you are prone sway on LMGs and Snipers is **heavily** reduced.

9.Have a stinger class ready for when you hear Ac130

10.Do the daily and weekly challenges. They will sometimes just be to jump 15 feet and survive and that would be a free 1000 Xp or get 50 kills within a short period of time of ADS with quickdraw on

11. If you find your K/D sky rocketing and your Win/Loss plummeting jump on TDM. Right now it's full of Christmas noobs and if you have good gun skills or map knowledge you can 'lone-wolf' TDM

12. If a frag is thrown into a room with a few teammates and it is rolling around then pick it up. You may suicide but it will stop the enemy getting a triple

13. Rapid fire and silencer on a Sub is an unbeatable combo. Guns such as the PP90M1 or P90 are still effective at long range with burst fire but they can kill faster than shot guns at close range

14. If you hear a bouncing betty spinning off go prone. They do no damage to you when you are prone

15. When smashing glass knife cancel. This works best on tactical layout as you have to knife

16. Play different gamemodes to keep the game fresh. You'd be surprised by the differences

If I think of anything else I'll add them later.

I do realise that some of you may know these already but I have seen some comments that would suggest that maybe others don't.

There are countless more people without Elite Premium than there are with it. You guys outnumber us immensely. Yet it feels absolute AWESOME to be in this super privileged minority, so I get it before *ANYONE* else). We get cool features on the Elite site. We get our own bat-shit super-cool playlist even. 

**This is all completely

1. **The Elite Website**
A lot of you already know this so I will keep it short. The Elite site is a total joke. It touts detailed stats, you *still get prompted to log in* and even *upgrade to Elite Premium* despite already having it. It's completely and totally broken. I have been a web designer for over eight years, and I know what goes into making a great site. Elite is not a great site, but perhaps a polar opposite. Strangely enough, it was designed by one of the most amazing web design firms out there (2advanced). 

2. **The Elite Concept**
When Elite was first announced

3. **Getting content early**
In theory this is awesome, I can't play the maps with non-Elite members, and I can't play the game types that I want on them. **The playlists don't even exclusively feature the new maps. I have to play three matches of Headquarters on Bootleg before even having a chance to vote for a new map.** As an EP member, I desperately want to play with the hundreds of thousands of players not in our playlist, and not with the 15k or so that are. 

4. **Elite Playlists...are terrible**
The options for game modes are very limited in Elite Playlists, if that didn't mean being forced into try-hard mode for every match.** If I want a casual game on a new map, forget about it. My only options are to enter beast mode and still be raped in the butt by the 6-man teams that run rampant on the Elite playlist.

5. **The content is not even that good**
One or two new maps every month is not more than previous COD titles. Oh, it's just not any better than what Treyarch and IW have always been releasing. It's not revolutionary. You know what would be? New guns, new perks, new killstreaks. THAT'S some DLC that I would gladly call new and exciting. Releasing 1-2 maps every month instead of 3-5 maps every four months is not fucking innovative.

3. They're immature 8-15 year old brats who respond to everything you say with ""YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU STUPID GAYFAGGOTNIGGER.""

4. They're in a group of friends talking about some random inconsequential shit. They refuse to make a god damn party and talk there. ""YO DAWG
""YEAH DAWG""
""YO BRODAWG WE SO WASTED""
""YA BRO WE SO FKKIN WASTED HOLY SHIIIIIITTEEEE""

5. The constant bitching from the guy who is last place on your team. ""YOU GAYFAGGOTNIGGERS ALL SUCK DICK! STOP PLANTING THE BOMB! WHY WONT ANYONE PLACE CLAYMORES AROUND ME! FUCK YOU STOP SHOOTING THE ENEMY WITH YOUR SNIPERS U FAGGAAATROOONAODIR*&amp;^@^%@!""

6. Your crappy taste in music is playing in the background

7. You breathe like a fucking lunatic. This can be excusable if you're having sex/recently transformed into a puppy

8. Women. Of the three girls I play with regularly on MW3, but they may be interested in a friendship if you don't come off like someone who recently coated their lips with santorum.

9. BRODAWGS. You know these guys, something most of us normal fucking people find interesting.

EDIT: Keep the tips coming! I am adding a list below based on the comments so far.

* 3 UAVS at the same time from different people on the same team become Advanced UAV
* With Color Blind Mode enabled you can see enemy Stealth Bomber
* Sitrep will tell you if an enemy care package is real or not
* You can level up your sitrep by deploying and then destroying your own Trophy System
* On an enemy strafe run
* Get Blast Shield Pro (immune to flash and stun nades) by blowing up barrels and cars while standing next to them
* Turn off theater mode for less lag
* Specialist killstreak + hardline = fast leveling up of pro perks (can get hardline pro in a few games)
* When using specialist
* Shooting down air support, and assists (with hardline pro), all count towards killstreaks
*Assassin will keep you from being seen by UAV/AUAV
* Juggernauts have about 500 health, 5 knives also does the trick. When someone has a jug on your team, let them enter a firefight first, draw fire, then you enter in and kill everyone doing the shooting
* Bouncing Betties don't affect you when in prone
All weapons (at least ARs and SMGs
* If you clear all your Assault Killstreaks and use only UAV and hardline

It actually is listed on the COD Wiki so I'm aware that some of you may already know of this but I just thought I'd share this little tidbit for those that don't.

EDIT: Another tip: Recon Drones can trigger motion-sensitive explosive devices such as Claymores which can help your team as the Drone can take the hit instead of a teammate and if you're nimble enough you may even be able to escape unscathed (Note: I also noticed that Stalker Pro does not help in delaying the timer on Claymores/I.M.S. while using the Recon Drone)",self,t5_2rp9s,True,,psn,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/oab6p/protip_recon_drone_can_tag_enemy_uavs/

The other day I ran into a whole clan of chirping preteens on SND. Loud and obnoxious in the lobby, and as is often the case when playing solo against organized teams, my team was getting wrecked. They were decent players, and playing to win.

Now I'm not all that huge about winning

Not only did I hear huge ""WOOOOOWS"" and ""YOU FAGGOT"" after every kill (especially that stupid doublekill, stop using your weapons"" type stuff. So I decided I'd try and win it just to see them blow up.

I ended up going 18-3, so I stuck around figuring my luck would run out eventually. Then I won. Again, and again, and again. I won 5-6 games in a row, carrying my team most of the time. It was glorious.

-At first the maps irritated me coming from MW2 and black ops but I like the near constant action in contrast to the sometimes stale moments in black ops and mw2.

-I enjoy that not all maps are open so that certain killstreaks dominate regardless. Reaper and ac-130 not going well on arkaden? Ims and assault drone to the rescue.

-Within the first 30 seconds of spawning someone will either run by you or you'll run past their spawn.

-Figure out certain player's strategies because towards the end when all the support streaks start flying you'll want to know how to get those last few kills fast.

-The higher the rank of opponents the more likely you'll want to run dead silence.

-Pick up someone's gun BEFORE you think you need it. 

-When you kill someone expect them to come back and try to counter specifically how you killed them.

-With an unsilenced gun every kill/shot will make enemies flock to you. Depending on your map knowledge and how secure the area is either move away quickly or establish a defense.

-Note where you spawned

-Expect the stuff you hate and you think is overpowered. It's likely that what annoys you the most will be what you run in to the most often.

-Reload under cover

-Corner campers are usually lower level and stay exactly where they spawn. If you know the map

-Most of your deaths will be to one person simply because you two are playing the game in a way that will create constant clashes between the two of you. I.e. If you're rushing you're less likely to encounter the people who patrol an area.

-The portable radar is like a teammate

-The IMS right near a spawn is hilarious. Don't put it or C4 exactly on a spawn as you have temporary explosive immunity when you respawn.

-Watch killcams. Notice details and exploit them. Seeing that an enemy is using something other than sleight of hand makes me use cover more until the reload comes.

I have a theory that they only people who don't constantly moan about this (or any other) game are those over 30 who

1321000603.0,m8itd,Infinity ward seems to ignore Treyarchs improvements to the series. Why?,LeonWG,112,17,122,"Treyarch tends to release their games with slight improvements over what Infinity ward had done previously. Instead of adopting these improvements into the series in general

1. Xp for assists which are proportional to the damage dealt ranging from 20 to 80 xp per assist in TDM. Treyarch has done this since World at war but the modern warfare series continues to award every assist with 20 points regardless of the extent to which you contributed to the death of an enemy.

2. Awarding a kill to the player which put an enemy in last stand (final stand in the case of mw3) rather than awarding the kill to the player who killed him when he was already on the ground. Treyarch patched this into Codbo to everyones satisfaction but Infinity ward took a step backwards and reverted to the old system with final stand. (at least they removed last stand)

3. Displaying objectives captured and defended in the score boards of objective based games. This was in codbo but not in mw3. It is a real shame because it encourages objective oriented playing rather than trying to rack up an impressive amount of kills.

Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. Id just like to know why they decided to ignore these obvious improvements. I cant think of a logical explanation. ",self,t5_2rp9s,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/m8itd/infinity_ward_seems_to_ignore_treyarchs/

##What is spam?

If your sole purpose for using Reddit is to promote your own Youtube channel

##Can I post my own videos?

Yes... IF you are a contributing member who takes part in the community or Reddit as a whole. If you regularly contribute to Reddit via comments etc and other non-YT-based-submissions

##What's a spam filter?

The Reddit anti-spam script runs every time you submit something. It vets your account and it can be extremely sensitive. If it thinks that you might be spamming

* You own a new account and you are posting links.
* Your last submission received more downvotes than upvotes.
* You're posting a link to a website that has already been previously marked down as spam.
* You used alt accounts to upvote your own submission (yes
* You setup an alt account to try and avoid the spam filter (yes
* You deleted a post and tried to re-submit it.
* Your previous submission was confirmed as being spam by a moderator.
* You keep posting links to the same websites / YT channel.

##What's the review process like?

On any given day, your account will be looked at and it will be determined whether or not you're a contributing member. If you're a regular contributor, your post will be approved and it will be pushed to the top of the new queue. If you're a spammer, you'll be tagged as a spammer and all of your future posts will go into the spam filter. Note that this isn't the case for every subreddit. On most subreddits, moderators don't even review the spam filter because of the work that is involved. They just leave you to rot.

##I saw a spammer
If you see a spammer, the report will be ignored.

**1)** Please above all else, if you do nothing else, please do equip sitrep, it can win matches.

**2)** Take a trophy

**3)** Standing in the center of the DZ will get you killed by a package 9 times out of ten.

**4)** Lay down and aim towards points of entry.

**5)** Leave shitty care packages where they are. They provide cover and the time to take to grab a CP leaves you open to getting killed, they are are fucking usless. Also lay down behind the CP before you pick it up. 

**6)** Right after a DZ switches, when you kill enemies, they will spawn close to the new DZ allowing them to get there before you, in fact get yourself killed, it gives you the advantage.

**7)** If you happen to be close to a really decent CP left in an old DZ which happens to be closer to you than the new DZ

**8)** Blast shield or assassin are great perks and quick draw somewhat if you are using the trophy or the agonizingly slow tactical insertion. I have two DZ classes

**9)** Don't use your trophy system as cover, deploy it and shift to the right or left.

**10)** Good defensive streaks like the IMS or sentry gun should only be deployed if there is at least 20 seconds left in the DZ, nothing worse than using your pred missle on one bozo only to have a DZ with 5 enemies in it later and no missile to take them out.

In the end its your game and you payed for it so play how you want. You want to stand in the middle of the map picking guys off beefing up your KDR without really helping, then play smart and maybe my tips will help. Killers do have their role in DZ and if that's what you are good at setup somewhere that you can take out the enemy as they get close to the DZ, leave the capping to others. 

This is how I play and I am not here to brag

1343284234.0,x6eq0,Guide To Sniping (No Quickscoping),documents1856,119,37,79,"I have been seeing a lot of people asking for sniping tips, if he has his tips to offer they are more than welcome. This isn't quick scoping

***Setups*** (These are essential

**Primary Sniper Rifle**

* Variable Zoom
* Stability

Variable zoom allows you to be able to scan a large area of the map without unscoping

**MP9**

* Silencer 

The MP9 is almost an SMG in it's self, where you are in close quarters and it would be preferable to keep your exact location more ambiguous.

**Bouncing Betty**

This is far more easy to conceal than a Claymore which could be spotted with its red prongs

**Portable Radar**

This is the most essential tool that can be offered. Sniping requires good situational awareness, it is likely that his buddy will set your radar off. Also when you are scoped in you lose the mini map and it's audible beep when someone is in range is a good heads up to switch to your secondary.

**Blind Eye**

To be an effective sniper you must be able to operate regardless of the situation, making them vulnerable to you, and you less vulnerable to them as opposed to you running in the open to shelter. **If you choose not to use Blind Eye, please equip a trophy system so your set up will not cost the lives and sprees of friendly snipers next to you, Scramblers will hide your red box but will notify everyone around of your presence.**

**Assassin Pro**

YOU MUST USE ASSASSIN. Sniping is about stealth, the sniper house in Bakaara, on the cliff on village through a giant mess of leaves. Having your name shown will get you killed, there is nothing more to it than that. As a sniper blast shield is useless, Hardline won't mean a thing if you can't maintain a streak (you should be using Assault streaks), Overkill is useless since you should swap out your secondary the moment you can, and don't get me started on Quickdraw

**Marksman**

Obvious choice here

**Assault Kill Streaks**

* Reaper
* AC-130
* Osprey Gunner

Now this is very much up to you, you could also use sniping as a good and safe way to become OMA and grabbing primaries from fallen soldiers to enjoy the perks of OMA.

**Martyrdom/Dead Man's Hands**

I know this is looked down upon but if you have been killed that many times trying to take a position you'd be pissed enough to consider this a reasonable streak to use. If it is gained by being sniped then it is totally useless and revenge may be more useful.

My idea is to skip every other online community. I think Reddit is perfectly sufficient to fulfill the goal of this survey. Even if I can't reach 50 submissions in /r/mw3

For a bit of background: I'm a graduate researcher and have decided to study the usability of video games. It would have been far too easy to study the usability of websites or brooms or thermostats. I chose video games and felt MW3 was an excellent candidate for initial research.

*If you feel generous and would like to spare a bit of time to submit the survey, or phone number. That information is optional. If you decide to submit that data, it will be used for research purposes, then destroyed. That data is not required, though.* 

***Survey link removed

Thanks

----------------------------------------------
**Edit #1**: Wow! An excellent response! Thanks to all for the kind words and suggestions. Considering some of the feedback, I'm interested in studying the usability of video games, not using personal information for malicious purposes. I truly hope these adjustments have helped assuage concerns about the legitimacy of this survey. One final note: this survey has full [IRB approval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) from my university. I felt it was relevant to mention this to help remove any fears from survey participants.

----------------------------------------------
**Edit #2**: Absolutely unreal. MW3 is incredible. Not only have you lot assisted in improving the survey, but **I must thank everyone** who has taken the time to submit the survey. The more responses received, the more work I'll have in analyzing the results, but THAT'S OKAY. If the survey suddenly spikes in responses and ends up with hundreds of rows of usable data, I'll probably weep a bit (combo of fear &amp; happiness). Anyway - thanks everyone - locating willing survey participants isn't normally easy or fun.


----------------------------------------------
**Edit #3**: I wanted to provide a quick update while I have some time. According to the rows, so far.

Firstly, I couldn't get hitmarkers. After some further testing with other proficiencies on the Striker, we found that the range I could hit him out once I'd picked up his Striker was identical to that of a Striker w/o the Range proficiency. 

Next

Penultimately, and it was clear Kick does not carry over. We did the same with Focus, except shooting eachother instead of a wall. It was clear that we flinched much less with our own Focus gun than with a picked up one.

Impact was the last proficiency - we tested how many bullets it took to kill me through the Dome with Impact on and Impact off

Finally, JackCuff with a naked MK46. I won the race (obviously), then he picked up my M60 and we had another race. If proficiencies carried over, then we would have tied, but I still won the race.

For science.


Switching to your secondary(if not a launcher) instead of reloading while in a fire fight.

Running away from fights where the enemy sees you first.

Burst firing

When moving around the map keeping your crosshairs in places where the enemy could be instead of looking down at the ground.

When surprised hipfire then ads. Goes well with the tip above

Playing an area of the map like you would If the entire map consisted of just that area.(Sounds weird but trust me it helps because you tend to expect more situations)

Waiting until 1 kill after you get a streak to call it in. A lot of times I used to get killed right after I got the predator because I was so excited to get it that I forgot that I just killed someone who probably wasn't alone.

If you're in one area of the map and none of your teammates are there. Back track after ever kill...just kinda going back and forth since most likely you're near their spawn and will get shot from behind.

Not really a situational skill but using every weapon in the game up to 500-1000 kills will teach you a TON of stuff. From route running

In addition playing without assassin or a silencer will teach you how players react with always knowing your position.

Certain map spots are death traps. For example I never go in the pipe on hardline or that one hallway on lockdown. Death traps.


*Edit: more thoughts

Certain game types will make you focus on different things and could make you better overall. 

FFA: How to handle not having someone watching your back

KC: I tend to have to react faster in KC games than other modes

GW: People are everywhere and will have at least one person to counter every strategy you try

SND: Patience young grasshopper. You must learn it.

DOM: Game awareness

HC Mode: Learning to die less the hard way.

Also I learned how to do several things by focusing solely on that aspect for a few games. 

To learn to intuitively pick up weapons on a streak(it's a valuable skill to not use your gun til it's out of ammo) I ran recon with a rapid fire smg so I'd have to react quickly to not having ammo.

I took sleight of hand off on close quarters maps to teach myself reloading under cover.

STEP 2: 
Go to your Xbox Live Bio and change your whole Bio until it consists of stars and different characters from foreign languages. The point of this is to make anyone that reads your Bio have to squint to read what it says. This states you're too cool for letters and have to make your own. Now thats MLG status!


STEP 3: 
Scream about everything. If you're not loud you want to be noticed and the point of have MLG status is to be noticed. Practice this by entering pub matches and yelling about every death you get, YOU HAVE HOST SCRUB! This lets everyone in the game know that you only died by luck not skill.


STEP 4:

Notice the ""_cls"" at the end which makes it sound like a classic map.
Not sure if this will be free though

All of the other preview files in the .iwd file are for the other DLC maps that have been released or announced (the ""_ss"" ones might be the face off maps).

1344104662.0,xogyl,Thought I would share a Quick tip: Easy way to get Sitrep Pro without Boosting,rokkuranx,83,15,41,"Was able to get Sitrep Pro in about 10 games (seems like quite a bit but isn't really) today and was quite amazed. Usually I just ran around looking for equipment on the map to try and destroy it

What you want to do is play Drop Zone

 &gt; Primary: Shotgun (your choice)

 &gt; Secondary: Stinger/Javelin

 &gt; Lethal: C4

 &gt; Tactical: Trophy System

 &gt; Perk 1: Blind Eye

 &gt; Perk 2: Blast Shield

 &gt; Perk 3: Sitrep

 &gt; Deathstreak: Martyrdom

All you want to do is PTFO. Get to the drop zone and place your trophy system down and sit on the drop zone until you are killed

I'll explain why:

Any grenade thrown towards the trophy system will count towards Sitrep Pro. C4 is a bit buggy, keep an eye out for motion sensors, tactical insertions and other trophy systems. Tac insertions are most common because of the ""1337 SniPzoRz"" that play that lobby going for montage feeds, need to be close by.

Now the easy question is why not EMP grenade. Well you can

If you want

I will also note, ran in to knife it, for the destroy only to be killed by it. You don't have to, but I was dedicated in getting it.

1340050836.0,v8nwx,"Questions Reddit asked BanCandy have been answered, part 1",Excellenze,78,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/v8nwx/questions_reddit_asked_bancandy_have_been/

* Is there any chance of changing the spawns for sabotage and other game modes?

-Our current focus is improving matchmaking and lag

* Is there any chance of removing the quickdraw effect on sniper rifles and/or reduce the ability of quickscoping?

-Not in this game

* Will the shotguns, PM-9 and Riot Shield get reworked and will some of these weapons receive a buff?

-We’re always looking into weapon improvement for those that aren’t getting much use. Can’t speak on specifics with these weapons but I know these are ones people would love to see receive buffs. We just buffed LMGs.


* Why do Frag grenades seem to roll towards players that are uphill?

-No logical explanation for that… If it does happen it is definitely a glitch. If you have a video I’ll take a look!

* Will there be an update on infected weapons and the equipment that's used?

-We are pushing for an update yes. Not sure how soon it’ll be as we’ve been all booked up with the Face Off mode recently.

* Are any maps from previous CoDs going to be introduced eventually?

-Hopefully

* Will the AK74u or any other ""new"" gun be released soon?

-No new weapon DLC any time soon. This is something we want to look into though and if we can we’d like to do it as free content. Don’t know if we have to memory to support it now though.

* Will the dead silence/sitrep pro bug be fixed soon?

-Yes

* Will the map glitches on Oasis and Foundation be fixed soon?

-Yes

* Any news on more lag compensation fixes/tweaks?

-We’re focusing on fixing this now

* Will a tweak to sleight of hand or quickdraw speed up the ability to reload/shoot again on the spaz or 1887?

-Sleight of hand would increase the speed but would affect all the weapons with that perk a change to the asset animation timing would be the better way to decrease reload time.

* Will DMH receive any form of a nerf?

-Yes

* Any chance of a game mode designed for quick scopers only? FFA style game where they can vote on the map and rifle being used.

-We are toying with the idea of having a snipers only playlist. Would probably allow them to choose which rifle they want though.

* Will the pistols be switched up in AoN and/or One in the Chamber?

-I’ll find out if we can

* Will there be any penalty for players camping in 1 spot/area for longer than 10 seconds on OiC

-No plan for it

* Will there be a way to ""kill"" a guest account (and destroy the TI) that is blocking doorways on Infected?

-Unfortunately no

* Will there be more support for Hardcore gametypes, etc.?

-I want this yes! I love hardcore so I’m hoping we can fit in a HC ground war or HC Face Off.

* Will the ability to kill teammates equipment in Hardcore be removed? If not will the benefit of it counting toward Sitrep Pro be removed? 

-Nope

* Will Ballistic Vests in Hardcore receive any kind of a nerf to balance out the effect it gives the player compared to Core? 

-No plan for that right now. Is it bad? I know it is annoying but does it really make the game unbalanced?

* Why do Hardcore players not have all the same Gameplay modes that Core players have? 

-Hardcore isn’t as popular. We’re looking to add more choices though.

* Will there be any updates to the Mercenary playlist

-Probably not

* Will there be an option to alert/ask you if you want to join a game that is about to end or sitting at a crazy score

-Unfortunately don’t have the tech for this in MW3 but I know this is one of the features we really want in our next game.

* Will there be any improvements to being put in the same game/lobby 3+ times in a row or more after you back out of it or quit the game mid-match?

-Yes

* Will unranked lobbies ever be introduced? Just to screw around in and not have your stats go down (or up)? Or at least just make infected, etc not count towards k/d or w/l and just use them to have fun on?

-It’s on my list of suggestions but this is one that is less desired by the majority of the community. We’ll see what happens.

* Can the riot-shield's hit detection be changed or modified somehow? This way when someone is shooting you, but it's infuriating when someone can just run around you and you have no way to defend against it.)

-We can look into it yes

* Will it be possible to turn the aim-assist feature on and off?  Or at the very least, but it'd make it easier to go up against them instead of facing what's effectively a shotgun at all ranges.

-An on/off option is often suggested. We’ll look into this for our next project.

* Is there any way/chance head glitching will be fixed?

-Probably not possible this game since it would require major changes to maps. This is something we can have QA do more passes on for our future titles.

* Will there be a fix for the auto-loss issue?

-Yep

* Is there any chance of removing noob tubes from hardcore? 

-Probably not, we could look into setting up a Hardcore squared playlist that has hardcore rules but no explosives if this is something a lot of the community desires.

* Is it possible to remove death streaks from every game mode and stealth bombers removed from support killstreaks. 

-Sorry but no

* Is it possible to sort out European lobbies from North/South lobbies

-Yes we are working on an update for this; it’ll match regions to the party hosts too. If the party host is in Europe but the host is in US then they could still possibly match.

* Will the PC support be coming soon?

-We’ll have an update to PC very soon!",self,t5_2rp9s,False,,special,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/v8nwx/questions_reddit_asked_bancandy_have_been/
