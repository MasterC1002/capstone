&gt; ""I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror: a dead king
&gt; ""A wedding""  
&gt; ""Exactly""  
&gt; - ninth episode of season two about his forthcoming brother from season three

[Your journey is over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUg7bHErk1s&amp;feature=youtu.be). This was THE moment we've been all waiting for

**TL;DR: Explaining scenes - Trivia from books - Many errors that you're free to correct so I can polish (pun intended) the text**

This week

Warning: Might contain some information about future episodes - for example if there is something I think helps understanding the story and it gets mentioned in the next episodes, or rather lack of them, in season 2 - my followups back then contained parallel story of Bran that contained Reeds in it even though they haven't been cast yet.

-----

Usually I go on location by location in the order of their first appearence in the episode. This week we'll do it the GRRM way: first write about everything else

* This is the first episode since ""The Kingsroad"" to have no scenes in King's Landing. It's also the first one since ""You Win or You Die"" without Tyrion Lannister's appearence.

* I would like to list all the major characters who held political power that died on screen in the last seasons for you to see something. Keep in mind this is a quite subjective selection. Season one: Viserys Targaryen, a total of two. Season three (so far): Jeor Mormont, Kraznys mo Nakloz, Rickard Karstark, Robb Stark, (arguably major) Catelyn Stark. Point is that with the count of four to five it evens season 3 with 1 while it covers only the first half of *A Storm of Swords* and believe me, this is far from over. Total named body count is AGOT 54, ASOS 97.

* The Sam scene, expect book readers to be very excited.

* This is the moment when Rickon Stark and Osha the Wildling Woman disappear from the books. Now you understand all those jokes about Rickon: he said in this episode more lines than throughout 6000 pages of all books combined. It doesn't mean we won't see Osha in the show

* Bran mentions his great-great-(many times) grandfather, with the help of giants), he also took part in building Storm's End, capital castle of Stormlands and seat to House Baratheon (the one Robert gave to Renly, we haven't seen it, but the shadow baby birth happens in a tunnel beneath it. It's complicated.)

* As you see

* Yunkai... I'm impressed - no new names, and no dragons.

* Hound's story isn't supposed to be common knowledge. In fact the books don't mention anybody else than Sandor and Gregor knowing it and Sansa is being told it by Clegane himself

* We're getting close to the Twins, just before Arya's) but the rule of thumb is that POV characters don't die that easily.

-----

Don't you think writing about it is easy or that I waited for this to happen.

* ""Was it Melisandre's leeches?"" - Who the hell knows. All we know is that she can see the future (""Death by fire is the purest death"")

* ""Red Wedding"", there are more weddings to come and get their own colour.

* Once you go back to the beginning of season 3

* We've been bombareded with ""Rains of Castamere"" (first time we've heard it it Tyrion whistlign in S02E01, I forgot how it went"").

* I think the biggest ""Oh God

* Boltons have been loyal to Starks for the last few centuries

-----

Well... let's get this over with. I've already listened to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjR2NaCuzF8) over 20 times (I'm not kidding

* You might remeber that the emissary from Yunkai reached for the cup to drink in a very swift and strange gesture. The Guest Right is an ancient custom that guarantees everyone eating and drinking by the host's table his hospitality. Once the emissary drank from the cup

* Lord Walder's signature line is his ""heh"". Now you know.

* Don't get me wrong

* None of the kings is a POV character. We see Robb's story through eyes of Catelyn and her perspective doesn't really help cope with the scene. She freaks out right when musicians start playing *Rains of Castamere* and recalls Roslin Frey crying. Her despair and how gruesome the events got made many readers throw the book. Literally. Her last thought is ""No, Ned loves my hair"".

* Robb's last words are ""Grey Wind"". Most popular interpretation, but the result would essentially be seeing Robb dying twice. I think seeing what could be described as second death of Eddard Stark was quite enough.

* Oh and about that one: This was a huge shocker for the readers as Jeyne Westerling

* Blackfish was the second one not present at the wedding in the books so he's probably quite alive.

Do we really want to get into more details here? I might come back to write more,False,self,t5_2rjz2,1370303550.0,s-s3,108,t3_1flagp

**TL;DR: Stay a non-reader

Welcome to the last followup of this season. [Here's the previous one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/uh219/followup_for_nonreaders_blackwater_update/) I'll probably add missing followups for season 1 or so on a weekly basis if I have some spare time. The wait is gonna get this subreddit bonkers.


**Shit Hits The Floor**

&gt; ""Just like your mother did at your age... I can see so much of her in you... She was like a sister to me...""
&gt;  - Littlefinger

It was impossible to top ""Blackwater"". Not this season. After shit hit the fan last week

* Harrenhal is a cursed

* Following my last post: Tyrells are the largest military force in Westeros. Having them on their side and Baratheons of Storm's End defeated

* All Stannis's men who got caught could redeem themselves by swearing fealty to Joffrey. Those who refused were killed. We missed a significant scene where Joffrey's arm gets cut by the Iron Throne. One of Stannis's bannermen shouts ""Even the throne rejects him!"". That would've been powerful.

* In the books Bronn wasn't the captain of the gold cloaks

**Road Trippin'**

&gt; ""Wait... I (do) know you""
&gt;  - Skyrim reference for those who get it ;)

* Riverrun appears in book 2

* The reverse happened to Brienne&amp;Jamie road trip - it's from ASOS. Looks like it's gonna get prolonged. Good for us.

* Brienne's virginity has been a topic for jokes at Renly's camp. The other knights have been treating her like a lady for a while because of a contest to get into her pants.

**Camp Fallen Protagonist**

&gt; ""Walder Frey is a dangerous man""
&gt;  - Mrs. Granger

* With Lannisters controlling Harrenhal

* In the books, she looks quite suspicious (book Jeyne was close to inexistent, she just appeared out of nowhere as Robb's wife).

* Robb married Jayne after taking her maidenhood, so he gains an ally, but a lesser one. I'm having trouble naming TV show Robb anything but ""stupid"".

**I'll Be Back**

&gt; ""Where is your god now?""
&gt;  - Stannis

* Finally we got it: Melisandre sees things in flames. That's how she saw Matthos's death coming (""death by fire is the purest death""). She's a *shadowbinder of Asshai*

* Notice how Melisandre doesn't fight Stannnis choking her. She's completely devoted to Stannis just like Davos.

* Also notice how the only person other than shadowbinders capable of seeing the future is Bran (dreams before Ned died and Theon attacked). Either connection or opposition

* Melisandre's preaching involve two gods, red god of fire, the other one being The Great Other, god of ice and death. Ice and death... reminds you of something? Yeah, that's horrible, but Melisandre can be kind of ""good guy""...

* I mentioned that in ACOK Melisandre wants to burn Edric Storm, really afraid the writers might replace him with Stannis's daughter, Shireen. That would suck.

**Euro 2012**

&gt; ""WHOEVER KILLS THAT FUCKING HORNBLOWER WILL STAND IN BRONZE ON THE SHORES OF PYKE""
&gt;  - Theon

* Fun fact: vuvuzelas are actually forbidden to bring to public events during European Football Championship 2012 in Poland. Thank God. Just watching the games during the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 did some serious damage to my ears. I couldn't imagine those things on my streets.

* What happened to Theon was pretty much clear: his people left him for Ramsay Snow

* Who burnt Winterfell then? Ramsay Snow

**There Are My Dragons!**

&gt; ""Dracarys""
&gt;  - Daenerys

* What was changed? Everything. Not a single vision from the book made it to the show.

* Unfortunately

* What have we seen

* Pyat Pree confirmed for watchers what readers already knew: magic grows strogner with dragons.

**Crossroads**

&gt; ""Valar morghulis""
&gt;  - Jaqen

* Faceless Men has been mentioned many time throughout season 1. Doreah tells about one of them to Viserys

* In the books Tyrion wonders if he could hire one of them to kill Cersei

* ""Valar morghulis"" means [not sure which book it gets explained in](/b ""All men must die""). There are some crazy conspiracy theories linking Faceless Men to the [You wouldn't have guessed](/g ""White Walkers (told you

* Another crazy tinfoil hat theory is that Jaqen H'gar was Syrio Forel and that's how he got into King's Landing dungeons. I think Jaqen denied being Syrio by saying that Faceless Men are entirely different than ""dancing masters"" and I'm glad we got some evidence pointing in any direction.

* Jaqen is not a master assassin - he's a grandmaster assassin

**Snape Kills Dumbledore**

&gt; ""Was that your whore mother?""
&gt;  - Qhorin Halfhand

* To set things clear: Qhorin *wanted* Jon to kill him

* Qhorin's last word is ""sharp..."". In the books

* Ghost is around

* Wilding army is said to consist of mammoths and giants. Now let's pray for increased budget for next seasons...

**It's Called Iceland For A Reason**

&gt; ""Three blasts. RUN!""
&gt;  - Dolorous Edd

* In the books (I hate having to start with this) this scene happens in the night and the area around the Fist of the First Men is forested. In my opinion it would be much more frightening

* [White Walkers (AKA the Others) are not Wights (blue-eyed ""zombies"")](http://imgur.com/a/ziRiH).

* We know Wights are vulnerable to fire. We have no evidence that White Walkers are killable by any means. Of course there are many things that haven't been tried yet.

I've compiled a good sized list of some of my favorite shots that do a lot in terms of foreshadowing, etc.  I'd bet most of these are intentional, but I admit that some of them are probably film school bullshit.  As the saying goes, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  But sometimes a cigar is also a penis.  So if that sort of thing interests you, read on.  If not, turn back now!  
  
Also
  
**Illustrating the Scene**  
  
-One of my favorite visual storytelling techniques is simply illustrating what is happening in the scene with composition, etc.  Probably the most popular example of this is [Ned's choice](http://i.imgur.com/lxOhObF.png) in the pilot episode.  Simple scene composition illustrates the choice he must make between family on the left and duty/honor on the right.  It's also a good reflection of Ned's character.  *(See Below: Illustrating Character)*  
  
-This almost exact same shot is used to illustrate [Theon's Choice](http://i.imgur.com/h3g2kPZ.png) as well.  The quill on his right
  
-Or you can look at what the character is doing in the scene, planting the seeds of revenge in Arya's mind and giving her the idea of saying her ""prayers"" where she recites the names of those she's going to kill.  So how do her actions reflect what's happening here?  She's cleaning Needle.  I also find it interesting that her companions are shown sleeping behind her, almost resembling corpses.  
  
-In an early Daenerys scene, saying they're *his* people.  Then they cut to [this shot of the khalasar.](http://i.imgur.com/RUHoe0V.png)  Dany's right amongst the group, and Viserys is so far out front by himself it's almost hard to notice him.  So who's people are they again?  
  
**Illustrating Similarities**  
  
-Sometimes two scenes can be shot the same way or include similar happenings in order to relate them to each other
  
-[Catelyn protecting her sons.](http://i.imgur.com/5kklh0H.jpg)  
  
-[Sansa's doll in Season 1 vs. Season 2](http://i.imgur.com/uA1pJZr.png)  
  
-And here's a callback to events that happened before the show's timeline.  [Ned and Jaime in the throne room.](http://i.imgur.com/f6Me4ID.png)  What do they talk about in this scene?  Jaime killing King Aerys.
  
**Foreshadowing**  
  
-Probably the most obvious and well-known foreshadowing is the [dead direwolf](http://i.imgur.com/0EGya7d.png) and [stag](http://i.imgur.com/uXe2tBz.png) in the pilot.  
  
-Another one that pops up often is [Tywin flaying a stag](http://i.imgur.com/abv2y8i.png) in the same episode that King Robert dies.  
  
-But sometimes it's more subtle.  Right before Lord Commander Mormont eats it
  
-I've listed two more at the bottom of the post for spoiler purposes.
  
-Sometimes it's not direct foreshadowing
  
-Or [red wine spilling](http://i.imgur.com/eoiehXj.png) moments before the Red Wedding.  Or another Red Wedding one
  
**Illustrating Character**  
  
-Foreshadowing is fun and all
  
-Without ever being told
  
-And again, [so was his wolf.](http://i.imgur.com/JBXw7wK.png)  
  
-Reflections are used a few times.  At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, how others see him, and how Sansa sees him.  
  
-Speaking of Sansa, and only a portion of her face is clear.  She's spent so long pretending to be a Lannister she can barely see her old self.  A season later, while getting fitted for her wedding dress for her marriage to Loras (or so she thinks) she looks at her reflection again.  The mirror is still dirty, but [she can see herself much clearer now.](http://i.imgur.com/bYn9Flj.png)  
  
-[When Stannis visits Davos in jail, which brings me to...  
  
**Character Relationships**  
  
-The way characters are arranged in a scene can say a lot about their relationships.  Davos quite often represents Stannis's conscience.  He's usually close by, Stannis facing away from him and [toward Melisandre.](http://i.imgur.com/RdFuv3t.png)  What's that say about where Stannis is at as a character?  Compare it to one of the [first scenes with the three of them.](http://i.imgur.com/H34ODZS.png)
  
-One of my favorites, but Jaime grabs her hand and stops her.  And for a moment, [they sit holding hands.](http://i.imgur.com/IdQIKSX.png)  They are growing more fond of each other.  
  
-Here's a simple one.  Varys and Littlefinger
  
-Another simple
  
-Here's more of an artsy one.  [Tyrion watches his new wife undress.](http://i.imgur.com/HbTwCuC.png)  Not the most intimate wedding night.  
  
-This one got a lot of upvotes recently
  
-Here's a good illustration of [Jorah being in the friendzone.](http://i.imgur.com/OsON3dk.png)  
  
**tl;dr** A bunch of over analyzing.  
  
There's way more than the ones I posted
