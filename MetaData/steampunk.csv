For many months I have been frequenting this delightful sub, to instigate any of these discussions. Rarely did I find a noteworthy costume or trinket deserving of its own thread, until I stumbled upon an 18 Barreled Revolver found in r/pics. 'AHA' I thought, 'This is just the ticket to captivate those delightful folk over in r/Steampunk' so I ctrl-c'ed the link and ran to this sub like a school boy to the sweet shop with a shiny new shilling. To my delight you all took the picture to your bosoms and showed your enjoyment with heaping's of karma, the comments were humourous and informative and I reveled in conversing with you all. However, my lowly picture soon turned into a questionable game of one-upmanship. Unimpressed were those with access to images of larger, more extraordinary firearms. '18 barrels? pah' I read. ''only one gun? here's a collection!' I saw. This sub rapidly began the slide into r/extraordinarypistols. Gone were the fancy hats and tesla-powered Difference Engines! Gone were the beautiful lady mechanics and the charming gentlemen rogues. So please, if I may be so bold

Thankyou
