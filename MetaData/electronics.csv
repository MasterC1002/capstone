* I'm assuming that this is a hobby thing
* I'm gonna post the resultant schematic and PCB on the internets/Reddit as public property (or [CC](http://creativecommons.org/) or whatever)
* If this is a school project
* I'll probably add more stuff if I or anyone else can think of relevant stuff to add

Oh I should probably include something about how I'm not a total crackpot and I am vaguely qualified to do something like this.

* I am a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Technology program at Purdue University.
* I am proficient at [PCB Artist](http://www.4pcb.com/free-pcb-layout-software/) and [EAGLE CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/)
* I have made my own 1 sided PCB's at home using [this process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWnfnt2rNO0)
* I have ordered PCB's from [Advanced Circuits](http://www.4pcb.com/)
* [Here is a gallery of my PCBs](http://imgur.com/a/r1TK1#0)

In this episode Shahriar demos the world’s fastest oscilloscope! The Agilent DSA-X 96204Q offers 160GS/s of conversion rate  with a bandwidth of 62GHz on two dedicated ‘RealEdge’ channels. It can also provide 80GS/s conversion rate and 33GHz of bandwidth on four simultaneous channels. The unit demoed in this video is equipped with all available options and is valued at over 0.5 million US dollars. The block diagram of various sub-systems of the oscilloscope are presented and the principle operation of the instrument is explained. A 56Gb/s PRBS-15 signal is applied to the scope from a Centellax 2G2P5A (now Agilent N4975A) and the resulting data pattern is examined in real-time. Various scope functions are also presented as well as the capability to observer bit failures at baud-rate using this instrument.

This chip (NXP LPC1114/102) was [mentioned](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/03/13/32-bit-meet-dip-arm-cortex-m0-in-dip-packages/) on the Adafruit blog a few months ago but I haven't seen much said about it since then so here is my first impression. I come from working with AVR and Arduino stuff and I didn't find this chip hard to get working at all. The built-in bootloader makes loading your programs easy; all you need is two wires for a serial connection and some free software.

* [LPCxpresso](http://lpcxpresso.code-red-tech.com/LPCXpresso/) IDE (limited to 128K flash) based on Eclipse
* [Flashmagic](http://www.flashmagictool.com/) (Win/Mac only) to load your .hex files to the board. Its sort of like a GUI avrdude. EDIT: Linux users can use [lpc21isp](https://github.com/Zuph/lpc21isp) 

Note: to use Flashmagic with LPCxpresso you need to change the build to output .hex files instead of only .axf files.

* http://www.microbuilder.eu/blog/09-12-16/Building_Intel_Hex_Files_with_LPCXpresso.aspx

Details

* 32 bit Cortex-M0 48Mhz
* 32 kB flash - 4 kB sram
* 1 UART, 6 ADC, 22 GPIO
* [User Manual](http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10398.pdf)
* [Datasheet](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/LPC111X.pdf)

Example Code (drivers

* [http://ics.nxp.com/support/lpcxpresso/](http://ics.nxp.com/support/lpcxpresso/)
* [https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC1114CodeBase](https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC1114CodeBase)


Pros

* [Cheaper](http://www.findchips.com/avail?part=LPC1114FN28%2F102) than many midrange 8-bit DIP chips
* $25 [debugger board](http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc1114_xpr.php)
* 50 Mhz with the onboard ~~crystal~~ (EDIT: Internal RC oscillator)

Cons

* not 5V (1.8V to 3.6V)
* Flashmagic not supported on Linux but you may get it to run in WINE. Linux users can use [lpc21isp](https://github.com/Zuph/lpc21isp) and the LPC-Link from the Xpresso devboards.
* Not as power efficient in deep sleep mode as a Picopower AVR (based on datasheets)
* (EDIT) Availability outside the USA is poor at the moment. Shipping is ~$30-$50 from Mouser/Avnet

Enthusiasts have often wished there were more MCUs in DIP format. Some would argue its the reason 8 bit MCUs have had so much staying power

I wanted to share this older vid of where I attempted to make the world's simplest balancing robot that would as easy as possible to duplicate. I thought it would be more appropriate to post here instead of /r/robotics.

[simple analog balancing robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-afnY32RrY)

The little balance bot is based around a 555 timer chip set up as a crude PID (integral isn't actually used in the vid) using LDRs (light dependent resistors) as sensors and a servo modified for continuous rotation.  In the latter part of the vid I show how to make a 2 transistor balancing robot. All parts for this project can be bought at a Radio Shack and a hobby store.

The modulation in to pin 5 of the 555 timer means that I'm frequency modulation the pulse train. Servos can accept a wide range of pulse train frequencies, this frequency modulation doesn't matter. The benefit is that using this technique, it's simple to modulate the pulse width going in to the servo, which is all that matters.

It is much simpler to build the 555 timer version of this robot rather than the 2 transistor version.

A 14 watt compact fluorescent light the is used as a reference off screen.

You can google *modify a servo for continuous rotation* to see how it's done or buy them pre-modified from multiple sources. A lot of people don't realize that a servo modified for continuous rotation is a full proportional bi-directional motor controller.

Flux psychically knows where I want the solder to flow.

sawing solder should be illegal

The datasheet Beta is a lie

resistors are just badly designed capacitors

capacitors are just resistors with some parasitical capacitance

inductors are way too large

The prototype board for the component has the actual values you need for the external components. The datasheet is lying about this.

Oddly enough the only true insulator I have found is the esd bag. You can use them like an oven mitt.

No matter how many layers you have it still won't be enough.

Always pick everything off the same reel.

No parasitical property can be used to your advantage. If it could be someone would have made a dedicate part that already did this.

Your current limiting diode will just be put in backwards.

Would anyone be interested in learning about Electronics visually? With plenty of pictures

For each change in component value I would show an Oscilliscope waveform to help illustrate it. I could make kits available as an experimenters kit where it includes multiple values of components ideally It would be very close to near cost however I have not decided about really selling anything. It would depend on what the users wanted.

I'm really just curious as to what others think

I welcome any feedback anyone may have and I appreciate everyone's time! :)

Bit of background. I am farmer trying simplify a few things in my daily operations using the technology that is available to me. I'm a bit of a nerd and love building stuff weather its out of wood or steel, went from break fix type stuff to server admin. I am also comfortable with basic AC (wired my basement) and DC (installed several car stereos, aux lighting, relay controlled HID lighting, etc). But I am lacking in the more  sophisticated technologies, usually if I cant figure something a quick google search and i'm good. But with electronics its different, you need to know what you're looking for to find information on it. You also need to understand fancy symbols and diagrams and etc. I have no formal training in any of this.

Anyway, 3/4 full, etc). This would be on a 12v system. 
On the same seed drill, just to ensure they are in fact turning. Again 12v system

The last thing I want to do right now is create a monitor light for my cows water trough that tells we when its full of water so I can shut the hose off. Ideally this would be a light that illuminates when the water reaches a certain level. This would be on a 110v system.

Again I am just a dumb farmer so please use laymen terms. Also I am trying to do these projects on a limited budget, but costs more I wouldnt be opposed to going that route. 

I hope my post makes sense and someone is able to help me :) I will likely have more of these types of projects in the future and I hope I can turn to r/electronics when I have questions. I would more then happy to buy anyone who helps a eBeer. Thanks!!!",self,t5_2qhue,1352170470.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/12otts/help_a_dumb_farmer_with_electronics_please/

* [Taped to a wall
* [Taped to a speaker
* [Taped to a speaker

We ended up using the 4g range with 1200Hz sample rate. The model is BMA180

I thought I might append some details as to how it was done. We simply took the signed 16 bit value coming out of the accelerometer and converted it to signed 8 bit. We sent these values down the UART (no message delimiters) through an FTDI where it was captured using miniterm.py and saved to a file. It was as simple as opening the file in Audacity as raw data and playing it back at the appropriate sample rate.

[Link to the album](http://imgur.com/a/7hlI2#0)

**The goal here is simple:**

* Place an LCD screen just in front of the players face
* Motion control which does not rely on camera's and IR to allow the player to actually turn 360 degrees.
* Of course everything (including the video) need to be wireless.
* Usable for other games

So here it is.  I have stripped the main board of a 360 controller, mounted everything in an Airsoft Rifle making the controls as natural as possible, and will be mounting a screen just in front of the users face so that as you aim your field of view moves just as it would if you were aiming a real rifle!

**About the controls:**

I am trying to make them as natural as possible.

Left hand (holding the hand guard)

* Thumb sits on a PSP-style sliding thumb stick allowing moment (simulating input from the left stick on a normal controller)
* Fingers curl naturally around the guard and each rest on tactile buttons for A, and RSB
* Small movement of hand to grenade buttons

Right hand

* Trigger fires
* Magazine release reloads
* Button on pistol grip allows you to simply squeeze for ADS
* Thumb easily reaches the D-Pad replacement which is located where the selector lever normally is

**About the electronics:**

I will not go into too much detail with this post (unless requested), but I might eventually try to add more motion control like actual movement and crouch/jump.  The gyro data is processed with a Adruino Pro Mini and outputted to a series of digital potentiometers.  The D-pad was replaced with a 5 position switch.  The controllers electronics are powered by a 2000mAh LiPo battery so it will have extreme runtime and quick recharge.

**About the display:**

10.1"" HDMI LDC monitor...Very light and power efficient running off a 4600mAh battery at the moment

**Notes about use:**

Given the components involved

**What I have left to work on:**

* Build the physical mount which will hold the screen to the gun...Not difficult but time consuming.
* Streamline the data from the gyros...Right now it 'works' but there is more programming to do to normalize and calibrate the data from the gyros to make it more accurate and reliable...Just a matter of time and math.
* ADS...Some of you may have thought about it already...You aim slower aiming down the sights...I will need to monitor the ADS button with the micro controller and adjust the look speed accordingly...Again not too difficult

Disappointingly, many had poor reviews on Amazon. There is a book, [Practical AVR Microcontrollers
Games, coming out in August 2012 that looks promising.

I've found a handful of helpful websites. For anyone looking for similar resources

So to help anyone else who may also be learning how to program these awesome microcontrollers

* [NewbieHack.com](http://newbiehack.com): This site is absolutely the best source of information I've found so far for programming Atmel microcontrollers. It has an extensive list of written tutorials and accompanying video guides that cover ""Hello, analog-to-digital conversion, building power supply circuits, pulse with modulation, and more. I am in no way affiliated with the authors; I just found them in a Google query; but I have learned more about AVR programming from that site than any other.
* [AVRFreaks.net](http://avrfreaks.net): Probably the most well-known and frequently mentioned AVR resource, and advice from experts in their forum.
* [Extreme Electronics](http://extremeelectronics.co.in/): This site has 50+ AVR tutorials covering a number of topics, TWI, etc. I like it because it has a lot of tutorials showing how to interface AVR microcontrollers with other devices, like sensors, motors, servos, and LCD screens. Though not as well-written or in-depth as NewbieHack.com or AVRFreaks.net
* [Engineers Garage](http://engineersgarage.com): This site has dozens of project examples and tutorials

There are many

Please add the **best AVR resources** you know of, video guides, etc. to help newbies like me learn how to Make with these awesome microcontrollers! Thank you

I recently got my hands on an old Tektronix 2465B Analog Oscilloscope and I wanted to test a square wave with sub-nanosecond rise-time to see how well this old workhorse is doing. This will allow me to test the horizontal and vertical signal paths and see how tired they are after a lifetime of use. My school does not have the equipment to test this
    
I still feel I'm in a giant playground and I have to experiment as much as I can while I have access to all sorts of equipment I don't have at home. As much as I'd like to complement my old oscilloscope with function generators, and SMD rework station, etc etc... I simply won't have the means to do so in the near future. Same goes for costly electronics experiments.     
    
Thanks to a few companies though
    
[Linear Technology](http://www.linear.com) has shipped me 5 different ICs (2 of each one) for me to use in this pulse generator as well as an avalanche pulse generator they have in another application note. Some of these are $5-10 a piece when ordered from Digikey so the cost of the project becomes non-trivial for students such as myself. [Microchip](http://www.microchip.com) is another great company which mailed me samples. I received 3 different microcontrollers

This is my entry for the 555 design contest. I decided to make an education video so that people learning electronics can also learn robotics. A lot of this work stems from my research in to analog biomorphic robotic systems. One can see a provisional application (the patent was never filed so this is an open source concept (unless memresistors are used) titled a [Synthetic Nervous System for Robotics](http://www.google.com/patents?id=Y0WjAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

This is really just the tip of the iceberg and I'll be making some more videos related to simple adaptive analog motor control

This video articulate some of the core concepts of analog robotics:

Here's a list of schematics. If you build the basic 555 servo controller then you shouldn't need to use an oscilloscope. Don't substitute parts unless you do have an oscilloscope.

When I connect the pump (the pump pumps water), sometimes fluctuating back and forth between them. This happens on all ranges (up to 200VDC), and even more mysteriously, it happens with *all* the digital multimeters I tried.  There is no significant measurable AC voltage.

I figured some funny business must have been happening with the pump (due to inductance)

In other words

What's going on?

* Arduino manages fading the lights evenly between colors - sends commands to the 6 control boards via I2C
* ATTINY85 on control board recieves I2C commands and generates a PWM signal to dim the LEDs
* ATTINY85 also calibrates the requested brightness with the CIE human lightness response curve (the eye is non-linear) 

Power Circuitry

* AC input converted to 36V DC for the LEDs and 5V DC for the arduino
* LEDs driven by 3 channel LT3496 in buck topology

I'm interested in MCU/CPU history and was studying the Fairchild F8 just recently so I thought it would be interesting to point out this one.

F8 was introduced in 1975, one of the first microcontrollers.

But even before this, made in 1980. Perhaps the most important feature at the time was integrating serial port (UART) module as well as 16-bit timers. All these were ROM or EPROM, only decade later reprogrammable Flash variants became appearing.

To this day there are still many chips based on 8051 core and modern microcontrollers which are pin compatible with the original (for example the AVR based ATmega8515). It all started with the Fairchild F8

I just stumbled onto this article. It made me realize what a n00b I am in hardware land and also how wide open the possibilities are if I'm willing to put in the effort to learn (and never stop). Made me realize that there's soooo much I don't know about electronics that I don't even have a clue as to how much I don't know.

So that post was definitely an eye-opener and in some ways a bit disappointing, it is always nice to be introduced to reality, however harsh it might be. Reading the post made me realize that there's a lot to learn, and that the only way to go is up (i.e. towards more success with hardware hacking). It was also very encouraging, because it made me realize that if I can acquire the requisite knowledge, then there is virtually no limit to what I can make.

Where should I go from here? What is the best path to the knowledge I need to advance?

I'm a software engineer with a great interest in electronics. I don't intend to do anything with it professionally, and have a neat lighting solution with WS2801 based LED-strips. All of this just with my trusty Arduino, (cheap-)multimeter, and soldering iron.

Usually I get by with loads of debugging, google for an arduino lib, and it should get you started :)). However, often I feel like things would be so much easier if I would just be able to take a look at the signals I'm generating, or take a look at the signals something else is putting out.

Seeing as I intend to upgrade my LED-strips to different chips that use a single wire protocol (which will be a lot more difficult to get right than a simple 2-wire SPI protocol)

I've spotted the following that seem to be affordable on a hobby budget

* BusPirate like device
* Saleae Logic
* Saleae Logic 16
* Open Workbench Logic Sniffer
* DSO Nano v2

The Bus Pirate seems like a bad choice, although possible, it's not meant to be used as a logic analyzer.

The Saleae Logic (16) seems to be used all over the place, i'm not sure if it'll be worth the money. Apart from that I'm afraid that if I go with the normal version, I'll regret it in the future when I wish I'd gotten the Logic 16 (which is even more expensive!)

The Open Workbench Logic Sniffer is fully open-source, it appears that the recording length is limited by it's internal memory, whereas (for example) the Saleae Logic will be able to ""stream"" it live to the PC and are as such unlimited. I don't think I'll ever need to record something for more than a few seconds, but I can't find out how much space is on the device.

The DSO Nano v2 looks nice, so no debugging of multi-wire protocols, and in general it feels more like a gimmick than an actual tool.

I believe my best bet would be either a Saleae Logic or the Open Workbench Logic Sniffer. I'm tempted to buy the latter

Myself and a group of other advanced (multi-year) students were building a 6' tesla coil for a local community college. I was never too great with the math aspect of these coils

After spending a crazy amount of time building the stand, we fired it up.

It fired up well

The entire class stopped working on their projects to see two students and their teacher running away cursing; one student and the teacher grabbing their leg

The trigger coil for Xenon flash tubes!              
http://www.xenonflashtubes.com/tc-36.html

That example has 190 Volts upped to 6

I've got the parts

The charge circuit connects to the 'cap via a diode to produce the DC it needs right? Otherwise the cap would be getting the AC from the oscillator direct

So, I should be getting a ~300 volt AC wave wiggling the magnetic filed in the trigger transformer, and I should see a nice healthy ~6000 to ~12000 volt potential on the second winding?

I can't find a site that lets me dial in voltage, and 30% humidity.... but I'm hoping for a few millimeters?

Does anyone have any thoughts on this high-voltage generator? Problems I may have? Should I leave the large 'cap connected

All these things I don't know!

Thanks!

(Also pictures if I get a fuzzy spark from it!)
