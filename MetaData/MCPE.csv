Happy holiday season. I hope everyone is just fine and dandy. (If you could just take a sec to upvote this so it'll be read, thank you.)

You guys don't see me around here much, bad reporting and removal, and how you guys can help.

**The first major problem we're having are unrelated posts.** Some of you may forget that even though this is an awesome, this may not be what you want to hear, but it needs to be said. No more IRL photos, iPhone backgrounds, or anything of the sort. You can feel free to share your creations of that sort in [the regular minecraft subreddit](/r/minecraft) or through personal PMs. Yes, they are fun, and yes, but this subreddit simply isn't for it. And I feel some of you may have forgotten that.

**The second thing I'd like to talk about is some problems with removal, iphone backgrounds not pertaining to MCPE, stuff that doesn't contribute). **Don't** downvote posts you don't agree with, but that do follow the posting guide. Things like calls to action like this one, or helpful guides on farms that *you* may have seen. Don't write things off as a repost, because we're getting new people every day. They may not have seen it. Guys, a background picture of chickens shouldn't be on the front page

**The last thing is what you can do about it.** Basically, report. Often we miss it. Also, feel free to message us, the mods, at any time. Often we can do something about it.

So yup

See ya'll later.

1. Get iExplorer from here: http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/
2. Get MCPEedit from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1205921-pocket-edition-inventory-editor-for-desktop-computers-macwin/
2b. Update Java.  You can maybe skip this if you're up-to-date and/or just lazy
3. Connect your device to your computer via USB and open up iExplorer.  Look in Apps/MinecraftPE/Documents/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds and you should see a folder for each world you have.  Copy these folders to your computer (make a MCPE Backup folder on your desktop or something - leave these files alone in case you mess something up and need to restore a backup
4. Open MCPEedit.  Go to the file menu and you'll see you can open level, though if you want you can adjust your health or location.  Chunk files are only really worth opening if you want to generate a map of your world or move the player location (or mess with it with MCedit or WorldPainter or whatever, but I won't be covering that).  The level file has the good stuff - open that up and you can mess with your inventory, time of day, game mode, and view the seed that generated your world.  I'm guessing 90% of what people will want to do is switch between survival and creative mode and edit their inventories.
5. Edit the file to your heart's content, though that can be changed.  Use iExplorer to replace the old file on your device with the new one you edited with MCPEedit.

A couple of notes: the inventory editor cannot add items, or something else easily obtainable.  Make sure these are in the first few slots of your inventory (no blank spots before them).  Also, the amount and damage numbers don't seem to make any sense, so I leave them alone and just change the block/item type.  MCPEedit also doesn't support some recent items - for instance, it can't figure out what melons are, and you can't turn your items into Glowstone blocks, only Glowstone Dust (so just get dust and assemble the stones in-game).  You can also give yourself stacks of tools, I always quit to title, so the world isn't loaded when you're trying to replace the files.

Also note that you can't actually mess with the .app package via iExplorer

Anyway.  Hope this is at least news to someone,,False,self,t5_2tu23,1361408828.0,,True

* **Mob Grinders** - There are many different versions of mob grinders. [Here's a great video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kclXjsNDzeY) for a very effective model using a body of water to direct the mobs to a drop hole in the middle of the mob spawning room. (very low light levels are key for spawning hostile mobs.) [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/mEvd2) an album of my version of this method.

* **Sugarcane farming** - [Sugarcane]( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Sugar_Cane) can be planted on [sand, you can remove the water next to the sugarcane. When the sugarcane is supposed to grow, it will instead break apart, allowing [(semi-) automated sugarcane farms.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWpt8do238).

* **Mushroom farming** - Mushrooms can grow on almost [every block]( http://i.imgur.com/Z59IgxU.png)

* **Nether Reactor** - Because of some stability issues, what it does, and what you get from it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO3nG4tJnS4) Prior to 0.6.0, The Nether Spire was made of obsidian. After this update the obsidian was replaced with netherack.

* **Shearing sheep and regrowing wool** - Shearing a sheep will produce 1-3 wool blocks. Hold down on the sheep while you have the shears on your main inventory highlighted to shave the wool. After shearing


* **How to back up your worlds iOS/Android** -

**Android** - Get the app ‘PocketInvEditor’

**iOS** - Get iExplorer on your computer, and drag it into a folder from your library, to your desktop, creating a backup folder. Then, if you wish to send it to someone via email or through a file-sharing site, compress (zip) the folder and upload it to a file sharing website such as www.dropbox.com.

* **How to get or create a custom skin** - http://www.minecraftskins.com/ is a great place to find a new skin or create your own. 

* **Installing mods/skins/maps/texture packs** - 

**Android** – Download the app ‘UTK’ (UltimateToolKit) and download the desired mods/skins/maps/texture packs that you would like. Get out of UTK and open the app ‘PocketTool’ and follow the step by step instructions to install the downloads you have on your device. (if you are still having problems try watching [this tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2grWwpKUZqQ) that I found online.

**iOS** - At this time installing these may require a [Jailbreak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking). Please make sure you fully understand what a Jailbreak is before you do it. After you have Jailbroken your iDevice

1) Backup your worlds using Ifile. [Video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vgzdA1PNeE) 

2) Decrypt MCPE. [Video tutorial]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj0tg9Zlris) 

3) Get MCPE patch. [Add this source in cydia](http://cydia.myrepospace.com/siris/) 

4) Copy-paste the link for the mod you want from [here.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1394066-ios-mods/) 

5) Add mod to MCPE patch

6) Open MCPE and BOOM! You have your mod! 


**Check out [this thread](http://redd.it/18wt8w) from /u/SoySauceSyringe on what you can edit without Jailbreaking your iDevice.** (This method requires iExplorer and MCPEedit on a computer.)

* **Branch mining** - If you’re in need of some diamonds, make a little base with chests and furnaces, and start mining 2x1 holes horizontally, [Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/L6UUzAM.png) 

* **Animal/Mob regeneration/degeneration**- I put [this guy](http://www.imgur.com/TR9l2q6.png) in here and walked away..I counted right about 100 blocks and came back to [this.](http://www.imgur.com/xjpXrk3.png) So

* **How to create an album or upload photos on imgur** - 

**Android**: Download the app called [Imgur for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitchbarry.imgur&amp;hl=nl) from the Play Store. Some users are able to create albums using your mobile browser

**iOS**: iOS doesn’t have an app which is capable of making albums at this time. [ImgurApp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgurapp/id501416446?mt=8) will allow you to upload single pictures. Some users are able to create albums using your mobile browser

""As of 0.6.0 the sky in Pocket Edition only has clouds and is a lush blue color. The sun

**Yay!**

""Online (LAN) mode only allows 5 players to be on a single server.""

**Woah. Didn't know that.**

The world size is 256x256 blocks.

**Nice little tidbid for newcomers.**

The Nether is not present

**This could mean we'll get an *actually* Nether.**

*Helpful tips for newcomers.*

* Make sure your battery is charged

* Get used to the controls before playing on servers (it is easy to mine the block under a torch by mistake).

* Tap and hold an item in the hotbar to drop it.

* Know the difference between Hostile and non-hostile mobs.

* Know how to craft and cook

The terrain.png file in the APK file found on Android devices is nearly identical to that in the PC version, End Portal).

**WOAH! The definitely gives some hints to some awesome stuff to be added in the future. (Lucky Android users!)**

If you have any kind of modifier or command to give yourself any item in the Minecraft entity folder (e.g. iron door) the background of the non-existing entity will appear red meaning it does not exist or was never meant to.

**That makes sense now.**

^This ^is ^an ^prediction ^by ^me

**The Indev wall (the invisible bedrock at the edges of worlds) is INFINITE! Meaning if you go up there and keeping walking, then go in the direction *away* from the world! It's infinite!** *Whew...*

Baby animals are in Pocket Edition

**Yet... ;)**

Skeletons are significantly less accurate in Pocket Edition than PC or Xbox

**This BETTER not be fixed. For those who haven't played the PC version

In PE Lite

Tools last forever.

You have indefinite amounts of anything excluding raw materials.

**So?**

[Here is a link to Upcoming features.](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pocket_Edition_upcoming_features)

**Enderman**: Johan mentioned in the Live Stream Minecraft MCO Beta that Enderman will be added soon.

**Enchanting**: Johan said in the Live Stream Minecraft MCO Beta ""I think we will get that in the future""

**Breeding**: Johan answered a question that Breeding will be added in a no-distant future (possibly this year)

**Redstone**: At the Minecraft Pocket Edition panel at MineCon 2012

**Foods**: Johan mentioned on the Live Stream ""Minecraft Pocket Edition MCO Beta"" that in a future it will be added more foods. For 0.6.2 the Cake recipe will be added

**Sky Additions**: Jbernhardsson tweeted that the changes to the sky in 0.6.0 were only the first iteration

**Caves**: Jeb stated that caves may be available as an option the user can toggle in later updates.

**Skins**: Jbernhardsson tweeted

**In-Game music**: Johan (Livestream) answered in a question that In-Game Music will be added for the next 4-5 updates more.

These are all the things I found interesting. Don't tell me ""oh I could've just gone to the wiki and checked this out myself."" No. Shut up. This shows off some cool facts and helpful tips. Thanks for reading.

My time has passed! Someday, and be amazed again at how far we have come. I truly love you guys, but it's like the age old quote:

*""If you love it, it never was.""*

I let the community go

If I could have one last wish

To all the friends I made here: I'll never forget you. I'm not going to do anything drastic like delete my account. I may not sign on that often

Maybe in the summer I can return for a longer period of time. If I can find it within me

There's more words than I can possibly fit in here. All I can say is

I actually love you guys. Purely platonic

1369009134.0,1envj1,"Everything you need to know about MCPE, MCPE's modding, texture installing, and etc.",sbd01,5, before I start I'd like to say that this is my version of the FAQ (all rewritten). I don't want you guys to think this is a fake copy; I just feel like we need to update a bunch of stuff on it.***

**You can find the original FAQ [here

##**Mob Traps/Grinders and related builds**

Many people ask how to make a mob grinder
**A good thing to do is to build your mob grinder in a large body of water, [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYNLMtuccNo)**

You can also build [BananaPotion](http://www.reddit.com/user/BananaPotion)'s [mob sorter idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/1awzf3/mob_sorter_in_mcpe/) It sorts your mobs nice and neat. Also

##**Mushroom Farms**

Mushrooms will grow onto other blocks, even if it is lit. [It happened to me.](http://i.imgur.com/vQpoIjq.png) No, I did not place that mushroom in the light.
Mushroom farms can basically be anywhere as long as that area is dark.

##**Sugar Cane**

Sugar cane (commonly called bamboo, or grass blocks that are right next to water. It will eventually grow, up to three blocks above ground. Sugar cane farms cane be made by efficiently removing the water block that sugar cane requires. [Here is a good video example of a sugar cane farm.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWpt8do238) 

##**The Nether Reactor**

The Nether Reactor is the MCPE version of the Nether dimension that is present on Minecraft PC. It is made from four gold blocks

##**Animal farms and Sheep**

On the PC Minecraft, there is nothing you can do with animals except kill them, or shear them, if they are sheep. Sheep can be sheared by crafting shears (two iron), and when the player presses and holds down on the screen on a sheep when carrying shears, the sheep will become sheared, and drop 1 to 3 wool blocks. Sheep cannot be sheared any other way, converting it into a dirt block. Sheep can also be dyed different colors by using the normal Minecraft dyes. The dyes can be applied to them by pressing and holding on a sheep while carrying a dye. When dyed sheep are sheared

It is much easier to create farms when the world is freshly made, or pond. 

[How to collect animals.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os43UGz19QU)

##**Mob spawnage/despawnage**

Hostile mobs, Spiders, Zombie Pigmen, and Skeletons will despawn when the player is about 100 blocks away. Animals, such as Pigs, Chickens, Cows, will not despawn. The animals not caught in pens or farms will usually end up in water so your best option

##**Mining**

Digging down to bedrock level

You could also attempt [strip mining

If you like digging large holes down to bedrock level

###**Mods


##**Backing up Android MCPE worlds

The app [PocketInvEditor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.pocketinveditor&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) can be used to backup Android maps. Simply open up the application

Another method for backup is the application [Ultimate Toolkit for MCPE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.chrismcmine.mcpemods&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd), and from there, you can backup all your maps, delete all backups, or choose individual maps to backup and restore.

To install mods on BlockLauncher

You can also apply textures by using the Use Texture Pack option in the Options menu for BlockLauncher

##**Backing up iOS MCPE worlds**

Download [iExplorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/) or [iFunBox](http://www.i-funbox.com/) and navigate to something like this: &gt;Applications&gt;Minecraft PE&gt;Documents&gt;com.mojang&gt;minecraftWorlds. Then you can simply copy the worlds you wish onto your computer, or Box, or other online file storage systems. 

##**Skins**

You can get great skins on [The Skindex](http://www.minecraftskins.com/)

 * **Android:** *No root:* Download the application [BlockLauncher Pro.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.mcpelauncher.pro) It costs $1.71 USD

Also

* **iOS** *Jailbreak required* Admittedly

Backup your worlds using iFile or iFunBox.

Decrypt MCPE (this is mandatory for mods

Get [MCPE Patcher.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1391739-ios-mcpe-patcher/)

Paste in the link for the download of an iOS mod/skin into the application.

Add the mod to the MCPE patch

Open Minecraft Pocket Edition.

###**Uploading images for Reddit**

* **Android:** Download [Imgur for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitchbarry.imgur&amp;hl=nl) from the Play Store. From there, though.

* **iOS:** iOS has several applications, like [this one.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgurapp/id501416446?mt=8) However, that application is not capable of creating Albums. Also, you can use [Imgupr.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgupr-photo-uploader-for/id498636755?mt=8)

* **Paralyzed Way** A while back

1362426862.0,19nmrp,The Apple Challenge! ,ParalyzedFire,53,13,50,"*For all you people who want to do something difficult or just for the hell of it!*

The Apple Challenge is a challenge that I made up. It's basically you have to survive in a world without touching most of the precious items. 

**RULES**

1)Can only eat apples

2)Every single tool that you use most involve a tree (That means you can't make anything else.)

3)Cobble is allowed

4) HAVE to have a tree and wheat farm. (Meaning no meat.)

5) Obviously no nether reactors

6) House must be underwater! (Making it difficult ;) This means that you have to find a way to make a farm underwater. Also you have to manage to make a waterfall decoration in their house!

7) Only animal you can kill is sheep! (Wool purposes)

8) I actually decided to allow iron (**SOLELY FOR ARMOR PURPOSES THOUGH**)

9)Hard part: The final part of this challenge is that you have to be one layer above bedrock and completely mine all of it. From one side of the world to all the others. &gt;:D

10) You can have someone help you

That is all the rules and I am still unsure whether or not to put a deadline. I'm going to participate as well. So yeah. Give it a shot guys!

**TL;DR** Go back and read the rules.

I'm no moderator

Have fun.

**BIG EDIT** :p You guys have a deadline now! You have until (3/12/13) 8 days! If you want you can title it [AC]",self,t5_2tu23,1362455128.0,,ent-flame,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/19nmrp/the_apple_challenge/

For those worrying about the activity of mods

Me and SEA_TURTLES_BITCH will be taking lead and selecting a few of you that we've deemed mod quality and conducting interviews over a private IRC chat. If you don't get messaged by us

We're still deciding what to do with MCPE_Master_Builder. I've asked him to at the very least write an apology.

Please, we do care, and we don't think we're better than you.

**1.** Review times for the iOS app store average to about 6 days. Source: [Shiny Development Review Times](http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com)

**2.** Android users needing to wait is primarily a matter of fairness. When Android users didn't have to wait, it would be the same, but reversed.

**3.** Apps need to be reviewed to ensure they will run. Believe it or not, in the past, needed to resubmit Minecraft for review, therefor the 6 day estimate is relying on a successful submission.

Redstone on the PC, then the repeater as the basics. More recently you have things like comparators for more advanced Redstone-based machines. If you've played PC, you probably know how bad Redstone can make the game lag. When I have Redstone lamps flashing from a Redstone blinker, it can easily turn my game from a smooth 50 FPS to 16 FPS.

Now, HTC One, etc), a majority of MCPE users don't. They have the older phones that came cheap or even free on their service plan (e.g. - iPhone 3GS, Droid 2, etc), the ones that can barely manage short rendering distance. Imagine trying to make Redstone machines on those. *shudder*

While the higher-end devices could most likely pull of basic, all of them have to have it. Let's say Mojang did add in support for Redstone, can you guess what would happen? Most likely a flood of 1-star reviews saying Minecraft is terrible/laggy/crap, which would bring down the score of the app driving away new buyers.

So more than likely, and there's already too many games with it (Dead Trigger I'm looking at you).",,False,self,t5_2tu23,False,hostile-skeleton,

2. The WBC, so there you go.

3. Update info. I understand that you guys are wanting the community to know about new updates and such

4. Updates for a build. There has been so many times when a user has 5-10 updates for a build. I think I'm speaking for everyone when I say WE DON'T CARE. We don't need to know when you found diamonds when building something

This is just by 2 cents on the subreddit. I want this subreddit to be fun and entertaining

Thanks
