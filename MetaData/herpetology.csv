Story for reads!:  One hot day I was walking down my driveway, the moment I put my bare foot down I felt a sharp pain on the top of my foot.  I looked down to see that I'm stepping right on top of a big snake biting the top of my foot!  I didn't know what kind of snake it was, but at this point I guess it didn't matter since it had already bitten me; I reached down, grabbed it right behind the head (this was fairly easy since it had locked itself onto my skin) and a couple coils then ran home to grab a container.  I put her in one with a bit of dog bedding and let her sit for a few minutes so she could calm down and catcher her breath whilst I went and did a little bit of research to figure out what kind of snake it was.  I almost knew for certain it wasn't poisonous because of the area I lived in and it did not look like a cottonmouth.  I still can't find anything that looks exactly like her, but I was for certain that it was a Northern Water Snake.  Then I came back, decided she was harmless, and also noticed she was about to pop out of her old shed, nearly tagged me a couple times.  But eventually she relaxed and allowed me to gently help her shed; she even let me take the skin off of her head without flinching more than once!  After all the skin came off, feeling like I made up for stepping on her.

Even though I have caught many a snakes before and after this time

Anyway, but sure enough, [here he is](http://i.imgur.com/GGceu.jpg).  He's a juvenile, only about 10 inches nose-to-tail.

I collected him and put him in a 10-gallon terrarium with a 60-watt bulb for light and newspaper substrate.  I've got some kale, and tomato out for food.  And, of course, water.  (I know that enclosure is too small for him, but I'm not keeping him and it's better than leaving him outdoors to fend for himself.)

He is a little skittish, he's quite docile.  Hasn't shown any aggression at all.

I don't plan on keeping him

So, his original home, though I am suspicious of any home that would let a young iguana get away and not report it anywhere.

Any Redditors in Connecticut/New York who can offer him a temporary (or permanent) residence?  Any suggested reptile rescues in this area (I know the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport does an exotic animal rescue program

Thanks for the advice.

I received messages from several fellow herpers thanking me

Herpetology is a field of science. So why is r/herpetology filled with mostly hobbyist posts? Especially considering that keepers have their own subreddit at r/herpetoculture.

r/ornithology isn’t filled with “look at my designer hatchling posts

I have virtually zero interest herpetoloculture, so why do they need to post here as well? I’m getting the impression that the constant pet posts are warding off a lot of would-be contributors. I know that many (but definitely not all) herpetologists make an effort avoid keepers.

What do my fellow herpers think of making r/herpetology the dedicated SCIENCE based subreddit that it deserves to be

I don’t think what I’m suggesting is unreasonable.

If it’s an issue of not having the mods/time to keep it clean

If we could get some input from the mods as well that would be awesome!

Also is there any interest in a dedicated field herping subreddit

If you disagree

EDIT:

Here's the general consensus I'm seeing:

1) Ban herptoculture posts but provide links to r/reptiles r/snakes r/herpetoculture so that the keepers can find what they are looking for.

2) Allow field-herping posts. No specific location data. (If there's multiple photos maybe require an album submission rather than multiple single photos).

I'm willing to volunteer my time to be a mod on this subreddit. I don't mod anywhere else. I'm an ex breeder, and currently work as an invasive species researcher. If I can get approval from the current mods would you guys be cool with having me as a mod?",,False,self,t5_2re9t,1358267014.0,,
