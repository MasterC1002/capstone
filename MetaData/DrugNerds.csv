1356771045.0,15m9sf,MDMA Supplementation,MisterYouAreSoDumb,276,68,240,"Ok, this may be long winded. Obviously everything I put on this list is not necessary. I will be placing supplements into different categories

_______________________________________________________
**Essential Supplements:**

* **Alpha Lipoic Acid**- This is one that everyone should be taking. [It is a powerful antioxidant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7649494) that scavenges reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. It also has a nice benefit of regenerating other vitamins, R-ALA and S-ALA. R-ALA is the biologically active isomer that we are looking for. Most supplements are racemic, or a mix of both. Racemic ALA does not reach as high of plasma levels as R-ALA, nor does it stay in the blood as long. It's half life is very short, ~30min. If that is all you can find, it's much better than nothing. R-ALA by itself is very unstable, and is not suitable for supplementation. This is where bonding it to sodium comes into play. Na-R-ALA, allows for stable delivery of just the dextrorotory isomer of ALA. [Here is a study on the benefits of Na-R-ALA](http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdf). [And here is the study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619665) showing that ALA prevented MDMA induced neurotoxicity

Dosage and time schedule: 

Racemic ALA- 200mg before MDMA dose and every hour of roll.

Na-R-ALA- 100mg before and every 2 hours of roll.

* **Bioavailable magnesium supplement**- [MDMA induces a release of extracellular glutamate in the hippocampus.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23179355) Glutamate is the body's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. It binds to NMDA receptor sites, calcium concentrations can become too high in the neuron. This can lower the effectiveness of your ion channels, or can even cause neuronal death. [Magnesium is the substance your body uses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044576584710128) to block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner. This means that the ion channel will not allow Ca2+ to pass, even if glutamate and glycine are bound to their receptor sites. However, once the neuronal membrane's electrical potential rises to an excited state, the [Mg molecule will clear](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1661812) the channel and allow for normal operation. Most people are deficient in magnesium as it is. Supplementing a highly bioavailable magnesium supplement will give your body the substance it needs to naturally protect itself from excitotoxicity. [Here is a picture I made to illustrate.](http://imgur.com/1rREv) There are a number of different types of magnesium supplements. Some are not absorbed very well, other are. The most common form, is one of the worst. This is where the concept of chelation comes into play. Magnesium is a substance the readily binds to insoluble salts in the stomach and intestines. This makes it hard to absorb. However, L-theonate, etc. I will let you decide on which one you want to try.

Dosage and time schedule:

Magnesium Glycinate- 2, and during.

* **Vitamin C**- This is a widely known antioxidant. It will help scavenge any reactive oxygen species that get created. [It has been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815) to prevent MDMA induced hepatotoxicity. [It has also been shown](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-2396%28200104%2940:1%3C55::AID-SYN1026%3E3.0.CO;2-O/abstract) to mitigate neurotoxicity as well. I like to take Emergen-C packets with me when I am on MDMA. This gives me C, raising my urinary acidity. This allows me to excrete much of the MDMA in my urine before it metabolizes to harmful substances.

Dosage and time schedule:

Emergen-C packet- (1

* **Grape Seed Extract**- GSA is a supplement high in vitamin E and flavonoids. [Vitamin E deficiency has been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860) to increase the severity of MDMA induced neurotoxicity. Also

Dosage and time schedule:

Grape seed extract- 100mg before and during

* **Grapefruit Juice**- My other post spoke about CYP3A4 metabolizing MDMA to MDA using N-demethylation. MDA is [MUCH more neurotoxic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557) than MDMA, like dose, re-dosing schedule, body temperature, etc. Drinking grapefruit juice will drastically inhibit this metabolism. Your MDMA plasma levels will be higher when taking GFJ, so be aware of that when selecting dosages. It also has vitamin C and will increase stomach/intestinal/urinary acidity. This will help excrete MDMA in urine unmetabolized.

Dosage and time schedule: Drink some in the morning

______________________________________________________________________________

**Suggested Supplements:**

* **Acetyl-L-carnitine**- [Is synergistic with](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12640-010-9165-3?LI=true) alpha lipoic acid

Dosage and time schedule: 

ALCAR- 500mg before and during

* **Green Tea Extract (EGCG)**- Is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. It will help with the urinary retention arising from [MDMA induced vasopressin release](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574714).

Dosage and time schedule: 

Green tea extract- 400mg before and during

* **5-HTP**- 5-HTP is the direct precursor to serotonin (5-HT). It is created from tryptophan in your diet using the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). [MDMA can reduce TPH levels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8496826) for weeks after use. This will make it harder for your body to produce the necessary 5-HT from normal dietary sources alone. Since 5-HTP does not need TPH, you want to make sure it gets converted to 5-HT in your brain and not your periphery. The enzyme that converts 5-HTP to 5-HT is aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. [It is found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/241675) in your stomach and periphery, as well as your brain. This means that we have to inhibit it, so that your 5-HTP has time to pass your blood brain barrier. [EGCG is an inhibitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11374875) of L-amino acid decarboxylase (Also known as DOPA decarboxylase). ALWAYS take EGCG with your 5-HTP to ensure that your brain is getting the serotonin, and not your periphery. Excess 5-HT in the periphery can [cause heart valve damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15781732).

Dosage and time schedule: 

5-HTP (with 400mg EGCG)- 100mg before bed for 3-7 days following MDMA use

* **Melatonin**- Melatonin is created from serotonin. Your body uses it to control sleep/wake cycles. [It is also a very powerful antioxidant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000). After using MDMA, but will also help scavenge any oxidative substances your other antioxidants have missed.

Dosage and time schedule:

Melatonin- 5-10mg before bed (Keep in mind we are using a higher dose here for it's antioxidant properties. Normal dosages should be .5mg to 1mg.)

* **CoQ10**- When your NMDA receptors open and allow Ca2+ to influx into the neuron, which will allow your protein pumps to be able to expel the excess Ca2+ more efficiently. This will protect your neurons from exitotoxicity.

Dosage and time schedule:

CoQ10- 100mg before

In every one of these threads, as many will argue back that temperatures below combustion should release most of the drugs into the air, and that higher temperatures only causes nonactive carcinogens to release.

While this is sometimes explained by the few cannabinoids that vaporize at temperatures close to combustion (such as CBD) or by the psychological effect of smoking

Very few people are aware of this

Acetaldehyde is a neurotoxic chemical that is created by smoking [tobacco](http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+75-07-0) or [cannabis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18705690) (as well as most other things). It is the primary metabolite of [ethanol](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol44/volume44.pdf). It is recognized as [a carcinogen](http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out275_en.pdf)

Unfortunately

Acetaldehyde [combines with serotonin precursors as well as dopamine to form the Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) harman and salsolinol.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17382522) This augments the [MAOI effects of cannabinoids](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20401651)

There are many other carcinogens in smoke

This is probably disheartening to hear, furthermore, that the three of the most commonly used 'drugs' are most enjoyable and addictive in their most toxic forms. Of course, these drugs are still enjoyable without this addictive toxin, but nothing's quite like that carcinogenic high.

**tl;dr: Smoking might feel better than vaporizing because acetaldehyde gets you mad high.**

1353553996.0,13lp0b,MDMA Neurotoxicity Part 1 Metabolites),MisterYouAreSoDumb,144,13,122,"This is probably going to be the first in a series of discussions I start about MDMA. There's just too much information for one post. Therefore

_________________________________________________

First off

________________________________________________

MDMA is 3

HHMA is 3

So your CYP2D6 enzyme added two hydrogen atoms to the methylenedioxy structure to create a dihydroxy structure. Once it's been o-demethylated to HHMA

This is the primary route of metabolism.
________________________________________________________

Is that the end of the story? Nope! Yes MDMA is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. However,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. You see, this time your CYP3A4 enzyme changed the methyl group at the N position, and not the O position. This modified the methyl group into an amine group. We are now left with MDMA's more neurotoxic brother in our blood stream.

[Let's add this into the picture from above.](http://imgur.com/xTDcQ)

_________________________________________________

MDA is then metabolized in the exact same manner MDMA was,4-dihydroxyamphetamine. So we essentially end up with HHMA with an amine group at the N position instead of a methyl group. It can also be o-methylated further (like HHMA) into HMA 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine. Same thing as HMMA, just with an amine group instead of the methyl group. 

_____________________________________________

So at this point you might be thinking how this all really matters. Well MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain have [been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11351932) to **NOT** be neurotoxic. Well shit

Not so fast! [A study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1908797/pdf/brjpharm00190-0167.pdf) showed that individuals with lower CYP2D6 did not show lower neurotoxicity. In fact

___________________________________________

So what is up then? Well where is the next logical place to look? Perhaps **CYP3A4!!!!!**

__________________________________________

A person that has a genetic condition resulting in lower CYP2D6 enzyme is going to have what happen to their MDMA? A greater percentage will be N-demethylated to MDA by CYP3A4.

This is going to lead to what? Higher HHA serum levels.

HHA is what? [A potent neurotoxin!](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)

____________________________________________________

So MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain show NO neurotoxicity. Individuals with lower CYP2D6 enzyme show higher levels of neurotoxicity. This leads me to believe that HHMA is not the primary culprit (probably still a factor though).

MDA has been shown to be much more neurotoxic than MDMA. MDA is NOT neurotoxic when directly injected into the brain. MDA cannot be metabolized into HHMA

Is anybody smelling what I am cooking over here?!? MDA is the cause of MDMA's neurotoxicity through metabolism to HHA (Also known as alpha-methyldopamine). **BOOM!**

[Alpha-methyldopamine causes neurotoxicity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836)

[Another link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)


[And another!](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/37/7/1448.full.pdf)

______________________________________________________

Now I have been taking quercetin and grapefruit juice with my MDMA for a while now. These substances are CYP3A4 inhibitors. I knew that CYP3A4 metabolized part of my dose to MDA. I knew it was more neurotoxic

Many postulated it was because of MDA's higher affinity for dopamine. However, it would be higher. Yet we saw NO neurotoxicity.

Others were skeptical because the metabolism to HHA was only seen in rats. However

**TL;DR I postulate that MDMA induced 5-HT neurotoxicity arises from the metabolism to MDA,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine. Inhibit CYP3A4 using grapefruit juice to stop the metabolism to MDA and prevent both metabolites from being created.**

1368513199.0,1eau4s,Selegiline to prevent MDMA Neurotoxicity,Ddanimal,60,13,56,"I am writing to spread the good news about combining selegiline and MDMA. Selegiline dramatically reduces MDMA neurotoxicity and enhances the effects of MDMA. In my experience and the experience of my friends

Selegiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor. It blocks the activity of the MAO-B enzyme

MAO-B is a primary cause of MDMA toxicity. MAO-B produces toxic products when it acts on MDMA metabolites or dopamine. When coming down from a roll, dopamine penetrates into serotonin channels, where its not supposed to be. Dopamine then contacts MAO-B, which produces toxic metabolites that cause significant oxidative damage to serotonin neurons. Some dispute that its the dopamine, and instead argue that only MDMA metabolites are the cause. But either way, its the MAO-B enzyme that creates the toxins. MAO-B also creates neurotoxic products when it acts on other drugs, such as some cancer chemo drugs. 

Accordingly

A scientific paper published in 2007 reported the results of animal experiments in which the neuroprotective effect of selegiline was proven. The title is ""Monoamine Oxidase-B Mediates Ecstasy-Induced Neurotoxic Effects to Adolescent Rat Brain Mitochondria"" by Alves et al. Link is here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881526

There are a couple of important safety precautions to be aware of: 1) NON-selective MAO inhibition while taking MDMA is dangerous. So dont dake anything that is an MAO-A inhibitor. 2) Selegiline at high dosages becomes NON-SELECTIVE. At 1-2 mg it is selective for MAO-B only. At dosages possibly as low as 10mg, and suffer less of the other types of MDMA toxicity. But this also means that one can trip too hard. So take selegiline BEFORE rolling, and titrate the MDMA dose, especially the first time using this combo. I estimate that selegiline can potentiate about 2-3 fold (so you only need about 1/2-1/3 the dose).

Selegiline is generally available by script only

Im curious to hear if others have experiences

&gt;Science has *proven* that marijuana use in this age bracket (15-18) can lead to a decrease in potential IQ because

**A case of 25I-NBOMe (25-I) intoxication: a new potent 5-HT2A agonist designer drug.**

&gt;Abstract
&gt;CONTEXT:
&gt;Abuse of synthetic stimulant compounds resulting in significant toxicity is being increasingly reported by poison centers. Toxicologic assessment is complicated by inconsistent manufacturing processes and limited laboratory testing. We describe a case of self-reported exposure to 25-I (25I-NBOMe)
&gt;CASE DETAILS:
&gt;An 18-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe agitation and hallucinations after jumping out of a moving car. He was tachycardiac (150-160 bpm) and hypertensive (150-170 mm Hg systolic and 110 mg Hg diastolic), and serum obtained during ED evaluation and treatment was found to contain 0.76 ng/ml of 25-I. Case discussion. For 25I-NBOMe, 25-I is a common abbreviation for 25I-NBOMe, which is a (n-benzyl) phenethylamine in the 2C ""family.""Initially synthesized for research, cases of self-reported use of 25-I have recently appeared in the literature, some of which contain qualitative urine confirmation. There are no commercially available quantitative assays, and no previous reports have published serum concentrations. 25-I is a potent new synthetic drug with apparent significant behavioral toxicity that can be detected and quantified in serum.

&gt;Context. 4-Iodo-2, presented to hospitals in the northeast of England with clinical toxicity after recreational drug use in January 2013. Clinical features included tachycardia (n = 7), hypertension (4), agitation (6), aggression, visual and auditory hallucinations (6), seizures (3), clonus (2), and acute kidney injury (1). LC–MS/MS analysis identified 25I-NBOMe as the main active substance in the plasma of all seven cases. Conclusions. Severe clinical toxicity may occur following recreational use of 25I-NBOMe

**Radiosynthesis and Evaluation of 11C-CIMBI-5 as a 5-HT2A Receptor Agonist Radioligand for PET**

&gt;Abstract
&gt;
&gt;PET brain imaging of the serotonin 2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A, several well-validated radiolabeled antagonist tracers are used for in vivo imaging of the cerebral 5-HT2A receptor. Access to 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET tracers would, however, enable imaging of the active, high-affinity state of receptors, which may provide a more meaningful assessment of membrane-bound receptors. In this study, we radiolabel the high-affinity 5-HT2A receptor agonist 2-(4-iodo-2, and PET with 11C-CIMBI-5 was conducted in pigs. Results: In vitro assays showed that CIMBI-5 was a high-affinity agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor. After intravenous injections of 11C-CIMBI-5, and the target-to-background ratio was similar to that of the widely used 5-HT2A receptor antagonist PET tracer 18F-altanserin. Ketanserin treatment reduced the cortical binding potentials to cerebellar levels

&gt;Abstract Drugs that modulate serotonin (5-ht) synaptic concentrations impact neurogenesis and hippocampal

&gt;determine the extent to which psilocybin (PsOP) modulates 
&gt;neurogenesis and thereby affects acquisition and extinction of hPc-dependent trace fear conditioning. PsOP
&gt;5-ht2a agonist 25I-NBMeO and the 5-ht2a/c

**Molecular Interaction of Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Residues Phe339(6.51) and Phe340(6.52) with Superpotent N-Benzyl Phenethylamine Agonists**

&gt;ABSTRACT
&gt;Experiments were conducted to examine the molecular basis
&gt;for the high affinity and potency of a new class of 5-HT2A
&gt;receptor agonists
&gt;binding assays at several serotonin receptors confirmed that an
&gt;N-arylmethyl substitution was necessary for affinity increases
&gt;up to 300-fold over simple N-alkyl homologs
&gt;agonists at the rat 5-HT2A receptor. Virtual docking of these
&gt;compounds into a human 5-HT2A receptor homology model
&gt;indicated that the N-benzyl moiety might be interacting with
&gt;Phe339(6.51)
&gt;be interacting with Phe340(6.52). Experiments in h5-HT2A receptors with Phe339(6.51)L and Phe340(6.52)L mutations seem to

There really are SO many more GREAT papers on the hippocampus

Which I think these studies show the reasoning why memory takes a hit




**On a side note:**


I've done 25i 30-40 times

**Also we still need to know the specifics:**


- rapid super tolerance (check: higher rate of hppd)
- some report possible perma-tolerance (unsupported so far)
- Future trips up to 6 months feel reminiscent of NBOMe
- Muscle twitching* in the weeks after* (neurodegenerative? check: 7 case study results)
- some report headaches/migrains for up to 3/4weeks.
- Much higher rate of HPPD (check: 5ht2a saturation and mutation
- why does piracetam a neuroprotective compound allow people to remember trips in vivid detail? What role does this play in the hippcampus with neurogensis (check: latest paper on neurogensis and memory coding)
- some report hair oil changes
- more on the uncommon kidney pain


I have some theories

Proper dosages and spread out seems to be ok

two distintly different subtypes of K trip. A while back I had the distinct pleasure of trying the S and R isomers side by side

What amazed me the most is that the two are opposites of each other.

Let's start with S.

An S isomer trip is sedated and dreamy. Lounging around on the couch listening to Ravi Shankar with eyes closed is just perfect. CEVs are pronounced, and peaceful. It's also the psychic/mind reading isomer.Thoughts, words, sounds and lights combine to form a new language that is understood. OEVs can be outstanding. A living room can become the deck of a ship out at sea, or a stage with actors on it. It still maintains its overall form as a room though. Connections to external things are few. The world exists inside of me and I inside of it. Nothing to worry about. A pleasant come down ensues. 

An then there's R. R makes me get up and talk and walk. Things get done, which seems to reside elsewhere, at high doses everywhere.There is a great machine at work. I am both moving it as it moves me. It is external, yet I can feel it inside of me. Then I go for a ride. I'm in a series of passages, moving rapidly horizontally, then vertically. I'm communicating with the others that are there. I'm moving through the machine. The me I usually know is just one aspect of a transdimensional being. I can see the higher dimensional me at the controls, each frame of time flipping by. These are physical spaces. Extreme disorientation

So there you have it. Most K is racemic. It contains both isomers in varying proportions so we usually get a taste of both. If I had to choose a favourite it would definitely be R.",self,t5_2sk32,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15kkdw/ketamine_2_drugs_in_one/

 As most of you guys know

Something that many of you may not know, many of these fatty acid amides (FAA) show activity at both cb1 and cb2 receptors in varying degrees.

One of the more well known of these amides is oleamide. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleamide)
""Oleamide is an amide of the fatty acid oleic acid. It is an endogenous substance: it occurs naturally in the body of animals. It accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid during sleep deprivation and induces sleep in animals.[2] It is being studied as a potential medical treatment for mood and sleep disorders

Oleic acid is a main component of olive oil.
Oleic acid 56 grams (0.2 mole) and 36 grams (0.6 moles) urea are
mixed and rapidly heated to 230 degrees. The mixture is heated for two hours and then extracted with naphtha. The naphtha extract is washed
with water. 2 grams of activated carbon are added and then filtered off. More naphtha is added (eg. 75 mL. per 10 grams). The mixture is chilled (0 degrees C.) yields 40-50% oleamide. Pure ole amide can be obtained by repeated crystallizations from ethanol (30-40% yield).

This above reaction can be applied to the majority of fatty acids to provide the matching fatty acid amide. One may replace urea with isopropylamine

Fatty acid amide derivatives from DHA are a primary interest to me.
The simple amide
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22959887

http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/9/1584.abstract
The omega-3 fatty acid ethanolamides, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells. DHEA and EPEA activated cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors in vitro with significant potency, suggesting that they are endocannabinoids.

I've had a great interest in psychoactives since I first read the wikipedia article on ""Levels of Psychedelic Experience"". Since then I've read countless trip reports

Now, beyond high-school biology and chemistry; and an amateur interest). Most of my interest lies in psychedelics/hallucinogens, but I understand the whole topic is interlinked. As far as I can discern, the main facets of ""drugs"" to be more aware of are:

* Neuroscience
- Here I already have a limited knowledge (i.e., secondary messengers, competitive and non-competitive inhibitors, agonists and antagonists etc.) of the biology but I understand this is an important aspect. 

So far I have taken advantage of the free course materials available on MIT for introductions to neuroscience and cognitive science

* Pharmacology
- So far I understand the role of similarities between neurotransmitters and psychoactives to an extent. I have read about affinity for receptors and ligands

I am currently reading PiKHAL and TiKHAL (and found the Structural Tour of PiKHAL incredibly helpful on the chemistry side) but I am at a loss for how I can progress in pharmacology otherwise - so any useful materials would be greatly appreciated.

* Organic chemistry
- Here my school-level education is semi-useful... I know the real basic organic reactions and a little laboratory knowledge

I have again downloaded several course materials on synthesis and general organic chemistry

* Cultural/social/spiritual implications
- This is probably the most expansive section of all! I have read the Doors of Perception and Fear and Loathing... but would love to know what are considered the most seminal works are in the realm of psychedelia. I am interested in all the typical stuff, Timothy Leary etc. but it often feels overwhelming.

TL;DR - Interested in psychoactives. How can I become properly educated in the matter?

An abstract from probably the most interesting paper of sulbutiamine pharmacology

&gt;Chronic treatment of rats by **sulbutiamine induced no change in density of** N-methyl-d-aspartate (**NMDA**) **and** (±)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid [**AMPA**] receptors in the cingular cortex, **an increase of D1 dopaminergic (DA) binding sites was measured both in the prefrontal and the cingular cortex, while no modification of the D2 binding sites was detected.** Furthermore, **an acute sulbutiamine administration induced a decrease of kainate binding sites but no change of the density of D1 and D2 DA receptors. Acute sulbutiamine injection led to a decrease of the DA levels in the prefrontal cortex** and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in both the cingular and the prefrontal cortex. These observations are discussed in terms of a modulatory effect of sulbutiamine on both dopaminergic and glutamatergic cortical transmissions.
(from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394000014208 )

More from the same paper:

&gt;The decreased levels of DOPAC suggest a reduced release of DA in the prefrontal cortex. The increased density of D1 DA receptors 2 h following a chronic treatment (Fig. 2), the changes in density of kainate receptor in the cortex lead to suggest that sulbutiamine and/or its metabolites may modulate the cortical glutamatergic transmission. **In fact, the rapid decrease observed immediately following a single injection suggests a direct effect on the cortical glutamatergic transmission, for instance a modulation of the intra-synaptic glutamate concentration.** Cellular mechanisms responsible for the effects of sulbutiamine are unknown. Thiamine triphosphate, a derivative significantly enhanced in rat brain following an injection of sulbutiamine, could have modulatory effect on neuronal membrane permeability [2] and [3]. Such a modulation induces ionic changes, and further modulate the binding on kainate receptors. Changes on glutamatergic transmission could be at the origin of the modulation of dopaminergic cortical transmission. Indeed, anatomical and electrophysiological studies report the modulation of dopaminergic cortical transmission by glutamate, chronic blockade of dopaminergic transmission by antipsychotic drugs does not change the density of cortical kainate binding sites
The interactions between dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmissions within the prefrontal cortex could play a pivotal role in the therapeutic action of sulbutiamine. Those results strongly support recent findings that demonstrate improvement in behavioural, alcoholic and depressed patients [5], [7] and [11]. Other experiments, including release and/or uptake studies, have to be conducted in order to further investigate the respective role of the cortical glutamatergic and dopaminergic cortical transmissions in the effect of sulbutiamine.

So from this first paper we have -

Modulation / ""direct effect"" on glutmate -?-&gt; Decrease in DA --&gt; Increase in D1 receptors

I can't tell whether the glutamatergic modulation is causing the drop in DA or if it's independent. But it seems since the effects on DA are more based on chronic usage and the kainate changes are virtually immediate that the glutamatergic effect may be causing the dopaminergic effects. And then there's the fact that AMPA and NMDA are not downregulated.

It seems to me from this mechanism that excitotoxicity is a concern.

Another abstract:

&gt;Thiamine deficiency in both man and animals is known to produce memory dysfunction and cognitive disorders which have been related to an impairment of cholinergic activity. The present experiment was aimed at testing whether, sulbutiamine treated mice learned the task at the same rate in a single session but showed greatly improved performance when tested 24 hr after partial acquisition of the same task. Parallel neurochemical investigations showed that **the treatment induced a slight (+ 10%) but significant increase in hippocampal sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake.** The present findings and previous results suggest that sulbutiamine improves memory formation and that this behavioral effect could be mediated by an increase in hippocampal cholinergic activity.

So sulbutiamine also increases choline uptake (ie increases ACh).

And one last abstract:

&gt;Cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activities and nycthemeral states of vigilance organization were studied in 6 adult rhesus monkeys during subchronic administration (10 days) of Sulbutiamin, increase in stage 1. REM sleep duration remained stable. These changes, occurring at around day 5 of the treatment, were more pronounced on day 10 and disappeared 2-5 days after withdrawal.** This study demonstrated the clear action of Sulbutiamin upon the mechanisms regulating waking and light sleep.

So it disrupts sleep. I can't tell if this is from the glutamatergic or dopaminergic mechanisms

1362439411.0,19o3lz,Questions/discussion on MDMA neurotoxicity? Warning: long/controversial post,drpotatoe,30,3,62,"I’m curious

Dr. Carhart-Harris wrote this in his AMA:

&gt;There's no known cell death with either drug (psilocybin vs. MDMA) but MDMA can damage serotonin cell fibres in large doses.

To clarify, but close enough), I participate in MAPS events, etc. etc., I’m just looking for a legitimate conversation on this topic between intellectuals aware of the science, without asking for sources. If we’re on this sub, we should be aware of the science

What I’m about to say is controversial and will be attacked

I believe that MDMA-induced neuroxicity is overhyped on reddit. Every pharmaceutical and recreational drug I am aware of is neurotoxic. Yes, or phenomenological standpoint, how much does moderate MDMA-usage *actually* affect MDMA users? How does it effect their daily life and functionality as a human? Furthermore, how does alcohol, marijuana, and psychedelics effect users in comparison to MDMA ? Not to mention, how does daily amphetamine usage effect little kids? 

I’ve encountered ‘e-tards’

I’ve talked multiple professors on this subject, but is it enough to make some of conclusions I see utilized in clinical practice and posted on science forums? This applies to all drugs, whether or not they are used therapeutically or recreationally. I just want to take a step back and look at what’s happening from all angles.

Step 1: take drug

Step 2: drug has effect on chemistry

Step 3: physiological response

But what determines the physiological response? Is free will involved? If it is

I don’t know. But if you were to use MDMA or 4-FA on a semi regular basis (once every week or two), could your body *potentially* overcome the neurotoxic effects and protect your brain? Similar to how people exposed to other toxins can form defense mechanisms? If you no longer experience bruxism or hangovers, and you’re completely satisfied with the experience that you are maintaining at a constantly low dose level, and there are no notable behavioral effects that are affecting your life in any significant way, is it still bad to use the MDMA/4-FA more than once every 3 months? If the neuronal death is related to oxidative stress and hyperthermia, could you control this through using antioxidants and not overheating? Would you still experience neurotoxicity if you aren't overheating and not feeling a hangover and using supplements and not using a high dose?

**TLDR:** What is MDMA-neurotoxicity? Is it *really* that much worse than other drugs? How confident are you with our current knowledge of neuropharmacology? Is free-will worth considering in the equation? Can your body become resistant to the neurotoxic effects?

**Disclaimer:** I’m not trying to pick a fight, or just say everything above is bullshit, because I really want to have a discussion on this topic. I won’t necessarily reply to comments that aren’t within the philosophical spirit, but I would prefer a rude reply over a down vote, just because I want people to see the discussion.

My experience is probably best described as the quintessential ego-death experience in that I became pure consciousness and forgot entirely that ""I"" exist.  

While at the height of my trip, really I'm not sure given the level of disorientation I experienced.  I also wonder if I perhaps I am biased to impart that meaning on what I experienced, given that the presence of entities seems to be ubiquitous among DMT trip reports.   

This leads me to my question... While I am not trying to discredit what many people seem to experience (existence of alternative realities, etc.), I am merely looking for more empirical or scientific theories on what the DMT experience entails.

1) What kind of professional/educational background would the chemist need? I have 3 years of undergrad laboratory science so its not like I'm ignorant (I can read Shulgin's recipes and understand what he's doing)

2) How willing would such a chemist likely be to take such an offer? If the lab is for personal use there would only be whatever salary was paid since there would be no piles of drug money. Also no prestige from publishing. How rare are people this good? I get the feel that a lot of illicit chemists are second tier. Does the underground simply not appeal to the best chemists?

3) Assuming there was no drug selling or trafficking how secure could it be? Other than sourcing controlled precursors (not a problem really

4) Any idea of costs to get requisite equipment? Looking at Shulgin's recipes it looks like a few dozen grand would be sufficient for all equipment

5) The weird question: does a chemist have to ""get"" psychedelics to do it right.

This got me thinking what the evolutionary effect of this would be. It seems Europeans with low resistance to ergot alkaloids were being selected against during the middle ages; ergot poisoning was often fatal, this force of selection was acting on Europeans for centuries.

The most significant instances would be the outbreaks that occurred following the Bubonic Plague. The massive amounts of deaths (20% or something like that) resulted in a bottleneck effect on the European populations; the gene pool lost much of its diversity. Following the plague, and then ergot poisoning selecting for the resistant ones left in the smaller population, the evolutionary effects (increased resistance) would occur more rapidly and be more significant.

What effect would this have on the population as a whole? I would think that it would cause Europeans, LSD. Perhaps Europeans have a higher resistance to LSD, or experience the trip in a different way, their bodies perhaps processing it slightly differently. I don't know, just a thought I have been playing with in my head, any thoughts?

I appreciate that we need to understand the neurotoxicity of these novel psychostimulants but walking into an experiment armed with the hypothesis that these chemicals cause brain damage from the get go seems terribly biased and preserving that hypothesis after collecting data pointing to lack of neurotoxicity is at best perplexing and at worst unscrupulous. The insistence that simply because neurosis was not exhibited in dopamine nerve endings in the striatum means it could be toxic elsewhere in the brain is presumptuous. The final proposed neurotoxic mechanism is prolonged vasoconstriction from binge use of the stimulants

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history in stroke therapy and its therapeutic efficacy has been confirmed by clinical studies.

We wondered whether or not the neuroprotective effect of TCMs might be due to their N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist properties. We used the patch-clamp technique to screen 22 TCM stroke drugs for NMDAR antagonist activity in cultured cortical neurons. The drugs were also screened for their ability to abate NMDA-induced neurotoxicity.

Today I stumbled onto some information regarding psychoactive basil oil. It's rather old
&gt;I’ve ingested up to 10 drops of sweet basil oil containing about 70% methyl chavicol. The effects start in about 30 minutes and seem to peak after 90 minutes. Overall the effects last a few hours. It’s mild at that dose. It’s relaxing, that’s right, at 10 drops for me it is mildly psychedelic. I experienced very mild visuals from it at that dose. This is actually not too surprising. Methyl chavicol (para-methoxyallyl benzene) is very closely related to PMA (also known as para-methoxyamphetamine, 4-methoxyamphetamine, or 4-MA) which is a known psychedelic amphetamine sometimes sold as MDMA.

&gt;Apparently methyl chavicol, it was found that 5+ grams of German chamomile (a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor) greatly potentiates the effects of elemicin, making it both stronger and more psychedelic. It’s possible that German chamomile might have a similar affect with methyl chavicol.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/14mc0n/what_are_the_components_of_mdma_neurotoxicity_and/

From what I've read MDMA induced neurotoxicity consists from the following:

* Oxidation damage due to dopamine being absorbed into serotonin releasing cells. I believe I got this from a neuroimaging study.

Irreversible

* Reduced SERT (5-HTT)-channel activity. David Erritzoe's neuroimaging study had pretty cool data on this including how it relates to dose and usage frequency.

Changes back over time except for in the neocortex. Unpreventable but dose and frequency dependable.

* Downregulation (is this the same as tolerance?) of your DA and 5-HTxy receptors

The sensitivity of your 5-HTxy receptors returns to baseline after ~7 days and you can't really prevent this either. I can't remember where I read this though.

I assume that the oxidation damage and downregulation (on the DA receptors) phenomena that are common in MDMA

How often is too often and how much is too much? I'm getting the impression that 150mg is as low and safe as you can go and 500mg is insanity? I think the first time I took it it was about 300mg so that was probably far too much. Hypothetically

Is every month too often? I keep reading that a month is like the minimum recovery time... but if you were doing it repeatedly

Am I too young to be doing this now? I'm not expecting a solid answer on this from anyone... but I have read that the brain continues to develop well into your 20s and I am still only 22. I remember deciding that if I was ever going to get heavily into smoking pot I would leave it until after the age of 25 for this reason - could the same logic be applied to MDMA?

If you take all of the supplements and antioxidants and keep doses/body temperature low etc... would you expect zero neurotoxicity/tolerance buildup or still a small amount?

[This graph shows this effect more clearly](http://i.imgur.com/wj1ZC.png)

Now LSD is obviously an anomaly in this case but as you can see the less potent a psychedelic is vs. its binding efficacy the more PLC it releases (aka DOB: low binding efficacy but high agonist properties). LSD on the other hand has high bonding efficacy but low activation profiles. Most people will agree that LSD is less effective at causing HPPD than phenethylamine psychedelics such as 2C-E and that LSD cases of HPPD occur mainly due to its prevalence as one of the most commonly used psychedelics.

My theory is this: due to the unusual mechanism of Phospholipase release arising from psychedelic use and the partial depletion of these acids the receptor causes irregularities when they are replenished. To simplify this:

Normal serotonin activation of 5HT2a produces (rough guess) release of 60% PLC and 40% PLa2.

Say a Psychedelic binds and releases 75% of the PLC but only 10% of the PLa2. So upon replenishment more PLC is produced to account for the increased activation. The balance in the receptor is now 61% PLC and 39% PLa2. When serotonin activates it a more psychedelic style activation occurs than before producing HPPD symptoms. More selective releasers will change the balance more heavily. Upon continued activation by ""normal"" agonists (serotonin) this balance returns to normal hence a reduction in HPPD symptoms. 

This theory also accounts for why Benzodiazapenes and antipsychotics reduce HPPD symptoms. Benzos directly affect glutamate levels in the cortex oppositely from a psychedelic effect so would reduce unusual excitation. Antipsychotics work in an opposite fashion on 5HT2A receptors to psychedelics so will redress the balance of phospholipases in a inverse fashion.

&amp;nbsp;  

* Abstract:

&gt;Cannabis use typically begins during adolescence and early adulthood, with no previous studies examining its impact on axonal connectivity. The aim of this study was to examine axonal fibre pathways across the brain for evidence of microstructural alterations associated with long-term cannabis use and to test whether age of regular cannabis use is associated with severity of any microstructural change. To this end, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and brain connectivity mapping techniques were performed in 59 cannabis users with longstanding histories of heavy use and 33 matched controls. Axonal connectivity was found to be impaired in the right fimbria of the hippocampus (fornix), splenium of the corpus callosum and commissural fibres. Radial and axial diffusivity in these pathways were associated with the age at which regular cannabis use commenced. Our findings indicate long-term cannabis use is hazardous to the white matter of the developing brain. Delaying the age at which regular use begins may minimize the severity of microstructural impairment.

The pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is very complex, either by release or reuptake inhibition of these neurotransmitters, or direct agonism of D2 or 5HT3 receptors. One of the most commonly mentioned 'cures' for psychedelic nausea is antihistamine antiemetics such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), or promethazine. However, these have not been succesful for me, and logically, since they do not directly affect the pro-emetic pharmacological actions of psychedelics. Additionally

It seems that the best way to prevent nausea from psychedelics would be to block the 5HT3 or D2 receptors. There are several pharmaceutical drugs that are used for this purpose, and metoclopramide, which is a comibination 5HT3/D2 antagonist and 5HT4 agonist. However, it is unclear whether these drug would have any negative interactions with psychedelic drugs (though if it is true that ondansetron has ONLY an antagonist action at 5HT3, I can't imagine that it would have any negative interactions). Also, I do not know if these drugs have any palpable psychoactivity. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure that at least in the U.S., further limiting their use for this purpose.

There are other 5HT3 antagonists which can be found from natural sources, which is a 5HT3 antagonist, as well as other bioactives which may act as anti-emetics in some way. Essential oil of lemon also may have anti-emetic effects, due to the presence of beta-pinene, which is a 5HT3 antagonist. There are many other folk remedies for nausea that may rely in part on antagonism of these receptors, many of which I have not tried. In my experience, ginger and lemon oil are very hit-or-miss when used to treat psychedelic nausea. However, or that I have found ginger or lemon oil products which have the necessary quantity of bioactives. I do not know of any places where I could successfully purchase pure galanolactone or beta-pinene.

Can anyone else comment on the efficacy of any of the drugs I have mentioned, might other serotonin receptors be very important in the physiology of nausea? In that case, a less selective serotonin receptor antagonist might be best, but then perhaps it must be peripheral, in order to preserve the psychedelic's action in the brain.",,False,t5_2sk32,True

* NMDA sensitization of dopamine system - 

NMDA antagonists such as DXM (of special interest due to its voltage independent action at NMDA)

* AMPA modulation e.g. Piracetam - 

Many people report Piracetam to boost the effects of MDMA. I'm not familiar with the effects of AMPA modulation in the brain so maybe someone can fill in? 

* 5-HTP preloading - 

Preloading 5-HTP was proven [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7934616) to reduce neurotoxicity

* Monoamine release balancing - 

Although not personally familiar with these compounds some people report improved euphoria from MDA and Mephedrone over MDMA. This could be due to superior monoamine release ratios. Perhaps with balancing by SRA/DRAs the positive euphoriant effects of MDMA could be improved?

Reading about it and this passage sums it up nicely.

A person takes a very small dose, it blocks the receptors in the same way but only for several hours. the body makes all its endorphins at night while we sleep, as these receptors are blocked they signal the body to produce a lot more as there's no feed back, then the drugs effects pass, those receptors are unregulated and the amount of endorphins in the system is vastly increased for the next 24 hours.

These endorphins are the controllers of the immune system, parkisons, MS, depression, chronic fatigue etc etc with good results, increases libido/sensitivity, and general life experience is deeper

**Potential Strategies for Reducing Risk of Neurotoxicity in Clinical Settings**

&gt;Because the range of psychoactive but non-neurotoxic MDMA doses appears narrow in most species and the possible long-term consequences of neurotoxicity are unknown, it is probably worth noting that these factors may increase body temperature, which is associated with increased MDMA neurotoxicity in rats. 

**tl;dr: MDMA has a narrow dosing range where its effects are non-neurotoxic; neurotoxicity increases with rising body temperatures.**

&gt;In addition, the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of MDMA suggest that small increases in dose may lead to large increases in plasma MDMA levels (de la Torre, 2000; Mas, 1999) and, possibly, risk of neurotoxicity. Administration of a small 'booster' dose to lengthen MDMA intoxication may also increase risk, given the apparently saturable metabolism of MDMA. The possible benefits of such 'booster' doses should be carefully weighted against this risk.

**tl;dr: Even non-neurotoxic doses likely put stress on the brain; a small increase in dose (including booster doses) can cause a large increase in body MDMA concentration and lead to neurotoxicity.**

&gt;Anecdotal reports suggest that many ecstasy users are already employing pharmacological interventions that have been found to be neuroprotective in rodent MDMA studies. These interventions include antioxidants, it is not always clear that humans can achieve comparable neuroprotection with oral dosing. This is particularly in question for vitamin C, which has saturable absorption and increased clearance after high doses in humans (Blanchard, 1997; Graumlich, 1997). Similarly, rodent studies using 5-hydroxytryptophan typically co-administer another drug to decrease peripheral metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptophan, allowing more to reach the brain. Oral administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan in humans therefore may not achieve adequate brain levels.

**tl;dr: Neurotoxicity-reduction strategies already in use include the use of antioxidants; SSRIs; and 5-HTP. These agents have been shown to work when injected directly into rats' brains; however it is not clear if oral doses in humans can provide equivalent protection. This is especially the case for vitamin C and 5-HTP.**

&gt;Keeping in mind the almost complete lack of controlled studies examining these interventions in humans, decreases the effects of l.5 mg/kg MDMA. This study demonstrates that these drugs can be co-administered safely in a clinical setting, despite a previous case report describing a possible adverse interaction between these compounds (Lauerma, 1998). Thus, giving an SSRI at 3 or 4 hours after MDMA administration could be considered if MDMA pharmacokinetics are not being measured and SSRIs are not otherwise contraindicated in the relevant patient or volunteer population.

**tl;dr: There are NO controlled studies examining the effects of the aforementioned strategies in humans

&gt;Antioxidant supplements may also prove useful. Aguirre (1999) reported that twice daily administration of high dose alpha-lipoic acid for two days completely blocked the neurotoxicity of a subsequent single dose of MDMA in rats. Because the acute inactivation of TPH can occur after non-neurotoxic MDMA doses and is due to oxidative stress, may alter urinary pH and thus affect excretion of MDMA. Aside from such possible pharmacokinetic interactions, doses of antioxidants that are known to be well tolerated appear unlikely to increase risk of adverse events and may decrease risks of chronic toxicity.

**tl;dr: Supplementation with high doses of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to block MDMA neurotoxicity in rats. Doses of antioxidants that are known to be well tolerated may decrease the risk of chronic toxicity.**

&gt;Although these potentially neuroprotective strategies are worth considering

**tl;dr: These strategies are worth considering

It feels like I am empty inside and while it's nothing I worry about, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes when I react to things much differently than others. 

I have experimented with many drugs but the only hallucinogen has been psilocybin and that was at an extremely low dose.

5-HTP is a very powerful tool to resolve serotonin depletion that occurs as a result of MDMA's flood like serotonin effects to your brain. However
^[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12466135) Unless you use appropriate amounts of l-lysine which acts as a serotonin antagonist in the gut/heart valve ^[3](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15370.short) and is too competitive with l-arginine too cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with 5-HTP's subjective recovery effects on serotonin depletion. I would also recommend supplementing straight tryptophan

As for antioxidants while your rolling, Melatonin and small amounts of 5-HTP and GABA. I prefer to take them 1 hour before I drop, when I drop and then every two hours till I goto sleep.

It is common knowledge that SSRI withdrawal induces an unpleasant ""zap"" effect

1. SSRI drug blocks the transporter proteins (which would normally bring in Cl- ions to lower the resting potential of the cell).

2. Homeostasis causes more transporter proteins to be produced to counteract the drugs effects.

3. The SSRI is discontinued. Nothing is blocking the excessive transporters now. This causes them to bring an excess of Cl- ions into some cells (or less into others). This causes an irregularity in the resting voltage of the cell.

4. Now when the action potential fires the voltage is potentially to high causing too large an electric discharge

1343525095.0,xbmw6,Recurring loss of tactile sensation,szmar-madar,14,2,5,"Sorry for the wall of text

I have recently been experiencing interesting phenomena and was wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences or information as to what is happening to me. Around 3 months ago I took acid with some friends. I am an experienced and responsible user who had taken a similar dose at least 25+ times before. The trip progressed smoothly - I was enjoying myself with my friends who had also taken a similar dose from the same sheet of acid.

6 hours into the trip I could feel myself beginning to come down. Our group was sitting in a room watching a cartoon to relax having been on a walk, the sensation was powerful and it caused me to direct my attention entirely away from the cartoon as I noted my heart rate rise rapidly.

At this point I left the room to get some air, my heart rate had continued to climb and it was now at a level that I had not experienced outside of a rowing race. All this time I was telling myself to remain calm, but this was easier said than done as I had lost all ability to experience kinetic sensations. I could not feel clothes on me or have a sense of the space that my body occupied. Touching anything with my fingers left a tingling sensation in my fingers, but it remained alien and concerning. When I ran my fingers through my hair it was like being given a painless electric shock – the sensation was so overwhelming that I had to cease immediately, yet no actual pain was felt.

My friend saw that I was distressed and attempted to calm me down, and I had been in many far more intense situations on acid before that I found no real difficulty in dealing with. After pacing around for awhile to see if the effects would subside I was given a beer to see if that would calm me down, I noted with interest that the beer found my lips with ease yet I could not feel the beer in my hand nor have any sensation of my arm moving the can around.

At this point my partner arrived home and asked if I would like a shower to see if that would be of any assistance, as I could not gain a sense of where they were if I could not see them. I became stuck inside my jersey due to this and required assistance to get it over my head. The entire experience was baffling me, I was remaining as calm yet my heart rate was still through the roof.

I eventually fell asleep 2 hours later and awoke to find that I could feel things again, it used to be my favourite drug but I have avoided it since the episode.

Everything seemed to be back to normal, my heart rate shot up despite me remaining perfectly calm. I went and told my friend and tried to explore what was happening to me, I was aware it would fade and tried to remember if anything in my situation paralleled the last one that may have triggered it. After about 4 hours my sense of touch returned, yet I still felt odd. I awake this morning and I feel very bizarre, every now and then I will grab something and be unable to feel it – which is quite concerning. Does anyone have any idea what this is? I have a doctor’s appointment booked but any input is appreciated!

An excerpt from a forum:

&gt;""  Okay, but these studies back up my claims. Now read:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;First thing needed to know is
&gt;
&gt;Second thing I want to address is 4-FA comparison to chlorinated amphetamine
&gt;
&gt;Considerable clinical application of 4-CA has been made, 1976). There are very few side effects noted and the drug is tolerated very well. However, indications of raphe-nucleus degeneration (Yunger et al., 1974) and related neurotoxicity (Harvey and McMaster, 1976) in experimental animals have discouraged further clinical study.
&gt;The same applies to 4-CMA
&gt;
&gt;The N-methyl homolog of 4-chlorophenylisopropylamine (80, S-33) was also found to be a potent and long-lasting depleter of brain serotonin (Fuller et al., 1965). It has been compared with methamphetamine in normal subjects (Verster and van Praag, 1970) and has been evaluated clinically in comparison with 4-CA (79) as an antidepressant (Deniker et al., 1971; van Praag et al., 1971; van Praag and Korf, 1976). Typical dosages were between 60 and 90 mg/day, no cardiovascular complications
&gt;
&gt;Third thing is, compared to irreversible in rats.
&gt;This finding indicated that p-fluoroamphetamine might share with p-chloroamphetamine the action that is responsible for short-term 5-HT depletion but lack the property of p-chloroamphetamine required for long-term effects. A later study confirmed that p-fluoroamphetamine was less potent than p-chloroamphetamine in depleting brain 5-HT (Harvey et al.
&gt;With 4-chloroamphetamine and 4-bromoamphetamine, lowered serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels only for short times (2–6 hr) after drug injection, and 5-hydroxyindole levels were essentially back to normal within 24 hr.
&gt;The failure of 4-fluoroamphetamine to produce a long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin like that produced by 4-chloroamphetamine or 4-bromoamphetamine may reflect the inability of the fluoro-compound to be metabolized in the same way as the other haloamphetamines.
&gt;You see? 4-FA doesn't deplete serotonin in rat brain in irreversible way.
&gt;
&gt;Speculation alert: Looking at the atom radius

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;TL;DR

&gt;1. 4-CA is not neurotoxic in humans

&gt;2. Serotonin levels get back to normal in 24 hours after 4-FA indigestion

&gt;3. Therefor 4-FA is nothing like other halogenated amphetamines.

&gt;4. 4-FA has lesser addictive potential than plain old amphetamine


I was wondering what r/DrugNerds thinks about 4-FA and if it is a safe drug to use recreationaly at moderate doses no more than once every two weeks.

I apologise in advance

My wife tasked me with researching whether there were any diet pills / weight loss supplements that were worth taking. I've done a lot of personal research on recreational substances

I know some of you must have looked into this

To give you more details. My wife has a good track record if keeping her weight once she reaches her target weight. She would therefore like to take a supplement short term to help her reach her target. It's more realistic that she will reduce food intake rather than increase exercise.
An ideal substances would:

1. Promote weight loss in combination with reduced calorie intake. (Either supported by experimental or strong anecdotal evidence)
2. Be safe when taken daily over a period of 2 weeks 
3. Have only mild side effects (be they positive or negative
4. Be relatively well studied or have a history of popular use to minimise the possibility of unknown long term side effects.

Rest assured that I will thoroughly research any substance that you suggest.

I've been wondering about yohimbine. It seems to fit the bill above, and has some [experimental evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1955308) to back up effectiveness.

Abstract

A petroleum ether extract (FP) from Fructus Psoraleae, which, however, had no effect on γ-aminobutyric acid transporter heterogeneously expressed cells and serotonin transporter heterogeneously expressed cells at the concentration up to 100 μg/ml. These inhibitory effects were also confirmed by experiments on SK-N-SH cell line and synaptosomes from rats’ brains. In addition, FP showed a significantly mitigating effect on 1-methyl-4-pyridinium induced injury of D8 cells. Meanwhile, FP dose-dependently reduced the binding of tritium-labeled cocaine analog (−)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane to DAT of D8 cells, which suggests that FP may inhibit DAT activity in the same way as cocaine does. Behavioral study showed FP had a long-lasting stimulant effects on the activity of intact mice and reserpinized mice. So FP is proposed as a kind of DAT and NET inhibitor and may be involved in the process of regulating the DA and NE system, depression



Bakuchiol analogs inhibit monoamine transporters and regulate monoaminergic functions

Abstract

Monoamine transporters play key roles in controlling monoamine levels and modulating monoamine reuptake. The objective of the present study was to identify monoamine transporter inhibitors from herbal sources. We discovered that bakuchiol analogs isolated from Fructus Psoraleae inhibited monoamine transporter uptake to differing degrees. The bakuchiol analog,2-hydroxybakuchiol was more selective for the dopamine transporter (DAT) (IC50 = 0.58 ± 0.1 μM) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) (IC50 = 0.69 ± 0.12 μM) than for the serotonin transporter (SERT) (IC50 = 312.02 ± 56.69 μM). Δ3,2-Hydroxybakuchiol exhibited greater potency (pEC50 for DAT and NET) than bupropion and exhibited similar efficacy (Emax for DAT and/or NET) to bupropion and GBR12,935. Pharmacokinetically, Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol competitively inhibited DAT and NET with partial reversibility and occupied cocaine binding sites. Moreover, Δ3,935. In vivo studies showed that Δ3, especially Δ3, and cocaine addiction.

So i decided to try a small experiment.  I acquired some MDMA powder.  from what i've heard the stuff i have is cut in about half

First attempt was april, and right now. Third attempt with a control subject will be may 18th. 

On the first try, in the morning around 10am. at about  9pm I take 50mg of MDMA.  1 hour later i feel some effects, the ""touch trail"" of amphetamines, and a little uppy but not much.  i went to a club playing some electronic music and couldn't get into it, so at this point i think the stuff is junk. 

Second try today.  I took my meds at 7am on the 6th.  did not re-dose on the meds on the 7th. at 9:20pm i dosed 50mg of MDMA. about an hour later i feel the same as the first time.  but it keeps going.  i peak at 11pm.  i'm not rolling hard, and walked barefoot through the wet grass. it felt awesome!

i'm sure i won't need to update about the effects of the 18th

so yes everyone who told me it would be diminished was very correct!  while i didn't doubt anyone,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,t3_tcgek

1367277193.0,1ddeix,I'm gonna be doing a pretty aggressive taper off of phenibut next week and will try using tianeptine to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Anyone tried this before?,jsimssy,13,4,5,"First

There is some evidence that tianeptine reduces agitation, thus, is not simply a substitute GABA agonist like baclofen. This would cause the GABA system to restore equilibrium faster I believe.

I've been using phenibut 5-6 days a week (1-4 grams per day) for about 2 months and will be doing an aggressive taper next week. My taper plan is to plan out a schedule of ""cheat days"" where I'll take 2 grams throughout the day and then off days where I wont take any. The schedule would look like this: Cheat--off--cheat--off--off--cheat--off--off--off--cheat--etc. until I'm down to one cheat day a week. Basically just continuing to add one day off after every cheat day. The tianeptine I would take on the off days

As a side comment; I highly recommend tapering to anyone who's been using phenibut ""too much"" rather than just going cold turkey. No doctor would advise you to quit benzos or other GABA agonists cold turkey so why some people choose to do that is beyond me. I think most people who feel the withdrawal freak out that they're killing themselves with phenibut so they just want to be done with it. Don't freak out! The last time I came off of phenibut I used the same tapering schedule but only added off days after every other cheat day and it was really not that bad. I'm sure if you extended this to adding off days after every third day it would be very doable.

This is all completely anecdotal evidence

I want to start this with the time dilating effects of cannabis upon myself, because when I am doing things, such as writing a report, reading a book or taking a walk, I get very impatient and anxious, especially when I am by myself and it is something that I have done before.

The cause (occasionally) for this anxiety is my perception of time going slower, instead I am doing things at the same pace as normal, it is just my sense of time which affects my motivation. The slower (and higher) I am, the more I feel smothered by my inability to do things, which is really just my sense of time fucking me up.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, for me, amphetamines actually speed up time. What this means is that while you may actually be doing the same amount of work, it seems just like a shorter amount of time.

My thoughts on this are so: these drugs affect our sense of time (and obviously, such as amphetamines causing a release of dopamine, which is now said to be linked to ‘motivation’) in our ability to perceive time that we feel either productive or unproductive.

We laid a gram total with tabs of one mg. For whatever reason though the tabs didn't work. We reasoned that we were sold the wrong sugar to complex and realized we needed to go another path.

So what we did is wash to tabs with plenty of vinegar several times. This dissolved all the sugar and 25I while at the same time converting it to an acetate salt. Next we added an excess of baking soda and allowed the reaction to fully complete. This freebases the 25I which in turn precipitates it. 

However we still had baking soda precipitated as well. So we filtered the vinegar and then washed all the powder in the filter with water

Of course we will not take any mushrooms (and/or other drugs/alcohol) when we find out she is pregnant or even near ovulation. We thought about it and thought that right at the start of the menstruation cycle (1st day) would be a day of the least risk using mushrooms

Does anyone know whether you risk damaging follicles or growth of the follicles if you take mushrooms on the first day of the cycle? The psilocin/psilocybin should have left the body in 2 to 3 days anyway.

Assume that the rest of the time we won't do any shrooms whatsoever.

Do any of the companies that produce these products try and carefully reproduce the active constituents of tobacco smoke?

Also, given that much of the MAO-A would be occupied in breaking down the melatonin, wouldn't that mean the DMT could be allowed to exist for longer, possibly enough time for it to pass into the cerebrospinal fluid?

Let's say I was to take a moderate therapeutic dose of mushrooms (2.5-3; I usually take 3.5+) tomorrow night (tuesday), I would like to finally test my TMA-6, as I have an ideal day for the long duration. What kinds of problems am I apt to encounter? I know there is some crossover due to the 5HT activity, but I've read that there are few noticeable diminishing effects if the drugs are taken in a short period of time, as long as one is a tryptamine and the other a phenethylamine. Furthermore, the mushrooms will be taken using the lemon tek, which should speed up the metabolization and return to tolerance a bit

Also worth noting that I've been able to take identical doses of mushrooms about 3 days apart,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,t3_wo9jp

(Since I entered college I have increased my drug usage also). However, etc. so there were probably other factors involved. But I want to definitely abstain from the drug usage completely since I know that could be a cause. Are there any ways to make the medication start working as it did in the beginning? I really wouldn't want to have to up my dosage as it would probably cost more and I don't want to put my parents in any more financial debt. I just want to know if changing my habits could help me get back on track? Thanks."

About a year ago I quit xanax after a 2 month binge and definatly went through withdrawl.

Through more repeat benzo binges I have seen this to be a common withdrawl symptom for me. (clean from this terrible chemical now)
