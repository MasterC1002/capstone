Two quick updates:

1) Just to say this again

I have seen a number of good looking reddit apps for Win8 already, and everyone is starting on the ground floor. Even if you have never written an app in your life, Windows 8 is a place were you can do well. I didn't have a whole bunch of experience on Windows Phone when I started making Baconit, but look where it is today. I would strongly encourage anyone thinking about it to give it a shot. :)

Speaking of Win8, PM me and I will send you the details, the API is really simple and easy to use. 

2) If you are experiencing any trouble with BaconSync still


**Edit: These are the Windows 8 Apps I know of thus far. Go support them!**

straight away want to say please don't mind the incredibly long post

I am a new WP user and just got a Lumia 620 10 days back and loving everything about it and the platform. 

Being a redditor Baconit was the obvious choice.

I've been compiling this list since i got the device, or some might not be implementable due to WP or reddit API limitations.  
But still i think i had to share this and apologies for any redundant content.

I am coming from a AlienBlue, due to its long maturation period it has gotten a lot better over the years, Its not a bad thing to take cues from it and improve our own product.

So here it goes. 

*  Custom sub arrangement
*  A White theme 
*  Pocket (formerly Read it Later) support (Custom/pocket web-optimizer/rendered of pages in addition to readability)
* Option to remove items from hidden
* Author flair view (comments on subs like r/soccer can at times be unintelligible because the context gets lost due to the absence of user's club flair)
* Alien Blue Canvas like system
Few standalone apps already do this in WP, etc 
* Flip-view Full screen swiping of stories(something related a bit to the previous point in a way as well)
* Cache cleaning option. 
* Remove(or contract) top bar(and/or bottom) when scrolling through a sub
A possible solution for sub stories scrolling should be implemented for more content to be seen at a single viewing. 
* Comments view improvement
In some accent colors like yellow the color hue and saturation make it easier to follow comments hierarchy than something like blue or cobalt (I think its possibly a OS and color reproduction issue not much fault of the app but I think few tweaks here and there on spacing can make the experience a bit better I think)  
* Comment clicking behavior  
 Why can't we have formatted text(italics
 Additionally Alien Blue even has comment inline image viewing support (able to click/close and see images within the comment view screen)  This could be a WP issues but there has got be a workaround.

* Cant scroll up on comment context view sometimes (this could be a bug and it happens occasionally when going from New messages to new message-reply context screen). 
 Something [like this example ](http://i.imgur.com/o4DZR3n.jpg)

* Unsaving requires manual refresh for story to be removed from on screen view

* Why not Update and look for new messages under the *account* panel while browsing in and out of threads and sub even when *Account information and messages* is set to 1 day(or of such long duration) or Update subreddit stories every 10 min(I am describing my personal custom setting situation for this as example

* Mod module with full functionality as much as Reddit API permits 

* Show the subreddits sidebar options like content, with clickable/copy-able links, that works in smart bar as well, e.g. link of combo subs, etc.

* Laggy performance in app opened web-pages on some pages sometimes (this is very vague from me i know

Few questions 

* What is the *Show top system information bar* option in General settings for?

* Search for- Himalayas (just an example)
go to- a story/thread in r/travel from results
How to go up a level to main r/travel?


Baconit doesn't really have any competition on WP

Before i buy the app i just wanted to give my feedback and listen to what the dev Quinn has to say on the future of the app. 

There are a lot of thing i listed which can be made into a Pro offering of the app as well. 

Things like Mod module support, Full screen Flip-view, Discover Subreddits (Alien Blue like custom list of numerous subs categorized based on context)etc, these features don't break the current usability of the app and thus a app version free of them would still be incredibly effective reddit tool.  

But with them you can offer something extra and people will be willing to pay

It seems that  I can only open up a thread by directly hitting it's title. Or an image that was posted on it. 

It essentially creates a lot of empty space which does nothing on threads which have a short title. 

Would it be possible to somehow enable it in the setting for it to span across the whole line and not just where the text is? 

This is even egregarious on threads which have an image. Since you essentially have an example of a to hit area like this.

It would happen on the initial screen after launch or resuming, and it would actually continue to work just fine, I only had to click through the error while it loaded everything it was supposed to.

However

Now, it no longer loads my account's subreddits, and the Subreddit Manager is useless. I can't check off any subreddits (account or local) on the list (incorrect for my account) that comes up. I can go to Add Subreddit, enter a subreddit name, check off account or local for it, and when hitting the back button it hangs on Loading New Data.

1354212333.0,1405o2,Feature/Option Suggestions for Lock-screen Images.,Algeradd,1,0,0,"First off, most images crop way too much out and you're left with things like a picture of a chunk of the car between the wheels where the entire front and back of the car are cut off.

The first option I've thought of to try and alleviate this is pretty simple.  Allow an option to display the lockscreen image in landscape orientation instead of portrait.  Obviously this isn't very ideal because then you're looking at a landscape image, and if it's closer to a portrait orientation image, display it portrait, if it's closer to landscape, display it landscape.  The downside to that is that it may annoy some people if they keep getting images with a random orientation popping up on their lock screen.

The second option is a little more complex, take a pool of images and look at all of their resolutions.  For each image, use the resolution to calculate the aspect ratio, and then somehow weight all of the potential images by their aspect ratio.  The idea I'm having here is to make it where Baconit favors images that are closer to the 9:16 or 9:15 portrait orientations of the phones than images that are wider.  The big downside I can see to this is if you have to download each image in order to determine its resolution, that's a lot of wasted data as well as processor time just to ultimately display one image.  If it's somehow possible to tell the resolution of an image without fully downloading it though, then it wouldn't be too bad.

Anyway, but more difficult to implement.  Feel free to tell me I'm crazy and nitpicking here, cause I am.  :)",,False,self,t5_2rfk9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/baconit/comments/1405o2/featureoption_suggestions_for_lockscreen_images/
