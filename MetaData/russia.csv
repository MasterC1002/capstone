This is what happened in center of Moscow last night:
[video](http://t.co/HlPdZm1E)
What have started as a small opposition protest against fake elections grew up to 10'000 people marching to elections HQ with omon and police trying to stop them.  
Most of the opposition leaders were arrested and being held in courts.
Official news and tv keeping things silent, lie about the scale of protests, they reduce the numbers of participants and distort the picture in general.  
Some sources report that military has been called to Moscow this morning to calm down the situation.  
Most people doesn't know what is going on
I haven't seen anything like this since 1991 or 1993

1375453112.0,1jkcdz,Why russians care so much about WWII,GingerEly,56,13,79,"A scandal is raising about the game Company of Heroes 2 where the Soviet Army is portrayed as a monstrous horde of cowards and murderers. There is enough posts dedicated to it all over Reddit and in this exact subreddit as well. 

BadComedian did a good job explaining why the game is so insulting

WWII, is the centre of our national self-conscience. It is related to every man.

Winning that fight was an enourmous struggle. Every family contributed its members to the front

That means that when someone is insulting Soviet army he is spitting on the graves of our ancestors. It is not about balancing the 'historical truth' i am not going to deny that war crimes and propagandistic adjustments were made from all the sides of the conflict. It is about the memory and respect for the people of the past.

So I had a Russian friend once

He always told us how adapted Russia was as handling the harsh winters. He would tell us how the winter never really stopped anyone. It never mattered how much snow

Not sure how many actual Russians visit this subreddit, temperature, longevity of snow, etc) as you are will to give. I would love to read your stories.

I agree with a lot of what the author had to say, but if he were charged only with crimes he committed, he would still be in the middle of a heavy sentence. However.....

HE is not in jail because of those crimes (although he should be). He is in jail because of corruption. Corruption is a catastrophe for Russia. It is a major reason that people now want to go into government service instead of building and modernizing the economy in business, so many pulled out (those that were willing to invest always saw it as a high risk adventure, never as a safe bet, and now re-attracting investment form Russians and foreigners to help get Russia out of the krisiz is very difficult), and it is a major reason why there is such unrest and discontent in Russia at the moment.

It is the corruption that makes his case important.  I am less worried about the injustice done to him - as I mentioned above, sends a message to other people in power that it is OK to do the same in their own interests, I am less worried about Khoderkovsky than I am a businessman who is targeted for his assets, an honest political activist targeting corruption targeted to silence their voice and frighten their supporters, as well as for honest people seeking true justice for harm done to them, who cannot get it because they cannot pay for it.

Why, because of corruption. Because people with whom he committed those crimes are still paying for their safety, are still in power enjoying the money they stole, and still hurting ordinary Russians by making a system so unfair they have no incentive to break out of a helpless mentality. Trying Khoderkovsky on such obviously illegal (according to Russian law) measures only supports such people even more.

At the same time, because it strengthens those who wish to support the case against him. It is not a case of the valiant Khoderkovsky standing up against the cruel, always-evil Russian Federation. When Westerners make it about that it makes it easy to avoid the real, difficult topic, that of corruption (complex stories less interesting to readers, hard to prove, ergo easy to be sued over, sometimes requires incriminating their own powerful people). At the same time focusing on the wrong thing makes it easy for those in Russia guilty of weakening their own justice system to defend themselves. These men are also criminals, and instead drum up their support from people such as the author.. If the Western critics are wrong and unfair

I love Russia. I love (some) Russians. I want to see them live honestly, on both sides, but proving Western journalists to be bad at their job does very little. At the most it may hurt individual journalists a little professionally, or even hurt their feelings. Allowing their bad writing to provide an excuse to overlook an issue that is really hurting your country makes Russians the biggest losers in this case. That is supremely unfair.

This is a small subreddit, a lot, and the more coverage I see the more upset I am. I therefore post my humble opinion in the hope of encouraging a little debate beyond Russia/Khoderkovksy is evil/an innocent victim.

Of course, the character was created in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War (which kind of justifies using a name like Natasha for an attractive Russian woman), but I don't think many Western movie makers today have an understanding of Russia before using it in their movies.

My mother in law was a member of the communist party. Her father was a patriotic Soviet citizen and still longs for the U.S.S.R. 

In my discussions with my mother in law, it has been difficult for me to believe her based on what I have been taught about Soviet life. However, in my studies on the topic, I can see how there were plusses and minuses of Soviet life.

Among the best parts of the Soviet system that I can see is: guaranteed employment, free healthcare, very low crime rate, sense of solidarity and pride among citizens.

Among the worst parts of the Soviet system I can see:
Priviledged class of politicians and beurocrats, Xruschovki), Mediocre health care (red tape, lack of supplies, corrupt doctors), very long forced working hours and later on Saturday work in the fields etc, lack of variety of foods in stores, bad quality consumer electronics and consumer goods such as razors

It seems to me that a very good point of Soviet life was the fact that everyone, there would be no booms and busts in the economy and long-term unemployment. You could expect to maintain a standard of living that was not rich, but certainly not very poor by industrialized standards.

I could hold my own in a basic Russian conversation (key word: basic), but more often than not I was super lost and they would keep talking to me in monosyllables. On two separate occasions, I was asked about weed; first time (some apprentice railroad workers) went like ""oh, Kanada? da? hockey? marijuana? hahaha"" and the second time (in a small ghetto cafe on the outskirts of Khabarovsk) the guy actually asked me if I had any.

Huntington defines Russia as the core state of an orthodox civilization. I sometimes wonder how the Russians see themselves being positioned between the Western Civ to the west, who would the Russians prefer to ally themselves with? I of course suspect it would be the West (similar religious ties, much shared history over the past 400 years as well as many cultural bonds) but since my knowledge of modern day Russia is fairly limited, I really couldn't tell.

I have a lot of specific questions on two general topics: history and minorities. Any information is helpful; if you're not Russian by birth but you've lived in the country long enough to have some insight, tell me where you were born and how long you've been in Russia.

**HISTORY**

1. How do Russians feel about their history and about their monarchist and communist past?

2. There are monuments all over St Petersburg and Moscow. How connected is the average Russian with the history of his/her country? 

3. How does the prevalence of historical monuments affect the way that Russians think about their present and future?

4. How has Russian geography helped determine Russian history – in terms of Russia's neighbors, wars, etc?

------------------

**MINORITIES**

1. How do Russians feel about foreigners and minorities in their country?

2. To what degree do the following influence the Russians' opinion of minorities?:

&gt; * the minority's grasp of Russian culture

&gt; * the minority's fluency in the Russian language

&gt; * what profession the minority holds in Russia

* It has to be a modern day film

* Preferably about young adults or teenagers

* It has to be in an everyday setting

I'm a Russian major, and spent five weeks there. Our teacher was usually with us when we had to exchange money, or had to help us take care of things we didn't know how to do on our own. I went shopping and things on my own however. 

That being said, my knowledge in the language did not really expand much.

My point is, I have no more courses involving learning Russian. I am trying to get into medical school, but if that doesn't work out, I obviously need to use my degree as a back up. I'd love to teach English in Russia, but their political system is worse than the US, and the lack of good medical care and my lack of knowledge in Russian is worrying me.

I could probably get a translation job here, it is possible to become fluent here in America, without staying a specific amount of time in Russia?

Firstly, as well as just appropriate clothes to bring regarding weather, etc? On a more specific note, what should I be wearing to class every day? I've read that class decorum in Russia is considerably higher than in the States, and that entails dressing more nicely, but how nicely are we talking here? Does this mean, ""Don't wear tattered and messy clothes and tennis shoes,"" or ""Dress like you're having an important business meeting every day""? 

Secondly, and the person believed the government was restricting his Internet access to things like email until he stopped and read things like the online English edition of Правда instead. This person had basically no concrete evidence to prove this, and I generally believe that stories about the government censoring free news is restricted mostly to reporters and journalists rather than the everyday people, but is a real thing in Russia? 

Thirdly, cultural norms to adhere to, etc., that you wouldn't typically find in a guidebook, or a source to read up on this kind of information? I've read three different guidebooks on Moscow and several smaller online sources for this kind of information, and I've talked to a few different native Russians I know over here, so I have a pretty good idea I believe. 

One more thing - clubs and bars, of course with fellow students and people I know through mutual acquaintances. Also any advice about bars and clubs would be nice, and is it worth it to try to meet Russian women? I know how gorgeous seemingly all of them (under the age of 50) appear to be, but the stats on STDs, HIV, and lack of condom use kind of scare me. Anyways, thanks for tolerating another post from a clueless American - Большое спасибо!

&gt; There's no sense in dreaming about replacing ""corrupt rulers with honest ones"". It's just walking in a circle; the mentality of slaves that believe in good and evil kings. The free people's mentality is expressing itself in that they design and build systems

&gt; That's why the only thing that, where the people don't historically crave for strong kings) is replacing the heavy, bribe-capacious legislative systems with light, transparent ones.

&gt; I don't believe in honest politicians (that's an oxymoron)

&gt; I don't believe in unbiased appointed judges; I believe in the principles of jury courts and elected people's judges. I don't believe in big un-stealable state budgets; I believe in budgets of such a size, in which there would be no reasons to give bribes to these officials. The latter may happen if the legislative system will suddenly start eliminating potentially corruptable regulations, licenses and checks for private initiatives.

And the current situation in Russia (I'm not talking about the homophobic laws right now.) seems to agree with that.

We have a universal health care system

We have strict gun laws

According to the World Bank,418. The country is literally third world. Russia's economy has been growing rapidly the past decade and in spite of the recent slowdown its huge reserves of natural resources is bound to see it continue growing into the future. The megacity of Moscow is invaluable and potentially an incredibly strong economic engine, something Ukraine could never have anything close to on its own.

Russia's fertility rate

I know many in Ukraine are looking towards Europe, no. 

Russia, after all, a federation; the infrastructure is already there. Ukraine would be given tons of autonomity within Russia and it's culture is very similar to the Russian culture compared to many of the other cultures found within the federation.

Ukraine, Odessa, for example. Also Donetsk, L'viv and Dnipropetvorsk. Not to mention Crimea. Ukraine has the potential to become a very popular holiday destination and it's low prices could help it steal western tourists from Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Croatia etc. Not to mention Russia would get control of the oil pipelines running through Ukraine and thus avoid future problems relating to that. And Ukraine could stop worrying about buying hydrocarbons from Russia. Also

If Ukraine was merged into Russia it would give the federation a collective population of almost 190 million. Add Belarus to that and we're at 200 million

It seems like Ukraine's future would look better as part of Russia. Right now the country does in fact seem doomed. Will Ukrainian's die a very proud people or swallow said pride for a possibly brighter future with Russia? To me

Also, especially if we promised Nagorno Karabakh autonomy) and Azerbaijan (the fact that they wouldn't like it would only make the annexation that much more enjoyable) to that and you would get a shared border with Iran, as well!

Are there some  ""do's and don'ts"" to respect when dealing with russian companies ?  
What are the main focus while doing business with russians ?  
Is it really important for the product to be built in Russia or are they open for products build outside russia ?

I'm a Russian major

Vocabulary is never a problem, the cases and their uses continue to be a problem for me, especially genitive, because of how many things it is used for, including numbers.

What is the best way to work on memorizing their uses and endings? Flash cards don't seem to help; there's too much information on each case. I know most of the basics
