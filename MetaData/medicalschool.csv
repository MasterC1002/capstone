    There are some things I want to tell you now
know how much I'll change by the time we meet
I won't be the same person I was a decade before I met you
That's life
coming from and what you mean to me. I also write this so that I can remind myself. I'm human


     Contrary to what you may believe,000
 in debt by the time I graduate medical school and have already amassed ~$20
during the first few years of my training. I accrue ~$40 in interest a day and when I finally start making my 
modest residency salary next year
this field because it was the perfect combination of my academic interests (science
the ability to really make a difference in people's lives.  I wanted not only to be able to identify your MI and 
activate the cath lab for you when you come in anxious, but to be
 able to hold your hand when your scan shows a return in your cancer and that unfortunately
 abdominal organs.


    To begin my training,  a 
relationship
 nights up into the wee hours of the morning learning about cellular pathways
different class I antiarrhythmics
trying to remember which one presented with hepatosplenomegaly. During the month before my first board 
exam, and markers, sometimes literally sleeping on 
my review materials
invited me out to do leisurely things
 and the USMLE World question bank.


     After having a less than two week summer
 the second 7 hour exam of my life
going to be able to practice the things I learned in textbooks. I took out an appendix my first month as a third 
year, was
 able to diagnose episcleritis from a physical exam
jaundiced man's belly. I even circumsized a baby. It was fascinating to see many of the things I read about 
manifested on people
meant it was someone's actual glioblastoma or that a stroke can just come and devastate someone who had 
been witnessed as ""fine"" a few hours prior to arrival.


      Life at the hospital was not quite as I expected it. I sat through an end-of-life discussion
my patient was told that he had no further options for chemotherapy/radiation and my attending was pressuring this clearly stunned man into making a hospice decision within the span of about 15 minutes. I heard cynical remarks from people not too ahead of me in training, finishing charting at home, and then waking up sometimes as early as 03:00 the following day to do it all over again. I often worked my tail off, too, but due to subjectivity of third year grading, ended up with lower remarks than say a classmate who played the same sport in high school as our resident or a fellow student who spent his weekends playing LOL like the attending.


     Outside of the hospital, high school or college classmates were 
posting pictures of newly bought houses
notices seemed to be a weekly occurrence. Life was moving forward for everyone else around me
was kind of frozen for the time being
 complete families
were all things I was jealous of and did not have. In fact
 down invites to hang out or for small get togethers
medical school mostly at the hospital
 meeting a friend a year ahead of me at a different school whom I could relate to about things
ensued fast in the months leading up to him leaving
 gods) brought him to a far away place for residency. And I was devastated.


     To my future patient: this has been a very disheartening week. I've questioned my decision to go to medical
 school many times this year, 
anxious about the future
family so much and there are so many feelings that I keep inside because I don't want to worry my mom. She's
 busy enough with my other siblings and I know she would just feel badly that she was far away and ""unable to 
help"". The truth is that having her has been provided me with more than she will ever know.


    Despite all the seemingly only negative thoughts I have poured out onto the screen and the general feeling of
 uncertainty I possess as I enter my final year of medical school
 me for 15 minutes
reassure a tearful you that everything will be perfectly fine when your infant comes in with a febrile seizure. I 
may help you figure out why you constantly get the fluorescent
provide you with comfort as we wait for you to recover from transverse myelitis. One thing is for certain: 
human beings are incredibly resilient creatures and I am amazed by the drive
devastating news delivered by a stranger in a white coat. Yes
 harder
 recover from illness
into your hospital room and get to talk to you about your troubles


    But I'm also human and everything you feel, if ever you see me not smiling as widely as
 I should be, 
please at least try to understand that I have my own life stressors and that I struggle to hold my own life 
together in my quest to make yours better. Please let me know that I need to be better because sometimes it
 gets overwhelming and I may, 
arduous journey that I took off on even years before medical school started



Sincerely


Your doctor

1329668434.0,pwimn,A few questions about the direction of r/medicalschool,FactorGroup,97,16,51,"Hey guys and gals

I'm a pretty active poster here on r/medicalschool

9 of the links posted are by premeds asking questions about how to get in

2 links are someone (I assume a lay person) asking about medical problems.

8 links are memes

3 links are helpful study materials for medical students.

3 links are posts by medical students asking questions to other medical students.

Now, I think it might be best to amend the sidebar and purpose of this sub. Whenever I come to [/r/medicalschool](/r/medicalschool), I want to read about and talk to other med students about being in med school. I don't know how all the other medical students on here feel, but I don't have to worry about whether or not my GPA is high enough, or what to do to prepare for the new MCAT, or how I can set up volunteering, and I hate having to wade through a bunch of premed posts to find the content on this sub that I'm actually interested in.

I'm not against helping out premeds who have questions or want to know what it's like, and I try to answer questions over on premed pretty frequently, but I think it would be nice to be able to filter the content a little more effectively.

Obviously, then I've got no room to complain. [Here is a thread from about a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/nmoqd/the_reasons_why_i_am_unsubscribing_from_this/c3aaxfb) discussing this same topic, in which several subscribers felt the same way. I hope the mods will also weigh in on this and let us know how they feel about it.

So

- Wears scrubs in public to show off
- I've done well on some exams
- Takes anatomy practical...WTF WAS THAT SHIT?
- Sinks into a major depression
- Slowly recovers over the summer but realizes how bored I am without school and actually look forward to going back

Year 2

- Starts pathology and pharmacology
- Becomes a hypochondriac
- Realizes that most diseases have no cure and becomes disillusioned with the profession
- But overall more interesting
- Crams like mad for Step 1
- Learns more from USMLE World than during two years of school
- Does well on Step 1 and feels rejuvenated and excited about his future

Year 3

- First rotation: Feels so hopelessly ignorant and awkward. All confidence gained in first two years is totally shattered. Takes first Shelf exam
- Second rotation: Attending treats me and resident like shit. Everyone's unhappy. Weather gets cold. Starts to hate his life once again.
- Third rotation: Alright. More of the same. Dreads working on the wards.
- Fourth rotation: Is there no end in sight? Why are these rounds taking so long!
- Fifth rotation: OMG

4th year

- No more Shelf exams? It can't be, step 2. Painfully wades through USMLE World once again. Yep, I am truly dumb. Confidence is shattered once again.
- Sub-internship: Hmm
- Avoids wearing white coat whenever possible
- Hopes no one asks him what he does because he doesn't want to talk about medical school

Before I start

The AAMC has an AWESOME resource called AAMC FIRST. 99% of your questions on medical school financing can be found here. Topics extend to long PDFs to concise 40 minute powerpoints on just how it all works. I spent about a week combing the website. 

Here is the [link](https://www.aamc.org/services/first/)

Now, the MORE specific you are, the better it is. I have something like this in mind:

Cost of Attendance: $__________ (tuition plus living expenses. Elaborate if you feel the need to)

Loan breakdown (if applicable): 

*Stafford: $_________ at 6.8% APR

*Grad PLUS: $_________ at 7.9% APR

*Private: $________ at _____% APR from (bank name/lender)

*Scholarship (if applicable): $_________

*Out of Pocket (and how

Any other details you think are relevant!

I'll get you all started. FIU Med here.

COA: $65

Stafford: $42000 at 6.8% (I think I'll be accepting this)

Grad plus: 0

Private: $7

Scholarship: $5k/year

OUP: $10k

Location: Graz
Me: M

So in Austria you enter med school after highschool. That means 18 for  most girls

It lasts **12** semesters (6 years)

**Admission:** You have to pass a test in July which is a combination of science (biology, dental, nursing, doctoral students combined) You start in october.

**Curriculum:** Every year you have 6 modules (3 per semester). A module lasts usually about 5 weeks. After that module there is the main date for the ""module-exam"" which is multiple choice most of the time. Lectures are optional

The first and second semester are preclinical. Chemistry, biochemistry, embryology, histology and stuff. Third semester is biochem and physiology. Fourth semester is pathology, pathophysiology and pharmacology. This is **by far** the hardest one. After that you have clinical modules. In every modules you have different disciplines mixed up. M29 for example is ENT and dermatology, M14 is radiology combined with statistics, M23 is orthopedics and traumasurgery.

During the first five years you have to do 16 weeks of rotations in specialties of your choice. (you can do 16 weeks of psychiatry

6th year is purely clinical

You have to write a thesis to finish you study.

**Finances:**Yeah, because politics. So usually you leave med school w/o any debts.

I would be interested how your system is (you don't have to write as much as I did

Are you okay with people responsibly using these types of drugs? Do you use them? What drugs do you think are okay for people to use? Do you think more research should be done on these compounds? 

Responsible use is key here. I'm not talking about smoking weed everyday or taking mushrooms on a weekly basis. I recognize there is a problem here with a definition for 'responsible use.' I am also not saying that people cannot get carried away and end up with a substance use disorder. That certainly exists and those people have a problem. I also think that people with a psychiatric history or a family history of psychiatric disorders should not be using these substances. I am not talking about cocaine or heroin or other highly addictive and damaging substances. 

I have found that in my school there are very few students who are actually educated about these types of drugs. The attendings and the residents even less so. To me it is a very interesting topic,False,,t5_2re2p,1349132709.0,,,t3_10sacm

I attribute this to the fact that I only study the main concepts and facts -- the big picture -- only the things I expect to see on STEP 1. I just can't force myself to learn anything that I feel will be irrelevant in my future career. And those students at the very top seem to memorize every little irrelevant detail in the notes. And often those details happen to be the professor's research focus. I feel like having a solid grasp on the main concepts and facts will not put me at disadvantage when taking STEP 1,,

1. AOA says we want some of our core competencies retained if we do agree on one system. ACGME is cool with it.
2. Talks continue
3. AOA rejects the MOU. Talks are halted.

Does anyone have an insight on whether or not this is going to get done? I understand the AOA is big on carrying this distinction of being a DO... but I'm concerned that osteopathic medical students are constantly getting screwed on the decisions they are making. If talks end here

A few studies have shown that the prevalence of psychological distress among medical students before the onset of medical training was similar to general population. This study aimed to investigate psychological health of medical students before and during medical training. A one-year prospective study was done on successful applicants who undergo the first year of medical training for 2010/2011 academic session. The stress, four months (Time 2), six months (Time 3) and final examination (Time 4) of the first year medical training. The prevalence of unfavourable stress, anxiety and depression before the onset of medical training was 4.1%, 55.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The prevalence of unfavourable stress during medical training ranged between 11.8% and 19.9%. The prevalence of anxiety during medical training ranged between 41.1% and 56.7%. The prevalence of depression during medical training ranged between 12% and 30%. Mean scores of stress and depression before (Time 0) and during medical training (Time 1–4) were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence and level of unfavourable stress and depression during medical training were significantly higher than before the onset medical training.

Currently, due to these problems, I’ve missed quite a number of days. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to get some letters of recommendation, but I’ve squandered it. 

So not only do I feel like I have screwed myself over even as far as applications go

I’ve talked with student affairs in the past; they seem mostly interested in confirming that I am not suicidal (I’m not) and then refer me to a psychiatrist. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 years now, this may be the worst possible time to take a leave of absence. Additionally, I’m not sure what taking time off would accomplish.

I guess my questions are: Is it impossible for me to be or even become a doctor? Have I kissed my chances at having an acceptable application goodbye? Has anyone else dealt with major depression or sleep disorders through medical school? How did they challenge you

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and concern, and the clerkship director is keeping these issues between us. I have to say, everything has worked out better than I thought it would. I was surprised at the understanding that everyone showed. Still, I have to focus on getting better--I've agreed to meet with a therapist on a regular basis (something I'd not been doing before) and I have a new appointment with a psychiatrist to adjust my meds.

I went to a relatively easy college. Didn't focus much on school but it was an easy school so I managed a 3.73 cumulative. Took the MCAT after graduation, writing and math learning disabilities and ADHD. Major deficiency were processing speed and verbal long term memory. I don't know if I really do have LDs, but that's what the psychoeducational assessment concluded.

School allowed me to retry. For midterms got 2 Bs and failed the third exam. A lot of the stuff in the first half I was somewhat familiar with but since midterms everything is very new to me and it almost all seems like a blur. Ive made some drastic changes recently and I think I will be able to correct the mistakes I've made (yet again.)

Its just so frustrating to study and then not remember enough the next day. To have other students blow you off or roll their eyes during group times or have smirks on their face as they pass you in the hall. But thats okay. I see other kids talk about material week after week with ease and I'm just sitting there trying to follow.

2) Like the article says GYM GYM GYM. It relieves stress and provides you the body you need to carry on.

3) Try different studying techniques early on, I suppose it depends on the class/professor.

4) Delete Facebook and stop going on Reddit. My reasoning for this is; you won't procrastinate as much and you'll be more efficient in your studies. Because truthfully

5) Enjoy what you study, guess how I end up studying anatomy...

6) Treat yourself at least twice a month. This may mean drinking, whatever. My personal thing was to smoke a lot of cigarettes, hookah, and play fifa with some other students for 10 hours.

7) Try and not make any enemies with your peers. You're stuck with them for the next few years. 

8) If you're an MBBS student like me

9) Do not hesitate in asking, a fellow redditor, or the janitor on campus. ASK QUESTIONS when you have something on your mind.

I have tried to organize movie plans, other hangouts

To make matters worse, and the break up was amicable, but I still got depressed because she was pretty much the only person I was talking to on a regular basis. On the plus side, I was proud of myself to maintain my average grades in the face off heartbreak. 

I now am trying to find other girls that I could befriend and possibly become intimate with, and to be honest, that is who I am attracted to. But the thing is, my school is small, not many girls of my race get accepted a year (maybe 1-2, but often 0) and the girls are typically are 3-4 years older than I am (I am 21 and my classes average age is 24-25.

For someone in Thailand, Vietnam, Qatar, Jordan, or wherever to have all of their relatives nearby, believe that family is the most important thing in the world, make it into medical school, but spend at least a year studying for arbitrary American tests full-time for the sole purpose of coming here and staying?  And applying for the J-1 visa, but also for Step 2 CS because of possible accent issues?

Holy crap

 **For those of you who weigh lifestyle as an important factor in YOUR future choice of specialty

Some factors to consider:

- Total hours worked per week: Do you want to work 80 hours per week? 60? 20?

- Shift mentality vs round-the-clock commitment: Do you care that when you leave work

- Flexibility of time off: Do you need to be able to take off for weeks at a time and feel confident that your patients are being taken care of?

- Intraday flexibility: Do you value the ability to set your own pace throughout the day

- Circadian factors: Daylight work hours only? Or are graveyard shifts OK.

As a student in the UK its hard to grasp this concept.  Sure in the UK some patients may prefer to see a clinician of their own faith or ethnicity but a doctors credibility would not come into question just for being an atheist.

With the complement system's Classical pathway the books vary. I'm not sure which is the newest (they both give 2011 print dates) and I need something cleared up.

So when the C1qr2s2 complex forms it catalyses the breakdown of C4 and C2 into C4a+ and C2a+b. I get this bit but one edition says the C3 convertase in the classical pathway is

C4b2a where as the other says C4b2b.

I just started studying for the Step 1 with plans to take it in June/July. I have the newest 2013 copy of First Aid in a 3 inch binder. I'm trying to stick to key resources because I find anymore can become a distraction (E.g. First Aid, Kaplan Qbank, etc.).

I'm particularly confused about Pathology. During the school year, but mostly avoided it since I enjoyed Pathoma more.

Now that I'm sitting down to study for the Step

Having already gone through Pathoma and marked up my Rapid Review book and made it an excellent Path resource - I'm now listening to Goljan audio with First Aid open and Rapid Review open next to it - and I find myself drawn to annotating First Aid with Goljan's lectures. The key points from each Pathology are already in First Aid, but I mean First Aid does leave out some details from RR. For example, when discussing Aortic Aneurysms, it's mentioned in RR in the small blue wording the clinical manifestations, while this isn't mentioned at all in First Aid. 

Basically, I'll just make the book a bloated resource with extraneous info not necessary for the exam. On the other hand, I see First Aid as just a resource with just enough points with no tying them together so I feel it necessary to annotate and explain.

http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Pages/acgme-frequently-asked-questions.aspx

**UPDATE:**

Student FAQs - ACGME Unified Accreditation

Posted Nov. 9
**Many programs still do not know what to make of the unified accreditation system. How will the AOA and ACGME educate the residency and fellowship directors about this new system and how it will impact their programs?**
There will be many stakeholders in the entire process, ACGME and AACOM have been very communicative with each other and involved stakeholders. All organizations plan to continue this process to ensure all are receiving timely information as it becomes available.

**When will MD students be able to apply to DO residencies? Will this take place in 2015 or later?**
We anticipate the unified accreditation process will take place in July 2015. At that time

**Who will issue board certifications? The AOA or the ABMS?**
As it stands

**Will those already training in ACGME accredited programs at the time of the merger
We anticipate yes.

**How will the AOA accredited programs address the training of MD interns/residents?**
It will be a matter of time and discussion to see how allopathic residents can meet osteopathic principles and practice competencies. 

**Does this mean that trainees entering residency in 2013 and 2014 will be graduating from a ""unified accreditation"" program?**
Yes

**What does the implementation of this new unified system mean for osteopathic specialty colleges?**
Osteopathic specialty colleges will always provide valuable services, professional networking and advocacy.  When the unified system goes into effect, we anticipate the specialty colleges will play a role in the development of educational standards and milestones for osteopathic-focused residency programs, including representation on the residency review committees.

**What will happen to AOA residency programs that are unable to meet ACGME requirements?**
When the unified system goes into effect

Both the AOA and ACGME understand  the need for more GME positions.  The decision to enter into an agreement to pursue a unified accreditation system was not entered to weed out poor programs

**Although there are many details still to be determined
With the new system

**As we move toward a unified accreditation system
As things stand

**Is there potential for this agreement to fall apart?**
We are extremely optimistic about this process moving forward. The agreement we are working on

**How will the COMLEX exam play into the application process for GME? Will the osteopathic focused programs still require the COMLEX score?**
COMLEX-USA will continue to be the required examination series and the pathway to licensure for osteopathic physicians. It is widely recognized and universally accepted as the valid examination for osteopathic physician competency assessment for licensure. It is also required by accreditation standards established by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA)

**What, proctology, etc? Should students be hesitant to enter such specialties?**
This will be addressed in AOA discussions with ACGME, we have had discussions with ACGME about developing a Residency Review Committee for NMM, specifically, since none currently exists for that specialty area.

**Does this mean that MD students can now learn OMM?**
MDs were never prohibited from learning OMM.  Many of our schools offer CME in osteopathic manipulative medicine

**When new programs do open
This issue is under discussion.  We do not yet know the details of how each program and its details will be presented

I took a vacation to do some soul searching, and I figured out I had to work in an ever-evolving industry that also involved helping people. After months of thinking I decided I had to become a doctor, and now I am waiting to hear back from a bunch of post bacc programs. Very exciting!
