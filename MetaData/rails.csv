Not really sure whether to focus on front-end and back-end development (since I want to learn enough of both to become dangerous, &amp; frameworks out there

I'm fascinated by several types of apps:

1) Business-focused SaaS apps that offer great functionality to small business

2) Lightweight, etc) and mainly use JSON objects pulled from external (and my own) APIs. JS MV* frameworks like Backbone, Ember, &amp; Knockout have caught my eye lately.

3) Real-time/nearly real-time apps that involve lots of small pieces of data flying around at any given time (i.e. Stackoverflow, and that style of ""Javascript all around"" REALLY appeals to me, especially since web development is moving more towards JS for everything these days.

I've spent the last few weeks digging into RoR and (coming from vanilla PHP) there are lots of things I like about it, I could definitely appreciate it, but I'm focused on small apps right now.

From what I understand, then gradually learn more back-end development to build my own APIs.

I really appreciate more experienced web developers' feedback. This field is so exciting right now, I'd like to focus on a stack that's going to provide me with a nice base skillset to build my career upon.

Thanks again in advance!

I'd like to fully grasp these concepts so my head doesn't hurt anymore.

I'm used to dealing with an ORM like active record. When I imagine my user objects through rails I picture an object of a person being related to a row in the people table. Ok basic.

So

1) What are some fundamental examples of relational design and non-relational design? 2) similar to above

So

How about something describing something less typical.

Let's say I was building a workout tracker app. I have users, routines and log_entries.

I create a routine to group workouts. A workout is a group of exercises. I record my reps and weight through log entries for my exercises. Is this relational data or non relational? Would mongo be great for modeling this or awful?

I hear things like statistics come into play. How does that affect the above example? What statistics are people usually speaking of?

Let's say I added tracking other things, body fat and so on. How does that affect things?

Thank you for taking the time to help me understand.

Edit: can anyone explain why it may be easier to develop for one over the other. Is using something like mongo more agile both because it ""clicks"" more once you ""ge it"" and also because you don't need to run migrations?

I am a long time coder that has been hoarding all the source I have worked on since the late 90s. Maintaining these backups is becoming rather laborious in my ever increasingly shorter life so I've decided to release all my Ruby on Rails applications to the public.

List of applications:

*RecipeTrees* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/recipetrees)

RecipeTrees is a recipe database but with a twist: a user can clone/fork (yes

*Parlmnt* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/parlmnt)

Parlmnt scrapes Bills and Legislation information from [Parliament.uk](http://parliament.uk) and presents it in a more debatable manner. Secondary objective is to provide scrapped data via a JSON/XML api. This is mostly a Backbone.js application with the Rails acting as nothing more than an API server with all rendering being done via Backbone views and DustJS. Still coding but is in early alpha. Helpers welcome.

*MediaCMS* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS)

My first Rails project started in 2006! I continued hacking on it till early 2010. MediaCMS is a full blown commercial media library supporting: photo/video/audio uploads with background process that convert from pretty much any format to required format for viewing and playback. Several e-commerce mechanisms available for media up-loaders (i.e. price per image size

*DarkFallSage* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/DarkFallSage)

DarkFallSage is a mapwow.com type website aimed at the DarkFall MMO. Interesting features include: custom Google Maps tiles that use the game world map to overlay loot/mob information; mob/loot database; support for clans to manage own public/private forums; skill trees; discussions on each game item/skill. Stopped coding in 2010.

*Waster* - aka TheLastBunker.com - [source](https://github.com/nazar/wasters)

Wasters, considered by many to be SW Galaxies spiritual successor in terms of its crafting mechanism. Wasters was developed to primarily catalogue crafted items, not too dissimilar from the Bill of Materials shipping problem. I re-invented the wheel on this one by figuring out the Materialised Path pattern in order to model all the assemblies. Stopped coding in 2010.

I hope these are useful

Live long and prosper.

-Needs a lot of maintenance?

Heroku
-More expensive (I think?)
-Very easy to deploy(I think?)
-I don't really understand dynos and why they are a better alternative

Basically I just have a little portfolio I wanted to upload which I think would suit Heroku perfectly as I wouldn't expect much traffic and could probably survive on the free dyno. With that said I'd eventually like to maybe offer my limited skills on a freelance basis and wasn't sure which was the best route to go.

What Ryan (the guy behind railscasts) has done is simply amazing

Ryan started asking $9/mo for ""Pro"" subscribers. New episodes are now typically for said subscribers though some free ones will likely remain to be produced. 

I'm sure for many

When I was laid off last year, i can't justify $9/mo when i still struggle to keep my bank account in the positive. (I also don't like 'what was once free is now paid', and prefer a more reddit-like model where you just get extra on top and pay because you want to support)

This isn't to say that i would never pay **A** monthly fee, which is simply untrue. 

~

(TL;DR) So with that in mind... here's what i'm curious about

* If you don't pay for $9/mo for railscasts
* At what point would it be too much for you? (i.e. $10/mo
* If you were asked to asses the value of an episode after watching it, how would that impact what you're willing to pay?

~

In the end


**Edit:** a few people seem to be missing the point. I'm asking what you would pay. Clearly his stuff is of value... how much

** Edit: ** Ryan will still be producing a free one weekly. Some redditors take issue with my ""what was once free is now paid"" blip... should not at all be the take away from this post.

The client has become increasingly irritated about the bugs and I reply by practically pleading for him to let us take even a few days to write out even some very high level tests to catch the low hanging fruit. He consistently says no.
His answer is that he believes that the architecture of the site must be bad since modifying one part of the site (which might involve an addition to a model) can cause a bug in another part of the system. He thinks it's bad architectural design because the code for each part of the system is not isolated from the other parts. He is a business guy and not a programmer.

        format.json { render json: blah }
      end

into its own method within the application controller for the @60% of cases where it suffices. I'm sat here now going over the views

Better scaffolding (e.g. haml by default) would have helped immensely

1363654390.0,1ak942,Help debugging RAILS apps.,YesNoMaybe,9,2,12,"I come from a C++ background

I've been getting into Ruby on Rails for a few months now and I have a decent handle on it - no problems with the Ruby language or the conventions of Rails - but every now and then I run into a problem and am just not comfortable enough to debug it. I end up searching Google for answers and usually can get past it that way

The problem, I'm asking for some guidance.

**What do I do when it doesn't work** and there is no exception with feedback pointing me to the problem.

For example
**./app/views/entries/show.html.erb:**

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;div id=""comments""&gt;
        &lt;%= render @entry.comments %&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;%= form_tag :action =&gt; :add_comment
        &lt;p&gt;
          Comment: &lt;%= text_area_tag :body %&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
          &lt;%= submit_tag ""Add Comment""
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

Then

**./app/contollers/entries_controller.rb:**
    
    class EntryController &lt; ApplicationController
      respond_to :json
    
      def add_comment
    	@entry = Entry.find(params[:id])
    
        @comment = @entry.comments.create(:body =&gt; params[:body])
    
        respond_with @comment do |format|
          format.js
        end
      end
    end
    
Assume everything works up through the action and the comment gets created in the list of comments for the entry. I have no problem debugging and refining the model because I can use the interactive ruby console.

Let's say by some dumb mispelling or something I don't have the script in the right place or I've mispelled the filename or something: the script I want to respond with from add_comment to dynamically update the view doesn't work. Here's where I'm not sure where to go. *Keep in mind

More details:

My experience is limited.  I've forked the project and have made some minor changes to the application and the database structure (e.g. messed around with some active record validations, etc.).  I haven't struggled too much, but items on my to-do list are becoming a bit more difficult.  I have looked at a few Rails guides (guides.rubyonrails.org, why's poignant guide) but my learning stops there.

This application isn't huge

We're having performance issues with the application.  Currently, especially once we get clients.  The third party is working to resolve these performance issues.  Their goal is to make it so we can pass a security vulnerability test (SQL injection, XSS, and whatnot) provided by yet another company.  Interestingly, our rails app crashes under load from one concurrent connection from the testing servers.  That doesn't make me comfortable either.

This application also stores information that falls under HIPAA.  Just one more reason for me to be worked up.

One of my friends also cleverly pointed out that I work for an internet company that has only one web developer/sysadmin/knowledgable computer person.  That's me.  (Less than a dozen work here.)

I work with very large game studios that you've definitely heard of, and pick your brains as far how I could do my job better, and rather than be annoying, be as helpful as possible, which is truly the approach I try and take.

Personally, and am usually just plain curious as to hear what kind of projects people are working on and see when they might consider start looking for a new job - usually very casual conversations, basically shoot the breeze with the talent I reach out to. I try and figure out what makes them tic, and if something comes across my desk that might be of interest to them, I'll reach out and let them know. I hated when recruiters would call me and try to shove a job down my throat, so I've pretty much taken the exact opposite approach.

So yeah, or are in the space already, and are trying to advance in you careers (specialty of mine, if I might say so, getting talent compensation/title increase) PM me and we can take it from there.

This is a question that has been bothering me for a *very* long time.

Say I have a basic CRUD Rails app that tracks inventory.  What is the best practice for arbitrarily defining metadata or information about an instance of a item?

This might be better explained with an example:

Say I create a category or item type for ""Pumps"".  I want the user to be able to add in multiple Pumps.  They might have to fill out fields for ""flow rate""

But then I might have a item type for ""Generators"".  They might enter in multiple generators that have required fields for ""voltage""

The admin interface would allow creation of these item types and what fields they will have.

How can I best structure my models to allow this sort of dynamic behavior?  I surely don't want to create a model/table for each item type.

* create models for users and petitions
* create roles =&gt; a user can be leader
* create a compaign model =&gt; a compaign contains multiple petitions
* create authentication system using a gem
* add Facebook authentication support
* add Twitter authentication support
* create basic layout
* create basic views
* create an administration panel for leaders
* create a emailing system to keep you users informed
* Think about a ranking system to distinguish the activity between users
* create charts to see how petitions are progressing

1320261198.0,ly0br,Integration with legacy ASP.NET Application - Authentication Question?,akira410,8,0,9,"I have recently been tasked with rewriting an ASP.NET (VB) Application in rails.

Unfortunately

Due to the fact that there are a lot of various applications/tools used in the office that still point to the database

That's resolved easily enough with the proper gems and liberal use of views and/or alias_attribute commands. 

However, aspnet_Roles, aspnet_userInRoles, etc. 

I have managed to write the roles up to the user account but I can't seem to figure out the most appropriate way to hook up the authentication.

Here's where things get weird:


    Table:
    client_Data  
    
    Columns: client_Num(autoinc PK), etc.

    Table:
    aspnet_Users  (part of Forms Auth)
    Columns: UserID (the GUID from above)

    Table:
    aspnet_Membership  (parts of FOrms Auth)
    Columns: USerID (GUID)

So, a Users table which maps a non-primary-key but unique GUID field to a username, and then a Membership table that links the same GUID with a password.

I can ghetto code this into working

My current thought on the solution to the problem is a class method on the User class called 'authenticate' which will accept a username and a password.  This method will then query the database with a three table join (or a custom view) to determine if the username/password combination is correct.  If so

I'm not really sure if that's the best way to go about it


		def authenticate(username
		    User.joins(""inner join aspnet_Users on aspnet_Users.UserID = client_Data.UserID"").joins(""inner join aspnet_Membership on aspnet_Membership.UserID = client_Data.UserID"").where([""aspnet_Users.username = ? AND aspnet_Membership.password = ?""
		end

Not related but does anyone run RoR on windows 8? I'm using instant rails so it makes things easier but I haven't gone in dept about it. So far it's not as easy as using it on linux.

This seemed simple enough at first. Have an array of characters, you have a test string. But as I thought about it more, I wanted to include all UTF-8 characters in the test. And then, even more, I want to test all input, not just valid characters.

I finally realized that this question is really about Fuzz testing rather than simple random strings. This led me to find [**FuzzBert**](https://github.com/emboss/FuzzBert).

I'm creating a web application and I have the following situation involving mainly 3 different models:

- **User**: this is a very simple model. It stores authentication information: email and password
- **Employee**: details like Name FamilyName, Gender, etc.
- **Employer**: details like Name, etc.

An Employee will have an association with Resume.  
An Employer will have an association with Opportunities.  

My problem is: both models will use the model User to authenticate.

So I thought:  
    User -&gt; has_one :employee
    User -&gt; has_one :employer

    Employee -&gt; belongs_to :user
    Employer -&gt; belongs_to :user

I will also have an mixed form that contains information from both models. Example:  

Form for Employee:  
* Email  
* Password  
* Name  
* FamilyName  
* Gender  
* Birthdate  

Form for Employer:  
* Email  
* Password  
* Name  
* Website  
* Description  


I'm using ""accepts_nested_attributes_for"" on the User model to accomplish that:  
    *accepts_nested_attributes_for :employee* 
    *accepts_nested_attributes_for :employer*  

So far so good. It works well

* manage the system as an admin

* perform complex queries on the consumer table(s)

So we have three broad roles, etc:

* Admins
* Clients
* Consumers

Admins and Clients share a lot of database column info like Name, etc. Consumers need this info plus dozens of other columns like birthday, gender, race, zip code, education level, etc. This will increase as time goes on as well.

I keep ending up in a brain loop on how to best implement this system. Should I make a base User class that HABTM roles and also has associated profiles like ""client_profile"" and ""consumer_profile""? This makes system administration simple (logins, etc) but will mandate using joins for most queries. There will be MANY complex queries for Consumers.

Or should I make single classes for Users, sessions, etc.

I'm completely new to ruby and the rails enviornment (and programming in general) but I was wondering if anyone could share some resources on how to actually use gems? I've been building my first website on my spare time (using bluehost) and I was trying to use memegen (gem) or meme_generator . (I'm pretty sure I've installed these correctly in my ruby/gems/gems path) The following is provided by BlueHost on using gems:

Using Your Ruby Gem(s)

You will need to add /home5/memesene/ruby/gems to the include path. 
You can do this by adding the following code to your script:
$:.push(""/home5/memesene/ruby/gems"")

However
To generate an image:

$ memegen a_dog ""Eat Crayons"" ""Poop Rainbows""
/tmp/meme-1234567890.jpg
$ 
You only have to supply one piece of text:

$ memegen a_dog """" ""AWESOME""

Each account (business) can have multiple users that are able to sign in. Each user of that business has multiple clients.  Each of those clients has documents.

I can use 'has many through' on the user model to obtain a list of all documents beneath that tree.

However

I can put something together to do it

For example

    class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
        def docs
            # let's say users have a has-many-through clients to docs.
