I've worked at this place for the past year and have always had my suspicions but they were confirmed when the ""principal"" typed up our ""accreditation"" on Microsoft word and I found out we are not accredited at all.

I remember seeing an AMA about a guy who used to work at ITT Tech
All they have do to is pay $425 and take a test and that's it. 

The ""Principal"" is a lying

That is NOT true. Pretty much only community colleges accept it. Major Universities don't accept it

I have seen countless people come in, only to come back in tears screaming because it wont get accepted anywhere.

There is a Texas Home School law that says that home schooled students are protected and this is the law that they use to operate. this is not a school. It is a business. A business that makes its money from preying on the uneducated and the elderly who are trying to get a diploma to get a higher paying job to support their families.

The"" curriculum"" is a complete JOKE. Everything is full of typos and it is all 8th grade level.

You should do neither.  Unless you were the one who called the cops

1. If the cops demand you identify yourself you should do so.  

2. If you are asked any other question, if the cops either ignore your question or say 'no, you are free to go, I just want to talk to you' then say ""alright I'm leaving then"" and walk away.  

3. If you are under arrest you should tell them that you are are requesting a lawyer and will not answer any questions except on the advice of a lawyer.  

Do not say *anything else*.  

For example if a police officer asks ""do you know this person"", if not, say you require assistance of counsel to proceed.  If a police officer asks ""are these your drugs or your friends drugs"" the answer is neither ""mine"" nor ""my friends"" it is ""I want to speak to a lawyer and exercise my right to remain silent.""

It is your right (in the United States) to remain silent and adverse inferences against you cannot be drawn by your silence.  

The police are not looking to exonerate you, they'd just arrest you.  

If they have already arrested you

If they make some kind of false promise that they'll go easy on you and make things go away if you tell them everything or name names, which they are allowed to do.  If they tell you that once it goes to the scary prosecutor its out of their hands and they can't ""help you"" anymore they are lying - any legitimate deal is negotiated by your lawyer and the prosecutor it isn't offered to you by the cops.  It is the judge and the prosecutor who controls your case once you are arrested - the police don't and are in no position to offer any deal or protection or whatever.  

Moreover

Don't give the cops evidence against an associate or potential co-defendant even if you want them to be convicted for un-selfish reasons.  The first and most obvious reason is that doing so often provides more evidence against yourself.  If blaming someone else is part of a strategy to either provide evidence against your guilt or to negotiate for a plea bargain, then you will have nothing additional to give up in negotiations apart from your own guilty plea.

1370710352.0,1fxlij,"Guidelines for reading, posting and responding to questions in /r/legaladvice",thepatman,105,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1fxlij/guidelines_for_reading_posting_and_responding_to/

/r/legaladvice has seen a large increase in readership in the last few months.  This is great, and we'd like to address them.

Below are a series of guidelines for reading

If you have questions

____________________________________________

GUIDELINES FOR READING /r/legaladvice:

1.  /r/legaladvice is here for simple questions and basic understanding about the law.  Your best bet is always to get a local attorney and give him or her the full set of facts in your case.  

2.  /r/legaladvice is primarily read by legal professionals from the USA.  As such

3.  /r/legaladvice will tell you what the proper legal answer is.  You may not like that answer.  You may disagree with that answer.  Heck

4.  /r/legaladvice is not your lawyer, or do hundreds of hours of legal research for free.  We're here to help clear up some of the mystery and confusion surrounding the law, and to help people better understand it.  

5.  /r/legaladvice is intended to help everyone.  Do not delete your posts or comments after you write them.  If you're concerned about being found out

6.  Always remember, and we owe you nothing.  We are happy to help, but if you become demanding or insulting, we have no problems ignoring or banning you.   

7.  Sometimes, so you don't encounter the legal system in the first place.  We're not making judgment calls - we're telling you how it is.  

8.  We cannot tell you what **will** happen in your case.  At best, and average case scenarios.  No one can predict the future.  

GUIDELINES FOR ASKING QUESTIONS IN /r/legaladvice:

1.  Search the subreddit before posting your question.  Many questions get asked over and over and over again

2.  **Always include your location.**  Country, and consider posting your county or city.  If the activity occurred in multiple locations(i.e. you live in Colorado but were arrested in Arizona) post all the relevant locations.  If you do not feel comfortable posting your location, then this is not the appropriate forum for you.  If you post without posting your location, we reserve the right to answer your question as if you live in Saudi Arabia.   

3.  If asking about a criminal charge

4.  Be succinct.  A paragraph, don't post that wall in the first place.  

5.  Write properly.  We're not going to pick apart your grammar here, whitespace and punctuation marks.  ""I'm posting from my phone!"" is a poor excuse for being unreadable.  

6.  If asked a question

GUIDELINES FOR RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS IN /r/legaladvice:

1.  Do not represent yourself as having more knowledge than you do

2.  Avoid being absolute in your answers.  Rarely is the law black and white

3.  Do not get defensive if other posters disagree with your answer.  Often

4.  If you disagree with another's answer


COMMON QUESTIONS AND COMMON ANSWERS(USA):

1.  ""Don't the police need a warrant to search my x?"": Not necessarily.  Police need probable cause

2.  ""Isn't this entrapment?"": No

3.  ""I'm being sued!  What do I do?"": Get a lawyer and respond to the suit.  Failure to respond will lead to a 'default judgment' - in other words

4.  ""I want to take my child away from my babydaddy/babymomma and not give them visitation ever!"": That is unlikely to happen.  Cutting a child's parent out of their life completely is very very rare.  

5.  ""The policeman was rude to me

6.  ""The policemen made a mistake on my ticket, they can simply re-issue the ticket with the proper information.

7.  ""My friend told me this sure-fire way to get out of trouble

8.  ""I was arrested and the police didn't read me my Miranda rights!  I can get the arrest thrown out, and the warnings are not required.

1365382753.0,1bvy50,"[Meta] Welcome, rules reminder, and FAQ",parsnippity,106,25, we have over 1, and I know contributors here are happy to help anyone we can. Welcome

I want to take this opportunity to direct your attention to the sidebar, it's reddit. While some of us are attorneys, we are in no way a substitution for someone you meet with in person, in your jurisdiction. 

I've had over 100 PMs in the last few hours asking a series of questions that are similar. I'm going to answer a few of them here in the hopes of clearing it up for as many people as possible at once. I'll also include some general information about what to expect here.

**What's with the stars?**

Stars are given to people who have given consistently strong answers to questions over a period of time. A star doesn't necessarily mean someone is an attorney... just that they generally know what they're talking about and that they've proven it. I'll also note that there are specialties within the legal world. As an example, but we're all on at different times, so your patience is appreciated.

**I'm from X country

Nearly everyone who contributes here is in the US. We have a couple people from Canada

**What we will and won't answer**

We'll explain laws to you and point you in the right direction in most situations. We won't help you break the law

We can't tell you whether or not you should plead guilty

**Be careful!**

Remember

**That girl was pregnant by her BROTHER?**

Yeah. Wait until you get to the one where the 20 year old claims he licked the vagina of an 8 year old because saliva has anti itch properties.

**General heads up**

We here at /r/legaladvice strive to remain as nonjudgmental as we can, it gets too absurd to help being judgmental. Outright rudeness to people asking honest questions isn't ok. Racism, sexism and homophobia aren't tolerated here. Lastly, while a certain amount of commentary is ok, our purpose is to offer legal assistance, and if you have none to offer, please refrain. :)

1368889721.0,1ekukp,My girlfriend died and her parents are keeping my son in a different country from me indefinitely. I just need some guidance.,CoCork5,96,15,16,"I know that young accounts aren't tolerated here

Last spring semester I met my girlfriend, and intelligent as Megan. We were sexually active, and admittedly not as careful as we could have been. She found out that she was pregnant a few days after she returned home in June, and could only tell me over skype. I never got to hold her and tell her that everything was going to be okay. I was able to tell her that I would support whatever she wanted.

Money is and was very tight for me. I'm back in school and working part time, I'd pay for her to get an abortion if she could find somebody to take care of her before and afterwards. It would have been 
impossible for me to go over to America to be with her during this time.

She told me that she wanted to keep our baby and I was pretty overjoyed... despite all of the speed bumps. I looked into transferring to an American college, prominent, yet Catholic family, and were pleased that their daughter chose to keep our child. It seemed perfect; It sucked I had to wait so long to be with them, but I knew that it would be worth it to finish my degree and be able to provide for my young family.

For the next few months I skyped my girlfriend everyday, things never go as planned, and Megan went into premature labor this past January (the baby was due in Feb). It's hard to type this. She died giving birth to our son. I wasn't contacted by her parents, and know everything from her best friend, Luke.

Her parents blame me for the death of their daughter and have taken custody of my son. Luke said that they gave him their last name. They refuse to let me see my son

Some of you might be thinking that I have dodged a bullet with this crazy family. But I don't give a shit about them. My son is my blood, custody is my main desire, but these people have so much money.

I've talked to one lawyer, unless they agree to a DNA test (they won't). Is this true?

My only ally is Luke

**Backstory:**
My mother (51, she cut off contact with my sister (19) and I (26) via email. We were the only people she had contact with at that time. 

We requested, they stated that, due to the fact their were no flies on the windows or any other signs of suicide, that the house was probably empty. 

I explained to them that she was most assuredly in the home in her bedroom with her bible and not much else. I explained to them my mother would starve to death if we didn't get her some sort of help. I was very clear to not temper expectations due to the severity of the situation. I also provided them documentation showing her mortgage had been in arrears almost $40

I asked them, the locksmith gained access to my mothers house through the garage door (where the contents of her home are boxed up). The cops enter through her packed garage a home without electricity, food or hot water and find her in her bedroom, sleeping on her couch next to her bible. They come out and tell me that they've found her upstairs alive. I run upstairs and I see my mother emaciated and half conscious from malnutrition. She demands I get the fuck out. 

The police escort my sister and I downstairs and say ""There is obviously something wrong here but she doesn't want you in the house."" so we are escorted out of the home. They say to us that we should leave and they are going to make arrangements with her so we can check on her well-being while maintaining her wishes to not see us. According to the police report

I contacted the police to see what arrangements were made to check on her well-being and I am connected with an officer who was on the scene the first time. He tells me that her determination was to not speak with us and that as far as he was concerned the case was closed. I reiterate once again that she is going to starve to death in this house if we don't get her out of there and he confirms nothing further can be done. 

She was found dead in her home on the 23rd of July with a listed natural cause as ""failure to thrive"".

On the night of Friday, I was approached by three police officers of the 62nd precinct of the NYPD. They asked if I had any drugs on me. I refused to consent to a search. One of the officers quickly replied with, ""oh well, we're here to frisk you for weapons"". Despite being aware of my rights when it comes to a stop-and-frisk, I again stated that I refused to consent to a search. Rather than explain my situation in a courteous, professional, and respectful manner, with my hands still in the air, ""STOP RESISTING

One of the officers began to act like I had hurt him. When ""backup"" arrived and they asked if he needed paramedics he said that he just needs an ice pack. I never even laid a finger on any of them. As I was loaded into an unmarked police vehicle (which they tend to use for drug searches around my neighborhood, I began say ""wow what a load of bullshit I can't believe this is actually happening,"" when the officer turned back around to me and started putting on a whole scene saying things like ""YOU PIECE OF SHIT YOURE GONNA ROT IN JAIL FOR TRYING TO A HIT AN OFFICER WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG YOU"" with a face redder than Rudolph's nose. The acting was impeccable, I could swear this man had Hollywood experience.

When I was taken to the precinct, while trying to conceal the above mentioned statement. I duly refused. Later, when my mother came into the precinct, they tried to make her a sign a blank form containing only my name and address (which she also duly refused to sign).

So

* Marijuana Possession (citation in NYC)
* Obstruction of Justice (misdemeanor
* Resisting Arrest (misdemeanor)
* Attempted Assault of a Police Officer (felony

I was relieved at my hearing where I was charged with a disorderly conduct (~~misdemeanor~~violation*) which will be expunged from my record after 6 months of no incidents. My understanding of this verdict is the following:

* Having refused to be searched
* Resisting Arrest wasn't brought up since it was never explicitly stated that I was under arrest (and there were eyewitnesses at the scene who could testify to this)
* Obstruction of Justice (I can't really rationalize this charge nor why it was dropped
* Attempted Assault of a Police Officer (the officers probably didn't go through with this since I refused the sign the police report and there were three eyewitnesses who would testify against it and the last thing these officers want to do is blatantly perjure themselves.

Having consulted with an attorney, shortly after the whole situation began, my glasses had fallen off my face and I couldn't see neither the police officers' names nor badge numbers. As I was carried away I had asked that one of the officer retrieved my glasses for me. They were never retrieved, and upon my release I came back to the place I was arrested and found the frames broken in two places and one of the lenses missing. I would really like to do something about this, however the only identifying information I have left is the first and last name of my arresting officer which was written on my property voucher which I memorized. I had (stupidly) given this voucher to retrieve my cell phone and keys before writing down the badge number of my arresting officer.

I wish to go the CCRB regarding my poor treatment by the officers

 * Can I walk into the precinct and ask for the badge number of my arresting officer by name? Also
 * Can I do any of this without fear of retribution of some sort? This particular precinct is
 * If I go to the CCRB and explain my situation (and mention the marijuana which I was not charged for) is there a chance that it would be added to my record
 * Is there any other way I could be compensated for my injuries and emotional trauma? I really don't have the money to gamble on a lawsuit.

He has tried in the past to get an ID however hit quite a few impasses including being told he had to name the doctors at his birth (there were none). His grandmother and a midwife were the witnesses however both are long since dead. 

We are also currently living in Washington and he hasn't been back to Kentucky for at least 5 years. Kentucky Common Wealth law used to have a stipulation where you could bring in two credible witnesses who would attest to the fact that you are who you say you are and then you could get a delayed birth certificate. But of the two people that have known him for a long enough period of time one also doesn't exist and the other is a multiple felon. So that kind of bars both of them from being ""credible"" people.

I want to take this opportunity to direct your attention to the sidebar, it's reddit. While some of us are attorneys, we are in no way a substitution for someone you meet with in person, in your jurisdiction. 

I've had numerous PMs in the last few hours asking a series of questions that are similar. I'm going to answer a few of them here in the hopes of clearing it up for as many people as possible at once. I'll also include some general information about what to expect here.

**What's with the stars?**

Stars are given to people who have given consistently strong answers to questions over a period of time. A star doesn't necessarily mean someone is an attorney... just that they generally know what they're talking about and that they've proven it. I'll also note that there are specialties within the legal world. As an example, but we're all on at different times, so your patience is appreciated.

**I'm from X country

Nearly everyone who contributes here is in the US. We have a couple people from Canada

**What we will and won't answer**

We'll explain laws to you and point you in the right direction in most situations. We won't help you break the law

We can't tell you whether or not you should plead guilty

**Be careful!**

Remember

**That girl was pregnant by her BROTHER?**

Yeah. Wait until you get to the one where the 20 year old claims he licked the vagina of an 8 year old because saliva has anti itch properties.

**General heads up**

We here at /r/legaladvice strive to remain as nonjudgmental as we can, it gets too absurd to help being judgmental. Outright rudeness to people asking honest questions isn't ok. Racism, sexism and homophobia aren't tolerated here. Lastly, while a certain amount of commentary is ok, our purpose is to offer legal assistance, and if you have none to offer, please refrain. :)

When I moved in, began making trouble for us. My house had been sitting empty for a while, and he'd been parking his car in front of it so that he could see it from his apartment window (I'm guessing that's why, anyway--it wasn't closer to his door than the apartment complex lot would be). The day I moved in, he came out to his car in ""his"" parking spot and screamed profanity at us (I guess because he was angry that someone was living there?) which made me and my other roommates very uncomfortable. That night, he spent his time peering into our windows and taking photographs of us from his apartment window. He also spent about 6 hours just standing at his window, staring into our house. 

The next day, and he was forced to move his car since it was on private property. He specifically told us that ""he would call the cops on us every night until we are evicted or arrested."" True to his word, the police have come to my house twice in the past two nights, for 1) someone quietly talking on the phone outside and 2) I had to jump my car last night and the ""engine was too loud"". 

Now, but I didn't sleep last night and I'm really getting scared. I bought a security camera last night, but I'm really sick of all of this.

Her justification - that she texted me a day later with no response from me and didn't even bother communicating with me even after two weeks after the incident. So her phone suddenly starts working once the insurance calls her. After a conference between the insurance, she calls me up and asks if I can be nice and reduce the amount and get the money in two different payments. I said Hell No!

&gt;Attend to this matter now or I will respond in the strongest possible terms.

Seriously man I wish you no disrespect and I'm genuinely sorry that I wasted your time but the fact that you couldn't tell that I was being sarcastic really worries me. There was a very big story recently about a photo of the singer Beyonce during a performance at the Superbowl that looked a little unflattering. Beyonce's people issued instructions to sites hosting the image to take it down immediately. This had the reverse effect and the photo went viral. If you put a photo online and do not put a ridiculous comment like ""Don't download this"" then nothing will happen. But by sticking this antiquated message on there it's like red rag to a bull. The Internet is full of idiots. Your photograph is beautiful, ""Warning, don't read this"".

I thought the matter would be closed once I pointed out that I had been joking but he didn't let it go. He sent me the following:

&gt;Copyright law stands online as in any other situation. I have significant evidence to suggest that you have overstepped the mark
&gt;
&gt;please feel free to research this. 
&gt;
&gt;i will prosecute you if you do not follow my previous request. 
&gt;
&gt;this is my business

&gt;you are a very stupid person if you even think that copyright law is something in the same ball park as 'do not read this' 
&gt;
&gt;please be warned that I will seek the fair commercial rate for your breach of copyright. 
&gt;
&gt;Let me tell you that under all western world copyright law that the copyright for any photo belongs to the person who took the picture.
&gt;
&gt;Comments on my pictures like you have made opens the way for other people to do the same. 
&gt;
&gt;this only ruins it for the people in the pictures who pay me to take them. It belittles their exclusivity

Maybe I should have prefaced this with the fact that I am not a drug dealer and besides the little bit of pot there were in fact no drugs in my house. 

They kept looking in my freezer and like three different cops asked me why I had frozen rats in there to which I pointed out the giant fucking aquarium directly behind them with the giant fucking snake in it. They took pictures of the inside of my freezer including my snake food and some frozen meat.

While they were searching I asked if the handcuffs were necessary.  I was crying and I was really uncomfortable. They said yes and that I was under arrest at which point I wanted to remind them that they hadnt read me my rights or shown me a warrant but I was scared shitless and was afraid of antagonizing them.

Im not really sure how long they were here but it didnt feel like they looked very hard. Mostly they dug through our desk drawers and kept looking in the fridge and freezer. Apparently they were looking for shrooms i finally found out when I saw the warrant.

Finally they finished. Of course they didnt find anything except the pot that I was completely honest with them about.  Then they gave me the warrant and the report and told me to expect something in the mail and left. On their way out I heard the one that had been questioning me say ""probably nothing is going to happen"" but I wasnt sure if he was talking to me or one of the other officers. The same one told my boyfriend that they were going to come back with another warrant but I think he might have just been trying to scare him because he had called the cop a liar when they tried to tell him I was a drug dealer. 

Some of them left in a green van and we put two and two together. The trailer next to ours had been empty for months but that green van was almost always parked there. Apparently they had been watching our street for months. We had seen cops on our street before at other peoples houses but we live in a trailer park so we never thought anything of it.

I just cannot fathom how they could have thought I was dealing drugs. I work a full time job and a part time job. I come and go from my house to go to work and sometimes run some errands. In the little bit of free time I have I sit at home watching tv with my bf. We never have people over. Most of our friends are married and have kids and we dont see them much.  

So anyways now my front door is busted and the only clue I have as to what isngoing to happen next is ""expect something in the mail"" and maybe they will come kick down my door again with another warrant. I am just so fucking freaked out. I have no idea how they could have thought I was a drug dealer and its driving me crazy. Im so scared that I cant sleep or eat. I dont even feel safe in my own home right now.

I have already told my dad and told him that I might need a lawyer.

I guess my question is what should I expect?

 And do I have any legal means of finding out how the fuck they could have possibly thought I was a drug dealer?

And what could happen if they decide to do anything about the pot considering its my first offense and have an otherwise clear record ?

UPDATE
Looking at my warrant it says on the warrant that there should be a signed affidavit attatched which there is not. Maybe that is what they intend on sending us in the mail?

I don't really care about the personal items/money she took...that can be recovered in time and I didn't want her on the street anyway.  But she cleaned out my business account for about 7500.00.

 I've waited about a month to try and reason with her before calling the police but now I feel like I don't have an option.  She hasn't responded to anything and now my customers are pissed because I haven't delivered. 

what are my options if any?  I don't have money to hire a lawyer which is what brought me here. 

TLDR -ex GF stole 7500 from business account which was money customers gave me to purchase parts for them...it's not disposable income.

edit: I have printscreen of my bank account that shows the -7500.00 withdrawal and my bank confirmed it was done by her.  I also have another printscreen that shows where she deposited cash later to take the account from negative to 0 balance and then she closed the account.  Apparently she didn't want her credit ruined for having a negative bank account.

I'm not worried about the drug test showing illegal drugs but the day before I took 1/2 Vicodin.

In order to become a DRE a student needs [75% lab conformation rate](http://www.ci.la.ca.us/lapd/traffic/dre/drgdrvr.htm).  See footnote 43.

Every call I made or email I sent would only be responded to by the younger associate. The first hearing was attended by both, and meek in the courtroom. The judge even chastised him at one point for not knowing what he was talking about. But he was the only one who would return my calls.

In March I got a call from the original, in which my (soon to be) ex husband's lawyer and he LAUGHED about the incompetence of the former attorney. 

I was told there was a great chance that my ex would have to pay my attorney's fees. I had been a stay at home mom. I had been counting on that (perhaps too much). My last payment was a month and a half ago. I have paid $4,800 more currently.

But I'm guessing that they can't cut my pay for hours already worked - I can't find a source for that.

This is what I assume:
1) I have to pay some amount back to them
2) the amount I have to pay back is the # of hours I worked during the mistaken period times 9.50. Basically
3) They have to present me with a schedule for repayment that is reasonable.

(Virginia)",OliveShmolive,40,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ftr9p/i_have_been_emotionally_abused_at_work_for_over_a/, bitch

  There have been several verbal altercations that were immediately reported to my boss (the owner of the clinic) by me. Whether by text message or by phone. My boss always says she'll talk to Beth but nothing ever happens long term. She does talk to Beth but it doesn't do any good and actually seems to make things worse. 

  Today was a normal day, it's that employees responsibility. It's not my responsibility period to care for the clinic cats or any boarding animals, only hospitalized patients. Another employee spoke to Beth about why the kittens weren't cared for and Beth replied to that employee ""Well where the hell is Oliveshmolive?"" Implying it was my job to take care of them. Despite this, I got to it anyway because not doing it out of principle would mean the kittens went hungry and thirsty and sitting in their own filth. I did however text my employer to let her know that Beth was not doing her job. 

  A short time later, telling me it's not her fucking job to take care of the kittens, I took care of them and I'm a fucking bitch for telling the boss she wasn't doing her job, calling me a know it all cunt and sloppy cow and a fat bitch etc... I replied ""You're not doing your fucking job"" and she yells at me ""I'm the fucking groomer it's not my job to take care of the animals."" I told her that if she brought them in their her responsibility. I don't know what she said here but after quite some times of abuse I eventually said ""Why are you such a bitch?"" and her face is so close to mine she's spitting in my mouth as she yells at me. Then she bucks at me and I back up against the counter and she pushes me by my shoulders. I immediately took out my phone and dialed 911, I told the operator all that had happened. While I'm on the phone she's saying she wished I would hit her so she could beat my ugly face in. All of the other employees claimed to not have seen her push me, they're her friends after all so why would they admit to seeing it. 

  When the police arrived

  My employer later contacted me by phone. It was a 30 minute conversation and I don't remember what she said verbatim but the gist of the conversation was that if I wasn't to come back to work until the protective order was gone, and that I would be fired if I refused to drop the protective order. I told her that if she were to fire me, I would be taking legal action against the clinic as whole. 

  I have an interview at another vet clinic tomorrow afternoon and if I'm offered the position, which has always been fine but my depression has severely worsened since working there. I intended to leave the clinic I'm at anyway but I didn't want it to happen like this, I was going to quietly give my two weeks when I found a suitable position and be done with it but that's become impossible in light of recent events. 

  My questions are: Do I have grounds to take legal action upon my termination? Do I have grounds to take legal action if I quit

Here's the deal, and they came and solved the issue. I wasn't charged a dime. I never looked into my housing contract, so I assumed the maintenance was my apartment office's responsibility since they owned the complex.

Well, my pregnant girlfriend came home and did not know it had happened. She slipped on the water, fell, and landed directly on her stomach. I was at work, she called me and I told her to get in touch with her OBGyn and they told her to go to the emergency room. She and the baby are okay, thank Odin.

I felt that, that the corporation that owns our apartment complex should at least pay for the copay of her visit. I called the office after the incident and explained the situation. I wasn't mad, I wasn't disrespectful, and I felt I handled it with tact. They told me there was nothing they could do until the manager comes in today.

1365832335.0,1c9981,Police kicked in my door thinking that I am a drug dealer. (UPDATE),Ziaki,37,6,8,"[Original Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17kfzm/police_kicked_in_my_door_thinking_that_i_am_a/)

Somebody requested an update on this and what has happened since. Short version: nothing really.

Long Version:
We called the police department several times trying to get a hold of the dick bag that kicked our door down. They kept telling us that they would have him call us back. He never did so we kept calling. 

We finally got a hold of him and asked if we could have the affidavit or at least some explanation as to why they thought I was a drug dealer. He said ""I don't have anything to say to you. You'll find out when we take you to court. Maybe you should get a lawyer."" and hung up on my boyfriend.

My boyfriend had already contacted his lawyer but he was pretty slow to get back with us. When he finally did he told us that he had found that the police department has no legal obligation to give us an affidavit or even an explanation. (At least here in Michigan anyways.) He advised us to let it go as further harassing  the police department wouldn't get us anywhere and maybe even make the situation worse. So we've pretty much given up.

We have since had to put our door together with bolts and put in a new door knob since we can't afford a new door. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/Fh0k3go.jpg)

We now lock the deadbolt and the doorknob even while we are in the house. We know it won't keep them out if they decide to come back and terrorize us some more but it still makes us feel a little better. (It boggles my mind some times to think about how I've never worried about being robbed but now we lock our doors because we are terrified of the people that are suppose to protect us.)

We now check the mail everyday. The last time I had to appear in court (for a fender bender ticket) I didn't receive my summons until AFTER the court date and they lied about when it was sent out. So not only did i have to pay the ticket but I had to pay a fine for not showing up to court. So now I'm paranoid as fuck they they are going to pull the same shit. 

My sister's husband who is also an attorney said that that if there is an ongoing investigation that could explain why they refuse to give me any information. I find this fairly likely since they raided the house across the street from us just a week or two ago. (I swear they are just going door to door kicking people's doors down because we live in a nice neighborhood and they don't have anything better to do.) 

I am now on several medications to manage my anxiety. For about the first month after the incident I was taking 3- 5 xanax a day because people kept bringing it up and wanting to talk about it and every time I did I'd have a severe panic attack. I had to take a sleep aid every night (some times I still do) because I couldn't close my eyes without reliving it in my head. 

I feel absolutely and utterly violated and it will haunt me to the day I die that I as U.S. citizen have no right to know why the police felt the need to kick down my door, blatantly lie to my face, and to my boyfriend, and tear apart my house. 


If anybody has any further advice for me it is definitely welcome.
I live in Michigan. It was the Macomb County Police Department that raided my house. I have a warrant but no affidavit. If anybody has any idea as to how to get them to tell me why the fuck they thought I was a drug dealer I would love to hear it.

I feel awful even posting this, but I'm looking into it just to see my options.

So, but I did not have insurance, and so I went through another hospital who took me under charity care. The urologist they referred me to was a young guy, probably mid-thirties, but super nice and I really liked him. 

After seeing my ultrasounds, to check if it had spread. He also sent me for blood work to check for tumor markers (this came back negative). A lymph node in my pelvis was swollen, so he said that it spreading was a possibility, and that the next step was a orchiectomy (Radical Inguinal Orchiectomy), and then we will deal with the lymph node. Within like 5 days I was on the operating table and had them removed. 

After the procedure (and before I woke up) he came out and told my family that the first testicle he pulled out had no signs of cancer, they just had some sort of small necrosis. He seemed really embarrassed when he explained it all to me at the follow-up, though he never directly apologized. But he looked guilty, and I felt bad for him.

Basically, so it was very rushed. 

Now here's the complicated part: I'm transgender (male-to-female, and I had not made any plans to remove my testicles at this point. I was keeping my options open, though when I was confronted with having testicle cancer, I obviously had no problems with him removing them. It just turned out afterwards that I did not have cancer.

My entire family is telling me I should sue the doctor, having them taken out was beneficial for me anyway in my transition. And because one of my parents ended up pushing me into disclosing my transgender status to my doctor before-hand, I worry he may have taken out the last testicle for me as a favor, even! And how much of a scumbag would I be to turn around and sue him for that? But at the same time, I now am locked into never being able to have biological children, and before this I was keeping my options open. I was put into a position where I thought it was risking my life, or having biological children - so of course I chose life. I was also in the middle of a very close family member dying (and subsequently did die a few weeks later) of cancer

On top of never being able to have children, the ER, ER doctor, ER radiologist, anesthesiologist, etc are all charging me. I do not have anywhere close to the money they want from me. 

In the end, and I can't see any sort of mistake he made. He didn't biopsy my testicle at any point, but he did do blood work to check for tumor markers (this came up negative). So I don't know if he actually made any mistakes, and if my case holds any weight. 

Sorry, how bad is a malpractice suit for a doctor? What repercussions does that have for him? I just don't want to ruin his career...

Because the defective piping lies in the units, because this will ensure that the project is completed.

The corporation's chosen contractor (Company A) has quoted us $15K to do our unit.  Our neighbor's quotes range from $12K to $20K.  We felt these numbers to be ridiculously high

 I am a tipped employee. My company pays me 6.00 per hour. As i make my tips they go into a lock box that I can not open. At the end of my shift the employer opens the box and takes 10% to create a pool for a group of employees that can't receive tips.  I get no part of this pool.

 After they have taken the pool for the employees that do not receive tips they take another 35% of my tips. They claim that this goes to taxes and to help cover insurance and other deductions. This does not seem to make sense though because these deductions and taxes are being taken out on my check as well. So at the end of the night I take home 55% of what I was tipped for the night.

 The next issue I have is that they have us do other duties that do not pertain to our job. These duties are not tipped and we are still making 6.00 per hour while doing them.

 Keep in mind my employer has hundreds of people that are in my position following these same set of rules.

 The only thing I can find that seems to pertain to this situation is this

Alright

The building I live in has an empty office space up front, a large studio apartment. I do not, nor have I ever, had access to the front (business) part of the building.

The bills are

Last week I pay my rent electronically like any other month

So yesterday I wake up to someone pounding on my door. They ask why I am there, and gave me a number for a bank.

I call the bank who says they did foreclose on the property

I call my landlord whose number has been turned off. 

From what I can gather from the various phone calls:

* The previous owner (my landlord) went into default then foreclosure.

* The landlord claimed the property had no one living there.

* The person who knocked on my door is the current owner of the property and is unwilling to have tenants as he wishes to live in the apartment in back.

The current owner says that he is planning to move into the apartment

The current owner also states that my lease is basically toilet paper as it was with the previous owner

I have no way to get in contact with the previous owner

**The Questions**

Do I have any claim to stay on the property? At least until I can find another place?

Any suggestions on how to find the old owner (my landlord) so I can get my security deposit/rent back?

I didn't realize the bank could foreclose/sell a property so fast

Thanks to anyone who can help me.

I got home today to find my stuff out on the streets, etc. and they straight up moved my stuff back in (thank god). Talked to a lawyer too, and like the comments say, I have 90 days AT LEAST to get my shit together and move out. 

The officers helped me document all of my things

My lawyer says that as long as I continue to pay rent, or that it may take a long time to do so (It was only $500 and it may cost more to fight for it than to just drop it, so oh well). 

The officers called the current owner and had a talk with him, not mine, never was) but not in my apartment. 

Moved all my absolute valuables to my job (my boss is really understanding and is letting me have some time off with pay to work this out.) 

Thanks for all the help

So I have found and moved into a new apartment! I am also (hopefully) going to be receiving my security deposit from the new owner with compensation for my broken property.

I live in a house with 2 roommates, etc, her dog barks its brains out at all hours of the day and early in the morning.  This has been going on for years.

Initially, one of her friends (they are both in their 50's), came over obviously intoxicated.  I had a few people over and answered the door, her friend accused me of harrassing her and asserted that she'd been staying with our neighbor for 2 weeks and had never heard the dog bark, which of course isn't true.  There are about 6 people that witnessed this interaction.  It's become a serious battle.

Fast forward to last Friday, texts, etc.  He hasn't personally contacted her in at least 18 months, which can be proven by his phone records. She also alleges that she now feels unsafe in her home due to us, and she's suing for $25,000 in punitive damages.

Now there is no case in court, money and stress.  I've been researching anti-slapp motions, but this is beyond the scope of what I really understand legally.  

So lawyers of reddit, but I can't believe that due to complaining to the city and following their process, that we've become subject to a suit like this.

-----

A few years ago

That semester cost me $20, **I paid for this school entirely with federal student loans**: a couple subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, and one supermassive Parent PLUS loan, which was listed in my parents' names.

When I left this private college

Note the second sentence on the form: **""If the loan has already disbursed

I left the school and returned home and thought everything was good. I called to request a transcript six months later — they inform me that there is a hold on my account for $20, I was shocked to discover this. 

The reason they did this, I checked the ""cancel"" box for the fall semester that I had already completed**. It hadn't even crossed my mind that, even though the semester had ended, even though it had been months after the loans had been disbursed, *even though the form itself says a loan can be cancelled only within 30 days of the disbursement*, because I checked that one fucking box, I got screwed over.

I contacted the ombudsman group at the Department of Education

Now, I cannot get accepted to any other colleges or universities because, without the transcript from that school, they refuse to accept me (or give me financial aid). And the school refuses to give me the transcript because there's a $20,000 hold on my account.**

Do I have a case for anything? Or should I start considering bankruptcy? I will do anything to get done with college. But I can't do anything without that transcript.

**EDIT 2013/06/28 17:47** Body shop updated estimate to just under 6 grand. Bluebooks says my car is only worth 6 grand in the first place so now I'm considering just taking a check

**EDIT 2013/07/06 20:05** Received check from their insurance so I consider this claim mostly done. I've re-uploaded the footage on a throwaway account for your enjoyment.

I'll try to sum up the situation as concisely as possible

This all happened in the state of Delaware.

My father molested my older sister (his step daughter) beginning when she was about 3 and continuing until after I was born, who told her parents, who told my mother.  My mother separated from him, and apparently required him to turn himself in.  He did so, but was told they could do nothing unless my older sister pressed charges, which she didn't want to do.  She didn't want to break up the family, take my father away from me and my younger sister, my older siblings moved away as soon as they could

I found out about all this when I was 16, and I suppose I deceived myself into believing this was an isolated instance of regressive pedophilia, and that while it was absolutely horrible, it was not going to happen again.  My mother made it clear that we needed financial assistance from my father, and I continued in a strained relationship with him until after my grandparents (with whom he lived, and who had played a very large part in raising me) died.  Around the time they died, it came out that my younger sister had also been molested.  I cut off all contact with my father

At this time, upon hearing what had happened to my younger sister, sent the Delaware police a letter my father had written to her years before, essentially apologizing for what he had done to her.  The cops couldn't use it.  

So she flew to Delaware, and filled a USB drive with the first 1000 or so.  She took this to the cops, who said they could not use it, and that the things she had found did not meet the apparently rigorous standards for actionable child porn.  She told me the photos she saw were all of clothed, but eroticized children.

The lawyer I spoke with basically told me there was nothing I personally could do about this because he never abused me sexually.  One of my sisters would have to bring charges.  We also talked about the possibility of my older sister bringing a civil suit against him.  Since my younger sister does not seem to be remotely ready to bring legal action against him

I personally am left enraged and deeply concerned that he might do something to other children.  His parents

I feel desperate to do something about this, and I won't personally feel any closure until my father is dead or incarcerated.",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,

I moved out of my parents house on August of 2008 as soon as I turned 18. I left on not good terms with my mother, they moved out, so i had to put the PG&amp;E in my name for the first time in my life.

So when I called, so i asked them for the address where the bill was due. The Address that they gave me was from the house my parents moved into after I moved out. The dates from the $3,200 bill are Sept 2008 to June of 2009.   

So since i moved out in Aug 2008, so she was able to put the PG&amp;E in my name and not any of my other siblings.

June 2009, is that they broke up and both moved out.
 

My mom has always been a scam artist

So the PG&amp;E person that I was speaking too

I gave them my moms name

But then she said she kept running into walls

So I gave her the name of the guy she cheated on my dad with

Then they told me that they were going to send me a fraud packet

So my question is

Should I wait for the packet to come in and just follow the directions? Should I go to the police station and file some sort of report?

Also

Would a restraining order be a good idea?

1374750281.0,1j0r21,I was fired and the person from legal aid said my case sounds like discrimination...I have a few questions if anyone has a few minutes to help,BetOn00,31,6,17,"I worked at a casino(as a slot technician) that ran a promotion with a wheel like the one in the Price is Right(only smaller). There were approximately 20 numbers on it. The goal was to hit the highest # twice and the second highest once in 3 tries.  Something about the wheel seemed a little off.  When the highest # came around the wheel would speed up past it.  If the # almost crested the top the wheel would actually go backwards a # in the front.  If the wheel was correctly balanced this couldn't happen(there were pegs between each # and a fairly sturdy rubber pointer that hit the pegs). I inspected the wheel. They had plates on both sides

My job was to repair or report any abnormalities on the Casino floor.  I reported this wheel to my super, but it was for a valid reason(it was only $30 and we were allowed to issue a max of $100). I followed our training rules. We were advised in training that nobody would ever be reprimanded for writing them and they encouraged us to. I was a good employee who scored higher than most in my department. I had never been reprimanded for misconduct. I drover 35 miles each way for a worthless $10-13(raises over 3 years) wage. Anyways they suspended me and fired me a week later.  Then I get my unemployment and they appealed it and won somehow.  Now I have no job and owe unemployment $1200.  My house/car payment is coming due soon.  I was working on finishing my CCNA, but now I'm probably going to have to put that on the back burner so I don't lose my house.  I feel like I was targeted due to informing lottery about their weighted wheel. The casino I work for is very dirty with the way they treat workers. I was told by a higher up that front line people were ""expendable"". These people hide in their offices all day and couldn't last one day on the floor with angry customers.  I tried to get public defender to help me, but they denied me.  My wife makes $22 an hour, but they don't take into account there's only one person paying for food, mortgage, 2 cars, taxes
So, so hopefully they'll reverse the decision into my favor), my car/house payment is due and I have no job. I am an ethical person and it disgusted me knowing that people were coming there and playing their hard earned money to earn entries for spins on the wheel to win $500k, but little did they know the game is rigged.  I also found that they new system we installed has the ability to change the percentage on a machine depending on what person's card is in.  I said something to the manager and she pulled me aside and said not to tell the attendants because they'll tell the customers.  I don't want to say any names because I think I might go to a lawyer, but at least I think I'll go to the newspapers about the wheel. 

They sent screen shots for the unemployment hearing(was over the phone) and the guy running it said that all he saw was black squares(sent via fax).  They said they'd send him in color pictures.  I asked for a copy of their evidence.  I received a copy with nothing but black squares.  On the determination the times were wrong(I wasn't even at work during the time the judges paperwork says).  What they accused me of was ""gross misconduct"".  There's stuff listed for being intoxicated at work, larceny and assault listed.  Really?  They said I was ""inappropriately playing a video game at work"" and the free play was ""theft and is a deliberate disregard of the employer's interest"".  Everything that I did was by the books that night.  I believe that I pissed someone off real bad by catching their weighted wheel and they wanted rid of me.  

One more thing...when they pulled me in the office I did play dumb at first

Sorry for the length

EDIT:
I forgot to mention that the paperwork the casino submitted as proof was black squares where there was supposed to be pictures(the judge said it was impossible to see anything in his copy due to fax and they said they'd mail a copy).

1367384527.0,1dgqt0,I'm being falsely accused of sexual abuse. Please help.,needsadvice2013,27,4,31,"This is obviously a throwaway account.

My girlfriend is involved in a bad custody battle with her ex husband over their young daughter. In a dirty attempt to gain ground in the battle

My girlfriend's ex husband is a really bad person. At 18, drank and partied excessively and was verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive with her. He made her move out of her parents house and live with him and his family (7 people living in a small, 2 bedroom apartment), and not have any contact with her family. She was 'in love' and this made her abide by his rules.

He eventually joined the army for a brief time, so he went to an army psychologist and was deemed unfit for service and was generally discharged from the army. They still ended up getting divorced.

Fast forward some time, so we had a history. We fell in love,  and I was always there for her and her daughter, whom she has shared custody with her ex. I drive her to meet with him and exchange her daughter every week (and I mean EVERY week). I have a good job, so I can buy my girlfriend and her daughter things. I'll take them to Chuck E. Cheese. I'll buy her daughter cartoon Dvds, toys, and many things that a 3 year old would need.

When I'm in the house with my gf and her daughter

Getting back to the daughter, I leave the room. If my gf is changing her daughter,  I leave the room and stay as far from it as possible. She's not my kid, so I don't have any reason to be near her when she's being bathed or clothed.

I do play with her outside and inside with her mother in the same room. I read to her. I build things with her and her Legos. I play video games with her (Dora games). We hit golf balls outside. We chase the dog. We ride the golf cart; we do light hearted stuff that a child of 3-4 years old does. I feel like I go above and beyond for my gf and her daughter. I would never put myself in a compromising situation with her. I've only had to babysit her one time out of emergency because my gf has to work late and her mother (who always watches my gfs daughter) wasn't around. All we did for the 2 hours was watch TV. If she wanted something

Getting back to my girlfriend's ex husband, but still dating. His mother, whom he still lives with, is more manipulative than he is. I believe during the time they had the daughter, his mother was coaching the daughter to say things like I made her pull down her pants in front of me. These words would never come out of her mouth without someone making her. Mt gf's mother told her about how the ex's mother acted like her granddaughter was here's. She was apparently always taking her from my gf, and making her feel inadequate as a mother. This shows more of how my gf was controlled by this household.

There were a time we had the daughter and my gf was bathing her, ""But daddy loves me."" We should have known to report that but we are both young and would never dream something like this could be going on with her daughter. There was also another time we picked up her daughter and asked her who told her to say that I made her pull down her pants, and she said, ""Grandma made me say that, but you didn't make me pull down my pants, (my name). Grandma made me say it."" This was suspicious but we were too stupid to realize what was actually happening.

Fast forward to last week, crying like crazy... Being hysterical. He said he was going to give her back that Wednesday, so she sucked it up and made it to Wednesday. On Wednesday, an hour before we were supposed to leave, he calls saying he's keeping her until she gives him an answer about her and her daughter moving back to his area so the daughter can be in school full time starting September. My gf told him that she doesn't have to give him an answer and that we're going to court to her the daughter back.

The next day we get in court and get a hearing. The ex shows up 5 mins late with a 'confidential' envelope. He takes the envelope to the judge's office and we find out that he called child protective services saying that the daughter is ""at risk"" of sexual abuse by me! This is outrageous. I have nothing to do with their custody battle. I was just supportive of my gf in this. We were together for 2 years and I wanted to show her that I support her in getting full custody of her daughter.

So

So

Please let me know what I need to do to prove I'm innocent and those charges are false. Her ex knows these are false. I want to take the fight back to him. I would love to sue him for false accusations

I will answer any question I can as long as it doesn't reveal personal info. Please help!

TL;DR Read all of it, read all of it.

1367362887.0,1dfzk7,Texas: Aftermath of cleaning a hoarder's house,blackwolf555,30,6,55,"A few days ago my friends and I helped clean out a hoarder's home. Our old high school friend's parents were out of town for the weekend and he wanted to clean his house. He had warned us and we did our best to prepare ourselves with supplies.

The first thing that hit us was the smell. For 10 years the carpet was bombarded with cat urine and feces. There was even a blood stain from a cat in heat or a cat that had a litter. The carpet was absolutely ruined and the Rug Doctor we rented did nothing. There were piles of stuff everywhere and barely a clear space to even sit. What furniture there was

The kitchen was worse. The fridge was packed to the brim with expired food.  Not only was most of their 'food' expired but there is a major roach infestation. As we worked to uncover the floor

The severity of the situation prompted us to invite over my roommate's friend who works in animal control since our friend owned cats and there were 22 strays living in the backyard (His mother actively fed them). He took note of the house's condition and the health of the cats. Drawing from his experience he told us that the house

The things that were thrown out was trash. Papers from years gone by, and items that no longer worked (they had five vacuums). It took two days and a mini-dumpster but we managed to ease the clutter and make the kitchen usable again (they could only use a crockpot, the microwave, and mostly ate fast food).

Despite all this

My friend was trying to do the best thing for his family and called us for help. He especially thought that his father would support him. His father is asthmatic, instead my friend found that his father sided with his mother who is a raging alcoholic (The loss of a loved one had greatly impacted her, sparking the hoarding). We assume he did this to appease his wife but his son and our friend is absolutely crushed. After a stream of verbal abuse he was unceremoniously kicked out. 

We understand that the residence needs to be reported to the city through the proper channels but we're trying to allow our friend to recover emotionally before his house before doing so.That night till present he has been receiving abusive texts from his family.

His mother initially wanted $5, and practically inedible. Now his parents, want all who we're involved to collectively give them $10,000. They've even threatened us with trespassing!

Though we doubt they will actually pursue charges since that would mean inviting someone into their home

This is how I found out the sewer was clogged - I found some receipts from the previous owner to a plumbing company and they said that they had been out to this house multiple times in the past.  About every 6 months to a year they have to unclog roots that are growing through a crack in the pipe.  The plumber told me he recommended that the previous owner fix the pipe but he was selling the house and did not want to spend the money to fix it.  This happened after the 3rd time it flooded,000 to clean up.  

Now in my contract to purchase the house, although he did check the box saying it has flooded in the past.  There is no way I can afford to pay $15,000 to remove the mold, not to mention the 10 - 15 grand to replace the carpet, dry wall, insulation, ruined furniture, possibly have to be tested more than twice.  I have about $3,000 or something (this is not cheap for southern Illinois).  My lawyer's best legal advice was for me to quit paying my mortgage until the bank takes the house back over.  After the bank sells the house


Other notes: 


- My lawyer told me not to mention to the bank that I was going to stop making my mortgage payments.  It seems like if I tell them they might be able to help me out

- My insurance company does not cover mold damage

- I am paying someone to come by next week and test the air for mold and to take samples of the mold to see if it is dangerous to live here.  This isn't a problem I can just put off.

Heres a little recap:

I was traveling South on a highway crossing over another highway and had a green light. The lady who hit us ran the red light going east. After the impact my truck was facing North East.. she was going between 50 and 60 and did not hit the brake or swerve at all. There were 3 or 4 witnesses that attested to the same story.. My green light and her completely running her red.

My father was in my passenger seat which was virtually hit head on by the woman.

We were both wearing our seat belts and neither of us were seriously injured

I am asking because it is our intent to sue the lady who I think got a DUI. Someone on the scene saw her doing the walk the line test and then shortly after did not see her around. I'm not sure if she has insurance but she drove a GMC Envoy Denali so I have my fingers crossed.

We own a condo in metro Detroit, since we purchased our home in 2009. 

This recent leak has caused the ceiling over our shower to crumble in (for the second time) and our association sent maintenance here to remove the wet drywall so that it can dry

The upstairs condo was recently purchased (within the last month) and the gentleman seems to be a huge asshole. We've had little-to-no direct contact with him, but when our maintenance man told him today that he believes the pipes were messed with by the new owner and that he would be responsible for all costs that accrue from replacing our drywall, new owner went ballistic and hung up on him. New owner then proceeded to drive to our property management company's office and threaten lawsuit if they try to go after him for anything. So, basically, dude sounds like a bit of a loose cannon.

**TL;DR - the question:** While it's a huge inconvenience to us to have our bathroom all jacked up, or whatever idiot plumber he called, decided that there was no need to screw this panel back on when they finished the work, even though you can see *DIRECTLY INTO MY TUB*. Considering his level of vengeance against the property company for simply informing him that if it's his fault, he needs to pay, I'm seriously thinking he might've left it open to just be a dickhead.

I called the property management and they were pretty upset about it. They told me they would contact the owner ASAP and tell him to get his ass over there to seal up the hole. It's been three hours, which would take all of 60 seconds for someone to screw on, remains open for an extended period of time (say, 24/48 hours), is there anything we can do legally?

On May 13th

On April 12th my wife took our 2008 Toyota Corolla in for an oil change. The mechanic told her she needed badly needed a new serpentine belt and urged her to get it replaced as soon as possible. A couple weeks later, they also gave her a ten dollar discount on the work they performed. They said if it made any noise to bring it back and they'd fix it.

Two weeks later it started squealing. Lightly at first

An hour before they closed I called them for a status. They said they still couldn't get the bolt out of the engine block. They hoped to have it fixed by closing. Closing comes and goes

The next morning I contact them, on Wednesday, May 15th, I decide it is time to call the corporate office. I look up the number on their website and call. After two rings it goes to voice mail. No auto-attendant, no IVR, no options, nothing. I begin leaving a detailed voicemail message when, it cuts me off and goes to a busy signal. At that point I decide I need to get my car back, they both seemed very relieved.

I had the car towed to Dobbs, saying it was too damaged and needed deep engine work to get fixed.

The mechanics at Grease Lightning not only damaged my tensioner and broke off the bolt in the engine block, making it impossible to put a new bolt back in. ""Mangled"" is the word they used.

I decide to have the car towed to the nearest Toyota dealer. That was late Saturday. I called the Toyota service center and they said they were about to close but, I discover that the mechanics at Grease Lightning broke my car so bad--the service manager used the word ""mangled"" just like the guy at Dobbs--that they can't repair it, and it needs an entire new engine block. They quoted me a price of $6,000.

That was yesterday. I spoke to the district manager of Grease Lightning and he said he would submit everything to the company insurance to pay for the repair. I said if I didn't hear anything by 9 am the next day (May 21st--today) that I would call him. He said that would be perfect.

I've called him twice. He lets my call go to voicemail.

The next day (July 14) I checked my transaction report online to see that I was around $100.00 short of what I thought I had. At first I thought I just overspent on the steam sale


The first was by IHOP directly for $45.26 (the price of the entire bill).
The second was by a seperate company name (withheld incase it's against some sort of rules) for $35.26 (difference between the $10.00 I wanted to pay and the $45.26 they charged me for)


So I assumed what happened was they mischarged me ($35.26 too much)


resulting in a total charge of $80.52 for a charge I approved of $10.00...
So the first time I called I was trying to be nice


So I waited 15 minutes
when I googled the company name


So I called back the next day and got the manager who said they would reimburse me both charges ($70.52) and not to worry. I checked today and see a reimbursement for only $35.00... This really got me upset because not only is it not the two charges ($70.52)


I have no idea what to do. I don't want to call them screaming and look like an idiot


Thanks...


Not that it matters much but the tip was over 30%.

I do not drink. Ever. Not even a sip. I am, because I am overly cautious on the road. I was recently pulled over on a highway while driving friends home from the bars at 2am. The officer told me that I was driving well below the speed limit, and changed lanes several times (drunk buddies kept changing their minds about where to exit for fast food).


Now, asked me if I had been drinking, and when I said that I do not drink, he told me not too drive so slow in the future and sent me on my way without a ticket or written warning. 


My question is this: if the officer had (understandably) asked me to do a field sobriety test or blow into a breathalyzer, I've heard that field tests can be subjective, and breathalyzers can give false positives. Assuming that they arrested me (either for a false positive, or refusing the field test/breathalyzer), a subsequent blood test would show a .00.  Would that result clear everything up? Is it better to just do the field test when you're pulled over? I'm just curious about the best course of action.

1369861112.0,1fajvm,Man misrepresented himself as working for an auto body shop. Has my car and insurance money. Will not return either. [Massachusetts],legaladviceta,20,1,15,"Using a throwaway as I don't want this linked to my real account.  I am also truncating out a lot of BS that happened over the weeks.  Feel free to ask for more specific information

I was involved in an accident a little over a month ago.  The other party was found responsible.  I make contact with their insurance company (Progressive) to set up a time to have an adjuster look at the damage to my vehicle.

Vehicle is taken in for assessment on 5/2.  Progressive cuts a check for the damages and sends me on my way.

I phone up a gentleman who I met at a carwash and started talking to him about a vehicle he was getting cleaned.  I get to talking about the car he was driving and mention I like the work (it was plastidipped).  I inquire about those services and said I would be in touch after I get some other body work done on my vehicle.  He tells me that if I let his shop do the work he would cut me a break on the plastidip work.  Seems ok.  Here is where I screw up.

I looked up the shop online and verified via an online posting that was about a month old that he worked there.  On 5/2 I met up with him at the car rental agency and gave him my vehicle and a check made out to him for the amount of the estimate.

Several weeks pass by.  He has missed deadlines for when my car was supposed to be done.  He is my only point of contact until 5/21.  I contact the body shop directly and come to find out that this person was fired from the shop about 3 weeks ago

I eventually had to track this person down to their home (or what I thought was their home address).  This happens on 5/24.  The last words I spoke to this individual on 5/24 was that I wanted my car and money back to have the work done elsewhere.

Because I showed up to what I thought was his residence (his grandmother answered) he is upset with this.  He has told me that I have 2 options.  I have him finish the work

I have gone to the police and they believe this to be a civil matter (despite the value of my vehicle being above the $7000 limit for small claims and the misrepresentation on the individuals end) and they cannot do anything.  I went and spoke to my town prosecutor on 5/28 and after explaining the story to him

Near as I can tell

At this point, without the knowledge of the shop owner.  It would seem that this individual is defrauding the shop also.  They have been sympathetic to my situation and helpful in any way they can be at this point.

I would very much appreciate if anyone could provide me any bit of guidance that may result in the return of my car.  I feel like I've thought of everything I can do at this point and I am mentally exhausted.  I am hoping that someone out there could think of something I haven't thought of giving me that sort of ah-ha moment.

TIA.

I have already filed in small claims court for the amount of the check that I gave the individual.

To be clear, not just 2% of the $20.

I called Department of Labor (DOL)  and asked but the woman didn't seem to be all that knowledgeable

""Where tips are charged on a credit card and the employer must pay the credit card company a percentage on each sale, where a credit card company charges an employer 3 percent on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the tipped employee 97 percent of the tips without violating the FLSA. ""

http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs15.htm

The woman at DOL said ""Oh, but in fact if you charge 3% of the entire check then in that example you'd be paying the employee only 88% of their tip (2% of the entire sale is $2.40, subtract that from the $20 tip and that leaves $17.60, which is 88%). Is that how you read it?

It might seem a small point

I also found the Department of Labor's more detailed Field Operations Handbook and the relevant section (30d05) is similar but I think even more clear:

""Where tips are charged on credit cards

Any advice as to how I can get a definite answer to this? As I say, neither was Ohio Dept. of Commerce.

So, ""Why don't you just park out front, and we'll just carry all the stuff down the driveway to the truck.""  He nodded.  And then drove away.  This is noted on the tow truck receipt.

The next day, and that he'd still had an option to use his dad's AAA.  This guy (not the dad) OWNS this ""company,"" but he left behind his U-Haul contract, and obviously the dad had rented the truck, not him, so he probably didn't want to go that route because he shouldn't have been driving.

",7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18c1en/company_forced_me_to_stay_through_snow_storm_did/,"Ok, long wall of text here, but I want to get all the details in here.  I work in Connecticut. Most if not all of you are aware of how bad the storm hit here.  I work as a security guard. In our contracts it states that inclement weather is not an excuse for missing a shift, and my post is the only non 24 hr post on site.  If all the companies in the building are closed, you have to stay. But that they can't make you work for more than two shifts in a row.

Ok, but they close at 12.  I call my boss and tell him that all companies are closed, and I am going to go before the storm gets bad.  He informs me the 5-9 guard who comes in after me called out. Now we both work at the desk, however they are considered different posts. My post is to assist visitors to the companies here and monitor the lobby.  His post is to give out the cleaner's access cards at night, since the lobby is locked down to visitors.  So I argued with my boss a bit about how it's not the same post, and I have a sedan and needed to get home before the storm got bad, as I live in a hilly, and that he could give me a ride home if I didn't mind waiting the two hours. I said fine and that I'd leave my car there and come back Sunday for it.  I should mention he used the company gas card on his own vehicle specifically because he told all the guards in an email he would be providing rides to and from work for those who couldn't make it in themselves.

So I stay for the shift. The 3 cleaners who showed up grabbed their access cards from our officer instead of the desk, night crew comes in on their own. I text my manager to see if he is still providing rides are he stated in the emails he sent out. No response.  Our air mattress was ""misplaced"" several months ago.  And the mini fridge we had was taken by a guard who quit. So we have nowhere to store food for long periods of time, and nowhere to sleep. The only place we can sleep is in a ""Wellness Room"" provided by one company in the building. So I put on my hoodie and go to sleep there. The cot is old, torn up, and there are dirty tissues wadded up in the corner of the room. The pillow is yellow and covered in dirt. But I make the most of it. I wake in the morning from a phone call from my boss stating that the morning guards can't come in, asking if I can work till 3.  I say ok, I'm here anyway, he said he forgot and didn't hear the phone ring.  

So I work another shift, relief comes, and I attempt to go home.  Two towns over the roads are completely blocked, no way to get to my place or any of my friends or relatives.  So I decide to get a hotel for the night.  At this point, my left eye is really irritating and watery.  Not normal for me at all. It's bloodshot and runny.  Sunday morning I wake up and go to the Walk in clinic. I have pink eye.  And its the eye on the side that I always sleep on.  So I get some eye drops and inform my boss.  He tells me I still have to come in on Monday as he doesn't have anyone to cover. I tell him I'm contagious till Tuesday. He says just to wipe everything down with clorox wipes.  At this point I still can't go anywhere since I'll give any friends I stay with pink eye, so I take the hotel room for another night.

I should have planned to stay over  C.) It can't be proven I got the Pink Eye from the Cot, so they won't cover the medical expenses, and D.) The manager isn't obligated to provide rides to and from work.

1374876345.0,1j4iw6,[California] Car was towed from shopping center,LizardSkinz,20,0,11,"Ok so my car was towed from a shopping center yesterday. My car was parked for less than an hour and it was towed. 

* I arrived at the shopping center and noon and left before 1PM. For this reason I thought my car was stolen so I called the police and came to write up a report. After the cop was about to leave after writing the report they were informed that it was towed.  

It was not parked illegally nor where there any other issues. I had to pay for my car to be released and I lost half of my day.


So I started to do some research and tried to figure out why my car was towed. I called the property management at the shopping center. 

* The shopping center consists of 6 small shops/restaurants and one large store that has locations all over CA NV and TX so there is a property manager that rents the store location space and deals with security and parking.

After talking to the property manager he informs me that the security company that authorized to tow my car is not the one that he works with nor does the tow company. He also let me know that they never tow during the day and only do it at night times. I talked to the manager at the large store and he knows nothing about the company that towed my car. 

So after calling the property manager for the shopping center he informs me that it looks like the **assistant manager** for the large store signed a contract with some security company to patrol the parking lots.  He said that he had no prior knowledge and he did not authorized this to happen. The property manager was some what outraged that they took it upon themselves to do this without his authorization. 

I have tried contacting the large company's corporate office and after being transferred about 20 times I have not been able to get a word with them. 

What should I do? How can I go about getting my money back since it wasnt cheap to get my car out of the tow company. 


Here is a copy of paper the person signed to have my car towed http://i.imgur.com/GMbukX4.jpg


I also have the time that was written on the the tow notice and the time I called the police to show how long the car was parked for.  


tl;dr Car was towed while parked legally from Noon-1PM at shopping center. Security company that towed my car was not authorized to work at this shopping center.

I managed a chain of computer repair shops in VT and NH for about 7 years.  I left that job about 20 months ago, of false repairs to computers made by the fruit company (you know the one...they make things with i in the name; i'm just phrasing this way to reduce its google footprint).  He was fired, and several of the techs I hired were fired as well, even though they were following orders from this jerk after I was gone.  I reached out to contacts at said fruit company recently to ensure nothing happened under my watch.

Turns out, and he began doing bad things unbeknownst to me.  The response from top brass at the fruit company said I could never again work for them or anyone who sells their products.

I've been self employed since, I'd sure love me some health insurance though!  But I'm in regular contact with other resellers and service providers, and consult for them all the time.  If fruit company knew this, my clients could face penalties or deauthorization to sell iThings.  So, now I can't have that consulting income and have to explain to clients what happened, which is quite embarrassing even though I've done nothing wrong.

So, could he owe me for this royal ass plowing he's given me?

Huntington Debt Holdings purchased my debt from Fifth Third. They were be legally represented by Sterling Asset (something) out of New York. I was told that as of midnight tonight any of my bank accounts would have a hold

I told the person from Sterling that I would be at work at the time the person would show up at my house to serve me. She got very cold and threatened to contact my county and inform them that I would be dodging the summons and to show up at my work (I work 45 miles away in another county.) Also

Apartment was flooding very quickly and we were trying to contact the after-hour maintenance number. They said they can't say how long help will arrive. We decide to call a plumber. First one did not pick up. Second one said they do not have authority to come in the apartment. Call back the after-hour help and said they will dispatch someone and to just wait. 

We're on the 3rd floor. 2nd floor tenant came in to ask about the leak and decided to help out. 1st floor tenant come up and helped too

Got a callback and said that they need $300 to send someone over. I give credit card thinking apartment will reimburse me since it is after-hour help and office is closed. 

Firemen came and can't stop leak. took sink out and toilet. They asked for another truck to come in and they decide to find where main valve is (in a locked access room) and turn it off. They help suck up water from the carpet and left because there is nothing left to do but wait for maintenance.

Maintenance guy came and plumber at same time. Plumber check damage and list that pipe is broken and needs new fittings. Plumber asked maintenance guy if he will put sink and toilet back or if plumber will

Plumber said he can't start unless he gets a signature. Maintenance said to talk to manager about bill in the morning. So we sign it. All fixed now.

We talk to manager in the morning and she said regional seniors won't reimburse because plumber was not allowed to enter premises in the first place and that we signed the form. Maintenance guy should be the one putting back sink and toilet back and replacing valves and pipes. We tell her that **their maintenance guy was the one who asked plumber to do all this job in the first place.**

2) Everything is in his name.  The house

3) I'm divorcing because earlier this year my husband told me he had fallen in love with another woman and left to live with her and her children.  I will ask for child support and spousal support until I obtain employment.

4) The original agreement was he would continue to have his paycheck deposited into our joint account so I could pay the mortgage and bills on our house while I stayed here with our children.  He has lately been withdrawing funds leaving us short and hungry.  I fear being on the streets but cannot get government assistance while married to him as he earns too much.

My questions are

1) Divorce or separation?  It sounds like separation would still entitle me to his health insurance through work.  Would separation prevent me from collecting government assistance?  Things like rent vouchers or daycare for the kids when I can get a job is what I'm most concerned about.

Here's the long story (posted on askreddit but got deleted I think) and TL;DR at the end:

My laptop was stolen last september. I reported it to the police

The person who had it tried to use the computer's applecare (which I later cancelled and was partially refunded). To do this though they had to give information to Apple. I spoke to an applecare rep who told me he could not give *me* the information but if the police contacted them and used the case number they gave me

Fastforward to yesterday I got an email from the genius bar confirming my appointment for this weekend and an Apple store curiously near where my laptop was ""lost"". I went to said apple store yesterday to ask about what I could do/how did this email come to me. I was told they could not get involved because the person might have bought this laptop from someone else which is very possible. That I should go to the police and see what they can do.

The store manager I spoke to also told me I shouldn't show up at the store at the specified time because she didn't want **me** to get in legal trouble.

That said

**TL;DR:** My laptop was stolen

Any help is appreciated

----------------------

**UPDATE:**

1. I have not given up on the police.
2. I am going to the store's precinct this afternoon with my report stub from september and laptop's info.
3. I will not confront anyone on my own.
4. I am grateful for the help/advice.
5. If I was not willing to consider going to the police and/or was crazy/unreasonable I wouldn't be asking for advice before acting

1371416678.0,1gh38u,Defense against home owner's association,CraCkKRaCKKrakK,25,8,151,"Good morning, internet. I have a problem where I could benefit from the advice of a political science/administration of justice expert.

The story so far:
I have a German flag displayed in the bedroom window of my condominium and the Home Owner's Association is demanding that I take it down. I received letters warning about my ""unapproved window treatment"" and the looming recurring fines if I do not comply. I called their office and met with the board of directors and made clear that I have no intention of moving the flag, but it was not a promise to stop the harassment, it was a notice of their intent to fine as well as a second letter asking about ""my intentions"" for some potted plants I have in my front yard. This second letter appears to be a subtle threat of increased scrutiny as punishment for defiance.

I surveyed the complex and found several other window curtains of various colors and patterns - rainbows, stained glass mosaics, bamboo mats, etc. There was a curtain which looks similar to the German flag (horizontal bars of different colors) and the homeowner had heard nothing of it. There was even another flag! A torn Jamaican flag with a superimposed illustration of Bob Marley smoking a joint. It has become clear to me that the veteran was responsible for writing the violation not just because it is a flag, or its an aesthetically unpleasing color, but because it is a German flag.

Sure, but what type of pitiful man would disgrace their self and their fatherland by complying with such demand of prostration? Not the same type of man who would display a national flag. I have told them I would take the flag down if they could prove they have the authority to enforce these rules; anyone can just write any rule they want, but that does not make it legally enforceable.

What I know from my research:
The Davis-Sterling Common Interest Development Act (link 1) protects the rights of citizens to display non-commercial signs and flags within reasonable size and safety limits. The governing documents (CC&amp;R) cited to fine me are therefore illegal and invalid according to California Civil Code §1353.6 (link 2).

What I need:
Since they apparently ignored my cease and desist letter

Other info:
It is a modern German flag
I have spoken to many neighbors and no one has any objection to the flag. Most didn't even notice it as its on the second story facing away from the street.
The flag has been flying in that window now for at least 10 years.
I am a U.S. Citizen of German descent. I live in California.

1370292976.0,1fltk4,Company Expenses On Personal Credit Cards,dieseltroy,21,3,23,"...Work for a company that recently stopped issuing company credit cards and closed the accounts on them.  People must now solely use personal credit for business and travel expenses.  The problem is that now the company has gone into 30+ days expense reimbursement and paychecks are now in arrears.  This was once paychecks current and expenses reimbursed every 2 weeks.  It was nice.

Do most companies do this?  That is - require their sales, etc., personnel to front company expenses?  Not just travel related, but operating, trade show, office supplies, etc.  

I was asked to pay for several thousand dollars (`$6K) in expenses for the marketing department on my personal credit card that was not related to sales travel.   That's leveraging my credit and putting me at risk for something that should be a company operating expense and is part of their budget.

I think it is wrong

Being hit with interest penalties if not paid in full before the next billing cycle....with expense reimbursement taking a month at least

I feel like we are now loaning the company money/credit at no risk or financial penalty to the company.  The amount of money we're talking about could easily result in $100-500 or more in monthly finance charges.

10 days later, and at this point gave me the phone number to payroll so I could deal with them myself.

Long story short

I mailed the notarized affidavit to them via certified mail with return receipt. They received it on March 25. It is now May 7 and I STILL have not been paid.

Exasperated

My first question is, etc. because they failed to pay me on time (or at all)? It has been almost 3 months since I showed up to get my paycheck and they told me they couldn't find it. Granted, 2 weeks of that was me refusing to pay to get my affidavit notarized, but it still seems like an incredible length of time. The store manager for her part was extremely unhelpful; sat on it for several weeks, would say ""oh shit"" every time I reminded her I needed my paycheck. 

My second question is, based on the facts of this case? I know it's kind of david vs. goliath but I can't fathom how any reasonable-minded person wouldn't see that I have been treated unfairly. If it weren't for the fact I went to the labor board I don't think I would be ever getting paid at all.

Before the attack she was stomping around screaming and I knew she was about to get violent. She had taken my cellphone, but I dialed the number for emergency dispatch and when my sister left the room, I said ""Please help, I need help at [my address] right away.""

About half an hour passed and nothing happened - I snuck a peek and saw that the call had been disconnected - so I tried again, and she caught me, and then started choking me.

When I regained consciousness she had left the house. I quickly connected my laptop (she had thrown it on the floor, and called dispatch again. I gave my address, the dispatcher asked what my emergency was, and I told them I had been attacked and that I needed help immediately. I stayed on the line with the dispatcher until police arrived.

The officer was someone I knew. He did not believe I had been choked

My dad and mom have been separated, the one he and my mom purchased together. 

My dad married NCW in December of last year and claimed her and one or both of her two children on his 2012 tax returns. NCW does not have a job, does not grocery shop, does not do anything a normal, functioning adult does. She has never held a job, just uses her child support to 'pay' for things, even though her online shopping (gotta love that QVC) pretty much cancels out any money she would contribute to the running of the household. 

My dad does not have legal custody of her two children, or any other woman, because she's crazy enough to immediately call the police to get him arrested for defending himself (that's not how the police will see it, we all know this). She has chased away all of my dads friends and family, won't allow him to get a second job and uses any money left after THEIR bills, that HE pays, to pay off HER credit card after buying crap online. 

They own no property together, but I'm not 100% sure on this. I know they have a joint bank account. 

My dad has had enough, which really isn't much at all. That's why he cannot afford a lawyer to discuss this with. 

My plea to you lovely redditors at /r/legaladvice is advice about how he can escape from NCW with his property still intact. Is she entitled to anything? Especially his house, and that was only like 1-2 jobs that she just quit because she 'can't handle it'.

**Background**
The back story is really long

**The Legal Situation**
Recently she found a living situation where an older man would give her a place to sleep, in exchange for cleaning/running his house and who knows what else. That seemed much better to her than paying rent with money that she didn't have so she asked me to help her sublet her apartment. I kept saying I didn't want to because I was trying to distance myself from her but she begged and then I agreed to do it for a finders fee. I found some folks off craigslist who were willing to pay her rent+$200 extra per month. I took the first $200 and gave her their contact info and everything. I didn't get their last names or emergency contact info or anything, but figured she would. I'm not the leasing agent, I'm just the one who made her house look pretty and took pictures and posted it up on craigslist.

Anyway they paid the first month in full but now it's the second month and I guess they haven't paid her

Now she is threatening to sue me (and them I guess) since I was the original contact with these people, etc. I gave her their phone numbers, gave her their email, gave her the last name that I am aware of, but that's all the info I had. I never gave them a contract. All I established with them was a verbal agreement and then passed them on to my Abby. It was never clear between Abby and I what my responsibilities of being the finder were, but *I am not a leasing agent or a property manager*, and I was just helping my friend find some folks to sublet. 

**The Harassment**
I've been on vacation for three weeks and shit has really hit the fan. 

* She is texting me dozens of times a day sending me really awful things, and my folks have requested I keep my phone on me so that if we split up in groups, that both groups have a phone. Anyway, the last thing I texted her a few minutes ago was an explanation that I've given her all the info of that I had, and then I requested yet again that she stop contacting me. I also said if she's really going to sue, then any further contact from her needs to be through her lawyer.

* My dog is with a pet sitter while out of town. Abby has been harassing the pet sitter trying to get my dog. She started doing this before shit hit the fan

* Abby is best friends with another psycho girl (Cate) who is my boyfriend's roommate. My boyfriend has already given Cate her 30 day's notice to GTFO but legal action might have to be taken there to actually get her out. Abby is not allowed in my boyfriend's house anymore but she sneaks in anyway when he's not home (they have memorized his work schedule). We are really worried that she is going to steal things or plan something violent

**Solutions?**

* Does Abby have a case against me? She obviously has a case against the tenants who aren't paying

* What can I do to stop the harassment? I don't want the texts

She began renting her current place in April of this year on a 1 year lease. Immediately she noticed that the downstairs neighbors spend all hours of the night shouting at each other, went to the landlord, who stated that they'd been there much longer and that it was my friend's problem to deal with. She informed him that she probably wasn't going to be able to stay there with the noise, and he said he'd let her leave as long as she gave thirty days notice.

So we looked for apartments. Currently we're waiting to hear back on a rental for the 15th. My friend was just going to take the hit with the two week crossover. Over the last month or so she's left him numerous voicemails stating her intention to move out soon

Today I got a call from her saying she spoke with her landlord. Turns out our potential landlord called him for a reference. The current landlord stated that he told the potential one that my friend never said anything about her intention to move and said she hadn't paid her rent since the first month (she has records of each month's rent checks

He then stated 'Guess I screwed that up for you

To be clear, seeing as even if we get the apartment, it's not until the 15th.

I work as a security guard in an office building. One night last week a couple of carpet cleaners came in asking to be let into an office, which I did, but this time somehow happened to miss the corresponding work order. Thus I told the carpet cleaners I couldn't give them access until I contacted building management, as is policy. I called building management, but no one picked up the phone, so I told the carpet cleaners they'd have to wait until I got a response. They responded that they didn't have time to wait around and left the site.

The next day I come to work and my supervisor shows me where the work order I missed was

Now my supervisor wants me to sign something saying I am personally liable for any financial repercussions my mistake may have made. Is this legal? What are my options here? Generally,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,t3_1gx4ke
1372008674.0,1gx0u5,Suing My Doctor,NoForReally,18,2,20,"In November of 2010 one of the discs in my back became ruptured.  I went to my primary care doctor who referred me to a pain management doctor.  I worked with him getting cortisone shots and doing PT

He finally suggested that I have surgery and referred me to a surgeon. He ordered an MRI as and after looking it over decided that my best option was to put a wedge between the slipped discs and then screw it all together using brackets.

After the surgery

I lost feeling in the back of my legs and also in my most private area (my husband hates this the most)  I was told that would be temporary

I finally got to a new surgeon who looked at my old MRI and ordered a new one.  He said that I have Degenerative Disc Disease and it was clear even in the first MRI.  He said the first surgeon shouldn't have done that type of surgery for a condition that is degenerative.  He also mentioned that the first surgery done Haas's a very high failure rate and most surgeons don't do it anymore.

When I had the second surgery, removed the black discs and then fused the vertebrae together there.

I healed well from that surgery and would have gone back to work, we had to downsize. We went from California to Washington State. 

Another unfortunate side effect from the first surgeon's blunder, I was prescribed them for almost 2.5 years. One day I realized that I was completely addicted! I know it sounds lame, but I really didn't think that I would be prescribed something so long that would hurt me so bad.  To be honest, I don't know much about drug use.

It was only this last week that I detoxed off of oxy-contin and on my own.... It was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I'm still feeling its affects on my body.  

I just think that if my first surgeon had really looked at my MRI that this whole mess would have been much less.  I don't want to be the person to sue a doctor

1371132413.0,1g9njq,I'm being stalked. What do I do? (FL) (x-post from /r/rbi),imbeingstalkedhelp,22,5,15,"Hi. I was told to come here by the nice people at /r/rbi. Here's my story:

I'm an immigrant to the U.S. and I met my future-husband in 2006 and we got hitched in 2010. After we got married, so in turn, I got a boyfriend.

I joined a dating site in early 2013, and then due to my unresolved past, he decided to end things with me.

Fast forward to April. Al randomly texts me professing his love and desire to be with me forever. At this point, I noticed my car tires were slashed, and my license plate stolen. Ironically enough, I get a call the very same morning from Al inquiring how I'm doing, etc. I explain I'm not doing so well due to the car, and he offers his help with my car. Being a damsel in distress, I accept his offer to help me with my car trouble, etc. Because I was very stressed

After our casual hook up, and ignoring my requests to be left alone (I didn't want a relationship). One day, I received a 5 page letter addressed to the U.S. Immigration Department, in detail, outlining numerous false accusations stating my initial marriage was bullshit (fraud/federal crime). Although false, these accusations could lead to me being deported and my husband being sent to federal prison. The conditions he offered for not sending the letter would be for me to date him and have a family with him. Although I could prove these allegations are false, it would cost a lot of money, etc. and I don't really want to make more trouble for myself (i.e. my husband and I are separated. I don't want the govt. looking into it anyways). Al also told me that if he couldn't have me

As days went by and I didn't respond to his threats, state, or country, he would always follow me until I agreed to his conditions. He would randomly come to my apartment and sit on the doorstep awaiting my arrival. He would post things on my social media accounts, tag me in creepy pictures, message me with threats, the most threatening one being he would follow me until one of ""us"" dies.

Around this point, I grew more paranoid because throughout the day I would receive non-stop text messages from him accusing me of lying to him (in general) and telling me he knew where I was at that exact time. More paranoia sets in and even when driving on the interstate, I couldn't stop looking around me out of fear he was following me. Taking my friend's advice, I ended up going to the police and getting the documentation needed for a restraining order. I filled it out and turned it in.

The next day, Al got a restraining order against me, telling the police everything he did to me I did to him. Another surprise was that the person who handed me the restraining order papers handed me the wrong papers and the restraining order was never filed. On top of all this, Al told the police I was unstable and was threatening to commit suicide. As it is in many states, accusations like this are not taken lightly and when the police came and got me from my apartment, I was taken to the mental institution (in handcuffs) for a 72 hour psych-evaluation.

When I got out today,"" he has continued to message me on my social media accounts telling me to put everything he has done in the past and begs me to start a family with him.

I've had to re-do my restraining order paperwork

I am a certified Foster Parent in Oregon.

I have no criminal background.

My home has been deemed safe through multiple state workers.

Due to me being a foster parent



So here is what happened:
One of my older sister came to visit with her boyfriend and their son, as I have two of my own and have fostered as well.

Another older sister of ours started becoming involved, and attempting to blackmail me by saying she would call child services on me if I did not cut off all contact to sister A's now ex, which I have no reason to do.

I have no reason to worry about the threat of calling child services, even though I have had no contact with sister B since February. She is using this to attempt to control sister A's parenting methods (sister B has had trouble with child services many times due to improper parenting with her first two, although this was more than ten years ago when I was a teen).

I personally feel due to her aggressive nature that she is a threat to my family's well being

On top of that, harassment which went unchecked for years made him suicidal. Help me help him before I get the call from his mom that he's dead.",hiphopapotamus1,18,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dcnji/my_good_friend_and_former_coworker_sustained_a/

While working in a hospital an employee and two coworkers attempt to assist a man from a chair to a bed. The man was 350-400 lbs and could support perhaps 15% of his weight. The employee asks to use a hoyer lift to assist. The nurse leading the lift refuses as he believes its a waste of time. The man drops straight down rapidly. The employee is unable to guide this patient's fall or even let go to protect himself and he sustains an injury.

The injury was such that the majority of the muscles on his back were having spasms and were useless. The employee had to be taken to the ER. After a few hours and some pain/anti-inflammatory meds the pain and spasms were still present but subdued enough for the employee to go home. No tests were done.

The ER in the hospital in which the employee works and received treatment gave instructions to not go to work for at least 1 week for reevaluation. Percocet was prescribed. The very next day the employee was scheduled for a shift. The employee was not able to sleep due to the continued spasms and claims to have taken the percocet at night before bed. He also did not consider it his responsibility to call the floor and tell him that he wasn't allowed to work considering that his work was the entity that told him not to come in from the start. As such he did not call out the next day. In fact he was pretty much knocked out until after his shift was due to start because of the prescribed percocet anyway. Furthermore apparently the hospital initiated a claim with their insurance for him. That means that The ER knew he was injured, it should have also been stated that he would not be coming back due to the injury until one week later. They considered his absence a no call no show and stated that they had no idea he hurt his back. The employee was put on a 6 month probationary period in which a written warning was issued. This allowed grounds for termination should another no call no show occur.

Fast forward 5 and a half months later. No call outs. however the employee cannot work as often as he would like. Whenever he works 3 or more days straight he claims the spasms manifest. He still takes no action against the facility. He simply works as often as he can. Suddenly he gets sick. He's violently throwing up around the time his shift is scheduled to start. He, he claimed it was back drip/allergies/just getting over a cold, but it only held him up. He explains that he WILL be coming in to work and that he will just be late by about 45 mins. Had he intended to call out the proper protocol would be to call the nursing office at 1. The shift starts at 3. He however was not calling out. The charge nurse then instructed him to not come in since he was retching. He tried to fight it since he needs his shifts but inevitably complies.

Management then considers this a no call no show and terminates the employee after an unofficial two week period in which he was told he was not allowed to pick up shifts.

The employee cannot find a job that invokes his skill set that doesn't require heavy lifting of people (which as per numerous in-services is considered 'never safe' but can be made safer.)

The employee is seeing a shrink for the abuse he received on the floor Apparently an employee who later became assistant manager called him gay in front of his girlfriend while at work, if you cant handle her, (Name of another male coworker) will take care of her for ya."" This statement broke them up, and caused him to get extremely depressed. The depression also coincides with the general feeling of not being liked by a group of maybe 3 nurses who turned the entire atmosphere into High school. Again, the nurse who made that comment is now assistant manager... Inappropriate touching/comments, not documenting things and just saying quite literally ""fuck it"" aloud for other coworkers to hear, treating good nurses like shit because of some extra curricular factor like hobbies, he's past that. He's tried numerous times since then and has been seeing a therapist for it. In a span of a year he lost his job and GF and was left with nothing but back pain

I work with him and I am furious FOR him. He is too dejected and is pretty much giving up on life. I literally watched an extremely intelligent, socially gifted and naturally funny guy turn into a sack of shit who doesn't leave the house.. I've worked there for 4 years, he's been there for 6. This job was his first he feels like its his last due to his back pain and overall demeanor change. Some of his ""friends"" stopped talking to him since he can't go out and unwind with the rest of them like he used to. I'm just shocked at how someone who I know is better than me in more ways than I want to admit give up on life. I'm pretty much holding him by the hand now and will be helping him get at the very least workman's comp.

In september a 60 foot block wall running the length of the side of my house fell. We share this wall with our neighbors to left.

These are the neighbors from hell, and there were rats running through our backyard for a couple months after, completely the fault of her. Her lawn is dead, she has tinfoil over the windows as blinds, garbage littered on her lawn, it's really just disgusting. She lives there with her older granddaughter, in her later twenties, it has now been put into a trust

When the wall fell, which was alright because we considered it to be our wall. We are not exactly sure who's property it falls on, but I doubt her brother, who is handling the whole suing process will pay the $2500 for a surveyor.

The basic gist, and no low-level AT&amp;T employee has ever heard of it. My employer was ending their company-paid mobile phones, and I had to port the number to my personal phone if I wanted to keep it.

AT&amp;T told me the only way to do that, and then move the number from the AT&amp;T personal to my carrier's personal.

In doing this

I've talked to AT&amp;T customer care, AT&amp;T executive escalations, the BBB, Attorneys General, and nothing will change AT&amp;T's stance.

I even got an AT&amp;T Executive Escalations rep in trouble for trying to help me.

1353390218.0,13huz7,In need of some advice: My dad hit a man with his car last night. It was a fatality. I need to know what to do/expect...,getinthegoat,16,1,32,"My Background: I work in the auto insurance industry and I am very well versed and familiar with auto liability and driving laws but not at a fatality level. I have already handled the vehicle damage issues

Facts:
My dad was driving to my home to have a short visit. It was 7:30 pm (fully dark), however where the pedestrian came out from wasn't directly under a light. My dad was traveling in the #2 lane out of 3 northbound lanes (essentially the middle travel lane). My dad doesn't speed and he told me he was going 40 (I believe him because he drives annoying slow sometimes). He had been almost one block away from a major intersection when the pedestrian walked right in front of my dads vehicle. 

The impact on the vehicle (Jeep Wrangler) was the very center grill

This area is mixed residential and urban. At the major intersections back there are things like gas stations and shops and a major drug store. Then after about one block that is when you get into the residential. Where this pedestrian was coming from was what looked like a pizza place parking lot and the alley behind the residential homes. It's not the most well lit area and there isn't a cross walk anywhere near it. 

My dad: 69 years old. Of sound mind and body. He can still see good to my understanding. No drugs. No alcohol. Wide awake. He was only three miles from his home and only two more miles to get to my house. I asked him if he saw the person before it happened and he said the man got in front of the vehicle suddenly and he couldn't do anything.

Apparently there are several witnesses that appear to be siding in dads favor. The police allowed us to take our vehicle on our own. No impound. No arrests. I got dad a warm meal and took him home. 

The police originally said the man appeared to be a drunk transient but today I found out he does have family that came looking for him last night to help him with his laundry. 

Now I sit here and wait. Wait for the police report. Wait for a toxicology report (from the pedestrian). Wait for this family to appear and see if they will look for compensation. I am worried to death about my father and our family as my dad did not give him the best limits of liability coverage and no money put away.

1373715398.0,1i7p6q,[NY] Do I have a medical malpractice case?,stabbedbyadoctor,17,1,10,"I’m not sure if I have a medical malpractice case

In late May, according to the doctor who made the diagnosis, but they wanted the surgery done ASAP. I wearily agreed, and they took me into surgery. Instead of a laparoscopic appendectomy, I was advised to have an open appendectomy; despite being a female in my early 20’s, quite healthy, and thin (open appendectomies are usually advised for obese and/or elderly patients). In addition, which is a secondary reason why open appendectomies are performed. It should be noted that

When I came home- less than 24 hours after the surgery- I was given a prescription for Loritab but no antibiotics. As a result, and the site had grown increasingly painful (I couldn’t sit up on my own, and could only sleep by folding my knees up so that I wasn’t stretching my stomach muscles). I went to the office of the surgeon (from herein referred to as “Doctor A”) but he was unavailable, so I was seen by his associate “Doctor B”. Doctor B advised me that, although the area was red and the incision had grown in size, there was no infection. There was no swab of the area done, he just looked at it for about 30 seconds.

Two days later I returned to see Doctor A, and it has become extremely difficult for me to walk because of the area of the infection and its level of sensitivity. Doctor A states that the area is infected, and prepares to remove the staples. At this point, I ask if I can have some form of pain medication or go to the hospital, but Doctor A refuses. He takes a scalpel and pops open the strained staples (they were strained and distorted because of the increased size of the incision area) and proceeds to cut into my abscess. At this point, I am screaming in agony – I have never experienced this level of pain before- and I’m begging him to stop. Doctor A continues to cut into the abscess, a process that took between 5-10 minutes. I’m crying and screaming, and that I am not to do it by myself.

Well, when all of a sudden, the nurses stopped visiting. I called and asked why, and they said it was because Doctor A’s office had ordered only two days worth (the wound would take approximately 6-10 weeks to heal). I called Doctor A’s office back, and the nurse stated that I should be able to get someone else to pack the wound for me. I told her that I had no close friends or family in the area (I had only moved to this city two months prior), and that I would need the nurses to continue to visit until the wound got small enough to pack myself. She reluctantly agreed. The nurses continued to visit for another week, when suddenly, and I managed to argue with Doctor A’s office until it was reversed. I was afraid that the infection would re-emerge without proper care

During this time, when I told her that the loritab was really not mitigating my pain and I had been taking Motrin instead, she called Doctor A’s office to ask for either an increased strength of Loritab or an alternative painkiller. Doctor A’s office called me later that day and directed me to discontinue the Loritab and instead take OTC Motrin. When I told her that I had been taking Motrin and it was not decreasing my pain levels, she told me to continue that.

About three weeks into the nurses visits, although there’s some amount of tissue damage (one side of the incision is deeply indented. In addition, there is scarring (vertical, approx. 1 inch long) from when one staple was pulled up and through my skin during the removal. 

I feel like my recovery was impeded- multiple times- by the actions of the Doctor A and his office. From doing research online and talking to various nurses, but I feel like this might infringe on “negligence” territory. 

What most concerns me, why I wasn’t taken to a hospital operating room for the procedure, and why the doctor continued to performing the procedure after I was screaming at him to stop. I’m not sure if I should pursue this as a lawsuit or report it to a medical review board. I’m not even sure how I can prove my case if it comes down to it, but I’m open to any suggestions because I really don’t want to see someone else go through this. 

Thank you in advance for any help or advice!

The issues: 

* 1) He has not received his 8x10

* 2) The disc she provided was a single layer DVD in which all of the roughly 700 images have been compressed and image resolution lowered down to roughly 2-3MP. All of her images were taken with a Canon 5D Mark II which is a 21.1 MP sensor and raw image resolution of 5

WTF!? So at this point my wife and I's blood is just boiling we're so mad. He proceeds to tell us he called the bank. They gave him our account balances, and to call the authorities!! His wife is still on the phone with the police giving them our descriptions and letting them know where we are. 

So my wife logs into our account on her iphone and shows him the cashiers check withdrawal

They go on to apologize

While driving my wife calls the bank again to talk with this guys manager. If this guy suspected fraud he should have suspended all our accounts, our address, names, etc.. in the account notes for anybody who accesses our account next to see. 

Anyhow they called us back a few days later and told us that they terminated the guys employment.

So lets look at the big picture here.. This representative gave out all our account info, then advised them to actually call the cops. All the while never flagging our account as fraud or suspicious activity or nothing. Also had we not stopped for lunch we would have been an hour out of town on the highway with the cops probably chasing us down.

I'm not looking for advice on how to safely break the law. I am only concerned about the rights I have as the apartment renter.

Say the police knock on the door and someone else answers. Does the cop have a right to ask to speak to a tenant or can the person answering the door do all the talking? 

Does the tenant have the right to refuse to open the door or speak to the cop?

Can I just tell him to get a warrant and come back?

Utilities are included in the rent. I have lived in the apartment since December and will be moving out in June. The landlord was in the apartment showing it to a future lessor. The landlord had also entered the apartment in January for repairs. All of these devices were in the apartment except for the PC and monitor at that time.

First

* power strips
* 2 TV's
* major computer monitor
* fan
* 2 laptops
* XBOX
* router
* not to mention the hotplate

First of all

On the other side of the apartment I have a power strip with the TV and 2 game consoles plugged in. Are these devices using a lot of power even when they are off?

I have a laptop but do not leave it plugged in when I leave the apartment. The external hard drive is usually off when I leave as well ( occasionally I forget). 

However, and microwave are in the same area of the apartment. While the fridge is always plug in I NEVER plug the PC, micro wave, and hot plate in at the same time. I always make sure only one of those devices is plugged in at a time. I never use the game consoles and television at the same time as the PC. The laptop is very rarely on if the PC is on. 

The fan is small (less than 12""). I rarely use it and only started using it once or so every night now that it's started getting hot.

Utilities are included in the apartment rent. The section for utilities in the lease says ""Lessor shall be responsible for arranging for paying for all other utility services to the named apartment. Lessor shall provide wireless internet that is for casual use only. Any Lessee with excessive bandwidth usage is recommended to subscribe to DSL

If I'm using too much electricity than so be it. I've never lived in a studio before so I am wondering if the limits are different than a 1 BR apartment. I just really don't want to get screwed over in the event that I am not using excessive electricity but my landlord thinks I am.

The next day, asking him if this person was representing the board in an official capacity, and letting him know that they were quite disrespectful to my family.  And then I asked him for the code, since I was not sure I even had the correct phone number.

His response to me was that this woman was his wife

I responded by again asking for the code

The response was even more offensive:

*The courts are meant for people who are going to use them as tennis courts and be good citizens.*

Last night I was at a state park lake (after hours) with a large group of friends. There was plenty of alcohol and pot. However, tested each of us with breathalyzer and the ""ballpoint pen"" field sobriety test (drivers only) and promptly picked us (again, drivers) up off the ground and slapped handcuffs on us and threw us into their patrol vehicles. There were a few others who had felony possession within 1000 feet of a school or park slapped on them, as well as some misdemeanor possession charges (the misdemeanors fessed up when asked if they had any pot.) We were all under the age of 21. Everyone who was not driving or did not confess to possessing marijuana (and didn't have the K9 hit on them) was allowed to leave by way of people picking them up, no matter their obviously drunken states.

Additionally

I have a few questions:

* Can I get the charge dismissed for an improper arrest (no rights or anything)?
* Why was my identification not returned to me? 
* How can I be arrested for public intoxication if the breathalyzer blew .000 and I (as far as I know) ""passed"" the field sobriety test?

I am currently facing criminal charges in Indiana. I have hired an attorney who was recommended to me by several people

1. I have never met with him on time, leaving many questions unanswered and left feeling very frustrated.

2. He's missed court twice. - Once he sent another attorney to appear for him, and then sat in court for 4 hours on something that would have taken 45 minutes tops had he shown up. No one knew and I eventually had to ask a court worker, who then found my case on the attorney's desk waiting for him to show up. The second time was last Thursday. I had talked to him two days before on Tuesday and he told me specifically ""just meet me in the lobby at 10 (my scheduled court time), they change the rooms for these meetings and even I don't know where it will be."" I waited in the lobby from 9:30 until 10:15. I called his cell and he picked up and immediately hung up on me so I called the office and asked about him. His secretary said ""I know ____ is running late but I've emailed him. You should ask where they are doing such and such arguments, they'll tell you where to go"". Finally finding the correct room I waited until all cases were cleared and my name was not said. I was finally able to ask the judge who then looked up the case on the docket saying ""Mr. ______ has already appeared this morning and the date has been rescheduled for xx/xx/xx"" Not only did he not meet me like he said he would, he appeared, rescheduled the date

I live in Seattle, plus a drummer. The drummer was found through a friend of the frontman and although he's 22 years old, he's relies incredibly on his parents and has little independence. Although a strange situation, he fit the bill for our band and was an okay drummer so we used him. 

The frontman and I had been in contact with an entertainment attorney for a few years before the band was founded and before we knew the drummer. We also have a finalized contract that gives the frontman and I 50/50 ownership over the band.

Late last year we decided to record a full-length album at a professional recording studio that the frontman (lets call him Paul) and I had frequented for a few years. The two of us worked night jobs while attending college to pay for the recording ourselves and we asked if the drummer (lets call him Nick) wanted to help pitch in. Although Nick works a full-time job at a restaurant and doesn't go to school and still lives with his parents

Fast forward a year. The record is finally done (took forever to work to pay for it) and Nick decides he wants to quit the band even though his parents have invested $1, that they wouldn't press charges or attempt to claim royalties on the album. Since recording started a year ago, Nick's parents have become increasingly hostile because they didn't agree with the band's direction that Paul and I were taking it in. (Nick comes from a hard rock/metal background)

Sorry for the wall of text, trying to screw over two already-broke college students. We're not even done paying for the work that has already been done by the studio staff, (we're kind of on loan with the owner) and obviously this kind of thing is non-refundable anyways. 

Also, but our attorney is pricey to consult, so I'd like to be a little knowledgeable on the situation when we talk with the attorney. What are my options here?

1370988600.0,1g5jdb,Landlord evicted me for complaining to HUD?,DaveyTheCat,15,0,6,"Hello. Long time lurker on Reddit

I am currently on a HUD assisted rental in WV

Today my landlord and his wife came to my door and told my husband that, he couldn't get a word in since they refused to let him speak.

The reason?

We had a HUD inspector come to our door on the 2nd of June(this month) and he saw a couple unresolved things about this apartment that needed to be fixed but never were. 

1. Electrical box above stove was never covered. Landlord received notification from HUD about that before we moved in. We made note of it to the landlord for two months after, or ""Let me look around and see if I can find something.""

2. Water pressure was poor. The day the HUD inspector came over the water pressure was at 40% of what it is on a good day. The water came out in under half of the holes in the shower head nozzle. There have been days when water has only come out of two holes and we have had to sponge bath and boil water. We've reported this issue twice.

The landlord was infuriated because the HUD inspector wrote them up and gave a report of ""our complaints"". They said

The landlord's wife(the owner of the property) yelled at us

We have complained trice about the upstairs neighbor stomping so loudly it makes the glass rattle. The upstairs renters have a child who has lately been running around at 12:30am and 2am. We debated on calling the police

We've also reported to the landlord a few other issues the needed to be fixed or made aware of:

1) Draft in door. Was fixed by landlord.

2) Toilet was leaking and reaching the bedroom carpet.

3) Kitchen floor heater was faint

4) Ceiling fan was rattling and just needed a bit of cardboard to prop it.

5) Bedroom floor heater fell off the wall. That was fixed.

My husband and I have kept quiet about the fact there was a mouse in the house and the fact the heating was poor when the bedroom heater fell off it's mount(fire hazard

What I would like to know is:
1) Can landlord legally evict people for ""complaining to HUD"" or ""complaining too much"" about issues that need repair?

2) How can I avoid being evicted at all? Do landlord need even the most miniscule of reasons to evict?

3) What should I do if the landlord and his wife come back and yell at us again like they did today? They were so rude

4) How do I prevent the landlord's wife from keeping any damage deposit? She is threatening to keep next month's damage deposit if we don't pay rent for July. I don't know how to protect us from that

This is only my second rental. There was no year contract

My motives for telling him all this were that I didn't want him knocking on my door if the project got too ""big"" for his comfort.  He sent me a message back (this is through Facebook messages) that says:  ""You can use the name.  This message serves as confirmation.  Maybe somehow we can both benefit from this!""  For the record, he perform shows as ""The Safaris with Jeffrey Stewart"" and my moniker would be ""Safaris""; a somewhat distinguishable difference, in my opinion, but then again, I have no idea.

So here I am- excited, this guy is doing *way* less musically with ""The Safaris"" than the person is doing with ""The Flamingos"".  Terry Johnson of the Flamingos just got inducted to the Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame and is still performing.  This guy of The Safaris owns a portrait studio, does a small gig every few months, and has 105 likes on Facebook.

SO: am I legally in the clear?  Do I need to also contact a record label from the '60s

Also, memorable band names.

1369734920.0,1f6w79,Someone pretends to be hit by our car,justiceinspain,16,4,6,"Dear people of Reddit

I am a Dutch ICU nurse that is living with my wife and two children in Spain.
We used to rent a house of a (Dutch) woman but had to stop that because
she did not do any maintenance. Since we left we are having a lot of 
problems with this woman. Even though she still owes us a lot of money she 
is on our back with the most ridiculous accusations. Recently she even 
threatened to kill my son (2) and me. We found out that she stalked an
English girl (12!) years ago and threatened to burn her. 
Some time ago this woman waited with two male friends in front of
the school of our eldest one. She had no business being there. When
my wife arrived she jumped in front of our car. Luckily my wife stopped.
She then walked to the side of the car and grabbed the head of my wife
through the open window. My wife accelerated and she let herself fall on the 
pavement pretending as if she was hit by the car. After parking the car my wife
spoke to her briefly but was threatened by the two men
Apparently the woman was examined in the hospital and the report states she has 
some bruises. My wife and I went to the police straight afterwards and
filed a report. Accompanied by a hospital report stating that my wife had some 
scratches in her neck from the attack.
The case is now in court. We talked to our lawyer yesterday. We have one witness that saw the part when she was next to the open window of the car and let herself drop. The two friends that were with that woman at that moment testified as well. 
They say the woman was dragged 30 meters by the car
It is very difficult for us to get other witnesses because most Spanish parents do not want to get into trouble with this ‘mad bad lady’. 
Our lawyer told us he cannot garantee that justice will be at our side.
(What is wrong with this world?)
We are in Spain but any advice from around the globe would be very welcome.
What is the best option to proceed in this case?

Thanks a lot.

1369163619.0,1es5qp,"Ex couldn't handle son, volunteered him to me, child support issues.",Krystofer,16,4

Child custody/support issues are complicated, and I apologize.

My ex has custody of both of our children

just over 6 weeks ago my ex called me frantic and in tears... ""I can't deal with it anymore, I don't care about the child support, I just can't do it anymore"".  After calming her down a bit, she revealed to me the following...

1) My son (9)

2) She can't handle him at home.  He won't do chores

3) He fights with my daughter (13) constantly and the two are always screaming at each other.  (daughter also refuses to help around the house and is a snotty little brat).

When they are at my house, just... kids.  They will do them when instructed.  I explain this to my ex and she says I must be living in a fantasy world, to which I ask what kind of rules and guidelines they have at her house.  She explains that she just started giving them chores in the past 2 months (now nearly 4 months ago), and expecting behavior changes from them.  I tried to explain that you can't suddenly drop rules on top of kids who have largely had none for most of their life.  I also explained that I only have them for what amounts to about 4 days of the month, so what little I do accomplish is undone in their time with her, so I understand her frustration to some extent.

She asks me to help her, and to hang in there for just a bit longer, she then informs me she's been reported to CPS.

Whenever she (my ex) would do the laundry, and eventually someone called CPS.  The truth behind her sudden frantic need for rescue finally revealed, I tell her it's going to take some sorting out, but I'll get back to her in the morning with SOMETHING to sort this mess out.

When I do call her the next day, we came up with a plan to help him, but it was made very clear his sister was welcome, and planned for.  She flips her shit and screams ""how dare you try to take my kids away"" and ""i'm the best goddamn mother there is""...so on.  I try my best to talk sense into her over the next 4 or 5 back and forth phone calls, she is absolutely ""no, you can't have them.  You can pay for them like every other asshole that ruins some girls life because he wants to be a daddy.  If you want them so bad, get a lawyer, everything here will be straightened out and you'll look like a prick, but reminded me he doesn't practice anymore and is out of touch with the current laws in TX.

About 2 hours after my lengthy talk with my uncle, and asking if my offer to take my son fulltime still stands ""Of course, daughter too if need be""  She refuses to give them both over, but agrees to let my son finish the school week, then pull him out and bring him over full time.  A seemingly small victory in nearly 7 years of bullshit bickering and irrational bitchmode shenanigans.

Fast forward 6 weeks to today.  She texts me asking if I've paid my child support, thats why I've still not had enough money to get this poor boy some new glasses.  Since we're on the subject, would it be possible to work something on on that?"".

""don't be an asshole.  You have a second income.  I have to pay for everything with credit cards because I can't afford these kids as it is""

She has voluntarily given me full custody of my son, I also have 3 other children (5 in total, yes you read that right).  We are not on welfare, we are debt free.  Money is fairly tight right at the moment having to pick up all the things my son needs for more than a 2 day visit, and feed him full time, AND pay child support to her... for him.  What seems ""right"" to me may not be what is ""right"" by law, I understand that.  It bears mention my ex makes considerably more than I do, brings home just under $2 an hour less than my wife and I combined, a bigger, so his appetite is back and kicking my pantries ass.  It was entirely worth it

My question is, and at what point SHOULD I file, and subsequently file for child support?  I am in DFW Texas.  I can't get a straight answer from the child support office, and my uncle isn't honestly sure, usually custody only changed hands at the order of the court, and he's 10+ years retired.  I'm only looking for a pointer in the right direction, and how I should proceed from here.  I want to just run out and file shit behind her back and slap her in the face with it, however justified I may feel it is.",t5_2rawz,True

* Since the first leak
* Repairs were delayed for several months
* The repairs that have been completed have been absolutely ineffective. It leaks today just as badly as it did in January.
* My landlord has agreed to let me terminate my lease early

**Details**

* **1/30/13** - During a hard rain storm, from above the window that looks into my kitchen, and from above the large entry way to my kitchen. There was no property damage -- I moved my items quickly -- but over a 30ish minute period, three large rubbermaid bins were half full with what water I was able to catch. I immediately called ""Alice"", my contact with the company that manages my property. She said there would be someone out to inspect the roof as soon as possible.

* **1/31/13** - Alice calls at 8am

* **2/6/13** - I meet the roofer ""Joe"" at my apartment. Without prompting, explain what Joe has told me. She says Joe told her the walls need to be sealed, but she has no knowledge that apartment has leaked before.

* **2/16/13** - I haven't heard from Alice or Joe

* **3/21/13** - Unrelated repairs are made to better soundproof a wall in my bedroom that I share with a business. I email Alice asking when repairs for the leak will start. Her reply email: ""We are working with the roofer to get that area sealed.  Currently in line for scheduling.  As soon as we hear back from him

* **4/4/13** - I have to make a decision on renewing my lease by the end of the month and repairs for leak still haven't started. I email Alice again asking for an update. Alice forwards my email to ""Eve"", ""The roofer is special ordering a very unique product that will be applied to the center walls above your apartment and another for the lower part of the side wall."" And, ""The only other option, because you are living in a very old building with old, and porous brick walls, is to sheath the entire exterior wall area with black rubber roofing material.  There is no cost difference but I hate to cover my building with black rubber.  It would be an eyesore from the new park area in the back and my goal is to help downtown Greensboro, not make it look bad."" Note that my apartment is on the back side of my building, saying that I'm happy they are looking into it carefully.

* **4/19/13** - In the nearly three months since the first major leak, equal in the amount of water to the first leak. Repairs have not started yet. I email Alice and Eve alerting them to the situation.

* **4/21/13** - Eve replies to my email from 4/19, saying, ""Looks like we had a major miscommunication --- mostly my fault as you can see from these emails"". From the email chain, she never followed up with the roofer, who was waiting on her approval to get started.

* **4/24/13** - Repairs still have not started. I have to give my 60-day notice by the end of April. I signed a lease for a new apartment and sent my notice to Alice.

* **5/8/13** - Another major ceiling leak during a storm. I email Alice and Eve. Both confirm that the roofer spent two days working on my roof that week. I was never told he would be there or that he had been there.

* **5/18/13** - Alice emails saying we are expecting a lot of rain over the coming weekend and that the roofer would like to come by during the rain to find the cause. 

* **5/19/13** - Sunday morning, get no response, so I email her. She emails the roofer asking him to come by. 6 pm, without notice, the roofer knocks on the door as I'm about to head out. He spends about five minutes taking measurements and reiterates that the walls need to be sealed, just as he told me in February. After he leaves I email Alice and tell her what the roofer told me.

* **5/20/13** - I leave work at 2 pm during a heavy storm. I get home to find that water has been pouring from my ceiling. I email Eve and Alice

* **5/21/13** - I didn't receive a response to the previous day's email. I try calling Alice but she doesn't answer. I send an other email and get no response. I call Eve. She tells me she needed time to ""cool down"" and was obviously upset that my email said the company had been negligent in assuring the habitability of my apartment. After much discussion she agrees to let me end my lease early (and upon my insistence,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,t3_1es45u

I said what? no im asking about the hz and he again said did you measure the TV from corner to corner.... Hz is not the god damn measurement..

Moving on they said since dell is just a VENDOR of samsung i had to call them because in dells papers it still says the tv is 240hz. Fast foward to me asking samsung and them having absolutely NO idea what they are talking about either this ends up being the chat log.

Hello everyone

I'm a university student in Minnesota, and a little cultural extension for about two weeks, all for around $5500 dollars. There was a requirement that one pay for half of the trip on or before March 25th, and the second half on or before April 25th. I paid in full on March 25th.

The person that I spoke to, worked with me to pay with my bank card. We had some troubles, but T claimed that he worked with citibank previously, and helped me out. After this was all done, I asked if I was to now wait for travel information (I assumed this price included airfare and that I would be mailed tickets and further instructions). T told me that this was correct.

Fast forward to April 25th. I waited because I figured it would take time for things to mail, as the trip was scheduled to begin on June 2nd. I called the ISLP group, and spoke to a person named Jamal who told me that I had to go to their website, and put in a password that I hadn't been given before.

I went to this website, what sort of cultural differences there were, and the like. It also told me of the fact that no refunds were given due to cancellation past April 1st, and also that I would have to arrange my own flight to Australia, and gave the information for the travel agency they were booking through.

I contacted this agency, and then told me that to book the flights would be about $2294, including fees and taxes. Informed me that I had until monday to book these flights, and that I would need a visa. This email came to me at ten minutes to six on friday. I emailed back immediately, and on Saturday, and then twice today (the Monday that is the time limit) and never got a response.

2.	Failure to I.D.

I was not urinating in public. How could I be arrested for this?
I had multiple forms of identification on me

I was given the option to go to trial and fight it, I said I would do the diversion program.  However, I want so badly to fight this and I think I still can if I so choose.

I believe that I was held overnight because of Arizona’s SB 1070 law and to verify my immigration status

On my arrest paperwork, how could he possibly see me peeing behind a dumpster from 30ft away (which I actually was never even doing)?  

Or could it be that he wrote that I was white on the paperwork because I was arrested for “violating” SB 1070 and the police department wants their officers to record that Mexicans that are being arrested are white so that it doesn’t look like they are only arresting Mexicans that “violate” the law?

I have no idea if mis-recording my race and ethnicity really matters at all, so I would love to know what some of you think about this.

Regardless
1.	Should I fight this?
2.	Is it worth it?

Any advice helps.

TL;DR I was arrested for peeing in public and not providing an I.D. when asked.  I didn’t pee in public and the officer took and examined multiple forms of identification from my wallet after arresting me.  I was held in jail overnight.  Want to know if I should fight these charges.  Also

1359384385.0,17fhkt,I suspect something is terribly wrong with my children. Husband has custody. I have an appointment with a lawyer this afternoon. I just need some kind of reassurance before then.  Colorado/Missouri,legaladviceme,20,5,16,"Apologies for the long title and the throwaway. I wasn't sure of how to title this

Summary Backstory: I divorced my husband 6 years ago. He got physical and legal custody for a time because I was institutionalized for depression after a sexual assault.We had a change in the custody agreement a few years ago, and am expecting our first child. I still go to therapy and a rape recovery group. 

My ex and I had a brutal divorce. He blamed me for being alone and getting raped

Today: I pay him child support ( or my household does), and that Missouri is their home, not Colorado.

My ex joined a church a year ago.The girls live within some sort of compound that I am not allowed to go inside because "" I committed adultery, but an actual biblical whore. She repeatedly told me that I would burn for what I did to my family, and that the baby growing inside me was an "" abomination towards god."" I asked her who told her that. She said her preacher did. I immediately called her father. He said that the church was only teaching her what the truth about the world was, and it was his decision what they learned on his time. A few days later I entered the room to tell her that it was time to go to bed, she immediately started throwing objects at my belly ( I am very pregnant). When I asked her why because she could hurt the baby, she said god wanted the baby to die. 

She also refuses to eat at all on Sunday because the church says they can not eat at all on Sunday. I asked her if she does this routinely and she said she never eats on Sunday. Called her father he denied it. I don't know what to believe but that kid refuses to eat at all on all the Sundays she was with me. 

With my older child, and all she was able to get her to say was that she "" liked it."" My friend wants to continue with the therapy, but her dad is refusing by saying that it is probably just a phase and that therapy won't help her.

Honestly, but I know these girls and they weren't like this before. They use to be happy and now they just seem off. I know my ex thinks I am just trying to ruin his life again. I told him about everything and how we should work together to help them, but he thinks that, like everything, I am just making all this up or a bigger deal than it should be. 

I am very pregnant ( 9 months)

**tl;dr** My ex has custody of my children. I get them on some holidays and summers. They are acting very strange all of sudden. Could be abuse. I will do something. Where do I start? I am a several states away. 

Questions: How do I even start to investigate this further? Do I just tell my lawyer the whole story and let her handle it? Do I need to do anything further? For all I know, but again, I am not a professional. Can I force him to have them see a professional for help?         

This sounds messy so I totally understand if the only advice you give me is to talk to my lawyer. Or if you have no advice at all. That is okay. Feel free to ask questions for clarity. 

Thanks so much! I really

today he went to the police and they told him that they don't believe it's a criminal matter because the title to the van is in his name- how does that render the fact that his mother stole his information and took out a loan without a consent invalid? how is it not identity theft that she TOOK his SSN and information and got a loan without any permission from him?

I wanted both to let people know how the case was progressing

I submitted a tip through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

He seems to be confident that he could get a search warrant for my father's house based on the evidence already available

He seemed very understanding about that

His description of the affidavit:

&gt;In terms of the affidavit – this is the court  document that I swear to which supports the issuance of the search warrant. When I complete the affidavit, since there is a state employee involved I typically take it to another county. I normally use New Castle County, since it lessens the chance that the person is known. After the judge reviews the affidavit, he/she signs it and gives me a the signed original. A copy is placed in a sealed file until such time that the warrant is executed. When the warrant is executed, I leave a copy of the warrant and the application at the residence or with the responsible party. I do not leave my affidavit. After the warrant is served, I do a “return” to the court. This is a comprehensive list of all evidence that is seized in the warrant. The return is a document that is then mated up with the warrant and placed back in a file. If an arrest is made, the defense attorney gets a copy of the search warrant in the discovery process. This is the part of the process wherein the defense is able to see the evidence that is to be used against them in court. Typically, but the affidavit will be shared with the defendant

I guess my main question at this point, and various other things that would be extremely traumatic and drawn out.  These are the things that she specifically has wanted to avoid.

It may be that it isn't possible to avoid these things in the long run

Detailed:


In January of this year, her daddy whose kids are all grown, some with kids of their own.  Great!  Responsible adults!  They were chill with me, I was chill with them, and to show good faith, reliability, and responsibility, paper towels, grapes


But one fateful day, complete with paranoid stories about how ""all the bus drivers are out to get me"".


After he barged into my room while I was asleep to help himself to some of my weed (while my roommate was gone), extra water filters, microwave, and non-perishables and moved everything into my room, so as to sacrifice as little of my comfort to an unwanted visitor as possible.


One night (while my roommate was gone) I had my friend-with-benefits over for a late night visit and the dude pounded on my door begging for ""just a little pinch of weed for my pipey.""  (He actually said that, and closed the door in his face, he stomped angrily away and swore like a fuckity-fuck-fuck-fucking goddamned pirate back to his floor mattress.


A couple of days later (while my roommate was gone -- are you seeing a pattern yet?), I called my friend-with-benefits to tell her to come pick me up, and I was still on the phone when I heard a timid knock at my door.  I answered it to find a very strong-looking policewoman asking me to step out of my room and put my hands behind my back.  ""Am I under arrest?"" I asked, and they replied that no, it was for everyone's safety -- the fucking dude had the audacity to say ""throwawaymyroomie was making the noise!  I had to leave because he was acting all crazy, maaaan!""  See, he was trying to get me taken away on a mandatory 72-hour psychiatric hold so he could go into my room and wreak whatever havoc he desired.  So with two peoples' words against each other whose names aren't even on the lease (fuck me, the cops had no choice but to shake their fingers at us and say ""down boys down"".


Easier said than done.  I went out and bought a webcam and started recording 24/7.  Earlier today I woke up to him [throwing this tantrum](http://vocaroo.com/i/s10Rh7uZaDZn) (while my roommate was gone) -- link to sound file because I don't know how to blur faces in PowerDirector.  You could hear me peek outside my bedroom door to see what all the commotion was and closing it quietly when I saw him storm down the hallway.  After he left, I told him what had happened, played him the video, and reiterated that I had nothing to do with the issue that set him off.  His response?  ""You pay rent, and so does he, and he's not going anywhere, so if you don't like it

I don't feel safe leaving my room unless it's straight to the front door to go to work.

  So I was at work, they made her exit the apartment and would not allow her to re enter. She was half-naked, and my daughter without shoes. they were not allowed to even re-enter my home to get dressed. at this point my wife is absolutely hysterical, crying and begging for me to get there, saying that the cops needed me to come there and grant them permission to search the house (even though they had already entered the first time without permission to remove my girlfriend and my child from the residence)


 At this point, car keys, proper clothing, etc )but i know that i cannot go there freaking out or i will be arrested and then they'll be able to search my house regardless.


 My wife tells me they knocked and she looked out the peephole, the only neighbor that i dont get along with wasnt even at home so she couldnt have called them) and asked her for permission the enter the house, she said no because she isnt techinally a resident as her name is on the lease and they would have to ask me, at this point they immediately step inside the house and remove my wife and daughter, and search for ""anyone else in the house for their own protection"". Yeah. Right. Like my 3 year old and my pregant wife could be harboring some dangerous fugitives in there.

 So i leave work to come home, whatever i live here im going to go inside my house and tell my wife and child they can to. Not the case. two police officers stood in front of my wide open door, shoulder to shoulder with their arms crossed, saying they will not allow me to enter my house. So i naturally feel like im being taking advantage of, and all around straight bullied by the police officers. My wife and daughter are outside half naked and without shoes, and i have police officers telling me i cant go in my own house, nor can they to get properly dressed.

 By now i've had more than enough of the police harassing my family, blocking the entrance. I obviously cant enter through the front door, i would have to move the cops, which is what im sure they wanted me to do. add on a nice assault on an officer charge to. I brainstorm a little bit and realize my back window is unlocked. im not being detained, im allowed to leave, i have my keys.. so i do... only to park my car a distance aways so i can climb into my house via the back window. everyone wins, i get in my house, and now they cant enter without their warrent.


 Well the cops start to wonder 'where im at"" so the officer comes into my house
In my house. Which again, but the way these cops were acting i expected a door to be kicked down and me to be beaten, so i hesitated to shut it.


 At this point ive been there for about an hour already, im going to go get a felony search warrant and tear your house down until i find it."" this was before i was arrested, and my lawyer told me to enter the house.


 Back to the story, it was approved and they break out the dog. They run the dog through my house, they find nothing. The first cop is fucking PISSED now, because he thinks i flushed my weed down the toilet. Which i didnt, i didnt have enough time to before the other cop entered to arrest me. So he threatens to charge me with felony destruction of evidence or something of the sort. Im actually quite hysterical at this point, as to how their ""drug dog"" couldnt find my half ounce of high grade weed that was literally 5 feet away from the front door. I could have sniffed it out myself if i didnt even know where it was.

 Anyways, i even told them i would show them where its at if they would stop destroying my house. i was told to be quiet theyll find it on their own. 

 So it takes them about an hour to find my jar of weed, i get charged with three things

*Possession of a controlled substance

*Possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute

and the final one

*Felony interference with Police duties


Before everyone tells me to get a lawyer, but pricey. Im confident we will get this taken care of, I just want to know what everyone thinks, and is what the police officers did legal?


Also, but it says im not allowed to possess, or be under the influence of alcohol or drugs and that I can be subject to ""random drug screenings"".. well i dont have a PO and I dont have to see the judge again until 9/11/13, so im a little confused as to what this means also? is it basically a ""dont fuck up again with drugs or alcohol or we will can your ass so hard"" or are they actually gonna send random cops to find me and make me pee for them? I think ill probably just get a UA in september when i go in to court, but id really like to know what you guys think it is.


I meet with my attorney again tomorrow morning to go over anything.

Two nights ago, my husband was holding the leash and in the middle, and I was on the street side. Immediately after passing us, he turned sharply behind me (close enough that I could feel his body heat), and stomped at the dog, who ignored him as he urinated. I was startled, and my initial reaction was to dodge him.

Last night, and that he had just lost him. 

I got in the car (I picked the one that is a style common in our neighborhood) and drove to him, golf club slung over his shoulder. Both these streets are on a hill, and you can see 5-6 blocks up on both sides. (To clarify what I mean by patrolling: he was south of where my husband had left him, and heading back north, which meant he had doubled back towards the initial encounter, then turned around again).  The area he chose made it clear that he is somewhat familiar with our patterns. We think he might live in our neighborhood, but not close to us.

I called him into the police for walking around with a weapon and his behavior. 

After I called this incident in, which made it clear he was following my husband. He also said that, when he first ran into him, he had asked about me in a mildly sexist/disparaging way (ETA: it was an inappropriately personal question).

So, or my husband. (The dog is large, and we both have been fixated on/stalked by random crazies in the past.) We're planning to drive to a dog park for the evening walks for a while for safety, but this is not feasible in the morning, and he may start looking for us then if he realizes we are avoiding him.

The police never followed up on the call I put in, and they had cause for an arrest without following up with me. How do I find this out? (ETA: he was not on the blotter).

We also plan on documenting every encounter with this man. What is the best way to do this? When is it appropriate to pursue a restraining order? Also

I'm going to talk to a state trooper I know when I get the chance

I spoke to a friends lawyer up in Boston who said it would cost $10, it'll take a month (project might be done by then), and the chance of getting them to stop construction is very low considering we would have to prove irreparable harm.

When I was leaving the store the other night, me and another employee (we'll cal her Lisa) clocked out, at 8pm, and locked the doors. When I came in the next day, I noticed that labor was at 33% for the night before. Seeing as there were no more sales, labor could not possibly go down. After som investigation, I saw that Lisa's time clock had been altered on the computer and that her clock out time was now 5:30pm. I had witnessed her clock out at 8pm. The only people who have access to the system on the computer are the general manager, and myself. I immediately talked to the other shift leader and asked for his advice.

The next day, as some employees were cheated out of as many as 20 hours in one pay period. However, I need to carefully plan my course of action before I do anything. A responsible store owner would have called the Department of Labor, just to cover his own ass, but I do not think that he has. I also do not see him firing the GM. If something does not happen soon (at the very least, employees receiving checks for lost hours) I would like to take matters into my own hands in a responsible manner.

Additional note: every employee gets a time clock print out when clocking out. It includes hours worked that day, I have access to the system, so I am able to print off any type of report and keep it in my records.

I'm in a weird situation at the moment

My little sister is a mess as a result of stuff my father did to her when she was little. He told her always that we were terrible, he bought her bikini underwear because he liked how it looked, he used to go around outside the house with a mask on and rattle on the windows to scare her and then come in her room and ""save the day"". He's really fucked up and I stopped seeing him as soon as I could (before most of this was happening). 

Anyway

She went off the deepend and told school that I've been raping her and had in the past. School didn't really do anything about it other than talk to my mom. 

A few days ago she started going to counseling again and told the councilor that she's been hurting herself

My mom and the councilor agreed with my sister that she go to the psych ward to stay inpatient. 


She's there now, and that my mother is to blame for enabling all of it. 

I really want to know what to expect in the next few weeks. I'd like to know if there's anything I should do

If I should expect a call from CPS asking me questions

I'm aware that this is not a place for actual legal advice but I'm really hoping anyone could give me help as to what I should be expecting and preparing myself for in the next few weeks. Thanks in advance. =\

(I had been running for over 2 miles non-stop, not going to quit now) For some reason the officer got out to pursue me on foot calling for me to stop about 3 or 4 times, to which i continued calling ""I haven't done anything wrong"" and ""I haven't broken any laws"", after about 20 yds or so I stopped. He caught up, grabbed me and put me in handcuffs

1348136013.0,106p1h,I was overpaid by my employer for 6 months. They realized their error and are now determined to ruin me financially. I live and work in Alabama.,SKINTtoe,16,5,46,"I have worked for this company for the last 4 1/2 years. It is a very large company with product brands known world wide. I have been in the union since I started working here.  
Last March I transferred to a different department of this company. Same company
 When I submitted my transfer request last March I went 100% by all of the rules and guidelines that are required for any job transfer within the company.  
I will leave out a lot of details to keep this question as short as possible. I will be happy to provide any information
Last Wednesday  I received an email from our HR department stating that they have been overpaying me $6.00/hr since last March. The grand total was around $11
 Next I received another email stating that effective immediately I would start earning $6.00/hr less than I have been currently earning and my next paycheck would start the repayment process and the repayment process is set at $1
So all within a few hours I found out that my pay has been cut by $6.00 and they are deducting $1
The next day in our meeting my union representative was completely useless. My rep. asked the HR leader if we could lower the amount per paycheck because I needed money to live on and support my family. The HR leader simply said ""no"" and my union rep. basically just looked at me and said he was sorry but there is nothing he can do about it.  
  
Right now here is the situation.  
I will have $1,000.00. He said he is only going back to June for repayment instead of March. That may seem nice of him until one little thing is considered. That one little thing is that he has admitted to me that this whole ordeal is entirely his fault.  
The transfer guidelines I referred to earlier was written by him personally. The guidelines state that I was entitled to the $6.00/hr that he now claims I was overpaid. He says now that the guidelines have been changed last Monday because they were wrong.
So right now I am so screwed beyond anything I have ever expected. I have to pay back $5
I'm willing to take any advice anyone has to put a stop to these payments. I don't have a union to go to and my first paycheck with the first payment is only 1 more day away.  
If I have to pay the $1, groceries etc.. 
This is crazy. Any help or advice is very much appreciated.  
Thanks  
  
  
Edit  
Thanks everyone for some really good suggestions!  
In my first post I said I would answer any questions and/or provide any details that was needed to help. If I miss your question here then I'm sure I will get it for sure in the comments section.  
For the past 6 months I was earning $24.00/hr. As of last week (Wednesday) my pay dropped to $18.00/hr. The way my schedule works I get paid for 84 hours every 2 weeks. I'll just say my pay should be $1
So when they deduct the $1
 I have been working some overtime for the past week so hopefully we will be able to survive. By the way
I do have documentation stating that I should be receiving $24.00/hr when I started my new role back in March. The documentation is titled ""Revised Transfer Process"". It is an email that was sent out by the head man over our entire Human Resources department. (I'll call him Mr. L) This email was sent out last year to every person that works for our company. Depending where you transfer from and where you transfer to is what decides your pay rate. According to his email someone that transfers from my previous role to my current role will transfer in at ""level 1"" pay rate. The ""level 1"" pay rate is $24.00/hr.  
When I transferred last March to my new role I started earning $24.00/hr just like the email stated. I never thought my pay should be lower or higher. My pay was correct according to Mr. L's email. I was not hiding, sneaking or lying. Now Mr. L is telling me that the email was wrong. He claims that someone transferring from my previous role to my current role should start off at ""base pay"". Not ""level 1"" pay. Since I showed him the ""Revised Transfer Process"" email he sent out he immediately went and changed it to read what he now claims. So now according to the ""Revised Transfer Process"" my job title/role is to be paid $18.00/hr. 
I have several copies of this email saved in several different places. I have met with Mr. L. on three occasions in the past few days to discuss this situation. I told him several times that I will basically have no paycheck after the repayment. I asked (almost begged... okay I begged) him to reduce the $1
Tomorrow (Friday) I am taking the advice I've seen on here. I have no other choice other than to call an attorney. I just know that Mr. L. is usually very sharp and knowledgeable about the laws. It's hard for me to believe he would set himself up for me to take him on with the email I have from him and by taking so much money from me. Shit

1330362226.0,q8a8t,What to do if you're pulled over for speeding or some other traffic violation (or how to get a warning),an_actual_lawyer,14,2,17,"The [Kansas Highway Patrol](http://www.kansashighwaypatrol.org/) offers the following tips for drivers when they encounter an emergency vehicle or are stopped for a traffic infraction. My comments are also included below as well below each of the KHP's tips.  Every State/city/jurisdiction will be different

If anyone has any thoughts or advice

Lets say that you're driving along and a traffic patrol officer uses radar or laser (""LIDAR"") to determine that you're speeding. What do you do next?

**• Do not panic. Use your turn signal
Attorney comment: Our Kansas City metro area traffic law firm's lawyers recommend pulling over normally and smoothly, or whatever the violation is. The key to pulling over properly is to not do anything that might result in an additional ticket or suspicion.  If you pull over too quickly, then you might receive a ticket for that (often failure to signal or failure to yield).  If you pull over too slowly, you may aggravate the police officer who is attempting to stop you. In either case, it could be used as ""an indicator of intoxication"" that the police officer uses to justify a DUI investigation or arrest, a common occurrence in many cities and states, especially at night.  The officer might also think that you're pulling over slowly in order to hide drugs, etc.  Either way

If you can, Shawnee, Merriam, etc. are trained to position their cars in a diagonal position to deflect another vehicle, but in the back of their mind, they still wonder about the traffic. Pulling over far enough will help ease the traffic officer's mind, which is what you want when you're trying to get a warning instead of a moving violation.

**• If you are being pulled over
Attorney comment: This is also good advice. Our law firm's [Mission traffic lawyers](http://www.missiontrafficlawyers) also recommend that you take the keys out of the ignition and place them on the dash. This lets the police officer know that you aren't about to drive off and begins to build a little bit of trust which may be useful if you are later asking to avoid a ticket.

**• Keep your hands in plain view
Attorney comment: The driver should keep their hands on the wheel

**• Ask any passengers in your vehicle to remain calm and comply with the officer's instructions. Instruct them to keep their hands in plain view and not make any sudden movements.
• Wait for the officer to park the patrol car and approach. He or she may ask for your driver's license, politely ask the officer.**
Attorney comment: If the officer asks if you know why he pulled you over, so do not take the bait. Just respond politely and calmly, do not do anything that might escalate the situation. Traffic patrol officers in Johnson County, Kansas, such as Overland Park, Merriam, and elsewhere are trained to use this tactic to look for evidence of other traffic infractions or driving under the influence.

**• If it is dark
**Attorney comment: If you are being investigated for drunk driving

**• Stay in your vehicle unless the officer asks you to get out. Most of the time, keep your hands in plain view and watch for traffic.**
Attorney comment: If a police officer in Johnson County asks you to exit your car, be polite and calm, there is no need to escalate the situation.

**• If you receive a traffic citation, not the side of the road.**
Attorney comment: ***This is very good advice.*** Just respond to questions or a citation politely and calmly
For example

For instance, then the Overland Park prosecutor may not allow our firm's attorneys to amend the speeding, red light, following too closely or other traffic ticket to a non-moving violation. This is also true for [Prairie Village speeding/traffic ticket amendments,](http://www.prairievillageticketlawyer.com) and other cities in Johnson County, KS.

My ex, type HSV-1. When we met, she lied and told me she was clean -- she didn't want to use condoms. After months together, I eventually caught her in the lie, confronted her, she lied some more (she says she told me, but never did)

I stayed with her anyway because, she's emotionally abusive, and she knows how to manipulate me. She tried to convince me I already had herpes; she tried to convince me there was no way I could contract it from her. She still took no precautions: no condoms, no suppressive medication therapy.

Fast forward a couple of months from that time to this July. I contracted HSV-1. She lied

Plot twist: she was fucking another guy behind my back who is now her roommate. I just found out that not only were they sleeping together, but he hasn't told her he's sleeping with my ex/his roommate, or that she is the one he got it from.).

Here's what her roommate told me:
&gt;She did give me herpes....and she did tell me the same lies about how she had never had a herpes outbreak before and that she thought it could not be transmitted to anyone

I've seen the texts between them: everything she said to him -- the denials, except that she told him she never had herpes, and he never caught her in that lie.

I've even seen texts from my ex to her best friend that says she's glad her roommate's girlfriend got herpes from her -- she's extremely jealous of her.

Is there any legal recourse to this? I have to imagine she's going around telling everyone she sleeps with -- it's a laundry list; she's a man-a-week type of woman -- she's clean and barebacking them all. She's got to stop doing this. Is this some sort of reckless endangerment

**Edit for clarity:** I found out she had herpes about 2 months before I had an outbreak, that she'd been with her husband for 7 years and never given it to him, etc. She even said she'd never had another outbreak, although AFTER I got it she told me this was her third outbreak. I don't honestly know what's the real truth on that end. Her roommate, on the other hand, claims she said she was clean. I've seen texts between them where she says things like
&gt;""could just be your skin reacting to new flora. Fortunately for you

later on:
&gt; Man I feel like shit. I really had no idea. I cannot even tell you how sorry I am.

^These messages are from 2 days after she sent me a message complaining that her herpes had flared up.

Tonight I found out that our owner has been incorrectly adding up extra minutes on the time cards resulting in short paychecks. What she does is enter extra minutes in a shift over a whole hour into the calculator as decimals instead of counting them separately and dividing by 60. So what happens is extra minutes over whole hours on a shift are treated as if an hour was 100 minutes.

For example a 6 hour 15 minute shift would be counted as 6.15 on the calculator instead of the 6.25 it should be.

1374961786.0,1j6krd,West Virginia Roommate Advice,Meddikal,18,5,7,"About 4 month ago I started talking to a wonderful guy who lives in California by complete chance. I was living with my two roommates in West Virginia. I would always pay months in advance for rent and bills because I work as an engineer contracted by the government so

My roommates started outwardly dating about 7 months ago, while still dating my other roommate. That same day I actually started looking around for a new place in the area. I worked from home with most of my contracts so I let the girl roommate use my car most of the time.

The relationship with the guy I had met in California got a little more serious and we wanted to make plans to meet. I decided to go see him and stay for a few weeks to see how things went.  Just a few days before I was suppose to leave, the car was completely wrecked. After a little time passed, none of them offered to do anything about it so I prepared court papers just in case.

I still decided to go on my trip and see my boyfriend. While I was cross country my roommates texted and said they wanted to give me a 30 days notice when I got back which was a reasonable amount of time. I did a few interviews out in California and lined up a nice job for when I moved. They also said they wanted to give me a down payment for a car when I came back home to West Virginia.

While I was out visiting, something of that nature. I ended up staying cross country for almost a month and enjoyed every minute. I kept in touch with my roommates back home here and there to see how things were going. I also let them know when I would be home since they would have to use a work car to come and get me. 

Finally got back home around midnight EST after traveling for 15 hours. My roommate gave me this little box wrapped in a cute bow and told me to open it. I did and it was empty. I gave her a confused look she says ""You actually thought I would give you something?"" Then

So it's 2 am, and just started my new job,  I ended up being lied to and baited to come home just so they could feel some sort of revenge and malice. I ask them about my rent and security deposit since I paid thousands in advance and they mentioned they would try to pull some money out the next morning.  I told them that's fine and I'll have to stay here tonight and get in touch with someone to find a place to stay til I can get things in order to move. 

The next morning I woke up and packed up most of my things. I went to stay with a family member so that my roommates had time to get me back the money they had owed me for rent so

I am currently on my family member's couch trying to keep my receipts and documents up to date for my court papers. I have a family friend who is an attorney for the area and he agreed to take the case for me so I could continue with my plans of moving

The next day my roommates ended up getting in touch with me and told me that they felt they owed me nothing and I was only allowed to stop by to get my things with their permission. A few days passed and they kept rescheduling. I ended up having to call the police to escort possibly get an escort to remove my items.

So with all their scheming , and apartment waiting for me across country but was lied to and maliciously baited into an agreement to come home and be kicked out for their own personal reasons.

A bit of text
My wife and I got let go from our jobs on the same day about 4 months ago while living in MN(same company). Her mother, which is besides the point I suppose but last night my wife and her mother had a pretty large argument(because the bathroom that is attached to our bedroom is ""absolutely fithly and disgusting""). Here are 2 images of said bathroom as she saw it yesterday, taken this morning. http://imgur.com/s7XIUWd,N3CWwJL#0

 This argument ended with her mother hitting her daughter in the chest (a punch above the breast) and telling us that we had to move out. Her (at the time drunk) step-dad comes in and gets in my face

 To my main point and question/s we have. He believes that he can bring all of our belongings onto the street because it is 'his house' and that he does not need to give us any notice. I am not 100% sure but I know when we have lived in apartments and town homes there is a notice that needs to be given, we have no lease agreement, we do not pay rent as they offered for us to stay here for free while we look for work and can move out(and we are currently living on our unemployment benefits). My wife just turned 40 and I am 32. So if they can do this it means we are homeless and will have to sell most of what we have to get back to MN. From my meager knowings of some laws, don't they still have to get a notarized document telling us to vacate the premise within 30 days? I am not their child that just turned 18 and they want out of the house, I am an adult that picked up and left everything I know for something I thought was right at the time. What rights to we have in this situation? We will be moving back to MN as there is no way I will tolerate such behavior from 'adults', it's that we cannot move all of our belongings in a day. We would prefer to move today all of my family is in MN and her extended family live 5+hours away and is not really an option that we wish to pursue. Sorry to turn this into a partial spewing of context. 

TLDR: 'Adult children' being told to leave immediately from a house we were invited to. Is that legal or does a notice need to be given.


UPDATE:

We are going to legal aid tomorrow morning to see what our options are. This morning they came into our room, I guess you should have been a lawyer(huh?), if you guys are here when we get back I am calling the sheriff"". I responded with 'you can do what you feel is right, but you legally cannot make us vacate because you 'say so', we have done nothing wrong. We will be leaving as soon as we can, however you cannot force us to leave as we have not broken any law.""
This only angered him more, falling backwards into the tub. I got up each time, he kept pushing me back into the bathroom. When my wife ran in he then grabbed her arm and yelled in her face. 
We immediately left when we could(he kept walking in front of the door

He's currently in the hospital due to complications from his chemotherapy; Pneumonia, and they've reversed the CHF and KF, and are actively working on the pneumonia.  He's currently on a mask to help him breathe, not a breathing machine.

Him and his wife married a few years ago.  She's stubborn, once she told me about how her previous husband died of cancer, and how she collected a large life insurance payout.  Everything in her story was suspicious at the time; even more so now.

He requested to remain on the mask.  What bothers me is she apparently flew off the handle with the nurse, told the nurse that he doesn't want to be on the mask anymore.  His daughter talked to him after and asked why he no longer wanted to be on the mask when just 15 minutes prior, he did.  He said that wasn't the case.  The step-daughter who's a nurse in Phoenix, has been trying to run the show at the hospital.  She's already been kicked out once or twice, but not flat-out banned.

The nurse and doctor both jumped into action to get the wife and step-daughter immediately banned, and then started talking about his life insurance policy.

I'm obviously very concerned, since he's currently 100% of sound mind according to the doctor, he can file divorce or something to block her from killing him.

No one has ever liked his wife, because he doesn't really trust her.  I'm trying to get to Arizona as soon as possible, and I'm wanting to talk to him privately, and get something in writing, or on recorded audio/video, expressing his concern, and his wishes.

I'm going to hit the road shortly.  Thank you everyone for the advice.  I'll check back in when I get to Arizona, thank you.


**Update: 2013-07-22 1935 PST**

I decided to get as much sleep as possible before hitting the road to ensure my eight-hour drive was a safe one, and read him the card I had sent in the mail a couple days prior.  The card read: ""Barbados, and rum drinks on the beach!  See you soon!""  (I have an accompanying gift: a sealed container with beach sand, and three rum shot bottles partially buried.)

From the time I hit the road throughout the weekend, telling me that his wife told him to come to the hospital and say his goodbyes.  I obviously became upset, and called his son, who then called the doctor, and was told that he was relatively stable, and that he was not on his way out.  That particular incident was enough that the nurses and doctors were instructed to no longer listen to her whatsoever, and they because discussing with him about lifting the DNR and DNI.

I stayed at the hospital over night, so I turned on my camera in my vehicle, to record the entire exchange.  With what I heard come out of her mouth, it took every last ounce of strength to not knock her out, and run her over.  She just kept talking about how he keeps taking three steps back, and isn't going to get better, and there's no reason for him to fight to live.  Instead, and his entire family is here to support him through it all.  I promised him that when I spoke with him the night before.

I had to leave at that point

Last night around 12:20am, and immediately fell asleep.  3:30am I received a call from his son.  He became unresponsive at 12:20am, and they were doing everything in their legal power to keep him alive until my brother-in-law and I got there.

It took me 20 minutes.  (Thank you Sheriffs Department for not pulling me over when I blasted by three of you with my flashers on, and you relaying it to all officers.)  When I arrived, his family and I walked in.  We all said our goodbyes.  Everyone left when they went to take his CPAP off, except his wife, myself, and my brother-in-law.  The doctor and nurses warned us that it would probably take 2-3 hours for him to finally pass, and that it wouldn't be pretty.

I am in dire need of advice. My boyfriend and I were served late last night with a petition to appear in court next Wednesday over eviction from our apartment. Our rent was owed on July 1 but we stopped paying because we need to save to get out of here and find a new place. Our landlord strongly believes we have no ground to stand on in court but we think otherwise.

This is VERY long. Just a warning.

-We signed a lease in mid-April and moved in about a week later. The ad for the apartment stated $1350/month, our landlord changed it to $1500 saying we would have to pay $150 for our share of the oil. (We live in the basement and tenants on the first floor pay the other half). We were supposed to pay only 40% and upstairs 60% but we found out later on that upstairs actually pays $150 too even though they have more square footage and 4 more people living up there.

-The week we moved in

-He finally showed us his ""permit"" for the basement apartment but it didn't specify that it was for the basement. It only said the house's address. This had us worried coupled with the things our guests were telling us about the place being illegal. There are only windows in the living room/kitchen but none in the 2 bedrooms. And the windows we do have aren't big enough/up to code. They also said there's no way it can be legal with a door to the sump pump being in our living room, and nothing covering the bottom of the door to the boiler room. When we confronted our landlord about these issues, he said he has a ""permit for a habitable space"" but no permit for the kitchen. And he said all he would have to do was make one window bigger for the apartment to be legal. However, he said the work he needs to do costs too much money at the moment. Despite him admitting to us that he can't legally rent the apartment, he says the judge won't care about that, only our rent due. 

-One night about a month ago, I really don't know anything about boilers). He also found out that there was no wiring going to the basement for heat, only to upstairs. And that basically our thermostat was fake, like a decoy. Also, the door to the boiler room is my boyfriend's 2-year-old son's room and the guy said the boiler had been spewing soot at the door and the wall to his room as long as we'd been living there. He showed us the black all over the wall and door as proof. As a pregnant woman (5 months along), these issues frightened me to my core. He finally finished the job at 1 a.m., at the upstairs tenants' expense. Our landlord said the boiler problems must have been a result of a previous tenant messing with it. He also came to the apartment to prove our heat worked. However

-Another major issue is the washer and drier in the laundry room directly outside our door to the apartment. First of all, turning our apartment into an issue of National Geographic. Second the hose is made up various types of hoses, including a radiator hose from a car, and shoddily put together, causing frequent flooding. The water floods the laundry room and then gets under the door to our apartment and into my boyfriend's son's room. This has happened so many times already that it completely ruined his carpet and we had to throw it out. While our landlord offered to replace the carpet, he didn't offer to fix the issue. What's the point in replacing the carpet if it's just going to get damaged again?

-A minor issue in the scope of things but a big issue for me: one day our landlord thought no one was home (but I was and i was in the shower) and he tried opening the door to our apartment without knocking but the latch was on

I have a unique roommate situation and I was wondering if I can get any guidance on what to do.  I sublet a place from a guy who basically had this place as a bachelor pad when he was separating from his wife.  He decided he was too rich to divorce his wife so he subleted the place to me for half the rent.  He is allowed to come at any time and his ""bedroom"" is the couch.  Thus far he only has slept over once.

He is trying to kick me out for the apartment being messy and non payment.  I would love to pay him the rent but he refuses to pick it up and because his wife doesn't know about the place there is not an address I can send it too.  He claims I have till Sunday to move out or else he will throw my stuff on the curb.  I already contacted the landlord who is on the side of my roommate.

The facts of the

* I have a roommate agreement but am not on the lease.  I have lived there 4 months and have utility bills to prove my residency
* He refuses to take rent from me
* the lease is over on July 27th anyway

**What are my legal rights and what should I do?**  He is clearly trying to intimidate me.  The guys is scum bag and advertised the apartment as for ""girls only"" (he's  guy).  I'm in constant fear he is going to attack me although there is no legal claim to my worries just general interactions with this guy.  

I was thinking of e-mailing him with the statute and the fact that I called the police and they know of the situation but I don't know if that's the best legal thing to do.

Baltimore MD area.",geno7,15,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1g4h54/civil_suit_question_bought_a_new_home_and_i/

My girlfriend and I bought a house in November of last year.  The house was a remodel and everything from the first floor up is brand new.  The home was originally only one story with a basement but is now two stories.  Our home inspection went great and everything about the house was fantastic so we put in an offer and eventually moved in.  Fast forward until April/May.  
Our basement is completely finished with dry wall and carpeting.  Our basement is also protected with a sump pump.  Throughout the months of April and May I noticed dampness in the carpet after a big rain.  Initially I thought it may be condensation related but the problem continued to occur with more intensity.  Eventually I decided to rip the carpet up and found water all over the floor.  The source of this water was finally tracked to an area behind the wall.
Water was pooling behind the drywall on our knee wall that sticks out from the foundation.  I called in some waterproofers to come take a look and they told me I would need an interior system as well as a system on the knee wall to push water to the sump pump.

I called the builder about this problem and he claimed he never saw any water in the basement and never noticed any water damage.  He says he has no idea why we are having water problems and will not be assisting us in paying for this job.

So the waterproofers come over and begin work on the basement.  They find that the water has been leaking in through a few foundation cracks and when it builds up too high on the knee wall it rolls onto the floor.  Now for where it gets interesting.

The guys working in the basement discover pads that mechanics use to catch oil and grease stuffed behind the wall in the problem areas.  They also find a heavy build up of tar in this area which suggests that the builder absolutely knew of this problem but stuck the pads back there to absorb as much water as possible so he could sell the house while claiming there was never any water problems.  My neighbors have also told me that he used to come to the house during storms and surround the basement door and well with blue tarps.

My question is can I sue the guy I bought the house from because he willfully and purposely deceived me about water damage that he knew was going on in the basement?  If so what do I need to strengthen my case?  I feel the absorbent pads in the wall is the biggest sign considering there should be no reason for them to be there.

After being on the phone for 3 hours we were told that we be given call back and that everything would be fixed. Once again we never got a call. Now our service gets shut off because we haven't paid any of the bill due to them ""Fixing"" the amounts. So we call again going through the same bullshit for the third time. They say that they are sorry for the inconvenience and that they will turn our service back on while they are trying to fix our bill. This was good enough for us so we enjoyed our service while waiting for them to get back to us. 1 week later we are shut off again. So we call. They say that they have fixed the bill and just hadn't gotten back to us yet. The amount that they gave us at this point for our three months of service was about 600 and being as the lack of internet was really starting to mess with our work/school/social lives we decided to pay it. So we get our service turned back on and we go on with our lives assuming that all is well. But like clockwork one week later the service is back off. We call. They tell us we owe them somewhere in the ballpark of 600 more dollars. So we tell them to royally go fuck themselves.

My mother was cruel, far beyond the point of abuse but not enough that it was ever proven.

Having grown up a significant amount and overcoming some real development issues due to the abuse, and likely always shall, live with the mother. 

However, and it appears that we are on the verge of finally being rid of her. My younger sister rented a house and had it modified to accommodate my disabled sister (handrails, bedroom, disabled specific equipment for her) and upon her death, my younger sister would like my disabled sister to live with her, and for her to be responsible for her.

(TN),kaygeeeff,16,4,19,"I own a small house that sits very close to my neighbor's. She rents the home and was there when I moved in 4+ years ago. About 18 months ago, and about 20' from the street. It's covered in a tarp and the tires have long gone flat. The vehicle hasn't moved since it was damaged. 

About a year ago, very friendly discussion with her about both issues. She assured me they would be addressed within days- that she was starting a trash service, and that she had a buyer for the car. Nothing happened after a month, so I decided to go ahead and make the call.  Within a week of the call the garbage was gone but the car didn't move. I followed up with building and codes after another couple months, they said they would send another inspector out immediately. The car is still there, but she went and had the tags renewed since they were long expired. 

Now that warm weather is here again the car is starting to cause problems beyond unsightliness. Wasps have built nests under the hood and in the passenger compartment. Bits of tarp and masking tape have been blowing into my yard for ages. I made my third call to building and codes about six weeks ago and spoke to someone who said he was a supervisor. He assured me that the situation would be dealt with. The car has now been joined by a washer/dryer combo that appears to have been chucked off the second-floor back deck of the house. Both are still there. 

I spoke to my neighbor several times about the car. We're friendly, who seem unwilling to deal with this issue. I like to think I'm a pretty good neighbor and I don't want to start a big feud over a stupid SUV, but my house will be put on the market in the next few months and I'd love to have this thing gone sooner rather than later. 

Should I attempt to go through codes again? What's the next step in a situation like this? Any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated.

1369437649.0,1f01w5,My apartment complex authorized the tow of my vehicle even though I was legitimately parked,als365,13,1,0,"My apartment complex is re-sealing the asphalt this week.  This means that vehicles have to be off the pavement for 8 hours.  They broke it up into 5 days and did a portion of the complex each day so they wouldn't inconvenience everyone at once.  They placed flyers on all of the posts holding up the carports and at the front of every parking spot that said which day they would be doing which spots and that if you left your car in that spot for the day you would be towed.  I moved my vehicle the night before into a different spot that was not within the specified construction area for Monday.  It said that on Monday they would be working on ""all uncovered spaces for buildings E and F and all carport #'s 139-219 &amp; 233-264 (see map).""  I parked at an uncovered space two spaces past carport #264.  This space as not near building E or F - it was in front of buildings C and D.  

I came home from work on Monday and my vehicle was towed.  It cost me $270 to release it (200 for the tow and 70/day storage fee).  When I went to the apartment office and told them that I was not parked in a ""building E or F uncovered space"" or between carports 139-218 or 233-264 they handed me a color coded map.  It was a Google satellite view of the complex with colored boxes around the sections of spaces that would be worked on each day.  The space I was parked in was noted on the map but not on the flyer so there's an obvious discrepancy here.  The manager said that copies of these maps and flyers were taped to each tenant's door prior to the construction (about 10 days).  I never received anything taped to my door.  Obviously if I would have seen the map then I would have moved my vehicle further down the parking lot but according to the flyer I was parked in a good spot.  She also said that they taped maps to the construction cones placed around the parking lot.  I saw the construction cones placed in the parking lot about 2 days before construction started but I did not see any maps taped to them prior to the start of construction.  When I was walking back to my apartment unit I did see the maps taped to a few of the cones.  Management stated that they would not refund my towing charges because they stated that they provided maps and flyers to all the residents by taping them to their apartment doors and that there were maps taped to the construction cones (not all of them but a few of them).  As I previously stated I never received anything taped to my door.  There was a flyer taped to my carport but there were no maps to accompany the flyers (the office admitted that they only posted flyers to the carports - no maps).  I would assume that they did tape the information to my door and it may have blown off in the wind or something - it happens sometimes (I've come home sometimes to find a piece of tape and a small strip of paper stuck to it on my door from the wind blowing stuff off).  

So do I have a leg to stand on or am I screwed out of $270.  My argument is that according to the flyer I was parked in a legitimate spot.  The flyer however does say ""see map"" but I never received a map (although one may have been taped to my door I never received it - probably got blown off by the wind or ripped off by kids).  It never indicates where to ""see"" the map but I didn't have any reason to believe that I was in a questionable spot as the flyer clearly stated where not to park and I wasn't in any of those spots.  My other argument is whether or not taping stuff to the door of an apartment unit constitutes proper notice.  Most of the stuff taped to my door is about picking up your dog shit and stupid stuff like that (I have no pets but they tape that stuff to everyone's door to be fair).  My lease renewal was taped to the door and mailed to me.  I know that evictions are also taped and mailed.  There's an obvious discrepancy between the flyer and the map and they should have posted both on the parking spots rather than just the flyer.  If you look at the map you can see that there are 3 or 4 spaces past space 264 that are highlighted.",self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1f01w5/my_apartment_complex_authorized_the_tow_of_my/

I returned home for spring break last Thursday night to find that a substantial amount of my expensive liquor had been consumed (Dad does not drink at all), the inside of the dryer has been festooned with stickers, my bathroom was excessively filthy, and the distinct smell of marijuana was in the air. I called my father, who was not home when I arrived, and he informed me that he allowed my cousin, my cousin's wife

While I am glad that my father has that helping spirit, but I do because I am expected to do all of the cleaning and caretaking of the house. Not only did I have to invest time in order to get the trailer clean again, but I had to invest money in the form of cleaning supplies.

I told my father all of the things that they did and told him that under no circumstance would I be okay with them staying there ever again, and being that they live in a sub-par apartment complex, it's likely they'll have repair on their home again sometime in the not-too-distant future. Even though I'm not the legal owner of the home, is there anything I can legally do to make sure they can't stay in my home again? I'm graduating in May and will be home for at least six months after that while I get on my feet, but I spend a lot of weekends away and the last thing I need is to come home to this ever again.

About a week after getting into trouble with the teacher

Snow made the teacher's name signifgantly differnt from the real name--she used an exaggerated phonemic spelling and latinized it as well. She showed a couple of friends what she did. According to her
Snow believed that another student was going to be kicked off the baseball team for something he posts on the parody so she decided (without letting any of us know what was going on) to email the teacher and confess. This morning she went to the classroom to talk to the teacher and apologize. The teacher refused to speak to her. 
She was called into the office this afternoon and suspended for 2 days. Charges have been filed at the local PD (we live in Los Angeles

My questions are thus:
One
Two
Three
Can she be expelled? There is nothing in the parent/teacher handbook about identity theft (that is what they are calling it) but they do have a bullying code. 
Will being charged with a crime prevent her from receiving financial aide in college? 
The teacher has claimed she is suffering emotionally from this issue--it is making her IBS act up and she has suffered humiliation in front of students and coworkers. Can she civilly sue a student? If she does can she sue us or our father or put a lien on our home since she lives in the home and we receive Adoption Assistance from the state for her due to her special needs and health concerns (no

This incident in particular was one morning he found that he was unable to use my computer. As I had the only computer in the house. He came into my room and demanded that I let him use it. When I refused and tried to leave the room that he was blocking, at which point I called the police. 

The police came, and I said that at the beginning I had tried to walk past him. (I was trying to be honest) They said that since I started it, that I was going to be the person charged and forced me to leave the house. 

A couple weeks later, and I kept going to court claiming my innocence, that was until the day before my court case when I went to to the judge he told me that I was going to have to get my own lawyer, since my step father made too much money for a court appointed lawyer. 

At that point I was offered a plea in advance

I agreed, which I had successfully gone through the application for. Then it hit me, they did a background check and found the plea in advance. I was denied the job. I still went to school, but I required school loans now for living expenses, and I still didn't have enough to eat. Despite all this I managed to get a 3.7 gpa for my first year. 

After the year, it went from being a plea in advance to a criminal charge. I had found out that they had sent mail to my parents home and that it had been thrown away. At the same time, my glasses broke and a tooth cavity was getting so bad that I went to the dentist to get a filling, both without insurance or a job. I used all my money that should have gone towards food to cover the costs.  That's when I dropped out of school. 

My sister said that she could get me work at a call center that she worked and I moved in with her and was able to get the job. But all my money went towards rent. I had no money to pay school loans, up until I say that I do have an assault charge, then they turn me away. I'm about to be homeless soon, this event has ruined my life and I don't know what to do.

I) On the deed

II) Since purchased, etc., but his name is not on the mortgage because he was the victim of identity theft when they bought the house. Also, they share a joint bank account, so it might be difficult to prove who's money went where. 

Questions:

1) One would assume he can't force his partner to sell the house. So

2) Is it an option to get his name removed from the deed? If not

3) Since his name is not on the mortgage

4) Any other options I'm not considering?

""His"" Car:

I) Due to the identity theft, it belongs to the partner. My friend has been paying the full amount of the car payments and insurance since it was purchased. 

Since the remaining balance on the car is only a few thousand dollars, and the partner has offered to take over the remaining payments for the car and the insurance.

They wrote up a simple ""agreement"" basically just stating that the partner will assume the payments for the car and the insurance and then sell the car to my friend for $1 when the car is paid off. They took it to a notary and signed the document. 

Questions: 

1) Would this be a legally binding document? In my search, we are worried that the partner may have a change of heart and then call the car in as stolen, etc. He's not the nicest guy. (The partner)

2) Are there any sites that might have a form they could use in this case? Something that would be legally binding? Would they then take this to a notary

I am a commercial driver here in Houston, keeping my record clean and my insurance rates low is very important.

Anyway, but I also had a green light. The insurance company(-ies) are investigating to see who's at fault, which looks like I probably will be. Coming from metro New York, I've only ever seen protected-left hand turns, and it's up in the air if the light at the time of the accident was in protected-turn mode or yield-to-turn mode. I was cited for failure to yield, which sucks, but everyone makes mistakes I suppose. I am due in court on the 16th to address the citation

The problem I'm currently stuck right now is that the officer that processed the accident did some very jaw-dropping things that could've played very key roles in the investigation of the accident.

Directly following the accident, I limped to the side of the road and laid down), before rushing over to the other car.

He asked me for my license, took one look at it, saw the ""Under 21"" tag in big red letters, and smirked at me. He then told me to stand near the corner of the building while he ""ran my license"". I knew right then and there that it was going to be a long night.

The original witness and two other witnesses - another driver who was behind the other vehicle right before the accident, but I figured that their information would be in the police report. 

I then decided to take pictures of the scene, AND PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY."" Shocked and somewhat frightened, I followed his commands. The tow trucks came and began to hook the cars up to tow them out of the street. I jogged over to the car (still in pain) so that I could get my glasses from the floorboard as I'm nearly blind without them. Again, he scolded me to get back where he told me to stand, in a pretty angry tone of voice.

I did. Confused as to what was going on, and yelled ""I TOLD YOU TO GET OFF THE PHONE. PUT IT AWAY. NOW."" I hung up just as the name of the intersection came out of my mouth, now pretty scared. 

The other driver was still sitting on the side of the road, he finally came over to me and asked ""what happened."" in a very blasé manner. I told him what I recalled (I didn't see the car coming, it was blocked by another car waiting to make a left hand turn southbound-to-eastbound, so I didn't know anything until the moment of impact), and he sighed, wrote me a citation for failure to yield, told me my court date

My father-in-law then showed up, very obviously intoxicated as he was having a hard time standing up and his speech was slurred. My FIL went over to the tow truck driver to arrange the car's transport back home, when I turned to the officer. I asked ""the passenger and driver of the other car look intoxicated, and there's open containers in their vehicle. Could you breathalyze us?"" He scoffed, didn't even look up and said ""look, I'm a patrol unit. I don't /carry/ breathalyzers."" I then asked if he could get a DWI unit dispatched, and he replied ""no need. she doesn't appear drunk to me. you're free to go.""

I was appalled. If this wasn't a textbook case of when-to-breathalyze-someone

So, no contact information from any witnesses, nothing. Nothing more than a paper citation.

I couldn't sleep at all the next three nights. Eventually, which they said sure to. 

I opened up the PDF of the report and was shocked at what I found. No mention of alcohol anywhere in the report, the passenger-of-the-other-vehicle's statement, and the statement of the driver of the vehicle behind the woman, which only read one sentence (he was Asian and did not speak English fluently): ""I was behind the SUV when the red car turned in front of her."" That's it. That's the whole statement from him.

So now, there's no witnesses to say that I had a green light, there's no witnesses to say that they saw the other driver appeared intoxicated, no witnesses to say there were open containers in the other vehicle, nothing. I'm now stuck up piss creek with no paddles and a leaking boat. I asked the insurance company what I could do about it and they said I could get a lawyer, but also said that it's probably not worth it as there's nothing in the police report to help me or support my claims. 

What should I do, had it out for me from the very beginning for no apparent reason, and went out of his way to make sure that I got the ass-end-of-the-stick for the entire situation. I'm 4 months shy of turning 21, and insurance premiums are already ridiculous. I'm hoping that the failure-to-yield citation can be plead-down or even dismissed, which will save my driving record, but having an accident on my insurance record will make my premiums skyrocket to unsustainable amounts. The fate of which really rests on the outcome of your advice.

Does she have any options?",AtomicPanda82,15,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jtz5a/pa_usa_friend_got_her_bus_run_taken_away_and/, so I figured I'd have a clearer mind to explain the situation and ask for advice.


Before I explain, USA and works for the Penn Trafford school district as a bus monitor.


My friend started working as a bus monitor for Penn Trafford school district in April of this year. She passed all her tests with flying colors and was put on a run immediately after that. She was on her father's run, because they said she was doing such good work (the kids on her bus are a bit troubled and don't really listen, but she's gotten them under control for the most part).


She had a meeting for work today, they said that another monitor wanted it (for more hours) and that monitor had called in a union rep, who told them that, because my friend had worked less than 30 days total, the other employee got priority and the bus lot HAD to give her the run. Note that my friend did not give up her run or ask for a different one; she was completely banking on doing that run when school started up again.


The bus lot didn't want to take the run away from my friend, but in the end, the lot said they had no choice other than to give it up to the other monitor who wanted it because of the union rep forcing their hands. As a side note, this monitor who took her run had previously turned it down the school year prior. Again, my friend **was not fired** and is still considered an employee, but as of right now, she has zero hours and no run.


So


1. Is the 30 days thing a bunch of bull? If it matters


2. Is this legal? Are they allowed to just take her job (which she didn't give up and was doing well on) and give it to someone else, she WASN'T fired. She also isn't considered ""laid off"". Does she have any recourse for this, or is she more or less screwed?

He seats them in front of him
I've told my sisters that it's dangerous for them to be on the thing together and told the oldest of them to tell their father that he should not be doing that. It worked for maybe 2 days
I confronted him about it this time, that he either walks them to the park which is a few blocks away or no go. Things started to escalate from then on ending with violent implications on both our ends. 
He called my mother to tell her he's taking them to the park
He was getting desperate at this point so he called her again demanding he'll be taking them. 
My mother was at work at the time so she didn't have time for his tantrums. She then called me telling me to let him take them but that it would be the last time. 
I was pretty pissed at my mom for this but I obliged. 
I let them go with him but I made it clear that it'd be the last time he does this. He didn't seem to care stating that I have no business in this.

Here is my story (unimportant details changed for anonymity):

I recently rented a car from Dulles Int. Airport to travel to my girlfriends place and spend a vacation (2 weeks) with her and her family.  At the end of my vacation I am driving back to the airport and am about 40 mins away and in plenty of time for my flight when I get a flat.  It is 8pm and I am in an isolated rural area with no sign of life nearby.  Despite this I pull over to replace the wheel with the spare.  Its missing but there foam repair kit.  However there is no Jack that you need to make this work (foam doesn't set right unless wheel is off the ground).  I try the foam repair anyway and manage to drive another 600 metres before deciding its too dangerous.

I call for assistance but can't get it to work on my UK phone and I quickly run out of credit trying to call various numbers.  So I call 911 and the kindly dispatcher puts me through to the rental companies roadside assistance.

They tell me that someone was on their way and would I like to be kept up to date via text message.  I say that I'd rather stay on the line for as I'm unsure about the reliability of their texts to my UK phone.  After about 2 hours with no assistance the line goes dead.  I try calling again via 911 but this time the dispatcher isn't so helpful (fair play).  So I decide to wait...

Eventually, just leave the can of repair foam which is often useless, certainly without a jack.

Eventually I make it to the airport

My expenses as a result of this are as follows:

Extra Flight: $1400
Phone Calls: $20
Food at airport: $30
Missed Days work: $120
Total: 1570


The total cost of the car rental:  $660 (including optional breakdown cover)

I also feel I should be compensated for my time and the distress caused as missing a days work has been very stressful. I was thinking $2000 (as  a starting point) should be adequate given the negligence of the company. But I need someone who knows more about this to advise me.

How should I approach the complaint?
Where do I stand from a legal point of view?  Will they pay my expenses? ($1570)
Am I able to claim for distress without going through legal proceedings?
How much do you think I can get?

Thanks in advance


EDIT:  Thanks everyone for your help. Some great points that I think will be really helpful. Just wanted to clarify a few points.
911 - I know its for emergencies only. I'm not going to debate the legality of it, I was in a foreign country in an isolated area and it was the only number I could call on my UK cell as I was out of credit. The police officer I eventually found didn't have a problem with it.
Spare tire - I didn't check. I will next time. Who here has ever checked for a spare when renting a vehicle?
Foam - I'll read up on it. I might have got this wrong. I did actually spray it in and try to drive for a bit but it just wasn't safe.
Insurance - I have travel insurance. I will be informing them them and seeing what I can claim
Rental Company - Does have a significant UK presence and it was booked through an agent. I will be taking it up with both of them. Should I not be satisfied with their response they shall be named and shamed.
Contract - I have it and will be reading it carefully

      We pulled over, I hand him my insurance info, and pen and paper and he looks at it hands it back and just asks for my name and number in case he decides to get it fixed. No police were called, no report or anything, he was alone in his car, I had two other girls with me. So three days go by and he calls me and says he got an estimate for $950.00 and that now his signal isn't working, mind you I hit him with my license plate cover only and left just a small hole.

To cut to the chase, get a loan, etc. I should have known that was all lies. The agreement was that I would pay for the visa ($900) and he would pay for my plane ticket out here and my LTR after 6 months. Well, he said that he couldn't do the plane ticket so I paid for that as well.. As soon as I got here, things changed. He stopped being affectionate, distant, withdrawn, threatening. He told me I had to pay for the LTR as well (950 pound). I did.. because god


The agreement was that I would keep the house absolutely spotless and clean every day (since I couldn't work for 6 months until my leave to remain) and he would take care of everything else. I was keeping the 850 pound for cigarettes and extra expenses (shampoo, which I have adhered to most of the time.

Our relationship has taken a turn for the worse. I tell him I'm unhappy, that I will be homeless. He says that he had a prenup drawn up before I came out that declared all his assets his and his alone (prior to relationship). That he had his flat and his car transferred to his father's name for a pound before we got married. That if I left him, he would declare me a visa scammer and then he would take me to the cleaners, sue me for everything I had. That he would take my FAFSA money and anything that my grandfather (who raised me) left me in his will.. my car (broken) basically anything I have left.

I don't want any of his assets. I don't want his flat. Or his car. I don't want anything from. I just want a plane ticket home (even though I will most likely be homeless) and 950 pound for the LTR money. He agreed (prior to this maliciousness) that if we ever broke up he would at least do that for me. Now I don't know what to do.. I just want a plane ticket and the visa refund so I can at least get my car fixed and have a chance to go back to school and make something of my life..

He is threatening to take me for everything, not be able to go back to school, or anything. He knows I have nothing. I don't have family to help me (my grandfather died and he was all I had.. in arguments my husband has threatened to burn and destroy all pictures and letters of my grandfather I had).

My mom makes all the money in the house and pays all the bills. My dad helps with some purchases of food

If my dad tries to lecture Michelle but she would just say he has no right to tell her anything to do because he doesn't pay any bills in the house and she won't listen to him. She calls out my dad on not having a good education and a bad job and says hes basically useless in the house.
My mom works graveyard shift and usually comes home to yelling from my father. When my sister yells at my mom she lets it happen. She sometimes cries and she feels like everyone is being mean to her. She doesn't punish, if Michelle yelled at my mom and then asked my mom for money then she would probably give my sister money. Btw, I go out of my way to be very respectful to my mom now but I feel she doesn't appreciate it and I'm fine with that as long as I'm not adding negativity to her life. So I'm not implying I'm being mean to her as well.

This is a conflict between my mom and my sister and I'm not sure if my dad was present at the moment. My sister is always making my mom feel bad for things around the house.

For example; My mom put granola cereal in a jar that my sister puts oatmeal in. My sister yelled at my mom for this and I woke up to it in the morning and then called my mom a piece of shit.

I've tried to talk to her in the past but she will say it's none of my business or that I have no right to say anything because I started community college over after being 2 years in because I wanted to do Engineering and not Nutrition Science. And she keeps a 4.0 gpa and wants to go to a good school.

I remember once I was in the kitchen and my mom was trying to cook a ham. She asked my sister ""do I have to add water to this ham?"" and my sister was saying ""No

So

She said it was none of my business and I have no right to say anything. I started yelling and saying she causes mom too much stress. She is VERY passive aggressive and she starts smiling and chuckling. So I pushed her and she fell on her backpack. She ended up going into her room which we were in front of and I stood in front of the door. She said get out of the room and how she didn't want to hear it but I said no

A few months ago I told my friend about how my sister abuses my mom and acts like she owns the house with trying to control my mom and he told me that I needed to sit down and talk to her but I know she won't listen to me from past experience because she will bring up how I used to be very angry and take out my anger on my other sister Danielle or how I'm going to community college. (which was by choice because I'm very undecided) Even those arguments I feel are very superficial. It was past events that happened over 2 years ago and I didn't physically abuse someone until I pushed my sister Michelle today.

She's getting the divorce

She wants full custody and the house that we own outright (no loan).

We both have full time jobs

We're still both in the same house. I'm in the bed

She had her mother buy her a car we couldn't afford after deciding on a divorce because I was unwilling to incur the debt.

She makes slightly more than me on an average basis

We're in Arkansas.

It is out of town so to make things easier we hired a wedding planner.  It was supposed to make our lives easier but it did anything but. 

  The planner said that he could get our guests a great deal at the hotel we are getting married at.  He said to send the money directly to him as that was the only way our guests would get the discount.  One of the guests called the hotel to verify her room and they didn't have any reservations listed.  We investigated

  He claimed that it was a misunderstanding and that he would fix it.  We kept calling him and it kept not being fixed.  We traveled there and personally made sure he paid it, she left it at her house, her car broke down, her keys were locked in her car.  We hounded him all day, and he could never produce the check so we told him to meet us at the bank in the morning to withdraw a check that we would personally take to the hotel.  We were relentless...this money belonged to our friends/family!  He did come through with the money in the morning at the bank, and we took care of the hotel.

  He was supposed to help my fiance's mother rent a house for the wedding weekend.  He said that he knew the owner and if we paid him

  We then started checking up on the vendors.  We had been given receipts that were allegedly proof of payment from the vendors.  When we started calling them, and they don't do anything offsite.

  When we began our search for a wedding planner, it was the same number he gave us for the bride's mother's rental house!  He has a number he uses to lie to people with!  We want to trace this to see if it is registered to him.

  This guy is definitely being dishonest with us.  We have gone to see some of the weddings he has planned to see if he keeps his word on anything.  They do look beautiful, email records of our conversations, and we have recorded some of our meetings to get all the things he has promised us on the record.

  I know that if he breeches the contract we can take him to civil court

Is there any chance that at some point (hopefully sooner rather than later), it seems likely that it won't go anywhere.

A few additional things I've noticed that may or may not be relevant in some way:

– The list of items seized included more items than were listed on the copy given to me. (I already suspected this.)

– The affidavit lists something I said to a police officer as probable cause. I did not say anything to the police until they put me in a position of much higher emotional distress (as if it weren't bad enough already). They embellished that comment to sound more incriminating.

– There is medical data that would normally be protected under HIPAA in the affidavit

– I can actually make a pretty compelling argument for why this particular police department and some of the officers involved would have something against me personally due to legitimate professional activity a while back that wasn't good for them. I also have information and evidence about multiple federal violations on part of the department and some of what they seized indicates that. 

– I have no criminal record or history of violence or substance abuse or anything.

The issue we are currently dealing with is this. There is an individual who has special needs who likes to come play. We are not at all sure exactly what his needs are. He needs supervising, we like being able to provide a place where he can play and have fun. He does pay entree fee.

However, but she is seventeen, and has demonstrated on multiple occasions that she is irresponsible and cannot be trusted to look after her brother. We've had a case where they left to go looking for something at night, and her and her friends left him in the field when he couldn't keep up. Other players and referees stepped up and helped him back to the fort. 

We've told his father that he cannot be left at the game without supervision, but as said before, we play at a very isolated place, if something very bad happens, I have no idea how long it might take for emergency personnel to reach us.

We don't want to punish him or his sister, if he's being watched, but he gets into trouble if left unsupervised. In those cases, we have to take one of the refs off of the staff, and assign them to watch the brother.

What I'd like to do, and that his sister is unacceptable as a guardian for him. I'd like to lay out what the consequences of what leaving him unattended would be. I hope we will not need to act on them, but if this continues, we need to be able to act on it. 

Which comes to my question. What can we legally do if he is left at a game again without a guardian or chaperone? Iv'e been trying to read the ADA, and I'm afraid of the game/business getting sued.

We had an arrangement were we would keep the marital home and live in it together

The house we live is still in both of our names

Questions:

They want to send him to a rehab facility in another county for what could be a year of recovery. We both had questions about how custody would work in that aspect since, and he is obviously unable to make the trek himself back and forth often to see him. We want to protect ourselves against any problems. Would I get into trouble for not taking him to see my ex on a proper schedule? Could he come back later and say that I didn't bring my son to see him enough? 

Do we need to get some sort of proper custody order in place? 

Without him contributing I am having trouble paying for after school daycare for our 6 year old. I want to apply for discounted tuition or state vouchers for daycare through the state. Would they some how require some sort of child support order in his case? It could be a while before he is able to work. 

In the event of his death

It has been years since we visited the court together. He is at a point right now where he is stable but visiting the court might be possible for him medically.

Did we mess up by continuing to live together and not having a real custody order after the divorce? 

Thanks for any advice. I understand that this isn't legal advice but I would love just a point in the right direction.

We are planning to see a lawyer but I just wanted to know what we needed to address

Note: After he comes back home, but we just can't be married to each other. Our son does love having both parents under one roof. Especially while his dad is ill. Would continuing to live together be a problem considering we aren't a couple in the traditional sense?

1351108955.0,120vjv,I don't know what to do. On active duty and my wife asked for a divorce and moved herself and our child out of our apartment. ,airforcedivorce,13,1,7,"I am in desperate need of some advice. I am in the Air Force

My child is 3 years old. And I won't be able to go back home to Louisiana until a few weeks from now (I have been gone for almost 6 months).

My wife basically told me over the phone that she does not love me anymore

She moved out of our apartment into one of her friends houses -- taking our child with her. She recently got a low paying full time job (for the first time since we've been married) at a bank...it makes me feel as if she'd been planning the divorce for a while since she had no interest in having a job before. She also used the job as a reason for not coming to Tampa the entire time I've been here -- so I haven't been able to see my child in almost 6 months.

**I just don't know what to do financial-wise and custody-wise.**

I’ve been sending them most of my money from active duty. She even asked for more money on top of what I have been sending her (which, spending lots of money on alcohol while out, buying tons of new trashy/club clothes, and she even recently got a large tattoo. I want to cut her off completely because I hate to see my hard earned money being used for trashy things that in no way benefit our child (I don't consider those things trashy, but the way she goes about it and the actual tattoo she got are trashy). There was even an ENTIRE MONTH where she pawned our kid off on her grandparents and strictly used the money I sent for herself to finance going to the club and hanging out with her friends. But I feel like if I cut down how much I send, she will hold it over my head in court as being a deadbeat dad. Also I bought her a new car right before I left that is in my name (she has made no payments at all toward it). And now, I recently heard that she is trying to trade it in for a different car while I am still on active duty. Is there any way I can stop her from doing that? And I know that she will try to take as much money from me as possible during the divorce since that is how she has always been; and I’m afraid of going bankrupt between legal fees and child support. 

I am also unsure about what to do for custody. Do I have any chance to get any custody of our kid? I know traditionally, and our kid deserves that. 

Also, we yelled, and the neighbors called the cops -- but in NO WAY did I lay a hand on her (I’m just not that kind of person). The cop came and my wife lied and I had to spend a night in jail. She didn’t press charges, but she has said she’ll use this to keep the kid if she needs to. 

Sorry for the length and grammar...I’m just so in shock right now and looking for some advice. I want to see a lawyer

1348738149.0,10k15d,Speeding ticket in driveway - California,DrivewaySpeeding,14,3,40,"This evening I returned home at 10pm from a group meeting. Upon pulling into my driveway, UPS


What happened next caught me by total surprise. As I approached the officers, one of them asked for my license, registration, and proof of insurance. I provided my drivers license and told the officer the rest of my information was in the car. I asked him why I needed to provide the information and he informed me I was being ""pulled over"" for speeding (his words, not mine). I want to be perfectly clear, at this time my car was sitting in a driveway in front of my house, off

After the officer took my ID, despite my information being easily accessible and illuminated from the passenger side. At this point I was made aware that I must get in the vehicle, roll down the window, and remain there as I was being ""detained in MY vehicle"".Following this point the officers drove their cars across the street and lit my car and house up, blocking me from leaving my driveway. (Where was I supposed to go? I was home.)

I handed my information - all current and readily accessible - to the officer. He ran my information through the system. At this point I want to defend myself and growth as an individual. When I was younger I lived in Los Angeles, I received my first ticket and two others, all for speeding in 6 months. At this point I drastically changed my driving habits and am proud to say I have gone without incident for the past three years. The smaller town mindset became part of life and showed me a way of life alternate to that of LA. Additionally, I recently purchased a Suburu Imprezza (I LOVE HER!!!) and one of my favorite features in the car is the ability to drive it with a no clutch manual. The time I passed in front of the officers, I was turning off a side road, driving the hills. This is manual transition heaven. I, as usual, took the hills

Turning onto my street is 1 short block (3 house lots), ""What did you do, throw the e-brake and drift into the driveway?"" Accusing officer had my approximate speed set at 37. (It would be pretty hard to accelerate to 37, then quickly make my driveway.) The officers were on foot, even the ticket said they had no radar.

When handed my ticket and asked to sign, and asked if I could go into my home. Officer granted me permission to enter my own home like I am some animal.

As I began to take pictures of the squad cars parked outside my house the officer informed me of a ticket error. He had forgotten to write down my proof of insurance - which I provided. He asked me if he could correct it, failure to provide proof of insurance is written as a violation, and on this ticket my accusing officer was just too eager to write me a ticket to even complete it. To add to the errors, my name on the ticket is spelled incorrectly as is the title holder of the vehicle (my father).

This is my first time posting in this subreddit and I'm really at a loss of what to do. I will try to make this very clear and concise so I dont burden you with a textwall.

I own a business in Ohio. Friday, literally burning through the carpet to foundation. She did not stop until a nearby business had someone run in and remove her foot from the gas/car.

I was not inside the building, but mentally I think they're having issues.

My question is this: I've itemized everything damaged in the accident...some of it small,500 equipment. Ive made a huge list with approximate cost and whatnot for everything in order to help things along. Am I going to be scrutinized to death over everything, and do I have any options or defense to explain that rubble and fine mortar dust CAN damage, and HAS damaged computers within the building?

Lastly, glass, etc out. The next work day was continued cleanup and inventory and diagnostic of what was, and was not destroyed in the accident.

My store front is just a 9 x 10 cardboard slab bolted to the building now. Somehow my actual door survived. I'm losing business daily now because it LOOKS like we're shut down. I have no open sign anymore, why would they still come in with my store front gone? It looks like we're a shanty now.

How would I, then going after the driver's insurance told me to bill hourly what we charge for what we do...I have for the first three days I mentioned before. But what about afterwards? Do I have any grounds to claim I will continue to lose business until it's fixed? If so, how do I determine how much?

I'm really just upset over everything, and I want the money due to me that I WOULD be making if I had a store front anymore.

First off

I got caught attempting to leave Walmart with $97 worth of merchandise, the officer let me go with a citation (but made it very clear that it was still an arrest). The violation was Class B Theft. This is my first offense, I am an adult, and I live in Texas. My citation says the judge's name, court, and the date says ""ON OR BEFORE 8/19 2013 AT 12PM"". I called in and they said they hadn't received my case yet, so I'm not sure if I'm actually able to go in before that date although I really need to.

I'm supposed to leave the country at the end of August for a $35

I know my situation where I got off with a citation and arrest is rare rather than spending a night in county jail and having to post bail

About how much will Walmart Asset Protection charge me for the $97 worth of merchandise?
Will I still be able to leave the country for the scholarship?
Am I just getting a fine or will I be put on probation?
How far will pleading not guilty get me?
Is there any way for me to handle everything after I get back from the scholarship program in June 2014?

I live in Washington State, and I am assuming our neighbors as well.

I have spoken to him about it multiple times, he is stoned 99% of the time. I have also spoken to management about it, and they keep saying they are going to ""do"" something about it, yet nothing ever comes of it.

Our manager is a very nice lady, and how we are some of the best renters she has as we don't cause problems.

The person who lived in the apartment next to us before she(finally) kicked him out

We have already spent probably a months worth of rent(or more) trying to get rid out our bedbug infestation

I have two small children, especially my 3 yr old. She has them on her face, back, arms, legs, everywhere. My 1 yr old has been lucky so far and not had many bites, but still.

I have bites all over as well, something my 3 yr old doesn't have, and so she has open sores all over her body from scratching.

We have tried bombing, and cleaned all our carpets and upholstery, we threw out our couch, all of our clothes are in bags, all of the kids toys are in bags, we have washed **EVERYTHING** over and over to try and get rid of them, the only thing we haven't done is called an exterminator, and then another $175 per treatment after that, they would just be back a few weeks later as the *entire* complex would need to be treated at the same time

I have spoken to the manager about this, and says we shouldn't have to either, but hasn't given us another option, or *any* options.

We have complained *multiple* times

We are planning to move, *constantly* having to spend money *just* to mitigate the problem, not solve it.

Is there any legal ground for us to stand on? I am grabbing the rental agreement as I type this

I just looked over the rental agreement and there is *nothing* about hazardous living conditions or whatever

Going to look up state law

**EDIT:** Thanks for all your advice. So far from what I take we *cannot* withhold rent for any reason. And as we are planning to move

We are on a month-to-month lease there won't be any problems with that

1374679490.0,1iyl1i,[Northern Virginia] - Question about highly restrictive employment contract,throwaway_legalq,13,2,9,"The wife works for an after school music studio

Back story

The wife has worked at the studio now for almost 10 years.  The contract is signed by all employees (~5-8) in a group setting the Friday before the school year begins in September.  Contract is valid from September through June.  So about 72 hours pass between contract signing and the first day of work.  The wife has asked about striking some of the more restrictive/outlandish stuff

Most of the contract is a Non-Compete:

* Cannot work for a competing music studio within 50 mile radius 

* This contract and its restrictions exist for 3 years

* Any business with a current or past clients (within past 3 years) no matter if the work is outside the scope of the services the studio offers, and a former student asks for her services, and the studio found out, suddenly she is in debt to the studio.  Same thing goes if she quits or is terminated, and a former student wants a private piano lesson at our home.  

* If she wants to quit, so I can say without a doubt, that dollar amount would be substantial.  There is not an ""extenuating circumstances"" provision.  So, if she is in an accident, or is put on bed rest because of a difficult pregnancy, per the contract, she is not protected.


I know Virginia does not take too kindly to overly restrictive employment contracts.  That being said

Thank you all in advance for your time!

After his wife had moved in with us, keyed again after it was fixed, nails were placed under her tires, and a rock was thrown at one of my dad's cars that was gated....we don't have any video of this but we assumed it was him all along and couldn't do anything until we finally got the video. This all happened over 4 months.

We were able to get video from a neighbor the night he keyed 2 of the cars belonging to my family and placed nails under the tires. And another night where he broke the side mirror of another one of our cars and stole her license plate. On the same night he keyed our cars

So

The police did not arrest him but he told them he did what was on the video and said he would be willing to pay for the damages.

Should we deal with him directly or should we just sue?

All we want is the money to repair our cars so they are in the condition they were in before he damaged them. Can we get the estimates and present it to him and  ask for that total? Can we ask him to pay for the camera system we had to install to deter him? 

I know it's a lot but if anyone can guide us before we proceed it'll be appreciated. The detective we worked with was not at all the greatest and it took constant pestering over a month for him to finally call my uncle him.

I have been as cooperative as I can with this situation. The latest ruling has given me access to both son and daughter one day every two weeks. But it is still supervised. It has been a full year since the separation. Yet I still can't make progress on removing the supervision

My mother and I have been over at the house cleaning out some of the old stuff she left behind from when she lived there as her primary residence. She never officially had a date of being ""moved out."" It's a 4 bedroom house with a large plot of land and a 2 car garage FULL of storage boxes. 

It's been very hot in our area so we had the air conditioning on. At 2 in the afternoon he came in *stumbling* drunk. No exaggeration. He had a sober-ish friend with him that witnessed the entire incident. Paul started whining that the AC was on and that it was costing him money. I told him it's reasonable to allow the people working in such heat to have AC if it's available. He bumbled on about how he pays the bills around here (lol) and that he chooses if the AC is on or not, yelling at my mother and telling her that her house wasn't even worth renting (he's not renting lol). I suggested he find a place worthy of renting and that August 1st was a convenient 33 days away and implied that we'll expecting him gone by then. I yelled at him to leave and he went to his room. My mother stood by speechless (she's kind of a ""mouse"" type of person, non-confrontational).

I left the house after that incident and told her husband what happened and about the 30 day notice. The house is in my mom's name and I have no legal standing in sending him a 30 day notice

**The Threat/tl;dr**:
I woke up this morning to a voicemail left at midnight from Paul, come up with a better insult!) but at the end he threatened to bash my face in if I ever ""talk to him like that again."" 

...That scared me. I realize that yesterday he was drunk

Basically

* What options are there for landlords of non-written agreement holding non-payer tenants to evict with an earlier than 30 day notice?
* Are there notices to get someone out of a property that isn't your primary residence that is threatening physical violence against your children? 
* Is it safer to just contact the Sheriff's Department and give Paul a 30 day notice? I honestly feel I'd need protection if I or someone else were to hand Paul an eviction notice and I don't want to give him any more extra time than he needs.

I lived there until July 9th of 2009. At the time I moved out

Fast forward 4 years to yesterday (June 2013) and I receive a call from a new manager that has taken up residence there at the complex. She is going through old filing cabinets and comes across my file which apparently has a note attached to it from one of the previous managers that is dated August 2009 and it states something along the lines of (Faxed bill update to resident, and a ledger with the lease fee attached. They claim that I owe them ~$1500 for breaking my lease in 2009. When I moved out I paid everything that the manager asked me to pay and went along with my life. When I didnt hear anything from them for the span of 4 years I assumed that I paid everything that they asked of me.

They called me yesterday with this new found information that she came across and she is asking that I pay it immediately or else I would need to be sent to a collections agency. I asked them to give me a few days to look through everything.

I contacted their district office and told them that I paid what was asked of me in 2009 and that I hadn't been contacted in nearly 4 years and their incompetence in misfiling is not something I should be responsible for. She stated that unless I have proof that I paid all of my fees (via a bank statement) then I would need to pay the fee ASAP or be sent to collections.

I spoke with an attorney that works in the office where I am employed and they stated that my lease agreement does not have the words ""seal"" in brackets ( ""[]"") beside my signature. They claim that a non-""seal"" contract is limited to a 3-year window in which they can exercise their rights. He stated that they have gone outside that window and thus

I relayed this message to both the district manager and property manager and they used the same intimidation techniques and told me to either pay (set up a payment plan) or they would send me to collections. Then they added that if it came to it

I have no idea what to do. My attorney claims that they dont have much of a leg to stand on since they are trying to collect on a contract that is past their legal rights (due to limitations) but the apartment complex isn't listening to any part of that.

Do I really have to take them to court to get this fee removed? Or can I draft a legal letter to their property lawyer stating the same law of limitations on this contract that is 4 years old and hope that he looks at it and says ""yeah

**BACKGROUND:
**
My BF got an opportunity to work for the Boy Scouts of America as an aquatics director.  Basically he manages all the waterfront activities.  They trained him (non-paid) for seven 12 hour-plus days and he earned his lifeguard trainer cert and a host of other Boy Scout certifications.  This job is for about 8 weeks.  

The issues have since started.  First, many of these days are 13-plus hours.  And now instead of 5 days a week, it is 6 days a week.  Oh yeah, you are not supposed to leave at night (we live 50 minutes away and there is no traffic).  The living arrangements are smaller than that allotted to inmates at CSP Sac prison (source: I used to work there).  They are hiring unqualified staff for lifeguard positions that have never been a lifeguard, some of which he is trying to train that may not be able to hack the water proficiency, so potentially not enough staff.  And on a minor point, the camp director has stated that the entire campground is smoke free, nor will there be and those found smoking can be terminated immediately.   

Finally, but from what I have read, all employees may be salaried, so exact info on the employment stipulations are not known.

**QUESTIONS:** 

Under California law

If you are working 13+ hours

Is it legal to require an employee to live on site?

Besides “salary”
**QUESTIONS FOR US:**

Why did he take this job?  He has been lifeguard for a long time, he loves to camp, and let’s face it, there is not a lot out there right now for jobs.

Did he not know what he was getting into?  No.  From the demands of training, we feel a lot of things were not truthfully represented.   If they were, he would never have taken the position, or we would have at least had time to work with my schedule, or be better prepared for the challenges.  

So why not just walk away from the job?  Fair question.  His position is extremely tough to fill-perhaps now we know why.  Some camps will have no waterfront activities this year due to staff shortages, there will be no waterfront activities for the entire summer-no swimming, wading, canoeing, etc.  He does not want that on his conscious.  Also the Boy Scouts have been known to blacklist people (they have their fingers in a lot of organizations apparently), so unless things are really bad, we do not want to deal with that fallout as well.  

If the living space sucks

Are you going to ask for some exemptions towards camp policy?  Yes

Smoking is bad for you, but I knew that going in.  I knew that if I was going to be miserable, I at least knew what I was getting into.  He is trialing patches right now, but has failed Wellbutrin.   So yes, this is kind of a big deal.

Let's say a table walks out with the signed copy of the credit card authorization

Then the house contacts the server, or found an unsigned copy of an authorization. The servers are told that they will have to pay back the house for the entire amount of the bill. The implication is that the servers have to pay up, or be fired, but the house never directly says what the consequences would be if a server refused to pay.

In the last few months servers have had to pay checks ranging from $30 to $275. Is this legal or just immoral?

My dads license was also suspended and he contacted them and they gave him a ""deal"". The total damage is like $2000 or something. He paid $700 and was told to refer me to them.

I called and they said I'm responsible for the remaining balance. 

Few things:

1. I was 16 when this happened and only spoke to the owner of the vehicle and my father. Nothing else other than that.

2. The vehicle wasn't mine. It was my dads car.

3. This happened in 2002 and the only reason we knew it was still a problem was because my dad tried to renew his license and couldn't due to it being suspended.

He has made zero effort to talk to us directly, but if he's irrational and doesn't want anything short of us not being able to have company over (we are late shifters and this is when we are awake) then I'll just have to let the cops come and decide.

My question is this: since we are not consistently loud, etc, since this guy gets woken up by, apparently, doors closing? Can a cop give you a ticket for somebody who doesn't live at your house slamming their car door on their way out of the residence or does the cop have to show up and hear loud noises, like a party?

If he does hear us talking from inside the closed garage door

I could use an idea of what kind of cards I have in my hand before I talk to him. Hopefully he accepts an apology and can get over it, this is far from a large disturbance and I feel like the cops will show up and apologize for wasting time...

After they addressed all my questions I turned the waiver into them and then asked for a copy for my records. The woman said they don't usually do that and asked a co-worker about it. She informed me that it would cost $75. I obviously balked at this

Her manager came in and she was immediately defensive and combative, for my records.

But why would you keep it? So I can review the rights I've waived in the future. 

Why would you want to do that? I don't know

She then told me that the waiver was now their property and that I could have my lawyer subpoena it

I just sat there for a few seconds and said

Yup.

Well

That surprised her, even weather (they do reschedule for any if you request it though). So we did my jump, literally everything other than the women in the office was perfect.

The water has caused a bit of damage (all of which I have pictures of): The rug in my kitchen is ruined and I had to throw away around $75 in perishable food items that were covered in gross ceiling water.  The water somehow got into many of my cabinets (that will probably be fixable by washing my dishes).  My apartment is probably running at 100% humidity.  It smells disgusting.

I spoke to the apartment management company this morning, when I mentioned reimbursement for the damaged items that I had to throw away (which is realistically about $125 worth of items, but potentially more because I haven't really looked through the entire kitchen to assess the damage), they said they wouldn't pay for that because the burst pipe wasn't caused by their negligence.  (I would add that the maintenance man mentioned this same situation happened two doors down from mine earlier this year.)  

I have renter's insurance

I'm also concerned about the costs increasing over time.  I have health problems that make dust from construction and mold from water damage a real issue.

I am very much involved in my child's life despite her living across country.  Since january the mother has had a child with another man and subsequently began absconding from my communications.  Therefore I haven't talked to my child since January and missed both hers and my birthdays (mother turned phone off).  

I am a 26 year old full time college student.  I know it doesn't look good being 26 but even the mother's family agrees that I am an important part of the child's life.  I feel like I should point that out.

Court was set 3 weeks ago for May 30th. 

1. Should I file for a mod to reflect the mother living across country?
2. Should I also file for shared custody? (why?/Not?)

First I'll explain what's going on:
About a week ago an old friend came over to my house (without warning) asking for help finding some weed.  I no longer smoke but I still know where to get it so I drove him to a dealer's house in another town.  My car was overheating when we got to there

So the cops take our licenses and run our information, where we were coming from, etc.  Eventually they explain that we were sighted behaving suspiciously and visiting a well-known house, to which I explain that my car was having issues.  They ask us to step out of the car, search us, and ask for permission to search the car.  I decline and so a K9 unit is called.  After almost an hour the dog arrives and they find the weed.  My friend denies knowing it was there and so I am arrested and spend all day in jail.  I have a simple possession charge and court on April 4th in a small Kansas town.


Now my problem is that I have no money to hire a lawyer and I'm going to tech school to be a Pharmacy Technician

My questions are:

* Was this a legal Terry stop and search?  They didn't give me a ticket for the turn signal..  We weren't intoxicated and didn't smell like weed so I'm not sure what the reasonable suspicion for detaining us was.  Do I have a chance of fighting this based on that?

* What are my chances of getting deferred adjudication or the charges dropped?  I have two misdemeanors on my juvenile record (one is a traffic offense) but I'm genuinely trying to get my life back on track

* Will this affect my student loans?  I may continue with school and just switch programs in case this goes on my record

So I've ran in to an issue. A colleague and I just started a business and had someone who we don't know (anonymous) make a quick placeholder picture for us. 

I put this picture on the website while we were in just planning and development stage, luckily for us the image on the website was just a temporary placeholder and we had removed it before we even received that letter in the mail, or very close to it. Their letter in the mail also showed screenshots of the website and the picture in use.

Now I don't really know how to approach this. I tried to call their contact and discuss terms of cancelling this but he was away until Monday. 

We certainly don't have any cash flow (or even a bank account) and we didn't even have the business registered yet while using this placeholder image. It was simply for making a concept of the way the website might look. 

Where do I go from here? Should I be scared about their threat for litigation?

1339520978.0,uy7ff,Called police; They made things worse; Helped ex steal car; Now covering it up and refusing to take action.,NoCatsPleaseImSane,11,1,15,"I would like to recover my car from my ex-wife


I called the police for help, yes I can fight off a 5’5” 98 pound girl, but I *REFUSE* to even hold her wrists to protect myself as one tiny bruise and she’ll surely claim I beat her. Instead I just take the beatings, they’ll heal – a legal mess trying to prove I was defending myself isn’t worth it.


Incident brief:  *I* called the police (not my ex) to get myself and my things from my ex-wife’s house when she got home and became physical.  She told the police my car was hers and had the officers take my car keys and gave them to her.  I was prepared for this possibility so I had the actual title in my hand showing it was my car. I had the divorce papers showing I bought the car after the divorce.  I tried desperately to explain it (calmly) was my car and they refused to listen


I was perfectly respectful to the police at the scene never raising my voice – it is all on video.  I have recorded all my conversations since with the police, the threatening officer being out of control, the commander saying they shouldn’t have taken my keys, the fact they don’t want their numbers skewed.  All recorded.


The officer that was yelling at me and taking my things had turned off his video equipment.  He also failed to upload his video at the end of his shift.  He was written up for those two violations and his rough treatment for a total of three permanent personnel marks (not that this helps me in anyway). Luckily two other officers at the scene didn’t try to cover up their actions so their equipment recorded it
Initially the police said it was a civil issue.  If this was the case, and is criminal, why can I not file a report or charges?


As of yesterday


The commander suggested I repo the car (like many of you might suggest).  However, if I could even find the car in the first place, would likely damage the car greatly and cost thousands (just re-keying that car will be over $1,000).  


Background:  My wife and I divorced (she cheated with my best friend and subsequently two other guys).  My ex fell on some hard times so I agreed to move in and help her with some finances for a few weeks.    The car was purchased *after*divorce.  I paid cash for the car after divorce so I have the title
I had two cars at the house


I don’t want to wait and spend thousands of dollars to get a car I already own.  I want justice done


I’m at a loss.  What do I do?  Sue the city?  Call the local news?

1337503255.0,tvszi,Kind of urgent. I don't know who to ask or what to even search for to narrow it down.,YouEssay,10,1,25,"So here is the scoop. My girlfriend had a person message her on Facebook about a year ago with photos of her that were obviously Photoshopped to make it seem as if she had cum all over her face. I informed the person that what they were doing could be considered slander and legal action could be taken against him if he was discovered. After that he stopped.

But now, fuckbook.com. He gave her a link on it revealed a full profile with her name, last name spelled slightly wrong, the city she lives in, and a couple pictures. The pictures include the photoshopped photo sent before and a couple other ""subjective"" ones that could be considered sexual. One is of us in our friends hotel room in Vegas, her face is in front of my crotch suggesting she's giving me head while she is not, others include her with her friend on a bed in the same room

So we realized the profile has been up for a year, I love big dicks but am also bi"" etc etc. She also has captions on her photos such as ""his cock was big and yummy"" and there is even a photo of a dog sitting on her from a family get together that says "" i love dogs tongues, they're so long.""

So i am familiar with slander, my girlfriends, and her friends' images. Is there anything that can be done, is this even illegal? No permission was given for these photos to be portrayed that way and I have no idea what to do.

Sorry for any typos

I live in the U.S.

[EDIT 2] My girlfriend is currently 21 years old but one picture on the website is from when she was 15 years old.

**UPDATE:** 

So, similar, but the cum is slightly different on another website, imagefap.com This time though, the user who posted it is our culprit and he has multiple pictures of other girls from her High School with fake cum on them as well. With captions like, ""this girl is such a slut, have a good fap."" 

I promise you this is not some huge epidemic where these girls are whores, others at home, and they are manipulated to make it seem as if they are in fact sluts. Some use their real names, no full last names, just first name and last initial.

She is notifying all of the girls but I made sure to tell them to keep it under wraps until we speak to a lawyer which is what we'll be doing.

Thanks for the help guys

**UPDATE 2:**

 So my girlfriend decided to do a little investigative research while I reviewed the legal aspect of our case. As I mentioned, we'll say John. So my girlfriend began reveiwing John's friend list on Facebook and she found exact matches to an entire album of girls which have the caption, ""Sluts I met in College.""

So she cross-referenced every girl in that album, and they all do in fact go to his college, **AN ART COLLEGE**

I had not realized first thing that he went to an art college until someone pointed it out. This would explain the photoshopped images.

So we BELIEVE we have narrowed it down to whom it may be, we'll call him Joe, is best friends with this John character. He uses the mother's name. In my opinion, you have to be pretty close to someone to know their mother's name. 

Then she did more research. 

Turns out, our friend John has his own profile complete with cock photos and a list of his turn ons. 

So either this is the kid doing it

I used a credit card issued by a major bank in USA (one of the too big to fail banks) to purchase both the tickets. My onward journey (Detroit- India) was fine. While returning back the agent issuing the boarding pass asked me for the credit card I had purchased the ticket with. Unfortunately the bank had closed my credit card and issued me a new credit card on the same account (but different card number) a month prior to my travel and was asked to destroy my old credit card. The agent was unable to print the boarding pass for my wife but was able to print the boarding pass for me. So I was forced to purchase a new ticket at the airport for my wife almost twice the cost of the original ticket.

My Mom died in Denton County

My Mom died in August of 2009 with no will. At the time of her death she was married to her third husband

Shortly after her death

I got the paperwork in the mail. It was obviously done by my step-dad on a do-it-yourself legal site. He listed my brother as a female and left off one of my Mom's ex-husband's. Anyway

I was surprised I had an inheritance at all. I assumed everything would go to her husband but was told because he was not our father he gets half of her assets and my brother and I split the other half. She told me he could live in the house but not sell it without my brother and I consenting to the sale. I didn't sign the paperwork and he had a baby fit and thus cut off all contact

My step-dad proved himself to be quite the scumbag by lying and trying to trick me and my brother into signing away whatever inheritance we had. How do I know there isn't anything else? I'm not really interested in getting anything but sentimental things

My questions are:

How do I settle the estate without paying a lawyer tons of money I don't have? I'm a stay-at-home Mom going to school full time and living with my Dad to save enough money to pay for my classes.

What can I file on my own without a lawyer?

How do I prove that my step-dad is a sneaky mofo who shouldn't be the person in charge of listing her assets?

Thanks for any help you can give me. I really just want her estate settled so when my step-dad dies I will have minimal contact with his crazy baby mama and however many ex-wives he'll have racked up by then.

About 2 weeks ago I began having issues with the car starting.  Took it to the dealership who identified a defective part that needs replacement.  The part is on ""national backorder"" and apparently no one knows when it will be back in stock.  The part is such that it needs to be programmed by the manufacturer with my VIN so secondhand parts are not an option (even if they were available, so this is obviously a problem that more people than just I am facing.

The issue seems to be worsening.  It has not reached the point where I would call the vehicle undriveable however it is quickly approaching that point.  I have contacted the car manufacturer however getting any sort of response is like pulling teeth.

At some point I have to assume that the manufacturer will be in violation of the warranty, months?  I depend on this vehicle to function in normal life.  I have already had to rent a car for a weekend out of my own pocket due to the issue (dealership does not offer courtesy cars, manufacturer has not offered any sort of rental/reimbursement).

I work for a huge and powerful retail corporation (One the top 15 biggest in the USA) that has it's own charge card. Our managers have quotas they need to meet so they stress that we should 'do anything' to make that charge card sale. The incentive for the customer to sign up is a percentage off of their purchase. 

It is against company policy to offer the discount if they are not approved for the card. 

One of my co-workers (who was one of top in sales) has just gotten fired for offering that discount even if they were not approved

Well

If I were to quit now, but I considered them friends and wanted to please them with lots of sales and since they said we should do it, I figured they would override when we got in trouble for it. Now they're saving their asses and I don't have proof that they told me that, but they have proof of me discounting.

I'm planning on getting out of that company

1. Should I leave now? Or when I find another job. (I'm trying to avoid owing them that large chunk of money)

2. Do I /have/ to sign the agreement saying I'll compensate them for their losses?

I live in London

I'm looking for some swift advice regarding an unfair dismissal case my mother has opened against her employer. She's had one of her appeals dismissed tonight and is feeling a little stressed - so while we wait for our actual lawyers to provide feedback to her case I thought I'd see if any of you might have any words of wisdom that might help her relax. She is facing this dismissal as a result of redundancies being made in her department.

Her case against the employer is built upon two main points:

 - Firstly, which failed to reflect both the role she actually fulfilled and failed to reflect the guidelines she was placed in her role to achieve by those in charge of the description.

    This has lead to the situation whereupon she is facing redundancy for a role that she did not really fulfil anyway.

 - Secondly, stating that if she chose to take voluntary redundancy they were ""prepared to be very generous"". This talk was cited as being ""off the record"", and took place shortly after the interview for her old position had finished.

      This is indicative of the sort of atmosphere that she feels the employer created to show that they had no intention of ever offering the position in the first place.

The employer's response has been to make the offer of applying for a junior role for which she'd be contending with an associate who used to work for her.

Really quick version of something that has been dragging on for 3 years. I an provide a longer version if people want. 

Background:

3 Years ago, and a big company was granted a temporary injunction against the product. I had already sold almost all the stock - so it was in my best interest to fight the injunction (I emailed the company asking for a refund, they said no, they are in China, no real recourse to get the money back). 

1 of the guys recommended a small firm that we had used before. 

We rang them,000!! We said no way, and where ready to ring around. 
The owner of the firm said something a long the lines of 'The case shouldnt go anywhere near that
The court date was in a week
I deposited HALF as I felt bad  and had a bigger share of products coming in. The other 2 did around 25% each. 

The case:

It was a bit of a joke, and we had a good chance of getting it removed. We knew that if we did though, they company would then probably take us to court and drag it out. 

The firm we hired made a decent amount of mistakes with the papers they submitted to court

10 minutes before the case
I asked the QC and our legal team what would happen if they decided they didn't want the stock --- they said that if they agreed to it
We agreed
3 or so days later we got a response from the Multinatinal company that they would NOT be paying for the stock...some of the reasons where that 1 of reasons given was that the contract that out firm wrote up did not stipulate the amount of devices they would be paying for (an error on there part)
This means that we could not import the stock, etc...


After the case:

I emailed the firm and asked them to stop representing us. 
They sent a final bill for around $60
I asked them why it was over $50, and the more time then was thought was billed...
I had a look back at the contract I signed to see that the amount listed on the contract was 10
The firm had not indicated to me via phone/email that the balance had gone over $50
I then found out that 1 of the other companies had NOT signed the agreement
The other company was the one that recommended these guys
So they have been chasing me for around $13
Sending me debt collector notices...emailing me to settle for $8000 etc. 
I had already paid more than 1/3 of the total bill (25



Now:

Mid this month I received a summons to appear in court  in order for them to collect the $13,000......They also listed me as a guarantor PERSONALLY for the money. Which I signed. 
I never read the document


So what do I do?

My first idea (after watching Suits) was to call them and ask them if they are proud of the way they represented me, and they would probably lose more than $13k in future customers. 
I have already told this friend about the case a while ago - and he already has half of the website ready

Is it worth calling them and proposing that to them? Send me an invoice for $0 or I give my friend the rest of the details?

 I don't think it would be illegal as it is not defamation if the information is true...I don't know if it falls under any other laws that I could get into trouble for.

The court date is in 1.5 weeks!

Thanks

My landlord said she needed to wait for the new renters to arrive before she could properly assess the damage and give us back our security deposit. She said she would have the deposit and an itemized list of deductions by the second week of July. Well

After 62 days we emailed again and she informed us that she is taking so long because she is waiting for the window repair man to come and evaluate the break. She said she found it two weeks after we moved out

On day 66 she stated

My roommates and I are furious, old class mates, and they stated they didn't receive deposits until about 90 days after they moved out! Meaning she did not return the money until after all her summer renters left. This makes me feel uncomfortable as it muddles up what is our damage and what is damage caused over the summer. 

If it was just me I wouldn't care but one of my roommates is moving to Canada for graduate school and needs to financially plan accordingly. 

Edit: Didn't ask a clear question: Is the landlord wrong in keeping our deposit so long? 

Edit: My roommates and I are three quiet and responsible women. We kept the house in good working order and scrubbed the house top to bottom when we left.

I hired an electrical contractor to do some work at my house. He was recommended by someone (job unfinished

He gave me a quote and called me a few days later to confirm an appointment. Asked me for a 50% deposit when he came to take measurements. I've found that it's perfectly normal to do this so I obliged. 

Since then he's missed two dates to do the work

100% sure he's a con artist. He's stopped calling the person who's house he was working on and I've since found reports of his practices online all over.

1374328779.0,1ip0fu,[Wisconsin] Confused on my legal rights as an employee,wipooremptreat,12,1,5,"I just have a couple rapid fire questions. I've tried to do my own research a bit and sometimes I feel there are grey areas or words that have wide definitions.

1: I was told in the interview and also after I had been hired and signed some papers that I would get a $0.25 raise for every position I learned completely through training. Of the 4 positions I can fully work 3

2: I know in the state of Wisconsin it now states in law that no employee above the age of 18 is required to be given a break

3: There is no posting of any employee rights posters in a general employee back/break room. I believe it's called OSHA. I was told that is illegal by a friend and also a neighbor.

4: I went to a supervisor and brought up some issues I feel need to be resolved and that I couldn't take it to the general manager because he was part of the problem. He promised me he'd give me the owners phone number so that I could bring it up to him. Instead he back stabbed me (My fault for trusting him I guess) If I get terminated/fired for voicing my opinion on issues is that legal grounds for termination or does that fall under wrongful termination due to ""retaliation"" style firing? I know WI like many other states is work at will or what ever it's called so I feel little to no protection as a worker.

5: I was told maybe a month ago that since we're a work at will state that I can be fired for no reason and can't fight it because I CHOOSE to work. They also mentioned that we all signed agreement contracts to that. Now I know for a fact the only thing I signed was a small package of maybe 5 papers and it's still in my gmail inbox and NONE of them are contracts about working. Anything I can do if I do get fired?

6: If I do get fired is it within my legal rights to ask for a written reason for my termination that both of us must sign? Meaning I'd have it written up like reason for termination: ""Wasn't working out""


Okay that was as clear as I could make it. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask I will try to answer them. Also thanks ahead of time for any insight into my issues. If you care about some more back story I'll just state I make BARELY above my states minimum wage and like I said I'm never given any breaks and I feel there is a lot of bullying and scare tactics used by the owner and the general manager. They're the type that think I should lick their boots clean to thank them for ALLOWING me to work. I know work place politics happen everywhere and I'm not the type to complain. I'm the type that doesn't back down to bullying of workers. I think it's sickening that workers don't have any rights anymore and that we're going backwards. If you follow anything about the state of Wisconsin our lovely governor Scott Walker is a union buster. In my opinion EVERY worker in the world should be able to FIGHT for their right to bargain about the job and they should be protected from bullying and wrongful termination by employers.

I'm in Detroit (area)

Questions

(posted at top for visibility but you may wanna read these afterward)

* Can they legally call those numbers after I told them not to?

* Can the person they were trying to speak to tell them not to call and will calling be illegal for them if they call after being told not to? (If my simply telling them not to isn't enough - as a resident of the same house)

* Does it sound like they're going to call? (note in particular the italicized text at the bottom of the post)

I am living in a house with 3 other people. Two are old

* Story name for older man: Ted
* Story name for older woman: Edna

* My name: Pinky
* Ex name: Brain

Someone called for Ted. I tried to answer on the phone with caller ID

 I am not related to Ted nor anyone living here. They said they were calling about medical issues

I hung up and about 5 minutes later it hit me that it may not have been the hospital. I went upstairs and checked the spare phone hidden in the back room which was charged and it was that dang 866 ""medical company"" or whatever. I called back and got the same woman who had just called (pretty sure

I called back a 2nd time and spoke to another woman whom gave me the same ""we can't help you without knowing your name and relation"". I told her I was just the person Emily talked to and wanted them to remove the cellphone numbers from their system that I just shared with Emily. This woman said it wasn't in their system so I shouldn't worry and she hung up after I squeeked out a pathetic ""okay"". 

So

Blah blah

&gt; Me: Can I have your company name or what sort of company you are? I don't want you calling them on vacation. (note: I never asked for any on previous calls. Her reply was to THIS statement)

&gt; Supervisor: WHY are you asking for personal health information about Ted?

&gt; Me: I'm not

&gt; Supervisor: What's your name ma'am?

&gt; Me: It's irrelevant. I just want you to not call the numbers I gave thinking you were the hospital. 

&gt; Supervisor: I can't help you if you won't tell me your name. Why is it some military-guarded secret?

&gt; Me: I don't want you calling telling them I told you it was okay to call them.

&gt; Supervisor: (she pauses)

&gt; Me: Can I at least know what kind of company you are?

&gt; Supervisor: You can't ask for personal medical information regarding Ted. 

&gt; Me: this has nothing to do with Ted. I don't want you to share any medical information whatsoever. I don't even need to know what your business is. I just want you to not call.

&gt; And she interrupted me as I was saying ""I just want you to not call"" because she knew it was coming.

&gt; Supervisor: I don't think you should call again. I'm ending this call. 

&gt; Me: Just never call (phone hangs up)


--- I reworded this post because it was confusing and I'm not sure if I could have made it shorter AND informative.

*They never said they won't call but the 3rd woman (before I spoke to the supervisor) said to have Ted call when he gets back

This is stressing me out and I'm shaking and light-headed. I don't want to ruin their vacation.

Three years ago, and this person continued to live there after our agreement was up.  Since the sublessee paid me the equivalent of my security deposit upfront, I considered my responsibilities terminated at the time the lease was terminated.

In the past two years, the occupants at the time ceased paying rent.

We (the co-signers of the original lease) recently received a letter that we're being held responsible for the rent that was unpaid between March and July

1. The husband is refusing to pay any of the costs associated with the marital home after this month ends because he has to pay the fees on the new home. Can he do that? Their home is marital property and he is on the mortgage.

As of this morning I got a certified letter saying I had 72 hours to remove my Torino as it was a derelict vehicle. Called the police department again and said the Torino was tagged and it was still running and driving.

He said because I had chocked the tires and it had a blanket thrown over it it was still derelict and it didn't matter that it was legally tagged and running.

I told him (which he should have known) that the blanket was on the car due to the recent hail storms we've been having here in OK

My partner mentioned he would be moving soon and we should both move to a new area and start this business together so I packed up and moved to California in July of 2009 using all of the funds from the sale of my money making website ( ~20K ) and we moved to the same apartment complex. The prices were a shock ( $1400/month for a 1bd room) for me and soon I realized that we would need to get this site off the ground. My partner put forth the funds to purchase the initial domains ( ~9K ) and the equipment ( ~1K on vaporizers and a ~1k camera for himself ) and I was responsible for the sites themselves. I have a background in graphic design

 As the months went by traffic to our sites began to grow and we actually started getting orders to the point of a sustainable business

Traffic continued to grow through the months and the site was now making thousands of dollars

I wont go too far into this part but in the end she was paid the same amount as me per month for six months or so until it got to the point that she really wasn't fulfilling her roll at all and had pretty much taken a back seat just getting a check every month. I could feel the tension growing in the house so I took what money I had and moved out

Naively I believed that my partner was just protecting his own interest's in case I ever tried to screw him out of the company as he was really not even involved at this point and accepted this action. We had the contracts signed the LLC was registered in my name - I couldn't have my own company taken from me could I ? The next few months my communication with my partner fell to an all time low

I have spent the last year of my life struggling along trying to deal with the loss of my dream and feeling sorry for myself. A month ago I was looking for an email in my spam folder and came across a domain that looked familure - after some quick research I quickly realized my partner was now using our domains to spam vaporizer emails out. I started checking the sites and to my surprise everything was still there exactly as I had left it

I am now sitting here

I had a bad abscess in my mouth. I went to the local hospital

I only have medicare Part A

Despite this

This was not the case,790 (over 88% of my annual SocSec Disability income) bill for the procedure. What ticks me off the most is that nothing was discussed with me up front. The procedure was not life-threatening, and could have been postponed (albeit painfully) so that I could have gotten proper insurance, or removed only the bottom row since they were the only teeth causing abscesses (which would have at least halfed the bill).

I am wondering if (and how) I can be legally responsible for this when I was not made aware up front that this would be an out-of-pocket expense.

1369175781.0,1esmk8,"Neighbors have a dangerous dog and are reckless, start harassing us, landlord refuses to do anything.",seriouslypissedoff,9,10, this is getting out of hand. Sorry if this reads kinda long.

Neighbors have a pitbull that has been terrorizing us for over a year now, and share a giant yard that encompasses the property, and also a big parking area. This dog has attacked our dog multiple times as well as the other neighbors dogs 15-20 feet across the way in front of us (they live in identical housing as us, so we're two houses in parallel.) And it even tried attacking me and the person I live with. We've called the landlord, says she will tell them to leave, but follows it up with ""being afraid of them trashing the place after they move out."" So nothing has been done ever since. 

After we tried to talk to the landlord, bellowing that she has taken care of the situation by ""disciplining the dog by kicking it,"" and that we didn't need to bring the landlord into this. It was all ridiculous. She then broke down and started crying, calling the landlord on her phone, and accused us of being racists, said we called her a ""nigger lover,"" and conspiring against her (which made me beyond angry.) She can't control this dog and in my eyes she isn't fit to own it. They let their small kids walk this dog and they can't control it when it gets wild and tries to attack one of us (which has happened.) It runs outside loose almost everyday and bangs against our door barking, which makes it almost impossible to leave the house during the day.

Now it's getting petty, you know what chocolate does to it.) And just yesterday/today in the middle of the night, moved our garbage cans before the garbage truck came to pick them up, then moved them back out front in the morning while we slept. 

This is all childish, and I don't want to be driven out after only being here for 3 years, and especially when I've done nothing wrong. 

Is there something I can do that could put a stop to this? The police won't do anything about it.

So Reddit, plus demanding almost $10,000 in rent when I'm not living there (and he has new tenants already) seems crazy to me. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?

- All guests had left by 3AM except for a girlfriend of mine, and three other friends who were all asleep in different rooms.

- Around 3-3:30 AM, to get out of the bathroom, and leave the apartment with them. They were clearly hammered. I remember they had a whole water bottle of liquor (classy...) that they had been sipping on all night.

- E was still preoccupied with my girlfriend in the bathroom and C + G were only screaming louder. I heard them storm out of my apartment into the outer hallway

- The screaming in the hallway continued, the floor was ripped up, and a few tenants' bikes had been thrown around.

- The next day, who approached me about it, that I knew who did it and he would be held responsible. I confessed to knowing because I was afraid that if I didn't, I would not be invited to re-sign my lease. It didn't even occur to me to file a police report at the time. I've never been in a position like this before, because none of my friends are belligerent fucks.

- The bill just came in for repairs to all the damage - $1, so there's some sort of report of this, and am sure I'll have to take this to small claims court in Boston, where I live. They will deny this in court, for sure, and I'm afraid I'll end up with the bill. I'm a grad student and work 2 full time jobs. It kills me to know I'll be set back financially if I have to pay this bill. It also kills me that I have to clean up these scumbags' mess.

Potential evidence that I have: photos of the damage after it was done, text messages from E saying C and G are going to have to find a way to pay, and could possibly get security camera footage of them leaving my place (but not actually doing the damage, because the camera is outside).

I don't think E would come to court. Is he obligated to? I've never been in this position and am not entirely sure what to do...

Anyways I bought the car trying to do dealer finance which was dumb I know. Believe me Ive really learned a lot this in the last month.

So here is whats going on first I got pulled over for expired tags on May 10th for which I never received my tags (expired 5/3) was given a $103 citation. I then went to the DMV which they told me my tags were purchased on April 29th and to go to the dealer or pay $45. I went to the dealer and talked to a finance guy who assured me everything was ok and that my citation would be taken care of. I was given a piece of paper without a new temp tag and was told to wait by the mail and it should be there and if I get pulled over show them that piece of paper. I get a call today 5/15 from my actual finance manager leaving me a message telling me the bank fell through and that I need to come back in and resign with another bank that gave me a better rate. All this when I was suppose to pay my first car payment on 5/18. Following that I get a call from my sales guy who also left me a message. I then later on gave my finance manager a call telling him I was out of town and that I would like the paper work sent over so I can take a look; which he wouldn't do. He then preceded to flip out on me telling me he should have ""trucked the car"" and that I should be grateful. I told him I was upset about the other finance manager not giving me another temp tag because I got pulled over again on mothers day with my mother in the car and I had to sit there for over an hour before they let me go. He then said he didn't know and that I wouldn't receive my tags in till I sign this new deal. I have been upfront and honest with them and I feel Im getting screwed somewhere. I also fell like they are trying to bully me. I work a lot and also go to school I have really no free time to deal with this which also pisses me off.

Now for questions: How much weight do I have here? What are my best options?
Im already pretty pissed could I demand my older car(or down payment) and return keys? Even if they do give me a better finance deal?

I guess what I'm worried about now is legal action. The client has proven himself to be a little hotheaded and I worry that he will threaten legal action. He has a fair amount of money and I am worried that I will have to deal with the possibility of legal action.
