The local animal shelter and my clinic [I work at a veterinary hospital in Texas] have an agreement so that the pets that are picked up off the streets and puppies that are surrendered to them can get treated for illnesses/injuries. 

Beethoven was dropped off at my clinic yesterday for vomiting and diarrhea. We ran a few tests and it turns out... 


Beethoven has Parvo

We received a call from the family that was in the process of adopting him and we informed them of his diagnosis. Turns out they didn't have the money to pay for the treatment. They called the shelter and surrendered their claim on him.
The next call we received broke everyone's heart.

It was the shelter. They had just opened a new facility that same day and did not have the funds to treat him


I've been in this industry for two and a half years. I've never really had the chance to make a difference in a lot of pets lives

Something about a starfish and the ocean. I'm sure someone knows the story.

I called my husband and began bawling on the phone. At four months old, told me to bring him home and we would treat him. 

Ten calls later

I've had dogs in the past with family and such but this is the first time I've taken on the responsibility of my own little one and I'm super excited but after talking to some neighbors they have me anxious. 
I will not be getting her till she is 8 weeks and have her first set of shots and I plan on making the appointment that day for her second shots... But my question is how careful do I need to be about her interacting with other dogs because of Parvo and such? There are lots of dogs in my complex (Which have to show PROOF of vaccinations) but do I need to keep her locked up in the house for the first month I have her?

No dogs have ever had it here (and the people here I've talked to have never seen it here either) and as I mentioned all dogs must have their shots up to date but I want to share her with my best friend who lives here and has a dog as well. Obviously I'm not going to a dog park and such but will visiting another dog or two be safe for her after her first shots But before her second set at 12 weeks?",self,t5_2qm5g,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/puppies/comments/10joln/first_time_puppy_owner_has_a_question/
