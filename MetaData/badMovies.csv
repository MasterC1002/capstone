1) Lots of boobs.  Gender and sexuality aside

2) Lots of [violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQT4VkjHF4).  So many asses are kicked in this movie.

3) [Patrick Swayze](http://whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/patrick_swayze_94538o.jpg) is a fucking God.

4) [Sam Elliott](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8lb1ypjuT1qfbtx3o1_500.jpg) is also a fucking God

5) [The stars of Road House sport unbelievable hairdos](http://imgur.com/taMZUYf)

6)  [A greased up shirtless Swayze does tai-chi by a river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_Ph1-A6Q8)

7) The Plot is fucking insane: Swayze's character, MO.  Dalton accepts almost immediately and proceeds to drive to Missouri where he turns town upside-down by simply improving a shitty bar.  This starts a war with a crazy business mogul who owns the town.  Madness ensues.

8) [You get to see Swayze fuck Kelly Lynch to an Otis Redding song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw4-qjENzZQ)

9) Swayze [rips a guy's throat out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlnBvrV8IW4)

10) Swayze can [rally the motherfucking troops.]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTh5JzRziHE)  What a smooth operator.

A few days ago I made [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/1jaqbb/would_anyone_be_willing_to_contribute_to_a_bad/) about an idea I had for a new magazine dedicated to the bad movies that this subreddit loves so much. I got an extremely positive reaction and a flurry of PMs from people excited about writing for the magazine.

Long story short

I wanted to go into detail a bit more about the magazine. First off

Anything published in the magazine will be owned by the writer

So

I’ve got a few ideas for topics already. Some of these are mine and some are from the previous thread on the topic.

Even if you can’t write and you just want to help out

Please help spread the word. If you know of any other subreddits that might enjoy this type of magazine

*****

**UPDATE:** A few people have asked about frequency of issues, which would give me a month to put it together. Hopefully we can get into the App Store by then. That would probably mean a deadline of three weeks from now for articles.

*****

**UPDATE 2: Electric Boogaloo (8/2):** I've decided to use Type Engine for the app. I'm currently testing and customizing the app and preloading a few articles I've written into it ([here's a sneak peak!](http://i.imgur.com/qYrHg2W.png)).

At the moment

Thanks again for the enormous response!

*****

**UPDATE 3: Update with a Vengeance (8/5):** Currently, I'm looking for content for the second issue. Drop me a message and we can work out the details!

THINGS TO NOTE:  
- SurveyMonkey only lets you collect 100 results and there were 177. Totally lame but whatever

The first thing that we wanted to know was the **gender**ical make-up of the subreddit. [Bit of a sausage fest, of course. See if we get all this personal stuff we can later blackmail you, of course. The make up is as one might expect, with [74% of us between 18 and 34](http://i.imgur.com/poDiZaP.png).

Question 3 was asking you **where you lived**. Top 3 are [US, as I expected most users to be from (and I was right cause I have a PhD in Ass Vortexes) then you have the unbridled privilege of telling us **which state** you're in. Top 3 were [California, Pennsylvania and Washington](http://i.imgur.com/ueHUnJo.png).

Finally, like, a job and shit. Turns out you lot aren't completely useless and a lot you actually [do work](http://i.imgur.com/6aSXB3B.png). That's cool. Only 11% unemployment rate, but if we combine that with student then we're up to 41% ~feral savages~ dependents.

**NOW THE ONLY THING YOU ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT: As a community

There were hundreds of options on the list and we let people people pick as many options as they wished so percentages are pointless here. This is cold

1. [Literally ~~hitler~~ every single result](http://i.imgur.com/hKJ3SaH.png)
2. [Less screen rapingly top 20](http://i.imgur.com/mPetYkn.png)

Option 2 is better to see for sure. Let's ~~analyze~~ analyse our top 20:

For anyone unable to view Imgur at work - ~~get the fuck off reddit or you'll be fired~~ here is the top 20:

1. The Room (49 votes)
2. Troll 2 (48)
3. Birdemic (35)
4. Killer Klowns from Outer Space (33)
5. Manos: Hands of Fate (30)
6. Plan 9 from Outer Space (28)
7. The Wicker Man 2006 (26)
8. Leprechaun: In The Hood (21)
9. Mega Shark VS Giant Octopus (19)
10. Samurai Cop (18)
11. Sharktopus (18)
12. The Happening (18)
13. Hard Ticket to Hawaii (17)
14. The Stuff (17)
15. Jack Frost (16)
16. Pink Flamingos (16)
17. Zardoz (15)
18. Silent Night
19. Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter (13)
20. Thankskilling (13)

The Room was the most popular with 49. That's every other user selecting it. A close second was Troll 2 with 48, but what the hey.

I saw it on netflix and when I read the description I knew I had to watch it. It's about that Hitler established a moon base during 1945 as a contingency plan, but something far genuinely better. 

This movie is  somehow a fantastic satire of modern American and even indeed world governments

 I think one of things that makes this movie works is that it understands how work with good satire. Like the movie Airplane much of the comedy works and is funny because it is people in ridiculous situations

It also has a surprising number of well down references to The Great Dictator, and Dr Strangelove. In fact not only are there references to Dr Strangelove, the entire movie is simply oozing with similar tone, satire, and cinematography as Dr Strangelove. If I was being completely honest, the best way I could describe this movie is that this is the  Dr Strangelove for our modern culture. 

However, many over the top ridiculous parts of a good ""so bad it's good b-movie"". Two words: Space Zeplins. Oh yea. Basically, if you have netflix consider watching this because it has all the greatness and sheer awesomeness of a bad movie, without actually being a bad movie. 

TLDR: Movie about space Nazi's is just as ridiculously awesome as it sounds

Picture included.,ShetlandJames,34,6,7,"So in May the Birdemic 2 cast and crew came over to Europe for a few movie premiers in England and France. I live in London where there was a screening. Unfortunately I was unable to attend the screening; I had a friend visiting me from New Zealand who was only going to be in London for the night and I hadn't seen her in about 8 months and didn't want to sit in a cinema - I wanted to talk to her!

Anyway I emailed Jeff Gross, some of you may not know this but I happen to work in the [UK Parliament](http://www.jonathanedwards.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/westminster-b.jpg) which is pretty rad. I collected them from Stratford and took them to Westminster for their tour.

I was wearing my NILBOG tshirt when I went to go see them. It turned out that James couldn't make it but Jeff said that was fortunate because he hates the association of Birdemic with Troll 2 and The Room. I would reckon that nearly every user on here considers Birdemic to be up there with Troll 2 and The Room as the greatest bad movie ever. James doesn't. James legitimately thinks that he made a good movie. 

Anyway

So I took them for a tour of my work and had lunch with them. Speaking to Alan was a surreal experience. Here was a guy who delivered one of my favourite performances ever in a movie but not for the same reason that I want to speak to William Fichtner. It took me about an hour and half to get into the whole “so… you do realise why people like this movie

Alan said that when the reviews and user comments first hit

We got some photos together on the roof and I got a whole bunch of signed shit – some of which I still have to give away. Can anyone think of a competition worthy of someone getting some signed Birdemic stuff?

[Here is the picture]( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/461318_10201087380007857_149365203_o.jpg) that we got on the roof. I’m 6”1½ FYI. I found it fucking fantastic that if you look closely you’ll see a bird flying over Alan’s head – complete accident.

* [Maniac Cop] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095583) - [Trailer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLOCUoz2NI)

Maniac Cop was almost too good of a movie to be labeled a ""bad movie"".  With all of its fantastic stunts and a proper story line I might have been wrong to include this on the list of for FUMN.  If Bruce hadn't been there to ham things up like only he can I wouldn't had even considered it.  Oh and the close ups on Robert Z'Dar's face were fantastic.

* [The Miami Connection] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092549) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpZu69OB2KM)

Everything you've heard about this movie is true.  Such a fun bad movie to watch.  Senseless dialog.  Fake guitar playing.  Over acting. Shirtless men.  The highlight of the night.   

* [Chatterbox] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075830) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2icTd46vcs)

I showed the trailer for this during another FUMN because I thought the premise was quite silly.  The wife liked the trailer and wanted to see the whole movie.  It wasn't too bad in a cutesy sort of way.  

* [Society] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098354) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDHzfyiZE_A)

A bit of a slow burner.  But once it draws you in and you start realizing that something is just a little off the ending smacks you right square in the face and you're left standing there wondering why your pants are around your ankles and your ass hurts.  

* [Viva] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393956) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWXwfeCpEv4)

Unfortunately we did not make it to this movie as it was getting a little late in the night.  But I've screened this movie a little bit and what I saw I really like.

I've been watching bad/horrible movies as long as I can remember and I've up until recently only had the pleasure of watching them alone.  My wife doesn't appreciate my tastes in movies but I've met some friends that do.  

What a fantastic night.  We just had our second Fucked Up Movie Night last night.  Our first week were these gems:

* [The Final Sanction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101876) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmBADBTVNoI) 

* [Someones Knocking at the Door](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1303902) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Ltdi0Bnu8)
 
* [Joysticks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085764) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuL1vOuxas)

* [Undead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339840/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8J-xyS4H0)

These were last night's selection:

* [Samurai Cop](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130236) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTd2BZggats)

* [Can I do it Till I Need Glasses] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075801) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhE9jJeTnX0)

* [Beneath the Valley of the Ultra Vixens] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078846) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo2iBbFGja4)

* [Safety First: Rise of the Women](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235442) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVswAcJXcEM)

Before each movie I have trailers and other various bits of internet detritus I run across each day.  Without a doubt the biggest hit each night are the unintentionally hilarious movies.

Week 1: Plan 9 From Outer Space
: 

If somebody was murdered

Personal thoughts: Poorest quality of any movie I have ever seen. Not the funniest

Week 2: Shark Attack 3: Megalodon

The only thing you need in a first aid kit is a flare gun.

Personal thoughts: Personal favorite of all time. Everything about this movie went wrong in the best way possible. Plus, and who doesn't like spontaneous softcore porn. After watching this for the 2nd time I decided to find the DVD on Amazon, worth the $16 to watch is whenever I want. 10/10


Week 3: Dungeons &amp; Dragons:

There is no better tribute to your best friend’s death than a pile of rocks.

Personal thoughts: Huge budget for an awful movie. The SFX were great

Week 4: The Room

If you buy somebody things

While everybody else likes this one I personally don't enjoy Tommy Wiseau, and the unfinished plot line are abundant. 9/10

Week 5: Troll 2

Fire extinguishers cause confusion.

Personal thoughts: Not a whole lot to say

Week 6: Black Dynamite: 

Donuts don’t wear alligator shoes.

Not technically a bad movie, and a perfect copy of the blacksploitation films of the past, complete with intentional goof and overtly racist characters and writing. 7.5/10


Week 7: The House that Bleeds on Alex / Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter


There is no such thing as a shit house (and/or office).
Atheists can compact five times better than actual people.

Personal thoughts (The House that Bleeds on Alex):  Bad on purpose, if you haven't seen it the Tommy Wi-Show shorts is worth a look, but not his best work) 8/10 for The House that Bleeds on Alex and 6.5/10 for the Tommy Wi-Show




Week 8: Robot Jox: 

Russians curdle beer.

Definitely worth seeing

Movies from outside of the club:

Sharktopus
7/10

Mega Piranha
5/10

Behemoth
3.5/10

Ice Spiders 
6/10

Sabertooth
6.5/100

Lake Placid 3
7/10

Lake Placid 2
7.5/10

Mega Snake
8/10

Rise of the Gargoyles 
7.5/10

Vipers
7/10

Wyvren 
8/10

I've seen plenty of others over the years, Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy, and Raptor Island among others. 

#1 movie that isn't technically a bad movie

Dr. Strangelove

It has everything that makes a bad movie an bad movie worth watching. Ridiculous people acting seriously in a ridiculous situation which continues to get more and more ridiculous (my personal theory on what makes a bad movie). If you watch this you will end up dying of laughter at the end


I'll try to give more suggestions in the future if I can

Scale:

7.5&lt;: Definitely worth seeing.

7.5&gt; or = and &gt;5 worth seeing if you have plenty of free time

5&gt; Worth seeing if you have LOTS of free time.",self,t5_2rgwi,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/oyrvj/started_the_bad_movie_club_at_my_university_here/

Enter Cinemageddon.

Cinemageddon (CG) is a bittorrent tracker and haven for bad, most of which are active.  None of these are big budget or popular flicks.  They have strict rules forbidding mainstream movies, new releases, and movies that are widely available by other means.  For most of these films, this is the *only* place they can be found.  Many of the members there are serious enthusiasts that spend lots of time and money tracking down ancient tapes and foreign laserdiscs, just to spend even more time ripping, encoding and cleaning them up to make the best possible digital version of movies that looked like utter garbage even when new.  If you want the best of the worst

CG is a private tracker and invite only.  It may take some effort on your part to get in (and to maintain a good ratio once you do), they almost certainly have that too.  [Here's a screencap](http://i.imgur.com/pm8mP.png) of the most recent uploads, just to give you an idea.  The members are not exactly the friendly, fluffy sort.  Think of a cross between 4chan and a biker bar.  It is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but again, it's worth it.

Rural US, suffocating them. His son, (or the bf of his daughter or similar) was one of the few people who believed the crazy old dude, and sets about climbing the mountain to go kill the monster. 

Turns out the crazy old man was correct and the mountain turns into a monster with easily the best 'size':'money spent on CGI' ratio. I'm talking giant tentacles flailing everywhere

Not sure how many folks on BadMovies know about this little ring of vloggers and artists. Their reviews are like crack to me

Each person who produces videos, special, hollywood movie, Music Video, TV show episode/series, video game, or other piece of media, so ~20-27 minutes) in which they discuss the work in question and explain whether or not they think it's worth a watch. They'll normally start from the beginning of the movie and provide some history and context to the movie beforehand, and--most importantly--crack jokes (normally in the form of references to *good* movies via the insertion of short clips from relevant scenes in those moves)

What sets these reviewers aside from a lot of other forms of entertainment I've seen are two things:

First

Second, start appearing on ""the main site"", start generating ad revenue from the single skippable ad that appears before every video, and start making some money (a few of the reviewers actually do it full-time). This means that the reviews are honest and fair. There is very little bias when it comes to these guys and that's probably the thing I love the most about them. They look at all of these weird little atrophied nubs of our media culture and judge whether or not they should be cut off and forgotten or saved and remembered in all their misshapen glory (and sometimes they find some stuff that's really beautiful or heartbreaking buried in with all the crap). These guys really treat every movie with a careful critical eye. If it's good, they point it out and give credit where credit's due. If it's bad, they rip it to fucking shreds, light it on fire, dance hard techno

Please, they go through and cut out all the boring or uninteresting parts so you're left with ""just the good parts"". You get the experience of having watched the movie in the course of about 20 minutes, you have a good number of laughs along the way, and if the movie still sounds interesting, there's still about 3/4 of it that you haven't seen so it's still worth watching (since they often times don't point out *everything* fucked up or weird in a given movie because sometimes there's just so much and they can only shoehorn so many clips into a 20-minute review).

Here's a sample of some of the reviewers and an example of the kinds of thing they tend to review

- [Nostalgia Critic](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic) (mostly  80's and 90's TV shows and Movies you remember from your childhood if you're in your 20's or 30's, the Super Mario Bros. Movie, Secret of Nimh, etc.)
- [Nostalgia Chick](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick) (same as the Nostalgia Critic, Disney's Hercules, the Babysitter's Club, etc.)
- [TheSpoonyOne](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/spoonyone/reviews) (A lot of Fantasy, as well as modern Video Game movies. Examples include: Dead or Alive, Mazes &amp; Monsters, Highlander 2, Clones of Bruce Lee, etc.)
- [Film Brain](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/fbv/bmbe) (A British reviewer, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Arthur Christmas, etc.)
- [ObscurusLupa](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/ol/olp) (Does a lot of cheesy 70's and 80's horror flicks, ""Married with Fishsticks"" aka the worst episode of Xena ever, The Fly 2, etc.)
- [MikeJTV](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/mjtv/ss) (another British reviewer, Ace Ventura Jr., Megashark vs. Giant Octopus, etc.)

There are about a dozen more reviewers like this who review movies, D&amp;D products, TV, Pop songs, video games, and almost every kind of media under the sun, and even the one's I've listed review a lot of other things (SpoonyOne does a *ton* of old PC Roleplaying game reviews as well as old FMV game reviews, and there's a whole affiliated ring called ""Blistered Thumbs"" that's primarily for reviewing Video Games both retro and modern). Please

I'd recommend starting with the Nostalgia Critic's reviews. He's the Flagship reviewer for the site

I've seen test patterns with more entertainment value.

Obviously, or even remember their lines.  The sets consist of a basement storage area, several rooms in a residential home, and a parking lot.  At one point, what is obviously a 2nd floor bedroom (complete with ceiling fan) is purported to be a hospital.  The only indication of this is an MRI machine made of cardboard and butcher paper, and several medical-scan-looking printouts taped to the wall.

The plot is indecipherable, and then leaving.  There was no attempt made to edit the footage - obvious line flubs, people tripping over the ""set"", and the camera operator falling asleep and failing to follow the ""actors"" are all kept in the final cut.  The sound editing is even worse.  They couldn't be bothered to mic anybody, so the on-camera mic was used.  There are entire scenes where you cannot really hear the dialog, and other scenes where ambient noise drowns out what dialog you can hear.

Oh, but then it just gets stupid again.

This isn't the sort of movie you get drunk and laugh at.  It's the sort of movie you watch when you hate yourself and you're working up to suicide.  It's the sort of movie that convinces you that humanity is doomed and life is not worth living.  You have been warned.

SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

My reviews of the worst shit horror has to offer

This is a format I use for reviewing awful movies because

1) I am too lazy to write full

2) I forget details immediately after seeing them

3) My reactions as I watch the movie seem to be the funniest parts.

This is how I usually review movies, rewind, etc.

So here in a jumbled mess of words and nonsense is my review for the abysmal JURASSIC SHARK.

Enjoy.

---

1 min 10 sec intro explaining what a megalodon is.  

Two bimbos can't act for shit

Given terrible dialogue/manage to make characters even dumber with natural talent

Take clothes off down to bikinis and layout on beach 

Jim Wynorski movie?  Nope.  No silicone.

Glasses and white jackets = professionals

Hallways like a motel

Cliche bull dialogue from every Syfy movie

Totally stupid yknow?

Yknow yknow ynow?

Giant clipboard + glasses + white jacket = super professional 

Motel stairway dramatic scene

""You're drilling too deep.""

I wish this was a Wynorski movie

Stock sound fx + awful cg smoke = huuuuge explosion.

Totally yknow totally

Water fight.  5 year olds in sexy 20 year old bodies

THAT WATER FIGHT JUST LASTED EXACTLY 64 SECONDS.  HOLY FUCK.

09:38 - Title card.

Why the fuck do movies take so long to show the damn title anymore?

Opening credits = 2 min 22 seconds 

My god.

No shark no gore no nudity no luck

Meet the badguys.  Back story is told bc showing it would cost $20.

Black clothes = bad guys

She's a bitch.

Stole a painting.  Better be of a shark.  And it ages forever keeping the shark young.

More ""shark"" pov.

Water escape.  Smart.

From the pov the shark is apparently doing barrel rolls... CONSTANTLY.

Another attack.  No shark no blood no gore no point.

More bimbos in bikinis.  Two tan

Oh bad guys are on land now

Go in and fetch it.  Good plan.

So they saw a shark.  Take their word for it.

Oh that one guy did die.  They act like it's nothing.

Guy is walking right back into the lake.  Christ.

19:25 - Oh fuck.  Far away cg shot of a cardboard cutout.

I mean Shark.  

If that's a megalodon and suppose to be 52 feet long then fuck my eye sight.

Oh.

Bad guy in black stands in waist deep water.  Shark who is now possibly the size he should be jumps up

And the CG is what you'd expect from a SyFy original.  But worse.

What?  This isn't a SyFy original?

Oh fuck even they wouldn't... sink... this... forget it.

Did I mention the reactions from his teammates?  Oh that's bc there were none.

New bimbos on the lake now.

Chick with massive 80s curly hair has a man face.  I think it's Richard Simmons.

They keep using white flashes between ""shark footage.""

Oh Fuck it's doing barrel rolls again.

People flopping in water to stock music with constant flashes = seizure.

I mean shark attack.

How did they all get on land?

Random guy is dead bc he seemed half intelligent and that ruined the theme.

Bimbos see terrible leg prop.

""Is that Mike?""

Fuck.

Bimbos meet bad guys.

Oh god Richard Simmons face.  Ugh.

Same three shots of shark swimming around used over and over.

They're talking about nothing... forever.

Fade to black open on red filtered stock sunset fade to black open on red sky becoming blue WHITE FLASH.

Isn't this a killer shark movie?  With the play on words its not even a Jurassic Park ripoff which would be great.  They seriously have no budget no idea what they're doing making this up as they go and nothings happening nothings happening NOTHINGS HAPPENING HAPPENING HAPPENING FUCKING NOTHING WALKING WALKING WALKING WALKING---

...

WALKING WALKING WALKING WALKING WALKING.

5 hour walk on the beach is what they said.  Take shortcut to avoid the no shark.  They weren't kidding.  Feels like 5 hours.

THEY WALK FROM 29:25 UNTIL 31:55 WITH NO DIALOGUE AND NEVER STOP WALKING UNTIL 34:03.

ALMOST 5 MINUTES OF WALKING.

SHARK OF THE RINGS. 

They finally find a building and go ape shit like they've never seen their friends garage before.  I mean in real life that's what it looks like.

Fuck.

Bad guys whisper so low I can't even make it out.  Pretty sure they didn't know their lines.

Professional doctor janitor lies outside with blood on jacket.  Oh he's fine.

Shark cut off any means of escape.  HOW?

Bad guys force dr. Janitor to walk into water.  Being the smartest person here and an expert on the shark he complies and is eaten right away.  By eaten I mean terrible cg shark opens mouth at camera and nothing is seen.

Jesus christ.

So many Canadian accents.  Shudder.

Roid rage bad guy is going roid retard.

Slow motion run scene for 7 seconds.  White flash.  Stop say line.  WHITE FLASH.  Run slomo for 14 more seconds.  WHITE FLASH.  Slomo ""fight"" scene with Roidy.  I stopped caring.

Waist deep water shark attack 2.

CRUNCH.

Oh fuck.  We're only 43 mins in?

BTW everything was in slomo from 40:40 to 42:35.

Night time.  Talking talking talking.

Day.

Dynamite something about dynamite.

""Frying pan.  Fire.""

She smart is.

Shark having a blast in choppy water.

Roidy derp throws dynamite in water.  Shark does a perfect 180.  Don't think it even turned.  Its face and ass literally morphed into eachother.

50:25 - 51:00 epic slomo walking taking shirts off revealing bikinis they've worn the whole movie.  Nudity would save this piece of shark shit but no we don't even get that.

Girls walk into water.

Roid herp the derp throws another piece.

Possibly same exact shot.

Very small shark continues to swim around aimlessly.

Bitch with gun vs shape shifting shark?  Id rather get shot.

SAME DYNAMITE THROW SAME SHARK 180 SHOT.

Roidy threw stick too late and blew himself up.  Award winning fx.

Richard Simmons face gun vs bitch gun.

Bad guy who isn't dead gets eaten by shark.  By that I mean it chews violently at the camera with no body no blood no gore no give a fuck to the audience.

Okay.

Um.

I'm going to explain this.  Try.  To explain this.

Somehow seconds before this happens the two not dead bimbos apparently know it's about to happen.

Shark gets... running start and uh... jumps out of the water roaring like a lion... soars over the two bimbos in slomo just to kill the bitch with gun.  Why ignore the two bimbos and put all that effort to get the food furthest away?  Nevermind the HOW I want to know the WHY GOD DAMNIT.

If the shark was 52 feet and could do this it would have fallen on and killed EVERYBODY.

Did I mention the shot goes from the shark over the two bimbos to bitch looking up to the shark landing back in the water?

THE SHARK FLEW

ATE THE BITCH

THEN ROTATED OFFSCREEN IN THE AIR

AND LANDED BACK IN THE WATER.

The bitch is gone except her feet.

If we stay on land we'll be safe.

DID THEY NOT JUST SEE THAT

Her face gets uglier every shot.

Bimbo 1 goes into water bleeding to attract shark.  Bimbo 2 throws dynamite.  Shark eats it.  Blows up.  Bimbo 1 doesn't die.  They walk away.

Random family drinking by water.  Canadian accents grate my ears.

Shark roars like a lion horizontally across screen eating them.

The end.

Wait.

One hour.  Two minutes.  Twenty-two seconds.

The movie is only an hour long.

The end credits go at a snails pace making it 1 hour 15 minutes 18 seconds.

Take out the intro the opening and ending credits and even being generous by leaving the endless walking and slomo scenes in and this movie is only... 59 mins long.

50 mins minus walking and slomo.

Holy fuck.

Even the worst shit shark movies run at 90 mins approx. without that much padding.

I love terrible cg shark movies but this wasn't even that.  You see the shark in all its different shapes and sizes for less than 5 mins total out of the 59 min running time.  The rest is filler very few lines and those have no meaning.  No real plot no character development friends and family die and people shrug it off and fuck fuck Fuck FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK---
