My very first campaign was a complete disaster. I used 4th edition D&amp;D as a basis for my world because I had little experience with other systems. However, the world had guns. I homebrewed the weapon myself, making attack rolls based on the type of gun wielded and the damage based on bullets. For crits, you had to roll a d100 (based on body percentage area) to determine effects.

So, just like everyone else (pretty much same strength as a shortbow). And throughout the first two sessions of the campaign, he failed to hit even a single target with his bullets. So I figured he wasn't that much of a threat.

Then, but once he was first bloodied he would heal and summon a zombie hulk.

So, it is knocked away at the last second by the necromancer's familiar (who was on his shoulder). After that, some people attempt to chip away at some of the zombies and skeletons the boss summoned. Finally, the party's gunman gets his turn. He does a basic ranged attack.

Natural 20. He rolls to see where the bullet hit.

Boom. Headshot. Instant kill

I was so embarrassed about this,,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,True

Anyway, and had the intent to find a court wizard and several mages to serve under him to detect evil on all of the stuff. We had also called the nobles to the castle for a stern talking-to, or something to that effect.

Z: ""Gentlemen. I imagine you're wondering why I have gathered you here. It's unfortunate that I forgot...""

Steve: ""Wait

Z: ""That was all the way last week. I'm not infallible

Jay: ""The Liches

Z: ""Ah, not long ago, we killed the Necromancer controlling a group of Liches, and now they're out for our blood. Naturally, this isn't any good. If the Liches get here, then, well... let's not talk about that. What I need is for you all to put your petty squabbling for my favor behind you and kick up your personal guard forces, cover more ground

The nobles were naturally rather shocked to hear this, was completely foreign to them and scary as it gets.

Steve: ""And, they'll probably just track you down and kill you anyway for associating with us. That and they're evil, so they might just do it for sport.""

Jay: ""Heidi

Heidi: ""Yes

Chainsaw: ""I'm with her. I think it'd be preferable to be able to wish for a dragon attacking the city to die spontaneously

Jay: ""Fair point.""

The nobles reluctantly accepted the task laid before them, we decided they all would be and anyone who thought himself fit to lead the group could come forward and prove himself.

We ended up with some Gandalf-looking guy coming forward, and even tried to tell the guy to back off. He turned out to be quite wise and intelligent, with vast knowledge of damn near everything. And so Gandalf was appointed as court wizard, and the mages had their first task given to them, which they dutifully accepted and got to doing.

More servants and guards were brought

Z: ""Say what now?""

Gandalf: ""Every item you brought forward not only has magical qualities, we have no been able to discern it, and the best course of action would be to smelt all of the items down.""

Z: ""If we had them crafted into other things, evil, or both?""

Gandalf: ""Items with magical affinity will always have magical properties, since it is beginning anew, unless it's Drowcraft or something to that effect.""

Z: ""Woah. That's neat. When a phylactery is destroyed

Gandalf: ""Yes. Upon being destroyed, what one could call a soul would escape from the box, destroying the Lich in the process. The same goes if part of the phylactery was a bottle with an enchanted liquid inside; when the bottle broke, a soul would be seen leaving the liquid.""

Steve: ""That's pretty cool. So all we have to do is smelt all of these things one by one and watch them do it so we can tell whether or not a phylactery was destroyed?""

Gandalf: ""Yes

Jay: ""What if none of them are phylacteries? We'd kill the Lich and it would revive in a few days. Can we imprison or destroy a Lich without destroying the phylactery?""

Gandalf: ""Not by any normal means, one could potentially create an anti-magic field to store the Lich's body in before it revives. You could also carve and enchant Silencing runes on the bones, in which case the Lich would be trapped within the bones, unable to use its powers to revive.""

Jay: ""That's neat. So if we don't destroy a phylactery

Chainsaw: ""I don't think 'just kill the Lich' is an okay way to put it. We only got away with killing two because we were lucky. And then these two absorbed the other two. They're even more powerful now. And they're still smart. If they've been watching us

Heidi: ""Well

We brought all the crap to the blacksmiths and had them smelt everything down, kind of like the way Paranormal Activity ended. We all rejoiced, as there was still a lot of stuff to smelt down, and hopefully somewhere in there was the other one.

We never found the second one. We even decided to smelt any coinage we found, and it was likely even more vengeful than before.

Chainsaw: ""Well

Gandalf: ""Yes. In fact, the Lich's soul was stripped, but its magical power would have faded over the course of a few hours.""

Chainsaw: ""But we didn't destroy the phylacteries of the other ones. We had only temporarily killed them.""

Gandalf: ""You must have destroyed their phylacteries in some way. If you were in the thick of combat

Z: ""But I was standing right over the bottles I smashed when they were absorbed... Wait, breaking the phylacteries? We wouldn't have seen or heard anything.""

Gandalf: ""That's quite possible

Heidi: ""But we still have one crazy vengeful Lich out there who probably knows where we are and could completely raze the city

Z: ""So, fun. Or most likely boned. You should check out Chainsaw's leg, it's all weird and stuff after we lopped it off and regrew it.""

Chainsaw had taken Steve's advice to wear shorts and a long piece of loose fabric to cover up his demon leg, and Gandalf's eyes widened at the sight of it.

Gandalf: ""So you encountered a Great Wraith

Knowing what could have happened

The next few days of noble life were actually quite fun. We checked out the city, and people quickly grew to like their new ruler. Z had been taking notes the whole time and was rather quiet, though, which was unusual.

Steve: ""You're far too quiet. What are you planning?""

Z: ""It'd be unfair to not tell the people that we have a Lich coming, start training them to defend themselves, since he'll probably bring an army. Reinforce walls, be vigilant, report any suspicious activity. If they trust us, they'll do it instead of fleeing. And if they invaded and half of our city is in chaos, then it'll be much harder to defend. If we had a bunch of dudes firing crossbows at the zombie hordes from their windows

Jay: ""What's gotten into you? You're planning things that don't involve random acts of insanity. Are you joining us normal people now? It'd be great if you were.""

Z: ""Nah

Steve: ""... What do you mean

Z: ""Oh, stocked food and water in a panic room, bought loads of locks for doors. 2012 is coming up soon, you know. What have you done to prepare?""

Chainsaw: ""... So you're carrying over your own paranoid insanity into the game? That's... actually quite brilliant. What kind of shotgun did you buy?""

Z: ""I'll give you my specs later. For now, hand out weapons... rally the remaining blacksmiths and armorers, we need to tell them to get to crafting easy to use weapons. Check up on the nobles, and see what the mages say about anti-undead and anti-magic wards and the like.""

A few hours later

Steve: ""The nobles you sent me to? Their house was completely abandoned

Chainsaw: ""So was mine.""

Heidi: ""And mine.""

Jay: ""Mine were all still there and were keeping a constant vigil.""

The dudes I was sent to were still there as well

Z: ""So three families have fled. We have five ones still here. Better than nothing. Gandalf said all of that stuff is certainly possible, and make sure everyone knows that they're invited.""

Jay: ""We should send word to the noble families to come out and talk to people as well. We're all the same when it's war. We should work on reinforcing the castle as well as we can as well; it'll be a last bastion in case they make it that far.""

Steve: ""The Lich will probably be in the middle or back of the group

Heidi: ""I'll go gather the holy men of the city and have them consecrate everything they can

Chainsaw: ""I'll take care of overseeing training. Maybe teach them some Paladin techniques if I can. The more Holy magic we can use

Z: ""Solid ideas. I'll call up Gandalf and see if he can teach some people basic magic. Fireballs and stuff. Not to be sexist

Everyone started working on their plans while criers informed everyone possible about the celebration. Most of the city turned up, even annoying kids. Tried to get on a first name basis and everything. The Nobles covered a fair amount of ground as well, most likely making this the most successful celebration yet. We prepared all day the next day, and then the second day came. Criers made sure everyone knew about the speech, and the whole city showed up, even the delinquents.",,,,

When we last left off, who had come straight to the castle to engage us. We had caused a large amount of damage to the Lich while suffering few casualties on our part, and then the Lich decided that he'd had enough and decided to turn the tables on us. Big time.

Chris: ""The Lich roars in anger as blue flames explode outwards from him, and casts a spell that warps space and time for you, along with Gandalf. When the warp is over, you stand up and look around to find yourselves in a massive labyrinth.""

Z: ""... Did you... maze us? Are you fucking serious? We were doing *so well!* And then you drop this on us. Great. I thought we were done with the spontaneous screwing over?""

Chris: ""Well

Z: ""Goddammit. What's the labyrinth look like?""

Chris: ""Exactly like the one from the movie Labyrinth. Stone walls about 12-15 feet high. Behind you is a path that leads to a seemingly endless desert with a ranging sandstorm right in the middle of it. The left corridor extends for miles. The path ahead of you forks off in three directions.""

Steve: ""Dude, forcing us to smelt down the stuff from the tower, and screwing us over with the whole Stygia thing. Why do you do these things to us?""

Chris: ""Because you were winning too easily. I had to do something to challenge you.""

Chainsaw: ""So you maze us? You bastard.""

Jay: ""*Deep sigh.* Alright

Chris: ""Yeah

Jay: ""Alright. Z

Chris: ""They lift you up to the top of the walls. As you pull yourself up

Z: ""Figures. I'll relay the information and call everyone to get up here. How far are the gaps between the walls?""

Chris: ""Far enough that you'll be making checks every time.""

Heidi: ""Could we map it out so we'd know which way we were going?""

Chainsaw: ""Labyrinths are constantly changing. Remember how much David Bowie was screwing with Sarah in the movie? Mapping it out would take an absurdly long time

Heidi: ""Shit

Chris: ""I didn't think of that... dammit. Alright

Z: ""I wanna aim my descent so that I land on one of the walls.""

Chris: ""Alright

Jay: ""Oh boy. It's riddle time

Chris: ""As you climb up the statues

Heidi: ""What kind of mask is he wearing? What masks are all of the statues wearing?""

Chris: ""The statue that bitch-slapped Jay has a happy jester's mask on. Going clockwise, the next has a mask with swirly patterns all around, the one next to that has a neutral jester's mask, and the last one has a zombie mask.""

Steve: ""So every other statue is a jester mask. Hmmm. Can we leave this area of the maze?""

Chris: ""Fun time. As you walk towards one of the exits, the zombie one, becomes animate and steps down from the pedestal. Roll initiative.""

Z: ""Fuck that noise. Guys

Jay: ""Yeah

Chris: ""As you run towards the wall

Chainsaw: ""Grappling hook.""

Z: ""Animate rope to bring the grappling hook up here. I ain't dealing with this.""

Chris: ""Dammit... you pull the rope up and secure the hook. Who's going up first?""

Heidi: ""Send Gandalf up. Chainsaw should probably go last since he could probably catch anyone that falls.""

Z: ""I'm gonna try and use a Hold spell on the statue to slow it down.""

Chris: ""Well

He landed a natural 20, the rest of the statues animated and proceeded to punch hand holds into the wall and start climbing.

Z: ""NOPE. You guys can screw around with the golems if you want

Steve: ""Totally. Time to rock out

And so they sang Magic Dance

Z: ""Can I sing it so that when he says

Chris: ""You can try

Z: ""In hindsight

Steve: ""Damn right it is. Van Halen's great

They ended up singing the full song (About 5 minutes long) twice before we were fairly close. We had rolled about 30 or so jump checks. We weren't going to screw around running in circles in the maze, and having loads of fun singing. Here's the scene if anyone hasn't seen it, and you should be able to find the full one in the related videos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvyNOg4jSRg

Eventually we had made it to the tower on the other side of the labyrinth. We hopped off of the walls in front of the tower and prepared ourselves for a hell of a fight. We kicked down the front door and stormed up the stairs

Lich: ""So

Z: ""Well

Lich: ""And you're against me as well

Gandalf: ""Naturally. You've gone too far

Chainsaw: ""If you're so confident in the fact that you're going to win

Lich: ""I suppose that's fair. Your people were well prepared. My minions have done nothing but fail me. Naturally

Heidi: ""Well

Lich: ""Speaking of the day

Z: ""Oh, then it will be. You should have figured this out by now. We're cheating bastards.""

Lich: ""And so you are... no matter

Before we could even pick up our dice

Gandalf: ""You may think yourself infallible

And with that, preventing us from doing so. Jaws dropped all around the table as we were told what was happening.

Chris: ""After gutting himself, and a deafening scream emanates from where the Lich once stood, and a huge soul escapes from the end of the cannon of magic and blood. After this happens, Gandalf doubles over and falls to the ground, dead.""

Everyone was silent. Chris had been out to end us for quite a while now, Z spoke up.

Z: ""Uhhh... can we resurrect him? Somebody has True Resurrection

Chris: ""Gandalf gave his very soul to eliminate the Lich. There is no way to resurrect him by any normal means.""

Z: ""He gave his soul... where do souls usually go? Some kind of vortex somewhere? Another plane? What?""

Chris: ""His soul has been destroyed forever. The spell tore it apart.""

Heidi: ""I still have two wishes. Could I wish for his soul to be reformed and return to his body?""

Chris: ""No.""

Z: ""Well, and preserve it so it doesn't rot.""

Steve: ""Why do you want to preserve it? We should give him a proper burial.""

Z: ""Because we're gonna go call down a God and get some divine intervention. Gods are all-powerful. They could restore a soul

We all agreed that this was a good idea if we wanted our main man back

The undead had fallen when the Lich had been slain, and declared that today to be a holiday celebrating our triumph over the undead hordes and in memory of Gandalf.

Afterwards

Chainsaw: ""So you want to call a God to work a miracle on him?""

Z: ""That's the idea.""

Steve: ""How do you plan on doing that?""

Z: ""Not sure yet.""

Steve: ""What if they refuse?""

Z: ""Then we'll kill them and take everything. Their powers

When we last left off, geared, and were ready for war. The legions of undead were spotted standing at the horizon, waiting for the word to charge. Generals had been recruited to lead various forces and direct the people should things get nasty, and we were standing on top of the castle awaiting the Lich, since he was sure to come straight for us.

Steve: ""This is awesome. We might get screwed over

Jay: ""Yup yup. But with great power comes great responsibility.""

Z: ""Uncle Ben! You're back from the dead!""

Jay: ""Shut up

As they bickered and bullshitted with each other

Z: ""Sound the alarms! Do we have any alarms? Sound them if we do. If we don't

Chainsaw: ""Did Gandalf get those wards in place?""

Chris: ""Yes

Steve: ""Are the zombies going to explode when they run into them or something? Or is it just going to make some sort of barrier?""

Chris: ""Gandalf set up barriers outside the city and along the streets at choke points

Steve: ""Nice. How far do you think the undead themselves will get? We know the Lich will probably just do his thing and come right up here

Chris: ""Well, they shouldn't have much trouble with the zombies.""

Chainsaw: ""What if there's other things

Z: ""Somewhere

Chris: ""As the horde rushes towards the city

Jay: ""Good God

Z: ""Well

Chris: ""Naturally, they begin to smash on the shield, which is rapidly deteriorating.""

Steve: ""Don't we have barrels of oil and torches for the archers to dip their arrowheads in and light?""

Chris: ""Indeed you do. The hulking zombies are hit by the arrows and ignite and burn out before they have time to get to the second barrier. More hulking zombies are moving among the ranks to get to the second barrier.""

Jay: ""Catapults?""

Chainsaw: ""Naturally.""

Chris: ""The catapults launch burning stones into the field

Heidi: ""This is going far too well. What's the estimated kill count?""

Chris: ""Probably around 1200 altogether. You're right to question it

Z: ""And so the barricades were set on fire.""

Chris: ""And they were. The wights reach the barricade and are stopped dead in their tracks by the massive wall of fire. Some are not so quick

Steve: ""That is so cool. We've got this. Can we attach flasks of oil to the arrows the archers are firing and shoot them at the slabs of wood to make them more easy to burn?""

Chris: ""I hadn't thought of that... clever idea. I'll let you do it. Takes the concentrated fire of at least ten archers to pull it off.""

Chainsaw: ""Good God

Chris: ""About 25' by 25' and at least 6-8 inches thick. After taking a few of the shields down and causing more trouble for the undead

Z: ""That's fine

Chris: ""And that they are not. Behind them, and begin aiming for the murder holes of the archers with fireballs once the barricades are no longer burning. The hulking dead smash through the barricade and begin slamming against the doors of the city.""

Jay: ""And so it begins... bring out the militia into the street and have the mages and archers position themselves on rooftops and in windows. Are the skeletal archers firing in an arc

Chris: ""Still at the archers. Very few casualties among the archers have happened

Jay: ""Have them put sheets of iron in front of the murder holes to avoid and more fire and get ready to shoot at the undead coming through the gates.""

Heidi: ""Did we ever to consecrate the place? I could have sworn we had the gates blessed and whatnot.""

Chris: ""That never happened

Z: ""So they have holy hand grenades? That's awesome. Do we have any holy weapons?""

Chris: ""The strongest members of the army that are farther into the city have blessed weapons

Chainsaw: ""This is so cool. We should take over cities and do things like this more often.""

Heidi: ""Wouldn't murdering a political leader and taking his place be considered an act of extreme evil? And then we'd have loyalists on our hands and whatnot.""

Chainsaw: ""Details. Do we see the Lich yet?""

Chris: ""About time somebody asked that. From the edge of the horizon, he has doubled in size, and his eyes now burn bright blue and are visible from a great distance. The land that he steps on begins to wither and die rapidly; grass dies, soil becomes unable to support plant life, and flowers wilt. With a wave of his hand, the cavalry begins to charge. He walks in a bit farther before he begins to float, and eventually starts flying towards the castle

Jay: ""Ahhh

Chris: ""Naturally. The Lich gets closer and closer

Lich: ""Is *this* what you were looking for? You can have it. I don't need it anymore. I have ascended to a level beyond comprehension. I have joined the Gods!""

Chris: ""The Lich then proceeds to crush the box in his hand

Z: ""Set up the A/M and anti-undead wards, but between us, Gandalf, the archers, and the soldiers, we'll have quite the advantage.""

Chris: ""Jay was right. Hearing this kind of planning from you is really, and begins to laugh.""

Lich: ""You really think *this* can stop *me?* You're a bunch of right fools. I'm impressed you've survived this long.""

The Lich proceeded to toss several bolts of lightning and fire at the ward

Lich: ""What is this sorcery?! I have reached Godhood!""

Gandalf walked up the stairs

Gandalf: ""I put that one up myself. You'll have a hard time with that one

The group's jaws dropped and their faces went pale at the thought of Gandalf possibly being another Lich.

Z: ""Say what now?""

Gandalf: ""Yes, and was never satisfied with what he had. After 33 years, he had gone completely mad. He began the ritual to trade his morality for the powers of a Lich one day, and I fled. Looking back on it, I should have stopped him before he finished, but now I have the chance to end his madness by your side.""

Z: ""Best be joking

Gandalf: ""I did. I learned he had been enslaved by a Necromancer, I suspected that he was one of them. But I never thought he would be the one to assault the city... even though he was quite powerful, many Liches are ancient beings from a time long passed. When you slew the Necromancer, his control over the Liches must have faded.""

Lich: ""Hmph. You time ends now, we will encroach upon your castle. Make peace with your Gods, fools.""

Jay: ""Yeah

We all rolled

Chris: ""You look closely at the city and notice buildings warping and fires that are not spreading. The images shown to you by the Lich are clearly hallucinations.""

Heidi: ""Yeah

Chris: ""Nope. That's like trying to cast Hold Person on a Demigod. It won't work unless you have some kind of crazy luck

Heidi: ""Shit. Can we signal the archers to start firing

Chris: ""Indeed you can. The master archers you selected peek out from behind the arrow slits of the keeps on the side of the castle and unleash a barrage of arrows at the Lich. Several of them hit, completely cloaked in flame.""

Lich: ""Enough! This ends now. Lay down your weapons

All that changed this week.

3.5
I'm playing a 3rd lvl human swashbuckler who's feats are used up being proficient in the exotic spiked chain. Unfortunately we've spent the short campaign as prisoners and haven't had much choice. 
The party was forced (no we couldn't escape
Anyways the final days event was a royal rumble style melee (last to yield or be knocked out wins) with real weapons. During the fight we are ganging up on this noble dude from some bullshit rich family. Our lady barbarian has beaten him ragged. Having knocked out 2 npcs I really wanted to make the hat trick so on my turn I ran up behind him and attack with my spiked chain. Now here I have to admit that I was feeling quite the D&amp;D bloodlust. I haven't fought or killed a thing yet
So before I roll to attack I say
Natural 20.
""Roll to confirm""
18 plus stuff.
""Roll damage""
More than enough to finish him.
My spiked chain wraps around his throat and tightens, and slumps to the ground making a death gurgle. I say to our DM, ""I look to his family in the audience and I shrug like ""oops"" and grin"". He tells me that they wail in agony.
Right then the rogue in our party decides she wants to win and is disgusted by this murder. So she attacks me
""I guess I yank on it as hard as I can
Natural 20
Head pops right off and the audience gasps again. Women and children cry and cover their eyes. His family members faint and vomit. I look to the rogue and grin whilst attacking.
My Character ends up winning the entire Alabaster Cup and the people have to honor me despite being a vicious killer. How fun. I won. The end.

In the second part of the game, the nasty kobold commoner.

First they tried to reason with it.  But Saug really needed this cloth.  If he didn't, and beaten by his superiors (Instead of being yelled at and being told how his life is worthless).  When that didn't work, so they tried to intimidate him.  All 5 try, but Saug has a swagger and it doesn't work.  ""Saug is victorious""!  After saying that a few times, and being asked by a PC if the PC will have to hit Saug, Saug replies ""Saug not used to choice"".

It devolved from there, painted him a picture, ext.  After time went by, the more fighty people got bored.  So they encountered three kobold guards and a guard dog.  Seeing his chance, Saug took action as well.

The psion and monk were taken down in the first round thanks to some lucky rolls on my part.  Saug picked up a rock and hits the bard who was guarding him.  Double critical.  ""Saug is victorious.""  Dammit

The fighter sees this all fall down and panics.  He had wanted to fight, to be exact.

http://imgur.com/a/Wtp7S

I've been working on this castle for the last four months or so. I originally started it as a side project just for fun

A few facts about the castle:

* In total it measures 2' wide
* I used molds from Hirst Arts to make each individual brick before assembling the castle. The castle is made up of more than 5
* The material cost for the Castle is fairly low: 50 lbs of Plaster of Paris, and some Polyurethane. Maybe $40 in total.
* The cost of Molds, the mass of plastic ware to hold the bricks, and other items cost around $250. Luckily all that can be reused.

In total I spent around 400 hours on this project. That's every episode of Stargate (SG1, Six seasons of Doctor Who, Six Seasons of Psych, and a ton of other movies.

I still have some work to do. I have grass and shrubs to decorate the outside of the castle. I need to build doors and stairs in the castle. And if I'm still interested by that point

Just a heads up: There's a lot of fudging that goes on, so stuff made sense at the time. Thinking about it, I'm not sure how it worked, but when there's enough alcohol and you haven't slept in a while, anything goes. So bear with me and try your hardest not to call out things that don't make sense. Feel free to correct anything major, though.

And I promise that while it might seem like mindless fighting and quick thinking at the moment

When we last left off, and even then they'd still be alive. Chainsaw had given Z all of his stuff in case he pulled the Ruins card, which makes all of your non-magic gear disappear permanently.

Chainsaw had said that he was going to pull cards while he had the chance

Then he pulled his second card

Silence all around. Chris seemed quite pleased with himself. Chainsaw relayed how to get to the tower.

Steve: ""The fuck do you mean

Chainsaw: ""I mean it's on the Astral Plane.""

Jay: ""You saw how to get there

Chainsaw: ""The portal I saw was the one on that side of the room.""

Z: ""That goes to the Abyss. No way am I going in there. And what are we going to do about the Liches? They've got us pinned down

Steve: ""Yeah

Heidi: ""Well

Z: ""I'm pretty sure the number of cards left depends on the person drawing from it. So I have 17

We ended up rolling with the individual draws. Then we remembered that we were in combat.

Chainsaw's Fighter had tried to stab one of the Liches and missed, and anything else in the room to avoid its absurdly powerful spells.

Jay: ""Alright

Heidi: ""Well

Z: ""I was using my songs and Bardic stuff. I still have the spells I didn't use on the way up.""

Steve: ""How many was that?""

Z: ""A lot

Jay: ""Awesome. Look up your most powerful stuff

Z: ""I've got Hold Monster. Enough time to set ourselves up assuming the Fighter can keep the other one busy.""

Jay: ""Perfect. Fantastic. Do that as soon as you can.""

A plan was hatched. However, this was going to be a difficult save. 

Jay got hit with the green beam. Instant death by poisoning. But he managed to save against it and took constitution damage instead. Lucky bastard. Z got hit by two red beams, shit. One dude down. Chainsaw managed to save vs. Insanity and took 40 damage. Once again, not that big a deal. Heidi managed to save against everything she could, taking only 20 points of damage. But that wasn't it.

Our loyal knight was nailed by the Indigo beam and Yellow beam. Yellow does 80 points of damage. Indigo drives you insane. Failed both. Now we have a fighter in the corner babbling nonsense and playing with his nipples while giving off electric discharge. The Lich finished him off and turned to us.

Steve: ""So

Z: ""Well

Heidi: ""Use your turn to drag Jay over here. If we're touching each other

Steve: ""Would the Liches be able to teleport there? They *are* level 20+ Wizards that can do basically everything.""

Jay: ""Well

Z: ""We could always pull more cards.""

Heidi: ""We're not screwing around with the cards anymore. At least not now. Too much on the line. Let's just do the teleporting thing since we're screwed if we don't.""

We all eventually agreed, healed up at the inn, and got to planning.

Jay: ""Alright. We have two superpowered Liches following us. What can we do to throw them off our tracks.""

Z: ""Deck of Many Things!""

Jay: ""If you want to pull from the deck

Z: ""You know

Steve: ""What if we hired mercenaries to draw from the deck or something? There's that one card that lets you make wishes.""

Z: ""If you had that kind of power

Steve: ""Fair point. What if we charmed someone into it? You're a Bard

Z: ""Don't you know anything? Barmaids are always succubi. Play more games

Steve: ""Then splash some holy water during foreplay or something. Or get her to shove a holy symbol up her hoo-hah. That'd be hilarious. Having a succubus fry her own uterus with a cross. Oh

Z: ""That's brilliant

Chainsaw: ""Well you're wasting time by arguing it. Go sing her a song and get her up here to pull cards.""

Z: ""The things I do...""

Heidi: ""Oh

Z: ""Fair enough. I'm gonna go seduce a barmaid and use her to pull cards from the deck.""

Chris: ""They have to be willing.""

Z: ""I'm making her willing. And then telling her what to do.""

Chris: ""So you're mind-raping her? I don't know if you can do that. Even if you can

Steve: ""Chainsaw

Chris: ""Dammit

Chainsaw: ""So we get to beat up Hades?""

Jay: ""No

Chainsaw: ""But how did he get there? You wound up in the Abyss when you jumped through his portal.""

Z: ""I don't know

Steve: ""Let's start with getting to the Outer Planes. We'll work our way to the Gray Waste once we're there. We need to find a Wizard that has this kind of knowledge.""

Z: ""We could ask the drunken idiots at the bar and get nowhere. Or we could be daring and use the Deck. The Moon and the Vizier

Jay: ""You're insane, or Fates. Let's do it.""

He announced that he'd pull one card after relinquishing all of his possessions. Flames. Causes enmity between the character and an Outsider.

Jay: ""You know

Z: ""Could we interrogate the Outsider, right?""

Jay: ""That... makes a lot of sense. I never thought I'd say a supportive thing to you that wasn't about your insane plans working. Chris

Chris: ""Well

Heidi: ""Oh yeah... we should probably go before they raze the town looking for us. I wouldn't doubt them burning everything to the ground until they find us. They'd probably do it even if they found us by scrying.""

Chainsaw: ""What if we got a priest to cast some kind of ward evil or ward undead spell in a bubble around us? Or use something to prevent scrying and detection?""

Z: ""Then the Outsider won't find us. And that's our key out.""

Jay: ""Well Outsiders aren't necessarily evil. There's just enmity.""

Chris: ""Yeah, but you can do it.""

Z: ""To the church!""

And so we spent four days in the dark basement of a church surrounded by runes. Our only entertainment was an exorcism

And then in the middle of the night on day four

We successfully knocked him out and bound him as well as you can bind something like him. Then we spent for-goddamn-ever interrogating him on getting to the Planes. He revealed that it could be reached with a fairly complex spell that he was nice enough to teach us

We tossed him into the portal first to make sure he wasn't going to explode into hunks of magical meat upon contact, and was inhabited by lame things, so we decided to head North to Elysium and find a city.

After seemingly endless walking and Z singing Come Sail Away by Styx to increase our speed, so we sold whatever was useless to us and geared up with new stuff.

Eventually we decided it was time to roll out to the Gray Waste after stocking up on loads of gear. Walking across the Outlands took four days

Chris told Chainsaw that the phylacteries were in a tower on the second layer of Hades

Chainsaw: ""Seriously

Chris: ""No use complaining now.""

After fighting endless hordes of undead and evading the Gods that resided in Hades, and made our way to the top.

Chris: ""You know

Everyone's eyes grew to the size of dinner plates as Chris laughed heartily.

Z: ""You said that it opened a hidden cabinet to the right of the portal that had the phylacteries in it! I wrote it down! It's right here

Chris: ""You know, but you cut me off and said you were going to smash the phials on the floor. I was seriously about to read it to you.""

Z: ""You're a dick

Chris: ""Well maybe if you didn't kick him off a floating island to be eaten by devil-spiders he might have enlightened you more.""

Z: ""You told me they were the phylacteries! How was I supposed to know to move the phials around?! What Necromancer puts instructions on the back of a cubby? What

We had finally found the hideout of the campaign's villain, so I immediately cast the fireworks version of Pyrotechnics. *Everyone* in the room failed their save (including the party and even the high-will paladin and cleric) and was blinded for 4 rounds - except me, because I happened to be 12**5** feet away and just out of range.

The villain was alone, and they all begin beating on him. He might have been strong, but when blind, anyone can be hit easily. It comes to a total of 8d6 per round from the Archons, and 4d6+28 from the elementals combined.

On the last round of blindness, that damage on top of all the summoned creatures for that round proves to be enough to bring him down. I don't remember how much I rolled, but DM said that I did over 150 damage in total, so... I stood there in shock a moment, then started looting his body.

1371414123.0,1gh0f1,[Update] Dungeons &amp; Dragons.. for a 4 year old girl,joeflux,262,41,57,"3 months ago I asked for help for doing Dungeons &amp; Dragons for a 4 year old girl.

Well, so I'm sure that what we're doing isn't d&amp;d.  We don't even use dice.

As a sample

She was a fairy that woke up in a underground pool of slime.  She made her way into the dungeons, and spoke to a princess.

The princess explained that a dragon had been eating them, bravely said that she would fight the dragon.  The princess gave the fairy a wolf to follow and protect her.

She left the hall, and the bones were from the men the dragon had eaten.

Then she turned a corner and came face to face with the dragon.

Dragon: ""I'm going to eat you!""

Her: ""Don't eat me!""

Dragon: ""But I'm so hungry!""

Her: ""Eat my wolf instead!""

Dragon: ""Okay."" 

&lt;eats wolf&gt;

Dragon: ""I'm still so hungry!""

Her: (Genuinely kinda scared

Dragon: ""I don't want to

Her: ""Oh

Dragon: ""Thank you.  I hate eating people.  Really

Her: ""Come with me.""

&lt;wonder around a bit

She returns to the princess, until the fairy fell asleep from tiredness.


The fairy wakes up the next morning, and goes back to the princess hall.  There in the hall is the dragon, all alone. 

Dragon:  ""I flew around and around

Her: ""Oh

&lt;She then goes to the princess's kitchen and proceeds to make a chocolate cake.  Each time the dragon asks to lick the bowl

She then meets up with the princess and her guards who were huddled scared in a room.  She brokers a peace between the princess and the dragon

They had another big party (with chocolate cake), but the fairy quickly put a stop to that sort of talk.

Then she left

My Custom Gaming Table [pics](http://imgur.com/a/tVI3l)


*Inspired by [this table](http://redd.it/18olti)


I plan to add a bit more to it, another hardboard sitting on that one to provide a flat surface for the gaming mat, and a sheet of acrylic to go on top of that.


The acrylic holds wet-erase markers just great. It can hold reds unlike the chessex mega-mat under it. As there are two layers for the actual map bit


The underside has an LED strip under it, red for enraged bosses or volcano-type areas, blue for the watery zones, etc. Normally its on various intensities of white.


With the legs being 6 inches


It's portable enough to move between upstairs and downstairs for use in the gaming room or the dining room depending on the night.


Parts list

* 36x48 acrylic sheet
* 48x96 hardboard
* 2 1x3x6 pine board
* 1x3x8 pine board
* Screws
* 5 6in precut table legs
* 16ft color change LED strip lights
* 4 LED strip light connectors $6 [amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z3AU7K/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)


Build time was a little over an hour.


While not actually a part of the table

Condition Cards available from [Ben's RPG Pile](http://bensrpgpile.com)


**Edit:** fixed the list, added condition card links.


**Update April 17th 2013:** I've added description and lame diagrams to help with the screw placement and assembly

I just wanted to offer you thanks for putting together this community and all of its pooled resources. I've not commented or actively participated in your community

Until last night, but a few of us decided to try it out anyway. I began studying like a madman, reading anything and everything I could get my hands on and watching as much DnD on Youtube as possible.


My wife and I hosted a game night at our place, we sat down and got going, none of us really knowing quite what we should be doing. But a half-hour into the game, the kids were already begging (literally) to make DnD a weekly activity. At the official stopping time for our game, they begged to play another hour. At the end of that hour, they still hadn't completed the quest, so they're coming back in a few days to finish! I could not have imagined things going as well as they did. Frankly between my inexperience and the stigma of the game, but now it looks like we'll be playing regularly together for some time to come. We were the loudest

We couldn't have had this experience without the unknowing support of r/DnD. Your advice to one another, exciting world that we can share together. Thanks!!

tl;dr-- We had a great first night of DnD,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,t3_15wju4
1355536985.0,14vigj,Stealing Immortality - Rise of the Second (Part 13),,266,76,43,"Alright, Kurtulmak! Along the way, Gandalf

Chainsaw ran right at the wounded God, calling down lightning, striking areas with waves of flame, and unleashing bursts of air so cold that the beasts were frozen solid before they could even comprehend the situation. They were handling the seemingly endless waves well, pushing them back and preventing them from advancing. We all assisted Chainsaw as well as we could, tossing in our own attacks when we had an opening and buffing and healing him while he struck the God with all of his might, unloading his most powerful abilities upon him. His wounds eventually crippled him to the point of senselessness

The waves of kobolds from the mineshaft began to overwhelm Z and Gandalf, slowly becoming more and more powerful in an effort to defeat us after seeing their God's pain. Even the powers of a grand magus and a God could not hold back their rampaging fury, and we all pitched in to help them.

Just when it seemed like we would be completely overwhelmed

Chris: ""You swing your axe, slashing open his jugular and nearly severing his head from his body. He falls to his knees while he attempts to stem the bleeding from his neck, but his efforts prove useless as the last of his breath leaves his lungs. A colorless energy begins to seep from Kurtulmak's neck wound, swirling around as it begins to join with its new master. You feel the energy flowing through you at an incredible rate. Your strength increases drastically as the last of the energy flows into you. There is no doubt about it; you have achieved Godhood.""

Chainsaw: ""Nice.""

Z: ""Welcome to the club

Steve: ""Two down

Z: ""Ohhh

Jay: ""... Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye...""

Steve: ""WHERE DO WE GO NOW

And so we sang that part of Sweet Child O' Mine again as some kind of victory song.

Heidi: ""Alright

Chainsaw: ""Well, too. We just slew one of their Gods in his own mine.""

Jay: ""Very true. Who wants to pick next?""

We rolled off

Steve: ""Sweet. Uhhh... let's go to Hades.""

Z: ""I hope you don't mean the God, he's regarded as being the most powerful one in the entirety of the Outer Planes.""

Steve: ""Yeah

Heidi: ""Basically all of the Four Horsemen combined into one guy.""

Steve: ""Alright

Z: ""No. Pick another one.""

Steve: ""But this one's my decision...""

Heidi: ""Yeah

Steve: ""Alright, and trickery.""

Z: ""Good God

Steve: ""DEATH TO THE MIDGETS! To Glitterhell!""

Jay: ""Problem.""

Steve: ""What now?""

Jay: ""Nobody knows where it is. We're gonna be dicking around the Gray Wastes for a while.""

Steve: ""Perfectly fine. More experience.""

Jay: ""For those of us who still need it. Alright

And so we spent many, searching for some kind of cave filled with gold and gemstones. Eventually, we stumbled upon a mountain with a mouth fitting the description.

Steve: ""Rockin'. Let's get to work.""

We were opposed by plenty of golems made of gems and gold, until we reached a thick door made of solid gold and inlaid with gems the size of a baby's head.

Steve: ""Sweet. I run up and kick the door in.""

Chris: ""Make a strength check.""

Steve: ""Alright

Z: ""Chainsaw

Chainsaw: ""You take one

Naturally

Chris: ""As you enter the room

He failed miserably.

Chris: ""Save against death.""

Steve: ""Whaaaat? He threw the hammer THAT hard?""

Z: ""Well

The dice were on his side

Steve: ""Alright

Chainsaw entered first this time

Abbathor: ""What the blazes do you want? Go away

Steve: ""Doing what

Z: ""That was possibly the lamest thing you could say

Steve: ""Shut up

Z: ""What

Steve: ""No

Abbathor: ""Damn right I am. Get the hell out before I crush you like a bug

Steve: ""No way

Chainsaw: ""We should have picked someone and let him get the killing blow or something like that. He's gonna die. A lot.""

Jay: ""Yeah, and I suppose we're here to support him, aren't we?""

Z: ""Bros *do* stick together. Even though it's kind of reluctantly at the moment.""

And so we rolled off initiative, and the fight became very interesting, very quickly...

... And that's the end of 13.

Super exciting news: After careful consideration, and soon we'll be able to appreciate their incredible art along with more story parts. Part one of SI as a story is in production, and I'll release more details as it comes together.

1355440062.0,14t7v2,Stealing Immortality - Gambling with the Gods,,281,93,35,"It's been two days since Part Nine of SI was posted

Word of warning: The mood of the campaign changes quite a bit. Sarcastic humor and the players bullshitting fades, let's dive in.

After Z had said his awesome-sounding thing, as calling down a God wasn't going to be simple. That, and kicking down their front door wasn't the best of ideas, or at least not yet.

Z: ""Alright

Everybody gave him a quizzical look

Z: ""Four cards. Steve

After Steve agreed

Z: ""Guess the castle's getting bigger. Right next to this one, Steve.""

He pulled his second card. Donjon. Well

Z: ""That's fine. I still have two cards left. If I can't draw

And so it did. The Deck reappeared in front of him in his cell in the bowels of the earth

Z: ""Alright

He pulled his last card. The Moon

Z: ""Good. Perfect. Fantastic. This is exactly what I needed. I'm sick of being a Bard. This sucks. Remember my awesome Thief, gear and all.""

Chris: ""Let me get this straight; you put your character

Z: ""That's exactly it, yes. Singing Magic Dance and Back in Black has been fun, but I can't do it anymore.""

Steve: ""Seems reasonable to me. Varan was the one with the crazy Protoss Zealot arm blade things

Z: ""Yup

Steve: ""I support this decision. Varan was freakin' awesome. Wasn't he the one you broke into the masquerade with to rob the entire palace blind and kidnap a noblewoman?""

Z: ""Yep.""

Jay: ""Yeah

Chris: ""Right. I imagine you dug up his sheets so I could see what you had?""

Z: ""Damn right I did. Three years worth of stuff was in the way

Chris: ""Alright, faster, and more cunning. All magical stuff you found on your Bard, like personal armor and weaponry, disappears despite it being in Steve's ownership.""

Z: ""Take it and fucking keep it. I should have been a thief from the start. I have no idea how I survived nearly 15 levels with that guy. Fates to get out of the cell.""

Chris: ""A flash of light appears in the throne room as a man you've never truly seen before appears in the center of the room. Although you've never seen him

Jay: ""I'm sure we can discern his identity from the arrogant way he walks and that evil grin he has. Or we could wait until he opens his mouth. I'm sure he's still the same asshole.""

Heidi: ""Yeah

Chainsaw: ""What if we built a church and convinced the people to worship whatever God it was built to? With enough praise over a certain period of time

Z: ""Let's not turn into Jehovahs

Chainsaw: ""What do oranges have to do with door-to-door religious people?""

Z: ""I'm surely not the only person that hurls fruit at the dude who's come to your house for the third time in the same week asking you if you've found Jesus in your life

Chainsaw: ""I think that can be considered assault. Maybe even with a weapon.""

Jay: ""Envisioning Z answering the door with a stalk of broccoli and making a horrible pun isn't very hard

Steve: ""Oh, motherfucker?'""

Chainsaw: ""I can even hear it in that snarky tone he uses... good God we're bad people. I can see Chris doing it

Z: ""Alright, if you were a judge and heard that you'd lose it and tell them to go away.""

And so the assault with a deadly fruit discussion continued until we remembered about Ormet, and a big believer in luck. So we called up the carpenters and masons and had them work with some scholars so they could build the most pleasing temple they could. Essentially, we had commissioned a shrine built inside of a pub/casino.

Word of our deeds had spread very quickly by the fast-moving oceanic trade cartels and traders moving out of the city. Triste went from a thriving port city to an absolutely booming one. The city grew larger and larger with more people flooding in. We gained several titles; the Hero Barons, or sometimes just the Heroes. Even though we tried to tell people Gandalf killed the Lich and not us, they kept it up. Everybody wanted to meet us at the massive parties we threw, since ruling is boring and starting bar fights and getting wasted with your subjects is fun. A team of artists came forward, asking if we'd pose for sculptures or portraits. The city began flourishing like it never had before, and we were having a blast.

Eventually the temple to Ormet was finished, but they came and had their fun while we did our religious thing. We weren't quite sure how we were supposed to know if it was working or not; we just assumed that we'd get some sort of divine sign eventually, but until then we'd gamble, drink, and party like animals.

One night, staying as long as we could. And then, one day, it happened. We were mingling about when a short man matching the description wandered in with a few guests of his own and sat down at an empty poker table. We figured this was our cue, walked over, and sat down.

Ormet: “Evenin'

Heidi: “Naturally. What kind of stakes are up?”

Ormet: “Nothin'

We played cards and threw dice for a few hours, Z spoke up.

Z: “So

Ormet put on a huge smile.

Ormet: “Alright

Z: “Well, y'know?”

He pulled the Deck out of one of his pockets and tossed it to Ormet.

Ormet: “What's this

Z: “That is a magical deck of cards with various effects. Now, there are many good cards in there as well, and if we draw them we could use them to bet. But how about this; you put your immortality on the line to level the playing field. All of your Godly powers. Play with me as a regular guy.”

Ormet: “Those are some steep prices

Z: “Well

Ormet: “... Alright

They agreed that the goal would be like blackjack, or someone pulled the Void or Donjon. Ormet worked his magic to make a deck that would function like that, as to not change the qualities of the one we had.

Ormet: “So

Z: “Me and you

The next few minutes were incredibly tense. Pained expressions running across both Z and Chris' face as they pulled bad cards and desperately hoped that they wouldn't pull the Void or Donjon. After several rounds of Z winning

Ormet: “This ain't fair. Yer winnin' far too much; you must be cheatin'!”

Z: “How can I be cheating? We've been going back and forth in shuffling. If anyone could be cheating

Ormet: “Watch yer mouth

Z: “Don't I? I had this temple built to honor you. We knew exactly what we were getting into. We've studied everything we could so we could win your favor more easily. And now you think I'm cheating? If there's someone who isn't being fair here

Ormet: “You shut yer mouth

Z: “You're on.”

All of the patrons of the church were watching this game. It was incredibly tense, Z managed to win.


Z: “I win again. Looks like the God of Luck wasn't as lucky as he was made out to be. The title's changing hands. You put your Godhood on the line.”

Ormet: “Enough! I've heard enough from you!”

Ormet drew his daggers and jumped across the table towards Z as he and the rest of the group drew their weapons

... And that's where part ten stops. When we come back, insult, tell your own stories. Have a good one.

1355505469.0,14umkt,Stealing Immortality - Waging War (Part 12),,264,83,31,"Alright, we decided that we should all try and do it for ourselves since we were already in trouble with the Plane of Water

Heidi: ""Wait a minute. We shouldn't be taking out the Gods here. These are the ones Chainsaw and I worship

Z: ""Well then denounce them and worship me instead. Bam

Heidi: ""That's... actually quite brilliant. Although I'm reluctant to

Z: ""And regular divine intervention would be pretty sweet, ""overpowered?""

Chainsaw: ""Yeah, they're just as powerful as you are. Maybe not as insane, but tough nonetheless. You've done something awesome, but don't let it do to your head. And the rest of us are still mortals.""

Z: ""Don't worry about anything. I've got plans. So

Chris: ""Tyr, and Trishina. It's ruled by Barachiel, and he'll probably come down to bomb your asses once he sees a bunch of dudes taking out his bros.""

Steve: ""Tyr's a viking. Let's not screw with him. What's Trishina the goddess of?""

Chris: ""She's an aquatic elf that sometimes swims around as a dolphin. She's the goddess of love

Steve: ""SLAUGHTER THE GODDESS OF INNOCENCE.""

Z: ""I sense radical alignment changes. But yeah

Heidi: ""This is probably *the* most fucked up thing we've ever done, but for now this is kind of like kicking a puppy.""

Steve: ""Well let's get this over with as quickly as possible

Jay: ""We could roll off on it

Heidi: ""Although this is messed up

And so we spent a while walking around and searching while Z had fun with his new powers. Walking on water

Trishina: ""Hello

Jay: ""Not a whole lot. Just here to check out the view and whatnot.""

Trishina: ""I see. I sense you are in the company of a newly realized God?""

Z: ""Yes, can you show me some things? I have no idea what I'm doing. Primarily about promoting mortals to Demigods and the like.""

And so Trishina taught Z all there was to know about Godhood

Steve: ""Good God we're dicks. She's so nice. I can't do this anymore. Let's go slay some evil deities. She's too... pure.""

Trishina: ""What ever are you talking about?""

Z: ""Well, who had his soul torn apart. Then we decided that we should go on a rampage and slay other Gods so we could all have fun... and for some reason, you were supposed to be our first target. Can you point us to the evil guys instead?""

She was shocked by this news, Kurtulmak. We managed to get to the Hells quickly, and were immediately swarmed by devils. And by swarmed, I mean we had about 25 flock to us at the same time within the first few minutes.

Jay: ""Well

Halfway through the battle, Chris stopped us for a moment.

Chris: ""As you fight off the devils, his hands smoking with power.""

Everyone rejoiced at the return of Gandalf; our badass Wizard friend couldn't let us tackle Baator alone. With his help

Gandalf: ""I sensed you were on a righteous quest to slay the evil deities, Z?""

Z: ""Can't steal all the glory. It wouldn't be any fun if I rained down bolts of lightning on every dude we came across

Gandalf: ""Fun must be cast aside in the Nine Hells. Use your newfound abilities to their fullest. While your weapons are still effective, and you shouldn't be engaging them fairly, either.""

Z: ""Alrighty then. The fun begins.""

And so we ran across the burning wasteland, but still stupid and easily slain kobolds into walls and crushed them like bugs. Eventually we saw an oversized one with a steel body and a tail dripping with venom mining away.

Gandalf: ""That's him. Steel your minds; he exudes an aura of fear. Even if he doesn't look menacing

Z: ""I'm gonna bless everyone with some kind of will bonus

Chris: ""Nope

Steve: ""Ahhh

Chris: ""Naturally. He's preoccupied with digging

And so our first real battle with a God had begun. Though we managed to cause quite a bit of damage and he was on equal footing with Z

Z: ""I'm gonna pull back and resurrect him. It only took a few minutes to revive Gandalf

It was, which dragged on and on, but it only made sense. The mortal members of the group actually dropped a few times, save for Chainsaw and Gandalf. Z was getting fairly roughed up too, but always bounced back due to some constant regeneration spell he had used.

The battle was incredibly rough. Z managed to taunt him and was practically dancing with the bastard

Eventually, sharpening their knives and smirking. Z and Gandalf turned to the kobolds and readied themselves to take on the hordes while the rest of us took on the God. Chainsaw charged in to take him on, one-on-one, while the rest of us supported him or Z and Gandalf. The most deadly encounter yet had begun!

... And so part twelve ends with Chainsaw and Kurtulmak getting ready to duke it out mano-a-mano

As usual, despise the cliffhangers, and tell your own stories.

So, but it spat us out on Stygia, the Fifth layer and a frozen wasteland dominated by a huge ocean with horrible things lurking in it.

Steve: ""Welp

Heidi: ""I think I do

And so we spent some time clearing out the deceptively small cave to be a suitable campsite while we planned out or next move. No monsters

Chainsaw: ""Hold on. Did I have any problems with the cold when we first got here?""

Chris: ""Nope. You were just fine. However

Chainsaw: ""Well

Jay: ""Sir

Chris: ""Yes

Chainsaw: ""A 19. Give it to me straight

Chris: ""As you look at yourself, the skin moves along with the motions more than it normally does, as if it was that nasty film on top of old pudding.""

Chainsaw: ""Oh

Steve: ""Aww, man. Describe it to us.""

Chainsaw: ""No

We rolled off on it

Z: ""Get a fig leaf or something

Chainsaw showed him the rash

Z: ""That's disgusting, man.""

Heidi: ""I'm not touching it. Can I do something to try and identify what's wrong?""

Chris: ""Sure can. You call upon your knowledge of nasty stuff that you learned in Cleric school and are able to identify that the flesh underneath the skin is beginning to rot. Without proper treatment, and that he will become a member of the undead if you don't do something.""

Z: ""Check him for more rashes. I imagine you can regrow limbs

Jay: ""Hold up. Contact with the ghoul made this happen. We should do something so that nobody has to touch him.""

Chainsaw: ""Don't I get any say in this?""

A unanimous ""no"" swept across the table as Chainsaw sighed deeply. After looking over spells and abilities that would let us cleave his leg off without touching it, and got lucky with a Summon Monster spell that brought forth an Earth Elemental that we had cleave off his leg and toss it into the ocean. Not long after we did, something came up and snatched it from the surface. We noped the fuck back into the cave faster than the Flash.

Heidi: ""Alright

Chris: ""You cast the spell on Chainsaw, but it is covered in bony plates beneath the skin, and the shin looks like it is bent backwards at points. His foot becomes clawed, as well.""

Z: ""Oh

Chris: ""No

Heidi: ""Well

Z: ""Maybe he'll have a super leg. He could use it like a second weapon since it's all bony. Or maybe it'll give him the power to jump over buildings and stuff.""

Jay: ""Or hop over them on one foot. That'd be entertaining to watch.""

As we joked about the possibilities that what we ended up calling the pointy leg, and freaked out.

Steve: ""Chill out

It worked just as well as his other leg

Chainsaw: ""So

Steve: ""We'll get you a plated loincloth with a pointy codpiece of something. Use it to impale your enemies. Or you could wear pants like Jecht did in Final Fantasy 10. One long pantleg and shorts on the other.""

As we continued to bullshit about his new super leg

Z: ""Grease slick right in front of the portal

Chris: ""Dammit, and immediately slips on the grease. He's now prone. Roll initiative.""

Once again

Steve: ""Alright

Z: ""We push it

Chainsaw: ""Uhh... alright. I'll run up behind it kick it with my demon leg so that it slides into the ocean.""

Chris: ""Roll a strength check

Z: ""Awww

Chris: ""You could run up and kick it to get the rash or something.""

Z: ""Well

Chainsaw made his rolls

Chris: ""You deftly maneuver around the grease and kick the ghoul in the... 'fucking skull

Z: ""NOPE NOPE NOPE. BACK IN THE CAVE

We agreed that now would be a good time to rest. Watch shifted around often

Z started singing the part of Sweet Child O Mine where they ask

Jay: ""We go back home

Z: ""What do we do with the magic swag? The phylacteries are in our bags somewhere.""

Steve: ""Could we use detect evil or something on them? They're bound to a Lich

Z: ""Oh God

Chainsaw: ""What if we went to a blacksmith and had him smelt it all down into ingots or something? It's being destroyed and then remade into a completely different form. I mean

Jay: ""That's a good idea

Z: ""Well, but the portal we used to get to the planes to begin with fizzled after a few minutes. We could try and find a city with a portal to somewhere in the mortal world, though. Unless the portal was two-way and we could make another and hop through that. But then we might end up in the middle of nowhere. Or...""

Jay: ""No

Heidi: ""Well then you don't have to

Z: ""Wait a second. The Nine Hells are full of Gods. And the whole of the Outer Planes... is there a God in the Hells that is a gambler or something? Can someone do a religion check?""

Heidi rolled a check, and stuff like that. But he resided in the Elemental Plane of Water. 

Z: ""OH NO. NOPE, giant squids, and scary things towards the bottom. Mother Nature threw all the stuff that was too scary for Australia to the bottom of the ocean in real life, and I'd like to think the same goes for D&amp;D. And it's in the Inner Planes, right?""

Steve: ""Yeah, anyway?""

Z: ""Well, crazy magic swag, and maybe even Godhood. And we have all of this crap to bet. If he's a God, he should be able to tell what is and isn't evil. He wouldn't take anything evil, right?""

Jay: ""What if he stacks the decks of cards

Z: ""We have a Deck of Many Things. With stakes like that

Jay: ""It only has 18 cards. And you only have 17 left.""

Steve: ""I'm sure we could talk him into resetting it or something like that. Or we could just pull from the Deck now and hope for Moon or something. And I'm seriously preferring that right now. I'll do it. Three cards. Heidi

And so Steve gave all of his stuff to Heidi

And that's where we'll leave off for now. I've felt sick twice writing this

This particular story is about a Deck of Many Things. The party here was myself as a Druid, Jay as a Rogue, Chainsaw as a Paladin, and Heidi as a Cleric. If you've been wondering as to why some of them repeatedly roll the same class, Chainsaw loves Paladins. He runs a very medieval Paladin. If someone points to a forest and asks if it's evil, you bet your sweet ass and six chickens it's evil. Heidi has a thing for Clerics, and before someone cries stereotypical female healers, despite her being a hardcore atheist in real life.

Anyway

Eventually, one of the most difficult fights we've ever been in began. There were four statues in the corners of the room. Their eyes began to glow blue as the stone began to crack and fall off of them. As Chris described what was happening, everyone went pale. Jaws and faces alike dropped immediately. We were now standing toe-to-toe with four Liches, all level 20. We were currently at 17-19, and fancied ourselves rather powerful and always prepared, but we weren't expecting this. We probably should have.

After rolling a lucky 19 on initiative

""I need a drink. Where do you keep the good stuff?""

We spent a few minutes staring into glasses of scotch, some sort of fruity drink.

Jay: ""Well

Steve: ""Yeah

Z: ""Clever idea, we'd be dodging goddamn beams of ice and thunderbolts in between sips. And for some reason, I doubt Liches would be up for a good dicking.""

Heidi: ""Well

Chainsaw: ""Pfft. Maybe you do

And with that

Heidi went ahead and used Turn Undead

Z was a horrible spell user as a Bard; he had a few healing spells and buffs

Back in Black is a pretty metal song, AC, and everything else. He just had to keep singing.

Steve, with different effects. Luckily, with the help of Back in Black, everyone avoided it.

A few turns passed with the Liches beating down on us hard, then turned to the next one.

And then Back in Black ended. And he couldn't repeat it. Z had to think of something else, the Liches turned their attention to Z, who proceeded to run around the chamber, dodging lightning bolts, fireballs, resisting several slow and silence effects. This gave us time to drop another Lich, since they were distracted.

And then one of the Liches decided that he was sick of Z's shit and used a push spell to knock him through the portal.

Without any songs, most of my clothes had silence effects cast on them, so I was nearly naked while doing my thing. Heidi was mind controlled for a round and was forced to scorn her Goddess, losing most of her powers. Steve was the only one without some kind of wicked sick status, and with the rest of the group incapacitated, the Liches were bearing down on him.

Chris opened his mouth to speak

Z: ""So

Jay: ""That was the most beautifully cruel thing you've ever done to your father. Well done. Well-fucking-done. In all my days of playing this game with your father

Eventually it breaks free from your grasp, shatters on the floor, and shoots up towards your face. The power of a God runs through your veins, and you can feel every ounce of it. You have the power to smite your foes, reward your followers

Z: ""Do I have the power to erase the memory of the two hundred people in the temple that just witnessed all of this? That'd be really convenient.""

Chris: ""Completely forgot about them. Yes, completely forgetting the events that have transpired in the past few minutes. Ormet's body has melted, leaving a wet spot in the carpet.""

Z: ""Sweet. Jedi mind trick. I want to take the deck of cards Ormet made with me. Time to head back to the castle and revive Gandalf.""

And so we headed back to the castle with our hands (well, and with after a moment of concentration, we witnessed the reforming of a soul, which was sort of like putting a broken plate back together. The color returned to Gandalf's face, and he did one of those stereotypical gasp inhales thing one does after waking up in a cold sweat.

Gandalf: ""What... how have I returned?""

Z: ""Killed a God, assuming a broken soul can go to Heaven.""

We then proceeded to explain everything that had happened to Gandalf while he ate like a pig. After having a few minutes to think about what we had done

Gandalf: ""You should not have done that. By slaying a God, luck, and trickery, but he also represented the ocean, animals in nature, and lived on the Elemental Plane of Water. That, and you may have declared war on the Plane of Water.""

Z: ""Shit. I didn't think about that. Hmmm. I'm digging the whole power thing, right?""

Gandalf: ""I do not know much of how the hierarchy of Gods works

Z: ""I'll go ask another God, let's go on an adventure! Visit the Outer Planes! See the sights and get you guys your own Gods to slay!""

Jay: ""Yeah

Steve: ""Totally. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into. Take this to a whole new level.""

Heidi: ""As long as we're avoiding the Gods Chainsaw and I worship to get our powers from

Chainsaw: ""Same here. What do we do with Triste

Z: ""I'd leave it in the capable hands of Gandalf, we'll just come back, beat 'em a little, and then go back to doing God stuff.""

Jay: ""Yeah

Gandalf: ""There's still the problem with potential enmity with the Plane of Water. They have a God missing from their pantheon. Rather

Z: ""Hmph. Well then I suppose I'll just go over to the Plane and talk it over with everyone... or we'll go to the Outer Planes and have some fun screwing up the Gods there.""

Heidi: ""You know

Jay: ""While that is a very safe alternative

And so we hopped through a portal to the base of Mount Celestia

I’ll spare you the back story but the battle began with the PCs at the edge of an orc village. The nature of their quest allowed them to either try to bargain with the Chief

The paladin steps out into the village and calls to the chief that he wants to talk and he means no harm. The chief responds by roaring and charging the paladin, he would realise that orc diplomacy is far more physical than verbal and that if he can physically dominate the chief they will have a chance to broker a deal. I explain to the entire party that when the paladin makes a check with an orc adjacent to him (not counting the chief) he takes a penalty. Then I sent wave after wave of minions at them while simultaneously conducting the skill challenge. The end result was a rather cinematic showdown between the paladin and the chief in the middle of a pitched battle. The whole party really liked it, the rogue, wizard and bard enjoyed the struggle of fighting without their primary tank/healer and the paladin enjoyed getting creative with his skill check. For example, his first move was to drop his sword and shield for an intimidate check. Then he bull rushed the chief and rolled a heal check to try and strike at weak points.

Everyone really seemed to enjoy the cinematic feel of a one on one boss fight taking place right in the middle of a larger battle. 

If anyone is curious for the mechanics of the challenge, failure turned the orc into a standard opponent who would have to be killed. I also just sent endless waves of minions at the other PCs which only stopped when the skill check ended.

TL;DR Constructed a single player skill challenge out of a boss fight for one of my players

Anyway, and the remaining two were bearing down on Steve. Chainsaw's axe was unusable, Heidi had scorned her God (which I'm going to explain more since someone commented on mind control effects,) I was naked, Jay was frozen, and Z had been pushed through a portal and hadn't come back out.

We all started swearing

Steve: ""Jay

Jay: ""Not much. I'll go over my inventory.""

Steve: ""Alright

Chainsaw: ""I think I still have that longsword I used for a while. Better than nothing.""

Now I'll explain Heidi. Gods are usually omnipotent and generally aware of what their followers were doing, wit, and faith. And so she took away her powers that required a deity. I'm pretty sure Chris was trying to kill us instead of challenging us for once.

Heidi: ""I have next to nothing. Some basic heals. No buffs

Jay: ""Hang on. I might have an idea. I have a few vials of gelatinous cube stuff. Gelatinous Cubes are essentially acidic Jell-O

Chris: ""Yeah

Jay: ""Which is why I'm gonna wing it at the back of the more back of the more banged up Lich. It'd be freaking out if its skull melted

Z: ""Wait a second. We can't just kill a Lich like we've been doing... GODDAMMIT

Jay: ""Shit

Z: ""Wait a second... what's my situation on the other side of the portal?""

At this point, craggy platform and to do an agility check to grab onto the ledge and save himself from falling into The Abyss. He made it, and started looking around.

Z: ""Every kind of perception check I can make

Chris: ""Almost forgot about him. He's on a platform below yours.""

Z: ""What's he doing?""

Chris: ""Taking a break

Z: ""How far is the drop?""

Chris: ""You're not seriously going to...""

Z: ""THE DROP

Chris: ""200 feet. If you dropped down, you probably nearly break your back and will spend a few hours wondering why you did that and thinking about how much that hurt. You'd just barely survive.""

Z: ""So the dude is stationary?""

Chris: ""He doesn't know you're there.""

Z: ""Sing whatever song I have that increases agility to help the check quietly. I'm dropping down on his head while he's stationary.""

Chris: ""Dammit... alright

Z: ""Uhhh... was this one INXS?""

Steve: ""No

Z: ""Then it's Don't Stop Me Now by Queen.""

Chris: ""Alright

Before he even got to the chorus, and a modified 29 on wisdom so he'd be able to predict when and if the Necromancer would move.

Chris: ""AND AGAIN IT HAPPENS! ... Goddammit. *Long

Z: ""YA DAMN RIGHT!""

Chris: ""However

Z: ""Can I sing something to him that gives him a bonus to make a check to survive?""

Chris: ""... You're gonna serenade the dude that unleashed four Liches on you

Z: ""Yes. The song for that one is I Love You

Everyone was silent for what seemed like an eternity.

Steve: ""You could have picked anything for that song. Literally ANY song in the world. You could have used something bolstering that encourages you. But of all the songs in the world

Z: ""Yes

Jay: ""It makes you sound like a dweeb, let me die.""

Z: ""I'll remember that."" He then started to sing, broken ribs, dislocated shoulder, legs were shattered, hardly able to speak.

Z started questioning the Necromancer in between verses. Hearing him sing this incredibly sappy song while threatening to beat him to death was golden

Necro: ""I'll tell you whatever you want if you let me go. I can summon the dead to take me away if you help me with your song. I'll stay in the Astral Plane forever. I'll give you whatever you want as long as you let me live.""

Z: ""Alright

Necro: ""There's a hidden cabinet to the right of the portal. Speak the words

Z: ""Okay. What else can you offer me?""

Necro: ""One wish. I can grant you one wish. No tricks

Z: ""Alright. Give me a Deck of Many Things.""

Everyone at the table sighed. Of all the things in the D&amp;D universe, with the power to toy with fate and destroy Gods.""

Necro: ""It shall be yours."" He used the last bit of his power to cast an Unlimited Wish spell, the Necromancer would be able to recover on his own.

Z: ""How do I get out of here?""

Necro: ""Step through the portal

Z: ""Nope

Chris: ""Nope. *Heavy sigh* I'll just assume you go back to the portal

Z: ""Naturally.""

Steve: ""Why didn't you come back and help us?!""

Z: ""It might have turned me into some kind of scary inside-out flesh beast. It still might. But I have these cards now. I'm gonna draw one.""

Chris: ""Alright, and you're going to immediately draw from it instead of going back to help them? What if you get The Void?""

Z: ""What if he lied and I'll turn into a horrible mutated mass of pancake batter when I go through? I think I've got a better chance with the deck. Get out some cards

At this point, or something else horrible would happen. Then he pulled from the deck.

He got Fates. If you don't know

Z: ""I want to chug a potion to fix my wrist

Chris: ""Goddammit... the healing potion doesn't completely restore your wrist. Instead it heals to a moderate sprain. You'll take damage if you use it.""

Z: ""Yeah

And then, unseen by the Liches. He ran over to the wall, spoke the words, smashed the bottles, and waited.

We expected the Liches to melt into a pile of nasty magical crap. Instead

Z: ""Well that's bullshit. Then again

Chainsaw: ""You think?!""

Z: ""I'm gonna grab some Tostitos and hope you guys have calmed down by the time I'm back.""

Needless to say

Now we had two super powered Liches on our hands

Z: ""Deck of Many Things?""

Heidi: ""We don't have much of a choice.""

Steve: ""Yeah

Jay: ""Who's gonna pull them?""

Chainsaw: ""I WILL PULL THE CARDS!""

Z ran over to Chainsaw. Chainsaw knew that there was a card that took away all of your worldly possessions

Chainsaw announced his intent to pull two cards...

... And that's where we'll leave off for now. I've got some stuff to do. I'll probably be back tonight for part three. I think there will be at the very least four parts

Anyway, and Chainsaw to make sure everything's accurate, because it got very confusing and chaotic at this point.

Anyway, speculate what happens, get upset that I'm making you wait again, and maybe ask Z questions in his post! Or you can insult him! His name's ZTheJerk!",,False,,1354914956.0,t3_14go1t

1.	Think about their characters a Lot. Like... way more than they probably do. Think about situations you can put in front of them

2.	Use props. If a character gets a letter, which can get a reaction from players. Once I used a giant maggot Halloween decoration as a boss fight, the players and even a nearby cat were impressed by the danger and disgustingness.

3.	Encourage people to eat and drink while they play. It gets expensive to provide food so I would recommend against buying your players dinner every week. Encourage them to have their own food

4.	Wait. At the end of the day You the DM are in charge and they came here to play Your game. If they are chitchatting

5.	Listen. Your players have a wealth of interests

6.	The rules don't really matter. In Tabletop gaming there is an infinite expanse of minutiae to the rules, is only a means to make the game run smoothly. Don't hesitate to hand wave complexity away, the DM's call is the final call.

7.	Brush your teeth. That's specific but the rule should be taken more generally than that. If you smell bad or look gross it might put a barrier between you and your players. I recognize that some people are ugly and cannot help that but there are always ways to improve your image for the players. DMing is Leadership and Leadership takes Charisma.

8.	Prepare, and a pretty good idea of what the events of the session will be. That said you should Not write out every line of dialog from every NPC ahead of time, that's constraining and will leave your players feeling chafed. Instead know the NPC feel what they might say not know what they will say.

9.	Be in the right state of mind. This is kind of a holistic thing, whatever you need to do to get Yourself in the right place. You can't get them there if you aren't.

10.	Have fun! Why the fuck are you DMing? Why are they playing? The answer should be 'Because it's fun' and if it isn't or you have a different answer then you are doing something wrong. I make it a point to try to ask at least one player after every session 'Did you have fun?' because that's the question that matters. If they say no find out why not and what would be more fun. If they say yes find out what they liked. Ask yourself the same question. Did I enjoy having them fight those whatevers? Did they?

Tonight, noise, wind, mousey hijinks, several large winged creatures, and a lot of dead people (but no bodies) 

There was also a metric fuck-tonne of dice rolled

8 Nitro-glycerin bombs were dropped onto the Zhentarim below. Almost all hit key locations, a camp holding 3000 grunts, an officer's barracks, a stable, a troll and manticore pen, and a makeshift beholder nest. The bombs each inflicted 338d6 fire damage. The gunpowder casks each inflicted 3d6 fire and 3d6 shrapnel damage.

Bomb 1 = 1180 fire and 14 shrapnel damage. Hit the clerics.
Bomb 2 = 1145 fire and 12 shrapnel damage. Hit the officer's barracks.
Bomb 3 = 1192 fire and 13 shrapnel damage. Hit the army camp.
Bomb 4 = 1198 fire and 11 shrapnel damage. Hit the wizards tower.
Bomb 5 = 1170 fire and 11 shrapnel damage. Hit the river.
Bomb 6 = 1148 fire and 7 shrapnel damage. Hit the north wall next to the army camp.
Bomb 7 = 1289 fire and 19 shrapnel damage. Hit the Beholders
Bomb 8 = 1200 fire and 10 shrapnel damage. Hit the monster pen.

The secondary damage from the shrapnel created by the blasts from the initial explosions was 5000d6

The total damage done to the Zhentarim army, was 27190 points of damage. (Which is enough to kill 81.5 Tarrasques)

The enemies killed in the blast
3000 lvl 1 soldiers = 150000xp
2 Gauths = 467xp
1 Beholder = 2800xp
5 Manticore = 875xp
10 Trolls = 1750xp
100 Horses = 438xp
4 lvl 4 Clerics = 467xp
4 lvl 4 Wizards = 467xp
1 lvl 8 Cleric = 525xp
1 lvl 8 Wizard = 525xp
1 lvl 5 Ogre Blackguard = 525xp
20 Ogres = 1750xp
1 lvl 8 Rogue Assassain = 525xp
1 lvl 8 Ranger = 525 xp

Total xp earned by each player character = 161639xp

I've been playing Asteron, a straight up evil black robed Tiefling wizard, and a gay half-orc Bard. There are about twelve of us in all, and we're a motley crew. Sometimes the group makes decisions that aren't exactly...good, but Asteron looks the other way to stay with his friends. He's only ever walked away once, when Gareth, the Half-Orc Bard and his best friend, but the fact that we didn't even TRY to save the people rankled the poor minotaur.) It's been a serious struggle for me as a player

For the last year, of the Fae, refusing to leave when her season was over. We've wanted to go after her for ten levels now, but since she's an epic level villain, the DM threw distractions like dragons kidnapping children to sacrifice to Tiamat at us. (Of course, this ended with us literally knee deep in the blood of children. Like I said, very Game of Thrones. :) )

Over the last few sessions, complete with weird NPCs and odd traps. Last session, the DM broke out a mechanic where after each action we took, we would pull a Jenga stick from a Jenga tower. If the tower fell, something pre-planned would happen, like a massive explosion or reinforcements for the enemy.

Tonight, something horrible would happen *only to the character who pulled last*. The DM didn't have to pull, and since he strongly hinted the ""something horrible"" was death, it was clear one of us wasn't making it out.

At the beginning of the session, the DM told a story about how, during his training, Asteron had become prideful about his ability to survive tests in the cold. Because of his fur, he had believed himself better than the other students, and his Master had been disappointed in him. Gareth's player had written a beautiful poem from the Summer King, trying to trick the Winter Queen into leaving of her own accord. Unfortunately, so the DM ignored the hand-written poem and had the Winter Queen attack instead. One bard alone was no match

One round passed

On my next round, he realized he should be focused on finding his friends, not helping himself. This and a decent roll got him to Gareth, who he was able to warm up slightly.

Our Goliath Warden, and sent him after Gareth and Asteron. 

With one chance, and the next thing to do was pull from the tower.

The tower was teetering. Even if I made it

I knocked over the tower.

And so Asteron died, and we all sort of grimly walked into the night.

Never lost a character before. I'm sure he'll be back, but to me, it was the only choice. I was brought up on heroes who, when presented with an impossible choice, choose the third option, even if it means sacrificing themselves.",,,,

Anyway, and kick the ghoul into the ocean. We thought about gambling with the God of luck and gambling, but he resides in the Elemental Plane of Water, and that's one big ocean. No way were we getting Z and Steve on board for that one. In the end, Steve decided that this was bullshit and he was going to pull three cards from the deck, and hope for Moon.

Steve gave all of his stuff to Heidi in case he got Talons or Ruin

His first one was Ruin, which causes an NPC friend to hate him. Luckily, everyone hates Steve anyway. His third card was Jester, which allowed him to either gain XP or take two more cards. Since we were pretty high leveled and were more worried about getting out than gaining levels, he decided to draw more cards. He pulled Talons, which makes you lose all of your magic items, but that didn't quite matter since he didn't have any. It was down to the fifth card, which increases an ability score

Steve: ""Could have been worse. Now what?""

Jay: ""We think of something else.""

Z: ""Or I give all my stuff to Steve and pull four cards.""

Jay gave an incredibly deep sigh as they did that

He picked his first card and got Comet. Comet gives you a free level if you can win the next encounter alone, we had a naked man laughing wildly as gold and diamonds proceeded to rain down from the air above him. He gave it to Heidi so he'd be able to differentiate the difference between his tower loot and this loot. 

His third card was Throne, and we could do nothing about it. His next card was Ruin, but he didn't have anything to lose, so once he was done, he took his stuff back with a wild grin.

Z: ""Well

Everyone turned to Heidi, she wanted to pull cards incredibly badly.

Heidi: ""I want seven.""

Woah. Everyone looked at each other with wide eyes

Z: ""Uhh... how about you take

Heidi: ""I'm sure. Take my stuff and give me the Deck.""

Steve: ""Hun

Heidi was paying absolutely no attention to this

As if the universe was speaking to her

Z: ""Even the Deck is trying to tell you things.""

Heidi: ""Shut up! I'm still smarter than you guys.""

She took her next card and got Fates

Heidi: ""I want to use the power of the Fates card to avoid the negative effects of The Void

Chris: ""Can she do that? I don't know if you can do that. Anybody know?""

Jay: ""Well, I'd say that it's something you can do, as long as you state it in advance.""

Chris: ""Well... alright

She pulled Jester, because her fourth card was The Void. Reality warped, and she wasn't in a coma with her soul sucked out after the card disappeared.

She laughed in a more maniacal manner than Z does

The Moon card grants up to four wishes, and had a full moon on her card; a full four unlimited wishes.

Jay: ""Wow. That's incredible luck.""

Z: ""And you thought pulling from the Deck would be stupid.""

Chris: ""She still has two more to pull. And there's still stuff in there that's no fun.""

Heidi: ""Like what?""

Chainsaw: ""I think there's one in there that imprisons you somewhere a mile beneath the earth with none of your possessions. And I don't think your wishes would apply in there.""

Heidi: ""Alright

Chris: ""Wouldn't that count as two wishes?""

Jay: ""Well, those are two totally different things. But if they're both about the same thing, I think it's just one. I don't know.""

We eventually agreed that it would only count as one wish (I still wonder if it was, and thought about how to word the wish.

Heidi: ""Alright, to be teleported to wherever Z's castle is.""

Z: ""Where is that

Chris: ""Uhhh... I don't know. It doesn't say. Since we're already fudging half of the rules

Z: ""Could I have it float above the castle of the capital city with a magical elevator leading up to it?""

Chris: ""No

Z: ""That was stupid, like the goddamn Liches that are probably still there?""

Chris: ""Uhhh... no. You can have your castle magically be built anywhere in the world

Z: ""Dammit. Then I want it to be built in a thriving city,* or do I have to put it in the middle of nowhere?""

Chris: ""*Sigh.* Fine. A castle is built within the city of Z: 'Triste!' Chris: ... Triste, with a shady part, a large market and bazaar outside of the docks, and a well-to-do sector where the nobles and mayor live, who has now given rule over to the Baron... what's your character's name? Z: 'I have no idea.' Chris: ... Alright, Baron Z, whose castle has been built next to the homes of the wealthiest nobles. I shouldn't be doing this, I don't wanna hear any complaints from you.""

Z: ""Hehehehe... you got it.""

Jay: ""You *do* realize that you've just given power over a thriving city to Z. *Z.* Allow me to state that again; *you've made Z the Baron of a city.* Does this seem like a good idea to you?""

Chris: ""No. But I've screwed you guys over a few times now

Chainsaw: ""This is awesome. Like

Chris: ""That sounds about right. Anyway

Steve: ""There are still Liches after us.""

Z: ""Where's my court mage? I need a court mage. Find me a court mage.""

Chris: ""Your castle has only the bare bones as far as staff is concerned; a system of guards

Z: ""Damn. Well

Chris: ""I don't know

Z: ""Uhhh... I don't know

Steve: ""In your bedroom

Jay: ""Wow. That's really complicated. Do that.""

Z: ""That's where my vault is. The password is known by myself, not just three random people. The password is... uhhh... Stanley Hihat Trindad, the Fourteenth.""

Chris: ""Uhhh... alright, and store it there.""

Jay: ""Where did you get that password? And why did you want the town to be named 'Triste'?""

Z: ""I'll never tell! Muahahaha!... Anyway

Chris: ""Very well. You inform your adviser

Z: ""More guards, too.""

Jay: ""Well

Steve: ""I don't know what you're complaining about.""

Chainsaw: ""Yeah man

Heidi: ""Granted

Z: ""That's what the mages are for. They'll go through the loot, and make it into other stuff. No more Liches. I need a Baroness.""

Jay: ""Why do you want a Baroness?""

Z: ""You really think I'm cut out to rule? Jesus

And that's where we'll leave off. Part 7 will be here soon

Spirit companion? Bear. The first feat you take is hybrid beast mastery as a ranger. Beast companion? Bear. For your second feat

For my next game I’m going to introduce Panda, Sasha, using an improvised hornets' nest thrown weapon. In gratitude, Sasha became my shaman spirit companion, while Brady became my ranger beast companion. As a multiclass druid, I myself became another bear, thus completing our trinity. In beastform I can use Swarming Locusts once per encounter, basically

Brady, since I favor wisdom over strength. We flank and use Predator Strike to wrack up quarry damage [1d12 + str + wis + 1d6 = 17 ave @ lvl 1]. Oddly enough that beats out my team’s barbarian/fighter, who averages around 14 with Howling Strike (unless he has rage support). With an extra 16 hp to throw around (+10/lvl), plus flanking capabilities, Brady can provide decent relief and support to any beleaguered defender.

Sasha the spirit polar bear provides my ranged capability, who takes a static -1 to attack rolls for being hybrid. Her Claws of the Eagle enables an ally to attack, then grants combat advantage, so the rogue in my party should enjoy Sasha’s aid. Meanwhile it allows Brady to attack without my presence, so I can just beat up on people at midrange with two bear fists while I chill safely with the bard, or while I sneak around with the rogue for CA support.

This build, allows for what I consider to be a complete character. You can literally be two or three places at once, and apply your actions according to the situation. Need more defender support? Brady’s got it covered, and Sasha can soak damage like no other. Control problems? Two words; hornets' nest. Need a little extra strike damage? Well hell, this build is one half striker, not to mention Claws of the Eagles’ striker enabling capacity. Leader falling short? Spirit’s Shield provides pretty solid at-will healing, while Healing Spirit and Spirit of the Healing Flood are both unbeatable options for spreading health around (and clearing minions).

The way I see it, death, and confusion. Whose spirit animal did I just kill? Was that one a player character, or a beast companion? Some may choose to hybrid shaman/druid and just be a two bear leader, while others may dabble with warden for true defender capacity. Still others might go the druid/ranger route and favor strength for some interesting striking capability. Either way, a full team of 10+ bears is versatile enough to handle any enemy threat.

So you've decided to become the DM. Being the Dungeon Master can be a challenging, and story teller. You will be responsible for knowing and enforcing the rules, and making judgements where the rules are confusing, vague, or inconclusive.

Being a first-time DM can be very intimidating. There are many pitfalls for new DMs (and even many old DMs)

**Have Fun**: There is no real ""winner"" or ""loser"" in DnD. Tabletop roleplaying games are about getting together with your friends to tell a story. You, and provide the plot. The players should feel challenged, but they should never feel that you are actively trying to kill them without a good reason. That said, you should never ""pull punches"". If the player gets unlucky and dies, that's part of the game. The possibility of death and failure are what make the challenge real.

**Say Yes**: DnD is a game, how they can do it, and what happens. However, these rules couldn't possibly include every possible situation which characters might encounter. Unless you can think of a good reason why a character *can't* do something, let them do it. Set a suitable DC, and make them roll a check. Running straight up a wall might be ludicrously hard (DC 25 dexterity maybe?), but pushing a cabinet against a door might be fairly easy (DC 12 strength maybe?).

**You are the final say on the rules, or the rules don't apply, you have the ability to change them. However, players may not like it if you run wild with the rules. The players need to know how the rules work in order to play the game. If you players don't like a ruling that you have made, avoid the temptation to say ""I'm the DM, and that's how it is"". Discuss the matter with your players, and find a good compromise. You may find that player feedback really helps you make decisions.

**Start at Level 1**: Many campaigns start above level one, it helps to have new heroes. Level 1 is far less complex than higher levels, and starting at level 1 will let you grow into the complexity as the characters level. If you and your players have a good grasp of how the game works, considering doubling xp until they reach level 2 or three. Level 1 can be fairly dull for experienced players, but this should give you enough time to get a handle on DMing.

---
**Players**

**How Many?**: There is such a thing as too many players. Historically
the DnD rules have been written primarily for parties of 4. 4th edition was written for parties of 5. In either case, four, and five parties are a ton of fun. 6 person parties quickly become a huge mess: combat takes forever, people get bored, it becomes difficult to share the spotlight. 7 is nearly unmanageable, and 8 is a deathwish. If you have 7 or more players, ask one of the other players to DM a second group. Two parties of 3 will have far more fun than one party of 7.

**Keeping Them Focused**: This is one of the hardest questions to answer. I find that it is easiest to figure out what motivates players, etc), but new players will likely be more attracted to the mechanical rewards built into the game. The easiest way to use this is to grant bonus xp/gold whenever the players successfully complete a quest. This creates a very obvious Pavlovian response which will hopefully encourage good behavior.

For those not familiar with Pavlov: Player is offered quest. His mind is immediately filled with thoughts of xp and loot

**Keep them in the dark**: Not literally; that would be silly. You don't have to answer every question you're asked, it's perfectly fine to say ""you do not know why this is happening, but it is"". Make sure that they eventually have the chance to figure it out; this pursuit of knowledge can be very rewarding.

---
**Adventures**

**Pre-written**: Don't shy away from pre-written adventures. They are written by professionals who have been in the game for a long time

Even once you've become confident as a DM, and 4th edition's pre-written campaigns starting with Keep on the Shadowfell are very popular.

**Writing Your Own**: Dungeons and Dragons is built on three ""pillars"" of gameplay: **Exploration, ideally, include a bit of each. The mix will vary between groups and between adventures, but you need a little bit of each. At the end of every adventure, the players should be able to say ""We found X, talked to Y, and fought Z"". This could be as simple as  ""we talked to mayor, and we fought the goblins who kidnapped the mayor's daughter.""

Here's a combat excerpt from my campaign, The Long Game.",szthesquid,15, convincing everyone to evacuate safely. They then attacked two of the formation's scouting parties, dangled the temporarily invisible gnome wizard out of a tree

Last night my party confronted the young white dragon that had been raiding the countryside, and set pit traps along the four roads by the village square. Luckily, the dragon landed on top of the grain silo to talk down at the party, thinking itself safe twenty feet off the ground.

The party's paladin dragonborn, as it was the tongue of the ""lesser races"" and unfit for a dragon, Kalgar was on translation duty. So Kalgar talked with the young dragon, cleverly maneuvering it into revealing its plans and motives. The dragon was pissed at being outsmarted, though, and dove off the silo to attack Kalgar.

At the same moment, launched a scorching burst at the grain silo, detonating it in a massive mushroom cloud. The dragon took nearly half its hit points in damage, but while it shielded Kalgar and Tong (the human monk) from the blast, they still took half damage, which dropped them instantly.

Now furious, who then jumped out the window while firing another scorching burst, setting off the barrels of alcohol inside the building, which funnelled the blast through the hole straight onto the dragon, which dealt another massive blow and bloodied it. Alvyn landed and turned invisible.

The dragon went into a berserker fury and charged through the inn walls after Alvyn, who was able to dodge the claws, but was stuck underneath a furious white dragon. 

Alvyn managed to get Kalgar a potion, dropping Alvyn and critting Kalgar, leaving him a single hit point away from death. 

Knowing he needed to get the dragon away from his allies before he could help, but instead it tried to force its way into the alley. The dragon was so strong that it started smashing through the walls, brute-forcing its way through with its shoulders, and ruining the houses on either side. Tong just barely managed to slip out of the dragon's reach three times, getting lucky as the destruction sent a nail into the dragon's eye, temporarily blinding it. Meanwhile, Kalgar had failed two death saving throws - one more failed save, and he'd be dead.

Tong rushed out of the alley with a fractured arm and was able to use Alvyn's potion to get Kalgar back on his feet before the dragon blasted its way back into the square, but severely injured. 

Kalgar crossed the hidden pit trap unharmed, and smacking its jaw on the edge of the pit's other side. Kalgar ran into the alley behind the inn, and the dragon pushed itself out of the pit and followed, smashing its way through the two buildings.

At this point Alvyn realized that the dragon was taking out a main load-bearing wall of the only two-storey structure in town. He fired a blast at a creaking support pillar, Kalgar threw his axe into the dragon's other shoulder, drawing it back toward the square.

I'm not sure I'm properly conveying how intense this battle was. At this point, and Kalgar is at something like 8. Alvyn's potions have all been used; Kalgar's Lay On Hands are gone; and everyone's used their second winds, so there is absolutely no healing to be had. Kalgar and Tong have each failed two death saving throws this combat, so another means death. The party is really and totally at their limit.

And the dragon is still up and charging back into the square. This time it manages to avoid the spike trap, though he's still up and fighting. 

Using phantom bolt, leaping into the air at the white dragon that looks almost like a red from all the blood. The dragon goes for a bite to intercept, but Kalgar hooks his khopesh into the dragons mouth, spins around, and lands on the back of its neck, and drives a javelin straight into its skull as he roars in triumph.

At the end of the battle, and a bunch of houses were torn apart as the dragon ripped through them. The party was completely out of resources, and one more hit on any of the characters would probably have resulted in death. Even as the DM, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

Last week, rubbed some elbows, and Saug became a level 5 commoner.  About half the people at the table like Saug, having warmed up and such.  He was no longer in chains and the bard and binder would let him eat off a plate when the psion wasn't around.  The bard also bought him a nice outfit and knitted a scarf.  I noticed the more numbers/loot oriented were not as interested in this session, so I decided to give them some goodies for the next game.

So this week, a sword', followed by 'an adamantine longsword named Ulfberht?', followed by trying to figure out who gets it.  They level 3, excluding the 'fighter' who is level 4, so this is a really upgrade.  The 'fighter' thinks it should be burned with the rest of the pyre he is building or returned to the dwarves.  The bard it all 'I am an elf, I can use it in the mean time'.  The binder is not sure what to do in terms of dividing it, the monk just want's this to end.  So two hours later

The monk says that since we can't agree on what to do with the sword, the fighter and psion agree.  They then go on, give it to him, and move on with the adventure.  Of course, Saug begins to play with it and the fighter teaches him how to use it without hurting himself.

""Careful where you point it

I quickly reply ""Saug is now a respectable member of society?"" and got a laugh.

""you will at this rate, and I decided to end it on that note.

So...that sword was a net +5 weapon.  In this world, thinking someone would at least ask why it is unique.  So now Saug has a +3 adamantine longsword of sundering ~~impact~~ collision and will probably have it for quite some time, as they will be incapable of selling it to anyone for a price the would take.

Edit: it's actually sundering collision and it's a net +6.  Oh well.

1362956072.0,1a1pmm,The Theory of Everything:  How I made sense of the insanity that is vanilla DnD,amishbreakfast,181,41,56,"If we’re going to be honest with ourselves
	
The world of Vanilla DnD is totally bananas.

So I spent a lot of time at work not doing work and trying to find a solution to MAKE it make sense.  Some grand theory to explain all the insanity.  And I have.  I present my cockamamie idea.  So I'm gonna ask myself the questions I asked myself while I was supposed to be working and then share the answer I cooked up.  Ready?

*“Why are physics broken?“*

DnD is in another universe in which our natural laws do not apply.  It looks similar but the fundamental properties of energy and matter are unique to this reality.  So forget everything you know about science.  In the world of DnD

So when you fall 80 feet, their elements are fire and water etc.  Right and wrong aren’t about philosophical discussion, they are very real, measurable, identifiable forces that govern the universe.

*“Why is this world still in the dark ages?  The timelines span thousands of years.  That don’t make sense.”*

If their version of science is magic, is the application of magic.  It’s making +1 swords and everburning torches.  The things that we have invented to improve our lives, they invented in a different way with magic.  Think Harry Potter.  They have all the same conveniences at Hogwarts, but they use a magical solution instead of a technological one.

So in DnD, just like in our world we moved over time from harquebusiers to muskets to gattling guns.  But this world lost a lot of that progress, which I’ll explain now.

*“Okay.  Dungeons.  Why are there so many of these damn things and why are they always filled with monsters?”*

Those aren’t just dungeons.  Those are bomb shelters.  See

Not everyone made it to their shelters in time.  Some shelters were abandoned or ransacked or the hibernating people were eaten by Worgs while they slept.  Some other critters moved in and called those shelters home. The surface world was insanely toxic and weird for a while and these shelters were a relief for a lot of critters.  Some got past the traps people left to protect themselves while they slept.  And they laid down a lot of traps.

 Yes

*“Explain the insanely hostile environment.  I mean

DnD world used to be like our world.  Regular animals and plants and stuff.  When the magic nukes went off it had unpredictable results.  Many animals mutated.  Now you might say, it’s magic and that is exactly how magic works.  Magic nukes produce mutants.  Deal with it.  So anyway, some panthers became displacer beasts, some geckos turned into dragons, and the radiation allowed an owl and a bear to screw and produce kids.

The weird dangerous magical radiation has only recently subsided and new mutations are becoming more rare.  It’s only been a brief time since people have gone back to the surface.  The crazy ecosystem hasn’t worked itself out yet.  It’s totally unbalanced and bizarre because it isn’t natural.  Critters are still finding their niches

*“Dwarves, etc?”*

It wasn’t just the plants and animals that got mutated.  People got mutated too.  See, but they are their own thing.  All the humanoids experienced at least a little mutation and even humans are the product of that.  That’s why we can interbreed with elves and orcs.

Not everyone pounded those sleeping drinks.  The Dwarves and Drow and other underdark dwellers have stayed awake through the entire nuclear winter and Darwinian evolution coupled with extreme magical mutation created a race that could thrive in that environment.    Orcs never made it underground.  They got mutated particularly badly and they evolved to survive the extreme conditions of the surface so now they’re like the badguys from Roadwarrior.  In the vast time that people (now mutated into new races) were separated from the rest of they world, customs, and religions.  Elves left the shelters before humans and made their homes in the forests.  The humans were the last to wake up and it’s only been a few generations.  We’re not especially suited to any one specific environment.  We were the least mutated and least specialized.  

The geography of the world has been altered by the nukes.  People don’t recognize all these new animals.  They are small communities built close to the shelters they left and they are afraid to stray far.  These are the “points of light” and remains of civilization in a totally nuts world.

*“So why are we always going into these dungeons?  And how come the entire economy seems to revolve around this bizarre activity.”*

Well, more advanced age.  Just like survivors would scrounge gas stations and armories after zombie Armageddon, the PCs are diving dungeons for the wonderful tech from the past.  These things are incredibly valuable and discovering them is in itself heroic.  It’s getting us all back on our feet, getting us back to that better world.  Finding the great science-technology and selling it is a huge help and this is a world that needs all the help it can get.

*“Character classes?  What up with that?  And why are these dungeon spelunkers almost always in groups of 4-6?”*

Clearing dungeons with armies is untenable.  For one thing, it’s hard to split a holy avenger sword between 50 guys.  So these dives are handled by small, experienced groups of professionals.

You need someone with mechanical proficiency to remove traps and unlock doors, and a magic-user who can handle all the weirdness that comes with that particular field.   Rangers, kung-fu masters, lute strumming cheerleaders, etc also come in handy.

*“I thought you said magic was like technology.  So what about Wizards and stuff?  Are they like scientists?”*

Yes.  Kind of.  You see, making potions and testing out certain magical sounds.  They couldn’t just make magic stuff happen spontaneously, just like an astrophysicist in our world can’t just wave his hand to summon a quantum singularity.  The sorcerers and wizards of today are like the mutants from the X-Men.  They were mutated and given weird powers that didn’t used to exist.  And they’re still working out all the bugs and testing to see how much they can do.  Some races are more magical than others.

So that’s it.  This little theory made vanilla DnD actually work for me.

When we last left off, but no phylacteries.

It was not until an unknown enemy began banging at the door to the top of the keep that our brains began functioning and we remembered that phylacteries can be damn near anything, and even if there was, whatever was at the door wasn't going to give us the time to.

""The banging at the door ceases as it is broken down by a monster of the likes you have never seen. It is a large, and maggots fall from open wounds as it sweeps its gaze across the room, which has filled with the scent of death.""

A collective sigh swept across the table as we reached for dice and organized our sheets. Initiatives were rolled

Heidi: ""Can I do some kind of knowledge check here?""

Chris: ""Sure. What are you trying to discern?""

Heidi: ""The basics

Chris: ""What do you mean by sentient?""

Steve: ""I think she means if it's able to think

Heidi: ""Yeah

Chris: ""Not much, if not more, intelligent than a Lich. It has some magical power, standard undead weaknesses, but is resistant to fire.""

Chainsaw: ""And what can you give *me* with a... four?""

Chris: ""Nothing

Z: ""So, angry Michael Jackson burst through the door after filming the tedious group bits of Thriller, complete with the funk of forty thousand years?""

Chris: ""... That's about the gist of it

Jay: ""What was the point of summarizing it like that?""

Z: ""I wanted a more entertaining mental image.""

We decided that since we couldn't get much

Then it came time for Chainsaw

Chris: ""After attacking the ghoul

Everybody looked at Chainsaw, causing the claymore to become stuck in the wall due to the ghoul's massive power.

Jay: ""So

Z: ""Why don't we try to look for weak spots while it's busy pulling its sword from the wall

Chris: ""You can do that

Everyone rolled, and could be broken with a strong enough hit. However, these spots were heavily armored and had few chinks in them. The frost on the ghoul's armor also appeared to have a magical property to it, and another check confirmed that failed melee attacks against armored points would have harsh consequences.

Chainsaw: ""I actually hit the ghoul

Steve: ""Doesn't matter

The information was relayed to the rest of the group

Steve: ""Wait

Z: ""Well, it's gonna go after the guys who can hit the bones most easily. I don't know about you, but I'd go right after the dude playing Legolas in the corner.""

For once, summoned beasts were knocked away, and hamstringing the thing wasn't going well, either. The ghoul simply zoned in on Steve and everything in the way was kicked, punched, or sliced out of the way.

Steve: ""Alright

Heidi: ""I think just barely 200 or something. And it doesn't seem like it's going to slow down.""

Z: ""How much does this thing weigh

Chris: ""About 1500 pounds.""

Z: ""So, a wall, it'd most likely break right through it or make it brittle enough to kick down?""

Chris: ""... I really don't like whatever it is you have planned.""

Steve: ""Well

Z: ""It's busy going after you. So what if you ran in a straight line, you'd have to outrun it since it'd be rapidly picking up speed, but you're fast. I have faith in you.""

Jay: ""That... is a really good idea. But what if it doesn't crash through the wall?""

Z: ""Well then it's still covered in grease. It might be resistant to fire

Heidi: ""Why don't we avoid torching the tower for now? It still has a portal we can use to go back.""

Jay: ""... Or to push the ghoul through.""

Chris wasn't very happy at this point. He had given us another super-tough thing to deal with, he got a Grinch-like smile on his face that curled up and everything.

Chris: ""As you diligently work away at getting the proper things set up while Steve distracts it, almost to the point of being completely white. It lets out a mighty roar, and the room's temperature drops well below freezing. Snow begins falling at a rapid rate, and you hear the beast let out a deep laugh as he begins to disappear into the snow. Chainsaw, you notice this happening but suffer no adverse effects.""

Z: ""I think I have a song that prevents weather effects

Chris: ""This is a magical snowstorm. You can't dispel or endure the effects like you could a natural one. Z, and eventually are forced to stop.""

Z: ""Can I save against it in some way?""

Chris: ""They'd have to do checks to hear your song over the wind.""

Jay: ""Where the hell did this come from? He's a battlemind

Chainsaw: ""He said it had control over some magic. I guess said magic is ice magic.""

Jay: ""But he kicked up a snowstorm and changed the room's temperature in one round. That's not just control of *some* magic. That's pure insanity.""

Heidi: ""Well

Z: ""Then the rest of its magical power is spent making itself fire-resistant. An undead ice elemental should be a boiling puddle of flesh when a fireball is tossed at it. Wouldn't this be difficult terrain for it

Chris: ""Fair point. It's slowed down

Heidi: ""Unless it can detect life, it'll have to stop the storm to be able to see us.""

Z: ""Or

Jay: ""But it would just follow us down the tower. Even if it's slow

Z: ""What if... we went through the portal?""

Chainsaw: ""And end up in the Abyss? It could just follow us through that

Z: ""But the Abyss is in Hell. And there's nothing but fire and brimstone in Hell. Or we could always pull from the Deck

Heidi: ""I'm gonna agree with him on this one. It's not in its element in the Abyss

We all eventually came to the agreement that jumping through the portal was our best bet. During our setup time while it was chasing Steve, and we'd be able to set up there.

A few tense rounds passed where we avoided it like the plague. Eventually everyone had made it through the portal

""You step through the portal and look around. You immediately question whether or not you're in the Nine Hells at all, Stygia.""

We looked at Chris

""Hey

Jay: ""Well, we're not equipped to survive this, and I don't have any ideas. And no, we're not gonna use the goddamned Deck.""

Z: ""Well, and then push it into the evil ocean where it'll be raped like a schoolgirl by aquatic tentacle monsters?""

I think we all learned something about Z that day

""You know

And that is where we will leave off for tonight. 

It was bullshit, and I might even write two if I'm feeling adventurous.

DM2 had this girlfriend, making things significantly awkward in session. DM2 was being a GREAT sport about it and still went to sessions and played with a civil manner. This is when DM1 started to become My Bully DM.

It started off in small doses. He would ""forget"" to send a text to invite DM2 to come play. He would tell GF that DM2 said awful things about her. He would pretend to not hear him when he asked a question in session.

Then it got worse. Favoritism was rampant, punish those who didn't follow his railroad by focussing unfair ammounts of fire-power against them, offer up really cool powerups to everyone but DM2, give most people sweet story-related missions...but not DM2.

Every time someone did something that irritated him he would tweet about it

ex of denying DM2 his creativity: The party must cross a canyon. My monk flies across with a rope. Everyone else has fly spells or bonuses to their jump abilities. Makes sense. DM2 plays a goliath and asks the DM what happens if he doesn't make the jump. DM1 replies, we can hold onto it while he climbs, its cool. DM1 throws a tantrum saying DM2 is trying to bend the game to his will and not following the rules.

ex of favoriting his brother: Each square is what? 5 ft? So if your character was, but DM2 is doing something (completely in character) that your character you might disagree with....do you immediately place your mini next to DM2 and say ""hey, I saw the whole thing, stop that"". No. That's meta-gaming, but DM1 has ALWAYS been turning a blind eye to this behavior.


The next stage of DM1's rule is that he started a second campaign, difficult, and he wanted something easier to handle on the side (direct quote from his twitter feed here) ""with a smaller group."" So who is in this ""smaller group""? Well he invites every player from his original group, excluding a couple who rarely make the sessions anyway, and of course, DM2. At first I didn't get an invite and this actually made me happy because it really was just a smaller group and me and DM2 could do other campaigns if need be.

Then I get an invite. Not only that, I said no, he said ok, that's fine, it'll keep the size down. 10 months later....he adds ANOTHER player. So, it's the exact same size, but he plays this group all the time.

Backtrack. Not much long after he started the second campaign he begins to tweet how terrible planning his first campaign is, but his passive aggressiveness needs work because its VERY pointed. So, I had enough and I straight up said that I wouldn't be coming to his sessions anymore. He had a fit about it, saying he feels bad about what he said and he didn't want any ""blood shed over this"". I wound up sending him a lengthy e-mail pointing out all the reasons I've stated above of why I am not comfortable playing with him anymore and signed it with ""DnD is a game, and this doesn't feel like one anymore"". 

1 Year Later.
He has been DM'ing his second campaign only, DM2, DM1's brother and GF). It's fun, but I can tell I really damaged things. DM1 doesn't look me in the eyes ever and when its my turn to do things he's noisily working on something else on his laptop and showing the SW GM this and that, taking focus from me and DM2. I don't say anything about it because I don't want to quit playing this campaign.

So anyways, and to make matters worse today's the day they're getting back into the first campaign...INCLUDING my buddy's new gf too.

I was talking to DM1's GF and (being the optimistic nice lady she is) told me to just ask DM1 nicely if I can come back if I wanted to. He's understanding, she said.

I shouldn't have been surprised that she was wrong about him. He's not letting me back due to discomfort. All my friends are playing in the campaign that got me into DnD

Am I asking for advice? Or sympathy? I don't know. I guess I just need validation that I did the right thing and a reminder that it is just a game and this doesn't dictate who I am as a person

EDIT: The trend I am seeing in your advice is that I should be moving on and trying other DnD stuff with DM2. You're all absolutely right. We've actually been toying with various campaigns with some other friends, but he's good friends with DM1, and I'm pretty sure (if the rumor is true) that they've been playtesting Edge of the Empire...which might lead to a whole new second Star Wars campaign, and the process repeats it seems. SW GM is a great guy, but I guess I haven't known him for as long as the rest. Oh well. That'll be another thing to move on from soon enough if patterns continue.

All editions

The world does not stop just because you are chasing a shiny. The army bearing down on a town moves x a day even if you are not paying attention. The bad guys continue to plot an scheme and advance their plans even if you ignore them. And if you know they are going to burn down an orphanage in x days ad you go on a dragon hunt for x+9 days letting the orphanage burn that is an evil act. There are consequences to your actions and inactions. 

3.5 

Roll 2 20's on an attack roll and its max damage. Once you have those you get a fate roll. If it comes up 20 as well it's an instant kill no matter what. (EDIT: players can save vs massive damage per the rules in the DMG with the base damage of the mobs attack take off of the roll as a penalty same goes for major NPC's. Sorry I'm a retard and forgot to include this.)

If your character gets old/dies after having a child and you reach ""epic levels"" you get bonuses for playing your child. (Bloodline of heroes

4th Ed

Powers that push the mob/player deal a d4 of damage for every square of movement they cannot complete from hitting a wall or some other object

Anywhoo look forward to hearing some of yours and hopefully I can integrate some of them into my games!

**Preface and Sample Size**

What started out as a brief thought I had regarding player alignment preference ended up as a survey.  I anticipated I'd get about 80-90 responses in a week, Survey Monkey will only show the first 100 responses to a free account, so I had to fork out $24 to get the rest of the results (up to 1,000).  I wish I could have left it open longer, but anything after 1,000 costs me $0.15 per person so I had to cut it off there.  I apologize to anyone who didn't get to answer the survey in time; it's not that I don't value your input, I just didn't want a huge credit card bill. :)  I'd like to take the time to thank everyone who answered the survey.  I personally posted this survey to /r/DnD, and /r/RPG

*(Sidenote – I was told that Google Docs will let you conduct large surveys/polls for free.  I'll keep this in mind in the future

**Expectations of Data/Perceived Sampler Bias**

My belief going into this was that I expected Chaotic Neutral to be the most popular alignment, for various reasons.

I run a homebrew classic D&amp;D game. We were about a year (real time) into it, I integrated [Thunder Rift](http://garysentus.blogspot.com/2009/10/black-sheep-thunder-rift.html) into my campaign world, and ran my group through the bulk of the published adventures TSR put out for that setting. It all culminated with the party being teleported to the other side of the world, and they have finally made it back to their home continent (and as such, back to the stuff I write instead of published adventures). 

They have completed level one of the dungeon they've currently been exploring, so I don't want to spoil it for 'em). It's written for classic (B/X, BECMI, RC), but should easily convert to whatever system you want, just insert appropriate monster stats. I've left out the intro part of it, as well, so use whatever reason fits your party/campaign to get your group here. 

Finally, change this for whatever fits your game).


**The Valdhum Mines - Level 1

[Map](http://i.imgur.com/R9mwZ.jpg)


**1.)** The walls are mostly earth

**2.)** A wooden structure has been build in this room

**3.)** This room functioned as the foreman’s office. There is an old rotted desk and chair here, a small lockbox can be found. It is locked and trapped, poisoned needle with old weak poison, 2d6 damage save for half. Inside the box is a chunk of gold ore worth 1,500gp.

**4.)** This was the miner’s barracks. Old, they will notice the spiders).

**Huge Wood Spiders (4)** : AC 6; HD 1+3* (S); hp 10, 7; MV 120’ (40’); #AT 1 bite; THAC0 18; Dmg 1d6 + poison; Save as F1; ML 8; AL N; XP 19 each; save vs. poison with +2 or take 1d8 points of damage and become sluggish for 2d4+2 rounds (-2 initiative and move half).

**5.)** This was the kitchen. Large vented fireplace in the south wall. Table with stacked pots and pans along the east wall. If anyone pokes around in the chimney, causing it to release its spores. Anyone within 10 feet of the table takes 1d6 points of damage, and must save vs. death or choke to death in 6 rounds. If the bats aren’t disturbed and the party searches, they’ll spot the mold before disturbing it.

**Yellow Mold**: AC can always be hit; HD 2* (L); hp 10; MV nil; #AT Spores; THAC0 NA; Dmg 1d6 + special; Save as F2; ML NA; AL N; XP 25.

**6.)** If this mineshaft is searched

**7.)** This mine shaft is littered with desiccated woodland animal corpses. If the party makes it all the way to the end of the shaft

**Giant Hunting Spiders (8)**: AC 8; HD 2 (M); hp 13, 10, 8, 8, 7, 7; MV 120’(40’); #AT 1 bite; THAC0 18; Dmg 1d6; Save as F2; ML 7; AL N; XP 20 each.

**8.)** Leading up to this area the party notices a strong odor of death. When they enter

**Bear

**9.)** A small band of goblins has taken this small area as their lair. The entrance has a small, “Back off, woodsmen, this is our home now. You have your own place!” If the party talks to the goblins, they’ll learn that the mines don’t extend much past this area, the goblins have been here for about 5 years and keep to themselves, and that if the party is looking to explore the mines, the goblins will fight to defend their home.

**Goblins (20)**: AC 6; HD 1-1 (S); hp 4 each; MV 90’ (30’); #AT 1 weapon; THAC0 20; Dmg 1d6 (spear); Save as NM; ML 9; AL C; XP 5 each.

**10.)** Small piles of goblin bedding line the hallway leading to this area. This is where the goblins keep their “hoard.” There is a total of 10gp, and a large (2’ long, 4” diameter) wooden rod (used to operate the elevator in area 11).

**11.)** The whole northern wall is made of cut stones. The ceiling in this area is taller than in the rest of the place, leads upwards from the ceiling. If the party searches, they’ll find a 4” diameter hole in the wall. The wooden rod from area 10 fits in this hole, and when the lever is pulled, an elevator will drop down from above. When the lever is pushed back up, the elevator lifts. Note that players will have to push the lever up and get on the elevator, leaving the rod behind and in the up position. The lift goes up about 50’. About halfway up, they will come retrieve the lever after the party uses it

After another day of taking her shit about how freaky DnD is, because, honestly, she didn't have a fucking clue what she was talking about. Of course, she refused. But then I told her, that DnD is basically the same as her favourite games on the ps3, namely Fallout 3, you have perks (feats) that you gain more of as you level up and you have skills (e.g. lockpicking in Skyrim/Fallout etc) that you can also improve when leveling up. Just like in Fallout

Hence, I could tell she was even looking forward to it. When we were making her character, she really did a bad job at hiding her excitement, as she spent hours finding pictures of a female Tiefling Warlock (she picked Tiefling immediately because they looked 'sexy and evil') and creating her personality traits and mannerisms and the like. She even came up with a pretty elaborate backstory, namely that she was abandoned in the fey woods as a baby and was adopted by Eladrin who taught her the ways in magic. However, she was also constanly mocked by the 'arrogant' high-elves and, when she was 18 she even killed an Eladrin out of rage after being mocked by him. Thus she got banned and had to live alone in the woods for 2 years where the rest of the adventurers party pick her up and the adventure begins. She also said, I was still really proud and happy that she put so much effort into her character

When it came to actually playing the game, because I had to explain to her how combat/powers work and what she could do or not do and that she could pretty much try anything she wanted and I as the DM would try to incorporate it into the story some how. Also the amount of Roleplaying was a little bit too much for her at the beginning:

When the other party members met her character for the first time this conversation happened: My friend's Dragonborn: ""Watch out, hiding in the woods!"" After approaching her character and seeing it was a Tiefling ""A Tiefling? Here in the woods? How did an individual of your brave and tenacious race find its way into these elven woods?"" My girlfriend stared at my friend playing the Dragonborn, then at me and finally asking ""What do I say?"". I responded ""Whatever you like! You have a backstory, choose to share it or not. Lie or tell the truth, whatever you want."" She looked at me with a hint of panic in her eyes and said ""You told me it was gonna be like Fallout! In Fallout you get to choose what you want to say from preset options...I want that!"". Ahh, cute. After explaining to her that it was one of the best things in DnD that you can literally say and do whatever you want - if you're willing to face the consequences - she eventually explained to the other party members why she was living in the forest and so on; still some conversations were a little stiff (""So, Eilatra the Wild, but as time went on she really got the hang of it. The things she enjoyed most was messing with the people in the towns, Bluff and stuff like that

After we ended the session and went home together she wouldn't stop talking about how she didn't like the Eladrin party member

As for myself, it's our human forces (and some gnolls we tricked with meat and prestidigitation) vs. a giant fortress of orcs, ogres, and some mages.

We sneak some people inside as ""prisoners"" and tell the king of the orcs, motherfucker's name was Doom-Axe, tells the king that he'll fight their measly human champion.

In comes Stanley Yelnats

I start marching across the field toward the fortress with the giant orc waiting outside. I know that their siege weapons can obliterate me with magic in an instant

I get to 60' away from Doom-Axe and we roll for initiative. I go first. I immediately whirling frenzy AND frenzy, dropping him to 2 hit points in my first charge. I use my Intimidating Rage and manage a high roll, which is probably what saved my life.

What proceeded was perhaps the most aggravating thing I've ever gone through as a player of d&amp;d. I'm at 67 health to start, and again for 15, bringing *me* down to 2HP and things are looking desperate because he's healing as he strikes me down. Until he rolls a NAT 1 and critical misses, sending his axe into the dirt 15 feet away.

I remember I have improved trip.

I hit his touch and send him sprawling

Somewhat drunk and incredibly frustrated, and they are fickle mistresses. ""I spent money on you!"" I tell them. I say that they're special, that I won't roll any dice but them for as long as I live. Just get Stanley out of here alive! I prostrate myself and let the dice fly.

NAT 20. 

I confirm that x4 crit. 

It was enough damage to send him to -4 from full health. His wounded

I bring my scythe down through the top of his helmet, roaring my battle cry atop the pile of flesh.

I grab the axe from the field and sprint back to the defensive line around the fort

turns out Doom-Axe was a level 12 Fighter at that point in combat. Stanley's first kill got him a level.

1370069528.0,1fgcsb,Tired of one-dimensional Dwarves? I wrote an alternate history/breakdown! (Warning: Long),eL_Jacho,149,29,17,"Dwarves and legends around them have existed for time immemorial.  Foreign, the Dwarf-founded city states pride themselves on being heirs to the greatest lineage in history.

Dwarf societies are difficult to measure in longevity due to inaccurate or a total absence of record keeping as well as how damn dangerous the Underground is.  What is clear is that many of the oldest tunnels Underground that still function all appear to be hewn in a similar fashion and were all marked with a form of stone writing that has been lost for millennia.  Unlike other ancient societies, which means “Explorers” in ancient Dwarven.

What is known with certainty is how Dwarves were the first (to the best of regional academia’s knowledge and many are—coincidentally—Dwarven) to establish sustainable city-states in a style similar to that of surface societies.  After learning to master underground beasts that could be harvested for meat and farming fungal sprouts and edible plants that feed on chemosynthesis

“Race, elves, gnomes, and species of every kind that can talk have found themselves in a Dwarven city once or twice, though often not willingly.

“The Dwarf Trade” refers to the chain of commerce that connects some of the deepest places underground with the highest mountains on the surface.  In fact, the Dwarf Trade is typically avoided in polite conversation on account of half of it being supported by the backs of slaves.

“Hostage” derives from the Dwarf word “Hlosdaagi” meaning “chained guest.”  Throughout history

The largest problem arose with the arrival of a massive Drow Exodus from the surface spearheaded by a military commander known as Lilith or Lolth.  An apostate Cleric of the God of Elves, bloody fighting between Dwarves and Drow that ended with the signing of the “Charter of Personage,” which outlined territories, rights of negotiation, and prisoner exchange between warring cities regardless of differing racial demography.  It was this formal “Exchange” that formalized captured people of all races as things to be quantified, borrowed, and used for profit.

The Charter of Personage started a tradition where Dwarven and Elven miners, as is the case with slaving societies overcrowding can be a serious issue, so when an overabundance is reached the crowded city will have a “sale” and massive numbers of people will be traded to neighboring cities (Dwarf and Elf alike) and hostages can be returned to their homes or—if no one is there to claim them—they are sold to someone else.  Whenever the Charter is honored Elves and Dwarves in the Underground profit immensely from it, and for this reason many Dwarf and Elf cities have better relations than more homogenous and less “business savvy” allies.

It was also this business relationship that led to the start of a new species and society altogether: the Duergar.  Known to non-local peoples as “Deep Dwarves,” Duergar originally entered the fold as half-dwarf, half-drow offspring produced by the many hostages in Dwarf and Elven cities alike.  To maintain cultural traditions and avoid an unseemly union between two groups who were [officially] political enemies, Duergar origins are flatly denied by almost everyone in power, even if it’s painfully obvious as to how they got there.  While they received markedly less discrimination in many Drow cities, Duergar were nevertheless denied full citizenship on account of them only being partly Drow.   While—to this day—Duergar districts are a hallmark of any Dwarf or Drow City, most of the outcast Duergar fled to the Underground and journeyed into even harsher climates and founded cities of their own called Bulwarks.  A steady rise of Duergar Bulwarks with prominent armies has forced many Drow and Dwarf politicians to push for more rights and privileges for Duergar citizens to help stave off an outright war or uprising.  The last thing Drow or Dwarves want is an assault in their backyard from their actual relatives

Another matter for contention exists between the Dwarves and the Gnomish Principality of Yallerwust.  Famous for its isolation and secret trade routes that were almost as valuable as the goods they carried, and the Illithids realized that Gnomes—above any other race—could survive handling the poisonous material better than anyone.  The mining always poisoned the blood and left many mentally feeble afterwards, but a Gnome’s innate resistances allowed them to mine for more than triple the time any other intelligent race could survive the extraction process.

Dwarf and Drow cities have few official public relations with Illithids on account of their negative reputations, Ysolde declared war on the Dwarf Trade itself and began financing a vicious guerilla war against any and all slave traders.  Ysolde even started backing Drow and Dwarf politicians to push harder for an end to the Trade as well as the vicious caste system.  After hearing of Ysolde’s declaration, Goldvayne has called for a Charter Council to convene and strike the entire Gnome race from the Charter of Personage and brand them as “not trade-worthy.”  

**A Silver Lining**

Now, Underground labor, many Northern enclaves simply purchase grain and food from the surface and forego inducting a Hostage caste altogether.  To many dwarves in these regions, the Hostage system itself is often scorned on account of its potential for brutality and political unease.   While outspoken, these mountain holds are typically poorer than their southern counterparts (and gain most of their money from trading Southward goods with on the surface), and thus have less influence during Charter Councils.  As one Charter master representing some southward Dwarves remarked, “If you find our standards beneath your sun-burned standards

Given the nature of traditionalism and the solidarity among Underground cultures, the common word “discipline” comes from the dwarf phrase “Descurn ip-Allyn,” meaning “Acting as one Must.”  The phrase has become so common that even the Drow have a similar phrase “Yishil Solla ru hin Durakka” roughly translated as “Dwarves don’t hold their lines for stupid reasons.”

**Charters and Kings**

Royalty is more common in Northward civilizations and less and less common the farther southward one travels Underground.  While the very old cities like Goldvayne do have royalty descended from ancient lines, the Charter system became popular for its speed in action as well as its consensus from the majority.

When a Judge or Lawgiver expresses a formal NEED, as income and resource allocation are all spelled out in the charter before it’s signed, and any Charter House will display its contract in a special room specifically for business and prospective employees called a Daimont.  Kings and royalty never got the foothold in the early Dwarven societies that surface cultures did, and because of this many Dwarves (especially Southward Dwarves) view powerful monarchies with suspicion and lack of oversight.  In almost every Dwarven city there exists a council where representatives of each charter convene to discuss tactics and encourage cohesion, and these representatives are called Charter masters.

As was previously mentioned,” so they can negotiate with other charters abroad for better trade or military assistance.

Because of frequent military conflict and high exchange of hostages, two feuding states might exchange royal family members as Honored Hostages for decades at a time.  In some cases, Drow cities have been known to hire entire Dwarf Charters to bolster their forces either to fend off enemies or smooth over a military junta.  What’s more, it’s actually a sign of high status among Dwarves and Drow to have a high ranking official of the opposite race serve as an attendant.  

tl;dr Dwarf society is incredibly complex, and filled with varying degrees of awe and horror that perfectly reflects the environment in which they thrive.

I'll put a comments down below of his reactions to various comments on his antics and a few of my own questions for him

There were a few comments on part 13 about dropping Steve's God into a fissure, and after he nearly killed Steve with a nut shot, there was no way I was going to put up with his shit."" I'd also like to clear up that there were a few other checks; the dropping of the gold counted as a compel effect, being covered in oil gave him a penalty to not falling in, and another penalty to holding on when he did fall in. He had another save that would have enraged him, where he would have climbed right up the cliff and most likely pounded us to dust. There was another check against confusion or something like it, where he would have noticed he was about to fall into the bowels of the earth and done something about it. I believe there was also another check for ""swimming"" over to the cliff wall for a second chance at a grab and climb check. (Though that might have been tied into the last one I mentioned.) The dice were against Chris

And if there was any potential confusion about exactly how he split the ground open, and he would have lost a few turns after it. They were literally banking entirely on this working, and it did. They were lucky bastards.

Anyway, and Steve had joined Z and Chainsaw in their Godhood. We were rolling off on who would go next, and it was Jay's turn to pick a God to slay.

Chris: ""Alright, but I don't want any more meetings out of game to do shit like that. That was a load of bullshit and the both of you fucking know it.""

Z: ""I don't think I've ever heard that many vulgarities out of you before.""

Z: ""Maybe it is.""

Jay: ""Three turns max and whatever God I pick is down.""

Z: ""Throw a dart at a piece of paper listing the remaining Gods and I'll put $100 on it.""

Jay: ""Deal.""

The list was made and tacked to the dart board. We blindfolded Jay and let him throw. And then the unthinkable happened. He took off his blindfold after throwing the dart

Asmodeus.

Jay: ""NOPE. Take the Benjamin.""

Z: ""I don't want it until you've led us down to the bottom layer of hell to fight him. You can give it to me after he rips your face off.""

Steve: ""Is Asmodeus even statted? I don't think anyone would be dumb enough to fight him. Doesn't his blood turn into pit fiends or something?""

Chris: ""Yeah

Jay: ""Shut up and take the money. I'm not fighting him. No way.""

Z: ""Alright

And once again he was blindfolded and tossing darts. Erythnul.

We trekked our way to a massive mountain thingy, and dexterity checks, we made it to a small platform. After the last of us had climbed up, Loki faded into view.

Jay: ""Nope. We're coming up.""

Chainsaw: ""He's probably an illusion. The real Loki's probably jerking it at the top or something.""

The shade of Loki scowled and disappeared.

Z: ""Yeah... I don't like that.""

Steve: ""Me neither. That's... not good. Not good at all. He knows we're here now

Chris: ""As you debate what to do in this situation

**The poll is closed

~~This poll is directed at people who have played as PCs; if you've only ever DMed and never been a PC

I'd appreciate it if you could take a few seconds to answer the following questions on the poll:

1. Which of these alignments have you played as in the past? (Multiple selections allowed)

2. Which alignment is your PREFERRED alignment to play as? (Pick one)

3. (Optional) Is there any reason you lean towards playing the alignment you selected in Question #2?

4. Are there any alignments which would interest you

Many campaigns flirt with alternate realities

Deja Vu encoutners are when you run the PCs through a series of events that they've experienced before

So here's what you do. The PCs approach a [dungeon/temple/space ship/whatever]. They are stopped just outside the temple by a barrier and a voice. ""Help me

The PCs will be baffled and probably think this is some kind of riddle. They cannot successfully answer the question. After a few moments of trying the voice will give up in despair and the barrier will go away.

The PCs enter the structure and see a big-bad boss guy guarding whatever Macguffin the PCs are currently seeking. Near the boss is a prisoner of some powerful race (angels are good to use here). The boss monologs for a few moments and calls out ""[Name of prisoner]! Destroy these fools!"".  The prisoner reluctantly follows the orders as they are compelled to do and combat begins.

Part of the combat should involve deadly traps that activate on certain squares and stealthed enemies that attack from surprise. This should be a hard battle. If you're doing a dream sequence you can even TPK the party here.

The PCs win or lose and go to get the MacGuffin but something happens. A time flux

Next week you come back and the PCs are confused as to what exactly happened on that space ship

If the PCs are lucky

They say the name of the prisoner and enter the structure again. Combat will happen again, and they know about the stealthed monsters. 

This is especially good way to let the players ""redeem themselves"" if you TPK'd them the first time. With the prisoner on their side and knowledge about the traps and stealthed monsters the PCs should be able to overcome the challenge. If you TPK them again

We were early in our campaign, which we accidentally succeeded in doing. We found her bound and gagged inside a cave surrounded by four Tiefling Rogues, and battle was soon joined. Thanks to some quick thinking, and a few lucky rolls, we quickly dispatched three of the four Tieflings, and we had the last one surrounded. Now here is where the magic started:

DM: ""The Tiefling realizes he is screwed

Cleric: ""Wait

DM: ""He saw what you did to his friends

Fighter: ""Ah man

Me: ""...Does a Coup de grâce provoke? That provokes

Laughter around the table.

""No

DM: ""Wat. Why?""

Me: ""Non-lethal

DM: ""Ok, so I really doubt...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20.

DM: ""God

I roll again, with the Tiefling having 14 AC, as we had learned earlier.

DM: Darn

Fighter: ""No no

DM: ""That still gives him 13

Fighter: ""Bless."" The DM had apparently forgotten the Bless spell cast at the beginning of the fight

DM: ""Fine, so I doubt-""

Me: ""8. Max damage

DM: ""...I hate all of you.""

So we bound up the Tiefling with the ropes from the princess

DM: ""Alright, there are Tiefling-eating bears in these woods...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20 from the Fighter.(We had a home-rule that a natural 20 meant automatic success on skill checks

The DM was silent for a second

Me: ""I check the Tieflings mouth.""

DM: ""What? Why?""

Me: ""The tiefling just bit his own tongue off so we can't take him alive

The DM was silent. That was in fact exactly what had just happened.

After a quick healing from our Cleric (We decided that we shoved the tongue back in the mouth and healed the wound) the party realized we had a few options here: We could either make a contraption of a gag so that the Tiefling couldn't bite his tongue but could still breathe; we could have the cleric walk behind him constantly casting Cure Minor Wounds (in Pathfinder level 0 spells can be cast as often as you like) so he couldn't bite through his tongue again

Cleric: ""We are next to a river

DM: ""Yeah

Cleric: ""Are there reeds growing there?""

DM: Yeah

Cleric: We could preform a tracheotomy! That way

The DM was aghast

And thus ended the one and only story of competency that our group had.

**To put this post into perspective** 

If you don't care what games i've played or what background i have regarding gaming

I've GMed various versions of D&amp;D and AD&amp;D pretty heavily from 1982 starting with this [book](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rYv4hYxPiKg/UQQQv3Cc5XI/AAAAAAAABvk/Ln2MOpap2f8/s1600/moldvay-basic1.jpg) to about 1995-ish, and sitting down to run 3.5 was too much like going to work for me. It was kind of hard to avoid the various chatter online about 3.5, though, so i have a fairly good handle on how the game worked overall.

I bought a bunch of stuff for 4e, overall, but I'll be honest, tieflings and eladrin and dragonborn and a bunch of the other stuff in the game didn't really resonate with me. I really like the Eberron setting though, go figure.


I have also run numerous other games over the years ranging from Call of Cthulhu, Star Frontiers, GURPS, Cyberpunk 2020, The Riddle of Steel, some Palladium games like Robotech, and, a bunch of other stuff that isn't immediately leaping to mind. That's just the stuff i've run; i've owned a ton more stuff

Anyway

I haven't actually physically playtested D&amp;D Next yet. I would like to

I'm not coming from this game with grognard colored glasses, and double weapons are  a seriously fucking retarded idea.""


**System**

I read the various pdfs basically in order that one would read them if they picked up a game book: ""How to Play""

The text needs to be tightened up and clarified a little bit


The system has kept the core that made 3.5 great

The advantage/disadvantage mechanic is brilliant

I expect people who get off on all the adding and subtracting and the granularity of d20 based systems aren't going to be happy about this mechanic.  In play, this mechanic looks to me like a good thing.

I'm a little annoyed by Dex being your basic stealth modifier even if you're just hiding behind a big rock

*Combat*

I'm breaking this out separately

I'm super happy to see a giant grid isn't necessary to run a combat any more. The action mechanic set looks comprehensive and robust without being bogged down in minutia

I'm annoyed that opportunity attacks are still around. It's a dumb mechanic that just punishes players for having an unlucky combat round and turns fights into a static slog because nobody wants to move for fear of an opportunity attack


The resting rules and their options make for a nice balance of the 4E healing surges and the 1E ""it takes days or weeks to recover"" mechanics.


**Character stuff in general**

Overall

The stat bonuses for choosing a particular class just makes sense

*Backgrounds and Specialties* 

I like these. I like this a lot. Mmmmhmmm. It's about time stuff like this showed up. It's only been 34 years since Traveller raised the torch on this.

Now, the concept and implementation of differentiating my fighter from Joe's fighter with a background and a specialty instead of digging through a mess of convoluted and often broken feats really appeals to me. It's not revolutionary, of course; there was nothing to prevent anyone from saying ""My fighter is a soldier"" in any previous edition of the game, but having it front-loaded and baked in provides a wonderful level of focus for people who are new to the game, and also provides some neat role-playing hooks right out of the tin without having to require the DM or the player to spend a lot of time on it.

*Feats*

Feats are a great idea in theory. In 3.5, were mainly chosen for their mechanical benefits rather than any other consideration, and so between that and feat-bloat, i never really liked their implementation. 

The feats they have in the playtest are generally nice and flavorful, but that's fine for now.  The optional rule for ""you can choose feats outside your specialty"" also allows for some really interesting class options, like rogues that know a couple of cantrips to help them be extra awesome. I expect them to add more, of course, but hopefully there won't be 8 billion of the damn things six months after release.

*Alignment*

I've gone back and forth in my head over the necessity of having alignment over the years. These days

**Races**

Good stuff, i'm glad they brought those back. I think humans might be getting a little bit of the shit end of the stick here (i honestly have no better ideas though), but i don't think the other races significantly overpower them. I do miss the half-elf and half-orc, but i imagine those should be coming at some point.

**Classes**

I like what they're going overall with the class system in this edition. I'll just talk about a couple

*Fighter* Damn son

*Barbarian* Ugh, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5ss7z), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5t7iu). **EDIT 2**: And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5x8hm) a whole bunch more). I've never liked the barbarian class, even back in 87 with Unearthed Arcana hit the shelves. It's always been a dumb class (at least in UA it had a little flavor), with a dumb gimmick (""[rar me so angry!](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/3376039680/h1DB95A57/)""), and D&amp;DN hasn't fixed that. I seriously hope this class is still in alpha. Not that it really matters to me at the end of the day, i'm just banning the class because i think it's that dumb. 

*Rogue*  Schemes are awesome. That's all i need to say about that. It always bothered me that thieves basically turned into sneak attack machines post 2e

*Monk* I've always liked the monk. In 1E, but also some cool flavor (quivering palm, anyone?). The class right now definitely needs work, but they're going in the right direction here, i think.

The rest I'm pretty satisfied with conceptually and mechanically overall. Minor tweaks here and there




**DM stuff**

Aww yeah, i could ignore all that stuff other than the stat blocks, but the fact that the designers thought ""we don't trust the DMs of our game to create encounters properly"" was...well, insulting.





**Overall feel and final thoughts**

Having equipment measured in weight

This game just feels like old school D&amp;D, transparent and robust system that won't choke under it's own weight.  It doesn't have that ""you need a mechanic for everything ever"" feel. I don't know why they didn't do this a decade ago. Or half a decade ago, for that matter.

I get the impression that if you want the crazy gonzo shit that 4E turned D&amp;D into

I also get the feeling that i can add or take away as I see fit to the ruleset without having to worry too much about random

I seriously feel like i could run this game again without having flashbacks to corporate tax return schedule 2011 T2 Sch1. I mean

I would be pretty happy to play this game in it's current playtest incarnation. It's not perfect yet

1. Stay engaged no matter what, and make note of all the little things your character would actually be doing. As an example don't just say you set up camp, actually go through the motions involved in doing so you don't have to do it every time but try it at least once for the experience.

2. Take a psych test in character

3. Give what your character says context don't just ""How are you today."" smile as you say it add an excited tone of voice reveal the kind of person your character is by showing us the kind of emotion they put behind their words.

4. The DM doesn't need to be there for you to role play, or better yet just try shooting the shit in character.

5. Remember it is and isn't a game. We play to have fun but at the same time you're not. The best role playing is done when for brief amount of time you become another person

I'm running a party of five 2nd-level characters (3.5) plus one 2nd-level NPC cleric. Most of the players are relatively new to the game

There's one character in particular that I need to flesh out for you before telling the story. He's a halfing monk with severe ADHD. The player has been roleplaying the character exceptionally well; he actually makes regular rolls to check what his attention-deficient response to any given situation is

We've been making our way through one large underground complex for quite a while

So anyway, so I had strongly encouraged them to head back and rest up in safety before continuing. They decided to go ahead and delve deeper into the dungeon instead. Knowing what was coming, I immediately feared for all their lives. 

We left off last time in a large room with a spiral staircase leading down a hole in the center of the floor. They went down (finding a disabled trap along the way) and found themselves in the middle of an enormous room- 40-ft high ceilings with luminescent fungi everywhere and a deep layer of rotting compost on the floor. There they met 4 twig blights and 4 skeletons skulking around and tending to the accumulated compost. For the sake of space

Now there was a large cave mouth in the north wall which led to the residence of an absolute beast of a bugbear (heavily armored lvl 4 fighter/barbarian with excellent melee feats wielding a two-handed morningstar). The original idea was that he and his two well-trained (and HD-advanced) dire rats would come investigate the sounds of battle during the third round of combat in the main room. I rolled up on my decision tree that he happened to be asleep when the battle started, so they were aware something was up and were ready for trouble. 

Now they're standing in the middle of the room watching the cave mouth when this horrendous seven-foot tall creature decked in full battle regalia (stag horns for a hat, telling them to, ""Get ready for the stewpot!"" I mean to this party, dude was SERIOUSLY scary. They've hardly encountered anything bigger than a goblin before. I'm talking TPK in 6-7 rounds of melee if it operated at the peak of its abilities (and it was certainly smart enough to do precisely that).

The players debated for a bit (I always let them discuss strategy and tactics out of character

The little monk, but had to play inside the bounds of his character's weakness (if only all players would operate that way... *sigh*). He fortunately realized his mistake before actually reaching the baddies and turned to run back toward the stairs- the rats caught up with him, but both missed their trip attacks and he slipped away cleanly. He started up the stairs and had the presence of mind to lay some caltrops (which he had cleverly decided to pick up earlier in the dungeon) behind him to slow any pursuit.

Both rats and the big guy missed their intelligence checks to not go barreling up a narrow stairway in pursuit of a large party; they also missed their spot checks for the caltrops, given the whole ""metal spike in foot"" situation). He knocks one rat off the staircase to its death, and the other two finally make their percentile roll to give up the chase and head muttering and grumbling back towards the cave, glad to have chased the intruders away. (The monk can't see them at this point since he's retreated high enough that the stairs below him effectively block his view.)

The rest of the party, abandoning the rogue (remember him?) to his fate, hoping his hide skills were up to the task.

Now all this time said rogue had been silently slipping down the eastern wall to get in position for- *BAM!* ranged sneak attack right as the big baddie is dealing with the caltrops wedged between his toes. Significant damage from a bolt in the back. Mr. Big is too angry and hurt to find the source of this new irritation

The monk can soon see the enemy heading back towards the cave, who's most of the way to his cave by now, of course notices the commotion and comes rushing back with a renewed rage. ""How dare they continue to harass me after I've chased them away,"" he thinks. He charges up the staircase at double speed (I judged that a spiral stair could approximate a straight line since he used his hand to anchor himself to the central pole, using it as an axis of rotation (yes, I know, but it was cool and the DM has discretion, so the bugbear just whizzed right past him on the way up. Attack of opportunity missed

Then the monk comes up with an absolutely batshit crazy idea- he's going to try running up a staircase with no rails to jump on the bugbear's back while said creature is fully twice his size and has disrupted balance due to his injured feet. Mr. Halfling makes his balance check to run up, well, I'm not sure exactly what. Problem is, his new mount fails its own balance check and begins to fall back down the stairs. Our super-duper halfling monk leaps off (with a grossly successful tumble check), but then lands too close to the edge of the stairs and teeters precariously over it. Nope. Balance check failed. He immediately tries to catch himself- reflex save made, but then the strength check to hang on just isn't quite good enough. Nearly thirty feet to the bottom, and only ten HP to spare. I give him a little credit for slowing his fall by grabbing out for the ledge, smoothly rolling as he hits bottom- 3d6 falling damage

The bugbear, I might mention). It lands prone on the ground, injured from the fall, and as it shakily rises to its knees our sneaky rogue, who's been withholding his action the whole time, pops up with his readied sneak attack. His  javelin flies true and plants itself firmly in the monster's ear. The horrid creature slowly collapses into the dirt, its lifeblood quietly oozing out of its cracked skull. The other rat (who somehow failed multiple spot and intelligence checks to deal with the party or at least run away) was easily dispatched with a couple crisp ranged attacks as it wandered back to the cave.

Victory accomplished. *Cue halfling success kid.*

Sorry for the enormous wall of text; thank you if you took the time to read all the way through. Please ignore all the tense shifts and pronoun errors- I'm way too tired to work it all up properly.

Anyway, Loki had appeared before us and told us to get the hell off of his mountain! Naturally we told him to shove it, which caused, in Z's words, ""A massive HF-spitting Sephiroth bug"" to break through the mountain. Would Steve's utterance of the possibility of a Jenova bug completely screw us over?

Initiative was rolled, with Heidi managing to move before everyone else before the Sephiroth bug made its assault.

Heidi: ""So what do we do with this thing? We don't have much room to maneuver. We're on a tiny outcropping.""

Steve: ""I don't know

Chainsaw: ""That's probably the most sensible idea until we figure out whether or not we can even get through its chitin.""

Z: ""What are its feet like?""

Chris: ""They're like stilettos. Just sharp

Z: ""Alright

Steve: ""Why not thunderfuck it or something?""

Z: ""If I know Chris as much as I like to think I do

Jay: ""Woah. The evil mastermind's stumped?""

Z: ""I'm not stumped

Jay: ""Fair enough.""

And so the fight began. Buffs were placed, placing a countdown on how long the platform would hold. Chris had it go straight for Z, and managed to hit him for quite a bit and give him a hell of a poison.

Z: ""Hmph. Only took you the better part of two sessions to get some damage in. God liver engage!""

Chris: ""Nope. This creature is accustomed to clashing with higher beings

Z: ""This dance of ours will end one day. What does it do?""

Chris: ""The poison is unique in the sense that it does not cause any damage

Eyes widened to the size of saucers. We all looked at each other with an

Steve: ""Most of us are Divine. Chainsaw, and Heidi. Your time to shine, boy wonder.""

Z: ""Why must I always think of everything? ...Hide me somewhere and petrify me. The poison won't survive if I'm made of rock. Then remove the petrification. No more poison. But keep that thing away from me. It still spits the most powerful acid known to man.""

Steve: ""Atta boy. I'll petrify him. Heidi

""Hard"" does not even begin to describe the difficulty of this fight. The beast had a massive AC. Spells bounced right off of it. It could act more than once in a turn. However, nobody was winning.

Chris: ""As the battle rages on in favor of no particular side

For the first time in a while, and Z were looking at each other, eyes darting back and forth at one another. It was like they were having some kind of conversation with just their eyes.

Chris: ""The level of silence over there is unnerving. What are you bastards up to?""

They completely ignored him and continued doing this for a few more minutes. They nodded and turned back to the rest of the group.

Steve: ""We're gonna call out the bug on being Loki. I don't know why we didn't think of this before. God of trickery, now.""

Z: ""It would take eons of evolution for this thing to be able to stand up to a God. Everything else that wasn't a God that we've fought here dropped like a fly. As far as we see it

Jay: ""We guarantee you he's secretly been taking a pounding underneath that thing. I believe perception or insight would be the right thing to use.""

Chris kept his cool and let them roll. You can't just detect the God of trickery like that, shit-eating grins.

Chris: ""I really didn't think you'd think of that... well done. You look hard at the Sephiroth bug and determine that it is

Z: ""I fucking knew it. We were rolling against Loki and you were saving against the damage to keep the illusion going and looking unharmed. You clever bastard

They spread the news to the rest of the group, he's not exactly the toughest God, so we beat him heavily until he was unable to move. It was a bit like the Avengers when the Hulk slammed him on the ground repeatedly.

Z: ""All you

And so Jay curb stomped the God of trickery, Chris interrupted.

Chris: ""Very well done. But if you know the Norse legends of Loki

Chainsaw: ""Well

Heidi: ""Fly?""

Chris: ""Certainly doable

Heidi: ""Then we shall Fly!""

And so we flew up, towards the mountain's summit.

Chris: ""As you accelerate towards the summit, eventually surrounding you and forcing the mortals among you into a cryosleep-like state. The Gods are able to resist and you all watch as the cloud begins to take the shape of a beautiful woman, who begins to walk towards you. A devilish smirk makes its way across her face as she arms herself with equipment of ice, preparing for the inevitable battle...""

Z: ""... Could we possibly teleport to one of the fiery Nine Hells and bring her with us? Toss her into a lake of magma or something. Close enough to the fires of Mount Doom.""

Jay: ""You know

Z: ""Jay, you freak.""

Heidi: ""Is there a nearby lake of fire or something to that effect?""

Chris: ""About 50 feet away you can see the lip of a volcano.""

Heidi: ""I wanna cast Dimension Door or something like it to create a link between our current position and a spot over the volcano to drop her into.""

 I had recently lost my schimitar that doubled as the neck of my lute, man. I play  lute, not sing epics! 

So they left to do their shopping or whatever and i was left in the tavern, a few drunks in the tavern start mocking me. Saying things such as, ""what kind of bard can't even sing?!"" Needless to say, that got me mad. So what did I do? I started talking shit back. I said something along the lines of, ""what kind of man gets drunk in the middle of the day?""

Keep in mind that every aspect of an edition is secondary to the set-up of your individual DM, each edition offers very different bases for your group, and can shift the focus of the game. Also, keep in mind that, unless noted, these refer to the version of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&amp;D) and not basic D&amp;D.

**First Edition (1e)** - This edition of the game introduced many of the staples of the game that have entered popular conscience. If someone was playing D&amp;D in an early 80's sitcom, and the system of releasing supplemental books to expand the ruleset.

*Pros*:

* Quite easy to houserule as few rules are interconnected.
* Combat is very simple compared to some later editions.
* Doesn't require miniatures

*Cons*: 

* Pretty unforgiving in combat there's no shame in running as often as you fight.
* The non-combat skills system is nowhere near as polished as later editions.
* Not for people who can't make a ruling on the fly and keep it consistent as you won't have rules for everything.
* Attacking using a rather cumbersome matrix based on your level and the monsters level

*Things that are just different*:

* Group initiative- all members of a side act together including PCs.
* SAVE VS. 'X' OR DIE &lt;--This is much more common isn't restricted to high level foes.
* THAC0: ""To Hit AC 0"". The targets AC is subtracted from your ""THAC0"" value
* Experience from Gold - You get far more xp from loot than from killing stuff so you tend to have to find where the DMs hidden it rather than it popping out of the orc's skulls also means that engaging in combat is less of a priority.

**Second Editon (2e)** - This edition was produced as a way to consolidate all of the previous rules and supplements into a unified game. This edition mainstreamed out of combat skills

*Pros*: 

* As 1e but...
* More polish on non-combat skills.
* Class kits allow for greater customisation.
* Easily back compatible 1e and 2e change very little fundamentally so you can take rules and items straight from one to the other with little consequence.

*Cons*:

* combat is still harsh and short very easy to die.

*Things that are just different*:

* See 1e
* Less combat centric
* Lower HP
* Life as an adventurer is often short
* XP for gold.

**Third Edition (3e)** - This version of D&amp;D introduces the famous d20 system, with movement and combat now less subjective. Additionally, tons of character customization options were fleshed out, including easier multi-classing, prestige classes, and the feat system.

3rd edition is largely ignored compared to 3.5

**Third Edition, this edition was meant mostly as housekeeping for D&amp;D. Most classes were slightly reworked for balance and standardization reasons (especially rangers, druids, monks, and barbarians), monsters were changed to allow greater customization, and spell-casting was unified.

**pros**:

* Highly customizable characters
* detailed skill system
* Huge variety of unique classes and races
* Spells allow for an incredible range of creativity
* Customizable magic weapons/armor/shields
* Huge library of ""prestige classes"": Classes which you can multiclass into after meeting pre-requisites

**cons**:

* Balance issues between spellcasting and non-spellcasting classes
* ""Save or suck"" spells; players/monsters frequently die due to a single poor roll
* ""5 round day"": Spellcasters quickly expend their highest level spells
* game balance is very poor at high levels
* Numerous one-off combat rules which are difficult and slow to use (particularly Grapple
* ""Dead Levels"": Many classes have many levels at which they only receive a numerical increase to one or more stats

**Pathfinder (PF)** - Developed as an open-source revision to D&amp;D 3.5, increase the number of options players have in any given situation (increasing the numbers of spells, abilities, and feats for all classes), and provide more options to further differentiate characters.

*pros*:

* Published under the ""Open Gaming License""
* Built on 3.5's strengths
* No more ""dead levels""; every class gets something cool at every level
* Single-class characters are unique and interesting
* Class ""Archetypes"" allow customization of classes with alternate class abilities without needing to take a prestige class
* Improved caster/non-caster Balance: Spellcasters are a bit more survivable at lower levels than in 3.5
* ""Save or Suck"" spells slightly improved: spells which outright kill something with one roll are limited for very high levels
* Monters have flat XP values
* Backwards-compatible with a lot content from 3.5 with very little conversion
* The ""Pathfinder Beginner Box"" is an excellent introduction to both Pathfinder and the Dungeons and Dragons hobby as a whole.

*cons*:

* There are still ""Save or Suck"" spells

*Other Stuff*:

* You gain a hit point/skill rank for leveling in your favored class. This makes single-class characters much more viable

**Fourth Edition (4e)** - A massive revamp of the ruleset which changed combat almost entirely. Every class was given ""powers"" rather than having a few specific ""spell-casting"" classes. The basic list of races was changed, introducing healing surges. Out of combat skills are de-emphasized, symbolically by removing alignments, and procedurally by simplifying the skill-system.

*Pros*:

* All characters are interesting and have many abilities; Fighters can do more than just Power Attack
* Very few
* Currently supported by Wizards of the Coast
* Dungeons and Dragons Insider: For a monthly subscription, access to both Dungeon Magazine and Dragon Magazine, and the ~~Virtual Tabletop~~ (NOTE: Due to recent events, the virtual tabletop has been abandoned)
* No more ""active defenses"". Fortitude/Reflex/Will are static values like armor class. Spellcasters make attack rolls just like everyone else
* Many ways for DMs to ramp difficulty up or down
* Characters are very well balanced; there are few strictly bad choices
* Writing encounters is very easy for the DM; much of the math from previous editions was vastly simplified
* ""Minions"" (monsters with 1 hp) make fights with lots of one-shot enemies fun and simple
* Very gentle learning curve

*Cons*:

* Many groups find it harder to RolePlay because the mechanics are so combat-focused
* Combat is highly tactical
* There are no mechanics for mundane crafting or performance

*Other Stuff*:

* Characters start fairly durable
* Dragonborn are in the players handbook
* ""Skill Challenges"": A series of free-form skill tests working toward a common goal. Opinions on the usefulness/fun of skill challenges vary wildly.
* ""Healing Surges"" introduce a new

**D&amp;D Next (Next, Next is being developed via public playtesting. The game thus far has de-emphasized the grid system (as 4e made the use of minis almost required), abandoned the skill system in favor of simple stat mods, and changing monster regeneration. There is currently no release date for D&amp;D Next.

I want all of you to meet Uhh.

He's a half-orc, naturally, he became a rogue just like his ""father"". He thinks he is *awesome* at sneaking.

Oh, but I thought it would be entertaining and the DM agreed). So I have a list of 10 words he knows, and I only use those words in game, until he learns a new one.

He's learned two words so far, so she tried to teach him the word ""sad"". It involved her pointing at her tears and frown and repeating ""sad"". I tried interpreting it as my character would, so now he thinks her name is Sad. And in a tavern, we heard a bard singing an angry song involving phrases like ""Fuck the king, fuck the kingdom, etc..."", so Uhh learned a new song. It involves the word ""fuck"" repeated in a sing-song voice.

He loves bright colors, he thinks he's really sneaky.

Anyway, we escaped. Uhh was the first party member to escape (the only one to just launch himself out of the second-story window...no one else wanted to try that for some reason). When he hit the ground, he saw two men getting on horses and riding away quickly. So he ran after them. I rolled Int checks each turn to see if he'd figure out that he couldn't catch them, and it only took about three turns before he gave up and turned around.

Two guards had been chasing him

**Guard 1** (the first one to reach him): ""Who are you?""
 
**Uhh**: ""Uhh.""

**Guard 1**: ""No

**Guard 2** (having caught up): ""Who or what is he...she...it?""

**Uhh**: (points to self) ""Uhh!"" (points to guard 1) ""You!""

**Party Member** (who chased after the guards when she saw the problem): ""His name is Uhh!""

**Guard 1**: ""You're fucking kidding me!""

**Uhh**: (hearing his newest word, fuck, fuck!""

**Guard 2**"" ""His name is Uhh? His *name* is...Uhh?!""

**Uhh**: ""I Uhh! You you!""

**Party Member**: ""Yes

**Guard 1**: ""Did his parents drop him on his head?""

**Uhh** (who thinks the guards are pretty stupid for not getting this): (points to self) ""Uhh..."" (to guards) ""You..."" (to party member) ""Sad...""

**Party member**: ""His name is Uhh!""

**Guard 1**: ""Dropped on his head. Definitely dropped on his head.""

**Guard 2:** (mimes drinking and signals the ""crazy"" sign)

**Guard 1**: ""Ok

**Uhh**: (mimes getting on a horse and riding)

**Guard 2**: ""...Horsemen?""

**Uhh** (having learned a new word): ""Whores men! Whores men! Fuck whores!""

**Party Member**: ""YES HE MEANS HORSEMEN.""

So anyways. I always hear ""treat your environments like it is a character itself, like Corruption, Crime, Economy, Law, Lore, and Society. And these stats effect the players' rolls when they want to craft items, etc etc.. Cool

Well, lets say the Mountains of Madness region has a special effect mechanic where the players slowly lose sanity. While the party is travelling there, they will recieve this effect, *no matter where they go in the region.*

That brings me to the next subject: **Travel.** In all of the games I've seen, we decide to go to ____ town."" and the DM responds ""After a long journey, you arrive at ____"". To me, this seems like its trivial. The players get no tangible feel for the region they are in. So I want to propose a travel system.

On the map area of your Region Sheet, so the DC of the road is *17*.  One player will roll *4d20* (because the road is 4 ""units"" long), and he's safe if he rolls under 16... but if he hits 17+, the party is suddenly stopped on their way to the Castle by a roadblock of marauders. They can choose to fight and kill them, or to pay off the bandits for safe passage.

Or the players are in a region where law is enforced and trade is flourishing. These roads are prosperous

Now, so in theory it would really bring out the world to the players in a new way, and tie their experience to it in a way that directly effects them.

I would love to hear some ideas and thoughts about this

Today I finally got to play my first game of D&amp;D. A tabletop game store near where I live hosts a D&amp;D 4e Encounters session every Wednesday and I finally worked up the nerve to go and join it. Having never played before, we forgot that trolls can come back from being killed due to regeneration. We contemplated chopping off it's head after we had killed it a second time, but the DM had us roll a history check, from which we learned the perils of quartering a troll. We came up with a creative solution to the problem though, combining Wall of Leaves with a lit torch to create a bonfire, with which we roasted the troll corpses. Sadly, the trolls dropped no loot. Next we advanced on a walled town that had been plagued with troll attacks. We learned from their leader that a troll army was approaching. Two of my allies went to work building pitch-filled traps, so I managed to explore the camp fully and learn all of their battle plans. Unfortunately, we have to repel the invaders and save the town. I'm looking forward to it.

A halfling rogue can pretty easily get their bonuses up to the point where they can take 10 on the DC 80 skill check by level 20

*   He divvied up experience points based on who killed what
*   This was further complicated by the fact that he started you at level one regardless of what level the rest of the party was. 
*   He would often railroad in the most obvious ways ever. For instance, AND reflex roll to see if you get out of the way in time. 
*   He did knowledge checks in reverse. He'd have you roll and then ask YOU ""What do you know about (the spell being cast, etc)?""  
*   He had a DMNPC that was ludicrously overpowered. It was a sorcerer that would basically part the seas for us every time we needed help. Oh you need a boat for 6 people? Here you go. You need to take this monster down 50 hp? I can do that. You need to store 2 tons of loot somewhere? I gotcha. 
*   There was also some serious crowding going on. There were six people at the table to begin with, he'd cling to the character they rolled up and not let them go. So each round in battle took more than 10 minutes.

This might also work for the Heart of the elemental plane of fire.

Earlier this semester I was reading about science and I thought to myself ""damn, of course I do, just put it in DND terms! I don't know about you, but this is how I comprehend everything. Also, I figure I might use it for some depraved reason in the future.

So first we need to figure out how to correspond degrees of Celsius into d6 of fire damage. I found that Lava can be estimated somewhat fairly into 1000 C. Immersion in laval deals 20d6 fire damage, so can probably use something similar for mere ""exposure"" to a small amount of star matter.

The Sun's surface is 6000 degrees Celsius. So being immersed in the surface of the sun should deal 120d6 fire damage a round! Thankfully, but with a high enough level character and protection from fire / resist fire an epic level dude might be able to swim in the sun without immunity.

The core is a whole different matter. At 15,000 d6 of fire damage a round! Mere exposure will steal deal 30,000 d6 a round. You probably shouldn't try rolling that, it might take a while. 

Of course, you might argue that a Fire Elemental is fine and can maintain his identity.)

1350498185.0,11n4oc,Meet grog. He has 76 strength.,GreatRobo,109,32,110,"Okay. So this character is a water orc barbarian (Rage +4) with a starting strength of 22 (18 +4 from water orc). He then takes a level of fighter (For bonus feat) and three levels of orc paragon (+2 str). He then goes into the war hulk prestige class (Miniatures handbook) which gives him a +2 strength on each of the ten levels of this PRC. He then goes into frenzied berserker (Frenzy +6 str. stacks with rage) from complete warrior. He then has a wizard cast wish for him five times for an additional +5 to strength. He wears a +6 belt of giants strength and has a clawed arm graft from book of vile darkness (?). He also puts all of his ability increases into str.

SO 22(base)+4(rage)+6(frenzy)+20(war hulk)+4(clawed arm)+5 (Wish)+5(ability increases)+6 (Belt)+2 (Enlarge person)+2(orc paragon)=76

This is grog. He can lift 942,710,400. He is a 17 foot tall orc that weights 1620 pounds. People call him a monster. 

EDIT: forgot to say that he had a permanent enlarge person spell cast on hum so that he could meet the requirements for the war hulk prestige class.

EDIT: It has been brought to my attention that the graft is a bad idea both because it is an inherent bonus (Will not stack with wish) and it will drive my character insane. So poor grog only has 72 strength when raging and frenzied.

Hobgoblins are probably one of the most commonly used monstrous humanoids in DnD, and Gnolls. However, between 3.x, Pathfinder, and 4e, Hobgoblins have never quite attained the feel that their description shoots for.

[Pathfinder's Bestiary entry](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/hobgoblin.html#_hobgoblin) describes Hobgoblins as ""militaristic and fecund"", a bow, and some armor. Their favored class in 3.5 is fighter.

But, and +4 to stealth in Pathfinder. *Why*? They have Darkvision, but their Environment is ""Warm Hills"" in 3.5, and their Environment is ""Temperate Hills"" in Pathfinder. Again, *why*? They receive +2 to Dexterity and +2 to Constitution in both 3.5 and Pathfinder (+1 level adjustment in 3.5, of course). Their items and flavor seems more indicative of a race which prefers melee combat, and Pathfinder's bestiary says ""a hobgoblin stands 5 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds."" On a human scale

4th edition does a bit better, page 278) and weight from 190–240 lb, making them a bit bigger than your average human. They receive +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, +2 to Athletics, and +2 to History. In addition, their racial power allows them to save against an ongoing effect. As a whole, if there are adventurers around)

I made a group (essentially a terrorist group) known as The Children of The Moon. They follow a set of ideals established by the group's founder who was an elf woman named Gholfir

They do anything from harrassing a newly settled village to kidnapping the child of a large city's lord for ransom. Their cells are located in the wilderness and in cities

Lycanthropes also work slightly different in my campaign. They shift freely between their forms and range from rats, and vultures. The curse can be transmitted but only if you're bit on the night of a full moon. Silver inhibits the lycanthrope's ability to rapidly regenerate.

Another detail is that the same goddess that the Children follow also opposes abominations of nature. Though the Children see themselves as alpha-predators

The Children operate in secrecy in my campaign. It helps them to maintain their cells within cities as well as hide from the hunters. The general populace doesn't know of the Children's existence. Only the hunters and lords of cities that have fought them for years know of them. The hunters and lords don't bring their existence to light because doing so would cause panic within the cities if the people knew terrorists live among them.


And that's how I made lycanthropes extra interesting. Just thought I'd share and get some feedback.

Edit: Forgot to mention. The Children use lycanthropes that they call Ferals. They're people that were given the curse but their minds couldn't handle it and they are trapped in their beastial forms.  They've lost their human side and only desire blood. The Children see them still as special since they've received the gift but treat them as lesser beings. They're kept in cages and only released when the Children wish to shed blood.


TL;DR: Werewolves are cool.

1375914163.0,1jwybx,[House Rule] Truths,OFTHEHILLPEOPLE,86,12,15,"So I've DMed a few games in my time and I've started implementing this House Rule in my games to give my players a bit of control in creating the gaming world that they're playing in.  So far it's been a big success and promotes players roleplaying because they're utilizing information that they've created and added to the game.  Here is the description:

**What is a “Truth”?**

Every single time you and your players get together and play roleplaying games they are discovering facts and realities about the fantastic world that their characters are adventuring in.  Every time they ask “What happens?” or “Where are we going?” they are discovering the very building blocks that make this world different from every other.  The idea behind Truths is that you are leaving gaps in the gaming world and putting the power of filling those gaps in the hands of your players.  By letting your players create those facts and Truths about the world they are now investing into that world with their own vision of what should be there.  As players progress through the story they are given opportunities to create more Truths for the world that immediately fill the world with wonder and intrigue.

**Starting a Game with Truths**

A good way to get players involved with a game world is when they are making their characters.  Discuss ideas with them about what kind of character they would like to play and once they have a solid idea ask them to think about two things from their background that either they learned or was taught by the people they grew up with.  An example of this would be if someone is making everyone’s favorite character

**Creating a World to Play In**

After players have created their characters and given the DM their first two Truths it should be pretty clear what kind of setting the players want to play in or what kinds of adventures they’d like to get involved in.  Building off of our example of Grog

**Gaining More Truths**

So you’ve got a group together and they’ve been adventuring in the world created using the Truths.  Now what?  Throughout their adventures each character will develop and learn new and interesting things about the world

**Truths as Secrets and Background for the “Big Bad”**

The players aren’t the only characters in the game that can benefit from Truths.  For a DM trying to figure out what to do next in the game and working off the Truths their players provided them when creating their characters they should create a number of Secrets affecting the world equal to the number of players.  In a four player game (Three players and a DM) the DM would create four Secrets with consequences that the players may not realize are related.   For example, a legendary Dragon from ages past, has awakened and prophesized that a hero with humble beginnings would find the Ark of Heroes and use its power to spell the Dragon’s doom.   The DM now has several secret Truths that would write as “The Ancient Dragon, Azeroc, has risen”, “A Prophecy calls for a hero to slay him”, and “The Ark of Heroes must be found to save the day”.  Having these secrets the DM can again make adventure hooks that reveal them to the players and lead them to a story resolution.

Our DM turned on some French bistro music and began his introduction of Jacques the Muffin Man, speaking in an impeccable French accent.  After this rather hilarious and slightly racist speech, we attacked him.  Although we are a rather strong team, Jacques seemed to have a specific muffin for every attack we threw at him.  Fire ball? Blueberry muffin.  Physical attack? Stale muffin.  And when we managed to corner him, he would use powdered sugar to teleport away. “I am Jacques, you can never defeat me!”  We fought him for a good 10 minutes when one of our group members had an idea.  “We need to make a swastika.” After a small moment of confusion and a long period of laughter, being the mage, presumably far away.

One of the first that comes to mind was actually my first time playing.



My friend was a a broad sword wielding half-orc damage sponge. Meanwhile I was your standard run of the mill bow wielding Elven ranger. 


We are in a dungeon and go to open up this makeshift door and realize there is an entire village of kobolds on the other side of it. The first thing out of my friends mouth is ""Shut the fucking door"". 


Our DM decides to play along and has them all rush the door. So my friend in turn braces it... and rolls a natural 20. Ripping the door off it's hinges and crushing the 2 kobolds behind it. He then picks up the door and using it like a shield in the doorway. Entering him into a pushing match with the kobolds on the other side. 


So now its my job to shoot around him. Which I succeed in doing to the first few times. Then while trying to fire over his shoulder I rolled a Crit fail... Our DM looks at me a says ""roll to see if it hits"" to which I rolled a Crit... Effectively one hitting my best friend in the back of the head. 


My DM was merciful and let him live at the cost of an INT point (he suffered brain damage but lived)



**TL;DR I crit failed then crit hit and one shot my best friend.**

When we last left off, where they planned on throwing Auril into a volcano or something. Z went to kick her in the cooch through a dimension door whose exit was over the mouth of a volcano and ended up being dragged down with her. Would our favorite asshat survive this encounter?

Yes. I think his idea was clever

Chris: ""Alright

Z: ""Before the minute starts, and someone to sing 'Under Pressure' from the first chorus.""

Jay: ""Any other weird demands?""

Z: ""Yes. I need to know how gravity works on this plane. Same as our own, up to choice?""

Chris: ""Same as ours. I'll grab the stuff. Steve

The materials were obtained and the minute began. As soon as the pencil hit the paper, failed to understand. Drawings were made, curses were thrown about, and we all discovered that Chris has a beautiful dramatic baritone. Eventually, his 60 seconds ended and he slammed his pencil on the table.

Z: ""Well, so that's a no-go. I imagine I can't cast fly or anything like it, making that pointless. On top of all of this, Auril is still attached to my ankle. So I'm gonna toss my bag full of bags of holding away and crawl into my portable hole with Auril. Kind of obvious and boring if you ask me.""

Chris had taken his paper during his explanation and was staring at it with a studious look on his face. A few seconds after Z finished explaining his plan

Chris: ""I think I get the gist of all these calculations

Chainsaw: ""Sure. I love this kind of stuff.""

Jay: ""I don't know how you came to the conclusion that crawling into the IKEA warehouse sized portable hole was the logical and obvious thing to do. That's probably the last thing I'd think of.""

Heidi: ""Same here. I probably would have attempted to grab onto the sides of the volcano.""

Z: ""Yeah

Chris had him make a few checks and eventually he was in the hole

Z: ""Right! I'm gonna run off and hide in one of our crates of stuff or something and work on comprehend languages. She should be some kind of incapacitated for a while. Seems reasonable to me.""

Chris: ""Fair enough. You sprint off while she's broken and in pain and work on setting up the ritual in one of your crates full of swag

Z: ""Nice. I'll jump out of the box and heal her.""

Everyone gave him one of those ""say whaaaat?"" looks while tilting their heads.""

Chris: ""I don't normally do this

Steve: ""Yeah

Z: ""Totally sure. While I do this I'll explain to her that trying to kill me is pointless since the only way out of here would entail swimming through magma. If we work together

And so we listened as Z and Auril had one of the strangest conversations we'd heard after Z had fiddled with his phone for a bit. He tossed a d20 up in the air on occasion

Z: ""So, and if you joined us we could eliminate a few you have enmity with.""

Everyone looked dumbfounded as he made this request. Chris leaned forward in that way you would while trying to explain something to a child.

Chris: ""How do you plan on doing this?""

Z: ""Fantastic question, I'd like to use the results as a chance for her to be charmed by my amazing charisma.""

Everyone's eyes grew to the size of saucers as they stared at him. Jaws dropped

Heidi: ""That's absolutely brilliant.""

Z: ""The fun part is that I don't know the results either. I kept my eyes on you the whole time. The way I see it, shall we?""

He tossed the phone over to Chris

Chris: ""No roll was beneath 15

Z: ""Fantastic. Now we just have to get out of here.""

Heidi: ""Once again

Chris: ""You watched as Z and Auril tumbled down into the volcano. Eventually Z crawled into a hole and dragged Auril into it with him. The hole shrunk and eventually fell out of view.""

Heidi: ""Could I make some kind of telekinetic link with him?""

Chris: ""Well

An 18. With all of the modifiers added

Chris: ""I'll let you do it

Heidi: ""You're insane. I don't know how we're going to get you out of there. Any bright ideas?""

Z: ""My bright ideas bank has been drained. Anyone else have a clever thought?""

Steve: ""Could *we* cast fly and roll for a stronger resist elements to look for the hole? And couldn't Z open the hole a bit more to match the diameter of the block of ice so it'd be easier to see?""

Jay: ""How would we get the hole back up here? You can't really grab a hole.""

Chainsaw: ""Well, right? Theoretically, we could use a mage hand or something to grab it and bring it up. Also, I can't make heads or tails of these calculations. There's the speed of light, strength of normal gravity, something about weightlessness, another something about distance from magma to ignite... he'd have to explain it to me.""

Z: ""It's a mystery to everyone. Except me. I keep my secrets close to me. You'll never take me Lucky Charms!""

Chris: ""... Right. I suppose I could let you do it. Why don't you at least explain the distance from magma to ignite so they know how deep in they can go?""

Z: ""Well, I multiplied it by 10 and came up with 30 meters. Converted to standard that's about 30 yards or 90 feet, which should be more than enough to spot a hunk of colorless ice and a black hole floating in a pool of orange/red magma. At least I think so. Assuming we're going by 20/20 vision. But then again we might be able to augment our seeing distance with magic. Or use a telescope. That works too.""

Jaws dropped again. It made sense if you thought about it long enough. Chris let it slide

Z: ""I'd like to think that she could conjure an army of ice golems or something at will. Since

Chainsaw: ""We need to gett Matt and Gandalf back.""

Chris: ""That's gonna be the fun part. Their souls were ripped apart in the Diamond Dust

Heads were slammed against the table. I was dead forever

Chris: ""Remember how Gandalf said you'd have to take their places in their respective Pantheon? That time is coming. You can't run from it forever. What do you plan on doing?""

Vulgarities were tossed around the table as everyone wracked their brain for ideas. Nothing came out of anyone. Eventually

Z: ""Imma get some drank. Anyone want anything?""

Loads of alcohol was requested. Eventually he came back with more fruity drinks for himself and Heidi along with a repertoire of other drinks.

Steve: ""I got nothing.""

Chainsaw: ""Nope.""

Jay: ""Well

Heidi: ""Me neither.""

Z smirked and chugged most of his drink. He slammed it on the table as he gave us all a shit eating grin.

Z: ""It's simple. We kill some good Gods and take *their* places. Gods can create life

The reason why can best be summed up in a story of when I tried to give them the classic ""mini dungeon"" an ancient Dwarven outpost full of dwarf undead that had been plaguing the countryside for generations. 

For reference I try to make an environment that allows the players to do what EVER they want and I just have the world react to them, the guards will probably deball them with out a trial and leave them as an example for the rest of the world.

So they hear about the undead in a local INN upon over hearing some local folk lore. they ask around town and find a map to the old outpost back 1000 years ago when the dwarven empire used to reach this far before its decline so long ago

They head out I have the loot all planned out even a set of antique playing cards that the thief can use to get him in good with the local thieves guild.
The Paladin still new at being an attacker (was played by a girl who IRL was tiny and not used to being aggressive... later she became impossible to fucking land a blow on let alone get a monster that could survive the stupid amount of damage she pumped out).
She takes point
So then she says something that BLEW MY SOCKS OFF ""I give him a traditional Dwarven greeting"" 
she rolls diplomacy and gets a 17... I just sat there amazed. 

I was thinking of how I wanted magic to work over long periods of time, everything was perfect the exact right thing to do to try to reach the humanity of this skeleton.

I sat there so long with this bewildered look on my face calculating the world in my head so long my players asked if I was ok COMPLETELY unaware of the dam they had broken in my world forcing it to flood into my head. I told them I needed time but it was worth it trust me!

Finally I had him respond in kind and they started talking and eventually the Dwarf invited them into the room and they sat and talked about what happened there the story of the empire and how the dwarven military caste was almost completly wiped out in the war with the Orcs.

They went to the Dwarven King and requested on the soldiers behalf to be resurrected as was par with their terms of service (how do you get someone to sign up for the volunteer army? Promise to rezz him if he should die).
They did not get audience with the king they got a minister who said they did not have the money to rezz everyone in all of those contracts.
The Party found the current head of the Dwarf armed forces
They used him to see the King who collected bones from the military caste from all over

They were heros of the dwarven people from them on and got 3 story statues of them carved in the ""Hall of honored notDwarfs!"" and reversed the fate of an entire kingdom with a simple hello.

Original Post: [The Amazing r/DnD Dungeon](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1h0kw7/the_amazing_rdnd_dungeon/?sort=new)

I apologize if my original post was unclear. This is meant as a ridiculous

It was brought to my attention by [Two_Plus_Two_Is_Ten](http://www.reddit.com/user/Two_Plus_Two_Is_Ten) that many people may not want to make ""empty"" rooms

The other thing that I notice is that what we have so far is mostly puzzles/traps. They're well and good, flavorful combat.

Also, and the last 8 will be level 6. I think a sub-boss would be appropriate in room 8 and the real boss should be in room 16. 

I've also decided to use a format suggested by Deep_Matrix. The format for posts is as follows:

* Room Number- Title (title not required)

* Description/Flavor Text

* Challenge(This will be either the combat

* Loot

I'll do an example using my Room 0 from the original post.

EXAMPLE (please use this format):

**Room 0- Cavern Entrance**

**Description:** Carved into the side of a mountain

**Challenge:** Enter the dungeon. 

**Loot:** 2 rusty longswords and a rusty longspear can be found behind one of the crates (Perception DC 15). 

Please do not repeat any rooms. At this point I've also realized that we do not need to go in order. I also would request that those that commented with those awesome ideas on the original post designate room numbers to their challenges and re-comment on this post in the new format to have their ideas included. 

Remember

**When it is done I will be posting the final version of the dungeon.**

Now [BalrogTheLunchbox](http://www.reddit.com/user/BalrogTheLunchbox) presented an awesome idea: 

&gt; Before everyone starts just building, location, and additional details as to what the dungeon is. From there, each reply to the parent is a room that chains down. This will help to keep a consistency to each dungeon and allow for a number of dungeons to be created, allowing users pick a theme they like.

This combined with the awesome ideas that I've been seeing made me think- would this be a good idea for a new subreddit? The OP will give the dungeon's edition, location, and room number.

Sorry to be so long winded

-He writes fantasy fiction. He's brought in a character from his stories that he is dead set on having be the baddest mofo out there ... at level 5...
-He has asked repeatedly to shoehorn in characters from this story (which takes place in an entirely dif. world) for the purpose only of his character getting to interact with his other characters. 
-He is EXTREMELY hostile towards one of our party members and rude as well both in game and meta. 
-the worst for me
-His character rides roughshot over everyone else who has valid Ideas. 

So, but pulled my punches. 

The group is frustrated, will likely result in a rift in our real life friendship. What do I do r/dnd? 

TLDR: Rude player rides roughshot over party and at the same time doesn't pay attention to the game at all. He also shoehorns in his character from his fantasy novel that doesnt exist in our world

Thanks for any advice. 

Edit/Update: 

So our game was last night and TLDR: It went 100% better ... ok 95%. 

I talked to ""joe"" a couple days before the game and it went pretty good. I explained in delicate terms that I was not happy with the way the previous week's game had gone. He then surprised me by saying he knew he wasn't a great participant last week and that he was sorry. I was kind of shocked but very relieved. The rest was pretty simple. I conveyed with him that the hostility towards other players and meta game hate was the exact opposite of the game I wanted to run. He agreed. Fun for all or nothing. I couldn't have expected a more receptive attitude than this. I let the lack of attention go for the time and decided to only bring it up if it was an issue in the next game. It was (but to a much lesser extent, jokingly, and he laughed and said ""yea, those were tits. Sorry."". He proceded to pay more attention the rest of the night. All in all we played one of the best games we've played yet. I tried to engage him more to make sure he was having fin too, and knew that I wasn't trying to play favorites. BEST OF ALL, he and the vet player he was having trouble with, worked together like champs. Thanks chiefly, to his improved attitude and some godlike patience and goodwill from my vet player. Thanks again for all the help guys and gals. This sub and your advice absolutely 
helped me in getting perspective and setting my game back on course.

Construction:
I bought a 6'x3' table on craigslist. Then cut and taped a piece of 1/8"" Melamine paneling to the top. Applied a 1"" grid via T square and sharpie. Then over the top I attached a piece of clear plastic that I found at AC Moore. Underneath the table I mounted 5 small speakers through which I play background music.

The entire room in which it sits has become our ""gaming room"" and has several pictures and paintings that fit the genre. We also have a few oil lamps and during gameplay I replace the overhead light with a remote controlled color changing LED light (like the one in this video) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t608e06QiYg


Edit: because I didnt add this the first time around. the next upgrade I will be adding is a small shelving unit that goes all the way around the table with about 3""s or so of space so that one can fit his books and extra paper and such.

An elderly wizard levelled a staff at them

See
Don’t they sound heroic?
Well, they should fuck up the guy’s day.
The wizard introduces himself as Menras, immobilizing, and totally stripping them of weapons, they decide that it might be a better idea to wait until he’s SLEEPING to kill him.
Our heroic adventurers earn the wizard’s trust by letting the incredibly diplomatic and only trustworthy member of the party talk them out of the situation.

The wizard Menras quickly has a change of mood and seems jovial to finally have company. However

Then, serving as a trapfinder and general rogue. Being a servant of fucking Lolth didn’t help her popularity with the group, but after killing things with her crossbow and saving some lives, they accepted her into the fold.
Having spent almost two weeks barely surviving down in the Underdarkm half starved, the group- as evil as some of them are- make good on the wizard’s hospitality and settle in for the night. In fact, the sleeping goes so well, that nobody bothers to get up to kill Menras in his sleep.

The next morning though... They meet Menras’ familiar. Io is the one who first spots him when she wanders into the lab just over the basement below. Expecting to find a number of magical goods, she instead takes sight of a two-tailed, black cat calmly licking its paw. The cat greats her ambivalently, walking behind one set of beakers and reappearing almost behind her, in a pjhysics warping sort of magic-y way.
Immediately intrigued, and upon further investigation he tells her that he is simply a Not-Cat. Io, incredibly confused and somewhat irritated, snaps at the little guy wondering what she should even call him.

“Well
And that’s when they met fucking Knots.
Fucking. Knots.

Now after the initial mini quest that started the game my friends decided to head west to see a decently famous blacksmith because they had things to sell and were looking for things to buy. On the way i was attempting to introduce a side quest about the small cities new crime lord by having 2 hired goons collecting tolls on the way. The party of three guys was essentially a dark elf poison expert ranger, and human elite, and a crack nasty mage type who worshipped the goddess of magic. So the Human was in the front, the guy is generally a great roleplayer so i was expecting some good roleplay with the toll collectors, instead before before i even managed to tell the descriptions of the guys collecting tolls (they were kinda big and scary) he decided to attack them and basically get smeared into the ground. 

So my party ends up killing these guys and the intro to this quest is basically ruined

So my question is have you guys ever had instances were people attacked someone they shouldn't and payed the price? and how did you deal with it afterwards. Should i have let him die like i did by using the full power of my npc's like i did? or would there have been another solution

Players will not be allowed to choose an alignment. A character must be roleplayed based on the character's background as written by the player. The alignment space on the character sheet will be kept blank. The DM (me) will keep roleplay notes on each character behind the screen and score their alignments based on their in-game choices and reasoning. All characters default to True Neutral

Without that alignment stat on character sheets, such behavior will have consequences. I just want people to roleplay in the game and think in terms or their character, not in terms of the stat on their sheet.

Earlier in the year my friend told me he'd be starting up a Pathfinder campaign. My older brother played it in high school and I'm really interested in learning. Our party is a rag tag group of pirates whose captain just died and is now being lead by a crazed barbarian known as ""Mad Hatter"" who is fueled by rum. The first job we've taken involves sneaking into a party at a high class mansion to acquire a magically sealed bottle in the basement and as a bonus, our rogue bluffed the guard to rush off in a hurry, but another one saw this act and came to confront us. He was deflected by another bluff pointing him towards our ""captain"". We had averted attention away from the basement and just needed an opportune moment to enter.

Then things got interesting to say the least.

The host of the party noticed our presence and came to see what we were up to. Our rogue, I thought this was the way to your bedroom."" That got him away from us with her around his arms, then our gunslinger had the best idea ever. He tossed his glove in the face of the host challenging him in a duel for her affection. That got most of the guests outside and we were finally prepared to make our move when the guard we directed to the ""captain"" was sent flying 20 feet landing at our feet bursting through a door. Luckily most had already cleared out for the duel and the rest were too afraid to do anything. Meanwhile, the duel was set, our rogue had planned to daze the host quickly so the gunslinger could cap him before anyone was the wiser, however both failed their rolls leaving our intrepid gunslinger at the hosts mercy. In a twist of fate, the host himself missed leaving all to the ridicule of the crowd. Everyone was so preoccupied by the collective failure that they all failed to notice the strange character casting off to the side. In a moment, nobody realizing they were even there, crispy host. His heal is also 0 and rolling a 4 didn't help. He took some of the rum that he keeps on him at all times and starts pouring down the host's throat which the guards didn't exactly appreciate. They barely managed to pull him off, and everyone else successfully entered the basement.

So we get to this city that's been being terrorized by a colossal Minotaur and we are the ones that have to kill this thing. Being the leader that doesn't like having my group help me, that this monster succeeds, smacking me through a building, bringing down the foundation. After a few rounds of my team fighting this thing, then my ogre buddy coming to find me, I awaken to see this thing wrecking us. I hatch a plan.

I yell out to my druid and tell him to use telepathic link on everyone, bringing my sword down onto it."" My team likes the idea. Orge picks me up, places me on the end of his tree and swings for the fences, at the optimal point, I leap. Both of us rolling really high didn't help me get up high enough.

Before I know it, flings me up even higher. Still not high enough, I see the druid jumping around from building to building on his huge dire tiger. Casting bull's strength on himself, grabs my arm and rolls a nat20 to launch me further up.

By this time, I roll to hit. NAT(MUTHAFUGGIN')20. Confirm crit. I flip (like kirby's up B in smash bros) and come down 400ft at extremely high velocity directly onto his head. We create a gigantic crater, I take fall damage, almost killing me, dealing close to 1000 damage to this thing, and only about 250 to me. 

Turns out that this thing had a lot more health than we thought. It survived the damage, I'm not opposed to cooking this thing, that was terrorizing these city people, alive and feeding the entire city along with our group AND the people from our original town with leftovers.

The following resources are divided into some specific categories, specific editions, etc.

**Character Sheets**

[Wizards of the Coast Official Character Sheets](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/charactersheet) [free] - These are the official character sheets for the latest commercially available iteration of Dungeons and Dragons. They are downloadable PDFs, they will keep you abreast of every facet of your character. *4e*

[The Character Sheet Archive](http://www.dragonfang.com/archive/dungeons/dunge_01.htm) [free] - These were the official character sheets released by TSR (who owned D&amp;D before Wizards of the Coast). They include character sheets, etc, and remain available for most old editions of the game. *1e, 2e, 3e*

[ADnD Download Sheets](http://www.adnddownloads.com/sheets.php) [free] - These sheets are special in that they are entirely user created, are how some of the older sheets work. More experienced players will remember the days of spreadsheets and excel files being used to calculate stats, and those exist here for most of the older editions. Just type in your stats, and your ability mods will all be calculated for you! As a bonus, this site houses a few select character sheets in French. *2e, 3e, 3.5e, 4e*

[Myth-Weavers](http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetindex.php) [free] - Once you've registered on the website, you can share your character sheets with the other people in your group, and they can see updates as they are made. *all editions*

**Character Builders (PCs)**

[WotC Character Builder](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/characterbuilder) [$9.95 a month] - The official Wizards character builder is a powerhouse. It guides you through the character creation process from beginning to end, and Dragon Magazine officially released. It does not always handle homebrew rules very well (so you will sometimes have to fudge your numbers to reflect DM created items, for example) but with such a large compendium to draw from, you can usually find SOMETHING to fit your rules. The subscription to the builder is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons Insider (DDI) account, and with that you get not only the character builder, but access to [The Compendium](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/compendium) (an appendix of all things D&amp;D), several online magazines, etc. Tiered pricing is available for multi-month subs. *4e*

[Hero Lab](http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab) [$20, as well as allowing plug-ins from additional modules. It's a little pricey, but unlike the official builder, it's not a subscription, so if you really like one or two modules, you'll save in the long run. *3.5e, PF

[PCGen](http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/01_overview.php) [free] - This downloadable program prides itself on its adherence to the Open Gaming License (OGL) that allows publishers to print their own modules for the D20 system, it's opensource, it's very well maintained, and there is a wealth of wiki help and documentation. *I have not personally vetted this program yet, from what I can tell it's for 3.5e, but it may include others as well*

[4e Character Builder](http://www.lukerymarz.com/apps/characterbuilder/CharacterBuilder.html#) [free] - This bare bones (and no longer actively maintained) character builder will let you build a character based on some of the originally released 4th Edition books. They still require knowledge of specific powers

[HeroForge](http://nzcomputers.net/heroforge/default35.asp) [free] - If you like spreadsheets, or NPC imaginable. The amount of coverage of 3.5e is almost ridiculous, but there is plenty of stuff here for Pathfinder, and some for 4e as well. *3.5e, PF, 4e*

**NPC Generators**

[donjon RPG Tools](http://donjon.bin.sh/4e/random/#npc) [free] - What initially looks like a very basic generator is actually a [very powerful set of tools](http://donjon.bin.sh/) for randomly generating everything from NPCs backstories, and can be used on the fly, so DMs of all skill levels can add a lot of depth to their game-world. *Any edition*

[Pathguy Character Generator](http://www.pathguy.com/cg35.htm) [free] - This generator (which is also available in [4e](http://www.pathguy.com/cg4.htm) and [PF](http://www.pathguy.com/PathfinderCore.htm) flavors) is a MUCH more complex version of the typical character generators. It allows you to control every aspect of character generation, build an entire village of Dwarven Barbarians, you can do just that! It's not recommended for beginners, and it's not a quick process, but if used effectively ahead of time, it can be quite powerful. Also useful as a full-fledged character builder. *3.5e, PF

[Dragonsfoot](http://www.dragonsfoot.org/fe/articles/1echargen.shtml) [free] - This could actually be included in PC or NPC

1374225243.0,1imdx3,Alignment Court: Is my LN cleric evil?,luxoflax,72,17,101,"**Tl;DR:** My St. Cuthbert cleric committed two acts my GM ruled as evil worthy of an alignment shift:

1) preemptively smashing the head of a corpse in a necromancer's lair (after we'd already faced multiple undead attacks)

2) burning an unintelligible prayer book discovered in the lead necromancer's personal office



 **Players and GMs of DnD! I call upon you for a ruling in this Alignment Court**!

 Please share your thoughts on my last session. Is my cleric evil? Should he suffer an alignment shift? Is the GM's ruling fair? Why does Firefox's auto correct want to change ""aspergillum"" to ""paper girl""?

In a new campaign with my group I'm playing as a LN cleric of St. Cuthbert. I consider my cleric to be a hardcore devotee: I used some of his starting gold to get him a silver necklace of St. Cuthbert

In our current quest we are exploring a monastery that was once good but had been twisted by an evil guild of necromancers. Every single corpse we'd come upon would either rise as a zombie or be host to spider hatchlings.

After already facing ten of these ""Surprise! It's a zombie!"" attacks I now fully distrusted all bodies we encountered.

We went into a room and saw a body that ""shows signs of having committed suicide."" I asked if his body was intact and was told it was. I announced that my cleric would be remaining 5ft away and would be issuing a prayer from his book to St. Cuthbert to save the body's soul and guide him from evil.

I then declared I'd be bashing his head in with my mace before he rises as the undead. My GM insisted that would be an evil act I couldn't do because I would be ""desiccating a corpse"". I pointed out that it was a corpse

GM insisted that as a LN cleric I couldn't go around smashing the heads of bodies and that he could've been a good guy before he died, and he had committed suicide. My deity does not let evil actions stand and my character isn't stupid enough to risk another zombie attack in closed quarters.

After much bickering it was declared that my cleric could smash his head in

In the next room we found the cult leader's desk. It was covered in symbols we couldn't read but we could detect evil around the desk. Doing a search

I declared that I'd be calling on St. Cuthbert's name and burning the book to prevent the spread of evil and evil thoughts. Again

Once more I defended the need to stop what my cleric saw as an evil threat in a room that was totally evil. 

The GM argued that I couldn't read the book so I didn't know whether it was evil. Maybe it was the prayer book from the previously un-evil occupants. He said that ""ignorance of an evil act is still an evil act.""

I argued that the tenants of St. Cuthbert work not only to maintain order but also to prevent the faithful from losing the path. From all the knowledge my cleric had to go on; it would make perfect sense to burn the book. I'd be stopping evil and ""wrong"" ways of thought

He ruled that this action

What is your verdict?

1374737254.0,1j0jjj,(4.0e) Second time DMing and the PCs seem suicidal.,Bringerofpie,66,6,103,"I decided to run a DnD game with some of my friends after a pretty successful run with one of my other groups of friends. However some of my PCs are a mix of 'Chaotic Stupid' and just plain stupid. Here is a few of the many examples.

1. I made a minor mystery where the players encounter an unconscious NPC on the road, but they didn't know that. So I let it slide and tell them they find a journal and 2 flasks on his person. The flasks are labeled 'invisibility potions', but after some testing of the potions and reading the journal they find that the potions actually are just a strong acid that dissolves whatever it touches and the dead NPC believed he made an invisibility potion (which he dies after drinking). After finding this out, one of the PCs drinks one of the potions anyway and threatens to quit if I were to kill him for drinking something he knew quite well would kill him. So I decided instead to merely dissolve his tongue, and to make fun of him I told him he couldn't speak using his tongue until he found a way to fix it, but he again threatened to quit if I went through with it. 
Edit: From the feedback I'm getting I decided that I'm going to warn him to not do anything so stupid again and just ignore his threats if he does decide to go and do something like this again.

2. One of my PCs made a Goliath paladin who was specifically made because I told him I didn't want any giant or Goliath PCs in my campaign

Edit: I've been working on just simply making fun of his character through out the story just to mock him for his character choice. Hes been pretty dumb in the campaign so I'm going to have most of the NPCs treat him that way.

3. The same Goliath PC; after talking to an NPC who told him to steer clear of a certain 'fancy hunter for sport' NPC who I made as a higher level encounter

Edit: I decided due to one of the comments I'm going to beat the snot out of the Paladin (and any party member who decides to try and intervene) but not kill him out of him not putting up a real fight. As a result he will be mocked by the town when the hunter brings news of his feebleness.

4. One of my PCs only decision in any situation is to kill an NPC or to try and kill an NPC. While I could easily create repercussions to kill him or just say ""you can't do that"" I feel both ideas wouldn't be good solutions. 

Edit: We decided to not let him play in the next session

They told me they had fun in the last session we had and they want to play again

The party leader was a [Fey Corgi](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Setting:Unified_Setting/Corgyn) Warlord, and kobolds rounded our party out to be generally small sized. We adopted the name Minimus Maximus and proceeded to powergame without shame.

My character was a Kobold fighter

The notable incident happened, so by the time my turn came around, three party members were already on top of the dragon, which was flying around the city and generally breaking everything.

The DM informed me that a long rope hung from the canopy not far from where the dragon was flying past

So, or people who turn into robotic Morality Hunters, ""The Thief did a bad thing by pick pocketing the bartender.  My Paladin attacks him.""

I know this doesn't represent all DnD gamers AT ALL, Paladins' real world equivalents were warrior monks like Templars and Knights Hospitaller, and they sure as shit did morally questionable things.  Is butchering a thief morally questionable?  If a Drow Paladin always does what his goddess wants, never strays from his oath, and works to make his homeland stronger, can he be defined as evil?  (Maybe by his enemies, but from his peoples' perspective he's just a hardworking guy fighting for his city)  You'd think with the multitude of gods with different edicts, creeds

This brought me to a conclusion:  Paladins shouldn't have alignments; they should have Deity-specific codes.  With all of the different forms of ethics out there

Just for simplicity

""In Life: live by the law of the land and serve it well

In Others: Shepherd and lead the Weak

In Battle: Kill your enemies swiftly and Honor them as Foe

In Scorn:  Be wary disciples of Tiamat, Darkness with Light, and Malice with JUSTICE.""

With something like this, a purpose, and a reference for handling morally questionable situations.  Also, there is enough wiggle room in a code like this to explain why Paladins for Bahamut might sack a town or murder someone.  It's justice, but it might not be your justice.

http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1exp50/introducing_kids_to_the_game/

This weekend, Antike, Forbidden Island), and so Saturday night we sat down to our first game of D&amp;D. The issue, of course, is that my D&amp;D experience is very limited. I've really only seriously played in one game, and tried to DM a few times to no real success.

So with absolutely no experience amongh the four of us

**Myself** - as the easily amused Dungeon Master

**My Wife** - as Venom

**Albert** - the Dragonborn rogue (9)

**Lotso** - the Halfling Warlord. (7)

I had each of the players ""roll up"" a character sheet. That is, and walked through the races and classes for in the fourth edition players handbook and just had them pick whatever looked cool.

Then we rolled 4D6, we determined who the smartest player was in their group, who the fattest was, and who the strongest was.

The wife then got creative and made them some quick costumes. We made our halfling nephew fat, she turned off all the lights in the house, and lit candles. I'm told this made it ""even more spooky"".

We started with ""The Keep on the Shadowfell"", they were banging on the mayor's door looking for jobs to do. Just running with this, I sent them on a mission to rescue the mayor's daughter who was being held in a dungeon outside of town. Upon arriving at the dungeon entrance there was a giant spider they had to battle, followed by a trap-laden hallway and an ambush.

These are mostly just rough traps or trap concepts that prey on specific aspects of a party's adventuring style. I hope you all enjoy!

Antimagic Pulse: Every (1D4 +1) Rounds an antimagic pulse eminates from a generator (TBC) and dispels all magical effects on the characters as Greater Dispel. Suppresses effects of magical items.

Adamantine Warriors: Evil creatures bearing the Mark of a villain also wear corresponding amulets. (DC 30 to notice). 2 Rounds after being slain the Flesh of the creatures has turned to adamantium, and have hardness of 15.
 
Antimagic Assassins: Rogues with SR 25, NINJA) Equipped w/ Poison vs. Wisdom(or Charisma) 

The folly of greed: A PC picks up a well displayed valuable item. PC must make a will save DC 30) to let go. Item deals 1d4 wisdom damage per round until victim’s wisdom score is reduced to 0

Folly of pride: Allow PC’s two routes of escape, jump, swim, balance etc. The simple route begins very easily, allowing PC’s to easily pass the first several challenges (DC 5-7) and then ramping up difficulty greatly DC (15-20) until the DC’s of the checks are impossible to accomplish. Add unending stream of difficult monsters to force progression. Backtracking requires the PC’s to risk more combat.

Scrying Familiar: An invisible familiar stalks the party through a dungeon, who escapes, leaving a cursed item as a ‘prize’)

One way out: The PC’s become trapped in a room. The only way out is to spring an obvious and deadly trap. Upon being sprung

Folly of haste: The PC’s fight through a dungeon to the final chamber

Folly of Curiosity: PC’s making their way through a dungeon continually find switches that when activated cause a deep rumbling (Listen DC 25) but only appear to open small doors to minimal treasures. Once they reach the halfway point

Mind#@$&amp;: Players find an amulet that seems to bolster the abilities of a magic user. Upon equipping the amulet the character must make a Will Save (DC 30 +) To maintain control. Otherwise the DM takes control of the character uses them to send the party off track or to dangerous areas. Upon leaving the dungeon the amulet crumbles to dust. Benevolent DM’s may allow regular will saves from the character to regain control

I was given the reigns by the DM

When the game started I right away tried throwing them into the gauntlet, which they didn't like.  (I'm unfamiliar with Pathfinder as a 2nd ed. player so I couldn't compete with them on their level)

The story goes they reached a city that was undergoing a revolt.  There was a massive encampment of soliders outside the city.  They cowboyed right up to the leader and attacked him.  I begrudgling fudged the dice and let them win because I sensed if I didn't they would get pissy.

Finally they retreated back through the desert and two of them were killed by a monster.  I forget the name of the monster but it disguises itself as an Oasis and then eats you.  One of them failed the check and was swallowed up and died.  Another went cowboy and tried to save his friend alone

2. Tongue Ring of Slobberiness - *You drool a lot and it leaves a hole if you take it out*

6. Potion of Loudness - *Footsteps are also louder

**Level 3** *in which the items become slightly useful*

1. Bag of Coldness - *Like a fridge! Holds about as much as a grocery bag*

2. Potion of Sourness - *Works like sweet water

3. Encyclopedia of Useless Knowledge and Poor Ideas - *Unlimited charges!*

4. Potion of Bowel  Freeness - *Causes one to defecate their trousers. Makes a nice poison.*

5. Stone of Unusual Heaviness - *200lbs and about the size of your fist. Not cursed

6. Philter of Filtering - *Mostly for the name

**Level 4** *And so begins with useful items*

1. Bag of Song - *Filled with d10+5 charges

2. Telescoping Short Sword - *Can be just a hilt

3. Box of Featherfall - *50lb weight limit*

4. Magic Lock - *NO KEY! Once locked does not open. Resistant to all but the toughest of brute force

5. Wand of Gravity - *2 times gravity on items or monsters who have difficulty standing and can't really jump

6. Ball of Bouncing - *Big enough to sit on, and keeps bouncing unless someone stops it*

**Level 5** *Last one for today! Sorry!*

1. Gauntlets of Perceived Strength - *Looks to everyone like you have +3 to strength

2. Pebbles of Shaking - *Shake the room when thrown on the ground*

3. Ring of Calmness - *Makes one more chill whilst it is worn*

4. Potion of Highly Concentrated Alcohol - *Like 250 proof. I know that too much alcohol can kill you

5. Blessed Acorn - *When planted and watered, and crumples into dust by 6 hours, all seeds of this tree are normal acorns*

6. Lute of Pleasing - *You cannot strike an off chord

For extra creativity

I'll start us off:

1. ~~Use Light on the eye of an enemy to blind them.~~ **EDIT:** I've had it pointed out to me that since an eye isn't an object is almost 100% cases

2. Setting off a trap using Mage Hand.

3. Use Mage Hand to lift a skull in a dark cave and float it up in front of an enemy's face, or another scary sound, then dismiss the Light.

4. Use Prestidigitation to hide the taste of poison in wine when you need to poison somebody.

5. Know that asshole at the bar who you'd really like to beat the hell out of, and have the bartender serve it to the guy. When he's about halfway through a large gulp, then dismiss all three Prestidigitations. Now he's drinking piss.

6. Use Light to make a sneaky enemy's armour glow and make him easy to spot.

7. Make your tough-as-nails Fighter smell strongly like bubblegum just as he walks into a bar full of rowdy mercenaries.

8. Use Mage Hand to high-five yourself when your party leaves you hanging.

9. Use Object Projection (Wild Talent cantrip) after pickpocketing somebody to teleport whatever you took to a small chest hidden in a nearby house. If you get apprehended or accused

10. Got a target in a bar you need to take out? Give them a tankard of over-proof rum Prestidigitationed to look and taste like regular ale. Give it 10 minutes before they pass out and maybe die of alcohol poisoning.

11. Stuck out in the wilderness with nothing but a little bit of water? Just Prestidigitation it a few times to make it seem like beautiful

12. Use Mage Hand to untie ropes that are tying you up.

Mine is from one of my first times DMing. I hade DMd only a few sessions before I started a new campaign. I had 4 PCs, my wife who was also new, and another friend who was BRAND NEW.

So, but we really enjoy RPing, and just sinking in to the story. The Ranger, however, has another group of friends who are all about over the top crazy things (like a rogue in his other group sharing a story of bluffing gravity to not fall down a hole.) Now, remember, this is the Ranger's first time playing D&amp;D

So

The group was composed of;
Paladin - Lawful Good
Fighter - Neutral
Wizard - Good
Ranger - Neutral.

Now, how I want and not care about the outcome because I am neutral."" Which was the ranger's mindset. The campaign had been rolling for about 5 sessions by this point. The Ranger did nothing but mess with townsfolk, and basically be a munchkin in combat. Since the only combat player tend to see in D&amp;D is combat they're meant to win he grew a chip on his shoulder. He decided to go to the inn, get drunk, grope a barmaid, then pee in the corner. He kept doing things like this and I tried jailing him, fining him

It was clear the other PCs were angry with him

I had a guard escort him out of town, stab him, and knock him to under 0 HP from full in one hit. The goblin then planted a letter on him. I gave him a -11 to his death saving throw since he was lying in a puddle drowning so he was sure to die in 3 turns. However, luckily for him, the Paladin was returning from a hut down the road from the village, found him, and healed him (I knew this would happen and that the Ranger wouldn't actually die.) The Ranger awoke, it read;

""As a player you can do anything you want in D&amp;D. You are welcome to do whatever you want, and by fudging the numbers.""

He learned after that session that he was more than welcome to do crazy things

Your group will need to elect a Dungeon Master (DM) to run the game. The DM does not control a character, and quite a bit of creativity. It's easily the hardest job at the table, but I find that it can also be the most rewarding. They will be responsible for upholding the rules, and controlling NPC's, and telling the story.

You will also need to select an edition. 4th edition and Pathfinder are recommended for new players

---

**4th edition (4e)** is current edition, it's a great intro the game. It comes with simplified rules, pre-made characters, some dice, and a pre-written adventure to give you a good taste of how the game works.

The core rulebooks (Players Handbook, the core rulebooks have everything you need to create your own characters and write your own adventures.

The [DnD Encounters](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Event.aspx?x=dnd/4new/event/dndencounters) event series is an ongoing public campaign. It is an excellent introduction to DnD, and go check it out.

WotC recently published some [free quickstart rules and adventures](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1k9kwp/free_4ednd_quick_start_rules_and_adventure_pdfs/).

**3.5** is the previous edition. Originally 3.0, and many players find that there is an unfair power gap between spellcasters and non-spellcasters. I play this edition primarily, and many players try it after having played 4th edition for a while. Some change, and some don't; it's entirely personal preference. The core rules of the game available for free under the Open Gaming License, and can be found on the [d20 SRD](http://www.d20srd.org/). 

Should you choose to play this edition, and a Dungeon Master's guide. However, these books are currently out of print so you will likely need to get them on ebay or in a used books store.

WotC is running a brief [reprinting of the 3.5 source books](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20120625)

**Pathfinder (3.75)** is published by a third-party company called Paizo. It is a rules overhaul for 3.5 which addressed several major paint-points in the original game. It is a very popular ruleset, but it is a very well reviewed product and a great introduction to the game. It also includes a ""choose your own adventure"" style single-player adventure which can give you a good intro to the rules without needing a full game group.

Should you choose to play this edition

The full rules are also freely available from Paizo's [Pathfinder SRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/).

**Legacy Editions (AD&amp;D/2nd ed)** are still played by a handful of players who have been part of the hobby far longer than I have. These systems certainly have their flaws, in that the players themselves create the world in their minds, this can allow for a different type of role playing that some find more immersive. Due to the age of these editions the PHB/MM/DMG can sometimes be hard to come by and it is suggested that the players attempt to look on places like EBay or get a copy of OSRIC (Old School Reference &amp; Index Compilation). AD&amp;D had a huge influence on video game RPG's, and layed the groundwork for essentially every modern roleplaying game.

Note: WotC are running a brief reprint of the 1E material in the month of July (2012)

The players had only the class to go on but no idea if it was good or not. They ended up with Isa a Deva druid who was 2 million years old and only turned into dinosaurs

The plot was an evil wizard made a tower to protect a grand treasure and every time people tried to climb it the challenges they faced were entirely different. The only constant is that you needed four members and there was an inn nearby for people to LFG. The characters group up and after some hilarious character interaction they moved on to the tower itself.

The first challange was a relatively simple ten foot climb to the door which was locked but had four hand sized holes in the wall that they had to put their hands into and a needle stabbed them and then opened the door. Then a room with a load of empty boxes and chests to distract them.

They did panic when they entered a room and were immediately got crit by an attack that dazed them all and a roar came from a huge dragon that had obviously just assaulted their mind. There was worry and the first guy on initiative blew a daily and as soon as it hit the dragon illusion faded away.

After various challenges that were everything from a flooding room to a fight against two fire elementals in room full of ember moss they made it to what would effectively be the final boss room. There was a winding path around the room covered in ice that also went outside the tower at two points. Riven went off himself and the other three decided to go together. Riven got across pretty easy but about halfway Isa slipped and fell which pulled Kyrek down and in turn Xune so that all three of them where hanging by Xune's finger tips. Isa dropped to let Xune pull Kyrek up. Due to quick thinking Isa turned into a pterodactyl to serve as a parachute effect she just survived the fall and quickly found a load of switches that when turned on lit up the floor and started to heat the room. With the melted ice and a pretty simple climb back up it was a simple matter for everyone to assemble at the door.

Now the fun begins. Everyone started to bicker and Isa tried to blow everyone back into the room. At this point every turn anyone in the room had to start rolling endurance other wise start cooking in their armour. Riven managed to stay up but Kyrek and Xune fell down to the ground. Finally they all got into the corridor and kept fighting with Xune almost going down to Riven (including Riven using Mists of Madness to make Kyrek almost make the final blow) but then with Xune 1 damage away from death Riven critical failed and ended up killing himself.

After the in a warded desk written on a warded scroll (both of which blew up on them) were the words ""The TRUE treasure is the friendship gained from your journey""

When the party was climbing up some stairs to the roof of the fortress, and alas, and exclaimed ""Majestic Blue-billed Spotting Jay! I've found it at last."" The druid then rolled 20 twice on his diplomacy check (Think critting- it's an automatic success in my group) to automatically convince the Ogre he was a bird and that he ""no longer need be bound by such physical limitations

Just wanted to share. Thought it was pretty cool. ",,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/18u042/the_majestic_bluebilled_spotting_jay/
