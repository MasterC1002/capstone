To start: 

I checked in at the hotel yesterday and left my car overnight. I had to walk the valet guys through how the SMG works so they would know how to drive it and park it. 

The deal:

I have had a dash cam in my M5 for a few weeks. I picked it up as more of a novelty and prepping for the upcoming track day season. Once I test fitted it

TL:DR: I valeted overnight and the hotel valet burned some rubber

What would you do?

I'm pretty pissed. The video makes it look like a scene from Ferris Bueller.

I began developing some software to play music over the radio speakers using the steering wheel controls and more.
I have a guide on how to do it [here](http://blog.danielvagg.com/blog/?page_id=25)
The code is written in Python so fairly easy to change/tune

I am posting as I am reviving the project after I blew up the raspberryPi before Christmas! Hopefully it helps someone out there!

**EDIT 1:** Have just made it in to an Airplay speaker

**EDIT 2:** Direct link to the GIT repo: https://github.com/ezeakeal/pyBus
