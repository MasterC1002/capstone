I'm pretty excited about this game. I saw that video that was leaked recently. The one we're not supposed to talk about. You know what I thought? Looks cool. Players a bit special

Lately, has started to feel like an active war zone, dominated by a few extremely vocal, extremely pessimistic minorities. It seems to be mostly extremists: hardcore MMO raiders (who in my opinion are going to whine no matter what because if they really got what they're asking for they would whine about how it's a grindfest and/or just a copy of WoW) and, much less so on this subreddit but elsewhere on the web, hardcore TES lore scholars upset about some things we know to be redacted by the writers; these are the two I can think of off the top of my head, but I think there might be others.

I *think* I'm part of a majority of the community, we're not so extremist or passionate about one SINGLE aspect of a vast and inclusive game that we have that much to say besides, ""Eeee can't wait!"".

If I'm indicative

What are you still doing here? If you're so offended by one aspect of this very big, and ignore it, and play games you do like? Why make such a scene?

The rest of us just want to talk about cool things,False,self,t5_2tqi0,False,,,t3_1cers3

Also this is not a Beta information thread. Only for facts that are released by Zenimax Online. 



					**The World:**

* The entire continent of Tamriel
* Not all areas will be available at launch
* each area will be as large as they are in the other ES games.

				**The Alliances(Factions):**

* All three factions are battling for control of a single PVP area


* Aldemeri Dominion

 * Altmer(High Elf)
 * Bosmer(Wood Elf)
 * Khajiit

* Daggerfall Covenant

 * Breton(Human/elf)
 * Redguard(Human)
 * Orc

* Ebonheart Pact

 * Nord(Human)
 * Dunmer(Dark Elf)
 * Argonian


				**Game Systems:**


Combat:

* All classes will have Health
* Secondary stats will include weapon
* Classes are loose systems that will get you started down your path
* Combat actions will have no cooldown
* Combat actions will cost stamina
* Combat will be the balance of managing the stamina and magica resources
* All classes will be able to use stamina to break stuns
* Players will have access to an 'ultimate move' after filing the 'Finesse' bar
* Combat is intended to be about strategy
* Targeting will be a combination of free aim and soft lock. Attacks are still subject to the classic damage modifier that other MMOs use. A swing is a hit
* Any class can use any weapon/armor combination

PVP:

* PVP will be done completely in the area of the imperial province.  The city will be locked on release.
* They will be cut into “Campaigns”. Likely timed battles you will be locked into until the battle completes. This will help avoid battle jumpers. 
* There will be no open world PVP in leveling zones. Factions are locked to their areas.
* The faction that conquers the PVP city will have an “Emperor”
* The faction that controls the PVP city will get a yet undefined reward.
* There will be a PVP progression system - [Matt Firor iterview] (http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2013/jan/29/elder-scrolls-online-characters)


PVE:

* There will be dungeons and hard mode dungeons
* “Raids” look like they will be in open world and dungeon PVE areas built for Solo
* “Smart AI” enemies will not just sit and watch you kill their friends without attacking. This differs from the area of attack and leash model other MMOs use.

Questing:

* Questing is open. You can get a quest, go pick up another one you happen to find on the way.
* Questing will have tangible results in the game world. This is done via phasing
* Any player
* There is a Mage Guild that you gain favor by collecting books in the world
* There is a Fighters guild as well. Breaking ""Dark Anchors"" gains favor
* Other guilds will be available post release

Guilds:

* Players will be able to join multiple guilds
* Likely cross faction guilds as well

Other:

Crafting:

* Very little is know of crating at the moment.
* Smithing
* Interviews have hinted that it will be the known crafting style of Skyrim
* Orcs “weapons and armor are prized by warriors everywhere “


					**Plot:**

* The character learns immediately that their Soul has been stolen by a currently unknown force. This is the driving force behind the death/rebirth * system that all MMOs have
* the Daedric Prince Molag Bal is the primary antagonist of the main Plot.
* A magical explosion took place

I have noticed recently that many people come on here asking questions and that nobody wants to help, I have experienced issues using the search function before and it's not very user friendly.  

That being said... When people come here to ask a question we don't need people criticizing or getting angry

If you have questions feel free to ask them. If you are answering questions be polite about it

So again

Be friendly that's all I think we should be doing right now. 

We can take a prime example from World of Warcraft and looking at how the community has gone to shit over the past few years. A new expansion comes out everybody comes back and there's a lot of new content to learn

If you look at Guildwars 2 and how many people are coming in and out of that community and look at the PVP system and everything (the groupings and the teamwork and the community as a whole) it is all very friendly and very user-friendly and has a lot of support behind it. It's a strong community

Let's learn from past mistakes that other communities have made and fix them

This is very important considering a big name companiy like Zenimax studios or in this case Zenimax Online Studios/Bethesda (part of their team is working with ZOS) have come together to create a great game

Stop being snobs

What goes around comes around

Thanks for your time.

In order to make sure your players engage with the game world and each other as little as possible, then going AFK while your character soars through the open sky towards its destination. Who wants to discover new caves or engage in random PvP when you could be eating some chips instead?

**2. Allow fast-travel to become the main mode of transportation.**
There's that pesky open world again, fast-travel should be there to let you skip that annoying content so you can get to the next piece of epic loot ASAP. Participate in whatever end-game content you want, all from the comfort of your favorite major city!

**3. Tailor the game to meet the needs of solo players.**
Just because it's an MMO doesn't mean people actually need to socialize. You should do everything in your power to make sure there are very few benefits to forming guilds or friendships with new people. Allow players to join a queue for group PvE and PvP content

This entire announcement just pissed me off honestly. I know being this sub-reddit this will probably get downvoted into the negatives

On a game this large, and now they push it back. Seriously, this better not because they have to port to consoles because papa Zenimax is telling them to make as much money as possible. Also, ESO better not have console watered down graphics. I know the *next-gen* consoles have updated hardware, but most gaming grade PCs are already generations faster. I don't want low resolution textures and a console optimized UI on my PC(Skyrim). They just took a huge turn south for me.

* Beta is beta

Being a beta tester isn't all fun and games

* The subreddit **will** change after launch

I can't stress this enough. The GW2 subreddit was a peaceful interactive place where everyone was bursting with fan art

* Too much media can be a bad thing

I used to check the GW2 subreddit 15 times a day. I would watch every video I could find on youtube and Gamebreaker Tv, can ruin the game for you.

* A happy community makes a game better

This game will be pulling in a lot of players who are fans of the ES games and may not have any MMO experience. This may lead to some seriously whiny and generally inexperienced players. I'm a little worried about this myself

1371053559.0,1g7beo,I got two hours on ESO at E3 and spoke with Paul Sage from Zenimax.,xaraan,81,10,27,"First

(I'm coming from an Elder Scrolls background, there seemed to be a bit more going on in the cities, it felt a bit better than the somewhat empty feeling of Skyrim's cities.  (I started in Daggerfall, playing a Breton Dragonknight, they had three tables set up, one for each faction.)

The graphics looked good (we've all seen a bit online before, details, scenery, everything looked great.  I think for me, it felt like a mix of 75% Skyrim and 25% Fables in the feel of the graphics (which was fine for me being that I loved both games).  Everyone has their own opinions, but considering what they have to work with in building an MMO, I thought the graphics were fine.

Gameplay felt good, wolves, spriggans, and some sort of flying imps.  After fighting them more than once, you did get a very predictable set of actions to expect from them.  I don't know if AI is still being worked on, but for now there wasn't a lot of change in tactics to how they fight - though that change may come more when facing larger groups instead of just a single player.

Interaction with other players worked alright.  One player using a sorcerer was in the same area as me at one point so we helped each other out as we made our way through the assassins.  He died at one point, chests, or killed villains, you both get to loot/speak/interact with them separately.  So no one can steal your loot after a kill.  But I did notice if you ran up and helped someone with a fight, just to land a blow or two, you would not get any loot option, which seems fair.

As for view, dealing with the targeting was fairly easy.  I did play in first person for a little bit, but they still don't have the animations built in for this build, so it was a bit odd no seeing my weapon yet.  They also offered the option of zooming in or out, so if you want to have the camera set further back in 3rd person to see a lot of what's going on around you, or right up (almost) over your shoulder, you had choices there.

I think I covered everything I could think of

I'm sure we will all hear any big news coming out of E3 everywhere, the game will not be dumbed down for console.  With the new consoles, they will run games better than most average PCs of today, remember, (ESO is not being targeted at only high end PCs) so with the game coming out during a new console launch it gave them an option that wasn't there before,  ie, not something they would try on 360 or PS3.  I can't see how ESO coming to console is bad, with the end result being the game will be supported better for PC.

When talking to him about 50+ content, even if they are on your friends list, in other faction territory.  So if you want to play with a friend in a different faction you will have to make up a character in their faction.  The quests will be very similar to what you would get in that faction, just on a whole other level of difficulty.  So if you had played in that faction with a starting character, you may see an almost identical quest, just expect it to be much more difficult.  

Things they could not answer yet.  Still no solid answer on multiple characters, I asked, with the console announcement, does it mean they've decided how the pay structure will work on PC and got a negative on that one as well.",,False,self,False,t3_1g7beo

1375716696.0,1jqt8e,I played for 30 minutes at QuakeCon this year. AMA,grimdeath,78,16,97,"Bethesda had a booth setup at QuakeCon this year allowing attendees to play for up to 30 minutes. While my playtime was limited I'll do my best to answer any questions you might have.

I'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan that's played since Morrowind. I'm familiar with a lot of the lore, and Warhammer online.

A few random tidbits:

* I played an Argonian Sorcerer
* I primarily played first person
* The class added three additional trees of skills to my skill screen, and one other tree I didn't use. I think it was a form of healing. I recall one spell called Blood Magic or something like that.
* My character started with a small sword or dagger and a shield. Both of which I used when my Magika was too low to cast.
* The demo took place on a small island which was part of Skyrim.
* As shown in the live stream
* I was able to complete one of two quests I was given. The first involved gathering 12 claws from some sort of bat/demon like winged creatures. The second was better, eagle symbols from Skyrim) at three shrines near the ruins/burrow. Then talk with a Dragon Priest ghost to gain entry to the ruins. Inside the burrow was a small area that featured a few mobs, including a Necromancer the Priest wanted you to defeat. He was fairly easy for me and my buddy to dispatch. The ruins interior appears to be instanced.
* Towards the end of the demo me and my friend decided to just run and explore. We followed the coastline and discovered a ""Prodigious Mudcrab"" which dropped an Ice Staff for me. The staff could shoot quickly by tapping left click or charge up and shoot a larger attack which was really cool.

Now, read my entire post, it's the least you can do.

Jungle Cyrodil change:

Now the first point, this is a weak retcon, but let's look at why it makes sense.

Something people ignore repeatedly is that Bethesda has retconned as well, but fit perfectly. How you ask? CHIM. GODHEAD, and dragonbreaks. All these metaphysical properties people love so much are implemented in lore so Beth have a way out when it comes to messy lore, and how does this work? Beth only moves forward in time, not back like ZOS. So while ZOS has to deal with the tangles of going back, Beth can continue to move forward.

Now I will stop rambleing about the metaphysical being a tool for the developer as that could be a post of it's own. Back to why it's acceptable in ESO. In 1998 Redguard was released with the first edition of the guide to the empire. As said this is the one people quote. Now from a lore standpoint this means little

Fast forward to 2006 and we have Oblivion, their get out of jail free card.

Now as for ZOS, brought a large number of people into the franchise. In fact the majoraty of ES fans came in at Morrowind or later. And, if they do not go into MK's writings and such and all this external metaphysical nonsense, they would have no idea that Cyrodil used to be a jungle. So to appease this majoraty demographic of people ZOS had to make the call to keep Cyrodil as it is in oblivion.

Honestly

Now the second point

This one boggles my mind when I see people saying this breaks the lore

It's a game mechanic simple as that. And if you want a logical reason why? Well war looting. War looting has been a thing since war was invented essentially. It's a simple thing but t makes perfect sense, whether it be resources, wealth, or in the case of an Elder Scroll information, not to mention something beyond the mortal mind.

Want examples of common war looting in history?
After the siege of Constantinople in 1204
Between 1804 and 1814 Napoleon Bonaparte engaged in massive looting in Europe.

And finally the most recent example:

During World War II

And so there you have it. People in the real world loot things less valuable then the Elder Scrolls. As for the stat bonus they give? Moral boost. if your nation stole something that was part of creation

So for this one I personally find this a moot complaint

And now the final point the Ebonheart pack

This one also boggles my mind as again, and yes, some have actively been at war.

Does this make their alliances make any less sense? Absolutely not.

Now I would put down a list of examples, that hated each other, is really something, if you haven't I'd recommend reading up on it as it really is very interesting.

Now sometimes people aren't worried about alliances during the game, during this time America and Russia were allies, huh well that's odd, they weren't on good terms. Oh but after the war relations went back to as they were, hostile and well, we all know what happens after.



And so there we have it y'all. One retcon that was needed to please the majority over the minority of the playerbase (an unfortunate part of game design)

Now no doubt the comments will devolve into people saying how wrong I am and how this game has ruined the lore

For one, but they were smart enough to build in a system of lore that let them get away with sneaky edits. As well in 98 they couldn't have known that an mmo would be released in 2013.

Now ZOS is not an entity unto itself, I mean at Pax east next week ZOS doesn't even get their own booth to show the game, they are showing it, you guessed it, in Bethesda's booth. So it's safe to assume some of Beth is involved with the making of this game, so if you dislike the changes, some blame has to be put on Beth too honestly.

And so I just want to say, but a practical issue and how these human beings are treating it.

And finally, that's like trying to judge the quality of the main campaign, or the amount of end game before it is released, we do not know, and it is unfair to make such judgments.

Now I hope you have read this all and if you have thank you. There are a few other points I will talk about in a comment below

TL;DR read the damned thing. That's how discussions work.

**What is ESO?**

Elder Scrolls Online is the next installment of the Elder Scrolls franchise in MMO form. It has been stated that it will be an Elder Scrolls game first

**Who is making it?**

It is being made by Zenimax Studios rather than Bethesda

**What is the payment model?**

We don’t know it yet

**Will there be co-op?**

Yes, or just play side by side with a random player. When you wish to play PvP, you simply go into the province of Cyrodiil where the Alliance War will take place. AvA is the initialism for this, Alliance vs. Alliance.

**What will AvA be like?**

In Cyrodiil

**Who are the Tharns?**

The Tharns are the current ruling body on the ruby throne. Clivia Tharn is the empress regent, is the chancellor of the elder council. They are secret Daedra worshippers. They enlist the aid of the Daedra and the necromancer Mannimarco, Molag Bal’s agent in Tamriel to defend themselves against the growing alliances surrounding Cyrodiil.

**Do we fight the Tharns?**

So far there is no information about that

**What’s the story of the alliances?**

Cyrodiil is a large province in the center of Tamriel. Each of the young alliances wishes to gain control of Cyrodiil because it’s a symbol of power over the continent. The alliances have various reasons to take control of Cyrodiil. They are the Daggerfall Covenant

**Daggerfall Covenant**

The Daggerfall Covenant consists of Bretons, he thinks the empire is weak, and there will be peace when it is strong. In short, he wants the humans to take back control to keep the elves out.

**Ebonheart Pact**

The Ebonheart Pact consists of Nords, a Nord, leads the Ebonheart Pact. Almalexia, one of the living gods of the tribunal and representative of the Dunmer, feels they must stop the Daedra as they are a threat to Nirn.

-Thanks to /u/Nokutisu for pointing out the true leader of the Pact

**Aldmeri Dominion**

The Aldmeri Dominion consists of the High Elves, and kick out the humans who are warmongering and self-destructive.

**What areas of Tamriel will be available to exploration?**

[This is a fan-made map of where you can most likely explore. UPDATED FOR ACCURACY]( http://i.picresize.com/images/2013/01/23/eRlkj.jpg) As it is very lengthy to explain

**How will magic work?**

“Magic in ESO will behave much more like Oblivion wherein you can still cast a fireball from a hand with a sword in it. In ESO, except now in ESO, there is a concept of holding down the attack button with a staff to make the staff cast a more powerful attack.
Example: A Destruction staff may shoot 1

**Can I play with a friend playing a race from a different faction?**

Unfortunately no, but you cannot fight alongside them. When you reach the level cap in your territory, you have the option to proceed to another territory.

**What do we know about dungeons?**

[For all the information you need

[This is a previous article on the official page

**How does fast travel work?**

There will be some price (non-disclosed) when using shrines

**Classes**

There will be Templars, and Nightblades at launch. That being said, these are just starting points when building your character. You can put skills in your character however you want to progress them. These classes will have specific abilities, but for the most part you can build your character how you want.

**Weapons**

There will be one-hand, destruction staves, restorations staves, bows, and shields at launch. Unfortunately there will neither be spears or crossbows, nor unarmed combat as far as we know. They could be added later.

**Armor**

“The Elder Scrolls Online features a very familiar armor system. Armor is divided into 3 categories: light, and heavy armor is good for keeping yourself alive as long as possible. Within each category, there are many different types available; some are specific to a particular racial style (though you can wear any armor regardless of your race), and some are the iconic sets you might recognize from past Elder Scrolls games such as Daedric, Dwemer, and more.”

**How will the inventory system work?**

[Slot based

**How will the combat UI work?**

[There is a hot bar with 6 total abilities: 5 regular and 1 ultimate. These cannot be changed in combat but can be changed outside of combat. You will have a main attack on left click

**Will there be crime?**

At launch there will be no crime system

**Will there be mounts?**

[There will only be horses. You can upgrade your horses in various ways like increased bag space, and normal speed. No mounted combat as of yet. This link leads to a quick interview source for information on mounts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NTq77x-rH-k&amp;t=272)

**Will there be dragons?**

No there will not be dragons

**Is everyone on the same server?**

Playstation gamers will have their own server, though probably in shards or what have you.

[*EDIT: OperaNero pointed out that it has been mentioned that there will be a megaserver in each region, albeit you may find some latency involved.*](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/07/29/ask-us-anything-roleplaying)

**Can we use controllers on PC?**

[No

**Getting into the beta**

[Apply at the beta application page.]( https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/beta) Some people have gotten confirmation emails

EDIT: [This post just made it to the front page of our subreddit. Thanks to /u/Vinshati for the information! Apparently they are not always receiving our information when we sign up. Read this post for extra information. That being said

**How will combat work?**

“To put it simply the game feels like an Elder Scrolls game. You have to manually attack using your spells and melee weapons. You also have to manually block; you can parry as well on some of the attacks. The combat might feel a little clunky at first but you get used to it and when you get very good at it

“It is just like Skyrim really except that ranged combat (bows and ranged spells and the like) are mostly auto aimed (you have to point at the target, switch weapons, think about what to do next, etc.” - /u/erlexx

**Explain lock picking**

[There will not be a skill tree for lock picking but it will skill level as your character levels. The locks will be more similar to those of Oblivion rather than Skyrim. They will range in difficulty like previous Elder Scrolls games. If you fail

**Explain gathering and exploration**

[All is explained here. Check both this page and the link where it says *new video* in the first sentence of this link.](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/05/20/ask-us-anything-gathering-and-exploration)

1366506114.0,1crvst,Rewarding Elitist Accomplishments in TESO,squidmanphilosopher,57,13,67,"Yesterday, and how cool of a concept it was to become this vehemently overpowered character who has to retain some semblance of anonymity and not flaunt his powers or weapons in order to survive. This added an element to the game that not many other games provide; reality. Not everyone has the same opportunities, but to a lesser degree. It really just comes down to rewarding hard work and making it so that not everyone has access

Before I address how TESO could make this work, in my opinion, enables this self-entitled attitude in people that if they bitch about something enough, they can get whatever they want. I understand that most players are casual, and you need to please them; I am no an elitist. I was never Scarab Lord, nor did I ever become a Jedi. But the potential of becoming one was overwhelmingly cool, and it helped immerse me in ways that I don't even think I can communicate. 

So, and that could be implemented in cool ways. The same goes for becoming the Emperor of Cyrodil (not sure if your faction leader becomes Emperor or a player does, if someone could clear that up for me that'd be cool). Once again, this would have to be something that not everyone could do. It's unrealistic if everyone is Dragonborn, just how it's unrealistic when everyone is ""THE HERO"" (a common theme in MMO's nowadays). Set up prerequisites, and reward the hard work.

Before you make a judgement about this game which in truth

***Do I really want a game that truly breaks the MMO mold

If the answer is the latter, and entertaining. But we've been there before, and no matter what it will be called a clone.

If you are into trying something new, ""Do i really want the same?"" Part of me does, and part of me doesn't.

The crux of all the interviews and info released so far is that they want to make their own original system. Matt  Firor said himself that they tell themselves not to follow the standard MMO archetypes. They seem to have a holy trinity system, who knows? They do tend to listen to the community.

tl;dr: The developers are doing everything they can to make this mmo an original. In the months leading up to the game

The game released. 

People had their own preconceived notions of how X was going to work or how Y would look, a lot of this falls onto the shoulders of you. Speculation if **fine**, but you need to remember that no matter how cool it sounds, or how well it could work in game, it's still *just speculation*.

Beware the honeymoon period. When BL2 launched, then the world record (30 second) terra solo, and people freaked out because the majority of us where still leveling through our first playthrough, which brings me to my next point.

What other redditors did/can do/are doing is neither the standard nor the rule, or ""better"" than you does not mean that you're bad. It just means that they've played more/had better luck with gear/rushed/cheated. You are you, they aren't. Do NOT be afraid to sit back and smell the roses, enjoy the dialog the quest giver has, chat with another player And trade some gear. That's what gaming, especially co-op and MMO games are all about. 

And now, and gankers in that one zone do suck, but whining on reddit won't help. A great example, which I can really think of as the turning point in the Borderlands' fall from grace would be, ""The Bee"". The bee was a (being completely honest) absurdly overpowered shield with a bonus that made it possible to kill terramorphous (the ""hardest"" enemy at release) solo in less than a minute. Many people loved this. Now they could faceroll for the best loot, but other purists screamed nerf so that the difficult content was actually difficult. Regardless of your opinion on the matter, the whining and bickering tore that subreddit apart and it never quite recovered.

Anyways /rant.

**Answers to Common Questions**

A few answers to some of the most common or repeated questions asked in this subreddit. Most material taken from /u/beginner-'s wonderful [Elder Scrolls Online FAQ thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1j48pc/the_elder_scrolls_online_faq/)

**What is ESO?**

Elder Scrolls Online is the next installment of the Elder Scrolls franchise in MMO form. It has been stated that it will be an Elder Scrolls game first

**Who is making it?**

It is being made by Zenimax Studios rather than Bethesda

* Matt Firor - Game Director
* Paul Sage - Creative Director
* Brian Wheeler - Lead PvP Designer

**What is the payment model?**

We don’t know it yet

**When is it releasing?**

According to the [most current official information](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/06/10/eso-on-next-gen-consoles-and-new-gameplay-trailer)

**Getting into the beta**

[Apply at the beta application page](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/beta). Some people have gotten confirmation emails

**What's the status of beta?**

Elder Scrolls Online is currently in closed beta under a Non-Disclosure Agreement for its participants. There is no news of open beta at this time.

**Will there be co-op?**

Yes, or just play side by side with a random player. When you wish to play PvP, you simply go into the province of Cyrodiil where the Alliance War will take place. AvA is the initialism for this, Alliance vs. Alliance.

**What will AvA be like?**

In Cyrodiil

**Which Classes Can I Play?**

There will be Templars, and Nightblades at launch. That being said, these are just starting points when building your character. You can put skills in your character however you want to progress them. These classes will have specific abilities, but for the most part you can build your character how you want.

**Will there be dragons?**

No there will not be dragons

**Is everyone on the same server?**

Playstation gamers will have their own server, though probably in shards or what have you. Each region (NA/EU) will have separate megaservers.

Also, and polish up a long list of other things. Perhaps you now have enough time to add the thieves guild and a fully implemented crime system at launch?

Although I will be playing ESO on my PC

That said

Lastly you really need to make sure that your game has something unique because I've played Neverwinter and it seems that they beat you to the punch. They have very similar style of combat. So you really have to think critically about what is going to set your game apart from the other games that are in this Genre. Having a high quality true TES first person combat will go a very long way to keep players feeling immersed and make the game feel unique. 

One reason why I stopped playing other MMOs was because I did not take them seriously as a premium product I could see myself playing long term. This is mostly because the lore behind the game was sparse and I did not feel immersed. That's one reason why WoW was so successful was because of the depth of lore behind it

A lot of people myself included are watching this game and we think your game is either going to be a massive success, having oodles of meaningful end game progression content for both pve and pvp can go a long way to keeping people hooked and retaining subscribers, but it is the experience, the total immersion in the world of Tamriel, that is your #1 selling point.

it's a very good at explaining basically what the NDA consists of and that it's a fairly standard one. But i wanted to point out some stuff that i feel like he missed(and echo some he said) in a very simple and straight forward way. And mostly in terms of what you need to do to KEEP you in the BETA.

* If you get in, Nudge Nudge. Talk to you at launch!"" That could get you booted.

* Feedback becomes theirs: If you make an amazing suggestion or feedback regarding some aspect of the game, and just maybe they will internally know who you are and what you said that got something changed.

* in regards to the verbiage about badmouthing the game: This obviously applies to on the internet and in the media. But even more so, ""This beta is  shit, how do you expect to make a profit on this shitty game!?!&gt;!"" or ""OMG why haven't you fixed this gamebreaking bug. do your jobs."", you will likely find yourself out of beta. 

* in regards to and screenshots: Don't take them. Chances are the in game bug reporting tool takes one and other information when you submit. Don't take them. Don't take them

This is pretty much it. The NDA is straight forward. Say NOTHING. Plain and simple. 

The privileged of beta is making the game better, but in the end if they decide not to give a gift, that would be fine too.

(This is known) I would love to see a mechanic that allows players to offer contracts on other players of either the same alliance or an opposing one but that's not all I think the player issuing the contract should have the option to add a bonus to the contract such as bringing the head of the victim back for a few extra gold and the player who issued the contract can have the head of the individual he had killed as a reward. (I would personally put hits out on all of my friends and be rengar up in this bitch) I think a mechanic that auto flags the target would make the prey aware that he is being hunted but also make it so that the db assassin can kill his prey in any location. This would be an interesting mechanic to say the least and seems as if it would be simple to implement if there will also be same alliance duels just a simple tweak of dueling can make this assassins fantasy a reality!!,t5_2tqi0,True

Please remember, or it's just a common consensus that 'that's how it'll be done', the more we passively or aggressively support an unofficial system the more likely it's to not be changed/removed (when necessary). They are reading what we say, and they are trying to figure out what we want.

For example, among many other things. When many found out this was not the case, a shit storm occurred, we now have first person, but we forced the developers to implement this. Hooray for first person, but this isn't always a good thing for us or for the devs. This most likely draws from their resources elsewhere which will over all hurt the game and the pipeline for their work. 

We don't want another SWTOR now do we?? Let's let them finish the game and not have to worry about meeting new expectations we set by revealing key bits of information and leading others to believe this is permenant. Your words can do a lot more damage then you think

TL;DR: Remember YOU got invited to beta test to give them your input! You are the voice of what features TESO could have. Implanting an idea into the community that something will be in the game will only deter Zenimax from improving, especially when the community becomes vocal about the system, or everyone starts off-handlely saying it's going to be in the game.

What should we worry about and then? Anything core mechanics related. Did you enjoy or dislike the way the different skill trees worked, and thus they do have to step aside from traditional TES games to make it work.

What should we not worry about? Polish. Any animations, it felt a bit strange with the animations as the guy switched between his bows and the spells, with the animation canceling early to switch over. Some of the attack visuals felt a bit off as well, and the sounds in battle seemed repetitive. This is not something to worry about though! Most of these seem to be temporary place holders. As the core game is finished and balanced, they will be touching these up and putting a bow on everything. 

TL;DNR: Don't worry about the little things, or textures just yet. If you wish to share your thoughts, put much more weight on the mechanics of the game, stories, voice acting, and other core game elements.

I would like to hear what you guys think.

I have not been in the Betas

**Facts:**

As of this post(10:20 am EST April 23) we have had 2 beta events. 

* Invites Tues March 26 for 30/31 event
* Invites Tues/Wed April 9/10 for 13/14 Event

**My Theory:** 

Amendment 1(5/1/13) - been a few weeks since an event. Next event will have large changes in the gameplay to reflect data and feedback from the 2 events.

That schedule puts us on for invites to ~~go out this evening~~. I fail

If this schedule keeps up with expanding groups

* Bi weekly beta events through the **middle of June**

* **Mid june
* **mid summer**, etc. Occasional wipes, but long term goals and players will be used.
* **Early September** will see a broad invite heavy test of Cyrodil. This will still be covered under NDA
* **Late September** or early October will see open beta and Stress test. NDA is lifted. 

All of this leads to a late November release

So a small question: for you


For me
Single target healing spells necessitate that we almost create a small 'rotation' for our healing
In PvP scenarios this is especially challenging and fun, don't get me wrong, but if there are single target damage abilities with soft targeting, there should be single target healing abilities with soft targeting.
Why? Because its fucking fun to skill shot heal specific people


I personally think it's a huge mistake to have a simplistic healing model similar to Guild Wars 2. Not hating on the game

I am fully aware of the fact that first person perspective is how nearly everyone has played Elder Scrolls games in the past

The fact of the matter is when playing with groups of people in any MMO situational awareness is of the utmost importance. First person perspective by its very nature severely limits your moment to moment awareness. While engaging in combat you simple cannot see what is taking place to your sides or behind you

Certainly people could spin around in circles to see what is taking place...but when doing that, and has you facing only a few enemies (1-3) at any given time. This is easy to manage while just seeing what is in front of you, my expectation however (and this may be wrong) is that like most other MMO's, ESO group play will include a higher volume of enemies and dangers to be avoided (fire, traps, additional mob spawns) then what we've seen in other Elder Scrolls games, which will make first person perspective inefficient and ineffective. 

This all leads me to believe

The gates were spread wide and far with many a castle/capturable points in between. (Note: the castle raids could take hours, but were so satisfying.)

The 3-faction system is incredible because it breaks the mundane mold of fighting for control points, and pure fun (not to mention the rivalries and notoriety formed between factions and by individually strong/sneaky players).

When you played Borderlands 2, your last weapon of use will be resting on your back.

The Elder Scrolls sample is found in the Skyrim mod ""armed to the teeth"". You're able to equip all your weapons at once and look like an arsenal of bad-ass (mule :P).
For me, what type of character I might be.
But how should it work? Well pretty easy in my opinion. If you have two twohanded you'll have them as an X on your back when you don't wield them.

For example, or do you try out the new plan you discovered and have a sword that looks exactly the same except it has a different style pommel?

As you travel across Tamriel, however it incorporates an Orcish cross-guard that you learned from an Orcish smith.  Or perhaps you use an Elven handle with a Khajit blade.  The possibilities are limitless.

I'm not sure if this is not possible for some technical reason

I just feel this would make smithing so much more fascinating and introduce all sorts of possibilities.  Instead of crafting a generic sword

**EDIT 1:**

This is the current list. Please give them a look and let me know if I have any wrong or incomplete information, but I'm hesitant to listen to the whole two hours this late at night. I will certainly do so over the weekend if no one else finds it.

**When will beta start?**

We don't know at this time

**Are races restricted to one faction?**

Yes, the Bretons, Redguards and Orcs belong to the Daggerfall Covenant, and the High Elves, Wood Elves and Khajiit belong to the Aldmeri Dominion.

**Are the Imperials a playable race?**

No

**Can a race leave their faction?**

No

**Are the territories faction locked?**

At this time territories are faction locked.

**Will there be PvP outside of Cyrodiil?**

There will be no PvP outside of Cyrodiil at launch.

**How big are the zones?**

There has been no official statement on the size of the game world.

**How will the controls work?**

WASD will control movement

**Will the holy trinity be in the game?**

*I need more info on this

**What will the system specs be?**

They have not yet been announced.

**Will the game be available for Mac?**

Yes

**What is finesse?**

Finesse is a resource that builds as a character performs well in combat

**What is Synergy?**

Some skills have synergy. This means that a group member can perform special actions when your skill is in effect. An example of this is a channeled AOE lightning field cast by a mage that a warrior can enter and use to cast a powerful direct damage attack. Enemies are also able to utilize this.

**How will stealth work?**

A stealthed character will be rendered invisible to enemy NPCs and Players. At a certain range the character will become visible but obscured. When attacked

**Will the game be in first or third person?**

Both, but the developers warn that respawns make this view dangerous.

**Will there be raids?**

The developers have stated there will be raids,False,self,t5_2tqi0,1359181794.0,,,t3_17a932

The entire development team for ESO should be extremely familiar with EverQuest. I am not afraid to wager that many of them (including Matt and Paul) played it when it came out and for a very long time after. I would like to urge them to revisit that game's pickpocketing mechanic and argue that it is proof pickpocketing can be included in ESO without making interpersonal relationships as complicated as they think.

While pickpocketing in EQ was at first exactly the bit of a problem child Matt is thinking it can be

I played abit of Morrowind, Skyrim came out in 2011.

Say anyone who bought skyrim between the ages of 15-20 might not have played oblivion

So, they were 15. I doubt they were playing oblivion when they were 10.

I'm not saying everyone

So for alot of people

If they were a pc gamer, Elder Scrolls looked like this: http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/11/iBnczUueCozRc.jpg
Where as for me

Again

Somewhere, and the one with the Nords (i forget the name) is the largest by like 10-20%.

Another point to factor in is that Skyrim is slightly odd compared to other ES games.

I can only really talk for Oblivion, you got lucky and escaped and got caught up the Tiber Septum storyline thing. 
Tiber was the magic hero coming from modest background and he was the ""chosen one."" 
Skyrim you WERE the chosen one with a modest background.
Any decent writer will tell you that in fantasy, old hat and ridiculous.
Oblivion (and i presume to some stretch
My point is, you are the chosen one you have to do this!"" Where as the rest felt less forced. I know Skyrim you could go anywhere, but i've spoken to a few and i'm not the only one who thinks this.

This is where my theory all comes together. I have a feeling, beautiful looking Skyrim game where you are the dragonborn. So to them, yes the graphics look AWFUL, i mean why would anyone play it?! And to them, the Dragonborn is amazing, and is a nord (by the official videos/screenshots ect), so they will all want to be Nords. The nord thing only helps strengthen my idea the hate is coming from jumped up pc teenagers (here on known as JUPT)

So yes, the gameplay isnt ""traditional ES"", aka: Skyrim.
But to everyone else

TL:DR:- I think the hate is coming from ES gamers who only experiance has been Skyrim

this is the part of the conversation that i want you guys/girls to discuss about. Do you think its a good idea for a faction to be able to be completely pushed out of Cyrodil. Remember to take an Elder Scrolls from another faction you will probable need an army and siege another factions main keep. In order for an army to even get that far you will probably have to push a faction all the way back to their main base or you risk that faction becoming able to spawn at a keep that's at your back. Effectively trapping the army in between a keep and another army. So it's a good idea to take out all the keeps on the way to the main fortress each faction will possess.

The schools of Alchemy and Enchanting are crafting professions should translate really well from other TES games
Same could probably be said about the other schools as well I guess. 

Well now to the reason I made this post: Personally I'm a big fan of the Illusion school, Courage, and Rage spells work in a PvP environment? Like buffs and debuffs? What about Invisibility?  Or sneaky for that matter. Yes they've said sneaking is in the game and that you get a bonus when striking from behind, but how will that translate into PvP? It's a lot easier to sneak around a NPC than it is around a player, even more so a player in 3rd-person? They said a player is harder to see when sneaking so does that mean that sneaking gives a innate level of invisibility or translucency? Which brings me back to the schools of magic, if sneaking makes you harder to see then will you still be able to use Invisibility spells or potions? Will the Muffle spell be in the game? Will we be able to get a perk to secretly cast spells while sneaking like in Skyrim?
One thing I would love to see is the Illusion school make actual illusions

To fill in a bit for the less lore-knowledgeable among us, Altmer, Dunmer, and Dwemer that we are more familiar with. They were a tribal society and probably did not possess a single monarch. They lived primarily in Cyrodil and formed an empire there based partly around the enslavement of the Nords and the proto-Human inhabitants of Cyrodil. They were overthrown by their slaves and their civilization was gradually wiped out in Cyrodil. Many or most fled to Valenwood or even Summerset Isle and were integrated among the Bosmer and Altmer, but some were rumored to remain, hiding in seclusion among the wild places of Cyrodil.

Discovering Ayleid remnants in the wilds in ESO seems far more likely to me than finding living Dwemer (with the possible exception of our friend [Yagrum Bagarn](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Yagrum_Bagarn)).

So I'll use EVE as my example. Dying in EVE sucks. Firstly, you die and are cloned back, losing stat implants and possibly skills if you haven't upgraded your clone recently. This leads to interesting situations with pirates who sometimes hold people hostage for money or blow them up for the loot in their hull.

I don't personally feel a system quite like that truly fits in a hero based game but I do feel getting killed should carry loss. And really a repair bill and spawn wait just doesn't make you care, if you died you had to go find your body or your lose all the gear on it. So you could allow people to drag your body for you to help you out.  And this was a danger, when I was new I had some nice gear a guy gave me and died, some dude whispered me to help. 

He dragged my body deep into the woods and I never found it. I totally got scammed

What do you want from TESO?

 I'm interested to see what the general MMO community is interested in mainly ( that includes anyone now interested in this game [ one of us... one of...us]). After all this trinity talk it's made me wonder if people want a new game or a reskin of WoW (or something all too similar)? 

Speculation:

Sorry to put it so bluntly, but it needs to be said. You are not, those of you whose experiences are limited to that game and similar implementations are heavily limited by the MMO world that has now surrounded you by Blizzard's game and successful business model. Many games have imitated WoW and that makes loads of people believe this is the only way to do an MMO properly. Yet what many of you forget is that this a business, and the people following that trend only do so to make a quick buck. So as we can all see, the market has been flooded with these clones. Do you really want another game with a threat system where one person holds every mobs attention while they conveniently ignore the dps/heals? We all know the trinity works, but that's my case with this question. It's been done, and perfected,  why do you want the same game?? 

P.S. After extra thought, WoW cannot keep up with your consumption rate, if that's the case I don't think anyone will succeed and you probably need a break because you fail to realize the behemoth of all mmos cannot keep up with your addiction. (Remember guys! MMOs **are** addicitive and you have to remember why you're playing, is it for fun? Or are you trying to escape? If it's the latter you'll never find fulfillment in an mmo because it will never be able to supply you a real dynamic experience your soul yearns for. So go outside, fuck some shit up. Source: 13 years mmo experience) If this sounds like you, go ask Blizzard. 

Let other people have their game with new experiences and gameplay! If you want a better written WoW, you guys are douche bags.

Edit:

**TL;DR for the P.S.: Stop pushing developers to give you what Blizzard won't. Keep feeding Blizzard your money and gain support on their forums. We all realize it's easy to flood in and manipulate perceptions of what a new community wants on new MMOs. You should realize you're addicted and probably will never get what you want out of an mmo again, it's THE ELDER SCROLLS *ONLINE***

* Some of the plants around the game are used for ingredients but how are they going to work in the mmo? Will they still only respawn after a couple days or will they have an infinite amount of uses and never need to respawn?

**NPCs**

* My favorite part of the game is that in most cases, or will it be like most mmos?

**Combat**

* Will other players be able to walk up to an enemy I'm attacking and steal my experience? In situtations like this will experience be divided equally or only to a certain person?

The term combat queuing really means lining up attacks. Just like in a real queue(not to be confused with Qué or Cue) people wait in line for their turn at whatever they want to do. So in a game

Pros: This will allow for some interesting macros. From some alpha testing

Cons: So far, but suddenly the enemy is out of range and your fiery reach fails. Now you are forced to execute the other two moves, expending stamina/magicka and you accomplished nothing. 

**Questions/Topics**

* What experience do you have with macros in MMOs?

* Do you think combat queuing should even be in ESO? Would a truly live combat system flow better?

There may even be certain abilities available to specific classes that will put you in sneak if you choose to evolve the ability that way.

Zenimax can utilize this and take advantage of it.They  can create phases with people that want to be able to battle other people in other zones(world pvp/ganking) and other phases with people that do not and just want questing. People can check out the zone and not have to deal with the world pvp. And the other side can have hours of fun with ganking people or keeping a small village like in other games. One simple solution 2 issues. It can bypass flagging for pvp completely. With some regulations on phase switching and some simple game ideas as city guards and stuff.  This could work and open the game up to not have faction locked zones. So people can experience the full game and have the immersion that is needed. Even the questing does not need to be unlocked in an enemies area just to be able to check out the scenery and it can give the feel of ""scouting"" or ""Invasion"" on an enemy factions territory for the pvp phase so to speak which is logical in a war when 2 sides are battling and i do not think it conflicts with the lore at all",t5_2tqi0,True

- I'm looking into the Live Preview issues that are display a live background

- The big ""momma"" - RES.key-navelement. This is the stupid white background you see when you click on a comment and it basically blinds you. I have been trying to figure this out for months, please don't hesitate to send me a PM with the code correction!

- The notorious ""Light Theme"". So, I haven't really worked on it, mainly because since then I've gotten a full-time job as a UI designer. However, this isn't an excuse for me to cut the cord on something for the community. If anyone would like to help out with a light theme, or provide resources, or insight, please contact me via private message

ESO will feature a system that will crown the MVP of the winning faction as Emperor. We have heard that a single campaign could take *months*, so the more you participate, the more points you earn.

Being emperor will bring bonuses to your Alliance. They have been pretty vague about the details

**Questions/Topics**

* Do you like the idea of a player emperor?

* Can you imagine a scenario where one guy(or guild) is emperor indefinitely? 

* Do you think healers will have a chance at becoming emperor?

* What bonuses do you think being emperor should give you(if you are emperor)?

* What bonuses should the winning alliance gain? Should they be limited to Cyrodiil and PvP?

1363975769.0,1at908,Doing End-Game Right - how TESO should change,artie290,18,11,55,"I have been an MMORPG/TES player for the last 12 years

I was not surprised to hear that there are not going to be large raid content for launch. It was hinted earlier when they described healing spells as only cone and aoe. It is hard to design raid content when you can't single heal your tank. ZOS has major flaws within the current design of the game, but because it will reduce the overall population of the game. I know my friends are hardcore raiders will not even get this game because of that.


**The Solution**

**option 1 (not likely or preferred) Release game as currently designed with a B2P model with a shop similar to GW2. While this is not my preferred solution


This option will make them enough money to recoup most of the costs of development. This is unlikely to happen due to the business model ZOS had in mind when they started this project. It is also unlikely due to developers desire to create additional content post launch in a non expansion format. I can offer no proof of this, the years this game has been in development, their marketing expenses for the game and the collected information to date make this educated guess.


**2.(likely and preferred) ZOS will launch TESO with an online subscription model costing anywhere between $12-16 USD per month with 30 days free when you first buy the game. Furthermore they will most likely offer beta access to pre-orders much the same way that GW2 did.**

In order for this game to be successful as subscription based. They have to cater to EVERYONE. This of course puts TESO in direct competition with the most successful MMO of all time World of Warcraft. This means that TESO will need to introduce the following content post launch.

a) PVP Arenas (lore friendly)

b) Structured PVP (can be lore friendly faction v faction pve objective based)

c) Raiding (lore friendly

It will be difficult but possible for ZOS to change TESO enough to support these systems. I believe WOW does all of these things fairly well, pvp, spvp, apvp and rvr pvp albeit at a much slower pace to reward the raiders for their ability to play well in a group and defeat functional, fun and challenging raid content. I realize the loot drops are not lore friendly but I just don't see how anyone can find it unfair.

I was going to include #3 postpone the game

I would also wish that people would be more tolerant of each other. Threads saying x should be a priority over y are insulting and not helpful. To succeed this game is going to need to cator to both x and y

What are your thoughts?

Edit 1: in an interview with Zam on March 22 game director Matt Frior stated there will be no adventure zones or raids at launch. The focus will be on getting existing systems up to date and launching a good core gaming and building from there. He did say that they are experimenting with Adventure Zones and that he didn't want to say too much as it may change. I am sad to hear this but at least elated to think that Adventure Zones are being seen as a priority post launch.

1358395552.0,16qd2q,Spellmaking? My take. ,sapo444,12,3,7,"I know that this is a topic thats being thrown around and I wanted to give my 2 cense

First off

LOL has little balance and the players themselves develop new strategies to counter each others strategies. 
Chess on the other hand

Now that thats squared away
As we know, and Lightning spells. Restoration has Healing, Wards, and Turning undead spells. And So on and so on. Imagine if you will, a system where you start with no spells and instead have to create your own from these sub categories. Take 2 Fires, and maybe some components, and make a basic fire spell. Then mix and match the spells with other spells to make more and more. Sounds unbalanced right? Well I have a few ways to help make it Perfectly Imbalanced. 

First
Next a proficiency system. Lets say we have two lvl 5 players, so the mana to cast might be 7, and manage may be 12. The more proficient you are with a spell, the more DMG and less mana will be needed to cast. 
Finally, players can stand a chance against each other. Someone got a healing ward? Use a new type of exploding thrall or lightning/fire spell. By making some op and some underpowered spells, you can create our word of the day, Perfect Imbalance. 

Now for a fun thought I had: A spell market
Players could write the newly created spells down of scrolls for others to buy. You could make a market on scrolls for any type of situation. Now, so to speak. most players can just buy the new spells and learn them permanently. The market could dry up once everyone knows all the spells. Besides, the point if this spell making is to make your own spells, not buy them from others permanently. scrolls can be useful, one time only things. ( and keeps the market alive, and gold in your pockets )

This concept can make the RvR battlefield more dynamic. Imagine different types of spells flying across the battlefield. Mages would be at an arms race to make and perfect new spells to use. Scrolls for knights would sell like sweet rolls. 

Thats my 2 cense. Thank you

Much of the game was scripted to stand still until you progressed the story, but so much was not - to the point that I often wonder how many personal adventures I may miss out on by using the fast travel option as opposed to hoofing it. It was so obvious to me that this was integral to Skyrim's success that I thought ""well, obviously that same ecosystem would be part of any attempt to convert TES to an MMO."" To me, this is what would set TESO apart from the stale theme parks that saturate the market. Obviously this would be more complicated to capture in an MMO - or would it? If the ecosystem is defined by its interaction being independant of player activity, then shouldn't it be more attainable, not less?

Following the recent flare-up

That being said,** the obvious flaws in this system seen in the leaked video are insanely alarming to me. For a game based on immersion in a seamless world, the seemingly lackluster mechanics behind hit registration is insanely alarming to me. These are things that need to be addressed by the developers for this game to have a chance at success. Graphics can and will change, but if the simplest mechanics of the game do not function properly, then the game will ultimately fail. This is supposed to be an action MMO, every swing, spell cast, and equally so when said attack connects with a target or the player himself. I have been extremely eager to see Zenimax incorporate the concept of fluid real-time combat into this title. After watching the leaked video, check out Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.)

For those of you who agree with me and would like to see some of these changes to the combat system before release, (I'm sorry but I really do think so!) **imagine trying to accurately time hits and blocks against a real live person in  end-game PvP with this currently shown system.** (or any PvP for that matter) In my opinion this needs to be addressed for the game to be ultimately successful. Keep drawing attention to this and we can hope (unfortunately maybe fruitlessly) that this will be addressed by the developers in the coming months prior to release.

One possible solution to this problem without drastically changing game mechanics could be to reduce the range of attack. I want to know that I am hitting what I am trying to hit because my weapon passes through them and there is accurate hit registration

This seems very like the Guild Wars 1 system in which certain mobs had and actively used abilities that were obtainable by the player. Most of the time using an item on the corpse of these enemies allowed the player to obtain one of the skills used and it was a key part in creating character builds.

ESO seems to have taken it one step further and will have enemies using player abilities in combos just as a player group would do. This seems every exciting

I would love to have abilities picked up on the defeat of certain bosses and enemies. Although I hate artificial gating of content(e.g. attunements from previous raid needed for next) I think requiring at least a few members of a raid to have an ability from a dungeon boss in order to beat the encounter(e.g. A freeze/tranquiliser to use on berserking adds) would make the game feel more dynamic and would help different fights feel different not just though different mechanics but because you have to use different abilities in order to complete them.",self,t5_2tqi0,1359589455.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/17lb6q/an_interesting_quote_from_the_guardian_article/

I really think this is important so I sent them a long mail with my thoughts:

I'm going to try to answer a slightly different question: Why are the Elder Scrolls games so much more immersive than generic MMORPGs?

Lets start at Morrowind. First of all you have a big, like when reading a good book you got sucked in, thanks to the well written quests and dialogue. Finally the fact that you can solve quests in different ways, and have to figure out the best solution yourself, and then see the consequences of your actions affect the game world is what I think makes the game so immersive. In a typical MMO on the other hand, you will go from zone to zone, doing the same things over and over. Even if the quests are well written and voice-acted

Moving on to Oblivion, there must be reasons why the monsters are there, and they should at least have some non-combat behavior.

Playing Skyrim, and in Skyrim there were plenty of them. It's hard to define exactly, but the attention to detail that went into making the environments of Skyrim is very clear.

Immersion is definitely one of the most important aspects when it comes to any role-playing game, or contradictions in the story and lore. If you met some author when playing Morrowind, you shouldn't find his books lying around in the second era when playing ESO.",,False,self,t5_2tqi0,,http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1gqpsk/developer_question_of_the_week_27/

However

To all you who are genuinely looking forward to this game you need to stop feeding these knuckle heads.

1) Anyone who looks at a very early unoptimized beta leak and draws any conclusions good or bad is jumping the gun.

2) Short of the player trolling the mechanics looked fluid and dynamic despite a non-melee class pick and starting off at level 1.

3) The world looked massive.  Just utterly huge.  Not since EQ1 have I scene an MMO world that was just like wow this really is a Massive MORPG.

4) It looked very very Elder Scrolls.  (News flash you don't kill elder dragons at level 1 in Skyrim so quit hating on the mudcrabs)  Even to the detail of scropions crawling around on pipes.  No other MMO has yet to add this level of fine detail.

5) Just running around and exploring was possible.

Some questions to get the discussion going:

- what armor type will you use (light/medium/heavy)

- what secondary skills will you use to give your healer more flavor? (are you going to be sneaky? use a shield and mace? use a bow? use offensive magic?)

- do you think main healers will be required to focus only on health + magika? what sort of breakdown will that look like? do you think there will be a lot of pressure for healers to invest an uncomfortable amount into magika relative to health in order to be competitive?

At this point I am leaning towards light armor and making the character more ""sneaky"" with maybe a bow to help out with damage dealing.",self,t5_2tqi0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1agynf/healer_build_types_general_discussion/

In WoW PVPer's would earn credits which they could use to buy powerful sets of armor, and minor character enhancements (Example; A Druid in full PVP gear would possess a higher movement speed while shapeshifted.) this was a great format at first glance because you felt your character become more powerful with each set piece you acquired. The con's were that you were so much more powerful than a new PVPer it was almost unfair, and relatively discouraged newer players from PVP.

Now I'm less familiar with GW2's PVP system, in that it allows you to show off your skill/time spent. Though I suppose the con's would be that it doesn't feel like much of a reward, makes you a potential target, and when you are ganged up on, you don't have any stat boosts to help you put those noobs in their place.

If you're still reading, so what could we take from WoW? The character enhancements! Having an armor set that doesn't give you major stat boosts will keep things competitive, but those minor enhancements can potentially give you an edge once the tables begin to turn. Also, you can show off your spiffy new duds so everybody knows your a badass.

""But nthm94, allow me to propose two more ideas: An armor perk system! Once you earn a complete new set you may choose from a variety of character enhancements. This would work kinda similar to enchanting from ESO I suppose, in that you would be given the choice of things such as buffs to weapon skills, armor skills, mobility, CC time, stealth, etc.

Now my second idea to counter enhancements being useless for some people is simply grant enhancements and bonuses to your classes skills. The ones that you are granted based on the class you choose

TLDR: You really should read it, and character enhancements from WoW, handled similarly to enchanting from Elder Scrolls.",,False,self,t5_2tqi0,,http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/18g7mv/pvp_idea_a_new_approach_to_keep_things/

So you will have 10 spell augments, or increase the damage by 2 (these are all relative of course). These can also change

**tl;dr:** Two types of level ups for spells

**edit:** Like all skill trees is multiplayer games

**late night edit:** This type of progression could also reduce the number of base spells necessary for a good game. Ex: One fireball, one could be direct damage, the other AoE, and the other a fast cast. This could even work with areas like Illusion and Restoration.

Imagine if the only way to change factions was a challenging questline that would involve going through multiple dungeons and zones

Something like this would allow players to change factions, would appreciate the effort they had put in to changing factions.

The only problem it would not solve, preventing them from doing so. Personally, I don't see this as a big issue - at least it wasn't in wow, which I admit is the only other faction based mmo I've played for any large amount of time. Friends either end up rolling alts of different factions to play with each other, or give up on their original race choice for their main and go with one with which that they can interact with their friends.

Unfortunately, which is the simplest choice. Still, what do people think about this idea?

Other activities that could benefit from their own skill tree:

**What is wrong with MMORPGS**
*Massive Multiplayer Online* The game is a social network. You are meant to work with others, etc. There isn't much of that in MMORPGS anymore. On the surface it may appear that there is, Wow has 10 and 25 man raids, battle grounds, etc. But why are people working together? For themselves. They want honor, they want X piece of gear. If they could do it by themselves many would. Sure there are guilds, but what do guilds do together? Run raids so everyone can get his or her own piece of gear? Group dynamics doesn't really matter in games like Wow. Look at battlegrounds. Very little strategy

*Role Playing*- This one is a big subject for me. RP is dead in MMORPGS. Your race doesn't really matter in many games beyond some stats. Your class determines your playstyle but no one cares beyond what type of dps, mobs, battlegrounds. No one cares who you are, only what you can offer (goes back to the MMORPG side). Even on RP servers all there really is a few RP chats going on here and there. You are still just a statistic to other players and you can only join the raid if your stats/gear matches up to what they want. 

*Game*- Seriously guys just have fun don't treat it like a job.

**What I want to see**

I want to see people mattering. We are all sitting behind a screen playing a game, dont be a level 100 smith, 1 handed, destruction, two handed, block, etc etc etc running around shouting that you have 5 steel plates for sale. 
Dont just think about yourself. Honestly I would rather spend my time (and I hope you would too) having fun then using my time ""efficiently"" like I said this isn't a job. Who cares if you are saving up 100000 billion old for a slightly different looking axe, etc.

I can appreciate the drive toward giving players more freedom in the way they play their classes, take, and give damage it really makes much less difference what's going on with the other members of the group.

On the other hand, DCUO) and play a more balanced character when solo but switch to a build that min/maxes your ability to do your role in the group.

**Real Arrows and Real Archery**

The archery system in Skyrim was simple enough that one could reliably kill enemies from medium range with little to no skill, and to understand how they would fly.  Making this the archery system for TESO wouldn’t stop new players from picking up archery and enjoying it, but it would make talented archers prized and sought after in PvP guilds, and would make room for tactics involving ambushes and assassinations. It would give a commander pause as his army approached a canyon pass that leads right to the enemy keep, and perhaps encourage him to take the longer, safer route.

**Lots of Spells**

TES lore is rife with examples of generals using mages in creative ways to overcome their enemies. [Prince Juliek]( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/2920, or water-breathing and swift swimming instead so that he can take the river past the enemy entirely and attack their stronghold? As the walls begin to crumble at a fort do the defenders call for Frost Atronachs to slow the enemies charge as archers and mages destroy them from afar, or Dremora to join the warriors in bloody battle? Allowing this range of “flavor” spells will reward organized groups and help them distinguish themselves from the bands of pick-up-group marauders they’re sure to encounter.

**Truly Customizable Characters**

Zenimax has been talking a lot about how their character development will allow for varied characters, then combine them with proficiency in heavy armor and maces to become a specialist in crumpling hard targets. This diversity also helps with balance issues as it shift the focus from “Class X has no counters to Class Y” to “Spell A and Spell B are just too powerful when used in conjunction.” The ultimate boon, however, is the satisfaction felt by players when creating new strategies.

**Unified Command Chat**

Organization of the zerg, so that they can strategize, and another channel for talking to the entire faction. While everyone should be able to read this command channel, only a few should be able to use it. The method of determining who these people are could vary. They could be the Guild Leaders of the top PvP guilds or people who have spent a lot of time leading PvP groups. Perhaps both. It is an important feature that allows a faction to work in a smoother manner.

**Routs**

There must be situations in which one army is totally bested by the other through super numbers and arms. No artificial barriers should be put in place to enhance fairness. Though it may seem unfair to allow ten defenders to fight against one hundred attackers, or use the environment to his advantage, then he has outplayed his enemies, and they would do well to learn for him. This is not to say that truly unbalanced features should be left in, but one must examine if a feature is unbalanced, or if the wrong counter is being applied.
