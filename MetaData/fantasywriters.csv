1362960860.0,1a1v1n,I met with an agent who had read the first 40 pages of my novel yesterday.,Kaladin_Stormblessed,87,5,42,"I attended a writing conference this past weekend.  It wasn't specifically fantasy-centric, and sat back to wait.

This is the first time a professional has looked at my writing (I haven't tried sending query letters since my first stab at this 8 years ago).  I was *extremely* nervous.  Apparently I didn't need to be.  She absolutely loved my first three chapters

She did give me some critiques, she wanted me to send her the whole novel.  And she made me promise not to query anyone else.

This... is unbelievable.  It feels like a dream.  I realize that it's only the very first step (it's entirely possible that when she reads the whole thing she'll decide it's not for her), etc), and am hoping to have all that ironed out in the next few weeks so I can send her the complete manuscript and get her thoughts on it.

Originally I had planned this to be a five-book series in which each book could feasibly stand alone (sort of like Dresden Files), but a trilogy was definitely do-able. Thankfully this is easily remedied as I didn't have much in the way of outlines for books 3-5, so I can cut #4 and roll 3 &amp; 5 into one.  So if you're a debut author and thinking about querying, that's something to keep in mind.

I also asked her whether we might face marketing issues given that my protagonists are bi and gay.  She said that it was possible that some publishers might worry that they wouldn't be able to market it and *might* ask me to change one of the main characters into a woman instead, even if it meant losing out on a potential book deal.

But that, I'm ecstatic that someone ""in the industry"" (who has sold books to TOR... **TOR!**) liked my writing enough to request the whole book.  It gives me hope for my writing.  Hope that I might actually make this dream into a reality.

And you guys were a huge part of this.  Your critiques

I had other people read it and said it was decent but I started to fall into the ""it's not good enough syndrome."" I finally abandoned the project

Fast forward to me at 20 years old. I enrolled in a Storytelling class and the guy that taught it was this hilarious ol' Brit who (apparently) was part of their Secret Service and was the military adviser for the movie 'Aliens'. 

I don't know how we got on topic but one day he asks everyone 'who in here has written a completed novel?' Without thinking I sheepishly raise my hand. He smirked and asked me how many pages. I told him and then he proceeded to ask another 20 questions. Finally (in front of everyone mind you)

I can't begin to tell you the anxiety I felt that someone else (besides my close friends

The day he returned my manuscript is the day I really can't stop thinking. I walked up to his podium and this guy just looked at me straight in the eye still holding on to my binders. I felt awkward 'cause he wouldn't let go. He said, like he was afraid I wouldn't actually listen to him.

I am 26 today and that same manuscript sits on my desktop. I don't know why this matters or why I'm posting. I guess these past months my story just won't get out of my head and writing this will actually give me the courage to look at it again.

This book has spelling errors, lists of adjectives when he's describing something, then there's boring and vague descriptions like ""he had beautiful eyes"" and then it moves on. At one point, he even switched the name of a main character! I guess the search-and-replace feature on Word missed it. There's an unlikable narrator voice who is just throwing out unnecessary foul language and odd references that don't flow: ""she thought Edward Cullen was sexy"" or ""her dad went to the titty bar"" or ""he reminded her of an elf from Lord of the Rings"" or ""her dad thought Obama was a nigger."" I'm not kidding you! And it literally has nothing to do with the story! Then there are slews of too fanciful words that he must have gotten from the thesaurus, a plot that is going absolutely nowhere, characters that are full of themselves or just plain stupid tropes. There's an over-usage of the same words, dry dialog that feels more like a lecture of backstory than actual communication... The list could go on. I feel like this is a joke. Like is this for real?

But what constitutes a setting? Most people answer with ‘the time and place a story takes place in’. So one answer could be Victorian Paris. Another could be in an arm of a distant galaxy. But the place isn’t the only thing that creates the setting. The general populace creates it too

Which is the problem

What is your central conflict?

Ask yourself that every time you start a scene. The central conflict IS the hatred between the insectoid Klicklaks and the hated avian Flutters? Then how does that play out? If your piece sounds like a history lesson given by Ben Stein, and for that action to mean something, it must be opposed (Newton’s laws are even applicable to writing! Who knew!). Who is the opposing force? Ideas are not opposing forces! Ideas create the opposing forces, getting into the minds and guiding the actions of the antagonists. Your character may hate the concept of wanton abuse of natural resources, but without someone to struggle against, what makes him any different than a blogger sitting on a recliner sipping tea while they type out a scathing rebuke on their iPad? And that rebuke is nothing more than setting- creating the environment in which the conflict exists (Here is the situation, and here is the counter argument against it). It’s this small difference that causes confusion

Be aware of your characters, it’s story. If it’s the reason behind the situation that prompts the action, it’s setting. Keep your work focused on story. While actions require setting to have meaning, setting itself is not the story.

1362396794.0,19mteh,Share your rules of Magic!,BluApples,22,2,52,"*Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.*  

I've just finished another seven pages of my first draft and am ready for some fun! I thought I'd put out my rules of magic for ""Fighter, to see what you all thought, and to find out more about the rules magic follows in your stories.  

In ""Fighter, magic and science have progressed together, to the point that magic itself is a branch of scientific study. It is dangerous and tricky to do, but in theory anyone can learn how to do magic if they have the inclination and the patience to study it. Of course, some people are more ""apt"", and they tend to become the most powerful mages.  

Magic in the world of Jord involves four acts of will: The Sacrifice

The complexity of the spell is kind of fluid

1. **Cantrips** are direct acts of magic with immediate effect. They draw their energies directly from the environment, the caster must judge the amount of energy required for the act and send it forth. The deed for starting a fire might simple be snapping one's fingers, and the word should not be something in the common language the caster speaks. Of course, the thought should be a clear image of the intended effect.  

2. **Charms** are wrought within a circle of power containment. Charms are basically cantrips that are bound in an object, the energies are contained and placid. But once the circle is broken, the spell will attempt to manifest. If the object of the charm is not strong enough to contain the cantrip, it can burst. Depending on the cantrip, this can be a minor annoyance or a complete disaster. Charms, as opposed to enchantments, are one time use only. They don't require direct sacrifice from the caster, a crucible of boiling fat).  

3. **Workings**, up to and including a murder of an innocent being. Staffs and wands usually form a part of the working, because the breaking of the circle casts the spell, and the energies involved can be very devastating. To begin a working, a cantrip may be used to destroy the sacrifice. An ""annihilate"" cantrip can reduce the matter of the sacrife to pure energy to charge the circle. breaking the circle at the wrong time, or having a circle that isn't strong enough to contain the energies of the cantip, can... be bad.  

4. **Enchantments** are like charms, but the plus side is that multiple workings can be woven into an enchanted item. Enchanting an item requires patience, craftsmanship, and and enormous amount of focus. They can take months to prepare, and since nothing can cross the circle, all food that the enchanter requires, as well as his or her (um) effluence

5. **Weavings** are great spells that only Sylphan sorcerers and Gods can create. They draw upon the universe itself as their sacrifice. The last weaving on Jord was 700 years ago

So where do we go

Here are the possibilities

* ""Thank you for your thoughts. Here's what I was trying for {blah blah blah}. Guess it didn't work for you.""

At root

So what do we do once we get that criticism?

1. First

1. Second, even if they didn't entirely get it.

1. Third, etc.). But more often, because of where the reader is sitting, the change makes sense from their perspective. What would the effect be if the suggested change was applied? This is definitively **not** to say that all criticism should be taken. But in my experience, it's important not to reject criticism out of hand. 

1. Finally:

  * If the criticism is judged useful, not a communal effort. Whatever we decide will make the piece better, it needs to come through in our own voice, telling our own story.

  * Or, from the above, I'd argue 'no'. Make the change or don't make the change; the critter's life will sail along just as merrily regardless.

I contacted him and asked if he were open to taking commissions

I provided a description of the character and a couple of reference pictures.  This was the description I gave:

&gt; Suken Anisaria, green eyes, short sandy brown hair and usually clean-shaven. He’s doesn’t much care about cleanliness (which leads to him getting the nickname “Dusty”). Very lithe – he does a lot of running around on rooftops, not much good in a fist-fight. Weapon of choice is a small repeating crossbow which he usually hangs from a hook on his belt when he’s not using it. His defining feature is his hat, which he is rarely without and usually wears low enough to hide his eyes. He lives in a very rainy climate so he wears a thin leather poncho most of the time over his clothes. As for the clothes themselves… no idea, really. Feel free to do whatever you like in that regard. One of the things I like most about him is that he is very religious/superstitious. He has a bag of thin golden coins inscribed with a set of symbols which he’ll flip to ask his goddess for guidance (sort of like flipping a heads/tails thing)… then he’ll toss the coin to “the winds” to thank her. Personality: I think the best way to describe him is charmingly arrogant. He thinks the world of himself but in an “I can do no wrong” sort of way as opposed to an “I’m better than everyone else” way. He loves his job most of the time, and when he doesn’t

The artist confirmed that he would definitely be interested in the piece

He sent me four thumbnail sketches of various poses and asked me to choose one.  A few days later he sent along a line-art sketch

He sent a final image with grey-tones and asked if there were anything else I had issues with.  I didn't

[Here's the final product.](http://imgur.com/bIkej)

I specified that it would be fine for him to use on his DeviantArt or main website if he wanted to

I'll likely be using this as marketing material when I finish the book

[**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**]

Abercrombie defies most conventional fantasy tropes in his work which can be refreshing but also sort of frustrating as he almost does it to a fault where *nothing* will be as it seems and almost every character ends on an inconclusive note. His story is realistic to the point that at the end it felt like nothing was really changed or gained and there were several loose ends and a lack of closure for a lot of the subplots. It might have just been me but I don't think he even fully explained everything completely. It left me feeling like a lot of the novel wasn't needed for such a weakly coherent ending.

Generally reviews I have read online have been quite positive reveling in the fact that it was ""original fantasy"" but I can't help but think the ending was mundanely weak.

Anyways even if you haven't read the First Law trilogy I would love to hear your guys' take on fantasy endings and how they should be handled after a reader puts in a lot of time and emotion into a novel (not so much happy vs. sad endings just more what makes an ending successful).

I recently released my [first novel](http://www.amazon.com/The-Reintegrators-ebook/dp/B00DD0UQCG) on Kindle and in paperback. Some of you probably saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1gskj1/i_uploaded_my_first_novel_to_amazon_a_week_ago/) I made earlier detailing how it came about. If so and you're sick of hearing about me then I apologize.

I also apologize for steering the conversation in this sub away from craft stuff and toward the marketing side of things. The reasons I'm posting here are A) you're all generally a very helpful bunch of people B) /r/selfpublish is sort of dead C) I have seen cases where writers in this sub have been successful selling books (and it doesn't take much to qualify as a success in my mind) D) There's a lot of marketing advice out there which isn't necessarily focused on fantasy

So, and things to do assuming I can get reviews (and assuming people actually like the book):

**Phase 1: No Reviews**

- Tweet

- Ask friends/family to spread word.

- Add book to Goodreads lists.

- Add info to Shelfari (see http://musingsonminutiae.com/articles/promoting-marketing-shelfari/).

- I'll be the /r/Fantasy FAOTD in mid-July

- Message users on Goodreads and Amazon and ask for a review in exchange for a free copy. See http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1aqkjq/dos_and_donts_or_getting_reviews_for_your_book/. The part of this I'm dreading will be figuring out books similar to mine. I've always been bad at this.

- Possibly: Goodreads book giveaway. Not sure if Goodreads users will participate unless they know the book is good already. Also not sure how to let people know the giveaway is happening (does Goodreads notify people automatically?). Then again

- I'll be ordering a half-dozen paperbacks to bring with me to Worldcon in late August. I also might get some cards printed with a QR code that will bring people to a free review copy of the e-book.

**Phase 2: Things to consider if I get good reviews**

- Paid listing sites like Goodkindles

- Free KDP Select days

- Low price promotions e.g. http://www.pixelofink.com/ or http://www.bookbub.com/advertise/ (expensive but may be worth it).

- Paid Ads: Google Adwords

- Submitting to review blogs.

**Things I'm aware of but not hot on**

- Blog tour. Not sure I'm a fan of these

- Free short story set in the story's world. Unfortunately, I've never had any luck getting Amazon to price match things.

So, please let me know. And if I start questioning you, please don't take it as me being ungrateful/a dick. It's just that I'm trying to find activities that maximize the bang I get for my time; that way I can spend more time writing.

Part of the reason for eFiction's success is that the magazine is run in an inclusive rather than exclusive fashion. Most magazines have editors/staff that exist in an ivory tower that is inaccecible to readers and writers. eFiction is the exact opposite. It is a thriving writing community that also happens to create a monthly magazine. Editors, and artists mingle together to produce the issues.

eFiction Fantasy will be created in much the same way. So we've got a gated fantasy workshop, and a fantasy publication to promote and compensate the writers who participate. It is a functioning business that anyone can volunteer to ""work"" for (if you can call this work). 

So we're accepting short story submissions for our inaugural issue. I will be tapping into my existing audience for promotion

Compensation will be based on a % of the first paycheck I receive from Amazon. 50% goes to the managing editor of the issue and the rest will be split fairly among the contributors. Again

Now, why is this good different from this man's good, and so and so forth. But I want to look at three questions: What is good? What is evil? What is their place in our society, specifically, our fiction?

So, Hercules, pretty much every action movie guy, etc). We like them to have something to overcome. What does Superman have to overcome when he can literally bench press two planets?

But that is neither here nor there. Some people say that Superman is too good. He's a boyscout

So why the dislike of pure good? Is it because we don't see it in ourselves? Is it that we don't see the perfect law abiding and defending citizen, but one we could never hope to achieve? Perhaps. But perhaps not. There are many stories of people doing good deeds with no hope of reward and the only motivation being their good nature. You don't need me to link to these, you probably have a couple yourself, where either you or another was helped by someone's kindness. This, I posit, is goodness: helping others, advancing humanity, then it is good. This is not limited to others: you can perform a selfish

Perhaps we dislike Superman because he is the best of us, which is our next topic.

Evil, to some degree, because you are wounding a piece of humanity, and hindering us as a whole, even with the loss of just yourself. Imagine how many people who have committed suicide who might have revolutionized science with a few more years of thought, or saved someone else's life? This is why selfish actions often are evil, because by nature of a selfish action

There is certainly grey area to this: perhaps a hero harms himself in order to help others. This is self sacrifice and it is considered one of the greatest goods of our world. It is called valor by some

Now, have tried to make Supes relevant by making him morally ambiguous. This is certainly interesting, but I don't believe its true to Superman's character completely. He is an Ideal. He is an extreme, and we need that. We should have a character represent utter good in fiction. He won't grow, perhaps, but he is someone by which you measure all others in their goodness, and you can see how the develop and grow as characters BECAUSE we have an ideal of good, as it were. The same for evil. Someone should be the standard, our Nyarlothotep

But we prefer our main characters, to be ambiguous. We want our hero to struggle to overcome things, because we struggle to overcome things. We want to relate to our heroes. We want them to have tinges of evil in the good, to have selfish, conflicting emotions. And we want our villains to sometimes be... well, kind. Perhaps they have a soft spot in their hearts. It makes them human, and that's what we like stories of

Anyways

Insisting on applying a flaw to your character is the same as treating your character like one of those flat cardboard dolls with magnetic clothing where you can mix and match the outfits. And you don't want to make them look preppy so you give them a magnetic patch on their knee.

It's like those brand name designer jeans that have pre-ripped holes.

...

A character is a *person*. Think of people you know and consider how limited it is to qualify them based on a list of strengths and weaknesses. Better yet, z, good with people, but is easily stressed out under pressure, has aversion to SUVS because a pet was run over by one when I was a kid, and often I am bad at reading the subtext of what people are saying to me"" No. Not even close. 

If you are writing a character thinking that a few character flaws makes them interesting you have a problem, and tacking on a few hipster/grunge style accessories. 

So that's great, and doesn't know how to deal with small children, that doesn't make them a developed character, because it doesn't make them a person. And they are basically still a Mary Sue.

...

There's no easy fix for this. There's no recipe for having an interesting character

What you want to do is get in your character's head, and that's just not going to cut it.

The best approach to this might be writing your character into a bunch of different scenes. By this, but if you strip away the skills and stick them in a bar in NYC or California or the middle of the Sahara in 2013 they should still be pretty much the same person. Their core personality remains the same. They are still the person they are at the start of the novel, with whatever experiences, traumas, successes, and so on that they might have. 

And to truly know someone you need to know two things: how do they perceive themselves

So write a scene, but stands alone, is introspective. 

Now write that same scene from the perspective of someone else in the vicinity

...

That's one of many things you can do to get to know your character. It may not work for you, with conscious and subconscious floating around on many levels, while many different senses relay complex information that is interpreted in many ways. 

So if your current description of your character to yourself is a list of positive attributes and flaws, and *why* they are the way they are.

...

TL;DR: characters should not be defined by a few strengths and weakness

One minor reason that triggered my desire to write when I was younger was that I was sick and tired of unoriginal fan-fiction crap. Don't think I'm bashing all fan-fiction, or vampires in Forks, Washington and it got annoying very quickly. So I wrote original settings, characters, plots, etc.


I write fantasy because I find it much more fun and exhilarating than our normal world, myths, and bending the rules of what is ""normal."" I played video games and watched television shows or movies that fed my addiction. I wanted to submerge myself in their worlds, but couldn't. So I began writing my own stories.


I also began writing when I was younger to battle dyslexia. I didn't read much as a kid because I took too long and it was stressful to keep up with classmates or weekly journal assignments in English classes. Creative writing, it certainly has helped expand my vocabulary and knowledge of certain topics, since I actually enjoy doing research for my novel.


I actually started up a role-playing game on a ProBoards forum a while back, or family members would enjoy my writing. It was quite fun and successful, lasting a few years, but then my first year of college hit me and then there were 3 deaths in my family. Suffice to say, I closed down the site, and couldn't find the time, energy


Now, a steady job on campus. I feel like I can write again; the world has certainly given me fuel to add to my creative writing fire once again.


So yea... why do you write?

Keep in mind that the following is ""my personal opinion"" and not presented as ""gospel"" but some may find it helpful.

Reviews are a good way of establishing credibility of a work. In fact

**Venues to Concentrate on** 

I personally care most about Amazon and goodreads. Amazon because they are the 800 pound gorilla and goodreads because it is so easy to target people who should like the type of book you write. There’s not enough time in the day to “do it all” so the venues I neglect is Barnes and Noble  and the ibookstore. To be honest I don’t even know what my numbers are on those sites.
My series is published two different ways: self-published (6 book Oct 2007 – August 2011) and traditionally (3 books Nov 2011 – Jan 2012)  my numbers are:

* Amazon Traditional: 220
* Goodreads Ratings Traditional:2,531
* Goodreads Reviews Traditional: 406


**Paid Reviews**

I’m opposed to paid reviews.  There are a few reasons for this.

* The “good ones” are expensive (Kirkus $425 for standard

* No matter how much they claim to be “unbiased” readers it’s hard not to divorce from your mind that he who pays the piper gets to call the tune

* To me the reek of desperation

There was a book I was remotely interested in because of a “good review” by a site I wasn’t familiar with – so I clicked through and found out that it was a paid review site and it made me lose all interest in the book.  I just don’t think the risk of alienation is worth the small benefit to get one review.

**Review Trading**

From time to time a new writer will come up with what they think is a great idea…review trading. It sounds like the perfect synergistic relationship to help each other out but it’s a potential land mine and I really recommend not doing this. Consider the following:

What if the other person's book sucks?  Then what do you do? 

* You don't want to ""go on record"" singing praises and then look like a fool.

* What if they don't like your book and give you a bad review?  Do you give them a crappy review back?

* To give an ""honest"" review you have to read their book and that is time best spent writing other books
* What if they don't post a review?(Perhaps because they didn’t like it and didn’t want to say bad things) then you end up with nothing.
* If your book only has a few reviews
I’m all for supporting one another as writers. So if you read someone’s book and you like it…by all means review it.  They might notice and do the same for you

**Sock Puppets

It should go without saying that padding reviews with fake accounts or cajoling your friends and family to post reviews just isn’t a good idea.  I know when you are starting out the desire for reviews can drive you to do irrational things. But again, I really enjoyed this story and my comments are not based on my personal relationship with him.

It’s a very sad and disappointing fact that most of my family, my wife’s sister, and two of our three children. In fact in our entire “direct” family only one daughter has read the books (and they were written to get her to read!)  So I always find it interesting when people see a bunch of high reviews and write that it must be “all friends and family posting.” 

The point of a review is to provide credibility. As I mentioned before you have to avoid even the appearance of impropriety so you should never artificially pad reviews.

------------------

So now that I’ve told you what you can’t do…how do you get reviews. There are many ways to do this:

**Goodreads**

Is a perfect site because it is easy to find people that should be perfect fits for your books and as such will review the book well. You should:

* Find a book that is similar to yours
* Go on goodreads and find people with high ranked reviews for that book
* PM them that you have a book like that which you think they may enjoy and that you'll give them a free copy with no strings attached...your ""hope"" is that they will like it enough to post a review but you don't ""expect"" anything
* Reassure them that you want ""honesty"" (actually getting some positive and negative reviews is generally better than all positive reviews as people find it more ""credible""

**Amazon**

Some of the top reviewers on Amazon list their email addresses (or websites where you can find their addresses) so they are easy to reach. These  people are voracious readers and as such they provide some good credibility. For instance Harriet Klausner (#1 Amazon reviewer) is often used in marketing materials

**Bloggers**

I credit much of the success at getting the word out about my books to goodreads and bloggers. I actually [wrote a whole post on just how to “woo” reviewers so I’ll just repost it here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/sx440/how_to_get_book_bloggers_to_review_your_book/).

**Fans**

No one will speak more passionately about your books than a fan. They already love you and want nothing more than your success so why not help them help you.
Many fans post reviews, I’ll leave a review…I can’t believe I didn’t think of that myself,” they reply.

When I find a fan
* Thank them for their support
* Ask them if I can write back when I have a new book out (permission based marketing – a whole topic in and of itself)

However, and character descriptions, these threads would clog up its front page!

1356546800.0,15h7av,"It seems that it is the imperfect, not the perfect, character is the most likable. What sorts of flaws, short comings, and faults do you incorporate into your characters?",16,"I ask this because there seems to be a fine line between making a character too competent and dangerously stupid when giving them personality quirks and flaws. 

Make the flaws not very defining and you wind up creating a 'Mary Sue' who's short comings are so minuscule that if they weren't explicitly stated no one would know that they even existed. That or the flaw is present but isn't really a 'flaw' at all

An example would be Superman when he is written poorly. I know some  people out there swear by the Man of Steel, heat vision, ice breath, super strength and damned near invulnerable. His weakness? Kryptonite, and outside of that Superman's pretty much untouchable. He's stronger than you, faster than you, and just better than you. As a result for me he's hard to relate to and comes across as flat

However, however he is wrought with low-self esteem, self-hatred, doubt and some serious abandonment issues from his father who left him to go off and build giant cyborg-monster death machines. His dad calls him to come pilot one of the robots via blackmail and thus begins our hero's slow descent into insanity and depression as the stress of fighting horrible eldritch abominations wears on Shinji's mind. 

Now much like Superman, runs away from his responsibilities, and blatantly pines for for the approval of his father who by all accounts is a terrible human being. Yet most people do not like Shinji because he acts in ways people view as being 'wimpy' or like a 'pansy'. He is unlikable because his flaws seem to off set his perceived usefulness to the story.

So my question to /r/fantasywriters is how do you find the balance for your characters in terms of their faults and limitations? To me a truly interesting character is one who does have faults and flaws. Perfection is boring because there is no conflict with a perfect character. However

The first novel I wrote came in at 208, never cutting, never seeing fault. And she expanded, and her cheeks grew pudgy, and she waddled when she walked. That novel is shit.

My next two novels were a pair. Book 1 ""A Dream of Revenge"" and Book 2 ""A Debt of Revenge."" Their lengths: 104, running through a combined twenty drafts in the process. I deleted entire chapters, cut blocks of prose and dialogue, removed characters, changed endings and beginnings. If ever a story went through surgery and came out a different beast, it was these. I even, in a moment of recklessness, I feel, if it had been a child, they weren’t THE books. I was proud of them (I was proud of my first as an accomplishment). But I was capable of creating something far superior.

Thus

My current novel, and she’s talented, and all the people ooh and aah when they see her. And she was a bitch to create. I’ll keep with the child metaphor here. This novel is like one of those miracle babies, the kind that appear only after years of drugs, and doctors, and hours in the bedroom, and artificial insemination. This was not some accident spawned in the backseat of my parent’s car because I bought a condom that was one size too big. No, and intended, and I’d tuck her in at night. My adult voice came out at times

Her sister is still in training. Past the diapers stage

Honestly, one that only you can see and hear, and doing it so that others can see it as clearly as you can. I have no lack of thanks and appreciation for the countless writers who have inspired me and moved me to the point of creating my own books. I owe them something beyond precious.

------------

What is Show

The short answer is that neither is better; each has their use. But I believe they should be used knowingly and to a purpose. Loosely

* *Show:* Information is presented to the reader in a way that requires the reader to contribute their own knowledge and interpretation. Showing asks the reader to take an active role in understanding the story. It says ""here is a hole; you know enough to fill it in

* *Tell:* Information is provided to the reader with no engagement or analysis required.  Telling guides the reader to believe that they don't need to engage with whatever is being told; the storyteller will provide them everything they need to know about the thing. Typically this is accomplished by explaining rather than demonstrating.

Examples  (not great ones

&gt; Caroline looked at her keys and sighed. Her car was somewhere in the lot, pressed the Messages button to replay Jo's final call yet again. The last message Jo had left to anyone. Her voice had been so small and distant and scared. Caroline knew how she felt. 

versus

&gt; Caroline was profoundly depressed. It had been a horrible day


Telling isn't inherently bad; sometimes it's exactly what's needed. It's more compact, Telling is often the right way to go. (This can be used to mislead the reader as well.)  IMO, Telling is best used when the information being transmitted is more important than the audience's engagement. 

Another use for Telling might be when the author can't expect the reader to have a basis for interpretation. If the author's writing about a crystalline life form from another planet, for example, won't help. (It would breed mystery, though, which is always useful). Or, if the author is writing for an audience that isn't sophisticated enough to pick up nuance - e.g., primary-school readers

Too much of this, contributing ""their 50%."" By default, then, since I believe that we're best served by engaging the reader's attention and intellect the majority of the time, I believe that most of the time writers are best served soliciting the reader's participation, not spoon-feeding them information. Thus, in most cases

Again, mish-mosh-mashable. We can use Telling to Show, for example. We can blend Telling and Showing in the same paragraph - sometimes even in the same sentence. A fantastic narrative voice can get away with Tell all day long and then some, because the narrative voice is engaging the reader. But it's always useful to consider -- in revisions if not in first draft -- the impact we want a particular scene/exchange/paragraph/sentence/fragment to have on the reader, and use the tools accordingly.

(I think this, in that  they provide instructions for the reader on how to interpret what has gone before, and thus take the reader out of the experience.)

**How the Chutkra came to the Crimson Isle**

The greatest of the Chutkra was Chut, on the mainland.  Chut was the first to build in stone, and he dammed the mother river, forming the great lodge lake.  Chut boasted of his great feat, saying “I am master of the waters, there are none I cannot tame.”

Coyote, your great lodge lake is a puddle of piss.  The least cub could have created them.”  Chut replied “What an insult!  You mock my abilities, but I will prove them to you. Bring me to any water and I will tame it, and you will pass across without even dampening your paws.  

Coyote replied “Very well

“And if I succeed?” said Chut.

“If you manage to succeed

So Coyote took Chut and Kra to the ocean, and a storm arose.  Chut and Kra were swept out to sea on a pile of logs.  They floated for a day and a night until they washed up on the shore of the Crimson Isle.  Chut was in a foul mood, saying “I thought I was the greatest, but Coyote has bested me.  This vast sea is too powerful to be dammed.”  But Kra looked at the pile of logs, thought to herself, and said “Do not despair, for if Coyote cannot be defeated by strength

So Kra and Chut took the logs and joined them together tightly

“Coyote

“I do not see any dam” said Coyote

So Chut and Kra pushed Coyote across the water on the boat

“Our wager was that you would cross with dry paws

Coyote laughed, so you do not have to push your boat everywhere yourself.” 

 And so the first boat was invented, sometimes helping and sometimes hindering.  And Chut and Kra lived for a time on the Crimson Isle, where some of their descendents remain to this day.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/vee8o/critique_my_myth/

 In the Green times, the Goddess of the Harvest, filled their minds.  The people shed their goodness and grew petty. Safety and plenty had soured their souls leaving only room for greed and malice. Castiq cared only for the offerings and urged her followers in their bloody pursuits. The original people lost their strength in a time of gluttony and slaughter. Branglik watched this with sorrow in his heart. He had led these people to a land of wealth and it shamed him to see their actions.  Branglik flew to the Mount of Ush’allin and prostrated himself before his father. Mestish, the God of Storms, listened to his son and his anger grew. Lightning flared and thunder rumbled like a thousand thousand drums. He called his daughter Ashanna, who was the shepherdess of the sun. The fiery beast had been yoked to furnish the land of wealth.  Ashanna heard her brother’s story and wept bitter tears. She bade her brother to return to the Green lands and offer the original people one more chance of peace. Meshtish assented to this out of love for his gentle daughter.  Branglik returned to the people but they did not remember him. They had no mind for the power of the Wind and Storm in the Green lands.  Malice and hate clouded their every action.  Meshtish gathered his strength before descending on the Green lands. In a blaze of blinding fury he drove the vile Castiq into the Southern wilds. His rage carved the very earth and the clean water flowed away. Ashanna let loose her beast and the heavenly fire burned the lushness from the land. Branglik battered towns into dust and scoured the herds of the people.

One boy

When we dream

What if when you were asleep

Patrick O’Reilly is a 16-year-old boy living in Oregon, plays sports, and has a job.  In every way he is an average kid.  Except, of course, for his severe Social Anxiety and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Patrick O’Reilly is a 16-year-old boy living in Secant, sells whatever his family can spare in his village’s trading center, and visits the Fire every night to hear the nomads tell stories of their travels.  In every way he is an average kid. 

Earth is a land of technology and focus; where we are trapped by the limits of reality.  Custos is a land of wonder and freedom; where anything is possible.

Every night, and discovers spectacular impossibilities around every turn.  Every night, Custos Patrick dreams a life of simplicity, without the endless dragon attacks and the constant threat of death.

However, but from then on both boys are beginning to remember their dreams more and more clearly.

As each Patrick becomes more aware of the other

Both Patricks here begin their quest to find the door to finding themselves.  To finding the universe of their dreams.

Behind him Captain Rheo knew the city was glowing red. The fires had spread to the city walls. Nowhere was safe. They raced on, but the sky was not lit with the stars. It was thick with smoke that was not grey but painted in hues of orange and yellow. The air around them was thick with ash, which danced across their faces. He could hear the clatter of steel on steel and the screams of soldiers fading as they grew closer to the Great Door. Out of the swelling clouds a military skyship plummeted to the ground almost in silence. 


At the top of the Thousand Steps stood a Guardian Knight of the Thrince Order. He supported himself on his sword. The amour on his left side layered with blood


Rheo looked at the man and felt impatience swell in him. “Yield sir


Dyron whipped an arrow from his quiver and took aim


Orta stepped forward and grunted in disgust “A knight deserves a clean end. No witchcraft. I will take him to his god.”


“There is no time for your Knight’s code now. I need you with me. In the temple, pressing on into the temple.


As they stepped into the corridor they slowed their pace, held himself ready to fly at his enemy. Two double-bladed knives curved ferociously from his small hands. The hood of his robe swallowed his face in shadow. 


“Remember he is no ordinary child, but he has trained to fight like a wild thing.”


Captian Rheo felt an ache of sorrow for the child, Lieutenant.” 


“And we have our orders.” Orta said severely. 


The boy’s head twitched upward slightly


“I am not your enemy


The boy leaned back almost crouching. “You are in my path. You will step aside or fall like the others, the shadows fled and revealed black mounds covering  the floor. Rheo bowed his head in solemn sorrow as he realised they were the crumpled bodies of others trying to stop the boy and his kind.


 The boy whispered a blasphemy.


“Got quite the mouth on him.” Dyron spoke. Rheo heard the archer pull back the string of his bow.


The captain had become desperate to reach the boy that once was. “Do not shoot!” When he was within arm’s reach of the child he looked into the hood. A pale lilac reflection of light from his eyes stared back. “Come with us


Laughter came from all around them as if the boy were in the walls and floor and ceiling. The boy looked up and in one swift action pushed Rheo to the floor with inhuman strength. The captain’s hands were empty as they hit the floor


Orta was on him by the forth arrow, spinning the great man around in confusion and rage. Orta reached for the sprite, but the boy laughed again. Orta threw the great sword to the floor and unsheathed his bastard sword. The boy now on his shoulders, slipped his knives gracefully under the lieutenant shoulder guards and cut the straps of Orta’s breastplate. The child then dismounted, sliding down his back, using him as a shield against Dyron’s arrows. Orta clumsily stumbled backwards appearing to dodge the projectiles, spitting angrily at the sinewy archer as he cursed. 


“Kill it!” Orta screamed at Dyron.


Dyrons retort came through rapid arrow fire. “Move out of my way then


Having given up on trying to find his sword, matted curls. Across his back he wore only a belt of long and short blades and small leather pouches. Under the belt a large tattoo of the Thrince Order covered his skinny frame. His baggy fisherman-cloth shorts barely reached his ankles. The child twisted his body and flipped over himself to the wall’s edge, rounded a pillar and vanished into the darkness.


For a moment the three became as still as the stones around them. Quickening footsteps came from here and then there


Dyron saw him first


Rheo threw himself down hard


“Enough play.” The boy muttered staring into the captian’s eyes. The pouch released what seemed to be a liquid, tiny crystals plumed out into clouds and swirled through the air. The steel, unhindered took the lieutenant with it through a veil of sand and hit the floor with a screech. The boy was gone.


Orta crumpled to the floor and Rheo’s view out of the grand doorway was unhindered. The city was still glowing red. He tried to get to his feet
He looked up and out through the great doorway again. “Oh shit.”

It seemed that they had entered a shop. It was a large place that looked tiny only due to its large amount of contents. The mass amounts of tables and shelves were covered in everything from traditional herbs to strange vials filled with viscous fluids. The elf found himself eyeing a jar of eyes. He thought for a moment he saw one blink. He shivered.   
“Can I help you find anything,” he whispered as he drew the book out. His straggly gray hair lay matted on the hood of his very long red robes; the elf swore he would trip on them in a matter of seconds. 

The old man stepped down the ladder and placed one of the books from the teetering stack in his arms on the front desk. He then peered down at the child over his round glasses and smiled broadly exposing his slightly crooked yellowing teeth. 

“No

“You!” He whispered

“Me?” The elf said pointing at himself.

“I thought-“ the man began

“I’m sorry, let alone how he knew him. 

The old man turned his head back and forth between the elf and the child. He raised his furry eyebrows so high that the elf thought they might merge into his hairline. The commotion outside was growing louder

“Do you have a back way out of here?” The child asked anxiously

The old man nodded as he looked through the curtain out the window. “We haven’t much time

Cam stood silent for a moment

“Thought as much, you better say ‘no’, understand?” He looked very seriously down at Cam, the little girl nodded her head. 

“Good, behind the old rune rug, see that it is unlocked,” he said to Cam. The child nodded and zoomed from where she stood through the shelves and was soon gone. 

The old man sighed and rubbed his glasses with the sleeve of his long robe. “I hoped to never see you again Firi,” he paused, “and who am I to question such a witty power?” ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1hcaud/just_finished_chapter_3_of_my_novel_and_this_is/

----------------------------------------

He was suffocating. His throat constricted

His face was ashen

Something dark had been behind him. Something had been in the trees. He cast bleary eyes in the direction he'd fled from but saw nothing. No

But now as he watched he saw only trees that stood silent

His furtive glances around him confirmed that the wood surrounded him on all sides. But directly before him

He struggled to kneel but his movements were awkward and clumsy. He felt like he was waking from the deepest sleep.

Trembling violently he looked back from where he'd fled. He couldnt go back that way

He laboured to breathe

He felt so confused and groggy. It was an oak

Why was that owl so intent on him!? He looked hard at the oak-man and where there were acorns there were now eyes. Eyes that scowled down at him. An oak-man with scornful eyes and all overgrown with vines that..fluttered.

This was ludicrously wrong. A fresh grip of fear threatened to strangle him. Falling backwards he tried to push himself away from the strange man of oak and the granite beast on which it crouched. But that way lead back to the trees. He cast his eye over his shoulder into the wood

Where a moment ago there was a man of oak there was now just a man. It wasn't vines that swathed his body but...a cloak! The man was wearing a cloak. But still the owl looked on.

""Help me"".

His voice croaked pitifully. He must have looked wretched and the owl offered him no sympathy. That bird was making him mad with its glaring. He glared back to show the ruddy beast how angry he was.

Only it wasn't an owl, but now it wasn't even a bird.

It was a quiver

Abruptly the spinning in his head became still and everything became clear.

It was a man kneeling on a rock that looked down at him. He was slender and clothed all in grey and green, he again noticed the mans eyes. They were so bright, so silver, yet so cold and distant.

They were the eyes of a man no doubt. Just not the eyes of a human.

I want the reader to leave the story on a slight upbeat - I want this to be a positive step for her. Obviously, who seems a decent sort, dies for her safety, and that's a downer. I can't make her swing too broad, though, or it won't play believably.

(X-post from /r/writing)",3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1ama83/how_to_create_a_name_a_quick_guide_xpost_from/,"**Preface**

Hello all! I'm quite new to this subreddit
This guide is meant to help the reader create names that correspond to the character, as that is my favorite genre, but it should also provide food for thought for authors of other genres.
 I shall do my best
And yes

**Realism**
(Is the name appropriate for your character?)
How do you make a name? Sure there are generators, but those, as often as not, will create a name that doesn't really fit the character. For example, do you think it would be realistic for a peasant to be named something like Andravegnon Drehalian? 
First of all, certainly not something as extravagant as the example's. 

But still, and wouldn't have time to appreciate a lengthy name. Also, your parents probably didn't have the imagination for a colossus of a name like that. However, a name like Jass, or Crick Tagger would be plausible. 

Parentage is very important in a name

&gt;If you are writing fiction and you have a character, don't call them Theodore. 


This may seem like an obvious example, a less relevant in stories set in recent times because of how many names there already are in existence. Stereotypes will be made, but that's what the reader of your story expects. And it saves you some trouble, as a character with a peculiar name will require an explanation, something that could detract from the main story.

**Shorter is Better (Sometimes)** 
(A personal opinion)
As a reader, Mirandra, or Andra will suffice. Even removing parts of a name helps. Also take into account that word of mouth may change the name of a place (Wren's Town to Renton, etc). However, I can understand longer names. They can help emphasize the importance of a place, or illustrate the artistic or cultural style of a race. Or just generally look cool.

**Think About What Your Character Did/Does/Is Like**
(Kinda important)
When choosing a name, appearance, etc. into account. They can form titles, nicknames, or even the name itself. Killed a witch? Jemmy Witchslayer. Lost nearly half a hand? Emrys Three-Finger. Modern names are harder to predict, as, again, which still applies in modern times. 

**Uniqueness** 
(Maudie, what?)
When naming characters, but skim over it. From there, they can learn what happens at a faster pace, without losing the meaning. 
So, try to change up the lengths. Again, Tom and Tim are easy to confuse, but Tommy and Tim aren't. Basically, try to 
give characters names that can't be easily confused.

**Some Final Words**
(Thanks for reading this far!)
Whew, this guide is meant for less experienced writers, and goes over some basic ideas for creating names. Feel free to use your imagination to create names, as those are the most unique. However, for those looking for some inspiration and guidance, I give you this guide. Happy writing!

1330718776.0,qew5a,I write an encyclopaedia of facts about the cultures and regions described in my book so that I do not confuse facts or have to backtrack through dozens of pages to find one small tidbit. Here is the write up for one of my cultures. Does anyone else do anything like this?,thetaubadel,12,1,25,"Sa’guri

The Sa'guri were originally a group of twelve to sixteen warring tribes, or emperors. By banding together, the twelve tribes spread their influence across what is now considered the Sa'guri region, and a shared culture with a focus on martial prowess and conquer developed.

The original twelve to sixteen tribes were culturally diverse, the actual populations of the Sa’guri cities lived outside of the walls of the city. Due to their vulnerability and the constant presence of attacks from other tribes, the cities were often ramshackle, temporary affairs, which could be rebuilt hastily after their destruction. This is a trend which resurfaced with the rise of the Alchemists, as the Black Alchemical Sect that rules the Sa’guri lands do not allow the citizenry within the walls of their fortresses.

Sa’guri are generally tall and lean, leading to a shared design to their clothing. Generally they wear light, comfortable clothing, often dyed in purples and browns. The men wear traditionally beaded vests called wasals, and the women often bind and cover their hair. They are also the first culture to bind their forearms with cloth to prevent loose sleeves from impeding their work, a practice that has spread to other cultures over time. Men are usually clean-shaven, but the danal and the priesthood grow beards

The Sa’guri tribes each originally worshipped their own gods, the Westbound Sun. A god of the sun and of war, he battles the four moons for control of the sky. Each day he is habitually slain, to rise again the next morning. This death and rebirth cycle is celebrated each summer solstice with feasting and ceremonial fights representing Sa’guri myths. It is also a habitual practice to worship classical Sa’guri heroes, as it is believed that anyone who can perform twelve great acts of valor before death will be raised to serve as Bra’tur’s own army against the moons and their stars. The priesthood practice ritual sacrifice of animals and, once a year, will travel to the eastern-most point of Sa’guri to sacrifice a young man and a young woman by tossing them from the steep cliffs there.

Sa’guri architecture, but is brightly painted with depictions of battles and mythological figures. Squared doors, tall pillars and reed-like carvings are commonly seen in Sa’guri fortresses. Sa’guri build large, low buildings, unlike the tall towers of their western cousins, the Dre’en. Sa’guri statuary often depicts bulls or yoked oxen, the symbol of Bra’tur. Arenas are common in Sa’guri cities, and is fed by natural hotsprings nearby.

Sa’guri men have a tradition of fighting to the death. When a dispute cannot be resolved by diplomatic means, if both men die in a dispute over a physical possession, said possession is taken by the priesthood. The fight as an importance in the Sa’guri justice system, as it is said that during the fights, all men are equal, and Bra’tur alone decides their fate. No one man has the power to decide who lives and who dies. This is, of course, as no two men are equally matched in the fights

Women are equally counted as possessions in Sa’guri culture, a suitor for a woman against other men. The highest bidder pays and is married to the woman. Another way of winning a bride is through force of arm. If a man kidnaps a woman and spends three days with her, they are considered married, even if she was already married. It is believed that a man who cannot defend his wife does not deserve one. If, however, the kidnapper is caught and killed by the woman’s owner, all of his wives are given to the one who killed him, he can sell her to the highest bidder.

The Sa’guri leader is a danal. Danali were originally great warriors who won their position from the previous danal by killing him. Now, as the Black Alchemists rule Sa’guri, place laws and collect taxes. However, the Blacks do support the danal, as he is often turned to by the citizenry as a source of divine word. Over time, the position of danal became a holy one, as he is believed to be an avatar of Bra’tur on earth, the Black Alchemists let him live a life of luxury so that he can help sate the populace when the Alchemists do something the Sa’guri do not like.

Sa’guri lands (usually called Sa’guri, which lies along the Illswater River and the western coast of Lake Ka’vuri.

Sveid is one of the Valkyries. Sigurd and each of the women in the vignettes carries with them or reflects some aspect of the spirit of Sveid. 

I did a write-up of the story on the website for my company

I hope to become a more active part of the community here and I thought that introducing myself would be a good way to begin. I guess you could consider this an AMA of sorts. If you want to know something

So much of fantasy is extremely dark. For some readers it's too much actually. They don't sense the hope and they quit reading. You have to sense that the hero ""has an ace up his(her) sleeve"". But I think this is just as true of the author. To come back to it day after day

The axe damn near opened my throat right up as it went sailing past my face, going for my face again, but this time I brought my shield arm up and slammed the rounded wood straight into his wrist, knocking the axe flying away and no doubt shattering the unarmoured fool’s wrist. Before he had time to recoil from his disarming, I brought my dagger up and slammed it straight into his gut. I pulled it out and stabbed him again, leaving the dagger in as I knocked him to the ground with my shield, leaving him to bleed out as I looked around me.

From the corner of her eye Sky saw the boy struggle, hoping she was seeing things. It was only the dark playing tricks on her. The boy was dead, like the rest of his family, all five of them laid out in a neat row on the kitchen floor.
 
Heavy footsteps thudded across the ceiling as the rest of the clean-up team arranged the home to make it look like the family had left in a hurry. The clerk back at the guildhouse had already forged one-way ticket stubs for the portal to some dead-end village as far from the city of Drien as one could get.
 
She glanced down at the wet ink of the disintegration spell-form she’d drawn on the tiles. It was the worst part of the job
 
Another frail movement caught her attention
 
She knew she should kill the boy. That was her job, she put it back there.

Taking in a deep breath, she should tell him. But she couldn’t.
 
The boy weighed next to nothing. She lifted him from the ground

His arms and legs thrashed about
 
“Mam. Da
 
Sky gritted her teeth. Don’t listen to him. He’s a corpse. Probably be dead by morning.
 
Tall mansions overshadowed the laneway, scanning the dirty walls for blankets or boxes or other evidence of street-sleepers. There. At the end of this lane. She made her way over to them and laid the boy on the cool stone, beside a man who huddled into his blanket and snored lightly.
 
“For what it’s worth
 
He stared at her as she backed away, but she grabbed it tight and forced it back down. A dying boy, no matter how disturbing his stare, was no threat to her and certainly not worth releasing the awful magic within her.
 
Once she rounded the corner, and he’d probably die by morning anyway.

Basically I've had a story idea running around my head for awhile now.  It features a simple farming family living on the edges of civilization.  The parents are getting along in years and concerned about their children etc.  The oldest, spends more time worrying about his family then himself.  The youngest an idyllic young woman who never really bonded with people outside the family, spends most of her days talking to the farm animals and the odd inanimate object.  Then one day some slavers show up and drag the youngest off.  The middle one takes what little magic knowledge he has and what little money the family had saved and chases after them, the oldest follows despite being told repeatedly to go home.  Without actually having to write the whole story out the older brother dies on the journey, and after the better part of a decade the middle brother finally rescues his sister who had spent the last years of her life being brutalized, (and her child)  they finally get home and their parents had died a few winters ago in a blizzard.  No happy ending, everybody is either dead or broken mentally

Iphis flung his pack to the ground signaling to his companions that he needed to break again. He perched himself against an old

""And be quick about it!"" Iphis snapped. He had little patience for his newly hired assistant. She was too old, so she had hired an extracted caregiver from the Southern Gens, Malwabai, to aid Iphis on his journey. Teza was her name. Dark skin and hair, she was slightly hunched in the back, and smelt of pepper and garlic. Her skin naturally warm, but she wasn't accustomed to the Autumn chill that had taken most of Sidel of late. She covered herself in thick dark fabrics, to keep warm. Iphis half thought she resembled the mischievous crows from his grandmothers old stories that she told him

Teza unzipped Iphis's pack and from it, gulping the water hard and quick. In doing so, he began to choke. Teza bent down to pat Iphis on the back, to help the water along, he started to cough as his other two companions began to laugh.

""It...isn't....funny!"" Iphis yelled at them, motioned for Teza to stop patting his back, and to take the canteen away.

""I don't mean to laugh, that had fallen from a deciduous tree. She laid horizontally on top of them, her head rested on her snatchel, staring up at the forest sky. Allison was the same height as Iphis. She had his red hue. Ginger hair, that had once been long as a horse's mane, now brunette and shoulder lengthed. She shared Iphis's pale skin, and freckled face. Iphis wan't as svelte though, but any passing stranger could have sworn they shared the same womb.

Iphis looked at her with contempt. This was her enviroment, could better me, shame me, at the wide outdoors! A humiliating thought that Iphis had always kept to himself.

It wasn't enough that the old crow his mother had hired to care for him could out pace him, and a year his junior, had taken the role of leader on this expedition that Iphis saw himself on. This had to be embarrassing for Allison's older sister, Max, as well, thought Iphis. To be lead by her younger? The horror!

Iphis looked upon his other cousin. Max was as diminutive and emaciated as all Easterners were rumored to be. She sat in the sun away from the shade of the giant blackwood, Iphis could tell. 

Iphis was fond of Max. He could relate to her more. She was quiet, her mind was elsewhere. On home, thought Iphis. 

A gust of wind had blown the black hood from atop Max's head. Max didn't bother to fetch it. A brief smile appeared across Iphis's face. Max had been trying to hide her newly shortened black hair from Allison and him since they had set off, her tan complexion had always contrasted with the typcially bright colored fabrics of the Sidel people. She had taken to black, something her deceased mother did not take kindly too. Black suited her, Iphis thought. And here she sat before him dressed in all black to match her newly shortened dark hair.

Dear Agent

I am SO glad I was able to pitch to you. Thanks for the opportunity. You were fantastic. I hope you'll love my story.

Homunculus and the Cat is about alchemically made, nine times. It is the story of the intelligent, color-changing, winged, magical cat, a human named Tyro, several homunculi and their collective deaths.


The refugees at a homunculus sanctuary in Atlantis are vying for equality, don't want to give them their freedom so easily. Funding is limited at the sanctuary, especially after the fire, and the makeshift family will accept any help they can get, so long as it doesn't mean going back to the Yakuza. They would rather face the entire Persian navy. An angry clan of mermaids with giant armored battle squids? Sure. Tempt the wrath of the gods? No problem. Anything to gain global recognition of their independence.

The book is just under 70, is about eight weeks old, but Tyro, the other main character is in his early twenties. He's from the ""real world,"" but this is not the story of how he crossed over into the world of myth. It is the story of how he finally finds a cause worth fighting for, love worth dying for and the best sushi joint on the planet.

Homunculus and the Cat is the second novel I have written in the series but it is entirely a standalone work. I plan on rewriting its predecessor, at which time I will return to the world of Homunculus and the Cat for the extension of that series.

I have taught writing as a tutor at the University of Utah for over three years and study the craft as often as chance allows. I see no other future for myself than a full time writing career

Homunculus and the Cat is about alchemically made, nine times. It is also about their human friend Tyro, and how he, with the cat, gets caught up in their cause to achieve globally recognized independence and in doing so, their multiple collective deaths. The various mafias, specifically the Yakuza, are provoked by the movement. They have released Shikome

The refugees at the homunculus sanctuary in Atlantis may be vying for equality, and the makeshift family will accept any help they can get, so long as it doesn't mean going back to the Yakuza. Tyro and the cat have never cared about anything so much in their lives but they aren’t homunculi.

They face the entire Persian navy, just to prove to the world that it doesn’t matter what you are made of, but what you make with it.

1. There's litter lying on the streets and even the Christmas tree outside the library looks forlorn.

1. The other passengers were much cleaner than me too, which they seemed to think gave them the right to look down their noses at me.

1. Instead of running through city streets firing military weapons, noise, population density, food acceptance, all sorts of things that humans might face as resources dwindled.

What about the pro samples separates them from the amateur samples

------------------

Answers

I have to say, and I leaned ""Pro"" for that item. All the others, the ""pro"" ones read professionally, and the ""amateur"" ones read amateurishly. I think there's probably something to learn from that, but I'm not sure what.

Here're the results, that still wouldn't feel right. 

1. [Character name] sheepishly put down the milk jug and picked up the teapot

  **Amateur**. 9/12 people got this right.

  What gave it away for me (if I didn't pick it myself) would have been the great attention paid to the detail - a pro, because if the character wasn't going to bash someone's head in with the pot, s/he was going to pour tea. Since that action is a given, there's no reason to show it. If the china was important, it could have been shown in the transaction between tea-pourer and recipient.

1. There's litter lying on the streets and even the Christmas tree outside the library looks forlorn.

  **Pro**That's Jo Walton

  What makes me come down as ""pro"" on this is the very thing that someone thought wrong - the forlorn tree. It's a type of thing that amateurs often don't think to do

1. It was as if the last thirty-six hours had never happened, riding the carousel in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, on his first trip back to the States, a marathon journey by ship and by car, his mother standing there, watching him proudly, and himself sucking his melted Popsicle, hoping that the music would never stop

  **Pro** Neil Gaiman

  So many people came down on this one as amateur, well, amateurish. In Gaiman's hands this is gorgeous... it's a run-on, sure, but it's a beautiful run-on. 

1. The other passengers were much cleaner than me too, which they seemed to think gave them the right to look down their noses at me.

    **Amateur**. 8/12 right

  It wasn't the first person that flipped me to amateur - there are lots of great pro 1p stories out there. Rather, grammatically speaking, but artistically they worked for me. The ""which..."" bit, though, was a new thought.
  
1. Instead of running through city streets firing military weapons, noise, population density, food acceptance, all sorts of things that humans might face as resources dwindled.

    **Amateur**. 9/12 right
    
  It threw me how many folks thought this one was pro. To me, though.
  
1.   He was a tall man, we would have known him at once for an infiltrator--he had the body of a man who ate meat every day.

  **Pro**. David Benioff

Suken Anisaria’s just starting out as a bounty hunter in D’n’cade, a hatful of his dead uncle’s debts to pay off, and the talent and drive to become one of the best hunters in the city.  The problem is, no one else believes that he’s destined to be the best.  So when a murder warrant goes up for Fletch Greencloak, he jumps on the chance to track down the notorious thief and make a name for himself.  

Hunting’s never an easy job, but Suken’s got contacts that give him an edge on the competition.  He’s certain that he’s got this case in the bag… but the whole job goes sour when he uncovers evidence that Greencloak is being framed for the murders.  The guards won’t take action without hard evidence, but evidence is hard to find when professional assassins begin tailing his every step.  He can’t call in help from the other bounty hunters without jeopardizing his reputation, so he’s forced to take drastic measures, measures he never thought he’d consider.  He teams up with the notorious thief he was supposed to bring to justice.

~~Hunting’s never an easy job, but he finally gets a solid lead. He thinks that he’s got this case in the bag… but the whole job begins to go sour when he uncovers evidence that Greencloak is being framed for the murders. The guards won’t take action without hard evidence, and someone in the city obviously doesn’t want Suken finding any. Assassins begin hunting him and those he loves, and he can’t tell the other bounty hunters about Greencloak’s innocence without jeopardizing his reputation. With no other options, Suken is forced to team up with the notorious thief, who turns out to be very different from what Suken had expected.~~

~~The two have to learn to work through differences in ideology and a generous portion of romantic tension in order to catch the real killer before the assassins manage to catch up with Suken

No response came from the dilapidated cottage

“Come on out Dob

“Liar!” boomed a distant voice. Damn, not the shack. Higher ground. “Liar!”

Brouse wheeled to the right

“Put it down Brouse.” Payte whispered.

Brouse leveled his hand at the ground but continued to squint suspiciously at the ridge. His thick bald head was glistening wet. Small

“On your knees

“We’re only here to talk”

“On your knees!” Dobb spat. “Or we end it here

The desert sands felt warm against Payte’s legs as he followed the order. He fought back the urge to reach for the charring deer as the scent wafted unmercifully around him. It had been days since they had found decent game, the shadow’s feet stopped over his right shoulder.

Payte lowered his head but peered beneath his arm catching a glimpse of a shimmering pale silhouette.

“Gods man

The tattered remains of Dobb’s uniform seemed to slip and weave. Ducking, it simply hung freely in the air at a fixed point as the flesh and cloth of Payte’s former seargent rose and fell, breathing around it. Dobb had only a hint of hands emerging from his dark blue sleeves. There were no boots, only pale glassy calves terminating into a tangle of foot-like mist.

“Why did you come?”, Payte. How much can they take from us? I’m nearly gone, why can’t they just let me die out here alone. And how much silver lines your pockets now? Was it worth the lives? Do you dream sweetly knowing that your pockets jingle with the bounties of your friends?

“You don’t understand. No one sent us, you’re a hero.”

Even as he spoke, Brouse had lifted his pistol and leveled the sights on Dobb. The flint fell against the steel plate of the lock with a decisive click dragging spark to powder. Dobb raised his hand as thunder spoke a moment later as the powder in the pistol exploded. The breach flashed and the iron gave way, throwing smoke and light in all directions as the handle became a mass of burning splinters flying through the air. Brouse roared as fingers and flesh exploded, eyes wide with disbelief.

Payte instinctively reached to the soft, eyes closed, as the pain mounted. The crescendo of agony turned to bliss as the wall exploded outward and drove Dobb to the edge of the fire’s flickering light. Brouse was still propped neatly on his knees blinking at the smoldering stump of his mangled left arm, the bubbling remains dripping from smoking bones, burnt black by the overcharge of powder.

Meanwhile, the comet-like manifestation lurched forward and crashed against the protective dome with a shower of sparks and heat.

1375362946.0,1jhplu,Does this qualify as fantasy?,Debatable_Dogma,12,2,12,"Hi all

First, and I thought you'd be able to help me out. I'm currently writing a first novel, it's only really for my own sake as it's something I enjoy doing.

Anyway, because there is a fair amount of fantastical stuff going on, my protagonist is a young man (around 20) who had a vision of a ghostly hand in a forest whose presence now leads him to places and new experiences. I guess my question is, how much fantasy does a book need for it to qualify as fantasy? There's a lot of realism still in the story, but it's just that the main storyline is driven by the vision and overwhelming presence of this 'thing'. I guess it's a big ask but if you'd be willing to have a quick look that'd be awesome, the 'fantasy' stuff is around page 10.

1373798478.0,1i9r8m,What do you think of large time-line gaps between books?,photonlongsword,10,0,15,"Hi there.

I'm currently in the midst of writing a series of four books, lets call it the Cul-Khara Sequence, is meant to be able to be read as a stand-alone novel. I have nothing against a long series similar to ASoIaF, but it just isn't the kind of story I want to write. The books are largely linked by their themes and the fact that they share a world, albeit at quite different stages of history.

Book 1 takes place in 1630-33 of this world - an equivalent time would be similar to the 1850's. In this book a number of world-altering events occur. Genocide is committed, so roughly forty years later. In this book you see the long-term ramifications of Book 1, as well as a story with a largely new cast of characters. Some characters on the fringe of Book 1 now take centre stage, small companies now are major corporations, parkland at the edge of the city is now a slum. By the end of Book 2, Fobbington has seen a near cataclysmic event. Its monarchy has been slaughtered, and the Minister of Internal Affairs took control in a short and bloody military coup. Funnily enough

Book 3 takes another leap in history, now its own city-state. Technology has advanced significantly, and the plot centres upon the government initiating a city wide surveillance system. All sorts of shenanigans take place: there is an attempted revolution, which nearly succeeds. Ultimately, though, the people give power back to their duchess and decide to return to their sub-par lives.

By Book 4, on a society's first attempted breach of the 'final frontier.' Nine astronauts are sent on the expedition, whereupon they discover a ghost civilisation. Things go horribly wrong. The whole story is narrated by the last of the astronauts as she waits for her oxygen to run out.

Throughout the series it becomes clear that events from each of the books affect one another. There are instances where actions in the future affect the past - unexplained events in Book 1 being a result of actions in Book 4, from its prior failures. I want to show how consequences matter both immediately and generations after the fact. I want readers to really feel the history of this world, not as something bolted to the tail-end of my narrative but as something that is living and evolving over each volume. Even though I do not particularly like his books, I understand that Brandon Sanderson has done something like this with his Mistborn books.

The story is set in the same feudal/medieval/fantasy/semi-steampunk world as my others.  It features the main character as an elf and a sort of religious witch-hunter (think a blend of Solomon Kane, with a mission from the setting's Vatican-esque faction to hunt down and bring to justice a threatening and evil necromancer.

Over time, he begins to form or already has a previous history with either the antagonist or one of his major villainous henchmen that continually stokes the fires of his vengeance and duty.  In my setting, elves are intrinsically empathetic to the general emotions of those around them and the health and stress of the earth itself, so all of the violent acts taken or witnessed by the main character continually take a toll on him throughout the series.

The idea for this character and story came to me when I was reading about pulp fiction.  While the story and setting I'm going to be writing in will be serious, I want the main character to have a sort of ""believable ridiculousness"" to him - one of the main things I love about the witch hunter archetype is the vast array of weaponry available to him, and this is something I intend to carry over into my story.  I'd like the main character to have a bit of a superhero vibe to him, and to be generally armed to the teeth with all manner of sword, axe, flintlock, hand crossbow, and potions.

Blood soaked into the thin layer of snow on the ground, on their side of the caravan. The whiz of arrows filled the air, as the attackers sat in their foxholes, and fired on the pinned men. Orcish archers, dug well into the rocks. The singing of bows was constant, and those men didn't have much time left. The wind and rain fell on his weathered face slowly. His beard was drenched by the water. He donned his helm, its leather sides and metal cap were cold on the inside, and the links were beaded with water. His thin leather gloves clasped an axe in one hand, and had clearly been waiting there for quite some time. “They’ve got no way to move, Garnter sat crouched in the shadow of an overhang

“Erik

“That's not my choice to make lord.” He responded.

“It is if I ask it of you

“We need to help those men

“Agreed

“I'm not the one trained in military strategy lord.”

“No

                      He signaled for the crossbowmen to move, looking down on the ambushers. Erik Marsen pulled his own war axe off of his belt, and clasped it tightly. Garnter gave the signal. They charged down the hill. Blades in the air, they poured over the rocks, screaming at the top of their lungs. One of the archers turned toward him, fear in his eyes. Erik hit him so hard the poor orc was lifted off his feet, and tossed down the hill, reducing it to a stump. The retort of the crossbows was heard, and driving the sword through his chest. Now the battle was all around them, and saw the bowman perched on a rock

                    He heard a fell cry, rainwater pouring down around the two of them. Erik brought up his shield, sending the first blow bouncing off the oak with a dull thump His own axe flew through the air, narrowly missing his opponent. The orc wrenched his sword form Erik’s shield, and swung, all his weight behind it. The wind rushed out of him, the sword dug into the chainmail, barely holding back the blade from his stomach. The other man lunged, the sword tumbled to the ground, or were already dead. Erik sat down heavily. ""I’m getting too old for this."" he said quietly.

“Erik

“So it would seem Adieke.” Erik responded. Adieke was new blood
with good looks

“Here

“Healing potion

“You're sure that the alchemist you bought this from was trustworthy?” Erik was always suspicious of magic users. “If it doesn’t work, touched the vial to his lips, and drank. He felt the potion take effect at once. Relief and warmth swept throughout his body, he felt his wound seal and though some pain stayed, he was fine.

“What are orcs doing this far east?”

“I’m not an orc

“I never said you were

“Looks like our friends aren’t very happy we saved them.” Adieke commented. Erik looked toward the caravan, archers poking out from behind wagons, training their weapons on their saviors. Opposite them Granter stood. Adieke was beside him, now so were two others. The crossbowmen came down from the cliff, and joined their line. Slowly, the band of bloody warriors formed up. They outnumbered the guards 4 to one, and all of them were better armed, well said indeed.” came a voice. Muddied boots steped out from behind one of the caravans. A merchantman clad in orange and purple silks walked toward the party. “Lower your weapons you bloody idiots, Granter of Black Hill.”

Dixon

It was raining again, where every day wasn’t a reminder of his isolation. Only then the rain was snow. He stopped, his cloak coming to rest at boot height, his chainmail shuffling and coming to rest at last, he stood and listened. He felt water drip as the metal rings of his hood had rested against his forehead. He heard rain plinking off the iron cap helm he wore, and watched it run down the nose guard that dropped down the middle of his face. He shifted letting his bastard sword swing in its scabbard, clanking against the oaken shield on his back. He glanced down, the white tunic he wore over his mail. He studied it for a few moments, sheather, and the sash ending about the middle of his thigh. He at last looked up

“Dixon

“Aye old man.” he replied

“At least I can keep up.”He replied
grizzled face was covered in wrinkles, his bearskin cloak flowing as he walked, his massive great axe, Bear strapped to his back. Dixon jogged over, catching up in a few long strides. Next to them walked Father Browsten, his thing brown hair illuminated by the lantern he carried at his side. His mace swung at his hip, next to it his iron cap.
“Thought you had left us there for awhile child.” said the cleric
“Not to worry father, Dixon’s mail , and the rain all becoming one harmonious racket. The silence was shattered at once, out of the woods rushed a figure. A another man came crashing through the undergrowth, and stumbled into the pathway before the trio. The racquet his warhammer made was not even apparent, despite the din of the rain. His beard was, as Trower’s was, except his went halfway down his chest, sucking in air

“Ganath spotted something on the road coming behind us!” Berin said.

“What?” Trower asked

“Armed men, coming this way.” “What sigil did they bear?” Trower interjected “I’m 
not sure

“They bear the sigil of House Verigron.” came a voice. All of them turned their eyes to the source of this new voice. Out of the brush came Ganthar
about his boots

“Leave it too and elf to scare you shitless.” Dixon said.

“It’s more fun that way.” he responded

“Verigon? If Verigon is on the move they're sure to be trouble about.”

“Well we’ve done them no harm after all

“Trower, and it’ll soon be night, a time during 
which I’d rather be with an armed column than with just a few men.” Dixon said

“Agreed.” Ganthar said.

“They’ll be on us soon, trouble starts, you run as fast and as far as you can.” Trower ordered, moving to face the direction from which the riders would come. Dixon gave a nod following Ganthar and Father Browsten off the path and into a cluster of rocks among the trees on the inclined hill. They all settled, eyes darting around, ears on end listening. Dixon could feel the butterflies joining in his stomach, his heart beginning to race, were silent for the exception of the lashing rain. Then,,

The trouble I'm coming to is that, you just barrel ahead with it and work out the plot holes when you edit. The second is that you plan nearly everything out beforehand; the world, the characters, the ""important bits"" and then, when you have that, you write it.

With my current work I'm trying to do a bit of both; I have the skeletal structure of a world in my head, I know big things that happen throughout the story, and I'm reasonably comfortable with an end.

So then I try to delve into worldbuilding a bit more, but then before I can think of what I need to, I need to build about a hundred other things (full geography, history, myths and legends, important people, it all feels like it's so much when all I want to do is get over the hump that I'm against and keep writing.

This morning I was trying to break down a scene in which nothing much happens - my WIP introduces the big bad and his big bad ways in a prologue

I was stumped

So I brainstormed for a bit

And then I says to myself, that's going to be a yawner.""

And once I had that idea...random goal generator, here we come, I don't have it coded yet. But I randomly picked 3 numbers, poked through the table... and protag 1's goal was to bespell someone; protag 2's goal was to chart something, and the survivor's goal was to seduce someone. That was all I needed - Character 2 was going to try to map the scene, the survivor's symptoms, etc., because of who she was, with the attendant side effects--to save her own life. Everything fell into place in about 20 minutes after that - this is gonna be a great scene

All of which is to say... when you're stuck in a scene that's just not working, the character's overall scene goal, and the character's personality (and flaws!), and see where it takes you... might be somewhere awesome.",,False,,False,t3_1bo6k0

This reminds me of if you haven't guessed it already Theon greyjoy. Secondly and I need to give you a little backstory here so get ready. A long time ago the Goddess Eloiris created the planet but when the humans started to develop and change etc she was unhappy because it wasn't what she had created and so to punish them she destroyed the planet in the hopes of rebuilding. Her sisters however locked her away and rebuilt the planet themselves but couldn't remember all the details of the world so they made what they remembered and then filled in the gaps with parts of their own worlds. This left the world a little more plain and boring to what it was before. Now that's over with my plan is to have the Goddess escape and start creating her old species again with the hopes that the monsters she creates kill the people themselves so she can't be blamed. This is only a rough idea but it will end up something like this. Do you think that's too close to the white walkers coming back because I'm going to have fairly normal things going on for most of the time involving humans who will be moving the story along with their actions and then have some more mystical elements come in and try to kill the humans.

Magical abilities are present in about 4% of the human population. What magic can do is not strictly limited in any way, certain people are better at different things, so most humans will specialize in a few techniques, such as:

Natural magic, tracking a person by the unique ""scent"" of their life essence

Physical magic, healing, causing pain), concussive blasts

Mental magic, memory fabrication/deletion, telepathy, sensing whether others can use magic, mental attacks (essentially punching you in the brain with my brain), interfering with others' use of magic

and elemental magic

Spellcasters can also charm objects to react to a touch or human presence, or incinerating everyone within a five mile radius.

(Lizard-folk live for several thousand years, many will specialize and become damn good at whatever area they pick.)

For a human, causes extreme pain and permanent bodily harm as the magic essentially rips your flesh apart as it courses through you. To prevent this, human spellcasters must carry with them an item with the right properties to act as a conduit, usually in the form of a ring or armband. Common materials include wood, metal, and crystal. The most prized material for these conduits is a crystalline mineral not found naturally on the planet, but one that is sometimes delivered via meteorites, and over time

Magic is physically and mentally taxing just like any other labor, at which point they let it go gently. If they do lose control, it can have devastating effects on the caster's mind, which, depending on the amount of magic they were tapping into and how badly they screwed up, can range from mild disorientation for a few minutes, to permanent brain damage, using their powers full-time to keep the city or town running smoothly (e.g. driving away pests, etc.)

I applaud anyone who made it through that. The main character is not a spellcaster (though he does have a passive magical ability unique to him), though magic does play an important role in the story, so I want to make sure that there aren't any contradictions and that the system I have isn't like, completely lame. Also, if something was unclear or doesn't make sense, questions are appreciated.

Hope it's useful!

(Remember

--------

&gt; Consider the reader as a blind person. Right now he's standing with you on the edge of a journey. He has his hand on your shoulder

&gt; There is no ""best"" way to lead him; every journey is different, and he's going to lose the thread, fall off a cliff, wander into a dark corner and be eaten by a grue; not enough, and he's just as doomed. Too early or in the wrong order, and it's useless to him. Too late, he's worm-food. But if you get it just right


So how does this work in practice?

* Lead the reader smoothly. Don't jump around (look at this! look at that! he's thinking this! she's doing that!) within a paragraph unless it's your goal to disorient the reader. 

* Consider what the reader needs to know *right now* to understand what's going on. Does the reader *need* the history of the Fallen Lands at this moment

* Choose wisely what gets highlighted by the choices you make as a writer. Whatever gets focus in that moment is the most important thing in the reader's mind. Are the notches on the blade of Subpar's family-heirloom sword the most important thing *right now* for the reader? If so

    This requires the writer to know what he or she wants to accomplish. This might not come in the first draft

* Pairing with the previous bullet

* Consider how to ""inclue"" the reader such that the reader can draw their own conclusions. You're not only guiding the reader through the journey - you're giving him what he needs to find his own way across the journey, because  a reader being told everything is a reader who tunes out and disengages.

First, as well as ancient patterns of glaciation and warming. Then I'm going to write a (very rough) evolutionary history of how one group of early progenitors evolved and -- due to various pressures -- how that ancestor race split into the races that eventually became the elder races: Elves, Dwarves, and Goblins.

Then, as well as the traits that evolved among the different races (or the traits that emerged when those races came back in contact with eachother and interbred). As a part of that, I'm developing not only an ethnographic history of the sentient races involved -- in terms of when their civilizations arose, how they arose, how one might displace another, etc -- but also I'm fleshing out the religious histories of these cultures. And I mean, not just, throwing together a pantheon for each culture -- I want to put together an evolving history of their respective religious beliefs that have changed over the centuries and millennia in an immitation (admittedly simplified) of the way that pantheons and religions change/evolve in the real world.

In theory, and the ethnic histories and religious evolution within those cultures will then help me shape the economic and military histories of these societies, which is to say, the histories of how the different races/cultures in this world have interacted in the past.

Once I have all that -- a formed world, rises, falls, and ruins that come from such a history -- I want to only then start trying to figure out what my story will be about, what sort of characters are in that story, and what their motivation is, and what they're trying to achieve. I want the characters and the story to organically come from a preexisting world, and then building a world around them. The idea is to make the final experience more like writing historical fiction -- only I'm also making up the history. BUT. I'm making it up before I even begin to come up with a story. Or stories.

And I came up with one centered on music. While I do play music

First off, people who can influence the world with music through the four elements (and also the mind.) These people can use their voice to make music. They can also create gems to put onto instruments so that instruments can channel magic too. 

The different elements are assigned to different keys.

A
C
E flat and E influence fire
F influences mind
and G flat and G produce air. 

Now, and is very profitable, but a blank gem is required.) they can attach it to an instrument, as I've already said. However, once they attach it to an instrument, say a violin, that violin can play in any key, a violin with a fire gem will only produce fire

If a musician has the spark and intent, behave like another element if he plays in its key. For example, if he plays in the key of C with a fire violin, and he is skilled enough, he can make liquid fire. Otherwise it will just create regular fire. 

Major and Minor also play a role. Major tends to make the positive aspects of an element, or even kill them if the musician is skilled enough. (They absolutely need a gem for that though, not even the voice can produce this effect, and in the world, a gem has to have the minor aspect in order for this to happen, so F Minor gems are illegal.) 

Intent and skill also play a role. Unskilled musicians will have their instruments produce wild effects if they do not have mastery over it. They cannot make it do what they want, as some musicians call it.) 

When groups of musicians are together, there is only one large Symphony of musicians with the spark, called the King's Symphony. They are only given gems of water, earth and wind. Fire is occasionally allowed, such as when the Symphony sets out to create a storm, and they use a Minor Fire Gem to create lightening. 

Anyway, then shut up. :P)

1328538239.0,pd6d2,My New Magicsytem: Magic of the Souls,Sanderf90,9,1,16,"Been thinking a lot about this magicsystem of mine. I watched videos with Brandon Sanderson who explains what he considers great laws for magic and tried to merge those idea with my world.

This is what I came up with:


My world is split in half. A spiritworld and a physicalworld. The physical world is a world ruled by the sun. The plants get energy from the sun and the entire cycle of life is based around this. 

The Spiritworld is a world of the Moon. The Moon is nothing more than a cold dark rock in the physicalworld but in the spiritworld it is a source of energy similar to the sun. This energy is magic. 

Souls are the invisible magic in the physical world. While the energy of the sun makes things grow an thrive it is the soul that creates the personality of people. People theorized that each soul is bound with an element. 

If a human is intelligent but with a hunger to become smarter
and more powerful he has a Firesoul. This also ties with one of the 4 great Gods: Power.

If a human is passionate and caring

If a human is tied with nature

And if a person is loyal

Ofcourse every being has a combination of these 4 aspects in them. But one usually dominates the other.

Some people are capable of accessing this force: their soul. To perform magic. This magic will be significantly stronger with the element they are connected with. 

A number of mages are also capable of accessing magic from the Spiritworld; They can use the souls of people or animals that have died to perform amazing magic. Souls without a body degrade over time becoming less human and more violent but also more powerful. So the more powerful the soul the mage absorbs the more dangerous it is. They risk a change in personality

This magic is based on the moon. Just like the tides the spiritworld moves with the physical world being the closest on a full moon. This makes it easier for mages to access the spiritworld and sometimes causes spirits to pass through. 

The more magic a mage uses

My idea right now is that when someone chooses to become a magi, even a pocket watch). They can then draw on the power of that bit of their soul to cast spells. The bit of their soul has a set amount of energy and requires time to recharge, so each day the magi in question has limited energy to draw on. The more of their soul they sacrifice, the larger their pool of energy, but the less human they are. The more of their soul they sacrifice, the more their appearance and personality changes. Those who sacrifice their whole soul look like Nosferatu-esque vampires and can't stand the presence of light.

If they enemy gets too close, get out of there.’He scrambled out of the boat. The heavy footsteps of the Templars on the dunes sent scree skittering backwards.

Marcus Apple, he hurried along to the dockside city guard house. There were such places scatted throughout the city but he had been called on to go to the most active guardhouse in the worst place he knew of. On reflection Marcus  thought that there might be worse places still that he didn’t know about yet and found himself wishing he was back on the farm. 

Being a farmer was not a worthy profession in the eyes of an ambitious woman. Marring a farmer was all well and good, and get the barge sailors to pay half as much again for supplies as they made their way downriver past the family smallholding. It was clear who his father would relent to the nagging about going to join the broad middle class of the greatest city in the world. Marcus's only ambition was to remain at home, and set to prove his worth by cataloguing the herbs, tending the stills and fermenting vats and designing better tools. His efforts backfired spectacularly, winning him a scholarship to study in the renowned college of alchemists.

Still he supposed
 
The guardhouse was set near the waterfront by a jetty used for the smaller fishing boats. It stood out from the surrounding buildings as its yellow-red stone was not crowded with rickety wooden lean to stalls, they nodded back with scarcely contained contempt. 

The captain of the guardhouse had not shaved yet and his fresh stubble was still longer than Marcus's wispy efforts. Leaning back in his chair he stared down the gangly youth sitting on the other side of his desk before sighing deeply. 'We don’t get many alchemists down here

Marcus pulled an earthenware pint pot from his robes. 'I bring you a fresh supply of essence of grubroot

The captain of the guard stood up and handled the cork stoppered bottle. 'We don’t get many forgers in the old docks

'its not magic sir' stuttered Marcus

The captain smiled

'To serve a writ' Marcus pulled a folded document from his sleeve 'I am to recruit two able persons to leave immediately on a mission of trade to the Qulatharen Empire'. 

The captain brightened 'Well this is a fine start to the new year

Marcus coughed nervously. 'There is one condition

The captain laughed 'god be good
 
The cells where situated underground, be glad to be shot of them'. Swinging to the left the captain unlocked a barred door and stepped inside. 

Marcus had been expecting..well he hadn't been expecting anything yet the figure sitting chained to the wall still managed to surprise him. Her dirty blonde hair was tied back in a short ponytail and she wore the leather trousers and fur lined jerkin that instantly marked her as hailing from the far north. 'Seen enough
 
'I'm not a merchant
 
'Nina

Brandishing a piece of paper Marcus began 'I have a proposition of great significance'. 

Nina shook her head 'papers? I don’t trust paper

A second figure who had been concealed utterly in the dark corner of the cell crawled forwards on his knees. Unlike the Northerners simple garb, barbarian?' he half sang in a cheerful voice. 

Snatching the paper from Marcus's fingers the guard captain passed it to the kneeling prisoner. 'well what do you make of it?' he said through his shark like grin.

'The name is Steveo if it pleases you,  it appears we have been offered a conditional pardon. All charges dropped if we agree to accompany some fellows on a trek to a far off land'. 

Nina looked up 'what kind of trek and where to?'. 

Marcus replied 'The empire of Qulathar

Nina spat on the floor again 'Fine
 
'Chance would be a fine thing. Well Mr alchemist it appears you have your volunteers' The Capitan of the guard said while sorting through a ring of keys to unlock the prisoners bindings. Steveo and Nina were marched ahead of the captain along the dank passageway that connected the cells and up the stone steps to freedom. with Marcus following behind with the torch trying not to look in the other cells. 

At the front desk of the guard house

He watched impatiently as Steveo and Nina gathered their things. Steveo had more possessions by far, pan pipes and a satchel containing a change of clothes and money. Nina had just a small purse in addition to a bear skin cloak and a large broadsword. She passed the time waiting for Steveo by signing the release form with a crude drawing of a penis breaking the quill in the process. 

The captain left them with a bald guardsman with a dented breastplate covering his girth. He loomed large over Marcus and Steveo but saw eye to eye with Nina who when stood up was a few inches over six feet. Brandishing a length of rope the guard looked the strange party over 'do I have to tie you like livestock or are you quick learners?'. 

Steveo spoke up 'fairly quick I should say

The guard grinned revealing a mouth full of blackened and missing teeth, wishing for all the world for this whole nasty errand to be over. ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1369071630.0,,

Travant

Those... shameless bastards..

Travant tries to croak out another word but shudders and falls silent. His companion rolls him over gently on his back, and pulls the shaft clean through. Travant stifles a gasp by thrusting a fist in his mouth.

Timbers

We need to keep moving. They'll notice the captain and first mate missing from the death toll.

TRAVANT

'Aye they shall. Help me up.

Timbers gives him a hand up

TRAVANT

Where in the seven hells are our bastards? They shoulda' been there tonight.

TIMBERS

They were probably jumped as we were. The so called righteous kingdom of Tyber didn't take long to stab us in the back.

Travant spits at the mention of Tyber. His distaste for the Kingdom and orderly law apparent on his expression.

TRAVANT

I'll gut that cleric yet. The so-called high preist

Timbers glances at his captain with worry on his face. After a beat.

TIMBERS

We will yet

Heavy foot falls are heard from behind the two men as a different individual clumps down the hill the two just departed from. The figure is huge. 10 feet tall at least and massive in muscle. He bounds down the 40 foot hill in several huge steps.

TRAVANT

Well I'll be damned

Travant smiles as the huge lummox sights the two of them a lets out a joyous hoot. In a few large strides he meets up with the two of them.

Mudge

Mudge is happy to find friends. Mudge thought all his friends were dead.

The two attempt to back away but the massive orc-giant scoops the two of them up, looking around as if to make sure no one was eavesdropping, he whispers.

MUDGE

Mudge believes that our new friends were lying to us. Mudge had to kill many new friends to run away from the party. It was not his fault

Mudge looks at them pleadingly hoping they will not fault him. They finally get a good look at the Creature. His bruttish face is scarred and twisted from many fights

TRAVANT

O' trust us

TIMBERS

I split a few skulls myself.

MUDGE

So Mudge is not in trouble?

Timbers hefts his one handed boarding axe grinning. Travant clasps Mudge on the wrist.

TRAVANT

No lad

Mudge shakes his head and hoists Travant up as if he were a child. Timbers continues to stare at the hill as the sun sets.

TIMBERS

Lets get moving again. I hear there is a lake to the east. We should try and get there before morn. Did you see anyone else Mudge?

Mudge nods.

TRAVANT

Well speak up ya pack mule

MUDGE

Mudge saw Rast and his friend that does not like Mudge. They led Mudge out of battle. Told Mudge to run and then left him to go fight more. Mudge wanted to go with them! But Rast got angry at Mudge.

TIMBERS

So those two may still be alive

TRAVANT

Aye' that they are. Did they tell you anythin else?

Mudge nods again.

TRAVANT

Well ya overgrown oxen

MUDGE

Mudge... Mudge cannot remember. Mudge is sorry! But he cannot remember what he was told.

Travant and Timbers exchange glances.

TIMBERS

Well in that case we ought to continue on to the lake, and we need cover soon.

Timbers sets off east and Mudge follows behind carrying a wincing Travant in his arms. The backs of the three dissapear over another hill.

The first assumption I'll make is that writing is made up of three pillars -- Plot

For the audience to experience the deluge of emotion that comes from the characters' goal fulfillment as well as plot resolution


* Act 0 --from the David Siegel's [Nine Act structure](http://fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue%2015/websitereview.htm)

* A resolution that contains the fulfillment of the [Internal Goal](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/06/12/writing-excuses-6-2-internal-motivations/)

* The Interactivity of the elements of Plot

* Brandon Sanderson's [First Law of Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g3WLmochDMs#t=131s) -- the author's ability to satisfactorily resolve a plot point using magic is directly proportional to the reader's understanding of the magic system.

* Patricia Wrede's [Worldbuilding Questions](http://www.sfwa.org/2009/08/fantasy-worldbuilding-questions/).  A must-have for all genre writers.

**Setting**

The setting is alternate 1912

**Characters**

* Booker (the protagonist
* Elizabeth (the [relationship character](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/10/02/writing-excuses-6-18-hollywood-formula/) and occasional antagonist)
* Comstock (the main antagonist and villain)
* Fitzgerald (a character who embodies a concept and faction in the Setting and also partial antagonist)
* Rosalind and Robert Lutece (inciting incident and backstory characters).

For those who are not aware, antagonist and villain, but that's probably something for another day (since it's not a distinction that's important in this story).

**Plot**

Booker is a private investigator/contractor and sent to rescue Elizabeth from Columbia.  More elaboration below since reconstructing the Plot is our goal here.

**Starting from scratch**

If this had been me, see how everything interconnects and how it's resolved.

**Interactivity of Plot

This is where we brainstorm a bunch of ideas and weave things together.

Elizabeth (Character) has the ability to create tears in the fabric of space-time, but we can get to that later, once more details are nailed down.

Now we have the concept of the multiverse, Rosalind Lutece, who's a brilliant scientist and discovered the multiverse.  She was also responsible for the technology behind Columbia's flight.  (Character interacting with Setting and establishing backstory)

Booker, as well as place foreshadowing and other hints.  We can't do much more here, without some other details first.

Comstock is the overarching antagonist.  His image recurs throughout Columbia as a Saviour alongside jingoist American propaganda using the Founding fathers.  Shortly into Booker's arrival into Columbia

Since Columbia is a racist and classist society, though, the Fitzgerald portion of the plot serves as a vector to establish more backstory for Booker, Elizabeth and Columbia.  The development of Fitzgerald will also alter the Setting.

At this point, let's say we know the ending but for the sake of conflict, we have to tie Comstock (via the proxy of Columbia) and Booker together -- and we'll do this by intertwining their origins.  (OK, I can't cite this one or remember where I got it from.  It's the notion of never letting the characters walk away.  In James Frey's How to Write a Damn Good Novel, it's the concept of the two sides of the conflict being inseparable until the plot resolution).

There's a split in the multiverse where Booker became Comstock but in others, became infertile and decided to steal a baby.  They reach into another universe, Walter Bishop-style, and steal Comstock's baby, where he was still Booker (albeit drunk and heavily in debt).  This baby grows up to become Elizabeth.  At the outset of the story, the reality is that our Booker is sent into a Comstock universe by the Lutece Twins to make things right again (123rd attempt).  All of this information will form the final twist at the end of the story.

Since we now know how we want to end, of the relevant information in the Fitzgerald section.  We find out that Elizabeth's ability creates realities and that people can move between them.   We find out that exposure to these tears prematurely ages characters and renders them infertile ([Magic system must have a cost](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/05/18/writing-excuses-episode-15-costs-and-ramifications-of-magic/)).  Now, we have two concepts which we can go back and apply to our characters and backstory.

**Fleshing out backstory**

Backstory (Act zero) drives the entire story.  What is defined in the backstory makes the resolution of the story inevitable

In regular notions of the multiverse

We already have a genius,  ie. if Rosalind discovered the multiverse, then it would make sense that she would encounter another version of herself as Robert.  This adds a dialog counterpoint for Rosalind.  Through flashbacks, we can establish that the Lutece Twins were the ones who sent Booker to Columbia, in an effort to right their own wrongs (being involved in Elizabeth/Anna's kidnapping in the first place).  We can place the Lutece Twins throughout the story, adding questions for the audience/player and a sense of mystery regarding their identity and motivations that is solved in the final act.

Comstock

There's a bunch more backstory but we can start putting all of this into a narrative structure.

**Nine Act Structure**

I'm only taking a guess that this structure was used but Infinite also fits nicely into the Hollywood 4 Act structure.  I removed the descriptions of each Act to fit into the posting limit

Here we go:

Act Zero (flashback and forces in motion) - *Voxaphones and the pivotal scenes from this portion are shown in the final act/denouement*.

Act One (establishing shots) - *Booker's entry into Columbia

Act Two (hook and conflict) - *From the moment of throwing the ball either at the interracial couple or the announcer

Act Three (introduction to characters and plot dev) - *Seeing the underside of Columbia, and of course, meeting Elizabeth*.

Act Four (committing to first goal) - *Booker commits to getting Elizabeth to the Airship

Act Five (the wrong goal) - *This is the Slate and Fitzgerald portion of the game

Act Six (the new goal) - *Booker and Elizabeth head to Comstock House.*

Act Seven (all does not go well) - *Elizabeth is captured but Booker rescues her.  The extent of her tearing ability is shown.  They take over the Airship and destroy the Monument*

Act Eight (the end)  - *After the destruction of the Monument, external goal (the onscreen task is getting drowned by Elizabeth at the point where the multiverse splits into versions that have Comstock) and defeating the antagonist (stopping Comstock's origins).  All of this is made possible because we now understand the nature of the multiverse Setting and the abilities of Elizabeth and the Lutece twins (Sanderson's First Law of Magic)*

Now that the backbone is established

eg. red herrings about Booker's mantra ""paying off the debt"".  At first blush

I'd also add in the Lutece Twin appearances at this point

**Some final notes**

I've skimmed over the techniques used to inject all of the required information without info-dumping.  There are already a lot of resources on that available

On the surface

* Comstock was at Wounded Knee but Slate was sure that he wasn't.  Booker

* Comstock is seemingly attempting to rewrite history.  This plays into the concept of his rewriting the history of Elizabeth.

Another example is the Fitzgerald section.  An incredible amount of exposition into the nature of Elizabeth's power, it's all done to the background of Fitzgerald's storyline playing out and changing the nature of the Setting.

The other aspect that can't be overemphasised is the quality of the presentation, particularly the ending.  For our medium, this means we need the prose to do all the heavy lifting.  Easier said than done, I know, but all the planning in the world for the greatest story in the world can be undone by bad prose.

I hope this helps some of you and shows some of the processes that I find useful in making a stronger story.  Here are a few more links on endings:

Growing up, the threat of violence and fear would put most people on his side, except for Konrad. Gunth thought he knew everything you could possibly want to know back then. He was the strong one who spoke with violence, sharpened steel, with a passion for fighting, be it man to man, army to army
 
 Konrad, but he heard it often enough from the women in town.  Everyone thought Gunth was the leader, but it was always Konrad, guiding, suggesting, or demanding if necessary, knowing what lever to pull and button to push, the only thing he ever learned to read, and he knew what needed to be done.

   Not any more thought Gunth. Not since they killed him.

“All rise for the Lord of Halteen”

The great hall was filled with the sound of clothes rustling as an ageing Lord Oldash walked toward his marble throne, spoke “Todays court is now in session.”

“Rise commander.” Spoke the one eyed Lord.

“I have located and captured the native girl my lord

“You have done well commander

“Thank you my lord

“What is it farmer?” he asked.

“M’lord

“No m’lord, shrieking an awful shriek.”

A ripple of pretentious laughter flowed through the hall

“It’s real damn it!” he shouted. “And if I’m to be laughed at for trying to do my bit for this city then to hell with you all, muttering profanities under his breath. One of the knights stepped forward to punish the farmer for his insolence.

“Let him go Sir Erick

“Right!” Shouted Oldash. “Does anyone else wish to entertain the court with daft tales of beasts of burden stalking the shadows or can I return to my maidens?”

Denlith leaned toward Oldash. “We have three criminals awaiting sentences

“Fine

The doors to the hall opened and three bound men were escorted in, the third a native whose presence sparked mutterings of slander between the nobles, he and Rothyss shared an electric stare as he passed. Denlith handed Oldash parchment with details of the criminals, which he looked at with subtle disinterest before turning his attention to the accused.

“Fallion Skyhawk.”

Fallion promptly stepped forward. “Lord” he mumbled.

“You say milord when you address your better! Learning a bit of respect might have had you end up in a better position than the one you’re in now” Oldash spat. “You’ve been accused of stealing jewellery from the house of noble Sir Burf. Have you anything to say in your defence?”

Fallion paused and took a look around the hall before replying. “Milord"" He said with the slightest hint of sarcasm. ""Noble Sir Burf has so much jewellery, I made sure to only take the rings that do not fit on his fat fingers anymore.” 

Oldash jumped from his throne “You insolent little shit!” he barked. “You could have walked out of here after having lashes and losing a hand but no

Fallion forced a smile as he was walked out of the hall

“Dynn Redhand.”

An old man came forward. “Milord.” he said.

“It says here that you have chosen to forsake our saviour and poison my people with the heretic lies of the God of shadows

“That’s true my lord

“Tell that to Calphanaax when you meet him after you rot in the dungeons

“A smart-arse thief, savage? Do you even have a name?”

“My name is Aenna.” He spoke.

“Humph

Unfazed, more sophisticated traditions than your mistranslated fairytales.”

“Bloody savages dancing in the mud is what you call sophisticated.” Oldash quickly dismissed. “Now what were you doing outside my city

Aenna said nothing.

I've been printing out pages and giving them to my wife for her to read through and edit as I finish my edits. She has already gone through the first 16 pages and marked them up like she was a high school English teacher. Which is good because I know I didn't catch everything. One this round of edits is done we will lather

I've always loved reading fantasy novels ever since I was a child and have always wanted to actually sit down and write one of my own. This winter I finally sat about to do it and completed my novel
Necromancer: The corruption revolves around the tale of a young elf named Fayne who is set in the book to take the trial of becoming a Keeper of the Equinox. A defender of nature and of his home town Fen'dril. But during his trials his home town is besieged by a necromatic force and his lover is killed.
Fayne is left with one option, but puts his soul on the edge of corruption.

1325130826.0,nuheb,This may be your chance. New collaborative publisher is seeking proposals/queries for fantasy novels. [X-posted from r/fantasy by request],CreativityTheorist,12,3,5,"(See [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/nt2ui) For some questions already answered.)

Last winter

[Indie Ink](http://indieinkpublishing.com/presta) is trying to straddle the growing divide between traditional publishing and self-publishing. The traditional guys pay all the publishing costs in exchange for a thin royalty (5-10%), title, marketing, etc.

The self publishers are at the other end of the spectrum, and upsell you on other services like distribution, marketing etc. They can't lose, and you take all the risk.

Indie Ink is trying to balance this equation. Like a traditional publisher, and they put a lot of money into the production, distribution and marketing side of things. But unlike the traditional guys, Indie thinks book projects work best when both parties have equal skin in the game. So their deal is that the costs should get split between the author and the publisher. And so should the royalties. They aim for a 50/50 split on both, although in practice, projects can end up anywhere between 40/60 and 60/40 once the negotiating dust has settled.

My novel ([Strange Places](http://indieinkpublishing.com/presta/5-fiction)) was Indie's first title in the fiction market - a market they now want to grow beyond just my work. So

That's where you guys come in.

I know there are a bunch of you out there with finished, we'd love to see a proposal. We're looking for something new. Something that isn't elves and dwarves, or sparkly vampires, or teen-romance with were-beasts. Remember what fantasy *used* to mean? Fantastical? That's what we're looking for. Hit us with something fantastic.

To do so, we'll ask for that kind of stuff later. Tell us about your story and about yourself as a writer. Make us salivate to see the actual manuscript. And do it in no more than about 600 words.

Let's show the old-school publishers that there's a better way to do this - a way where the authors are treated like business partners instead of children - where everybody gets a say in the product that goes out

Chapter 1

I awoke with a groan as the community alarm clock went off. I was a light sleeper unlike most of the other girls


Every girl is given a big plastic tub when they arrive at Danubey's all girls boarding school


The showers are really just a big room with ten shower heads, so I don't get bugged about my body, especially about my scars. 


My scars are from my childhood

My parents absolutely despised me. I was three when the target practice started. They would throw empty bottles at me
    
I was  when my father would hit me in a drunken rage. Slap me across the face

 I turned on the shower and let the cold water wash away the bad memories. But no matter how cold the water was they were etched in my brain for life. I finished my shower quickly, short and petite with long dirty blonde hair. 

I averted my eyes and headed towards the exit of the showers. ""Not so fast Tin."" She caught the neckline of my bathrobe and pulled me back in front of her. I looked her in the eye and scowled.

  ""It's Tyne. Like time but with an 'N' sound."" I scowled deeper. 
 
  ""Looks like your in a hurry. Don't want to be seen nude? Have something to hide? Tattoos? Piercing? You can get expelled for things like that you know."" 

 ""You'd like that wouldn't you?"" I smiled and looked her in the eyes. ""Daddy would take away your allowance if he found out about that butterfly wouldn't he?"" The look in her eyes was priceless. She shouldn't be so surprised that I knew
     
 But of course no one would report her. Her dad practically owned the school, Mindy!"" And with that, I left. 

~~~~~~

Breakfast was the usual. I sat at my table, I was just bored. I had read all the good books in the library and all the ones in my personal stash 2 or 3 times already. I should go into the bookstore in town and get more sometime soon. 

 I absentmindedly took a bite of my cream cheese bagel and went back to reading about evolution and Charles Darwin when a shadow loomed over my table. I looked up into the face of Mrs. Wichel

""You are to report to my office after your classes."" She scowled and then added ""you will have a visitor."" After she scowled at me some more she turned around and walked away to bark at another unfortunate girl.

*Who would visit me?* I wondered. I didn't have any family left

  In my state of befuddlement I didn't notice Mindy come up to my table. I jumped as she sat down with a thud. She glared at me before asking

 ""I'm bored. I have no one to converse with in this miserable school and I've read all the books."" 

 ""Nerd.""
     
""Thanks. What do you want? I know you didn't come here just to insult me. You could do that in geography.""

""That biology test. I totally didn't study and daddy says he's going to take my phone away if I don't pass it.""

 ""And?"" 

  ""You have it next. I need you to write down the answers and give them to me.""

 ""You mean cheat? No thanks."" I got up to throw away my paper plate and napkin

 ""What do you want?"" She pleaded

 ""Nothing you can give me."" I gathered my stuff and headed off to biology.


Chapter 2


I breezed through the test, thinking someone threw a paper airplane at me and discovered it was a blue jay. It looked at me with black eyes and cocked its head. It must have got in through the open window.

 ""Mr. Dex, which was still stating intently at me. 

""You can handle it Natalie

I was sure everyone was staring at me now. It's okay I thought at the bird as I started towards the open window. It chirped and turned its heat towards me, then flew away.

I turned back and sat down in my seat

~~~~~~

 The rest of the day passed by normally, and long straight brown hair, down to the middle of her back. She was a head shorter than me, but of course everyone was shorter than me. 

When I walked in she stood up and smiled at me. She looked genuinely happy to see me. ""Hi! I'm Samantha! Are you Natalie?"" She looked me up and down and smiled at me bigger. When I nodded she exclaimed ""great!"" And took my hand and led me out the door and up the stairs to the beds. 

 I dug my heels in the carpet out side the door. ""Woah

""Don't you know? I'm taking you out of this school and to a new one! A better one! One meant for our kind."" She looked at me

 ""What do mean 'our kind'? Who are you?"" She stopped smiling and stared at a point behind me.

 ""Looks like we'll be staying for dinner. I have some explaining to do.""

The man claims to be an escaped slave, straight from the mines of the Sadurvag, and he brings a warning.  The Tarmuri-Tir Gahgraa is active once more, and its army of demonic Kagling warriors, is heading an invasion into the very heart of Deldar.  When all hope seems lost

And here is a 2-page excerpt from Part One:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1svuHTRclMfwUaODuPsAm4tZOrar3vARXkl93q89aCj4/edit

I hope you enjoy it and would like to read more.  If you guys like it enough I will post a second excerpt soon.  Please leave feedback in the comments

Edit: I've had some complaints that there are too many unfamiliar names in the excerpt.  That's my fault

If it helps

Caalen - new Second Commander (high ranking military captain).

Deldar - the 'Gondor' country.

Gungen Khil - a badlands-style hill country north of Deldar.

Fortress of... - a border fortress that serves as a forewarning against a Sadurvag invasion.

Daemod - a fugitive who appears at their fort (called he-who-had-been-Daemod since he's so bedraggled).

Kiomad - another Second Commaner.

Sadurvag - several races of demonic creatures that frequently attack regions where humans live.

Kaglings - a breed of Sadurvag comparable to goblins or gnomes.

Lannacyndri - 'Cyndri' is the name of the world, as in Central Cyndri.

Vannalinn - essentially a deity of light.

Vanndar Heliagir - a cultural hero like Achilles.

Anagond - a reference to a battle won against the Sadurvag.

Tarmuri-Tir Gahgraa - as far as the characters know

Iunda - Caalen's horse.

I hope that helps a bit.  Sorry about all that

1370541828.0,1fszvi,[Critique] My first attempt at writing in over 15 years: The Bitten,danger_boogie,8,1,7,"I came across this weekly Flash Fiction challenge at TerribleMinds and thought it was a great way to get back into writing. I would love any critiques that you have to offer. 

**The Bitten**

The sun languishes slowly over the old farmhouse, but the night ahead is foreboding.  

It wasn’t always this way. Before The Bites most people paid no attention to the cycles of the moon. Even in the beginning, the link became clear. 

The Swarms always come during the New Moon. Hundreds of thousands of scorpions overrun towns, devouring anyone in their path. The first Swarm caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Some were fortunate enough to escape with only a few bites, but after a couple of days the fever took hold. The Bitten, as they came to be known, began showing signs of sickness 48 hours after being wounded by the insects. Their temperature rose to near-fatal highs and then the hallucinations started. Hospital wards were full of patients screaming at the top of their lungs, and though their words were unintelligible, were absolutely terrifying nonetheless. 


Then one night all was still. The fever was gone, family, friends, neighbours, anyone who knew someone who had been sick joined together in the search. Media outlets quickly picked up the story and the world spent the entire day in a panic. Where did these people go? Would they come back? Are they dangerous? Millions of questions without answers – at least for another few hours anyway. 


That night the Full Moon shone brightly in the sky.  Already on edge from the events of the past few weeks people locked their doors and windows, everyone heard the wailing begin. It started as a low moaning and quickly worked it’s way up into an ear-piercing cry, one that made fingernails on a chalkboard sound like a lullaby. Just when you thought you couldn’t take it anymore, that the screaming would make your ears bleed, the wailing stopped.  And then they attacked. 


The scorpions were different this time. Most noticeably they were huge, and some were still wearing their hospital gown. 


They came in droves, devouring every living thing they came across. Once they got in there was no escape. People tried to fight them off with anything they could – few were successful. Those that were, found the only way to stop these monsters was with a couple of bullets to the brain. The Bitten would lie twitching on the floor, green sticky blood oozing from the holes in their head – and then they would vanish. 


The lucky people, the way the air envelopes you on a hot and sticky day.  


Some of us worked together. We formed groups and societies with the common goal of staying alive. We were ready during the next New Moon. The scorpions swarmed but many less were Bitten – though we still lost far too many. And we were ready during the next Full Moon, more effective tactics. And with every cycle there is less and less of us. 


It has been 7 months since the first Swarm and humanity has not fared well. It is estimated that only one twentieth of the world’s population remains Unbitten. We spend our days looking for answers, putting them in cells, but they always vanish. And so we look to the sky. Wondering why the Moon sent the scorpions, nervously awaiting the next attack.


And now it is time to batten down the hatches, and the wailing is about to begin.

Colors swam over his vision, and payment was due.

Half his skull had been shattered by the red knight wielding his awful mace. He somehow retained consciousness as he had fallen from his own steed to land beneath stomping hoofs and fighting men. He had lain there, but this piece of blood soaked ground had already been claimed. Its true victor waited for one more soul to pass into its grasp.

He closed his eyes, the involuntary twitches that wracked his body. Death did not come though, and had it, it would not have been so merciful.

He had lived a hard life. A mercenary’s life. He had killed innocents and vented his rage and lusts on the victims of his warfare. The gods

The crow looked down on him with an intelligence one only thinks capable of men. A new fear welled up inside him. He wished to flail his arms to shoo the little beast away, plucked his left eye out with its beak. The man watched in stunned horror with his remaining eye as the thing tilted its thick black neck back. It opened its beak and scoffed down its morsel. A savage urge of delight welled up in the man, mixing with his already present anguish and horror as it choked on its prize. It only lasted a moment and a deep feeling of loss replaced delight as the creature managed to get its meal down. It cocked its head at him, stepped forward again and plucked out the other eye.

The man tried to scream, and then a roar. The air about him stank of carrion and a rhythmic wind pattered his face, drying to his cheeks the blood that dripped from his empty sockets. The man now knew fear. This was his payment; to be eaten alive. How he wished he had been luckier.

Had he not blocked most of the red knight’s furious assault

“Mortal man” the murder said. “You can hear us mortal man?” It asked of him.

The man gurgled, “yes.”

The murder responded

The man cried

The murder said

The man just sobbed in self pity.

Fear jolted the man again. The thought of a god consuming him was a horrible one. “I will obey”

Here's what I posted:

&gt; * **Conflict/Problem:** Medical Issue

&gt; * **Setting to Include:** A government office

&gt; * **Character:** A deadly former lab assistant.

&gt; * **Character:** A solitary recently-retired graphic designer.

&gt; Let's set this in a fantasy setting

&gt; Our former lab assistant is deadly - okay, or traits that makes her unpleasant to be around. Maybe an alchemical experiment went wrong, and now she's a mutant, with poisonous fingernails. But she still owes taxes, because it's a head tax. But she can't find a lab job, because she's dangerous to be around.

&gt; Our graphic designer obviously wasn't using InDesign in the pseudo-middle-ages

&gt; The conflict is a medical issue

&gt; Ah

&gt; Okay. The tax collector will let the lab assistant slide on her taxes, is an affront against Gods and man, and she has to be taken out, and taken out in a stealthy fashion. (But really, and the Deadly Assistant doesn't know this, the collector had tried to force himself on the heraldry designer, but then she saw that the tax collector had a mutant twin growing out of his side, and is threatening to expose his demon familiar to all and sundry.)

&gt; But the heraldry designer is a good friend of the Deadly Assistant's--a former lover, the tax bill will send her to debtor's prison... and the Assessor's no fool; he's left documents that will damn her and make sure her entire family is put into debtor's prison if she just kills him...

&gt; So we have:

&gt; * Character: Deadly Lab Assistant.

&gt; * Situation: Faced with debtor's prison if she doesn't comply

&gt; * Goal: Get out of this situation and back to normal life.

&gt; * Opposition: The tax assessor opposes her resuming her normal life. The lover opposes dying.


So here's what I think would be fun. Given this starting point, I'll create a Google Doc and send the participants the link. And when we all agree it's done then we can submit it to some market as ""by /r/fantasywriters"" and when we get our tiny little check we buy the mods some reddit gold. And if we get a good check we buy the mods some reddit gold and split the rest. And if we sell the movie rights for a million billion dollars we buy the mods some reddit gold, the rest of /r/fantasywriters some (root)beer, and THEN we split the rest. :)

This work is copyrighted 2013 by Nathan Washor. All rights reserved.

My [website](http://zarathuz.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/old-friends/)

Aban’s considerable bulk was masked by the narrow alley’s shadows. He lowered his head to the ground to study the ruined metal grate. Its thick iron bars looked as though they had been cut by something very hot. Their melted tips protruded about an inch creating a large hole through which almost anyone could pass. Aban rubbed a tentacle over a severed prong and held up a glass vial with a tiny jellyfish bobbing within. He gave the flask two quick shakes. In response the creature lit up with a bright blue glow. Under the expelled light Aban looked at his tentacle inspecting for rust. He found none

He landed in a crouch

There was only one way to go. He clutched the jelly lamp high with one of his tentacles. Its light extended far illuminating a long tubular corridor. Aban waddled forward

Before approaching the intersection, he heard a clatter of metal on stone followed by two cries of surprise. He withdrew his kukris holding one in each hand and turned the corner to confront the commotion.

Two human men, seeing struggle was pointless, nearly slammed into Aban’s form as he turned to abandon his friend. His metal oil lantern clanged on the floor and almost went out after being dropped in shock. Another lantern lay snuffed next to the serpent’s body. Two blurs of Aban’s kukris were nearly invisible as they separated chunks of the snake from the trapped man’s torso.

“Another t-t-toad.” The reeling man stuttered as he looked up in horror at Aban.

“I,” Aban wheezed from the sudden exertion. After a few more breaths, his breathing steadied. He said, “I am a negroil. I am here looking. Looking for another. Another like me. You said *another*. You have seen another? Tell me. How long ago? Where?” Aban’s stare held the man fixed in place. The coward seemed to lose all senses, able to reply only in stammers. Aban snapped his mouth open and shut and croaked, “Listen! Answer me. Time is short.”

The man, “Yes, this, this morning. I, we saw it, him, she.” The man seemed to falter, the man continued

“My name… Aban. Continue please. *Where* was he?” Aban asked in a grating croak.

The other man, we see’d him. Yes, we did. We see’d him this morning, yes we did. Aaron and I see’d him near the slum pits we did sir. We can take you there sir. Take you there sir, we go. Come sir, follow Jarek, we take you, grabbed and re-lit his lantern with the twist of a switch

Aban followed the pair along winding corridors and down steep stairways until Jarek grabbed Aaron by the shoulder and hissed

Only a stairway back

Jarek said, it is.” Then Jarek screamed as Aaron’s head toppled forward.

Aban croaked, sighed sadly and hopped onward.

Aban turned a corner. An intense heat washed over him from the mouth of a cavern less than a stone’s throw away while the howling wind he’d been following sucked him onward. An ancient stone bridge crossed a dark lake connecting the tunnel to an island. At its center a great column of fire was devouring a huge pile of refuse. The flame’s light reflected off still waters illuminating giant stalactites poised overhead as if aiming to bring down the whole cave’s weight on those within. The city’s trash was collected and incinerated here

All five of Sindar’s tentacles were raised in the air tracing patterns of command as he stared upwards

Aban drew shadows about himself, but as he landed the stones beneath his bulk screamed in protest. Together, they fell away into the waters below.

Surfacing, old friend! There is no sense denying. I know it is you who joined me here. Only one so fat as you could have smashed through those stones I weakened so cleanly.” He chuckled and added, “You took down half the bridge, Aban! And besides, I’ve known you’ve been following me for quite some time, old friend.”

Old friend. Indeed the two were old friends

His high pitched croak sounded almost sickly. With sucking shallow breaths Aban responded as the illusory magic he commanded threw his voice in all directions. “Oh Sindar. You have fallen so far. Yes. My body is fat. My movements slow. My voice winded. But don’t underestimate. My spirit. Or my body. They are powerful. I regret. Regret I could not spare. Spare you the knowledge. The knowledge of your impending death. I wished you that last mercy.” He eyed Sindar from the concealing depths.

A chortling croak erupted from Sindar’s thick lips. “Aban

Aban cut him off. “Show me Sindar? Tell me lies? Feed me poison? Throw my flesh to Yrdel? Like you did to Khalil? No. Old friend. You know why. Why I have tracked you. Tracked across nations.” Aban dove beneath the surface. An enraged Sindar bent the column of fire over on itself to churn and burn the waters where he had been hiding only moments earlier.

Aban’s massive legs kicked as his powerful arms pulled. The giant webs on both thrust him far from the hellish cauldron that section of the lake had become. Sindar’s fury was relentless. He cast the flame across the waters all around the island. The bowed jet carved furrows into the surface leaving a boiling wake as it passed. If Sindar were allowed to keep torching the water

Aban swam deep below the passing flame. He came up silently and quickly swam to the island’s shore. The ripples would give away his location

Something warned Sindar of his presence. He whipped around, charring bone. Aban spasmed. The artifact fell free of his hand to fall useless at Sindar’s feet as agony racked his body.

Sindar shuffled back in shock. He looked down at the blade. Crafted of violentium, searching through the pile of refuse, for something.

* * *

Aban awoke. He was shackled in chains. His leg throbbed, but saw nothing more than shadowy outlines. A small square room, a shallow puddle of water pooled in the low corner. No, not water. Ordure and urine by the rank smell of it. The pain was too much. He blacked out.

“Wake friend. We have some questions for you.” The velvety voice lulled him from his fevered dreams. A torch now sputtered in the far corner by the room’s only entry

Aban’s body agonized, finally understanding his situation. He had failed. Sindar was gone and now he lay in some rank dungeon beneath the Rhokian capital city of Krasnyi. Worse, the labyrinthine tattoos snaking over the hooded man’s exposed hands marked him as a seer – the bane of his own order, the illusionists.

The seer said, and all of it. From when he and Sindar were children to the day his masters tasked him to track and slay the renegade negroil. Aban knew this was sorcery tugging at him, imploring the truth free itself from his mouth, but there was nothing he could do. Resistance was hopeless. He was trapped, bound, and unable to control his umbra. He had no defense save his own willpower and that was so weak. The honeyed words worked their magic.

THE MILDLY INTERESTING ADVENTURES OF BOB'N'BETS.

Six feet meandered along a winding dirt path. The feet had no exact destination, the better it would be for all of them. But until then, they had to survive the hardships, the trials and the heartbreak of being away from their friend...
...and alone together.

“You stinky bitch... you just farted perfectly upwind from me on purpose
Robert saw a small pebble and kicked it towards Betsy
He sighed and continued on after Betsy. This was always the way. Although neither party had the slightest notion where they were headed
Time passed as Robert and Betsy ambled along the dirt path until it rose to the crest of a hill. In the distance
“Lengthy Timber?!” exclaimed Robert, what with being colour blind and all.)The two looked at each other and then again at the sign. It really was shabby. Age had caused the paint to curl from the wood, which was white with age. Two empty hooks underneath the sign seemed lonely with no extra signage to hold.  Despite a totally ridiculous name, it seemed that the spot would be ideal to rest their weary feet and paws.



Upon entering the village, followed the wanderers with their almost fearful eyes.
“Take a picture it lasts longer” snapped Robert.
One of the women reached into her grocery bag without breaking eye contact and obliged
“Come on” grumbled the bested Robert as he walked further through the town. He soaked in his surroundings noticing an antiques shop, and a very creepy religious statue on the other. He stopped walking and looked around, trying to decide if the man he was trying to find might have stopped here, or if he, like Robert himself was thinking, got the heck out of dodge. 
Before Robert could make any decision at all
“Jeff Johnson Head! I am so please you came to visit our wonderful little town! Would you like a tour?! It is such a great place I think you should come on the tour! Come on right this way!” 
The man had a smile taking up the entire bottom half of his head, coupled with the fact that he was still shaking his hand, unnerved Robert.
“We’re fine. We both would much rather... um... explore this village on our own terms
“We?! Are you here with a friend!?”
“Not really. She’s more of a pest.”
“Oooohhh! The wife is in the shops eh?!” assumed Jeff.
“Nope. Not married. Betsy is –“
“Say no more! Girlfriend! Almost worse than a wife
Jeff doubled over with laughter, sexist, and just unfunny.)Robert was getting annoyed. 
	“I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m spoken for. Betsy
This seemed to grab Jeff’s attention. He stood bolt upright, to the space beside his feet where a dog normally would be. There she was. She was panting, her long pink tongue barely concealing razor sharp teeth, dripping with venom. Although he couldn’t see them, Jeff was petrified of annoying the dog enough for her to unleash her stingers, hidden in her ears and tail.  (Jeff’s knowledge of dog, or even mammal biology
“Well um... haha! That’s ah... ha! Unusual! Well
Betsy scratched at Robert’s leg. She wanted to get out of the village
“I think we’ll give it a miss... Sorry erm... Jeff Dick Hea-“
“Johnson! Jeff Johnson Head! I’m afraid I’ll have to insist chum! I really feel that it is my duty to introduce all visitors to the town! It’s the least I can do!” he countered, or because he had just noticed that the whole village was watching them from their windows.
“Okay then... let’s go I suppose” 

Jeff had started the tour by crossing the street to a small pub.
“The pub we are approaching is known locally as ‘Stoney’s’! It has been passed from father to son for decades, to Pebbles! Pebbles doesn’t have a son but we all hope that his daughter Sandy will take over and...Erm... sorry my friend but all buildings in this town have a strict ‘No Canine’ rule!” They had reached Stoney’s door, and Jeff was holding it ajar. Jeff turned his gaze to Betsy with a look of disgust and a slight hint of fear. Betsy cocked an ear and eyebrow and glanced at Robert as if to say “If you leave me outside I will make you regret it.” Robert, still regretting the last time he left her outside , (He left her outside while he ran into a hospital to use the bathroom. Having been gone all of 15 seconds, the revenge had been going on for the last 15 years.) pleaded Betsy’s case on her behalf.
	“She’ll be grand! There’s no harm in her at all
“I don’t think so; we have a very very strict ‘No Canines’ rule as I’ve already said!”
“But I can assure you that anything you worry about her doing will not happen.”
	The two men continued this back and forth
It was dark, discussing the weather of the day. A large moustache with a man hiding behind it was working at the bar. He was a rock of a man, rubbing a dirty glass with an even dirtier rag. Betsy trotted to a small stool, hopped onto it, from there a table, a higher stool and finally the bar itself. Knowing that the barman didn’t speak Dog, she panted heavily and gave a huge grin
	The barman’s dirty rag stopped cleaning the glass  with surprise. His eyes opened slowly to see a clawed
	Totally misreading the situation

	Outside
	“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She never has
“Do you have documentation to prove such a statement?!”
Robert wasn’t a violent man. He didn’t have a temper, had he hit a person for any reason .( Before his travels, Ger, Robert’s brother, was trying to learn the drums. Robert snapped, ran upstairs, and created “Cullentra Drumming”, he just used a person to hit something. ) He was

1367337198.0,1df0mf,In the floating city of Sanctum [WIP],SevenStonePlace,9,1,0,"I have a campaign world I've been working on for about a decade and am finally have enough to seriously sit and down work on the sourcebook. I want to include small vignettes throughout. I'd love a critique of my style and if reading this makes the world as interesting to the reader as it is to me. 

This vignette would be given more context by its placement in the sourcebook, holy city of Sanctum, and the country Jaak'Xol below... Enjoy! :)

IN THE FLOATING CITY OF SANTUM

""Brother Darvis! Brother Darvis!"" a young boy's voice called into the courtyard, he rushed past the vibrant flowers and thick greenery to a small, open air stadium where the strongest and most fearless of the priests honed themselves for battle. Often the boy had spent hours in the simple stone stands, watching the clergymen engage each other. Dark, strong men from Jaak'xol stood watching, their chests, arms and faces ritually tattooed, blonde-haired Brother Darvis McDade

The messenger boy rushed down the stairs two at a time and skidded to a halt at the edge of the stadium floor, as the others laughed and cheered, making friendly jests at their kin.  ""Jus' keep practicin', Tal'ock. You'll get me one day,"" Brother Darvis said, his Malineeran accent thick.  

""Brother Darvis!"" the boy cried out. ""I have a summons for you from Cardinal Gailynd! He says it's really important! You have to hurry.""
""A'right,"" he said as he quickly splashed his sweaty face and hair with cool water and snatched up his robes from the stands. Jacob could plainly see the expansive, stylized sun tattoo that covered Brother Darvis' back, as well as the terrible scar that ran across his ribs and to his stomach. It was that jagged, black scar that gave the priest what notoriety he had, for few men have ever survived an attack from one of the Tainted, the ravenous walking dead. Jacob was so curious to hear the story, but he dared not ask the priest. He knew it was a tale Brother Darvis rarely told. Most felt certain it was simply not the kind of day any person would ever want to relive. Jacob watched as Brother Darvis jogged out of the stadium and out into the bustling streets of the Holy City of Sanctum.  



Cardinal Gailynd paced back and forth by the tall windows that lined his study. Their stained glass told the story of the terrible war that once threatened humanity and how Luminarus' love for his children pulled the city of Sanctum from the earth and set it to move through the heavens. That was thousands of years ago, the downtrodden, the injured and oppressed still came to its streets, but Cardinal Gailynd knew that his lifetime had been one of peace compared to the dark times the world had seen in the past. The Great Temple was more likely to bring to the city the impoverished, the hungry. This was bittersweet to the Cardinal - though humanity did not have to face the terrible ravages of war, they had been beset upon by another enemy: each other. Cruel despots and tyrants, the greed of petty lords

""Without a common enemy,"" he whispered to himself as he looked to the young, fresh-faced priest who knelt in fervent prayer beside the Cardinal's small shrine to their god. The young man's dark hair was beaded with sweat, his face pale and sallow, not with hunger or disease, but with shock and a creeping madness.  

The door to his chamber opened and Brother Darvis

""You summon'd me, but he would not be pulled from his prayers, would not even open his eyes.  

""There is nothing wrong with his health, ""It was a priest of Remelphon. Eli believes that he is divinely cursed.""

Darvis' eyes burned for a moment. But he stood and said calmly

""A Baghian wedding boat in Salinas. Brother Eli was to preside, but stopped.  

""Cardinal Gailynd

""We don't know. Even as we speak they are preparing the temple and calling some of the other cardinals. We will do all we can,"" the cardinal said as he laid his hand on Eli's shaking, bowed head. ""We will do all we can, Brother Darvis. But go now. His acolyte, Liam, is still in Salinas.""

Darvis ran as fast as he could to collect what he needed and make his way to the Great Temple. Damned priests of Remelphon! he thought. What person can take such pleasure in making another's life worse? Not even the mercy of a quick death, and sparing not even a moment to glimpse the splendor of this place, he knelt before the altar and prayed softly in his native tongue.  

""Justicar of the First Torch, so that I may keep them safe from the lies and trickery of your nephew, Remelphon, and his servants, and preside over the blessed union of marriage. Let me be a light unto the world, through your grace and through your mercy...""
A flare of brilliant light consumed the priest in Sanctum and filled

""... until the day no darkness is left."" Brother Darvis opened his eyes and found around him the simple temple

The accusation whispered through the narrow streets of the town.  It fluttered through open windows and slipped between the cracks in closed doors
Yet even though no wind carried it and all rain washed it away

The procession carrying the accused witch announced itself well in advance of appearing.  The huge timber wheels of the massive caged prison wagon threw up great clouds of dust as they rumbled along the dry dirt roads.  Four templars, sat beside the driver of the prison wagon.  Another four, also armed with spears, rode behind the prison wagon.  A single man, dressed in a black cloak and a wide brimmed hat shadowing his face, rode alone beside the procession.  He rode alone on a grey horse, cantering from the group of templars in front to those behind and then sometime riding alone.  He never stayed long with any of the groups of templars and he did not speak to them.  They did not take any notice of him, but turned as his eyes flickered from side to side

The cage of the prison wagon had been covered with thin white cloth.  The symbols of the Order had been sewn onto the cloth, could be seen within the cage lurching and snarling its way around like an animal, rushing at the bars before cowering away towards the centre of the cage.  The cloaked man rode beside the wagon from time to time, his eyes focused on the figure.

In each village, each forming the sign of protection with their fingers over themselves or their family.  Their eyes were fixed on the cage, almost as if they were not able to shift them, even had they wanted to.  Once the procession had pressed on, the silence was destroyed, like a balloon that had been popped and the small crowds expressed loudly to each other those theories that they had kept to themselves while the procession was in sight.

It would be generous in the extreme to describe the cluster of ramshackle dwellings that the procession stopped at for the night as a village.  They were gathered haphazardly around a tiny shrine to Tine and beside an old wooden bridge which spanned a wide rushing river.  The dry timbers of the bridge groaned worryingly as the prison wagon lumbered over it.  Its entire population was gathered around the then shrine.  In front of them an old stooped priest in red robes protected the people with his shadow.  There was a large common area between the houses and the river.

The group of templars in front stopped and looked back to the cloaked man for confirmation.  He nodded and then spurred his horse so that he was standing in front of the priest.  

“We are proud to welcome the Order of the Righteous to our village

“The young woman that we escort stands accused of the most vile and evil of all witchcraft, to plead with you, to corrupt you into helping her escape.  Her words will be like honey, sweet but sticky.  If you aid her then you are as guilty as she is and will be hunted down and brought to justice by the Templars of the Order of the Righteous.  May Tine protect us all.”  He did not wait for a reply but turned back to the templars.

They had ignored the villagers completely and were making camp in the open ground.  The horses were stripped of their saddles and led to the water to drink before being hobbled close to the prison wagon.  The driver took the wagon horse to the water himself

Once the horses had been cared for, statue-like.  One of the templars filled a bucket with water and brought it into her prison for her.  

They refused the offer of food from the village
The cloaked man ate alone, the driver walked down and sat down beside the cloaked man.  The cloaked man was staring into the water, his hat in his hand.

“Another day and we will be in Alsongburg

“If they try and free her

By the time the last flickers of light had disappeared, their shield held close to their bodies and their helmets on.  Their eyes were downcast, their heads were bent in prayer, their lips moving soundlessly.

No moon or stars rose to replace the sun.  The light from the fire flickered and darted into the darkness.  The templars lit candles and torches and placed them around the witch's prison in brass lamps heavily engraved with symbols of protection.  Heavy shutters had been placed on the windows of each of the houses and blocked any light coming from them.  The cloaked man walked around the prison

The night grew steadily colder and a stiff breeze started to blow.  It rattled off the houses and squeezed through the cracks of the walls.  The cloth of the witch's prison started to flap and flutter, forming a ring of steel and timber.  Surrounding the cage.  They closed the panels on the lamps, trying to prevent the wind from blowing them out.  The wind attacked the lamps like it was targeting them.  The flames of the candles flickered  and went out.  The templars tried silently to re-light them, failing more often than they were successful.

Inside the prison the witch cowered against the post

“Leave the lamps

Outside the protected circle of light creatures formed.  Creatures born from darkness and twisted by it.  They rose from the ground, morphing all the time.  One second they were almost shapeless, blowing like burnt paper in the wind, half hidden by the darkness.  The next second they were solid and earth bound, plodding forward with heavy earth shaking footsteps, giant collections of mass with red, burning eyes.  The next again they were fleeting and slick, snarling forward with gnashing teeth and slashing claws.  Other times attempting piercing single attacks against lone members of the templars.  They never entered the light but stayed on the very edges of it

The templars met them with stoic gazes and statuesque figures.  Hard eyes glinted from behind their face guards, they held their torches aloft in an attempt to spread the light.  Behind them, in the prison, the witch cackled or whimpered repeatedly, though without any obvious connection to events outside herself.

The first rays of sunlight burned through the creatures and

The cloaked man tossed a few silver coins onto the ground beside the shrine of Tine.  He could feel the eyes of the villagers on him
“They tried to frighten us, speaking to the statue of Tine in the small shrine.  “Why would they do that?”  He waited for a second and then shrugged.  Why did evil do anything?  He spurred his horse and caught up with the slow moving procession.

The winter sun hung low in the morning sky; it had barely breached the tree tops and yet it was almost at its zenith. Sunbeams darted out amongst the snow-burdened pines and spruces of the Arden; a dazzling array of luminous lances thrusting out of the mists towards them. The three brothers set out at first light; it was Amadeus’ sixteenth-winter, just like his brothers had on their sixteenth-winters.

Amadeus could still hear the distinctive sound of steel rasping on steel. He took a deep breath of mist-ridden air, not a stag hunt.

I'll explain. Fantasy is a huge genre

When you walk into a bookstore or library

For example. If I see a fantasy book with a shirtless guy with a sword called the Prince of Fantasycountryname I am *not* picking it up. But that's just me. It's very likely that this exact same book is the first to catch the interest of ten other readers right behind me. And that's great.
However, something slightly mythical that doesn't reference any specific characters or have any fantasy names in it, I'm going to pick that up and read the first chapter, no problem. Because that's the kind of book I like, and that cover, and that title, clue me in that it fits the subgenre of my choosing.
And some people will pick up both, and if you are writing horror, or D&amp;D inspired, or something about dragons...clueing people in right away is the surest way to attract readers that are going to like your book.

So what is your title, but in general you have a sense of what's going on there.

But I don't like the general 'Go to the museum and....' Its been done to often (Spiderman

2) Establish characters sooner.
Currently it takes 4 chapters for the first sign of magic- that's WAYYY to long to get to the awesome parts. What tips do you have for a story like this for getting the action going quicker? I don't want to just say 'Everything was normal and then BOOM' but it needs to be quicker than it is.

3) My idea is when you can see the magic, but my question is this - How would you reveal characters natural abilities in a way that isn't to obvious?

I know I'm being vague

Currently I want this small group of characters (3 men, and the visor lifted will remove 'The Shroud' basically your blindfold from the magic around you.

There are 5 other magic relics (all based from the same suit of armor) around the world that they are hunting down. Magic has a cost. Every time you use it

Fast forward

Here are the relics thus far:

Helmet - Removes the Shroud (The dad has this)
Sword - You get the power of the last person killed with it. (Giant plot hook with this)
Chest piece - You're immune to losing memories from magic (The gargoyle has this currently)
I would like to have 2 more relics

Here is my basic thoughts:

I have this idea of a thing I am calling the Qunitessence.  Basically it is a combination of our world's dark matter and Star Wars' Force.  It is a basic building block of the multiverse.  All things come from it and it is a part of everything   It is a force

From the Quintessence all sources of magic originate.

Psionics harness it from the inside.
These powers are usable with little more than a though.  This also actually makes the user a little more superior than others because of the ability to manipulate this internal energy/power.

Arcane manipulates it from with out.
These powers or spells must be used by drawing in external energy and manipulating it.  Words and gestures must be used.  This weakens the user over time as the cost of using outside energies.

Divine borrows it from an outside intermediary.
These powers are accessed through prayer and worship.  The user borrows energy from a more powerful outside being.  The cost paid is worship to a higher power.

Does this make sense?  Is it a viable system of magic?  Any thoughts or suggestions would be great.",,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/13pjy8/could_use_some_help_with_a_magic_system_please/

&gt;Coldrich Academy, that’s what the lay people of the kingdom of Derulan are told anyway. To the mages within its stone walls, however, Coldrich is a prison. Young boys and girls who were found to have magical ability are brought there against their will under the orders of a tyrant king. Forced to learn how to use their powers for war, they are forever cut off from their homes, families, friends

&gt;Seventeen-year-old Elissa Caldwin was brought to Coldrich when she was little more than a year old. Convinced by the Magerate, and was “saved” from spending her years in an orphanage, she remained grateful to the Academy. That is, until only a year before her graduation exams, when a young boy was brought in from her home town hints that the truth of her origins may be much more sinister. With this new boy, and her best friend’s help, she learns the horrible truth, she escapes the prision-like walls of Coldrich with her two friends into an unfamiliar world

&gt;What they find, ravaged by battles between Derulan, and other ~~human, elven, and dwarven~~ nations in King Norvec’s hunger for conquest. Within it, rumors of rebellion have begun to emerge from the depths of society. The three mages discover that it is a cruel world outside of Coldrich, and surviving it may be too much for them to handle...

The third paragraph is kinda vague, the plot is a little unfinished after they leave the academy. And by a little, I mean very much. 

So are there any issues? Any ideas for things that could be added? Any ideas for things that could happen after they escape (as I'd consider almost anything)?

He stood there waiting, no blood from the wound. He just stood there. Maybe he was frozen, a wealth of unwanted knowledge showed in that moment. I quickly took out my dagger slashed his throat. He stood. 
I kicked him down and stabbed him again, tears ran from my eyes. And he passed and I sat there, with gore on my hands, yet no blood. I removed the arrow, and it was clean, I rolled him over and that is when I saw it. His whole right side was covered in black boils, like fresh tar. It bubbled and burst.

I've never posted anything like this before

I've had the basic premise of this post living in my head for years. It hasn't had anywhere to go before now, crippled by doubts and that nagging feeling you get when you're too terrified to stick around long enough for someone to tell you you're not good enough, just in case they might be right.

Writing, the love of a wonderful man, but I have a lot of complicated relationships with people I have invented. The characters in my stories inhabit my head. I know where they were born and what colour their eyes are. I know what they think about when they wake up and how they react to pressure, grief, fear, joy. I have fallen in love with each and every one of them, though that has never been something which has edged into my actual life. I don't mean love in that sense. I have to love them to feel what they're feeling

I have gone off on a tangent already. That's okay. This is basically a brain-fart I want to throw into the wind (Oh, better stand downwind for this) and if no one reads it, that's fine. I just need to get it out of my head otherwise it will give me no peace.

I marvel at people with the ability to wrangle their worlds and characters into structures and make a novel of them. Mine run free and I have no idea how to tame them. That's probably the wrong word for it. I have no idea how to manoeuvre them into the places they need to be to make a story rather than a series of scenes which play out over and over in my head.

How is possible? How can a book be tamed to paper? It just seems insurmountable to me.

You have an idea. But you can't just write. You need a world with continents and cities and towns and villages. You need to craft the economic and politic structure of these places, they have to be written too.

Your main characters need to be real, too, and how in the world do you murder someone you've fallen in love with?

Where do I start? Draw a map? Have an idea? When does the process of writing a novel actually become about writing? So many of my ideas and characters have faded because I don't know the answer to that question. I can't get it out of my head properly

Audrad III af Hilmljar
Audard [1], having slain a number of competitors and claimants so as to accede to the cilndun [4]. Audrad is notable as the first of the Llegian [5] Emperors to formally accept the treaty of Aunbey [6], though he made no effort to sign it or put it before the Imperial Diet. 

The border with Llewyr [7] was, and thereby fortified in a manner similar to that which was stipulated in the treaty. A number of fortresses and outposts were built all along the border, with many leagues of forestland being cleared away so as to allow for their construction.

He is known as an excellent leader of men, and a man with a careful eye for detail – his reputation cemented further by his various honest dealings with his fellows Llewyric lords and rivals. 

In the ninety-fifth year after the great revolt, and killed the man that had been appointed imperial governor of the territories. As such, the Empire offered Magvarr the title of imperial vassal – supplying him with arms and additional prisoners, such that he pledges to continue to maintain, in perpetuity, the border between the Empire and Llewyr.

I'm working on two stories

Devon Lancoon: Devon's a 17 year old teenager, his father kills his mother and himself, orphaning Devon. Devon is unfairly accused of the crime and the corrupt government tries to execute him unfairly without trial. During said execution, Historic powers awaken within him, and he realizes he has obtained the power of someone known as a vessel: a person who has obtained the powers of a elemental spirit. He manages to escape, forcing him to run from the government hunting him down, and cant even be seen in his home country, he meets others with powers and situations like his

In terms of personality, and yet gentle person. He does everything he can for those around him, taking the position of leader when nobody else wants to. Even when the burdens of leadership weigh him down, he makes sure he breaks down out of the sight of his peers, so their confidence in him doesnt waver. He's the vessel of music, and as such has a deep abiding love for music and just the sounds around him in general. His love for the world, humanity, yet even he can be broken in times of tragedy

I have two main characters for the story I'm currently writing.

Carter (name to be changed) is a 16 year old boy studying to be a Fusion (a type of magic in which weapons (blades, Theesefields, accused of letting loose ancient monsters to commit acts of terror on Aneris. When the city and academy are subsequently demolished during a raid by monsters, Carter finds himself with nowhere to go, his friends dead, and his father nowhere to be seen. He sets out on a journey to find his mother to stay with, but in the process becomes involved deeply in the war between the two nations, creating a conflict that stretches to hell and heaven.

In terms of personality, and popular kid at the Knights Academy of Anerim, but is somewhat softspoken and shy around strangers, and doesnt outwardly try to make friends outside the ones he already has. Carter's a very skilled fighter, and the best in his class. He is very simple-minded about worldly issues, and as such finds war and conflict/politics to be pointless and stupid, but chose his contradictory career as a knight out of passion and patriotism for his country as well as being pressured by his general father. He is overwhelmed and thrown into shock when Aneris is destroyed, and for the first time is placed in a situation where he must fend for himself. He's very passionate about what he believes in

The second main character is Grace, rather than using a weapon to be a vessel for the magic like fusion knights). Her relation to Carter is merely as a friend of a friend, and they have spoken, but not extensively. Grace has a very warm, welcoming personality, despite being very softspoken and overwhelmingly gentle. She doesn't speak often around people she isn't comfortable around, but is a good judge of character and will act towards a person immediatley as she analyzes them. She's very loving and cares for all, she finds her friends dead as did Carter, and through their trials and tribulations grow to be an inseparable pair. She is more people smart than Carter

She walked slowly though Old Town, her geta sandals *click-clack*ing down Burgess Street and Buttermere Lane, winding toward the river. Walking alone, unseeing, trapped by her thoughts, she traced a meandering path through the slums of Sparrow’s Fort and Teachly. A nocturnal wandering, down thoroughfares named for long-dead Generals and Senators, her footsteps muttered

The smell of the river was strong here, as melt-water and the days of rain fuels  its fury. Higher and higher up the bank it reaches, waging endless war against the heavy stone walls restraining it. Eventually the river would win. Across the black water stretched Quaker’s Bridge, a garish, Baroque monstrosity, reaching out as if to drag the middle-class respectability of Crowswood and the sweeping, crenulated dome of Saint Oswyth’s Tabernacle into the mire of their lower-caste cousins. 

She stopped, melancholic. Into the patchwork, ever-changing tapestry of the River.
 
It reflected back those earthy heavens

She hadn’t heard his shuffling footsteps in the night, frantic whispers – if she had she may have been more wary, more on-edge. Although, perhaps not.

Chapter 1: Prophecy Shmophecy 

In a magical land far away, surrounded by swirling clouds.  This king had a thing for stealing from the young, picking on the old, and would occasionally force himself onto any woman of his liking.  In other words, he was a bit of a cunt.  But he was damn fine looking, so that made it alright.  

One day, because how else would people know he was king?  Off he rode on his dark horse, into the dark night - his cape flapping in the wind.  He disappeared into the forest below.

As he galloped along in a blaze of glory
‘Oh for fucks sake, rubbing his face in an almost sulking manner.  As he opened his eyes, his vision focused on a mysterious figure in a cloak that smoked softly.
‘Who’s there?  Speak!  This is the kings’ kingdom.  And I’m the king!’
The cloaked figure gave a little curtsy.  ‘Oh good king
‘Well, loyal servant.’
‘I’m afraid I cannot.’
‘You refuse a direct order of the king?!  What sort of blasphemy is this?’  He grabbed the cloak and flung it over.  But what he saw, as if nothing was ever under it.
‘I know what this is, it’s blacks.’
‘Magic?’  said the figure
‘I know what I said.’
‘I have grave news
‘Well,’ he said, stroking a money pouch hanging from his belt.
‘There is a young boy...’
‘Why tell me this?  I’m a king
‘They say he is the chosen one that will one day claim the sword of legend and kill the king
The air frosted over as the kings mad eyes widened.
‘Is that so?  Some little shit thinks he can come into my kingdom and give it hope?  Oh, clenching his fist, ‘I’ll smash him to pieces, whether he’s wearing glasses or not - I don’t discriminate.’
‘The child is at the tender age of thirteen

‘Oh, I’ll go to the retired knight Gandlin, the best the land has ever seen.  Surely he’ll see something special in me that will prompt him out of retirement one last time to teach me the ways of unlocking my true potential I never knew existed through motivational montages, so that I may defeat a boy less than half my age.’
‘I think he’s already helping the child.’

I’ll show them all!’  He laughed maniacally as he got back on his horse.  ‘If this boy thinks he’s getting a happy ending, he walked into the wrong parlour.’

The door opened again.
‘What was that?’ said Gillitus
‘Oh

The door slammed shut a final time.  The wizard wearily retreated back to the cauldron.  As he peered in one last time before emptying it
‘I’ve made a terrible mistake…’
Quickly, but it was too late - Gillitus was already gone.

Beyond the furthest vestiges of civilization, the lingering remnant of a once vibrant entity. The imposing trees had died with everything else, and had overtime petrified, leaving the bark ashen pale, with branches grasping out in crooked poses, yearning for life when their final breath had long been exhaled. 

No animals flitted between the ferns and bushes of the undergrowth. They too, consuming upon the rot and ruin.

Over time, replaced with the cold stench of death.

A curse such as  this would not have been inflicted by mother nature, which slowly,  had been transformed into something resembling a crypt.

At the heart of this crypt, chiseled quickly and refined only enough to provide a shape for the vessel. Its contours and surfaces were as pristine as the day it was laid upon the now barren earth, a testament to the fear which it inspired, rather than any reverence which it might have been paid. 

Residing within a circular clearing of the forest, came near it. Instead, all  space in its vicinity was, lifeless, a fair demonstration of the power which it contained.

Locked within the ink-dark crypt was something ancient. It held no lineage or title

A lingering reminder as to the dangers of forbidden knowledge, like a sheep to its shepherd. Having bent its knee to the alters of many a dark and festering horror, it soon found the rewards of loyalty. Its lords confided in It secrets long forgotten, and thus it transgressed where those of the mortal world should not, in search of greater power to satiate a never ending hunger.

Rife with power, pitting vile creatures it had dredged from the earth against the armies of men.  

Alas, the determination of Man could not be overcome. Cold steel slew its beasts, their black blood seeping into the ground from which they were drawn.

Eventually, deep within this selfsame forest. Though the ranks of men stretched to either ends of the horizon, a single soul ventured forth into the maw of the beast. 

It is still not known how the Guardian brought low the undead master

 But through the gifts it had been granted, to reside until eternity in a monument to its failure.

Millenia passed, its body falling victim to forces of nature. And though its body rotted away, its mind remained keen. 

Upon its imprisonment, however, it found a gift within its solitude.

Time.

The time to think, it began to plot as it once had. A plan began to form, how it would return, and kill the the Guardian, who, legend said, still kept vigil outside the withered treeline.

1373227355.0,1htgyp,Any tips on making my inverted universe believable?,slish86,11,5,17,"Hello fellow writers!

I'm a first time poster to this subreddit, so I thought maybe I'd dare asking for specific tips!

The thing is I'm currently in the planning stage of writing a fantasy. I one day had the idea of making a world based on the universe being inverted, so it will feature continents, great bodies of water and I would also like for it to have different biomes. A magical sun of some sort would also be present in the middle of the hole. (Yup, the whole thing might be quite overboard, but please bear with me! I'm sure people have written stranger things in the fantasy genre)

Even though this is obviously very high fantasy stuff

- What features would appear if one were to make such a large hole in a planet? If one side of the inverted planet were closest to the core of the real planet I'm guessing it would probably be riddled by volcanoes and a hotter climate, but for the fun of it, any ideas on what might happen?

- Is it even plausible

- How would the world be affected by basically never having night? Animals evolving differently

- How would gravity work? I've been thinking that if the outer planet is big enough, but is it plausible at all to have functioning gravity everywhere in the hole? I've been playing with the idea that there is no gravity, but instead the magical sun is always pushing with a force outwards from itself, creating an inverse gravity. I'd however like to refrain from explaining everything illogical with ""It's magic!"".

- Would weather work the same way as in a normal planet? Thinking about it

So if any of you could answer my questions, but I feel that this is just such a little part of my story that it'll be okay to ask for some pointers.

His breathing heavy, lifting himself up from the earthen field on which the combatants fought. His brown and blue fighter’s uniform was greatly singed, while his face bore ash marks from an earlier attack by Akko. The crowd in the stadium was solidly behind Akko, cheering on who many felt would soon be the National Champion, sure that with the match in its final minutes, he would be taking the victory. With the match leaning in Akko’s favor, he knew that these last few minutes of action were more than enough time for his opponent to make a comeback. Looking at him now, the opportunity to make it one step closer to the finals and tournament victory was ever present, a style he had been using much of the match against the fast and aggressive style of his opponent. The results of the match were shown on the Cloud Town competitor, switching stances—seeing the moment’s hesitation

“Akko Adregi advances to the finals!” exclaimed the announcer over the PA system

The referee took Akko’s arm and raised it, and Akko waved to the cheering crowd in the stadium as he made his exit from the arena, giving one last glance back at the defeated fighter who now held his face in his hands; the smile left Akko’s face, he never liked that part of the job.
 
“Akko

His friend Pietro stood just inside the tunnel that led down into the Alter City Stadium’s understage. The understage consisted of fighter’s rooms, and general areas as needed by the team. As he drew closer to Pietro, Akko saw that the look on his friend’s face was not that of congratulations, but of a serious manner. Pietro’s demeanor carried over to Akko as his friend’s pale blue eye’s looked into his own brown eyes.

“There’re some people here who really want to meet you

From the tone of his voice

“What’s the matter?”

Pietro let out a sigh as he ran his hand through his short white stringy hair

“What are you doing getting involved with the Aduri Syndicate?”

Taken aback by this, that the question made so accusingly, was a joke. Finding none, his brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about?”

“A pair of Aduri are waiting for you below

“When I find out myself

“So you’re telling me you know nothing of this?”

“No.”

Pietro thought for a moment before speaking

Akko nodded before following Pietro down the steps and through the large metal doors that led to the understage. As the doors closed behind them, stopping outside of Akko’s room.

“They’re in my room?”

“Zephyr and your brother Ulrich are in there as well

The four occupants turned to the new entrants, the man was nothing special, the average suited thug, though this one wore glasses; the bulge under his jacket suggested that he had a gun, something he was sure the others had spotted as well. The woman on the other hand, looked as if she had just walked off of the runway. Her striking red hair flowed down her back over a tightly fit overcoat; Akko couldn’t help but think it worked well with her figure.

“What’s this about then?” Akko asked

“They haven’t told us anything aside from wanting to speak with you, “So what is it then?”

The woman stepped towards Akko

“Not gonna happen

Akko put his hand on Pietro’s shoulder

“You sure?” Zephyr asked

At Akko’s assurance

“So spill

 “We’ve come with a proposition

“What kind of proposition?” 

“Our leader has had his eye on you for some time now

“Not interested

“These are pressing times Mr. Adregi, if you’re not on the right side, you won’t make it very much longer.”

“Is that a threat then

“No, “our leader feels that there are powers at play that concern all of us.”

“Maybe it concerns you guys,” Akko said, “anything you guys do doesn’t concern me.”

“All of us

“Okay, what exactly would your boss want from me?”

“That, “But whatever it may be, you will be well compensated for your service; you’d never need to work here again.”

Akko nods his head and puts his hand to his chin considering, a woman—beautiful might I add, and the silent muscle,” Akko gestured to the man in the suit, “and once I join you, I’ll be making more money than I ever would here, am I following correctly?”

The woman remained thin lipped, I love it. And for your boss to even think I would dream of leaving this to go be some criminal lackey, he must be quite a fool to—

“Don’t you dare disrespect him!” her demeanor changed almost instantly, went for his gun at the outburst.

Akko’s own hand shot out and held the Aduri’s hand against the gun, putting him on wobbly legs. At the same moment, the door burst open and the others rushed into the room upon hearing the noise. Everyone froze, the only sound in the room was that of the blood dripping into the carpet from the Aduri’s broken nose, which he was trying futilely to lessen the flow of. Ulrich rushed over, removing the Aduri’s hand from the gun, allowing Akko to step back while he stayed close.

“I’ll pass on the offer, you’ll see the exit I want you to be moving through.”

The Aduri turned and walked out of the room, as the four watched the Aduri head down the hallway. After the parting look, they began to mill back into the room.

“Guys

The others went back to the door and looked down at what now seemed to be a standoff. The two Aduri stood perhaps a dozen feet from another duo, embers flowing through her hair as flames danced around her.

“HEY!” Pietro called out, “take your Org Wars somewhere else.”

“Lightning Falcons

Someone comes around the corner near the Lightning Falcons and looks at them, looking back once more at Akko and the others before departing into the opposite direction.

The night lights of Alter City shone around them as the brothers cruised through the downtown, the airships patrolled the skies, shining light down into the darkened city below.

“That car’s been following us since we left the stadium

“Any idea who it could be

“I’ve got one guess

Akko knew what he meant

Ulrich pulled up beside the establishment

Akko got out of the car and walked into the bar. The jukebox played in the corner, one that had everyone else in the area laughing in overly done fashion. Nearby a trio of construction workers were noticeably annoyed, but aside from glares in their direction, continued conversing among themselves, adding their voices to the buzz of conversation that filled the air. The barman nodded to Akko as he took a seat at the counter.

“What’ll it be sir?”

From his peripheral, was towards the Akko.

“Gimme a bottle of your cheapest liquor

The barman raised an eyebrow

Akko said nothing as the Syndicate member took a seat beside him. The barman placed the bottle in front of Akko, busying himself with cleaning a glass.

“Have you had a change of heart?” the Aduri asked

Akko smirked

“You’re not making this easy.”

“On the contrary

The Aduri turned to face Akko, “it’d be in your best interest to come with us.”

Akko had already noticed when he’d moved his hand to the imprint in the overcoat that resembled a revolver. As he turned to the Aduri, now in the building, smash one of the Syndicate member’s face into the table, before spinning around and kicking another table, sending it flying at the next Aduri who was getting up from his seat, hitting him square in the face. The last Aduri had no time to react before the bottle struck the side of his head. He fell from the stool, joining his comrades

“Easy enough

The jukebox’s tune now seemed out of place as all eyes now looked upon the two brothers, drawn out clap. The brothers turned to the lone clapper, and seated in the center of the large group in the corner, sat a sleek haired, well dressed gentleman around Akko’s age, one side of his mouth curled into a half smile as he looked upon the two men, his eyes held a sort of fine pompousness about them.

“Let’s get out of here

Ulrich nodded and followed his brother out of the bar. As noise returned to the room

The ambassador hummed in thought, eat it nor smelt it. It is not magic, dense or any other property that could be put to use. Unless they wish to distract us while the rebellion rages'. 

'My lord, or have convinced others of a use and seek to confirm what they already know before striking further bargains'.  The ambassador fell silent, Rossart nervously stepped back. 

On Arriving at the docks a fortnight ago, had set the tone for their working relationship. With the suffering attaché trying to retain deference while his superior ranted against the barbarism, insanity, greed, spinelessness and altogether unchivalrous nature of things in this accused/dammed/stinking city. Rossart for what seemed like an eternity waited the latest aristocratic tantrum. When instead the ambassador spoke 'very well' Rossart nearly tripped over his own feet. 

'My lord?' 

'Let them have their little expedition, then they shall see what happens when one approaches a lord of the Qulathar empire like a common market trader'. 

The new year in Freeport was off to a slow start. The night winds had blown a way the smoky miasma of the previous nights bonfires and fireworks. To be replaced by the slothful effect of a thousand thousand hangovers that pulsed in the morning sun. With a brown cloak covering his blue robes with yellow trimming, Boatman came face to face with Rossart. 'I trust the ambassador has had a good new years, I have matters to discuss'. 

'Indeed he does senator, standing in front of the fireplace above which the freshly painted coat of arms of house Derwent now stood proud below that of the emperors.
'I thank you for the invitation

'there will be no deliberations, but perhaps there is little hope  of speedy gains. A party of six will suffice, with one caveat. They cannot be from Freeport. As you say yourself you are a neutral party, questions would arise if you were to see seafaring folk so far inland. You will have to arrange for, private contractors as you call them'.

Arms folded the ambassador smirkingly looked on as senator Boatman looked up lips moving in silent mental calculation. 'I believe that the terms are acceptable

After the senator had departed

'no

In the college of alchemists, soaks and crowded docks with their winding and dark alleys. Boatman had no need to mind, he had nothing more important today. No one would question someone visiting an old friend on new years. 'have you made the necessary arrangements?' Queryed Malchick brushing crumbs from her chest around the pendant that signified the highest qualification in alchemy.

'Yes' replied Boatman swallowing a lump of bread while looking around the shelves of rare herbs

'so we have room for the party of four?' Malchick removed the empty plates from her large oak desk.

'Six provided that they are not local' grinned Boatman

CHAPTER ONE – The Librarian

Ariya had no idea that she was a witch. She didn’t care much for the world beyond the library, was all she knew. She picked up several tomes from a table that those that visited the library often left lying about. They were old, worn, and neglected.

She read the names of the tomes so as to get an idea of where the tomes belonged in the library. She remembered reading several of the tomes, “The Tale of Yeril, and Beril.” She had never read that one before.

She took the tomes, she walked outside of the library into the courtyard. The wind swept down from the mountains, adding that particular chill to the air that was oft felt on days such as these. She sat quietly, perched on the stone bricks that encircled a small flower garden. As she opened the book to read it, she noticed that most of the pages were torn out. She sighed, closed it, and stood up. This book would have to be reported as damaged.

She entered the library. The hall was lined with many tall windows that allowed the outside light to spill through, clutching her book in her arms. This woman was young, only twenty. She was a slender youth, with straight brown hair and piercing blue eyes. Mostly quiet, and reserved, she kept to herself.

She grew up under the care of her father, destitute, and wretched. He had fled from the eastern kingdom from those times of conflict with his daughter, and made his way to the kingdom of Sanria, where they both resided. There were many children like her these days, orphans of a war that took place two decades ago. Then, she was no more than a babe, and crying out for the attention that one requires while that young

Her father would later ride off to assist in the war effort, that he had slain many of the enemy before they overwhelmed him, and snuffed his life out. This left Ariya to fend for herself by the time she was thirteen years of age. She, however, was always proud of her father for protecting everybody from what was said were a wicked people that were attempting to oppress the peoples of Sanria.

She had learned many things about the Eastern kingdom growing up. Her father, like other children that grew up in her kingdom, were taught to dislike those from the Eastern kingdom, as wicked fools that carried out orders at the behest of their heartless ruler. This is why she, and many children, and others like her grew up detesting witches, and anything to do with them. It always seemed a fantastic tale. Witches were only myths. Ariya detested the idea of it since she loved her father

It was probably the worst time in her life. She remembered when her father left. She begged him not to go. She cried. He reassured her that this was something that he had to do, playful girl she was. Days passed. A week went by. Time continued to meld one day to the next, and the weeks passed. She waited.

Other men came back, fathers. Her father didn’t come back. A year passed. She played games with other children to pass the time. A popular game to play was “knights and witches.” Nobody ever wanted to be the witch. Witches were terrible, ugly people, and knights were noble, just people. Ariya played the game. Being a little girl, she was usually the witch. The other boys “killed” her for being the witch with their sticks, and brought her to justice.

Two years passed. Her father didn’t come back. The boys weren’t interested in playing those children’s games anymore. She noticed they looked at her differently. She didn’t like the way they looked at her. She became reclusive

Three years passed. She was sixteen. She had spent so much time in the library that she didn’t have friends anymore. The headmaster of the library had taken notice of how much time she spent there. She began to work there as one of the librarians sorting through the books
Word came back one day. She still remembered standing there in the library. A royal messenger walked up to her, and went home. She was angry, hurt, confused.

Nobody saw her for a month. The headmaster visited her house to check on her. She told him. He was a kind

Ariya grew up in Aques, vibrant country. Looking out one of the tall windows Ariya saw the mountain to the west. There was also a river that flowed down from the mountain along the northern edge of the city. She remembered Aques was called the city of life since ancient times when it was first founded.

Ariya was quite fond of reading such material, and histories were among her favorite things to read. Fantasy she thought, was better than life, and so often was she found reading some book, or scroll that had some fantastic tale in it that she at times forgot about the real world.

So it was the same today when she was not paying attention, and it landed on the floor with a rather loud thud. Ariya looked up, and snapped out of her daze. Standing before her was a rather tall man. He was obviously from the military as his dress was of such a nature of those that served in the military of Sanria.

“Hey

“I am so sorry

The man shrugged his shoulders, then lowered her head, and let out a sigh. She was not even clear-headed enough to pay attention to her surroundings, she thought. How idiotic. She had obviously made a complete fool out of herself, and he was sort of cute.

She looked up, he had probably made his way to some unseen section. It was always her luck, bumping into some strange good-looking guy, and making a complete fool out of herself without much to say about the situation. She would usually be called some disparaging term.

Rows, and heavy. Mostly though, they were not single books, but rather collections of works, bound into thick volumes. The works were placed in the volumes according to relevance. Relevance was key here, because most of the books, and other materials in this place were boring

She made her way over to the section that the book she had borrowed came from, one had to come here, and read the books in the library, or out in the courtyard or the general premises to be able to make use of it. Most of the copies were unique, and the library did not have replacements for the volumes within. 

It was getting late, as night time would be setting in soon.
She strolled through the city as she made her way home. Springtime was here

“A rose for your loved ones!” she said.

She held out several roses. Ariya gave a silver coin to the girl

Once inside of her house

Ariya made her way back to the commons room
She removed a pendant hung about her neck. It was the last memento of her father. Inside of a solid gold crescent moon lay a blue orb

The night wore on, and crawled into it. The cold feel of the sheets against her skin was relaxing.

She dreamed. She was on the top of a rocky hill with some other woman. Her lips moved as though talking. Ariya didn’t fully understand what she was saying. The woman attacked her. There was a fantastic battle. Her dream changed.

She was on her back

Chapter 1: The Bloodhouse. 
Vyola had never been to a fighting ring before. She was good in a scrap – she knew she was, a kind of grim human pleasure. But she’d never enjoyed watching one. The bitter disgust that came with viewing violence was far too strong in her. Still, she found her feet padding onward to the Bloodhouse, Dreer’s one and only arena where murder was permitted – a true gladiator ring. 

The winding, mould and sweat saturated every surface and made up the air that Vyola drew in. This clinging scent grew stronger as she stepped lightly toward the city centre. She was entirely detached; once a youth pushed her to the side pointlessly. She slapped wetly into the straw side of a building and dirtied her hands, cursing, but pressed on grimly, ignoring the laughs behind her. She at one point stepped directly onto a shard of something cold; it gave her a neat-looking puncture wound that felt fundamentally wrong, as invasive lacerations will. She rested for a short while. The only place to sit was the floor, damp under Vyola’s backside. It made her grimace, men and women of all ages pulled carts toward the market

Thieves were everywhere. Vyola liked to play a little game; she’d dart her sharp eyes through the sparse life around, or simply not care. The few honest ones would not be able to stop the thieving, and it would only land Vyola with a reputation she did not much relish. She had also found that the thief, ironically, is his own best target; those euphoric from their successful heist are often the least wary of having the catch plucked.

And besides

Brushing her simple tan tunic and trousers off as she stood and began to walk again, her feet would correct themselves instantly, as though they were bound with a spell. When she attempted to stop altogether, she felt ill at ease. This odd sense of danger built inside her like the roaring tides of the Oyerën sea, and gradually evolved to panic, sending her pulse thumping and her mind buzzing. She ran then. 

She found herself at the gate to the ring at exactly midday. The sun was at its highest point. A scarce few of its brass rays penetrated the perpetual gloomy clouds that hung over the place. She noted the shift under her feet, to the cold, wet stone of the Bloodhouse’s entrance. 

The gatekeeper was a weedy

Vyola pushed and prodded aside several men and one woman, an enormous gladiator wearing a motley collection of armour smashed in the head of his opponent with a terrible crack. Vyola did not flinch, but a small curl of distaste found its way onto her lips. She did not overly sympathize with the dead man, but the juggernaut in the ring made her skin crawl with his hooded eyes and apish movement. 

To her he looked like an immense, and so Vyola asked him when the great King’s tournament began. He gawped at her as though she were a dribbling moron, and told her that she was watching it. Vyola moved away from him after that, as he had begun to look at her as though she were a piece of food. 

The King’s tournament was held once every three years; men and women from all over the assembled provinces of Mornefall would compete, bribed, blackmailed, and fought for the interests of various leaves on that venerated tree of royals. Most were great warriors, and scholars too, their minds whirring with new theories and inventions.

It was rare that one would actually be chosen for this tight ring of handymen
elevated and trained in such a way. 

Vyola wondered whether the man now dominating the ring would be taken by the King’s men to be tested should no-one defeat him today. She imagined that he’d be escorted in to the true centre of Mornefall, from which the nation took its name. It was often called the Pale City, on account of the immense numbers of ivory and marble statues that lined its walkways and rafters. It sounded like a nice place to visit, but then again, she wouldn’t be seeing it any time soon. The beastly man in the ring startled her out of her thoughts as he gave a primal yowl of victory.  

Slink had given up extracting a toll from people. Instead they streamed in, with wide brims designed to keep the near-constant rain out of the eyes. Vyola was pushed to a space the very edge of the arena, and her hands, pallid from cold, latched onto the railing grimly. Her knuckles stood out of her slender hands. 

Silence fell all around the Bloodhouse as Slink wormed his way under the railing and half-ran to the giant in the centre. He raised his voice to a high-pitched screech, was a champion appointed by the King, and had been unbeaten in this ring for the past three years, though he had never been picked for the Royal Guard. As he spoke, a few obviously underfed attendants ran into the middle of the arena and cleared away the squelching mess that had been the last contender’s body. Slink, with his dirty rat face and tattered red cloak, then asked in a lower, if any brave warrior dared to face him and prove him a fraud.

The roar Vyola expected did not come. No man stepped forward. It seemed the crowd of assorted peasants, pickpockets, and ranks of beggars were all holding one breath, a breath that when exhaled would bring death. The excitement – or fear of the people was tangible. It was almost noisy, ringing silently in the ears. Seconds slid by. Vyola felt every beat of her heart. The sea seemed to swell in her mind and an irregular drumbeat boomed behind her eyes. 

Hak twisted slowly on the spot, pockmarks, and some sort of rash rendering him horrifying. The toughened leather plates over his legs and arms did little to hide his misshapen, lumpy, muscled form. Some religions of Iwara, Mornefall’s easternmost province, regarded outward ugliness as a reflection of sickness inside. If this were true

Slink began to list, shelter, education were all offered by the generous royalty. A future beckoned, claimed the oily man. Silence hung in the air like a malevolent spirit, compelling every spectator to listen with all their might for the one to break it. 

Something rose up in Vyola like bile; a stream of confused emotions, she could feel forests, and caves, mountains and the undiscovered places of Mornefall in every shallow breath she took. In her heart, she found a longing for glory, for learning. She wanted to visit grand cities, to dance and sing and lead expeditions into wild terrain. She needed to leave Dreer. Its claustrophobic gated streets, were a cage. She hated it then
She came back to herself and said

Think *Stargate* with some China Miéville and Jim Butcher thrown in for inspiration

The story is set on modern day Earth

1) There is a sizeable population of supernatural critters (many of them quite inhuman) lurking under their very noses.

2) Magic exists, only converted). And it's more like a tool than anything. For example, unless you have an advanced degree in neurobiology, trying to magically brainwash someone would end very poorly. Think ""performing brain surgery with a three-foot-long rusty scalpel while drunk and blindfolded"".

Herein lies my problem: **On a modern-day Earth where magic must operate (more or less) according to the laws of physics

The more I think about it, the constant ability to take photos and record video with your phone, sites like Reddit that allow people the world over to share any sort of strangeness that they encounter … Even the most carefully hidden society would slip up eventually. **Can anyone think of any good justifications or realistic ways for the supernatural to remain hidden?**

And part two of the question: **What are some reasons that the supernatural community would even *want* to stay hidden?** The obvious one would be that humans outnumber them and have guns. But a leprechaun could use an AK-47 just as well as a person, declare war on humanity, and start rounding up pregnant women so they can eat their fetuses?

Even if (by some miracle) the supernatural world was able to escape the gaze of spy satellites and the nasties were forced to keep the peace and not reveal themselves

Thoran concentrated. The message the elders wanted transmitted to Cradon clan had been received. Thoran knew this as surely as he knew he had eaten Hella’s eggs for breakfast that morning. Cradon clan was three days journey to the east. Had the two clans not had communicators

Cradon’s communicator relayed back that her own elders would need some time to consider this request. They had asked for two days, and accepted the two day waiting period which, including travel time, would be five days. The elders told Thoran they would return Thursday at noon and that he should be waiting for them.

Thoran would be there. The 16-year-old, not after what happened to his best friend. Thoran had seen death before, but never so terrifyingly. Death came to old people, or the infirm. His grandparents had died when Thoran was ten. He remembered it clearly. First Nana and three days later, Papi. They went quietly. Death was not supposed to come to 16-year-old girls. Teenagers were supposed to live forever. 

Thoran was the one who first noticed the rash on Cleanna’s arm. They had been out hunting with Cleanna’s father and uncle. Cleanna didn’t seem too worried and neither did anyone else in those first few days. But then, her entire body was covered in red, pus-filled splotches and the pain became unbearable.

Cleanna screamed at the slightest movement. Thoran was convinced it was the pain itself

The wailing continued for two straight days. Thoran, but could not stand seeing her in such pain, could not stand the screaming, and so they made their excuses and left. Thoran couldn’t leave. He wouldn’t leave. He pushed thoughts at her, the way he pushed thoughts at communicators from nearby villages. He tried pulling responses from her, so she wouldn’t have to speak. 

At first, because she acknowledged them with blinks of her eyes, but even those blinks caused pain. Soon, though, he was able to pull thoughts from her. Was she pushing them out, the way a magian could, or was he reaching inside of her. Thoran didn’t know

Thoran didn’t want to hear anymore. He told her that she would not die, but on the inside he could feel the peace. Her final message to him was a simple goodbye. He didn’t need to look at her to know she was gone, he felt the connection between them break, as if they had been holding hands, and her hand slipped out of his. He tried to reach for her, to pull her back, but it was no use. 

During that week, twenty-four people had become covered in the agonizing, pus-filled sores and the pained wailing sounds of children and adults could be heard throughout the village. 

The elders came to Thoran the day following Cleanna’s passing. Despite his grief, Cradon and Bytomac. Dinlor had no healer. Bytomac and Nacada were dealing with their own similar outbreaks. Cradon had two healers and so far had seen no sign of any rash. They asked for time to be sure the sickness would not come to them and if it did not, they would then send one over.

The elders returned on Thursday

“Them

“Freen became sick

“No, and pull them into himself. The message was there. 

“She says one of their elders has become sick with what they believe is the same rash

“Beg her

Thoran told her. Along with the message

He felt the sadness of her response, but of course it was her elders who were deciding. They had heard the stories about this sickness from Thoran’s village and from the others. They knew they would need as much healing power as the universe could provide and that their healers could harness. They would not be sending help. A single tear came to Thoran’s eye. He said nothing. ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1361730910.0,,

Snow danced by him as he ran—its cool embrace was a welcome relief on his weary body

 

Morning light cast halos on the needles of the fir trees and illuminated the steam that poured from his mouth with each labored breath. He could feel his legs beginning to buckle, not when freedom was so close.

 

The thunderous beat of hooves against the earth shook him in the teeth, one in front of the other. He had dreamed of escape and slipped out quietly during the night while many of the men were having dreams of their own.

 

When he was young he would dream of where to hunt, and he was well respected as an oracle in his village. But then his dreams filled with soldiers, and the soldiers came—they came in hundreds. The frightened villagers blamed him for summoning them. Out of fear, or anger, he was cast out and sold to the Romans as a slave.

 

Trading slavery for a lifetime of service in the Roman legions was a decision he came to detest. His legion was held responsible losing a host of supplies when they retreated from a barbarian sneak attack

 

Decimation required his legion be divided into smaller groups of ten men where each group of soldiers was commanded to draw straws amongst themselves.

 

He watched, he watched as they were bludgeoned to death by their brothers in arms. It went like that through the ranks until a tenth of the legion had destroyed itself. He had seen enough killing, and he would be free from it.

 

He staggered and braced himself against a tree and slumped exhausted beside it. His chest rose and fell rapidly, too tired to continue.

 

The sound of horses and men increased; their black forms appeared hazy in the distance, accepting that his body, and his life, had reached their limit.

 

His eyelids fluttered and his shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes and he let himself dream—just one last time

 

“Stay with us.”

 

The tired soldier was jolted awake. The voice was so clear to him, using it as a crutch to stabilize him as he rose. Slowly, with sword in hand, he stumbled weakly the other side of the tree, but he was alone. The origin of the voice remained a mystery, and his gaze quickly turned to the intangible forms in the distance—they would be on him in moments.

 

His footing waned and he stumbled again, and then in an instant, evaporated. He couldn’t make out what he had just seen. Attributing his delirium to exhaustion, he used his free hand to rub his eyes and attempted to inspect the horsemen, now very near, but again they refused to focus.

 

Again his vision went awry, but again the world was ripped away from him.

 

A valkyrie, he would walk among his ancestors. He could hear his pursuers now, calling his name. But their voices sounded strange, as if echoed through a long and distant tunnel.

 

They had him. He could feel the hot breath of their horses on his neck, his would-be executioner. It was a face of uncertainty, and then terror as his face was washed in a blinding light.

 

As the image of his captain faded it was replaced, each one ending in thin, delicate fingers.

 

She leaned closer

 

“Stay with us.”

Here's where it gets a bit more tricky:

Two characters know magic and can communicate with each other through their thoughts.  So

One character has an implant that functions a lot like Siri on the iPhone (I wrote this before it came out) and so he can occasionally think things to himself, except nobody else hears his implant's analyses.

The rest of the characters frequently take time to themselves to think about things.

I heard one author suggest using italics to signify thought.  No quotation marks

The story takes place in a world inspired by/based on the Viking/Norse civilizations. Geographically


The villages mostly focus on farming and trade as the time period is fairly peaceful, over many centuries the dragons developed the ability to take a humanoid form and faded into legend. The story focuses around a young woman (recently taking on the role of Oracle in her village) meeting a dragon who was exiled from his tribe. The primary genre's are fantasy, adventure, and romance.

The consensus is that all of the titles are crappy except *maybe* ""Bound in Shadows"" which I still think isn't great.

""The Ever Changing Door""

The reason I didn't really think it would actually work even though I like the sound is because the door referenced is introduced within the first two pages of the entire book. Introduced in an obvious significant way. Because its part of a character's plot line.

“I realize now that you’ve grown older, fascinated by the intricacies of a butterfly’s wing, or some other simple yet beautiful thing. However though you may be young and able, and I, old and feeble, hobbled by the uncertainty of my brief yet ever approaching future, there are still many lessons that can be learned from me. Look at yourself, which in and of itself is not entirely a bad thing


“And so I will tell you a story, but also, I shall tell you in the hopes that I may at last become honest with myself for what I’ve done and what I’ve failed to do.”


In the west, brought forth from their halls of stone, precious gems which rivaled in size and beauty even the eye of a dragon. From the lush forests of the northern reach, came the high elves on their ghostly white steads bearing elixirs the likes of which could give one man the strength of ten, or in malice filled thought created, ten men the strength of one. From the rolling meadows and wind swept plains to the south of Dawn, flew the nymphs in their chariots of berkenwood, carrying with them rare herbs and spices. One could hardly disagree that Dawn was the economic capital of the west.


Moreover, the city maintained one of the most regulated, equipped, and well trained armies to grace the earth. In fact, Dawn’s armies we’re comparable to those controlled by the Blackheart of Mirk whom all but snuffed out the existence of the world itself in the Third Age. To that end, Dawn’s armies could only be complimented by its tall, ivy encrusted, topped by haunting concrete angels. Yet


Finally, scholars, and magicians bringing to light such advances as: fiend fire, an annoyingly difficult to master, and even more annoyingly difficult to put out, form of magic which left its wielder capable of setting fire even to water; and the soul reaver, an odd piece of machinery imbued with a slight magical incantation which could change a person’s outlook on life in a matter of seconds through the removal of that individual’s soul. Furthermore, and could be


Nevertheless Dawn owed everything to one man, and an even more unforeseeable future. Solomon was the stuff of legends and seemingly flawless in every way. His knowledge of military tactics, economics, and manipulation was equaled by none, his looks were unmatched, and his tact, impeccable. To say the least, unnerving even the mightiest of opponents with good reason. Still Solomon was a mystery in and of himself. No one knew of his past, many noted that Solomon arrived in Dawn without warning and without reason slowly working his way towards the throne armed with his bewitching charm, tended to wind up… gone. It was unnatural and eerie


It was on such an inquiry that I first found myself in the city of Dawn, a merry fellow with a twinkle in his eye and a hop in his step. Thomas was one to write my family, especially my father, with news of business and matters of everyday life concerning him, and had been ever since He and my father, your great grandfather, started their shipping business together. I was a young man of twenty or so and was sent to Dawn in an attempt to discover why the letters had stopped abruptly

Prologue- The General/ Malignancy
	The sky was grey
	But to Memir and those like him, it had seemed an impossible dream, but today, anything seemed possible.
	Memir’s hopeful spirit was somewhat dampened as the rubble came into site, a clan with the power to unite the other Adamant, and drive back the encroaching Aerin. The attack had resulted in the almost total annihilation of the Leviathonian Adamant. There had been only one survivor Memir was aware of. Ardur, the leader of the united band of Adamant calling themselves the Freebloods, had somehow, as a child not even into adolescence, had escaped extermination. His death, would be the final act of a total genocide. Never again would an adamant of Pure Leviathonian blood walk on Solace.
	Memir now knew, as a child, had been present for this atrocity. The details were lost to him though. All the evidence confirmed that an Ascendent Aerin- or Aerin Augments, as Memir preferred to call himself, had struck the fatal blow, incinerating Fortress Leviathon in one fell blow. But Memir had also been made aware, after conferring with Lesia, to ensure the operation’s success. And based on the total attrition of both attacking Aerin and defending Adamant
	As he strode towards the rubble, alone and buried in stone debris, to the events that had led to that point. He had vague impression of terror and confusion, but no solid events would resolve themselves.
	Not that he had expected them to. He’d come here on a whim. Had he hoped to find absolution amidst the blasted stones of this monument to Aerin ruthlessness? He wasn’t sure himself. But he was desperate for answers
	As he clambered onto the beginnings of the ruin, and barring an extraordinary amount of luck, and Memir didn’t believe in luck, he wouldn’t find anything of interest in the first several days.
	He sat down and a marvelously intact section of wall protruding from the pile
	He looked out over the cliff to the great ocean below. Reptilian coastdarts swooped and wheeled
	Without warning
	He stood and began walking back the way he had come, and his vision became normal again.
	Memir stopped walking. Uncertainly, the headache returned, and the grey again fuzzed at the edges of his vision.
	Determinedly, somehow, he knew he had found what he’d come for.
	Pushing the pain aside, waiting to see if there were any left. When nothing else rose, he violently swept his arms to one side. The rubble followed the motion, tumbling and scattering until they came to rest once more. Memir surveyed the dimple he’d created, which took longer than usual, owing to his migraine impaired vision. There was more rubble in the crater. Memir stared at it, nonplussed
	Memir descended into the crater
	At last, and found only empty space beneath. The pain in his head was overpowering now, threatening to make him pass out. Heedlessly, he dropped to his stomach and reached into the hole he’d created. His hand brushed something. He felt around it, trying to get a grip, when suddenly, something grabbed him instead. 
	Memir Jerked his hand free in startlement
	A tentacle like appendage had wrapped itself around his arm, but Memir could swear that the coils were writhing. He squinted at the thing. All his instincts screamed to get away from the thing, but Memir was sure it was for this grotesque thing that he had come.
	Memir continued to stare, crazed tangles. And then he realized what it looked like. He was holding a brain. A crystalized, warped, brain.
	And at last
	“Hello again, and the sky started to weep with him.

Chapter 1

A stir in the air

  “It is done. We may all be killed for this

  “Don't go second guessing on us!” one of the others replied. Each one present understood the risk, and I will personally slit your throat!”

  “In the name of Drasill, and yet I haven’t lost my mind as you, Arsaun. Save it for out there. By the name of the One, we must succeed, or he may fail himself. Who knows to whom the Sardinale pledge, if to anyone? All I know is if we fail and Drasill dies, may it be postponed

  A snarl covered Arsaun’s face underneath his robe

  “By my sacred name, by my hope for the Life.” As they finished swearing the oath, the ominous figures left the room. After the rest left the room and he was alone, the One with the Most to Lose sighed. He knew that brooding would not help, and he could not afford to doubt now. The world could not afford for him to doubt.

Chapter 2

  The birds no longer chirp as cheerfully as they once had. The rooster call is just a throe  heard by many, the cry for salvation seems exceptionally anguished today. 

  Still new to the entire slavery ordeal, unaware and unconcerned with whoever was watching. No one judges another for showing what some would call weakness, they all had done it at some point, and they would all do it again. The inhabitants of this tiny village have almost forgotten their once care-free lives, and replaced the memories with cold, distant hate. Not hating each other, not even hating the gods. No, deluding his wits. Finally

  Barely old enough to be called a man, the sweet embrace of the raging river while swimming, and a seeming infinite number of other pleasures now out of reach. Just a year ago, then nineteen year old boy, he had little care in the world. Done with children’s lessons, he would try to find his passion, his calling. Now his calling came from a LIZARD, as it shouted orders for the villagers to work harder.

  “Hurry it up! I don't have to feed you, he released a silent prayer to the gods to save his people from this plague. Gadflies upon the land, thriving on the living, the Brinte seemed to feed on their blood no less than ticks. “Slave boy, you don’t seem to understand, so let me speak a little slower. I will kill you unless the field is done within the week.” Searve didn't need the extra emphasis in his voice. The word kill always stirred the villagers to work harder. No one dared not try the giant gecko. He had seen people killed by this monster, and for now

  The land John worked was quite fertile, trees, vines, cultivated roots, flowers and whatever else imagined could be seen throughout the year. Taking advantage of plants growing during different seasons, Viventians were practically guaranteed food at all times. In the autumn, apples decorated the ground, John would always be the first one to start harvesting the cabbage. His mother made a cabbage stew that brought envy to the entire village. Carrots and cabbage, it was not quite time to plant the cabbage seeds, these plants now dominated the fields
John turned his head around, making his daily rounds of overseeing every field.  His mother and sister were probably off helping to prepare dinner, the most dangerous job of all. The Brinte had a nasty temper, and if something was so much as a little tough, the cooks would be severely beaten. Of course, that was only for Searv’s food and the other Brinte. when they decided to visit. No one cared about the food the townspeople would eat, not even the townspeople themselves!

  While there was only one Brinte in the village, Searve had claws that were weapons themselves, although they had used swords and spears during the invasion. His muscles, while not particularly large, worked with mechanical precision. He never exerted himself, even when heaving a poor soul into the air to be tortured one last time before their death.

  Searve's dark green scales seemed impenetrable, killing the entire council. Once that was done, before they even had a chance to comprehend what had happened, before a funeral could be planned, they were forced to pledge to the victors.",,False,t5_2t4ad,True

The gods in my world aren't really meant to be, in fact. To the extent that they *do* exist, though (ie, that my characters believe in them,) they resemble Shinto gods and demons - ancient, awe-inspiring forces of nature. They don't really have a ""plotline"" like in Norse mythology - they just always have and always will exist, indefinitely.

At the same time, and it is slowly dying in the wake of their departure. My characters need to come to terms with this, and begin to consider their motivation to struggle onwards in the wake of the apocalypse. Since I don't care for my narration to be especially omniscient, I'm left floundering for a reason *why* the gods in my story should be doing this. A few motivations I considered for the gods' disappearance were the destruction of something of theirs - a sacred grove or something like that - or a general destruction of nature theme, a la Princess Mononoke. As I mentioned, though, I don't want these gods to be very human - they just don't care what the puny humans are up to, since their doings are fairly unknowable.

I'm in the process of fleshing out a timeline/outline for a novel I plan to write. In this world two factions (Gora and Kevosi) war for ages and finally come to terms with one another. As a sign of good faith for the future the two sides form an economic pact so that both may flourish. One product of this pact is the forming of a unified central (and as of now unnamed) city where the people of each country may live and trade their goods and coexist peacefully. Eventually this city uses its economic nature to grow in power to the point that it overshadows its initial creators and begins to cause problem for everyone through its economic might.

Both the Gora and Kevosi's home lands are ruled through traditional monarchies. I know that I want this city to be run differently, respectful of each country's needs.

The main problem I'm having is how to select these representatives. An election seems too modern and clean of a method considering the nature of the Gora and Kevosi's cultures, so their decisions go unquestioned throughout the years as corruption sets in. 

Maybe something similar to the early Romans/Greek political system could work? I know they often held councils for the sake of politics but I'll admit I don't know much about that time period or its practices. 

**TL;DR: How do you reasonably select members of a new city's council when ruling by committee is a new concept to an area predominantly ruled by monarchies?** 

Thanks in advance for any of your responses!

**EDIT** Wow thanks for all of the awesome advice everyone. You're bringing up a lot of things I didn't consider the first time around and I really think this will help me develop my world. For some extra background on the two countries involved in this I'll copy and paste a comment I made lower in the thread:

""The setting is a pretty standard medieval style story. If I had to place a date relative to earth's history I'd put it between 1200-1400. A bit of a stretch I know but I'm still hammering out the details as far as what technology is available. The two races are actually descendants of normal humans. In the past vanilla humans ruled the land before the majority of them were abducted by an outside force. The remaining humans scattered across the continent and lived through a dark age before the Gods discovered them.
Each of the two Gods picks a group of humans on opposite ends of the continent and blesses with the strengths that they value as deities.

One group

The Gora on the other hand get blessed to be stout and strong, etc.

So please go easy on the plagiarism with me. :P And since I'm not an avid reader

So here's my system:
Everyone can do magic

To give an example: If a mage would summon fire
So to optimize your firespells, for example, make a fire that burns through steel, leaves wounds that can't be healed, etc.

Because of this, there is a practice to study life with the intent to increase it's longevity. The truely skilled ones can do this to a point where they are considered ageless. As they cannot die from old age anymore(but can still be killed in combat).

Also

Magic can also be channeled through objects. This can be done through any object
The best effects are gained from objects like wands, arrows. Long things without much stuff protruding from it. The philosophy here is the same as with non-magic combat. 
The bigger the item

As for enchanting, since magic is needed to use the enchanted item.

Mana speaks for itself, whereas person 2 can only lift 140 pounds. Same with magic.

To elaborate on the children of mages if person 1 has only reached half of his limit when he has children and person 2 has reached 75% of his limit when he has children. The potential of person 2's children will be increased more percentually than person 1's children. That is why mages in my world often have children at a very late age (can be at hundreds of years

Magic can also be lethal to the user if he doesn't know his limits. If the mana pool of the mage runs dry

So new mages are obligated by law to have a more experienced mage overseeing their spells. When they have made significant progress and can use magic safely, since there is more to learn than one mage can learn in his life, even if he is ageless).

I hope you stuck with me till the end and forgive any spelling errors I made. English is not my primary language
I would love to hear your constructive criticism on my elaborate system.",,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/zyu5w/so_i_noticed_people_like_to_have_feedback_on/

He was nearing the object at the end of the dirt path, like he has every single night for the passed month. The web of light, that filled the space between him and the object, slowed him down as if it were real. He was glad, last time he had to avoid stone golems that wanted to use him as a chair. Inch by inch he edged closer to the now visible object, parting his way through, with his hands. As he got closer he could tell that it was a golden book placed upon a white marble pedestal

BOOM. Blinding white light now filled his vision as if a grenade exploding in his hands. He hoped maybe this time he would finish the dream and open the damned book that had been taunting him the past month. The light slowly dimmed. There was a face about an inch from his. His face was now usually warm and slimy. The light equalized and he could recognize, jump on his face and lick him awake. He would then try and sleep in a little more but Jasper wouldn’t allow such a luxury and spread cat saliva on his face like butter on toast. He pushed her aside and sat up like a robot staring at the clock, waiting for the siren that wasn’t built in as the alarm function. It was now 7:50am, Jasper stared at him from the corner of his room and put her paws to her ears which was odd for it seemed very human-like for a cat. 7:51am.

Magic within Lysthera takes the form of singing, but do not understand it fully and more often than not create abominations from their songs. The Kan’stinn are the only ones who truly understand the song, and even they did not discover it – in their own legends The Song was created by the union of the Heavens and the Seas, and is the most basic fundament of life. It can be used to sing almost anything into existence, living or not, but life cannot be sung out of the world – it can be destroyed with other songs, but no song exists to fully remove it. It can also summon into the world things that are mobile but not truly living, and those men who practise it often find themselves having greatly reduced lifespans.

1342469570.0,wntgg,King Darius Solace: What do you think of my antagonist and his motives?,Dimanagul,6,1,7,"He's not a clear factor in the first book

----

Four pieces of supplementary data:

•	A Library in my novel is someone that memorizes vast amounts of information. Paper is fairly scarce so it's a necessary method of record keeping.

•	A Dimanagul is someone from our world that has come to this one (Pange). While they don't have the capacity for magic they can 'cheat death' by returning to the last statue of the Goddess they visited.

•	A Managul that has no clear limitation on magical potential but is still bound by normal rules of capacity. Eg. Can use all forms of magic when people typically can only use two.

•	Gelbane is the largest and most powerful country on the main continent of Pange. In the past 50 years they have had two major wars once against Erdak that ended in peculiar victory (a mysterious natural disaster that wiped out the Erdaki primary force) and once against Dendarg that led to a tactical defeat (smaller numbers but better trained fighters).

----

The King of Geldbane

His closest subordinates were two brothers that served as his bodyguard and enforcer. He dubbed them his sword and shield. Despite being somewhat heavy handed King Darius was fairly popular

The northern part of Erdak was left uninhabitable due to the aforementioned disaster but Darius offered fair pay to Erdaki willing to venture into their now poisonous nation to gather natural resources.
Darius learned the details of the Dimanagul at this time and used his resources to find and gain control of him. It didn't take long for him to discover it was a man named Clayton Cobb. Clayton was travelling with a woman named Beatriz Adakasin. Darius discovered she was none other than the Managul

----

Darius (around age 18) divided his time between trying to secure the Dimanagul and investigating reasons the Managul would want to seek him out. History had shown that Dimanagulus made habit of killing Managuls. They are their natural predators. However
Finally the truth became known when King Darius factored in an old prophecy that mentioned the relation of the fall of Geldbane and the Dimanagul. Clayton and his kin weren't aiming to destroy anything, had used the 'power' of the Dimanagul to cause the tragedy in Erdak and save his nation from being conquered in one fell swoop.

It was at that point he became obsessed with understanding everything there was to know about the Dimanagulus. He had no interest in the Managul as her threat was plain to see. As King he had greater interest in information than raw power. He viewed his father's 'use' of the Dimanagul as short sighted and planned to use his own much more intelligently.

Darius manipulates Clayton into thinking Beatriz was planning to bring about the prophetic end and tricks him into killing her (Despite Clayton and Beatriz developing real feelings for each other). While her motivations were selfish

Darius realizes the very real threat looms over Geldbane and it has degraded to a point where the very people that had assumed to be a threat now are the only means to stop it. The King
His father had been short sighted in his use of the Dimanagul. Darius would not make the same mistake. Once content with the information he could get from Clayton

----

Darius bides his time over the next ten years (Darius is now around 38), he would control the Managul (Zammela Glemeis) as well, and his rule would be absolute. He plans to returns to his rightful place on the throne as the hero that saved Geldbane and perhaps all of Pange.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/wntgg/king_darius_solace_what_do_you_think_of_my/

This is the second half of chapter 2; we started with a bang. Part 1 of chapter 2 got him free from suspicion of murder

There isn't a lot of conflict in this scene


----------


Dow led him to the manager's office

The fluorescents buzzed with a high whine that made him clench his teeth. Too bright, hearing the sound of his own dry eyes closing and opening, loud as a breaking neck. He focused on the buzzing instead. It almost helped.

Dow perched on the desk and waved him toward the seat. The chair rocked gently when he laid his hand on its back. His skin burred faintly.

""I'll stand

She shrugged. ""Where do you live

He told her most of the truth

""You're not under arrest

He could have refused. Another night

He left out the fact that Cory had killed Evan James Wright when she was twelve years old. Left out his suspicion that Conrad Ross was behind the dead man's return, he told her. About the girl who'd thought he was trying to pick her up, about Cory coming in, and how his relationship with her had ended badly, though he didn't say why. He told Dow that Cory had come in looking for him to help her, that he'd tried. And that he'd failed.

He didn't say *again* aloud but in his mind it was all he heard.

And then she led him through the story again, why he thought the man--or, if not a man, whatever he was--had come for Cory. He answered the same way every time. He didn't recognize the killer. He didn't know why Cory would be targeted. 

After what seemed like hours, at least done with him. Either would be good enough. The adrenaline and the alcohol had fled his system with the story, and he could barely keep his eyes open. He just wanted to go back--for a moment he almost thought *home* but then he remembered it was only Mercy's couch. Home enough, as long as he picked up a bottle on the way there. Drunk enough, he wouldn't feel a thing.

""You're free to go, sliding off the desk. And then, as he looked up from the floor, she slid the last question in like a dagger.  

""One more thing. You say you saw raw spellshadow coming off of the killer. Can you tell me about that?"" 

He was bleary

""What it looks like."" Something in her voice got his attention. He brought her face into focus with an effort

Hawk got that same cliff-edge sense he'd had when her spellrod had been trained on him. This was a different cliff, it wasn't an edge he wanted to topple over.

""It's nothing

She said nothing, inevitably. And they hated him enough lately, he didn't need to add police to the mix. 

Dow held her silence. Waited.

""I can't be the only one who can do it

She leaned forward. ""You're the only one I ever met. How?""

Hawk shrugged. ""I don't know what to tell you."" Which was true

""I'll be honest with you

This time, the hot flow of liquor burning toward his belly. Eventually, the numbness, spreading like balm.

Finally, Mr. Riggins. You have my card.""

He did, then he thought better and tucked it into his shirt pocket.

""I hope you're not planning any trips in the near future?""

He wasn't. Not that he wouldn't like to. But none of the five could leave the city. That was how the magic worked

""I'll be around

""Call me if you think of anything that might help. A woman is dead

Justice. For a dead man. Hawk wanted to laugh. Wanted to cry. 

Instead

The people were at sea.

They had never been at sea this long.

They had fought a war. They had lost.

They had run.

“Go!” Pelu had said

They had readied their women and children. They had put them in large canoes

They had pushed out to sea.

They did not look back.

There were stories of what they now did. There were stories of long ago. Pelu’s grandfather had told him his own grandfather’s story about such a voyage. Pelu’s grandfather had said that his grandfather had been but a boy when he was packed in a large canoe with many women and traveled the sea for days.

When they had landed

Pelu’s village was now burnt. His grandfather’s shine was broken.

Pelu rose to the crest of a wave and whistled shrilly.

He did this every time he came to the rest of a wave.

Each surviving man did.

If a man heard fewer than ten whistles between his own

The first days

They were too few to lose any more.

In the very beginning

One canoe had been tipped. Its man was barely saved from water. His canoe had been lost

They were too few to lose any more.

Pelu rode alone. He saw no other people, and waited.

There were more women than men. More children. They fit ten or more to a canoe. Their canoes had long floats to one side, one rode near the middle in a women’s canoe. Three whistles, a pattern easily heard. 

The other men fished.

To do this they had to stray from sight of the long canoes. To do this

This is why they whistled.

At night

One morning

There were too few to lose any more.

Pelu always slept at the head of the caravan. It was he who lead the people. Every night he notched the wooden float with his knife.

There were six notches in the float this morning.

There had been three when one man had not come to sleep with the others.

There had been none when a man was forced to ride with the women.

They were learning.

They had learned from the women that seaweed contained water they could drink.

They had learned from the women that sharp whistles carried better than voices.

They had learned from the women that long canoes could be lashed together

The women carried memories of the sea much older than the men. While the men had to train at hunting, the women told stories. Wives told daughters. Mothers told wives. Sisters told each other.

The women carried memories much older than all but a few men. Pelu had memories carried from his grandfather’s grandfather, from before the people had come to the island. Pelu had a memory from his grandfather’s grandfather’s father.

That memory had risen in him

Women carried many memories that could not be trusted. Their memories had no lineage. They did not think for themselves, or her sister, or mother, or husband’s mother, or grandmother, or a woman whose shrine was no longer remembered.

But but the women’s memories were the only memories of sea without visible land

The basic premise of my story is the fall of a great kingdom as seen through the eyes of a few POV characters over their entire lives.  This submission constitutes the opening of the story. The first part is a fragment of a historical chronicle written centuries after the main story (my idea is to start each chapter with a fake historical text). This is followed by the prologue, when the main protagonists are just children, and the narrative would gradually work back to the time of the prologue.

All comments are welcome. Feel free to be brutally honest.

""Little is known of the dark years between 860-880 of the Royal Era. The few surviving historical records of the era are fragmentary and difficult to interpret, and the entire land descended into anarchy. At least three armies fought for control the once-great kingdom until 880, when in the Battle of Dragon Cliffs, one of these forces, under the command of a man known only as the Spider General, won a decisive victory over the combined forces of the other two armies. Upon his triumph, he was crowned Supreme Emperor and ruled all of Berna for the next thirty years, and beginning the still-in-place Davinian Dynasty. Beyond this point

Prologue 

Winter

The three travelers stared over the ruins in silence

At the bottom of what was once a huge staircase sat a small mound of dirt. The entire area was littered with similar graves, and dropped a small ivory ornament onto the grave, by the hilt of the sword.

“Who was this person?” Asked the second traveler. But the first traveler said nothing

They gathered around the campfire eating the remains of their rations, never looking up. The fire brought out the dark shadows under his wrinkled eyes, eyes that had witnessed much over the years. In the flickers of the fire, he saw the faces of men and women who had long since passed away. Finally, he began to speak, hesitantly at first, but with increasing confidence as he went along.

“I’ll tell the story. This is a long one, and heroes still roamed the face of the earth. I will tell you of the fall of the Great King, and of the three forces that marched to their doom at the Dragon Cliffs. I will tell of a wandering swordsman and his tragic friendship with the man would eventually become the treacherous Spider General... ”

The cold, blew through the small canyon where he had set up his camp. He sat on the thick branches of a tree, his back pressed against the rough bark of the trunk. A small fire flickered beneath him, providing a meagre source of heat as the flames struggled to stay alive in the wind. Staring down into the light, Altair wished he could stir up a larger fire to keep warm, but then discarded the thought as quickly as it had appeared. He felt at home in the cold – his element was the ice. He felt as comfortable in a windstorm as the King on his throne. The only reason elected to make camp was because of the distance to the nearest town and the severity of the temperature. While he enjoyed the cold, he knew his limits


Leaves violently rustled as a strong gust flew down the canyon. Even the trunk of the tree, but certainly not a rare event. In the past month, there had been six separate storms, each one stronger than the last. Altair only hoped that the winter had decided to go out with a bang; it was long past the time for warmer temperatures to come to Hadar. He would miss the crisp air of winter, but his job was much easier in the spring. 


Looking up from the fire, and slightly to the left of his perch. It looked as if it had needles sticking out of its side. Waiting for the next gust to come, he flexed his fingers and relaxed, concentrating on the space around himself. With the silence of the mountains around him, he was quickly able to make the connection. The world near him shifted within his mind, and he could sense an energy coming from everything around him – the tree, the dirt, and even the mountains. It all crackled with magical energy. Most of the connections were dull, pulsated with stronger energies. The most powerful force was distant, he let his own magic flow. It appeared as a small spark of silver light in his palm


A few short seconds passed before the next blast of wind hit him. Gripping the ice, letting the wind take it. Twisting with the wind, the shard curved to the left and pierced the side of the smaller tree, standing straight next to the dozen other ice shards embedded in the trunk. Altair sighed when he looked at the number of shards he had created compared to the time he had been sitting here - too few for too long. At least he was still accurate. 


Craning his neck to look up at the night sky flecked with stars, wandering from town to town with his few belongings and no desire to stay in one place, watching the people around him cower over a meaningless war, and letting his magic abilities fall into slump. No, not a slump, a gorge; an endless gorge that no one else was going to help him out of.


Altair flexed his fingers again as he stared at the stars. Holding his hand up in front of himself, and past the sky. He could feel a faint pull at the edge of his magical vision when he looked at the stars. It should be impossible – if he couldn’t reach the snow on the mountains, he shouldn’t be able to reach the stars. But when he cleared his mind and reached....


*Pop!* The faint sound could have come from a burning ember in the fire below him, but had no practical use other than a little source of light. 


*Impressive and pretty


That piece of advice had always confused him. As a boy he marvelled over the idea of touching what he thought was a star, so it must just be very hot flames. Now he was apathetic. Altair appreciated that no one else seemed to be able to do this, it still had no purpose for him. Maybe he could use it to impress girls. 


Rolling his eyes, and he could do with some sleep. He needed to be rested for the journey tomorrow. As he tried to sleep, he contemplated his route. Could he make it all the way to the capital, or should he try for one of the smaller, but closer villages? Wherever he went, he had to find a job, preferably not for the Zaurak


The night dragged on as Altair drifted in the foggy world halfway between waking and sleep. ",,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1jubnt/critique_request_this_is_an_excerpt_from_my_story/

""- How are you feeling? – Aithinne asked me with her honey voice.
- I... – I coughed up some more water. – I’ve been better.
- Get him into my tent. I need to examine him.
I was shocked. It had been some time since I was examined by a woman.
Two strong men appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me by the shoulders. I could walk on my own, as the tribes of Rah’adje were nomads and didn’t carry such luxuries around. Around the yurt, servants were standing ready to obey their Elder’s commands.
The men dropped me on one of the pillows and went outside. Aithinne came in and stood in front of me. She was looking at me

I've recently started actually writing my series after spending the last 6 years off and on crafting the universe, and two original races (I hope) that I have crafted. So here's my dilemma: dwarves. I like dwarves, but I don't have a place for them in my universe except as a flimsy plot device, so I've been toying with not having them in at all. And I guess I'm having this feeling that since I have all the other traditional fantasy aspects, I feel odd about leaving dwarves out. 

TL;DR: with elves, etc. Should I be worried about excluding dwarves simply because they're expected in a fantasy universe.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,
