The case is that my classmate is going to be deported from Iceland after next weekend after a struggle with The Directorate of Immigration. She came here to work as an Au-Pair in Vogar but she started attending college at Keilir's University Bridge at Keflavik Airport last semester and has exceeded everything that is to be expected from a student. She is even giving the other students extra lectures and has shown extremely outstanding results in maths and physics.

During her stay in Iceland she has lost her father and one of her brother. Her mother has sold her into forced mariage so what she's facing after her arrival in Nepal is what we in the western world would call slavery.

The Directorate of Immigration's interpretation of a passive-agressive email sent to her from her brother and their definition of the situation in Nepal was the main reason for the rejection of her application for a humanitarian residence permit. –So instead of looking at her situation (she has already been sold into marriage) and the potential effects on her future they used some generic statistics and draconian understanding of the law and the exhibits used.

These are the chances she has left before being deported:

* Reversal of the decision from The Directorate of Immigration itself
* Reversal from the Minister of Internal Affairs
* Citizenship from the Parliament

What we

She, Fréttablaðið and other media but we can't allow her case to disappear when other issues like Icesave start rolling out this week.

We need you to stay interested in the case, call your friends and put pressure on the politicians you know. We need as much interest and attention on this case as possible.

**Edit:** UTL has decided to re-valuate the case. This means that the application will be reevaluated. [Also,False,self,t5_2qigc,True,,,t3_ghzsq

Hann tók bara ansi vel í hugmyndina og í dag er ég búinn að eyða rétt rúmum 40 tímum í lögreglubíl - Og sakaskráin er ennþá tandurhrein!

I travelled to Iceland last year and spent some time travelling around the country. I partied with some of you in Reykjavik, bathed in the hotsprings near ~~Fjallagrasa~~ Myvatn; I made some young friends and shared a few laughs over a burger at Aktu Taktu, swapped stories with a boisterous bartender/owner named Gregor in Dalvik, and nearly fell in love with a beautiful young woman in Akureyri. 

I miss the black sand beaches, and the delicate flavour of puffin. I miss the sweet light flavour of shrimp cake/sandwich, the smooth smoky flavour of Hangikjöt. I miss the delightful blends at Microbar, and the bitter freshness of Fjallagrasa schnapps. I miss the homely feeling of waiting in line outside while the rain drizzles down at the famous stand in Reyjkavik, waiting for a delicious Pylsur with everything on it. 

My heart is aching, and I will see you again someday. ",,False,self,t5_2qigc,1363798010.0,,

There have been many posts on this subreddit about this group. All of them on trolling them. But I just want this hateful group gone. The group is called ""[Mótmælum mosku á Íslandi](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mótmælum-mosku-á-Íslandi/134937909889448)"" which would translate as something along the line ""Protest mosque in Iceland"".

There is nothing wrong with protesting. I don't care if you're protesting stupid things. It's when you start using hate speech then I think you have crossed the line. I didn't think the title itself was offensive

Most of the posts on the wall of this group is about how evil Muslims are. That they are terrorists, take over the world,  and the usual Andre Brevik propaganda/fear mongering.

There was even a [news article](http://www.pressan.is/frettir/lesafrett/grafa-svin-og-blod-i-jordu-til-ad-vanhelga-og-hindra-mosku-i-reykjavik---glaesilegt-their-eru-thjodhetjur) about people associated with that group that where burrowing pig carcasses and blood in the ground to desecrate it so Muslims wont building on it.

1361487246.0,18zfbd,Now maybe I'm just over romanticizing what is essentially a nation of fishermen and sheep farmers,intravenus_de_milo,50,11,15,". . . but I spent the last 2 weeks visiting the lovely nation of Iceland

Let me back up here a second.  One of the questions I got from an Icelander over a few beers is why on earth an American would be interested in visiting Iceland in the first place – his logic being, which is quite correct.  A 10 hour tour around Iceland from car is like weeks of driving by car in the United States.  

I never really got around to answering his question, and Alaska is far too cold this time of year.

But it reminded me of a notion I heard from a Canadian on the nature of what Americans are which I think is quite correct.  America is not a geographic location, the Declaration of Independence,  and the Founding Fathers, you're an American, and it has very little to do with your cultural background, geographic location, language, quintessentially

As I was driving away from  Þingvellir, like a founding document, like a Deceleration of Independence, defines the nation, people, and the geography into a contiguous whole, which made me feel a sort of profound respect for where I was and how where I was is written into the rocks themselves. 

It's not like, and it seems to reflect an independence from authority that any American could respect – respites of fealty to kings aside, the entire island, people, culture, and geography is fervently independent from any worldly authority.   

There's something about eeking out a living on that land, and I'm glad I got to visit.

Some tips / thoughts:

1) I went with 6 other guys. We rented a van. It was a very good decision. From the airport, relaxing, and enjoyable time (there is a swim up bar there).

2) I stayed at the Centrehotel Plaza. It was in a perfect location. The rooms are a bit small but the staff there are spectacular. They helped us out with any questions we had

3) The Golden Circle Tour. The benefits of your own transportation here is incredible. We did the entire tour in about 3.5 hours whereas some of the guided tours take longer. Its a scenic scenic route. The greatest thing here was the natural geyser that is fun to watch (we stayed around and watched it 4 times - you have to see it to understand why its fun to watch).  The waterfall was ridiculous and one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in my life

4) I went whale watching. We saw minke whales, and a colony of puffins. To go whale watching, just walk to the harbor and there are many many tours that do this. I only went on one but I think they are all similar. The one we went on had its own bar which added to fun. I wanted to go angling but didn't have time.

5) The food: We didn't really get crazy with food except for the Fish Mark which I'd highly recommend. There are quite a few seafood places   but we also went to a delicious pizza place up the main strip.  I never tried the hot dog because each night I would end up at the food stand in front of our hotel (I can't find the name of the place). There was a long line Friday and Saturday night and its well worth it. 

6) The nightlife: Ridiculous. At this time in the year (June) it really never gets dark. I found the highly recommended place B5

At least in Reykjavik, looking strange, asking for directions or suggestions. And you didn't give us the greeting I'd expect from my home town, NYC. No ""ughs"" or rolls of the eyes, no ""download an app on your phone"", no running away quickly. You guys stayed, chatted briefly, and sent us on our way.

I also really wanted to ask all the people running around the other day as Superman/Superwoman what they were up to

I didn't get to do much, while here. I got to try some food, to listen to some music, take the Golden Circle tour, go to the flea market, and go to some museums.

I'd really have loved to be able to go visit the volcanoes sometime, especially in the winter. I'd also love to learn Icelandic, as my stumbling with a book, the online course, and a few youtube videos has left me basically clueless. Coming here I knew a few words and (crappy) pronunciation of them, but it still helped a lot, even if it lead me to call ""Bankastræti"" by its English translation, which now my parent uses as the only name for it.

Your weather this time of year... or at least, mulling around 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Your air is much cleaner here, and my joints hurt a lot less, sans trip to any heated pool.

If you saw me today (unlikely

Ég er 23 ár gamall strákur frá Noregi sem er mjög til í að fá mér eitthvað sumarstarf i 2013. Ég er með BS i hagfræði frá Haskolanum í Bergen(Björgvin?), reddit og nokkrar aðeins einnfaldrar bækur (erfiðari en Jón Bjarni og bróðir hans, léttari enn Islandsklukkan).


Ég er buinn að tala við nokrar  ""family friends"" (fjöldskildar vinir?) um starf eins og í Landsbanki


Ég hef starfað sem bartjónn, yfir alt, enn frekar í Reykjavik (eða höfuðborgarsvæðið, ekkert mál að taka strætó!).

##Ensku:
Hi, and I am currently undergoing a masters program at the University of Oslo. I went to the University of Iceland for a semester during my bachelors degree, where all teaching was in Icelandic, mostly in math, and I am half Icelandic and this speak enough Icelandic to read books, newspaper and some simpler books (i.e. more advanced than Jon Bjarni and his brother that I can't remember the name of but less advanced than Islandsklukkan/Iceland's bell. I was able to read ""englar alheimsins""  with just some help from the dictionary.

I have been speaking with some family friends about getting a job in banks or in the public sector in economics, to see if anybody here would have some cool/smart ideas.

My professional experience is mostly in customer service, barista, waiter, one year in the army and as a (cocktail) bartender. I am open to everything, but preferably in Reykjavik or close by as I have cheap accommodation there and I don't have the fear of the buses as many of  my co-students seemed to have. 

I could have written a lot better Icelandic by using resources such as islex.hi.is, with little accent, just horrendous grammar. When I was last in Iceland, a girl told me in Icelandic to ""Viltu hættu að tala svona fáranlegur islensku!"" which is one of the nicer complements I have ever received.

Can we afford to stay in Reykjavik for 7-10 days and take some day tours (golden circle, Gullfoss, etc)? Here's an example of the tours I'm looking at http://www.iceland4you.is/eng/catalog/.

There is a new app for both Android and iOS that you should consider installing if you are planning to travel within Iceland.
It will send your GPS location before calling the emergency number 112 (equivalent to 911 (US) and 999 (UK)). 
There is also an 'check-in' feature where you can leave a trail of where you are.

Sadly there are deaths almost every year in Iceland because of people getting lost in the wilderness.  Often they manage to call for help but don't know where they are.
(look for ""ferðamaður týndur"" (without the quotes) and google translate if you have doubts).

I'm doing a project for school that has some questions regarding social norms in Iceland. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in helping me out. I could do tons of research on the internet

Thanks a million in advance


Behaviour    
1. Are there any social behaviours when conversing that would seem strange to North Americans?    
2. How do you perceive things such as public touching? Holding hands? Public displays of affection
3. Are there any age issues?    
   
   
Diet    
1. Delicacies and standard Icelandic diet.    
2. Dining etiquette.   


Family Values   
1. Are there standard gender roles in Iceland? Male/Female   
2. Do specific family members often have specific responsibilities?   
3. Standard concept of beauty.   
  
  
Slang  
1. Do you have any common phrases that would seem out of place to someone visiting your country?  


Music  
1. What is popular in Iceland?  
2. Do you have any traditional music? Is it something that you would actually listen to


Sports  
1. Favourite sports/pastimes  


Taboos
1. Any gestures or phrases that would get a tourist in trouble?
2. Anything else considered offensive/improper?


Youth Culture

My brother, he just stopped answering phone calls and emails.  I have no idea what happened or why he stopped talking to us, but as of our last communication with him he was in reykjavik. 

I don't think he died

The lady who manages his storage unit saw him last October and told my mom that when he came to pay his bill

I found a couple myspace posts he made and he was posting song lyrics to famous songs claiming he had written them. He unfriended his family of facebook but a few of our mutual friends he stayed linked to showed me some of his posts and they're rambling, claims he invented everyday objects, just totally crazy stuff.  All his friends commented on all his posts asking him if he was ok, what's going on, but he didn't answer anyone. He stopped posting altogether on all media sites around April of this year.

He has been living in reykjavik for the last year and a half

If I had the money I'd fly out there myself and post flyers and tear the town up. I've tried contacting the police and the american embassy but since he's not legally missing they can't or won't give me any information. 

What makes this situation especially dire is that my mom was recently diagnosed with stage 3 Ovarian cancer. She has about a 50% chance to live and every day asks about my brother. We all miss him and worry about him and want to know that he's ok. 

His name is Shane Flaten,7"" with long brown hair (usually messy) and blue eyes. I've linked a picture.  He might try and tell you he's a commodities broker.  

Please

My father is unknown so I’d use a matronymic; I guess an approximation of mom’s “Josiane” could be “Jóhanna” (and boy Icelandic names are just great!)

I'm a Norwegian

The amount of money I'm making freelancing is pretty good. it is a lot in El Salvador it would even be quite decent in the U.S (where my Girlfriend is from) but in Norway it would be quite a lot less.
I've gotten used to not having to worry too much about money, but would still like to make a living with my freelance art.

It was actually my girlfriend that mentioned Iceland today after having watched an episode of House Hunters International (a television program about people buying houses in different places of the world) So it made me start wondering. 

**Questions**

* What is the cost of living? (compared to Norway perhaps(if anyone knows))
Not quite sure how this could be determined. But perhaps: a carton of milk

* Would it even be possible for me to be self-employed in Iceland

* Does Iceland have Added value tax on electronic wares and/or services?

* Anyone perhaps already gone through this and has some advice?

Guess I didn't have too many questions. Although more may come I suppose. I appreciate any help on these subjects. I'll continue my google searches. But would be good to set up a dialogue with someone. Thanks for reading.

Markmiðið er að búa til frjálsa orðabók sem virkar beint úr kassanum á OpenOffice og öðrum kerfum sem nota Hunspell-kerfið fyrir leiðréttingar en þar má m.a. nefna Firefox, en það er bara til að auðvelda þróunina á málfræðikerfinu sem keyrir á bakvið.

Planið er að byggja orðabókina upp á einföldum ""grunnorðum""; s.s. nafnorðum í eintölu-nefnifalli

    ==Nördaskapur endar==

Málið er að þetta er ekki eins manns verk og kemur til með að taka ansi langan tíma og mun valda ansi miklum höfuðverkjum fyrir þá sem koma til með að taka þátt m.a. vegna þess að svona verk hefur ekki verið unnið fyrir íslensku áður (fyrir utan Púka) og að það er ekki beinlínis allt fljótandi í handbókum og hjálp á netinu um þessi mál (opinberi póstlistinn fyrir Hunspell er t.d. dauður en tungumálahópurinn hjá OpenOffice.org er sem betur fer lifandi.

Hvar mælir fólk með því að maður sæki um styrki og slíkt í svona verk?

We booked our trip through Icelandair, leaving 2 full days and 2 half days (our arrival flight lands early in the morning, and our departure leaves at night) for fun. So:

1) I've noticed through looking at booking packages online that prices are often listed in EU as well as ISK. Should we bring both forms of currency

2) We have 3 vegetarians and 1 gluten-allergy in our party

3) We're all in our early 20s and as such want to experience some nightlife

4) We've been reading about the Blue Lagoon and definitely want to spend some time at a hot spring

5) I'm fascinated by Icelandic art

6) What's the deal with the Icelandic Elf School? I've seen it mentioned many times online but have yet to find any booking information.

Thanks for reading! Great answers so far

Edit: Whale watching! What's the deal? I'm a bit more interested in seeing puffins

I say ""supposed to"" because we got a call this morning to say our first flight

The worst part is that if we knew there was no way to reschedule we could have driven from Cincinnati to JFK and made our flight to Iceland.  However

If that was all I'd be upset but it gets more complex.  We were going to be driving the ring road so we had reservations at places around the whole country.  We now need to start our trip later so all those reservations need to be changed.  I don't know if that is even possible.  We were working through a place that did the booking for us and they aren't sure if they can pull it off.  Our plan to drive the ring road may be destroyed and it may cost us a huge amount of money to change everything.  

I still hope that I can salvage our trip but right now I'm very depressed.  ",self,t5_2qigc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Iceland/comments/y0iff/the_airline_has_completely_fouled_up_my_trip_to/

I don't see a lot of things for this for non-icelandic speakers as everything I can find on reddit is to tourists. who want to do touristy things.  I'm more interested in Living Iceland.

Language:  I am learning all the Icelandic I can and while I know its unreasonable to think I will be fluent in a week

Phone: Bought a ""throw away"" Icelandic phone with Kr. so I have a local number for the week in case of emergencies

Cloths: I brought stuff that was not up to the task (including a hat that the wind LOVES to pull off my head) so I did a little shopping and have fixed that by simply looking around at the mall area nearby and seeing what the locals speaking Icelandic wear.  That and a nice chat with a nice looking women - not that this is saying much

Food: I ate a very light breakfast that seemed pretty standard for America in the hotel after the international flight in this morning, including some ""Harofiskur"".. but I dont think I could make a meal out of it.  My hotel doesn't give me a Kitchen area and they are all full so I don't have the option of upgrading to cook, sadly.

Drink: I did the booze and bags shuffle from the duty free when I landed.  I had read a lot about it

Companionship:  I don't know anybody and I have no idea where people go to meet new people.  I would love to sit and drink

Plans: I have the usual touristy places planned out near the end of the trip

Any assistance or advice is welcome.  I hate being lonely in a new country and I figure the best way to not feel like awkward american is to just dive in.

I'm really interested in going to the swimming pools, in public locker rooms before entering the pool.  I don't have that much experience with public nudity, but I'm just going to roll with it.  My question is, can someone break down exactly what to do when going to one of these public swimming pools?   For example, where do you take off your shoes?  In the locker room, or outside somewhere?  Are you expected to carry a lock for the locker?  Is there soap/shampoo/conditioner already in the showers, or do you bring your own (the reason I ask this is that I saw a mention of the Blue Lagoon telling people to put conditioner in their hair and leave it in while in the pool - I didn't know if that was done everywhere, in the US, etc - and claiming a couple of chairs and maybe a small table with all of our stuff.

of how it works
features of loan repayments and interbank lending are included.
Finally there will be a discussion of what may have gone wrong with
the Icelandic implementation of the system.

* There were eight of them

* They live somewhere in the north of Iceland.

* Some of them work in a hospital or something like that.  They often rotate between working in Reykjavik and staying at their country house up north.  Some of them also sometimes work on a fishing boat of some kind.

* The only two names he remembers at all--and he knows he's getting them wrong--are ""Sevelia"" and ""Valeria.""  I've even done some looking through lists of Icelandic first names to try to reconstruct what the names really are, we speak American English, he has even less experience with foreign language than I do, and neither of us has any experience at all with Icelandic...so this is more of a less-than-half-educated guess than anything else.

* His friends know a musician.

* In 1783 the volcanic system of Laki erupted. It lasted for 8 months. It resulted in the deaths of ~10.000 people (or about 20%)
