I guess I'll answer the obvious stuff first.

1.) Why did you ever support radical feminism?

In large part because I was disillusioned by mainstream feminism's lack of concern for prostituted women and women forced into the porn industry via human trafficking. I was led to believe that it was the only strain of feminism or humanitarianism that took action against this. But another huge reason: I'm a survivor of abuse by a male relative. It was easy to convince me that all men are inherently predators because I was betrayed by a father figure. I believe that many radical feminists are survivors of abuse and assault by men

2.) Did you hate men?

Yes and no. Yes, too, and women also commit horrible crimes, but according to radical feminism women are *always* the victim in this world. 

But at the same time I did not hate men. I held a peculiar kind of cognitive dissonance that I think is common among radical feminists. You love your male friends and family that have not harmed you, and there's a sense of solidarity against men amongst lesbian radical feminists, even where none truly exists. Radical feminists are prone to paranoia and even turn on each other. A lot. Paranoia and irrational hatred drives radical feminism. 

3.) What made you leave? 

In a nutshell

4.) Why did you make this thread?

To share my story

5.) How can I help a radical feminist see the light? 

Be gentle with them. Just like any exclusionary ideology, however, are bigots and not worth engaging IMO. I hope they will figure it out for themselves.

In conclusion: I hope this is helpful and in the right subreddit. Please ask me anything

 What has happened to our society that we've equated 'bad words' with actual oppression? When gay people aren't allowed to marry, that is *actual* oppression. If someone says I should go die, unless they actually plan on making that happen, I can just shrug it off and move on. Have we gotten so PC as a culture that we equate hurt feelings with actual oppression? Don't we have more important things to worry about? The people actually responsible for real, systematic oppression of minorities don't give a **(trigger word: sexual language)** fuck about hurt feelings. So why has the focus of social activism shifted away from actually trying to get people equal rights and protections under the law, towards making sure no one's feel feels are hurt? There are bigger things at stake then my emotions, and it especially is irritating when all these TSJWs claim to be speaking for me. They don't speak for me.

People who describe themselves as multiple systems (also known as multiples, alts, and many other names) take the idea of headmates one step further by believing that they actually have multiple people who make up their multiple personalities. So a person who describes themselves as a multiple system will likely refer to themselves as ""they"" because they believe they are multiple people. When they are acting as the personality of one of their headmates, they call this ""fronting"".

And, otherkin people, and, of course, fictional characters. Insane enough yet? No? Well you're in luck, because I've not even got to the people who believe they have galaxies, nebulae, and other space shit

**Transethnic/transabled**

People who describe themselves as transethnic believe they are a person of different ethnicity to their actual ethnicity living inside their body. So

Transabled people claim the same thing but with disabilities. So someone with perfect vision may claim they're actually a blind person living inside a normal person's body.

**Demisexual/skoliosexual/lithromantic/and other made up orientations**

Ever on the prowl for ways to make themselves seem cool and different

Defining all of these would take up a whole post in itself

* Demisexual means that you are only sexually attracted to people once you have an emotional connection to them.
* Skoliosexual means
* Lithromantic means you enjoy loving someone but not having those feelings returned. [It has its own Tumblr

**Cisgender**

The term cisgender, which brings me nicely onto...

**Made up privilege and oppression**

The favourite passtime for SJAs is to pretend they're oppressed, is another concept made up by SJAs. Those who are apparently ""oppressed"" have less privilege than those who aren't. Whoever has less privilege wins the Oppression Olympics!

This attitude is also used in more legitimate movements such as **feminism**. A great deal of Tumblr users have hijacked feminism and used it to claim all women are victims and all men are oppressors. You will see many examples of this in Tumblr feminist blogs

Not that this would matter much, whitey!"" or a relevant equivalent.

A lot of people are probably eager to tell me that all it “really"" means is that some people have inherent advantages because of certain attributes they have

The problem with the refrain that “some people have inherent advantages"" is that “some people"" are really “everyone"". Yes, but there are also benefits. This is a fact of life, not a fact of life that needs to be (or even can be) eradicated.

I once read someone who wrote that everyone accepts that there are people who are underprivileged

Make no mistake; someone who tells people to “check their privilege"" is not merely trying to make people more “aware"" of yadda-yadda-yadda. This is the mantra of an ideology that attempts to separate people into two groups: people who have “privilege""

When you make an argument or express your opinion, because you’re the enemy. You’re the oppressor, and you don’t get to have an opinion. Unless, of course, you completely and unequivocally agree with them, in which case they might decide to be so generous as to grant you the right to an opinion.",,self,,

&gt; **Privilege-splaining**: It may seem that we are biased in favor of oppressed groups. The reality is we're revoking the bias in favor of privileged groups that has become so normalized as to be invisible. The phrase ""check your privilege"" (or similar) is not an invitation to explain at even greater length than you've already done that you don't have privilege and are simply right. This behavior will be met with mockery and moderator action up to and including banning.

&gt; There is one thread here about veteran activists but most of what little I've seen seems to actually be exclusionary of older people. Most likely this is not intentional and probably stems from the same privilege blindness that afflicts us about other issues.

[""transophobic language""](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=445)

&gt; just a quick note to everyone: I've seen in a number of threads phrases like ""everyone with a penis"" being used to mean men. please watch your language, penises, boobs, and other things that have nothing to do with gender identity, and thus exclude trans, intersex, CAIS, ok?

But that's not all! [There is special subset of rules for dealing with being ""called out"" for your privileged perspective](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1216&amp;sid=92bfeb93af24272b83278d7ca8516353#p16283): 

&gt; 1\. Don’t tone police. It is NOT your right to dictate how someone should react to their oppression.

&gt; 2\. Don’t demand a detailed explanation. You’re basically asking the person to justify their call out. It’s exhausting, start an argument, or discredit the other person.

&gt; 6\. Don’t assume the person calling you out is just “looking to get offended”. Nobody enjoys calling other people out. To call someone out

You're all in violation of this one

&gt; 12\. LISTEN.

&gt; 13\. Genuinely apologize.

&gt; 14\. Work on oppression reduction and being the best ally you can be. The point of calling you out is to draw your attention to how you’re being oppressive, but the good thing is that we can identify these things in ourselves and change. And then we can start working on dismantling the kyriarchy, yeah!

This is not satire. Your jokes reveal your impure thoughts.

All of these people have one thing in common: Their lives and identities are based around one thing. Feminism, what they spend the majority of their time doing.

These people are incredibly boring. They make their entire life about a single thing, to set them apart from others as someone who matters.

And this holds true for so many people alive today. Guys who talk about nothing but the girls they fucked, hipsters, girls who can't help but talk about how they like women too and that they've sucked a billion dicks.

Society tells us that boring people are undesirable. Not only that, and not important. And people cope with this idea by coming up with whatever they can to make themselves interesting and important, even if they are just the opposite.

I am friends with some size-acceptance people on facebook because I used to be fat, I couldn't screencap it and post it here.

But basically

The lead fatty started the hate-brigade

The whole fucking thing pissed me off

**Of all the ""Social Justice Warriors"" on the internet

Eat less pizza, and learn to recognize the fact that you are *choosing* to be fat, therefore you are owed jack-fucking-shit! No one should have to pander to your preferences and kowtow to the fact that you have made yourself a pariah! The media makes people hate you? No! **YOU** make people hate you!

As a disclaimer

It pisses me off.

The end.

From defending the job of a functionally-illiterate woman because she was a person of color (a functionally-illiterate person working as a reporter for a newspaper, to very nearly being fired because she refused to bathe (and threatening legal action because of it), the list goes on.

But it's not all just silly stories. After spending that much time with her and her friends, as my experience is still limited, and I can't claim to speak for all of them.

So

Edit: A little info on this woman. She was lower middleclass, severely overweight, and very passionate about rape culture, cultural appropriation, and fatphobia/thinprivilege. She was also very mad about cultural expectations of women, and so did not shave or bathe with any frequency. She had a wispy but rather long chin beard, very puffy armpit hair, loose flowing and nonrestrictive dress). She was also vegan

Edit2: Thanks for all the great questions and discussion! I have to step out for a bit for an interview (a journalist is always on the clock) but keep asking questions and opening up discussion and I'll be back in an hour or two to answer more!

There are a lot of disabled people in the world who should be enraged at this shit but I'm going to mention one in particular.

I have a cousin who has FOP. Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva. What this means is ""your body gradually replaces every fucking muscle you have with bone and traps you in your own goddamn skin so you can't move."" On top of that, and amputated her right arm and shoulder. She happens to be right handed. Oh, and surgery is about the worst goddamn thing you can do to someone with FOP. She currently uses a wheelchair most of the time, but can walk laboriously with a cane, and barely has use of her other arm. 

However, and how happy she is for what she has. She spends all of her time raising money and fighting for a cure that she will probably never live to see. I have not ever once heard her bitch about anything and what really got me was her Christmas wish, quoted below.

""I wish there was some give room between my arm and side .. Due to the FOP my one arm is stuck glued to my side from the elbow to shoulder .. I can only wear thin type tops .. Ugh :( .. Ok that is all .. #wishesicouldwearcuterclothesfortheholiday""

That's the closest thing to a complaint I've ever seen out of her.

And then today I hear about this transabled bullshit and I just had to bitch. Sorry if this is the wrong place, or a past drug addiction, or any other stupid, self-indulgent whiny first world bullshit like that, or when i don't want to leave the house because I'm in a bad mood (bawwwww), I try to think of her. These transbullshit people should be ashamed.

Source of transabled word that I heard: x-trung.tumblr.com 

EDIT: shit I could claim if I gave a fuck:developmentally disabled Demi-bisexual rape survivor addict anorexic. But I don't give a fuck. I like being mocked. It keeps me in line and means people accept you.

EDIT 2: I forgot non-white Jewish.

I've had a Tumblr for going on four years now. My family's pretty liberal so when I saw the SJ scene pop up more and more I decided to look into it, oh. This is dumb. Some things:

* Tumblr SJ made me afraid of men. I didn't notice it so much until after I broke away from the mindset
* Reddit made me not afraid of men. I've read through a lot of different subs on here like /r/mensrights and /r/askmen and it opened my eyes to how silly I was being.
* White, 18 Y/O girl. I was the poster child for the Tumblr SJ movement.
* Since leaving Tumblr and joining Reddit I have changed my major from Women's Studies because I realized from Reddit how useless that was.

Yeah so basically ask me whatever you want! I'm not sure how to provide proof since I'm not comfortable releasing my blog with my personal information on it. But I voted for Obama and I annoyed most of my friends

*Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)*

Since the aflux of newcommers


""This is Poe"" doesn't mean it is fake. ""This is Poe"" means you can't tell if it's fake or not. ""I call Poe"" doesn't mean that you think it's fake; it means that you can't tell if it's fake or not. ""I'm pretty sure it's Poe"" means nothing.


Are you sure that something is fake? Then say it's fake. That something is legit? Then say it's legit. Can't tell? Call Poe.

I graduated from my dear high school this past year, residential area, which was great in itself - especially during Minnesota's allowance of same-sex marriage- however all great things can be taken too far.

Actions of note include a 'racial integrity/equality' room, right?

Additionally, upon discovering that she did not support same sex marriage. While I don't agree with that teacher's thoughts, she did not let it interfere with her students' education, and had no bearing on her as a professional.

**Edit for more stories!**

* This was the only high school to take part in an event called Take Back The Night, which was great. Not as great, was the event's return this past year. During an assembly, a video was shown which discussed sexual violence for around 5 minutes. The second that the narrators started discussing violence towards males, the video was shut off, and two male sport captains were required to take to the stage and ask the male audience members to raise their hand if they disagreed with sexual assault. Because all men are rapists until asked otherwise. Additionally, all the advertisements contained images which would lead one to believe only women are raped. I feel as though if you're raising awareness for an issue, not just one gender's misfortunes.

I feel we can really make a difference if we each donate just a little bit. And hey

My thoughts are that it should be a mental health charity because most of what we do is make fun of people we deem ""crazy"". But maybe you'd prefer if it was a gay rights charity? Or something else entirely?

I want to get everyone involved in this. We will decide together what charity to donate to and we will all donate a little money each. We might even try and encourage other people we know (either online or in real life) to do the same. If even a small portion of people who visit us donate $5 we can make a real difference here.

So the purpose of this thread is to plan our campaign.

We will decide:

1) What charity to donate to.

2) If/how we will get as many people on board as possible.

3) Pat each other on the back for actually making a positive difference in the real world.

I'm not saying you guys are dumb or stupid

* Assault - Putting someone in fear of immediate danger. Example: Pulling out a knife and saying ""I'm going to cut you shitlord!""

* Battery - Inflicting actual physical harm on another person

And again

edit: I forgot to add that you can't be charged with ""Assault and battery"". You **can** be charged with them as two seperate crimes though. 

edit2: Thanks to /u/Mukake for this detailed explanation:

So assault and battery are different depending on the jurisdiction as well. Because of this

* Aggravated Assault: Use of a weapon and/or aggravated injuries

* Simple Assault: No weapons and no serious injuries

* Intimidation: Implying you have a weapon and/or making other threats

******Wall of text warning!******

Like most people, surrounding yourself with people who simply reinforce your own opinions can lead to some... unique ideas that are generally not reflected in the rest of society.

Over the course of my life I have interacted with what I would consider to be a fairly diverse selection of individuals from all walks of life

**Trans Issues:** I have known a handful of trans* individuals, or have lashed out against straight/cisgendered people just for being who they are. On the other hand, I've observed them having to endure a fairly harrowing emotional (and/or physical) process, mostly alone, and quietly put up with a lot of hostility from people who don't understand them (i.e., most people they have to interact with on a daily basis).

**Womens Issues:** I have known plenty of feminists,"" but simply care about womens rights, which is a legitimate issue. I have had a few rare experiences with getting an angry, self-righteous lecture from someone over a complete triviality (like opening a door for someone, which many people view as a common courtesy that they would extend to everyone, not just women). That is by far a vocal minority, though.

**Fat Activism:** I have known many overweight or obese people (God bless America). Of those that I have known well, and exactly 0% of them ever mentioned ""thin privilege,"" the concept of being transthin, or the idea that they are an oppressed minority deserving of a civil rights movement. I have listened to some of them complain about the shallowness of society and how they wish they could fit in better, but I think that's completely understandable.

**Veganism/Vegetarianism:** Of all the vegans and vegetarians I've known, but I see no reason to ever make that an issue, unless someone specifically asks about, say, the environmental impact of the meat industry. I have, a time or two, been compared to Hitler for eating meat; but again

**What Is This I Don't Even:** In real life, transethnicity, transautism, skoliosexuality, or other fake oppressed minorities. I have been accused of cultural appropriation for liking something of another culture exactly once. I have been told to ""check my privilege"" only a handful of times. I have literally heard more angry rants about the role of moist towelettes in society than I have heard angry rants about the kyriarchy (3 to 2, to be exact).

George Takei is Japanese-American. He was a child during WWII. In WWII, sent to an internment camp, and he has faced racism for being Japanese in his life. 

He is also gay. Taking these things into account

For those of you who don't know mumsnet is a rather large UK website where middle class mummies go to talk about property prices and the latest organic food recipes. They also have a rather large feminist board with many a rad fem found therein. This means that regular middle class mums often come into contact with the Dworkin worshipers who think all sex is rape

They use lots of acronyms so here's a crash course.  
  
LTB = Leave The Bastard (quite concerning a relationships board would need an acronym for this)  
dh = dearest husband  
dp = dearest partner  
dd = dearest daughter  
ds = dearest son  
dc = dearest child  
  
  
This particular thread is in the relationships board. The [OP](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit) is upset that her husband is watching porn despite the fact that she has voiced displeasure with him watching porn before. Fair enough you might say
  
The whole thread is a great read I'm pretty sure OP is a troll. OP basically describes her husband as the perfect man, is great with the kids, loves her, they have a good sex life, he's very considerate in bed, the whole package. But he looks at porn!!!!!!! So obviously, according to Mumsnetters
  
Here are some more posts where OP describes her husband.
[He's kind and considerate](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205200)  
[I'm very lucky he works so hard so I can be a stay at home mum](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205374)  
  
My favorite bit. Op [describes that her husband handles the finances in the relationship](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205519) and several posters decide that she is being [financially abused](http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/a1760920-Oh-my-god-I-am-going-to-fucking-kill-dh-His-fucking-porn-habit#39205532)
  
Honestly the whole thread is pretty gold. There are a few people who turn up to say that porn is woman hating and that female porn stars are all trafficked rape victims. There are some posters who advise divorcing him
  
Anyway not the normal tumblrinaction stuff

You're not going to see this

You are an empty-headed

You cling to your ""victim"" status

If you've ever experienced legitimate oppression a day in your life, and not a dude, so I'm obviously not Bill Gates. 

You have no idea what actual oppression is. 

Actual oppression was my grandmother eating weeds to survive in the Soviet Union because of food shortages. 

Actual oppression is my neighbor fleeing Bosnia in the middle of the night

Actual oppression was segregation here in America. You know

Actual oppression was South African apartheid. 

Actual oppression is random Palestinian and Israeli kids getting blown up on their way to elementary school because of the conflicts between their two governments. 

Actual oppression was the comfort women

Actual oppression is the situation in Darfur. 

I could go on. 

You? You're a spoiled little brat mooching off your mommy and daddy

You're a pathetic spoiled child who won't last a day in the working world. In fact, people of all different races and nationalities can work together and get along just fine. But you'll never get a job unless you grow up. 

No love
