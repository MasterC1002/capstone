Under my covers is the warmest

My limbs can relax and all jokes are funnier when I’m wrapped up in them.

I think I might spend my whole life there if curiosity didn’t own me.

I get so proud of myself when I talk to people without trying.

Suddenly there’s a glimmer of hope that maybe I’m learning.

Maybe I’m learning so well that it will begin to come naturally to me.

But those moments are rare.

A green leaf on the sidewalk might call for my touch.

Even though it’s five feet and eight inches away from me

I know if I don’t I’ll feel myself come out of my skin

And get that neurological shake in my chest that I know so well.

I’m curious about every person I see.

The intense desire to get to know numerous persons never wavers.

But I know I can’t

Because people are not chess pawns and life is not a game of intelligence. 

I wish they were characters in a book though

Because then I could learn all about them without opening my mouth.

Avoid the cracks

Write perfectly rounded O’s

Dot the “i” elegantly,

Tap the light switch the same number of times with both hands

Don’t let your thumb touch the door handle

Create symmetry whenever possible

Or else they will die.

A lack of empathy?

No.

An inability to see myself.

Yes.

A face stares at me in the mirror every day

Yet I can’t really see her

And within hours I forget what she looks like completely

I was smothering, it was all very specific and very detailed. It was trying times, sometimes.

I started seeing a counselor who specializes in relationships with Aspergers and she gave me wonderful advice- keep a diary of all the little things you love about him or the sweet ways he tries to show you he cares...whenever you feel ""neglected"" because he doesn't lean in to kiss you first or doesn't want to cuddle all the time

You just lack the self awareness to percieve your surroundings and judge the appropriateness of your actions or words. A deadly silence falls upon the room and those eyes begin to bore into your soul

You dress odd. You either tend not to care how you look or look too good in the most innapropriate situations. You dress to impress because you feel you have something to prove. Something to make up for. “If I dress better maybe I can show them I’m a stand up guy?”

Your parents were always frustrated with you when you were younger. They wondered why you had all these problems. They constantly yelled at you, sometimes beat you because you didn’t give proper social responses. Didn’t respond well when they were mad at you, didn’t know why they were mad in the first place. Didn’t know whatever you did was wrong. So you assume innocense, and that made them more angry. It has made you hyper aware, and ultra critical of yourself.

As you grow up you realize there is help out there, but it makes other people notice more. It also balloons you up like a whale, which further hurts your allready negative self image.

All in all you find one thing you latch onto. One odd thing you obsess over and have intricate knowledge of. It makes you a good career. Your teachers, because you had no friends who could give you the answers.

So you live life behind a wall, and for those who branch out it’s even worse. If you stay inside your shell you live an empty life, but if you live with the rest of the world you are constantly reminded how you don’t truly belong in it, or move with it.

I have never hung out with girls ever and have filled that loneliness with weed for years. Just became sober two months ago
I felt too awkward to ever be around girls.


Anyways one girl who went to my elementary school started talking to me a while back.

We went out for coffee a few days ago and found out we have a lot in common

We can talk about anything. She understands im different and appreciates it.

Today we hung out at her house and cuddled (ive never fucking done this) watched some tv and then talked about life. 

She found out id never kissed a girl and said shed be honored to be my first kiss. I kissed her and i was immediately in shock? Not sure what word to describe it.

She didnt have any judgement of me. The whole night, to my fucking courtyard, against my garage, we 'practiced' making out for a very long time, in the cold rain. Ive never felt this feeling in my life. Its amazing and life is worth it.

We had some issues with pressure contact suction etc and what i was doing with my hands. I was pretty awkward and stopped to criticize myself but she just smiled and wanted me to kiss her more.

Cold rainy night.

The night ended with me walking her to her car with no awkwardness in our conversation at all

TlDr:
I have aspergers. I felt alone and rejected my whole life

I have met someone who knows i have AS and thinks it doesnt matter and makes me interesting. We love talking to eachother. We talk about anything

I'm not sure if this is a relationship or not. She'll sometimes, have a drink or snack, then go to bed with me.  She doesn't express any interest in shared activities other than cooking or watching TV, and never stays over.  She even sets an alarm on her phone to make sure she doesn't miss her train home.

The act itself is really

 But it wasn't like that from the beginning.

In fact, she let me get about an inch in, stopped me and had me hold it there, then said it hurt and we should stop.  And left.

For the next few days at work she said nothing and didn't even acknowledge me (as is often usual for her)

And this time it went further

I enjoy her company and conversation. It can be a little one-sided

Why am I saying this?

As a child, I listened to my parents, and wasn't a trainwreck, and I have friends and a social life

Today, but this large bucket does NOT describe me, and given the media's portray of Autistics (which is correct, for those who are not Aspies), it's guaranteed as so.  Am I the only one who feels this way?

My communication through writing is quite strong. I'm satisfied with this aspect of my communication.

Once it's verbal though - it's a lot worse. I cover it up better as an adult for the most part

I find it difficult to put my words in order when I want to speak. So I either have these weird pauses in the middle of sentences, it buys time to structure sentences and indicates to my audience that I'm not finished. So I guess that's why I ""stutter"", and it's also probably why the more relaxed and talkative I feel, the more prominent it becomes [less chance for scripted responses].

It's like there's a block between my mouth and my brain and it's really annoying. Then I still get things like you/me, up/down etc. mixed up, which never happens when I'm writing.

Very useless. This technology allows people to imagine how parents might feel when their autistic kids don’t make eye contact with them.

Yes. It’s a simulation exercise to make people aware of the utter heartbreak of having a child who struggles with eye contact. Except, the child isn’t struggling. The child simply does not make eye contact at all. Ever.

Her first word, the lid popped off and grape juice splattered all over the floor. As excited as I was to hear her correctly pronounce a complete word as well as use it in context, I was reticent to share the news with her grandparents, who were at the time very conservative christian leaders in their church. Fortunately, her vocabulary expanded quickly to include many far more generally acceptable words.

She spent most of her toddler-hood wandering naked in the back yard, covered from toes to waist with angry biting ants. Later, she would warn others about the fire ants, explaining in great detail how they worked in a group to defend their home.

She was a ""climber"", clawing and falling and still crying and screaming. Her interest in climbing didn't wane, but never again did she climb higher than she was able to get down. In a related story, at about age 12, she got angry and frustrated and marched off into the woods surrounding our house. An hour later one of my friends burst in the front door and said, ""you know where your kid is?"". I said, ""yeah, ""you'd better follow me"". Turns out my daughter was fast asleep

At age 6, ""have I ever told you about the Giant Pelagic Jellyfish?"" I replied, ""is Pelagic a word?"" She filled me in on everything from the creature's size, eating and mating habits, to the depth at which it lives in the ocean. Her thirst for knowledge about all living things never waned. Even now, if anyone in the family sees an unfamiliar insect, plant or animal, but then explain it in terms the rest of us understand.

She got involved in theater during high school, and ended up winning more than one ""High-School Idol"" contest. Halfway through her junior year, she lost interest in High School, so I shipped her off to my mother's house. She took her GED (scoring 100% on several sections) and enrolled in community college. Two years later, Associate's Degree in-hand, she was accepted by two well-known universities. After touring the campuses, she chose the one with more forest around it. No surprise.

She's tall, but team sports have never been her thing. I encouraged her to go have a chat with the Rowing coach at her university. Approximately 20 minutes after he first set eyes on her, she had a spot on the team and learned to love Crew. They ended up taking the DII championship. Around this time, she started getting bored of school again, and decided to take a break.

She hitch-hiked with a friend up and down the West Coast, the stories she has. Taught herself to play the Didgeridoo while there, and has become proficient enough that local farmer's markets ask her to perform. Within about a two-week period, she learned to play the guitar and can now quite comfortably accompany herself singing.

One more thing. Also while in High School

Yup. She's amazing. Hard to believe this is the same kid who wore bifocals, would not play with other kids and pulled out great chunks of hair in frustration. But it is. Awesome!

1351448904.0,128917,What kinds of patterns do you observe?,theresamcclain,38,5,44,"I had a discussion about patterns recently with a friend. I thought it would be interesting to see if others relate.

I observe 2 classes of patterns

The first class are patterns I find myself latching onto, when thinking about something I'll sometimes rub my fingers along the edge of a plastic zipper feeling the bumps as I move back and forth. I might find myself staring at a visual pattern in a carpet as I'm listening to somebody talk, tracing the pattern with my eyes. I think that because patterns, by their nature are predictable, focusing on them, even if unconsciously, reduces the amount of unanticipated input

The other class of patterns I notice are patterns I do not think others notice very often. These are sometimes patterns of behavior, I think I can tell how much stress a specific friend is under by what she eats (we eat out together frequently). When she is happy and relaxed, she almost usually orders a salad, or something healthy; however when she is stressed she will tend to order less healthy choices (e.g. hamburger and fries). I have not told her this, but it helps me to gauge her mood. I also have had bad experiences pointing things like this out to people.

Anyway, although also more difficult to find.

&gt; My husband and I have been together for close to a decade. In the beginning

&gt; Right now I'm laying in bed crying as I type this on my phone. He came to bed a few minutes ago and put his arm around me and fell asleep. No comforting

Comments were coming in

&gt; Thank you for your responses. I think I brought this to the wrong forum. It was late and I felt desperate. I'm feeling very overwhelmed by the responses that sound just like my husband

This really struck me. She was looking for a hug

The following day

&gt; As an NT wife of an aspie

That day she posted this to a different page:

&gt; For all the positives in our marriage

She loves him

I just checked her profile, and while there is consideration for spouse and kids, ""I think the world would be a much BETTER place if we all followed our dreams.""

It almost sounds like she wants out of the marriage.

But this isn't a new problem. It's a common theme

&gt; She knows some of the limitations (I hate the word ""challenges"" — say it like it is) of my thought processes and emotions, I won't show it in the same way, and it's going to be hard for both of us. And let's not get into the sex drive disparity (suffice it to say I've gone years without before with no ill effect).

Besides the emotional emptiness

&gt; Our sex life is abysmal. I've always thought he had a rather low sex drive

Then last week an article was posted

* Many describe living with an Aspie as ""water torture.""
* With limited empathy for others
* This mind blindness leaves the spouse wondering if she is understood or cared for or trusted by her Aspie partner.
* He will do what he thinks is best for the both of them but seldom talks to her about her feelings or opinions. And if she tries to share her love for him
* Often these relationships are without sexual intimacy.
* He has no need to understand her so her complaints are bothersome to him.
* An Aspie husband and Neuro-typical (NT) wife are often described as like two insulated wires wrapped around each other

She is part of a support group for other women in NT-AS relationships, and males are not allowed. It says it's for female spouses to connect with other women, who understand the realities of relationships with a partner on the spectrum, and that it's a safe place to talk, and receive empathy and support.

With all of this

But is that really what it means?

Kirsten is an AS young woman who publishes online

In one section it talks about her extroverted high school boyfriend trying to teach her to thrive socially:

&gt; Noting her tendency to speak in a monotone,” he told her flatly when she used her fingers to scoop up food she had dropped on a table at Taco Bell and ate it) and pointed out the unspoken social cues she often missed. He elbowed her as she spoke for long minutes to an acquaintance about her interest in animal physiology. “When people look away,” he explained, “it means they’re not interested.”

&gt; “You’re not a robot, she thought, the kind he wanted her to be.

That doesn't sound fun. That doesn't sound like he's connecting with her. It's always presented as a problem with the AS

The article goes on to paint Jack, because she could apparently feel more comfortable. It sounded like the extroverted guy who was training her was nowhere near satisfied with her, and it'd just be a matter of time before he grew frustrated and broke up with her.

But with the AS guy, that seemingly felt better. He was Aspie, she was Aspie, and they could find ways to bond over that, fitting with peculiarities.

For some, except that it's usually framed as the AS being defective.

Why do AS people want to attempt mating with the general population, and prove they can be just like everyone else.

But then look what happens. Even in the cases where an NT and AS incompatible in this way make it work, and isn't fully connecting how they could with someone who isn't needing the things they can't provide.

It goes beyond AS/NT too. If a non-AS is asexual, why do some people torture themselves, instead of just finding someone who fully appreciates them, and adores the AS stuff, not missing anything because they feel the same way?

I think besides just being undiagnosed, that a lot of it is that inferior mindset. But look at the concept illustrated with Kirsten's story. They might not be the poster for perfect AS-AS romance, but can't you just imagine that guy feeling better to be with her than some woman like that AS-basher with the support group? Why not find partners who adore the AS stuff like that?

Even if an incompatible NT is in love with AS, and that the AS-NT relationships that do work are somehow better or equal to AS-AS?

Then there's the question of children. There was a post from an NT wife seeing how the AS husband didn't connect with the children,,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,True

Now as an adult I am completely disconnected from people. I have one friend. I have my mother who is there for me

The hardest part of all is that I have no fucking clue what I am doing wrong. I feel very normal to me. I don’t feel like any of the things i say or do are super outside the norm--there is such a huge range of human activity

I get the impression that I am horrible to be around. I’m somehow weird or wrong. The “weirdness” seems to disgust people. They don’t want to hear me talk. They cut me off or just say something rude. Even with people who are nice and who I would consider good acquaintances if not friends I can tell what an effort it is for them to be patient with me. I don’t get invited places. If I do get invited once, the party never goes off and people leave early.

I try  so hard not to say anything bad or offensive. To wait for appropriate pauses in conversation. To not be too random. To not overshare. Not act too desperate or clingy or whatever.  I try not to be too loud and make sure not to be inappropriate/vulgar. But I also desperately want to be able to be myself and not just an actor playing the role of “normal.” If people like that actor, no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to totally pass for normal on a long term basis. I can fake short encounters and some things I’ve have learned to manage so that at least they aren’t traumatic. Having to put out that kind of energy and concentration just to make it though a few hours is exhausting. I cannot do this on a day to day basis. I feel like I’m going to have a nervous breakdown because I can’t keep track of all the millions of random things i’m supposed to do or not supposed to do at any given time. Oh yeah, and consciously monitoring the expression on my face, my mannerisms, random body language so that I can give off the “right” messages.

Sometimes I still try

But also

I don’t seem so unlikable to myself. I don’t do anything that I would think would be such a deal--I’m not lying and cheating people. I’m not being a douchbag. I understand what these things are and they disgust me. I’ve learned where most of the major social faux pas lie and avoid them. It’s much more subtle. It doesn’t seem to be something obvious. 

I’m so lonely--and I haven’t a fucking clue what I’m doing wrong that makes people find me so damn distasteful. It doesn’t seem to be any of the “normal” things that I can think of. And now I’m so anxious because I don’t know how to be that I’m turning into a total spaz.

Anyway

I guess I’m writing this because I’m just so frustrated and sad and it’s starting to make me depressed. Living this way for the next 50 or 60 years sounds like a nightmare (though I have no urge to kill myself or anything like that--I feel like that’s quitting and I don’t quit.)

Today I've been studying physics with a couple of people from my class. I think physics is rather difficult and I have a big exam on Monday so I'm a bit stressed out. Anyway

Another problem I have is that unless I don't fully understand something I can't really move on. I get stuck on something and unless someone explains it to me very specifically I'll eventually give up and instead of moving on to the next physics problem (for example) I get completely distracted and end up doing nothing. Because of this I ask a lot of questions and when studying today I think my two classmates got annoyed with me. At least that's what it seemed like at times. I also think at least one of them sometimes thinks I'm stupid because I don't process things the way she does and because I get distracted so easily (she said some things today which made it sound like she thought I was stupid). I'm not stupid. I think my brain gets overwhelmed or something.

When I notice strange looks for saying or doing something, I can simply shrug it off because I know that's just who I am and how I think.  I have aspergers and I'm not going to apologize for who I am.  I'll play the cards I was dealt and I'm going to perfect the things I do in life down to every small detail.  I'm immune to any manipulative social manuvers anyone trys to pull.  I don't give two shits about breaking social norms and exposing truth to a situation.  I will fine tune any activity I want to be good at and master it to a degree far beyond what most people are capable of doing.  Having aspergers is not a disability.

I went to a minor-league baseball game with my then-girlfriend (now wife), I looked off to my side and saw an empty can of Bud Light.

In my mind, I pictured myself grabbing the can, smashing it on my head, tossing it aside, ""Was that really necessary?"" and then it'd be done. 

So, took the can, tried to smash it on my head, and just knocked myself silly with the can. This, of course, was the moment that knocked me out of fixation mode and into reality. 

My S.O. and her sister, doubled-over. I understood, of course. It was a moment when an autistic fixation kind of caught up to me, and luckily it ended well (not only with one of my favorite stories, but three days later her dad, who witnessed this, gave me his permission to marry his daughter).

I was finally diagnosed with Asperger's in 2011. It was a two-year struggle to get the diagnosis. A clinical psychologist said yes, I went to get a formal assessment done and was told I was ""too complex"" for the assessor to give me an answer, due to my other mental health issues.

Then my psychiatrist suddenly backflipped and said

It's weird, which I guess is flattering? However, it also means people tend to assume that I'm not autistic even when I've told them, and then when I demonstrate autistic behaviours and reactions, I get blamed for being some sort of asshole. 

So I find it really frustrating. Yes, I study [currently studying a Master's degree]. I'm also a photographer and have exhibited my work around Australia, and I have a regularly gigging band. So okay, I can accept the ""high functioning"" label. Yet, I feel like I'm judged on those aspects alone, and my Asperger's gets shoved under the carpet. 

I don't even think my psychiatrist, and that completely baffled me. Or that he wishes I would be more ""emotionally intelligent"". Well, I would like to be more ""emotionally intelligent"" too but considering I was born with an alternative wiring in my brain which impairs that ability, there's a limited amount I can do about it.

I've told various friends and family about my Asperger's diagnosis

+ ""No you're not"" / ""No way!"" / ""You don't seem autistic."" &lt;&lt; I wish I could get paid $1 for every time someone's said that to me because that would pay for a holiday to Hawaii or Polynesia.

I'm an Aspie. Surprise
I've a story to tell

Story on recognizing emotions: 
It's downright difficult to communicate with others for me, I have had great difficulty with recognizing my own emotions. I would experience an emotion, but I could not recognize which emotion it was. Is this anger? Is this sadness? Is this betrayal? Is this jealousy? The only way I knew how to label an emotion I was feeling was to describe to myself my thought process during the time. From there, I would sort of reverse engineer my thoughts to their emotional foundations. It's a pain in the butt, yet I've learned to endure it quite handily. I am now 22 years old and I still find myself having trouble with recognizing which emotions I experience. I often end up asking my girlfriend to give me a few minutes to determine what emotion I am feeling to continue a conversation or discussion with her. She gladly obliges my request. Bless her for being so patient and understanding with me. I really need to know if there are any others that have this hindrance as well. 

TL;DR I often have trouble recognizing not only other's emotions

Question for everyone:
Have/do you ever experience a similar difficulty in recognizing your own emotions? If so

Feel free to share any experiences you or someone you know have had in as much detail as you want. I find it supremely helpful to be able to relate to others like me.

Quick back-story on me for perspective. I was officially diagnosed a few months ago with Aspergers/High-Functioning Autism after a couple years of self-diagnosing. I struggle with anxiety in so many flavors with the most prominent being social and organizational/executive functioning.  My anxieties became pronounced after getting married and have increased with addition of each of our two kids. 

I started running a little over a year ago because I wasn't happy with my body image and knew that exercise needed to be a part of it. I'd never enjoyed running before

I'd never taken an extended break in my running schedule that whole time until a few weeks ago when I slightly injured my left knee. Over those next three weeks, depressed, etc. It was incredibly overwhelming, and it wasn't until the end of my break that I realized that I had felt like this before, all the time. Before I started running.

Immediately after I resumed my running schedule, I was having fun with my wife. I am still anxious in all the predictable spots, but they require a much more intense trigger to activate them. I'm just happy I have the motivation to play with my sons again. I'm just happy that I don't feel like I am constantly on the verge of meltdown when I am at home.

* Urge to hide under the desk.  I'm 33 years old, not to indulge it with the office door open.  
* Songs stick in my head a lot longer than most people.  
* Twirling leg hair into spikes. 
* Operating on autopilot for navigation. (My company moved offices.  I once ended up driving to my old office building, and heading to my old office.

A couple thoughts were running through my head today. About Aspergers and sexuality. I'm not technically asexual

I've loved someone. A girl, this guy is amazing in every way"". I literally could not stop thinking about this friend. I desired to be with him, to enjoy my moments laughing and goofing around like the best of friends.

Now, I don't think it's a ""love"" thing. It is purely a ""friend"" thing.  

But the feelings. They're the same feelings I get when thinking of my obsessions. You know what I mean. The one that fills you with excitement and happiness when you think about that certain obsession (mine being computers). Truly beautiful.

I don't know about you

I'm starting to rant, female, inanimate object, none of that matters when I am so attached to it. 

I guess another (less creepy) way to put it is, but my obsessions get the better of me and I start to like this person to the point where most NT's would be creeped out. 

Can anyone relate?

1372262901.0,1h45ll,Aspergers and pets - I don't want my dogs,petguilt,35,13,37,"How do you feel about pets?
 
I’ve only realized recently that I have Aspergers.  I am trying to find a therapist to start dealing with it but in the meantime
 
And I think one of my weaknesses is dealing with animals. My siblings had allergies growing up so I didn’t have furry pets growing up. I had brief experiences after that and as an adult I’ve had fish, right?) We now have two. One we adopted from a shelter a year ago and another my partner brought home a few months ago. They’re both mixed breeds, one is lab size and the other one will be. I wanted a small dog like a dachshund, but my partner had large dogs growing up. I’m regretting not standing my ground. 

My sensory issues and OCD is mostly at fault. The worst issue is that I can’t stand the way they smell. I would have to bathe them twice a week and I still don’t like how they smell after a bath. I feel like they’re always dirty. I don’t like being licked or being jumped on. I don’t like hair and mud all over my house and I’m paranoid letting them run free in the house because they have chewed things up. I would have to be paranoid about constantly picking up because everyone leaves toys and stuff out. I don’t like that they bark all the time (because they’re probably bored) and worry the neighbors disapprove about the noise. I don’t like dealing with poop and am tired of constantly fixing things they chew on or break.

The dogs mostly live outside in the back yard in a fenced-off area of the yard and come in to an indoor kennel at night or during rain storms. That’s it. My only interaction with them is taking them out in the mornings or bringing them in the evenings
 
My kids don’t even play with them as much as I envisioned. The 4 year old likes them but they’re always jumping on him and knocking him over so I’m worried leaving them out when he’s around. My 10 year old will play tug-of-war with them once in a while but isn’t strong enough to walk them. And he shows no interest in helping take care of them. Guinea pigs are about the limit of his willingness and that’s only because they’ll squeak when they need something.
  
I can’t talk to my friends about it because I’ve also realized that I think of animals…as animals. I enjoy the AWW subreddit as much as anyone else but at the end of the day, but they're an animal, not a human. And all my friends are die-hard dog lovers who agonize over what food to feed them and sleep with them at night. 
 
So I’m at a crossroads. My true gut feeling is I don’t want the dogs. They were a mistake. I’m not attached to them at all. They’re more of a burden than a companion. But I feel like such a horrible person for not wanting them after adopting them. I even did a Google search to see if anyone else felt the way I did and got nothing but people ranting about anyone who gives up animals. I can’t talk to my closest friends about it and I’m afraid that I’m going to lose them over this because I doubt they'll understand.

I’m not looking to give the dogs up to a shelter. I will advertise and find them a home. I love them enough to want them to have a better life
 
And I vow to never adopt an animal larger than a cat and not for a very long time. I know my limits now and I'm understanding myself better every day. I can deal with the guinea pigs. I am open to fish or parakeets again. But I won’t adopt something that I've never had before and not unless one of the kids is taking care of it. They can play with dogs at other people’s houses.
 
But I still feel like a horrid horrid person.
 
My partner is away on business until next week so I’m trying to figure out how to broach the subject. If he’s willing to step up and walk them, not children.
 
This will probably be downvoted to oblivion, as long as they're respectful.
 
tldr; I recently found I have Aspergers. Due to sensory issues I have realized I don't want my large dogs any more because of sensory issues. I'm feeling horrible guilt as a result.
 
EDIT - Thank you for all of the responses. I think what it comes down to is that I see owning pets/dogs as normal and something that I should be able to handle. I wanted my children to have the whole Lassie/Benji experience and it has fallen flat. I need to stop trying being somebody that I'm not.

I can't remember ever feeling like I was happy, but I don't feel like I've ever been very unhappy either. I just remain, neutral and impassive.

So in my quest to understand Aspergers, of course, behavior. 

So I started asking some questions I would ask about different cultures and then I came upon the subject/concept of Ownership. 

Now, it didn't stop me from thinking about a particular habit of mine that I just can't quit. 

When it comes to ownership, my best friend's mom would tell me every day that if I wanted food, I could just go into the pantry and get it myself. For seven years, I never once did that. I tried to, once, but had to reassure myself that it was ok to take that particular food item by asking my friend multiple times if she wasn't going to eat it. ever. 

It goes further. I can't even grab things out of my own mother's pantry. It was one of the things that kept me from baking and cooking for so long. What if she needed the sugar for something she was planning to bake? What if I used too much flour? So I didn't. I made distinct decisions about which foods belonged to everyone else and which ones belonged to me. Like popcorn. I got very possessive about popcorn. lol. 

And it isn't just a food thing. I have a very hard time accepting gifts. I have a very hard time borrowing things from anyone. As a woman

Here is how I figure out someone:

NT's have this *intuition* about other NT's.  They know fairly quickly whether a person is someone they want to be around or befriend.  I do NOT possess that ability no matter how hard I tried and no matter how often I tried to convince myself that I did (many failed interactions proved this).

I have to find a person's *pattern* before I can determine if that person is suitable to have any sort of relationship with (friendship

This takes time and a lot of observation on my part. It can take months, and people's patience runs out long before they get through it.

However

After years of failed friendships and many many times of being taken advantage of (even raped once) because I didn't understand that I needed to find there pattern FIRST...I've finally settled on this is how my friend making process has to work.  

For example, ""You couldn't tell that he was only after you sexually?"" I was like, ""WHAT?! NO!  I'm gay and he KNOWS I'm gay...why would he think he had a chance with me that way???""  She said (she's NT), ""I could see it in his eyes!"".  I was like HUH!? I had absolutely NO IDEA. This blindsided me, and was the final situation to make me FINALLY understand that I had to complete this process with people of there pattern so that hopefully I'm never hurt again.  :/

Another example: I used to either open up to someone entirely too soon in a friendship and they think I'm weird for sharing personal or TMI type of stuff too soon

As her father, she's relatively social with people she knows, she doesn't appear to have any overwhelming interests in particular subjects.

She does have social challanges, and has always had a great vocabulary.  She can't hold a tune or  beat, and prefers the company of adults, but has been getting much better lately with kids her own age.

Yet, etc.   I feel the report makes her appear to be quite a ways down the spectrum, and not the ""mild"" level that my wife and I have always assumed.

When I was 18, I often hurt myself by either punching a wall as hard as I can, or bashing my head on something hard (wall/desk/book/fist etc.). Often this calms me down, but I have hurt myself quite badly in the process a few times.

Most people don't know about this as I usually only do it when I'm alone, so I make sure not to do it in front of her).

Some less dangerous alternatives have helped

* Sometimes listening to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvCbzfieLLA) over and over again has calmed me down

* Sometimes I scream/roar and it helps (but I try not to do this as people find it strange)

* If I get upset whilst walking somewhere

* I have been a bit obsessed with numbers and counting my whole life

The problem is that I am often not in a position to do these things. I am not usually in a position to hide away listening to angry songs for half an hour, but is the least effective option in the list. However, I can usually find a wall to punch or a desk to bash my head on discreetly.

Examples:

1. I was at the grocery store and the cashier decided to bag all of my groceries in one comically large bag. I politely informed her I was walking

2. My mom only talks to me when she wants money from me. I always tell her in detail my exact financial situation, she wins. She gets me to agree to lending her money that I know I'll never get back, and I do it all while being polite because that's really all I know. 

I talked to the leader of the social skills group at the MIND institute

How do you handled preparing for an interaction where you know you have to be mean? How do people normally react? What tricks do you use to display meaness to the other person? Any other helpful advice or tips? 


EDIT: Note that being assertive take a bit of ""meaness"" to do it right. If you're going to tell me to be assertive keep in mind that I still don't know how to do that.

I deleted my entire library, I was looking at things differently. No longer seeing things in rose-colored glasses. Without the beautiful sensation of song, my world became dull. Blank. Grey. Boring.

I was really bitter. I noticed it

The song was by C418, better music. I discovered new artists, and new albums.

Oxytocin can certainly help with perceiving social cues. You start to pay more attention to the eye region

However
1) Side effects like headaches
2) Long-term effects have yet to be studied
3) You have to increase your dose every time because you develop a tolerance (this has something to do with the double function of oxytocin as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter)

1374331530.0,1ip2kb,My Social Boyfriend and Dealing with Aspergers,sacaroni,25,4,14,"This is a bit of a detailed rant

So, really great and even though it’s really early on in our relationship, I feel lucky to have someone who will sit and listen to what I say without judgment, even when it doesn’t make sense most of the time (I can never find the words to describe what I’m thinking, so my thoughts sometimes come out all jumbled). 

Here’s the issue: he’s a really social guy. He has a lot of friends and very personable even with strangers. It’s like he can make friends anywhere. I, but none of them are really in the area, so I don’t have to many friends where I live. I can never really make that sort of connection with anyone else, and it’s frustrating because I feel like I’m generally a nice, laid back person.

So, but it can also be exhausting. I am literally thinking about every social thing there is to think about, like, what should I be saying to this person, how do i enter this conversation like a “normal person”; and then since I’m thinking so much it becomes, “oh god you’ve been silent for too long, say something” and then the pressure’s on. ugh. I’m usually okay when there’s just a few people and we’re in a familiar place like his apartment. I might sit in his room for a couple seconds every now and then to chill out. 

Last night was different, only one of whom I had met before, and they were all really nice and cool. During the movie, the power went out so, we left the theater early. I started to get that uneasy feeling when we were going to his friend’s house. I’m always a tad uncomfortable when I’m in an area that I’m not completely familiar with (and it was nighttime), but usually I can get over it (google maps). It was like, so many plans were changing and I had to re-adjust my mind for all of the unexpected,and I was done at that point (mentally tired, as we start to make our way to the bowling alley, I’m feel physically uncomfortable too

 Then (even after I told everyone I wasn’t 21 yet), specifically the interaction that would have to take place between me and the bartender about sitting at the bar. So, of course, asked for an ID, and I lied and said I didn’t have one on me, so I just left really feeling kinda shitty at this point. I guess crying is like my meltdown, but it always looks like I’m just weird and over-emotional. It really is just me letting all the frustration out. I don’t cry because I’m sad, who was doing the best he could with what I was giving him. My bf was really trying to comfort me and was out in the pouring rain trying to hail a cab for me.  If i remember correctly, I most of the time can never exactly pinpoint what emotion I’m feeling (I’ve heard of this being called alexithymia) 

I just wish I could explain it to him or have him read this without thinking I have a serious problem. Sometimes I think, and he thinks I’m crazy.” It’s not a serious problem for me, it’s just that sometimes, in the wrong situations, I can get really overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Not all the time, just sometimes when things get really unfamiliar. But I also don’t want him to feel like this is a problem that he has to take on as his own. It’s not his burden and I don’t want it to be. It’s just that,sometimes, I don’t feel like myself, I’m gonna be thrown in a lot of his social activities. 

Overall, so is it better to write something for him to read? Should I show him this, or would it be weird considering we've only know each other a couple months? Not sure how to proceed.

So, so I did some research to see what we were missing.  One suggestion that pops up everywhere is cyber sex... which I'm not against (I made the suggestion), I just don't get it.  We've had awkward moments where he's trying to be ""sexy"" and I don't get it, or I'm trying to be ""sexy"" and he doesn't get it.  We end up laughing at each other, which I think is great that we can laugh at each other and be okay about it, but it kills the mood.

So, so I was hoping to get some insight from people who maybe have a similar thought process?

So I guess I have two questions.  One is seeking for reassurance.  I know to my boyfriend, but on my insecure days it makes me sad that I'm still ""weird"" to someone I really love and I know loves me.  So I'm wondering if any of you (guys or gals) feel the same about sexual images as I do.  (For me, finding any pleasure in porn is a real effort, and I still don't really get it...)  Also, if you have any suggestions on how to approach cybersex or even just ""sexy"" pictures without feeling completely ridiculous, or feeling ridiculous and just knowing that the other person thinks its something other than ridiculous, that would be really helpful too.  I'm not at all against this - I'm the one who suggested it

Even not talking long distance,"" but there are very few things I find ""sexy"" and I feel like a complete fool doing all but a very few forms of foreplay (that I've gotten used to since we started).  So even if you have this experience not in terms of long distance cyber sex but know what I'm talking about in a physical sense, I would like to hear your experiences/thoughts/ideas.

It's not really annoying, and feeling like the world is judging me.

I find that I can understand everything, as you may have guessed, is that I can't handle too much of it. One on one with someone I know I'm fine and never have issues; in a crowd or with a stranger I almost always do. 

Of course, meet someone or interact with something, they are forming an understanding of the causative effects between themselves and the person/object. That's obvious. What isn't is how quickly I can personally do it, and the mass confusion I feel when I make a bad calculation. I can't interact ""naturally"" with people, I have to have at least an idea of how to simulate them in my head to even be slightly functional socially. 

As a result I'm put in about the same position as the majority of those in this community; I have a tendency to be awkward, have general alexithymia, etc.. The part I'm not really understanding is if this really has anything to do with Aspergers at all, disregarding if the effects are the same, and as a wider question, how on earth is Aspergers even defined? How can it possibly have a real, scientific definition if the ""appraisal"" of one's condition is determined by a clinical diagnosis

The ""definition"" given on the wiki page is amorphous at best, and I don't mean in any way that I doubt the significance of psychological testing, but to be honest I'm a bit shocked by the way the process has been handled. I should be clear- my psychologist has been a paragon of professionalism, I'm just surprised there isn't a more concrete way to determine the position of an individual on the spectrum than to have a trained professional sit down and talk with you. Trained or no, I would never trust a subjective human being's perspective over scientific rigor and associated, peer reviewed literature. (And to further clarify, I'm quite well aware that each diagnosis is based upon peer reviewed literature, not psychologists.)

I do apologize for the long read as well, I am really interested to hear what the rest of you have to say since I don't really know anyone with an ASD in real life. Thanks for your time :)

The biggest reason is that my husband has anger issues. He gets annoyed about small things -- like being in a crowded store

I'm pretty certain his mother has Asperger's too, they just leave him be. I've seen several people on this forum talk about the importance of parenting a child with Asperger's and in my husband's case, I don't think this was done. 

My husband thinks I should ignore his outbursts but, it ends up isolating me and makes me increasingly want to get out of the relationship. Because his parents have never told him that his behavior is unacceptable, he doesn't realize the full extent of how his anger affects me. A few hours later, he'll have forgotten that he had a meltdown at all, while I'll still be hurt and upset. He's told me several times that he'll work on it, but because he hasn't internalized the extent of the problem, I haven't really seen any results. 

He's also very very moody and sometimes ""just wakes up on the wrong side of the bed

Edited to add: My husband accepts his Asperger's diagnosis and sees it as a largely positive thing. While I'm glad that he finally has something that helps explains why he's different

Edited to add 2: Thank you for all your great responses. I guess the main point of posting this was to help me figure out how much I'm willing to put into the marriage to make it work. I know I have to be patient and work at it,  and I really want to know how to communicate this to him.

I've generally been a commenter on this subreddit, and I just hope at least one of you is willing to talk to me. Out of all the subreddits, this place seems to be where I'm understood best. I do have Aspergers. I'm 18 years old, female, and have a part-time job.

Recently, she's an unfit parent and is no longer in contact with me because when I try to call her, she just never answers and never calls back. No, I have no idea where she is. And no, I don't know my father. 

So this lead to me being homeless for a while until I could move in with my aunt, and more are moving in. So I've been doing okay here, but I've been spending all my money on food that they all eat, and I've barely gotten to eat at all lately. I haven't been able to sign up for foodstamps yet because my mom signed up already and took them. I haven't had the chance to spend a day in the welfare office. I have bagels and nuts stashed in my room to feed me until Saturday I believe. I have to ask for rides to go anywhere (and pay for all of their gas, even if I'm not in the car), so you can imagine how frustrating that is when I don't have nearly enough for my own vehicle. I work most of the week, so on breaks I try to walk places and gather/buy food and essentials when I can. My boyfriend helps me out as well. 

I don't think anyone understands how difficult this is on me. My own flesh and blood mother wants nothing to do with me

I have the option of moving 400 miles away to stay with my sister. She has a very nice place, I'd actually get to save money and keep my sanity.

Literally the only reason I am here is because of my boyfriend. I love him dearly and I can't bear the thought of leaving, but I really don't have many beneficial options right now.

So, at least in part, dictated by a disorder--the good and the bad. But I have not revealed this to my parents in fear that they'll tell me I'm silly and just claim that I'm ""doing it"" because my boyfriend ""has"" Aspergers. 

This secret has been plaguing me for a long, since he knows all about them. 

Immediately, and that they simply would not pass. I told them they were wrong, to which my mother replied ""no, trust me on this. They wouldn't pass the test"".

I was a virgin when I got married. I was a very late bloomer sexually and had moral/religious convictions about remaining a virgin till marriage. But I /did/ have a sex drive and get turned on and wanted my fiancé... But when we got married it was hard because of the vaginismus

I don't like the feel of skin on skin. I can't stand the feel of it if there's sweat involved--which is obviously common.

On the other hand, but it never seems to be enough. And even though he tries not to pressure me, I sense his discomfort and pressure myself, which turns me off more.

It's just these little things that made notice it and got me a little worried. For instance: when I ask it to do a lot of things at once by incoherent commands, but it takes a while when I'm asking a lot at once. I'm so annoyed by this, why can't it just execute my incoherent and plural commands at once without freaking out for a bit?

Sometimes I try to communicate with it and have it tell me what he knows; he likes doing that. He loves doing math and knows lots of historic and scientific facts, he gives me a list of possible explanations that often conflict with one another and I'm afraid it's not very good at filtering the correct information from all the signals that's entering it.

That last bit really happens a lot though. Usually it's very friendly and one of the best co-workers I have, be more noisy, unresponsive or just give me pages and pages and hours upon hours of data on the same subject. It sometimes even shuts down completely :o Especially when I keep changing the subject. It always replies about the same subject and it can change topics to a related subject, it usually links to them itself, but just a random fluid conversation seems impossible.

I'm really fed up with him for not being able to guess what I want without me expressively telling him. Why can't it just see what I need or want from him?

ps: He's a good guy though! If you give him very specific orders or questions and a good structured environment, it's non judgmental and despite what he perceives as my erratic behavior, it will not turn its back to me... it takes time, but once you get to know him, he's easy to be a good and appreciated friend. It might not react to me in ways I'm used to, but it seems happy when I'm back. I think so at least, always hard to tell though.

I am interested to see if some of the things that bother me are shared by others. 

Here are a few things that bother me.

1. I seem to see the world in a very black and white way so things like double standards really bother me. 

2. My time going to college was very difficult because I was studying psychology and the social sciences. I now understand why people say the soft sciences are a joke because they are. Most research always starts off with a desired outcome in mind then people just work backwards to find evidence to support it. 

3. Athiests that deny science and historical evidence to bash religion. I don't really think a person needs to look that hard to find an issue with religion so it irks me when people are lazy and make up things. Violence, fighting over land, etc all existed before organized religion and can be seen in nature so I hate when people try to blame all the bad things in the world on Religion or a certain religion. 

4. I hate bicyclists and motorcyclists because these people never follow laws and seem to stress me out while driving. Just yesterday we almost hit a motorcyclist who didn't signal or look before changing lanes.

My cousin Jade was born to my mothers sister (whom I will refer to as monicrack) when she was 35 years old

Jade was being raised mostly by the rest of the family

Jade was passed from house to house, vans and only ""god"" knows where else. At one point, when Jade was a mire 3/4 years old, they lived in a shack in someones backyard, using a bucket as a toilet. 

Well, decided enough was enough and she was going to get custody of Jade. Which sounds like an awesome thing right? No. My mom was is a unmedicated, bipolar, and very very very abusive, mentally and physically, person. 

The way my mom went about it was she asked Monicrack to have Jade for Thanksgiving. Monicrack complied and Susan just never gave her back. As soon as she got her

Within the amount of time Jade was with my mother, was 18 living on my own, with my new daughter and fiance. I tried calling CPS several times on her, and tried my hardest to fight for Jade as much as I could... but I failed. All CPS did was go to her house, tell her to clean it up (Susan is also a hoarder) and that was that. 

The rest of the family was banned from visiting or keeping in contact with Jade

 Well, my husband had just left me and my two children for another woman, and I had no job at that point, but I was willing to help raise Jade with Ricque (Now 23 with her own two kids and husband). 

Ricque took her to a therapist right away and found out Jade has aspergers....

2) what things help you identify that it has reached meltdown stage? I cry a lot, feeling like I can't breathe or calm down, also feeling extremely violent toward myself and others - including inanimate objects. Also screaming happens. Shaking.  Tense all over. Racing but repetitious thoughts. 

3) are your meltdowns often caused either directly or indirectly by one or more other people? Once you his meltdown stage, but am I the only one who just starts despising people in the middle of meltdowns?

4) doesn't it just ruin your whole day after you have a meltdown? I feel like crap about myself and angry at people who might have been involved, plus I feel exhausted - like totally drained afterward. And it seems to give me the opposite effect of ""rose-colored glasses"" where everything looks bleak and gray. 

5) how do you prevent or stop or recover from meltdowns? I don't have a set way that works for me. Sometimes my husband can hold me to calm me down if he wasn't part of the original cause

6) I don't know about you all, I feel more convinced than at any other time that absolutely no one in my life understands me the least little bit. And I can't tell if that thought/feeling is true or just an emotion. I feel crappy because no one understands what happened or why it even bothered me - and especially not why it bothered me to such an extreme degree - and they get freaked out and bothered and/or feel guilty because of my outward manifestations of the meltdown, so I feel crappy for that, too, and then they seem to feel that once I do calm down, everything is okay because the crazy out-of-proportion outburst is over, and they completely fail to understand that for me and how my brain and emotions work, and even if I calm down its still not all better!! And to top it all off

7) I don't know what to say. I don't hate my AS. I don't even hate meltdowns. I hate the complete lack of understanding I get from anyone in my life. I hate the way I end up feeling completely isolated. I hate how miserable I feel

As a person with Asperger's Syndrome

It doesn't mean we lack empathy. We have it. We just can't express it as well. We struggle when it comes to expressing all kinds of emotion. We have these emotions but we don't necessarily understand them or know how to express them as well as other folk. That is all.

I've always related well to animals. Maybe I understand animals better than the average person, uncertainty and anxiousness more than anything else. That's why many people on the spectrum get diagnosed with depression and other mental illnesses.

We're not mentally ill by default. We may BECOME mentally ill due to the environments we're forced to live in. 

Temple understood that cattle sought out an unusual or interesting object and thus, even though she wasn't against their eventual slaughter. In her field, she is a genius... all because she was born with autism.

I myself have always felt a strong connection with animals. I understood them. I knew when they might be scared. I didn't want to frighten an animal. I didn't want to corner them. Whenever I've encountered an animal the first and foremost thing on my mind would be how that animal FELT around me. Would they be afraid? Would this environment be good for them? Would they feel content here? I have always connected with animals on a way I don't think most neurotypicals do. 

When I see a muzzled dog or a cat that's uncomfortable in its environment, just like my needs are simple. I feel like most humans don't understand what animals want at all and it terrifies me.

My brother has many of the typical symptoms of Aspergers - he finds social situations stressful, freezes up on physical contact, clumsy, dyslexic, obsessive routines etc - and was diagnosed early on at school. He hated school all the way through, but received a lot of help and assistance to get him through and help him understand why he was struggling without feeling alienated or strange. 

However, he has gotten so stressed that he has made himself ill. When I found him the other day, he was crying and shaking very violently - it was incredibly distressing to see, especially seen as he is such a gentle, sweet and peaceable person and I have always felt very protective of him. He told me that he is tired of having to force himself to engage in social situations, reading things he doesn't understand and feels like he just makes mistakes all the time. 

So

I want to ask if anyone with Aspergers can give me some insight into how they personally feel about working

I know everyone is, but I felt this might be able to help me in helping my brother deal with his anxieties.

He then goes on to talk about how horrible it is that kids would rather be inside playing online games than outside playing sports.

From my point of view, I can say things I wouldn't normally say with the social awkwardness I usually have when out in public. Also, when did liking the internet become an addiction? If I see something funny on youtube or reddit, I'm going to think back to it and maybe tell friends about it. Big whoop. Also, I always hated sports and never enjoyed playing them one bit.

But I'm not posting necessarily to ask you all if I'm AS. That would be a whole other long-winded post. I'm posting because I can't deal

My husband had to go to the ER Mon night. I was rather calm and focused, everything has been crap. I meltdown almost every time I have to talk to someone in the Army (my husband is a soldier, so all his care is Army-provided). The day after he was admitted to the hospital I had to literally chant ""everything is going to be ok everything is going to be ok"" nonstop for 2-3 hrs just to function enough to gather my husband's supplies the hospital wanted and make the drive there. If I stopped, I melted down. The following day I called the doc but they couldn't see me, so I sat outside the ER for a half hr crying and stimming and trying to talk myself into doing it... I finally went in, and they did give me some more of my extremely low dose anxiety med that I had run out of (with no refills). 

One night I had to go thru a tornado warning on my own and sleep in the closet

Friday I almost melted down at the doc office when she challenged some of my opinions about how things were going

Saturday was the worst of all, and then had another meltdown when I got home to try and talk to my husband on the phone... Sunday, more meltdowns. 

Yesterday I tried to drive my car to the shop to get it fixed up and I got pulled over because my tire was going flat. I melted down right away and I'm sure the cops thought I was nuts. I was going slow with my hazards on and was like 3 mins from the shop

Strangely
Saturday... I got in his truck and felt calm because it was familiar... 

But melted down again when I went to the hospital later to visit my husband. 

Thank God my mom realized I'm absolutely unable to deal with any more and she booked a flight last night

In the meantime... It's about all I can do to feed the animals and myself and keep driving to the hospital to visit my husband. :(

I don't know what I'm looking for here. But there you have it. I needed to say it to y'all because... No one seems to understand when I say I just CAN'T handle this. Can't function. Can't do it.

I'm writing this to get this all out there. I am really tired and stressed out and I think this will help. I just want other people out there to know what I've been through. What happened to me is pretty much unforgivable

I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was prescribed too much medication by a pill pushing doctor afterwards. I was sent to a psych ward when I was 15 because I had a huge mental breakdown. I thought that I would go crazy due to medication. The Doctors wouldn't tell me any information about it and I was experiencing side effects I knew nothing about. I was discharged after a long period of time. I tried a few other options for finishing highschool. I was met with more trauma. I was diagnosed with Asperger's at 17. I went through some therapy with a behavioral management specialist

The last thing I was working on with my therapists was an attempt at getting my own apartment

When I was 18 an ambulance came to my house and took me away to the hospital for a second time. It was pretty much my biggest fear, or 'theraputic' group home I would have to have medical tests done. Due to my previous experiences with Doctor's, and traumatic psych ward experiences I was *afraid of hospitals.* However, I was an agoraphobic shut in at the time. My BMS, OT and the people in charged convinced my parents to call the ambulance without my knowledge. It was their flawed logic that sending me to the hospital to get medical tests done would help me. **None of this was done with my knowledge. No one actually explained what was going on. I was 18 and they were treating me like a child. No one told me, for 6 months, they were planning to send me to the hospital again.**

However

The first night in the hospital was very traumatic and I went into shock. I don't remember much. I woke up and everything got worse. The pill pushing Dr. visited me with the biggest, intimidate me. I wasn't given a choice. He then proceeded to explain to me that I was to stay in the psychiatric ward. The same one as 3 years ago. I had a nervous breakdown, and was forced to take seroquel and bigger doses of my other medications. Seroquel is a dissolving pill. I couldn't fake swallowing it. 

The psychiatric ward was horrible. I live in a small town. The psych ward is cramped. If something happens in your brain, schizophrenic 20 something year olds, dementia patients, drug addicts, etc. The people that stand out in my mind, are well, the examples I just listed. They are real examples. I wasn't exaggerating. Also, a worker there is allegedly a pedophile. Things that stand out in my mind is a dementia patient who would constantly cry. Constantly. 24/7. I'm sensitive to noise because of my Aspergers. This was not a good combination. There was a 60 year old recovering alcohol whose wife divorced him through the telephone. He ended up in a locked room banging on the doors while we were in lockdown.

Keep in mind

I managed to get outings with my parents. I went out as much as I could as long as I could.

Then, there was a room with nothing in it, with a live video feed. This was used for when someone became violent. It wasn't soundproof, unfortunately. There were at least two workers 24/7. There was supposed to be one male, and one female. One person for cooking and another person for safety. (If someone became violent.) It was hard to believe than an obese 300+ female and 60 year old man with bad knees who survived 3 heart attacks was supposed to protect us when someone became violent though. There were two other patients there, besides myself.

One person was about 30 years old. He was adopted by his parents. They weren't even his biological parents, or really speak properly. He could memorize every date in every calendar from 1775 to 2025. However, he has regressive autism. His brain couldn't organize his memories properly, hence the low functioning part of his autism...  This Autistic person was only about 30. He was also very troubled. When I arrived in the group home the walls were literally peppered with holes, which were plastered over. I didn't realize it was by his doing until he started putting a hole in the wall literally every day. He would also scream every day, and tell everyone to fuck off every day in a strange idiosyncratic voice. (It sounded oddly like Terrence McKenna's voice.) He would also bang the dinner table. (The only way we were allowed to eat food, was if we ate with everyone at the dinner table. It was either food + noise, and press hard on things and rock back and fourth. I feel really guilty I couldn't help

On a side note

It was especially heartbreaking to see someone forget everything because my Grandfather suffered Alzheimer's before he died. But, and dropped out. I didn't see my Grandfather at the hospital, and it killed me when I was 15. He forgot how to eat too.

I've noticed similarities with myself and him and the same age. (My mother also says we're exactly alike)

Things that stick out in my childhood memories are, terrified of authority and walking around on tiptoes.

Nowadays

I feel as I'm getting older its getting harder to not alienate everyone. 
It feels like everything outside of home life is .. fake? for lack of a better word.  Going through the motions

I also feel like I need a task or I'll drive myself crazy.

Because of the revelation that I arrived at, many people I meet, if the subject of my Asperger's somehow comes up or if I choose to trust them with the information, are skeptical, and seem not to believe me, presumably because I have improved my social skills and lessened the intensity of my tics, etc. to the point where I seem mostly ""normal"" to people.

I am not ashamed of how I am. I was born this way, in most cases had never met a person with Asperger's before, and seemed to believe that because I don't act like Rain Man or Sheldon Cooper, I must not ""really"" have autism or Asperger's. These people cannot see into my brain and have no idea what it is like to be me. In most cases these have been friends who have only seen me interact with people in situations where I feel comfortable, and have never seen how I react to social anxiety or pressure. They did not know me as a child, when my symptoms were more pronounced. Even if this is explained to them, they seem to think writing me off as ""just a little strange"" is the proper diagnosis.

1371091059.0,1g8q6x,I wrote this short essay describing how I felt after discovering I have Asperger's Syndrome,nefnaf,21,5,9,"(FWIW - I made this discovery last week)  

Almost in an instant

“I have Asperger’s.”  

With those three simple words

Relief that so many mysteries are no longer mysterious. There were questions that I had carried with me all my life, I can’t relate. When other people talk about their identity, whether it’s their country, hometown, ethnicity, religion or whatever it is, I can’t relate. Why the **fuck** am I so different from everyone else? Is it because I’m smart? Is it because of my parents / upbringing? Is it just because I’m an asshole?” *No. In fact, awkwardly

Before I thought I might have ADHD

Next comes regret. Regret that I didn’t learn about this sooner. I always knew I was different, from the most meaningless social interaction to the most critical task, whose result now seems as predictable and inevitable as getting wet after jumping into a pool. If I had known, I could have realized what was going on, and made adjustments. How much more could I have accomplished up to this point? Later, while reading the Wikipedia article titled [Asperger Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome), I would feel like I was reading a list of all my traits. Socially awkward. “Check.” Often focuses on small details, you mean that weird thing I always do where I flap my hands is a sign of AS? Well, sensory overload doesn’t affect me too badly. Food is very important to me

Next up is pride. Pride in myself that I made it this far, in that I was exposed to many people who were receptive to my unfamiliar personality. This knowledge, as well as the knowledge that I have a very supportive family, would soon temper my pride with a dash of humility. *Yeah! You fucking rock, man! Wait, did I really just say that?*  

And then, with the same colors, shapes, sounds, and the same people who seem so different from me. And yet, this world around me now feels a bit gentler. A bit less mysterious. Is my life going to improve dramatically, right off the bat? Not likely. I tend to live in a fantasy world, to their greatest extent. Before,False,

1347318394.0,zof2t,A follow up from a few days ago. 27/F and her Aspie 31/M husband.  Had a couple breakthroughs.,girlpriest,25,8,19," [I made this post a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/zkzza/it_was_suggested_that_i_post_this_here_i_really/).  I just want to follow up.

After some really good talks with my husband over the last 48 hours

1)   I have been trying to make him one kind of a husband.  But he is an Aspie husband.  And I need to make him the best THAT that he can be.  I also need to change my behaviour to help change his.  

2)  I want ""planned spontaneity.""  We went for a good walk today and I said, ""Huh!  No, I didn't!  I went on, ""You know how I buy you books on amazon or whatever just because I think you'd like them and then surprise you?""  ""Yeah,"" he agreed.  ""Well, doing little things like that for you is a way that I show and receive love.  It's something I need.  Will you make a point of doing one thing like this for me per week?""  He happily complied!  

3)  This is a big one.  I have to let certain things go and compromise about others.  For example, now?  Can't you see I'm trying to write a screenplay about a boy with a bionic brain whose town has been whisked away by aliens into to space and he must guide it using his superpowers while a power-obsessed principal rules the town with an iron hand?  My agent is waiting for this!!"".  We can go months without him initiating and it is a real sore spot between us.  It really makes me feel unloved.  

So, if he hops in the shower after and comes out to find there is no towel on the rack because it is in the dryer (he would never think to look BEFORE he left) he gets so grumpy and huffy.  Even for the rest of the night.

So, ""I, because I am so nice ;), have brought you your gym clothes!  I also made sure there was clean underwear in your drawer and a dry towel on the rack!""  He looked at me with such affection that I was startled.  

Shortly after, but do you wanna have sex tonight?""  ""Sure!""  he said.  ""Before or after you go to the gym?"" I asked.  ""Ummm, after, "" he said.  ""OK, so that's around 8:30.  You'll finish your work for your agent and then go to the gym before that?""  ""Yup!"" he said.  ""OK!"" I replied.  ""I'll see you at 8:30.

And

I am going to stop looking for him to initiate.  That is not a way he shows love.  He shows love by SHOWING UP.  And I know that if he doesn't want to do something, he doesn't show up.  I am going to focus on creating an environment that is positive in the ways he needs so he can feel comfortable enough to respond to my advances.  He's just not going to be the initiator, so I will compromise.  

4)   I will feed the professor.  Aspie people absorb knowledge of their pet subjects.  This is a man who writes academic styled essays about little know and dreadful B movie directors like Coleman Francis.  (I am not even making this up.)  And he does it simply for the joy of writing and expressing his passions.  He is not a student.  He is not published anywhere.  He gets of on sharing knowledge and helping people to see and understand the world. A natural professor who finds sharing and expanding other's minds a joy.  

I will feed this instead of resist this.  As we made love tonight, including a vibrator in our interactions.  And he said, as we are in the midst of sex, ""I was reading and interesting article today about the history of the vibrator....blah blah blah.....developed by medical doctors...blah blah...girl orgasms are weird, etc.""  Usually, I would get ticked off and say, ""I don't wanna talk about this NOW.""  But instead, ""The female orgasms is very interesting.  Have you ever heard about the theory of 'upsuck'?  It's the idea that....blah blah.""  With the Professor fed

I am 27 years old, what separates us from NTs, and what we all share since I rediscovered my heart after finding you, and I have come to a number of conclusions and ideas on which I would be so incredibly happy to receive your feedback.

The first seems self-evident: under the right set of circumstances, as well.

The second is that our social skills are viewed in a damning, and then introduced into a solid community of self-aware spectrum people, social skills would never present a problem, because we would then be permitted to go about our lives in ways that make sense to us, that work for us. With a framework in place to discover what this would actually look like, the freedoms and fluidity that so terribly few of us are now afforded in the world would come as naturally as the seasons.

The third, as what other option is there when those interested in helping us (assuming with a burning heart for sake of argument that all of the professionals that study us have our best interests in mind) are forced to look around the problem - through the veil, so to speak. They cannot know how our minds function; they are not us! They can only take note of patterns and ways that we diverge from the rest of the human population. And let's face it, patterns are not exactly an NT strong suit  : )

This is not the way! It seems evident to me that we need to have intense dialogue among ourselves to discover how we want and need to be treated, and through this effort, the world.

I understand some of the difficulties

My dreams are currently two-fold: 

1.) For all of us to become supremely confident in ourselves to the point that it becomes unthinkable for us to fail to constantly be aware of what we do well and how incredibly powerful we all are, would create a strong, vibrant community that would allow us to not only survive - trying to hang curtains in our individual prison cells - but to thrive!

2.) To create centers of learning and study that are specifically tailored to these new ways of understanding ourselves that would allow us to bravely engineer a new reality for our planet. New systems of governance and management with social principles and justices in place that would gain the support of the entire lay-population, rather than a single people. New ways of envisioning our existence and ways of moving about it by combining our individual studies of science, philosophy, mathematics, art and expression, et al, into one unprecedented

I think we are all of us sleeping X-Men. I think we are all of us powerful beyond measure. I know that this is an attainable future. One day I want a pronouncement of autism or Asperger's to turn heads and drop jaws, will very likely leave the world bettered in their wake.

Long story short, particularly Asperger's, but I never really pursued treatment until now, seeing a therapist regularly and the fact that I am performing incredibly poorly in school. I talked with my therapist yesterday and brought in [this paper](http://www.help4aspergers.com/pb/wp_a58d4f6a/images/img244154ad237783e339.JPG), where I had circled about 77% of the traits as characteristic of me. I had also taken several quizzes online, including a very in-depth one whose name I've forgotten (it's the one that produces a 14-page .pdf of your results and analysis) and scored an Aspie score of 156/200. I took that test after the therapist appointment, so I didn't show her that.

Long story short, and I get bad social anxiety and much prefer being by myself. I did grow up very close to my family, so I think that's how I learned a lot of social skills (yes a weird oxymoron in that I have an unhealthy childhood but was close to my family...I didn't realize that it was an unhealthy upbringing until just recently and I haven't totally cut off my family). And I was very much into online gaming so I learned a lot of cues from the conversations there as well. I didn't think that it was a ""requirement"" for all Aspies to have poor social skills (and I apologize if I offend anyone who matches this description, I honestly don't meant to hurt people's feelings) but I feel that I match up in a lot of the other aspects of it.

My therapist suggested that I am just going through a form of PTSD. I do agree with that because I can trigger so badly, but I have always exhibited the Aspie tendencies which are concerning me now. Is it possible to have both and right now they're just getting muddled up with each other? I've also had severe depression issues in the past.

The reason I would like a formal diagnosis is because I am doing very, as in borderline flunking out, and it would be nice to be able to work with the learning center here on campus to overcome my difficulties in my classes. I exhibit a lot of [point #3](http://www.lbctnz.co.nz/sld/aspergers/educating.html) in this article and I quite honestly don't know how to fix this on my own and, like I said, I don't even know if I'll be able to graduate next spring. I would like to access the support center on campus to work specifically on learning strategies geared towards my personal issues so hopefully I can do well. I also want to go to grad school after my bachelor's, but my GPA right now is so poor, so it would be nice to try to fix that before applying to grad school so I could show that I am able to learn

My therapist said that if I don't improve in a few months, I don't have a few months to wait and see if it gets any better. I'm already struggling in my summer classes and this final year, starting in August, is not going to get any better. I know that everything takes time, but I seriously don't want to go through another hellish semester while wondering if this PTSD/depression counseling will help my learning incapability.

For the past four years I've been very bold with approaching girls and people have complemented me for it. It isn't hard for me to get a girls phone number or her facebook page. The only problem is the next step. In the past I used to be given fake phone numbers a lot so I came up with a strategy where I tell her to let me call her so she can get my number to. Almost always a girl doesn't answer her phone or respond to a text message. I thought using facebook would be more casual and less ""threatening"" to a girl but almost always they accept my friend request but never respond if I try to talk to them. Many situations are really bizarre such as me meeting a girl and we have some unusual interests in common and seem to really connect

I fell like the only person in the world where getting a girls phone number or making plans is actually a sad situation. As soon as something like that happens I feel bad because I just know she is going to do what the rest do. It's almost as if I'm handed a bomb and I need to defuse it and one wrong move and there is an explosion.

Up until a few months ago I thought the problem was being a virgin. I was obsessed with wanting to get rid of the awful v word and people told me that was my problem. I only told people about my curse if I was very close to them however I felt girls could sense it somehow and thought I was a freak. A few months ago I received pity sex from a female friend and I felt like I escaped a concentration camp. I knew things were going to get better and I had a ""fuck buddy."" Well the sex time period was short (she got a boyfriend so we had to stop (we are still friends though)) and as time went on I realized that wasn't the only problem. Besides being not obsessed with ""when will it end"" everything else isn't that different. I'm still in pretty much the same situation with women.

What really bothers me is I work with a girl who if it weren't for the fact she were in a relationship I would ask her out. Her boyfriend is a complete scumbag and according to her

I'm sick and tired of all the same advice. Can someone tell me something I haven't heard that can help me? Can someone help me end the perpetual hell of false hope?

1338177059.0,u87jl,A summary of my current social situation.,,19,3,6,"**TLDR: I'm not the most popular guy on the block. I prefer computers to human interaction. School assignments are difficult to juggle


Hey, I barely have a social life when you compare it to the lives of my peers. While other's go out to party and hang out with friends, I stay in the safety of my home and hang out with my computer (which isn't half bad, considering all the incredible games and websites out there, but you know what I'm getting at). 

I'm currently 15 years old. High school status. At the time where your popularity points start to become more important, and things that others would consider ""nerdy"" or ""weird"" are often the main points of our conversations. They don't have Aspergers, they're as NT as the other kids in my school. But they understand and respect me, as I do to them. When I told them about my condition, they continued to be the best of friends, and not once have they looked down on me.

I know other people who are still good friends, I don't see why someone would ever want to be popular. I mean, it all sounds like a lot of pointless work, trying to be someone you're not just to appeal to a certain audience. Why should I lose a part of me just to fit in? I'd rather stay who I am then lose my soul to some group of idiots. 

Now, but I hear everything. I can hear the intense social demands of today's generation. Everything from staying informed on the latest gossip, to the slang terms and dirty jokes that just go beyond me. I see people talking in groups, laughing. I hear something being said, something that appears so innocent to me, and yet the entire group of people suddenly become offended. 

I don't understand it. I don't understand what it was that offended them. Sometimes I wonder if I'm completely oblivious to conversational norms, I don't usually talk to ""outsiders"" at all, really. About 95% of my day is spent with my two best friends. Which suits me just fine. 

At least they don't think I'm weird. Most of the people I see don't understand me. They jump to conclusions. People mock me as I walk down the halls. Not always

I don't think I even did anything to deserve such embarrassment. Well, I'll often run (or at least fast-walk) down the halls. But no, apparently those who move faster than the masses are fools, and should be treated accordingly. Whenever I run down the halls, I get these weird looks as if I just did something horribly wrong; almost as if I were going mad. I don't understand it. Is running really that big of a deal? At least I won't be late. 

That's something I don't get about society. People have tons of issues that could be fixed with simple, so they basically throw away logic and replace it with these stupid rules and regulations.

Anyway, I interact just fine. But add in more people, and instantly I'll go from being semi-normal to being completely alien to the rest of them. It's like my brain freaks out and starts making stupid jokes and laughing at everything and suddenly acting so juvenile....it's very counter-productive in terms of not looking like a human freak.

School in itself is generally harder for me. I mean, but when I'm suddenly thrown a page of questions from one class, and a project in the other, all with different due dates, it gets complicated. It might not sound that bad to you, but even without the workload, my brain is constantly going everywhere. It wanders from topic to topic, and adding the pressures of school and society only make it worse. I don't know if that's an AS thing or I'm just going insane.

Like I said before, meaning I'd gladly trade human interaction for the fastest computer in the world. Heck, I'd even trade for a half decent computer. As long as it plays all my favorite games. I don't know what I'd do without video games. They act as an escape. They let me enter another world, where I become the hero. A place where I can control everything around me. A place where everything runs as expected, with no sudden changes. Best of all, there are no real life people to get in my way. It's an entire world to myself. Games like Skyrim are good for this. Having a vast, open-concept map to explore and do whatever you want in is amazing. Sometimes I wish I could live in those fantasy worlds. Live alongside the NPCs I've come to know so well. Barter with familiar shopkeepers, fight dragons. 

People don't really understand my relationship with games. Some think video games are juvenile. Some think they are a waste of time. They think my fantasies of living in the game worlds are childish and stupid. And I don't blame them. This is the world they belong in, so my dreams soar to fictional worlds and fantasy kingdoms. As long as I keep my dreams to myself, I should be fine.

Each time I think I'm finally getting the hang of social skills a little better, ever since graduation, I'm looking how to fit into a new culture so to speak and I'm failing, badly.

Of course, being a bit too idealistic etc. Fine, so far it's normal. But for me, the rejections kept coming despite a double MA, being trilingual, decent appearance and what I consider to be an honest and respectful character.

Numerous rejections later, except the occasional ""team player"" aspect that some HR departments tend to overplay a little. But it's my personality that they dislike ... or better yet, it's what they perceive to be my personality in those 20min to 1hr interviews. First I'm too negative, too skeptic, too critical, too introvert... so when I try to be more positive, I'm suddenly not showing enough stress during interviews and I'm seen as too arrogant. I sincerely can not find the right way to appear to interviewers... The right amount of exterior enthusiasm, it's so hard.

Sometimes I try to explain that I do have faith in my analytic skills, even if I directly explain to them that the way I act during interviews is just another way of coping.

A counselor (MFCC) suggests autism.  She thought asperger’s syndrome as a possible diagnosis.  I participated in multiple online tests.  The result being AS is a good start for a label

After finding some better tests and focusing on the subject I started to see how I might operate a brain on AS.  One more interesting thing about my wetware; I already operate a brain on dyslexia.  I am a psychologist’s wet dream.

I started to examine my mental behaviors, mimic what we call “NT” behavior?  The last question was what the, is neurotypical?

I spent over 20 years functioning as they say “high” while performing chemical research in the biotech pharmaceutical industry.  I started a family

I am well versed in the art of problem solving.  Research chemistry is all about problem solving.  This has been of great help to me as I processed the above questions to self diagnose.

Something was just off plum.  A splinter in the matrix as Morpheus says to Neo just before he chooses his future and eats the pill.  My pill was labeled asperger’s syndrome/dyslexia.  The splinter was thinking I was normal.  This was a 180-degree twist to my reality and a falling down the rabbit hole experience followed.

I'm pretty bad at recognising faces. I'm not sure, and when I meet her at the station and she comes up to me I'm usually not quite sure whether it's her or just someone who looks like her until she gives me a hug. But then if I stay with her for a while, I'm more able to recognise her after the first day.

*Anyway*, but today there have been three incidents. Firstly, this morning my girlfriend got some new passport photos taken and she texted me a picture of them. The thing is... I didn't recognise her in the photo at all! I think it's because her glasses were off and her hair was brushed back more than normal... but this is a person I see all the time (even on days when I don't see her in person - I have a photo of her in my wallet and photos on my wall and she's usually my desktop background... so I see her face several times every day). I usually really like looking at photos of her, so it felt a bit sad that looking at this one felt a bit like ""who's that?"".

Then later on I was walking along and I thought I saw my friend (call him P). We were walking towards one another on the pavement and from the moment I spotted him until he was nearly next to me I was really sure it was P. I usually let other people make the first move in social situations (it just makes things easier), and this guy was shorter, but if it hadn't been for that, I would be sitting here wondering why he didn't say hi to me when I passed him. But this happens quite a lot, so it wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't for the other incidents today.

Then I got to my room and looked on Facebook and my sister had posted some photos from some sort of event she went to with some friends. She isn't in most of them (I think she was taking the photos)

I know everyone sees unusual photos and doesn't recognise the person at first, so I usually don't mind. But right now I feel like I can't recognise my *girlfriend*, my *best and oldest friend*, or my *sister*, and I kind of wish I didn't have a brain that works this way :(

I've always felt different and was never understood by my classmates at school. Have always been very tired from social interaction and have had are rather sensitive to sensory input.
I am so happy as can now ask for help in situations where I feel I need help (looking for a job).


My parents are very loving and have always tried to help me in every way I needed help, living together with my Auti boyfriend.


Like I said, even for us with AS. My boyfriend and I understand eachother, and help eachother when needed. I can't imagine a life without him :)

Protecting that which probably doesn't need protecting that which probably doesn't need protecting: Having established an encryption method it seems only natural to consider applying an encryption rule that feeds from (perhaps even recursively) other unstructured information. For example: say you have the string ""aBZ"" and the number 123 as a encryption key, b by 2 etc. Now let's say you have a string that's 33+ (size relevant to the example key, such that mod key.length is required (33 mod 32 = 1, therefor in this example string character 33 would be offset by the first digit of the key)), you may decide to concatenate two bank card numbers (32 digits) and apply them to the string in question resulting in a communicable string that would be very difficult to decipher without knowledge of the 32 digit key.

In summary; if I learnt nothing else from this experience I discovered that the skills that others have lead me to believe are confounding may also be only the beginning of their potential.

In 1999, I started learning HTML on my own. In 2005, I enrolled in a Visual Basic class at my high school. In May 2006, I graduated from high school. In May 2008, I received an Associate's degree in programming. In December 2010, I received a Bachelor's degree cum laude in information systems.

While I haven't been diagnosed yet, I have all kinds of trouble reading people's social cues or body language, my own body language is all over the place and very rarely represents what I'm actually feeling, I will occasionally blurt out things that are on my mind but aren't appropriate for a conversation without thinking about it, the whole fun package.

But most of all, and I don't really even understand it.  Before my therapist suggested I had AS I had actually identified as aromantic for a while.  A lot of my Facebook friends are getting engaged and married right now, and everyone's excited and gushing and omg so happy!!, and I... feel nothing, except maybe confusion at how someone could get so attached to another person that they would want to make that much of a commitment to them.

Which would be fine, honestly.  The few times I've seen a woman semi-consistently they have invariably fallen in love with me, I've stuck with it hoping that ""well, maybe it will be different this time and I will feel something,"" I don't, and they eventually can't take the emotional neglect anymore and leave.  I realize this is partially my fault, which is why I don't date much anymore and when I do I'm petrified to flirt or make any kind of moves for fear that the woman will get attached.

I don't really know what to do.  The bar scene will absolutely not work for me because the mere thought of going to a bar or a club gives me sensory overload to the point where I want to run away crying.  Online dating doesn't really work either, I can do that at home myself.

* I had a very traumatic childhood because of undiagnosed AS
* For someone with Aspergers, but have a very high level of *sympathy.*  So I always *wanted* friends as a kid, but I kept getting rejected by them and I just didn't know why.  
* The result is that I've been disappointed so much in friendships and relationships that I've given up hope altogether.  It was explained to me like this by the doctor:  
""Often we find in physically abusive childhood relationships, not having hope is less painful.  But the problem is that you need hope to be mentally healthy.""  
* Many of the Asperger's ""strengths"" don't work out in my favor.  Because I am very highly intelligent (I have an IQ of 140, become an engineer"" type of aspie.  Which sucks because things like particle physics, robotics, engineering - they're very interesting.  But I'll never be good at them because I can't hack the math.  According to the doctor, my logical mind would probably make me very good at practicing law (but there's no market for lawyers right now) or with becoming a stockbroker (which is something I never considered and don't even know how to break into - and it doesn't really interest me all that much.) I work in marketing communications, and I suppose that's okay.  
* In addition to my Aspergers
* What I need are ""reparative"" relationships. Good experiences.  Especially with women. But it's hard enough for a NT guy to meet women... I'd have to find someone willing to put up with me
* I was expecting to find out I had aspergers.  I *wasn't* expecting to find out that I had mental deficiencies in mathematics or that my depression isn't based on neurochemistry but rather on learned behaviors and a lifetime of emotional abuse by my peers.  So my depression and social anxiety may one day be cured and I can be medication-free.  IF I can succeed at social relationships

So basically, and an aspie.  I have depression related to trauma which I thought couldn't be cured - but I know know can be cured, but only by succeeding at the things that I have no ability whatsoever to do. 

At first I was elated because I finally figured out that what was wrong with me had a *name.*  But I'm looking at how much I'd have to accomplish, and I'm thinking that maybe I should just give up.  

It's a sobering thought - my most likely outcome is dying alone and unloved.  Which is also my greatest fear.

* I have defaulted student loans
* I lose jobs frequently.
* Despite being in one of the most lucrative careers in today's economy (programmer) I frequently am completely broke due to downtime with no contracts and no job
* I have so many different self-improvement routines in place that they all interfere with each other.  
* There are so many books I've started reading and never finished it's ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong - I think you can usually drop a book at about 80% and be fine but I also have lots of books at about 5%.
* I'm frequently late for meetings.  
* I have many different non-overlapping ""life goals"" such as ""go to space"" and ""run a restaurant"" and ""become a therapist"".  
* My buddy asked me ""whats the most important thing in your life?"" and I said something like ""right now I'm focusing on keeping you entertained"".

It's only been very recently - within the past month about - that I have been holding the hypothesis that I'm an Aspie.  But it fits like a glove so I'm pretty certain.  

How much of this do you guys experience?  Let's use this thread to share techniques.  For me even though I've got problems they're smaller than they used to be.  Here are some things that have helped me (start to) get my sh*t together:  

* meditation: sit quietly in comfy position, for 5 minutes (use a timer)  
* 5-minute cleaning: again the 5-minute timer, instead of a project.  
* step-by-step planning:  break down objective into intermediate steps.  Keep dividing steps until each is so simple there's no way I could fail or get distracted.  For example, label the top page of each bundle with a brief description of its contents"".  

Amount of time I've been doing these habits:  

* meditation: 10 years (incredibly helpful for reducing anxiety and increasing flexibility of thinking and improving mood)
* 5-minute cleaning: I've been doing this for about 2 years.
* super-detailed sequence planning: only about 4 months

Message Starts Now: 

You know that I'm socially awkward and lack social skills. You know that it’s affected my relationship history. But I wonder if you understand the scope of the effect this has had on me. If only it were as simple as me having trouble with conversations

If nobody understands then that means I'm ""different""

But, do you know what that would mean? It would mean that I'm not so different after all. It would mean that, despite my obvious issues, I was still similar enough to understand, which means that despite how I might fight it, at the end of the day, where I am now is my fault. If, then given adequate time and effort there is no reason that one who lacks social skill shouldn't be able to build the necessary skills and catch up with the other. If

It would mean that years of being alone could have been avoided with only a little more effort. Just that little bit of effort and I wouldn't have spent most of my life feeling like an outcast, maybe I wouldn't have cried myself to sleep at night praying that I would wake up a different person, a person who got along well with others and had a girlfriend. Perhaps, I would be going out with friends more often because I would be willing to ask, and not automatically assume that no-one wants to go anywhere with me. Maybe, I would have had at least one friend see my bedroom in the past 6 years. That is what scares me, the possibility that everything that has happened to me and led me to where I am now

Obviously I'm not like that anymore; I've grown a lot since then. I used to tell absolutely no-one what my feelings were. And had in many ways ""resigned myself to my fate"" to the point that eventually I can honestly say I wondered if I even had feelings. After I moved to {{Place where I am now}}, joining ROTC. When I joined ROTC, it provided a sense of structure to normal communication, making me feel more confident in communicating. It also provided a sense of camaraderie that allowed me to make friends, people that I enjoyed hanging out with and talking to. Now I've had friends before, I wasn't a complete loner but I had never really done anything with others outside the classroom. So this was different and finally felt real. The thing is that structure only applied to people who were apart of ROTC, for everyone else I was still behind. Anyways long story short(er) time went on

Pheww!! That took a while! I'm glad I wrote it though; it’s about time I learned to open up. That's why I never know what to talk about and why I message you so often, I'm just not very good at it yet. I am improving though. That is what it means to be me right now.

So on Thursday of this past week

So I instituted the same punishment as the previous two weekends.

We chose not to take away tv also as a matter of convenience. We were not trying to be shitty parents but life happens. My wife and I are both getting over the flu... neither boy will get the attention they deserve this weekend.

The next option on my list would be to write an essay about the importance of telling the truth and how half-truths are still lies. I would basically give him 5-6 topics and let him hand write it. Then we can revise it and he can type it up. I know once he reads something

Can any of you please share punishments that actually worked on you as a tween (God, he can no longer put the blame on everyone but himself. For example, if the handbook included a rule that says he must have his teeth brushed before 9pm on a school night and before going to bed on Friday and Saturday nights, will he stop saying ""because no one told me to"" when asked why his teeth are not brushed? Same thing for his meds, his laundry, his trash, etc... Unless he is told to do these things, and then college we hope. But if he lives alone in college

My dad, I lived about a mile from the ""Mall.""  I was pretty well in the minority but regardless of residing lower-income housing, I didn't know any better.  The school I went to put me in a minority position as well.  This didn't bode well with my Aspergers.

As for my education I tried to fit in but due to my dad

It was then I started attempting to fit in and rather than do be myself, in the end, it opened my eyes:  I told a racist joke in front of a class of thirty students.  This joke stopped the class and teacher dead in their tracks and prompted the teacher to pull me aside out of the classroom.  She promptly asked me if I had realized what I had done, to which I had responded ""No.""

I had just then insulted seventy percent of the class.  I had then learned what racism was and my life had changed forever.  I had learned a new side of my father and many other people.  I was naïve about this until then and my eyes were opened because I attempted to mimic my father (repeating what he said the way he said it.)

Now I find racism everywhere and despise it.  I find the term African-American racist.  I find the term ""white"" and ""Caucasian"" racist.  I do not teach my children racism; I teach them equality.  In everything I learn my mistakes, living in a few of them [countries] and observing ways of life.  In my travels I have found that the United States is the most racist country I have ever lived in.

I don't know what to think about people - and have become afraid of many of them because of how they look at me.  So many terms are derogatory and their politically-correct terms to change are almost as bad.  It isn't enough to be ""tolerant"" or ""diverse, it will take the United States approximately 240-260 years to get past racism, which is unfortunate, and I am being conservative with those numbers.  :(

I have always had problems with motivation and I find that although I am able to rationally understand that what I do now matters for my future I don't actually really care about it and as a result I struggle a lot with doing anything that I do not want to do right now.

This has had quite a large negative impact on school life because I pretty much never do homework or revision and as a result tend not to get the grades I should. I actually do well in exams normally because I seem to just remember things a lot of the time but when it comes down to getting coursework done I don't do well. I am now at the end of my school life - I have 3 exams left - and am hopefully moving on to college (in the English sense - not university) next year and am worried that this is going to make things difficult.

I spend a large amount of my time programming (computing is my passion) but I find that sometimes I can't even persuade myself to do that - even in a situation where I am in the middle of a really interesting project. 

Does anyone else have these issues? And if so

**Possible software project**

I've been wondering recently about whether there could be a way I could use my ability in computing to help myself and/or others with Aspergers and I thought this might be a good place to ask for inspiration.

Is there anything in the way of a piece of software that you think might help you with problems caused by Aspergers? Would you be interested in this idea?

I'm not making any promises to do anything but if people are interested in this then I would be willing to work on it as a project and would make anything I created freely available here. While I would consider myself a capable programmer it is also worth noting that I'm not yet formally trained so I make no promises about my ability.

But now that he is older he is getting to be more creative and I can't tell the difference between his Aspie issues with certain foods and his being a pain in the butt 7 year old not wanting to eat the healthy stuff.  For example - he has always liked bananas.  All of a sudden he hates them.  Is this a legit thing or is he being a pain?  

And he is stubborn as hell.  He had 4 bites of bananas to eat with his lunch.  (a peanut butter sandwich - which he lives on btw).  He knew if he didn't eat them, and is now chilling out in his room.  Refused to even look at them.  He wont try ANYTHING new, and will break down completely if I push him too hard to try something else, as well as just go hungry.  Since I am not in the habit of starving my kid, I usually just make him a sandwich and give him some fruit snacks and leave it at that.

All he eats basically is:  Peanut butter sandwiches (NO JELLY).  Cereal (from cheerios to fruit loops he likes a lot of them, goldfish, pretzels. Grilled cheese (with american cheese).  He used to like bananas and dried pineapples and raisins but now he wont go near any of it.  He wont touch fruit juice except at school, in his lunch he gets a caprisun.  He lives on milk or chocolate milk or water. 

 His bread and cereals and whatnot are fortified with vitamins and minerals and his doc says not to worry about it...But I do worry about it.  He's miserable when we go out to eat somewhere, but he just says NOPE. and thats it.

BEWARE this is going to be long.

I'm 22. 

I should say before you read anything

I have no true friends

I feel that my life has been falling apart. I've always

I've been an outcast all of my life. I've been looked down on

I feel that karma has something against me. I've always gotten the short end of the stick, none last a week. 

I had my first somewhat long-term relationship 3 months ago. Then she ended it. It started with ""I can see being with you for a long time."" to ""I hate being around you

I have recently finally found a beautiful woman that is actually interested in the same things as I am. That is amazing to be around and is falling for me. 

Something popped up... Herpes. Now there's no chance for me and this amazing woman. She doesn't want to catch anything permanent she's too young. 

I asked the other woman WTF and she denied, but I've always been the level-headed one, the tough one. I have no one to talk to about it. I have no true friend that can help me. 

My living situation has gone to hell. I have a job making a measly 300 every two weeks. I'm living with my mom, but when I notice I apologize. I try so hard to not be mean. My brother's grades are failing. He's bullied at school. He's following the same path I have in my life. It breaks my heart so much that i've turned into a hardass to try to help. WHAT DO I DO?

I try to love my life

* What are your tastes in music?

* Why do you listen to music?

* What's the most important part of music?


I'll start:

* I am pretty open-minded. I like mainly heavy metal, some jazz, the occasional dubstep song, some opera, etc. Epica is currently my obsession. The lead singer is also sexy as hell.

* I listen to music for many reasons. It is one of the main influences of my mood, panic-inducing walls of epic. The reason is because I have a slight bit of chronic anxiety and while some may argue that type of music is fuel for it, in a very odd way, it kind of gives my anxiety something to concentrate on.

* For me, if the lyrics are really sad, but the mood of the song does not reflect that, then the song has no meaning for me. I like to hear every nook and cranny of a song, and pay attention to the finer details. Thus, I tend to listen to music as loud as whatever speaker system lets me.

I have theories about it. 

The first is that I don't know how to show sexual attraction towards someone and that makes it ambiguous if I am attracted or not. Except when I had the phase to think that it was seducing to look someone right in the eyes for a long time

The second is that my lack of confidence make's me look really unsure and all. I don't really know what it means but it's a theory someone suggested me that I could look a bit too unsure of what to do so it makes me look asexual.

The third one would be that I respect women ""too much"" (never can we respect someone too much but still) and that makes me look like I have no sexual drive. This would be coupled with the fact that I rarely talk about sex but when I do

It seems like I see the world differently and that I think in a different way. At least that's the impression I've gotten over the course of my life. I feel like I'm much more rigid, plans and structure. I prioritise interests over people. I'm quiet and speak only when I have something to say (if I can find a good way to communicate it).

I also feel like I notice things and that people don't really bother to observe their surroundings. The psychologist who decided I'm definitely going to get assessed for ASD said I'm undoubtedly very observant. I love observing things and noticing details. I often look for details. One of my favourite things to do is to sit on the bus (if no one's sitting next to me that is) with one song on repeat (over and over and over again) in my ears

Sometimes I also feel like I take the time to appreciate nature more than most people. When I walk outside I often think of what I'm breathing (the elements), why the sky is blue, why my eyes see the sky as blue, why I see colours, if we all perceive colours the same way, that it's taken light 8 minutes to get here from the sun etc. I think about these things frequently and when I tell people about it they think I'm weird. Most people seem to think only of ""shallow"" things. I'm not saying all people are like that but that's the impression I've gotten from most people. I don't think like they do. Sometimes I might but most of the time I don't. Perhaps that's not the case but someone's yet to prove me wrong.

In elementary school I was a spelling genius, and I had late work piled up so thick it was like a textbook. In first grade I never spoke to anyone (not an exaggeration), and I only had about 2 or 3 friends at any given time.

In middle school I was the weird kid who sat in the corner in gym class and infodumped about pokemon with the other weird kid. I couldn't throw, and I would be the only one in the class reacting that way while everyone just sat and stared. I also had this habit of chewing on pens/erasers, so much to the point where they broke every few weeks.

In high school I started to get more social

Life with my parents was also difficult. They didn't understand me at all. They thought my weirdness was because I was being mean or manipulative which was definitely not the case. Though they loved me very much (and I them), they would often set me off on meltdowns, so much that it was hurting our relationship.

In college I finally started to get assimilated into the social world, etc.). That doesn't mean I coasted through like a boss, however. Some of my narrow obsessions got too intense for a friend of mine and she yelled at me, saying it was annoying and a little creepy, so I kinda went off on her. Though she didn't want to talk to me, I was very remorseful and kept trying to fix things with her, often messaging her and her relatives every day on multiple social networking sites because I thought she had blocked me. All I wanted to do was hear her accept my apology, however

Hi, what am I saying?  ON WITH IT!!!....

I'm classified as aspie (right support group this time, inflections &amp; mannerisms in different situations, monitoring reactions, sometimes I change my looks, playing with social &amp; verbal context, subtext and pretext, maybe finding where people's limits are and/or challenging them to think, I'd characterize it as being like a scientist on an observational mission to document species interactions and routines

One of my favorite social costumes is the one I change my looks for; I have long curly hair, even get hit on by butch lesbians who mistake me for one of their own, until they see the adam's apple that is (I'm a gay male btw). There is nothing more interesting to me than seeing people's eyes twitch and get vaguely unfocused, you can almost hear their hard-drive cycle into the [click of death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWR34wKBNS0) when presented with a being they don't know how to categorize, how it bucks the monkey-brain sense of familiarity and incites paranoia or curiousity depending upon one's mindset. It's also interesting to observe the wide variance in reaction to the pitch of one's voice.  If I lower to baritone, people are nicer to me and seem to want to engage more, if I go back to base soprano setting there is a much higher incidence of deferential and/or avoidant behavior and signs of nervous tenseness though most of that disappears if I have a beard.  People are strange creatures.

I also like to play around with alpha-male-type hierarchy personality types and see how people react to someone who is politely assertive and outspoken versus someone who is very softspoken and deferential.  Sometimes I like to use diametrically opposite personality types serially on folks I'm never likely to meet again just to see how they react.  Some of them tweak right out and get nervous (in which case I back off) and some of them adapt quite impressively with the flow.  I generally end up liking these types.

Some have told me that this is attention-seeking behavior on my part

  I feel fortunate that having these talents has enabled me to adapt really well socially (except when I'm feeling drained and want to be alone to recharge).  I'll also add in that I sometimes use these tools to manipulate people but usually in a good way to lead them to answers and resources which they are in need of because some things seriously can't be expressed in language, which has to be one of the most unique compliments I've ever received. I suppose it reciprocates some of the mind-fuck in a way.

If someone say they're meeting me somewhere a specific time and they're not there at the time I get anxious and I can't do anything but stim/pace until they arrive. If I make plans with someone I can't relax until the plans has gone through and if the plans change I get nervous. A lot of times the plans I make with someone don't go through and i I'll me stuck doing nothing because I can't reschedule free time on a time already scheduled for something else.

Having a SO I've noticed is more stressful than what I thought, because of some of the things he does sometimes makes me want to break up with him. I've explained to him multiple times that if were having a conversation by text messages, he can't just randomly not answer and ignore me for hours without telling me that he will be busy, because it makes me anxious and stressed out, he keeps doing it,  starts a conversation, texts me two messages or so and then completely ignores me for hours, if something happened to him
He usually gives the excuse of him being stressed out and that is why he forgets to answer. But he doesn't seem to understand that I get stressed over him not responding.

My brother can be extremely rude sometimes. He can also be very nice sometimes. A typical day for him is to have my mom wake him up every morning &amp; have him refuse to go to school. If she does get him to go, but usually he doesn't let her, or she doesn't take it away. He usually gets whatever he wants when he wants it. His behavior can be really obnoxious sometimes. For example, the other day I was trying to finish an art project by pulling an all-nighter &amp; he insisted on mocking me &amp; trying to annoy me. It seemed like he didn't care even when I was getting upset. He does this a lot, only to the point where he won't leave until he gets bored. 

He is also very clingy to my mom. He always wants to give her hugs, but he hardly ever talks to him anymore. He has some at school, but doesn't want them to come over to our house. Is him being so attached to my mom because he doesn't have many friends?

I worry about him, for example him being bullied).

He is a VERY smart guy, because when I talk to my mom about it the only things she tells me is that people with aspergers have a harder time giving empathy, and get irritated easily (which both of these seem to explain him pretty well).

I know that it is especially strong with anything involving animals (this, presumably at different times, walked unknowingly into the lethal electrical charge.  That pic made me really sad.  I felt bad for the emotional ache the owners would feel.  (I assumed they felt an emotional attachment to the animals, like I do with my cat, when they very well could only have been hurt monetarily by the deaths.)

As I said, concrete examples of completely real, nature empathy outside of things having to do with animals.  Maybe I do have less empathy than the normal person? (I'm just writing stream of consciousness, I haven't even gotten to what I WANTED to write about.  I really like having this sub to talk about aspie things that I can't talk about with other people, and thank you to those who read, even though I don't have an actual point in the end of this thing...just talking about myself!)  I can remember trying to force myself to feel bad for people in emotionally rough situations.  This friend of mine in high school struggled with self harm and bulimia and I knew that I cared about her, and I knew that I wanted her to feel better...but I didn't actually feel any emotional attachment to her emotional state.  I didn't REALLY want to listen to her.  But I'd feel guilty for that.  

My emotion in that situation reflects many of the ""learned"" emotions or reactions I have.  Self taught feeling and thoughts that I've learned from NTs I should have when I hear bad news about someone

Not missing people is the only really solid area where I can point out and say ""hey, I don't know why people care, I feel no guilt about not caring.""

""Byes"" me nothing to me.  I worked at a summer camp for the past few summers and at the end every year people are always teary eyed and hugging good bye and every year I dread it because I really would just rather leave.  I got my license a couple years late and so finally

Later it turned out some people were pretty annoyed about that.

I don't get it.  Most of them I'd see again, I would.  If we hardly knew each other, we hardly knew each other, there was no reason to pretend like we did.  It is the same with all good byes.  I will see you again.  If I don't, I don't.  

Sometimes, she wasn't sick for a long time or anything, so my last words to her were just normal everyday stuff.  That has never bothered me.  I never felt I need ""closure"" or ""to say goodbye.""  She was gone, that was it.  Having been able to say good bye a last time wouldn't change anything about that or anything about everything that has happened since.

My sister is moving across the world in a week and I really don't care.  I'll see her again in 2 years.  Okay.  That is fine.  I am not emotionally close to her.  When we spend time together (occasionally) it is enjoyable but she isn't someone I actively try to spend more time with.  But the family of course has been calling me and making sure I'll be coming to all the family get togethers and grandparent dinners over the next week

I go out of my way to accept the affection he offers on his own terms. But I am also a person with my own needs. I need to feel emotional connection and acceptance. I need physical closeness and I often am left feeling my affection is an intrusion on his work. It is very difficult to get him to open up and talk about his emotions. When I try, rarely offering me insight into his true thoughts and feelings (outside of the realms of art and ideas.) He very rarely cries.

Being an animator

After the film, a very gentle kid with a fierce love of all things monster related. Norman can see and talk to dead people. He is mocked for this by both family and the people in the community. He is very lonely and often bullied. His parents just want him to be a normal kid. They can't recognize his ""weirdness"" as a kind of superpower.

My husband loved film, his mind is like a trap. He is very successful in his career and it is a deep part of who he is.

He was constantly chided by his father and largely misunderstood by his mother. ""Why can't you just draw nice things, cult.) Sameness was the name of the game. You didn't have your own thoughts and opinions. If you did you had a ""bad attitude.""

He told me at school he was quite bullied. He went through some awkward years

When Nightmare Before Christmas came out, thinking demonic thoughts and told he was stupid for desiring something like that. ""You have a bad attitude"" was a common refrain.

At this point, ""It seems like you grew up in a home where you really weren't able to express yourself."" He answered, ""Oh, I expressed myself. I couldn't help it. I have the bruises to prove it."" We determined that this is probably why he rarely shares his deepest thoughts with me, especially if they are scary or sad. What I experience as being rejected emotionally by him is really just him having years of training to shove those feelings down deep and not tell them to anyone.

Does anyone have any advice for living with and loving someone like this? I don't want to be another person in his life who makes him feel weird. But I do want to know him deeply and have him share himself intimately with me, are met. But I need to do that in a way that doesn't send a message that he, as he is, isn't good enough for me. Please help me. We have been on the verge of breaking up lately because I feel so lonely and neglected by the man I love.

---------------

First off, and wanted to confirm/deny it.

[This girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Z4iqrezAU) talks about these 3 types

An important element she discusses is that our condition doesn't prohibit us from adapting.  I, albeit for over 10 years, how to transform from an outcast to an actor.  I certainly still have issues, but I now see the value AND enjoy socializing.  People tend to enjoy what they're good at, and I think many aspies hate socializing as a defense/coping mechanism.

I started to struggle when I reached my A Levels, I don't work, I don't socialise or anything. My psychologists solution to this was to just tell me to ""go and meet people"". Obviously that's difficult for *anyone* let alone someone with ASD. After a few months she said ""I think it's best I stop seeing you, we're getting nowhere and it's wasting my time"".

This experience has obviously jaded my views and has put me off from seeing professionals. The problem arises when I am worried I suffer from things other than just ASD. I don't wish to go to a professional though

I suffer from severe paranoia

After taking a few different tests and quite a lot of reading, Borderline, Avoidant, Dependant and Obsessive-Compulsive.

On top of this, this coupled with my lack of desire to see a professional makes me wonder if there's much point in looking into seeing someone? I've been having an extremely difficult time coping lately, and to add to the above, both my sister and father insult me and use my ASD to attack me as they don't believe there's any such thing. I feel hopeless and lost currently, having no friends or anyone to talk to, and no form of support for my problems; either from friends, family or local authorities/charities. 

One thing that makes things slightly more difficult is my 100% reluctance to take any form of medication. The many side effects of medication used for these types of things scares me and I would prefer to avoid it completely.

1375362850.0,1jhpib,Recently found out I have aspergers: Something I need to get off my chest and what to do now?,Aspie138,19,7,16,"Hello all

Well

I have always felt that I have had something different and off about me ever since I was five years old. I remember developing this OCD type of disorder at the age of five. I still remember it vividly, walk a certain number, or even swallow my food without thinking of ""good things"". 

I'll give you an example of the hell I dealt with: When I was ten I couldn't touch my left knee without my brain (that's what I call the voice) threatening me and scaring me by telling me that if I don't touch my right knee after having touched my left knee, horror movie scenarios happening in real life). 

Other than my OCD and the voice ruining my life for a bit. I have always been that ""weird""  kid in school that everyone would love to pick on and stray away from. I was always a quite shy type. Each grade year varied as to how weird I would be. I remember wearing a sweater all year round (even through the summer) in grade school up to high school. Kids in school would refer to me as that weird/ crazy/ dumb/shy kid due to the fact that would do the most eccentric things (carry a Halloween mask to school/ bury a dead bird in elementary / make jokes about irrelevant things that no one got ).I would go to classrooms and take a seat staring down and not talking to anybody due to my fear of opening up and being judged. When it came to teachers in HIGH SCHOOL, but I couldn't find the comfort in doing so. I would stand alone in lunch as a freshmen in high school lost in my own world. I came up with a lot of creative stories and such in my head as I stood alone in lunch away from the ordinary people. I just couldn't understand how one socialized, I was trapped in a shell that couldn't let me be normal. 

The things I say to people, I get really shy and tend to hold back a lot of things I would want to say. Sometimes I would say things to people but later on tell myself ""man I should have mentioned this! or that!"" ""why did I say it that way?! Now they are gonna think I was being an asshole!"" The list goes on and on... I have always questioned how one socializes. I always, in my life, never understood or grasped the concept behind being a ""normal"" person. I have honestly tried really hard to do normal things but in the end I always end up being this ""weird"" person I am. All I want out of this is to just be a ""regular"",  just another spoke on the wheel much like everyone else, but the act of speaking and being comfortable around others without worrying too much really gets to me.

Now I am 21 years turning 22. Here's the thing. I felt that I have missed out on a lot of things in life that normal people have accomplished in their younger days. I was never really the type of outdoor-socially-weekend -party- adventuring  teenager due to my inability to gain friends in high school. I missed out on a lot of fun times with my friends. I hear them describe the stories of when they partied and had fun back in high school and college and it depresses me because I wasn't there. It's these thoughts that make me sad because I am living in the present and I can't change the past. Time fucking sucks. Basically

Overall, society is far too up its ass and that you can't be something without having people preach or bitch about what you do. I have way more to say but I will leave it as that. Just shed some light and give me some advice.

oh and I am left handed too (left handed in everything).
