Everything seems to load faster, it never bugs up and doesn't let me click buttons or scroll on pages, and, on top of that, I get a cool new UI.

If you want to try this

I recommend using the skin [PixelVision](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1914848) as well.

The only bug I have noticed is that some of the icons in the top bar are slightly off

For some reason installing skins on the OS X version isn't completely supported so its a bit harder to get working

Once again

If any of you guys try this let me know if it makes your Steam run faster!

1334050620.0,s2bqz,[HOWTO] Update The Witcher: Enhanced Edition engine,WhiteMouse,59,6,31,"As you know

In any case, but I've highlighted the important note here:

&gt;  The Witcher: Mac Edition is using an older version of the Wineskin engine (WS8 1.3.7)

I thought that was really interesting, and the instructions below are the culmination of hours of trial and error, and going through other how tos for other games and applications.

* First thing you need to do is to actually have a copy of The Witcher for Mac on your computer. Haha.
* Download [Wineskin Winery](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/) from [this link](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads)
* Once downloaded
* Run the app. [This is how it looks like](http://i.imgur.com/167b7.png).
* We need to install an Engine. Click the '+' button under Installed Engines. The [latest version in the drop-down box shows WS8Wine1.5.1](http://i.imgur.com/9EnTY.png), and I would recommend you use that version too. (as an aside, if anyone manages to successfully use WS8Wine1.5.1, let us know in the comments). Press 'Download and Install', and 'OK' [on the next window](http://i.imgur.com/TG28N.png).
* Now we need to install a Wrapper. Back on the main screen, [which of right now is Wineskin-2.5.4](http://i.imgur.com/hdbel.png). It shouldn't matter if you have a different version, we really only need the Engine for The Witcher, but we need a wrapper to create a new wrapper we'll be extracting a file from. But I'm getting ahead of myself. [Press 'OK'](http://i.imgur.com/KA4NS.png).
* After the download successfully completes, and [another window will come up](http://i.imgur.com/67D3g.png) for the option for you to rename the wrapper. It doesn't matter what the name is, we're not using it anyway. Continue, and [wait while your app is being built](http://i.imgur.com/vAStE.png).
* [You may get a prompt asking you to install a Gecko package](http://i.imgur.com/MY2Rb.png). At this point I just pressed 'Install', but just wait it out.
* Once it's complete
* Right click the app you just created, and an app named Wineskin. Take note of that app.
* In a new Finder window
* After you've **BACKED UP** the game
* Run Wineskin.app inside The Witcher. It will show you [a window with four options](http://i.imgur.com/AVHev.png). Choose 'Advanced'.
* In the new window there will be three tabs. [Click the 'Tools' tab](http://i.imgur.com/41gTh.png)
* The next window should show the currently installed engine
* Once it's finished
* Run the game from Steam. Enjoy SIGNIFICANT performance.

There are both Wineskin and Cider wrappers available, so you still need a copy of Skyrim to play it. I'm going to install it later on, and I'll let you know how well it works for me.

UPDATE: The Cider port appears to run flawlessly on a 2011 iMac. It was a pain installing, then move all of the files back over. Also, it wouldn't start for me under the default resolution, so I had to edit the ini file to output native resolution. Some folks in the forum were complaining about fire not showing up properly, but I had no trouble with that. It stuttered for me somewhat on the ""ultra"" settings during fights, but runs smoother on ""high"", and much smoother on ""medium"". Overall, and

About two days later Steam required me to download an updated version of DQ before I could run the game again. And the updated version refused to launch. Checked the forums

Also

I'm not sure if this is just unlucky or if Steam games are constantly assassinating themselves and one another. Does Steam always suck to this degree?

**Updated to add:**

What I've learned: Steam is just a store. They offer convenient access to a good selection of titles but don't set their own compatibility or performance standards for Mac games.

My happy ending: The developer of Defenders Quest has been responsive to feedback in the forums on Steam. I've been sending additional bug reports via email and they've hooked me up with a version of the game that runs without Steam's involvement.

Questions 9-14: General Troubleshooting.

Question 15: Emulators.

Question 16-17: Why NOT to use Mac.

Question 18: I still have a general question

Question 19: Hey

Question 20: Mountain Lion.

Question 21-22: Steam.

Q1. I want to play a Windows game. Should I use Boot Camp, CrossOver, or Cider?

A. If you don't like beta software, CrossOver, and Cider goes. (Hint: Standard, GUI-less Wine can be painful.) **First, check the [AppDB](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;sTitle=Browse%20Applications&amp;sOrderBy=appName&amp;bAscending=true) or [C4](http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/).** If your game is there and listed under Gold or Platinum, great! The page should tell you how to get it running. ([Winetricks info](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Manual+4.5+Advanced+-+Tools)) If not, check www.portingteam.com for a Cider or Wineskin wrapper. You could also try porting it yourself, .NET 3.0+

Q2. What the hell is Wine?

A. Wine stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator. It's an open source (anyone can change it) API layer (change Windows functions to Mac functions). In other words, it may use the Mac OS X function DrawWeirdThing(int). (If that hurts your head, all you really need to know is that Wine can't run malware, Wine is not malware, and I may have explained that incorrectly.)

Q3. What the hell is CrossOver?

A. CrossOver is pre-patched Wine in a consumer-friendly package. Pros over Wineskin: Pre-patched, annoying Winetricks usage.

Q4. What the hell is Cider?

A. Cider is TransGaming's proprietary fork of WineX. (That's a fancy way of saying
Extremely fast

Q5. I have a Hackintosh. Does this sub-reddit still apply to me?

A. Yes. Next question

Q6. I want to use a gamepad

A. Try [this - free](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/) or [this - $8](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gamepad-companion/id428799479?mt=12). If those don't work

Q7. Should I upgrade my hardware? Insert problem here.

A. If, ""purchase a new device"" (Hackintoshes and Mac Pros exempt, obviously), that really depends on how badly you want the game running. You should, while the game is running, check Activity Monitor. If don't have plenty (256MB-ish) of free RAM, upgrade that. (On some of the newer devices, you are screwed

Q8. Should I update my graphics drivers? Insert problem here.

A. (These links are subject to change.) If you are NOT on a Hackintosh OR a Mac Pro, or [NVIDIA - Mac Pros/Hackintoshes](http://www.nvidia.com/object/macosx-270.00.00f06-driver.html) or [ATI - Mac Pros/Hackintoshes](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx).

Q9. So none of that helped. The game is still running slowly

A. QuOFRRS. (Pronounced like, Full-Screen the game, Resolution may need to be lowered, Reboot, System requirements.

Q10. So none of that helped. The game is still running slowly

A. Good God. Contact the developers

Q11. My laptop is getting very hot/screams loudly

A. This may not be a game related issue. This is likely an mds (Spotlight indexer) issue. [How to.](http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/10/disable-or-enable-spotlight-in-mac-os-x-lion/)

Q12. My laptop is getting very hot/screams loudly

A. Depending on the game, Borderlands (Unreal Engine 3/high resources) but not normal for, say, Peggle (casual game). Check Activity Monitor for a process that is using more than 50% CPU that is not the game.

Q13. My laptop stays very hot/screams loudly

A. First, see Q12, and also double-check to see if the game ""actually quit."" (Check the Dock. Is the funny blue light still under the game? For a port, do Wine processes still appear in the Activity Monitor?)

Q14.

Q15. Emulators?

A. Sidebar. If you know of one that isn't listed

Q16. Why Windows over Mac OS X?

A. There are more games

Q17. Why Linux over Mac OS X?

A. The only real reason is better Wine support. (Mac OS X generally has a better *native* game selection than Linux.) There are more users in public forums who can write a Wine patch for Wine running on a Linux system than Wine running on a Mac OS X system. (More choices for audio drivers, Rage runs in Wine on Linux systems, but not in Wine on Mac OS X Systems, as of June 2012.)) 

Q18. What if I need more specific help?

A. Post your problem

Q19. What if I'm a pirate?

A. Whatever. You only really need to follow two general rules: don't help anyone else pirate

Q20. Is Mountain Lion okay?

A. It breaks parts of Wine. Do not update for now if you use any form of Wine. Otherwise

Q21. Steam keeps crashing!

A. [This works.](http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/146dui/i_figured_out_how_to_make_steam_on_mac_run_faster/). And I have no idea why. Just trust it.

Q21. I keep getting disconnected/crashed/unauthorized/logged out/ripped apart by Steam.

1359158514.0,17acyk,Definitive guide to porting Black Mesa Source to Mac,Murmur322,30,8,10,"After much trial and error, no crashes, so be ready for that. Without further ado:

1) Download Wineskin (http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads)
    Download Steam Installer for PC (http://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi)
    Download Black Mesa (http://www.blackmesasource.com/download.html)

2) Open Wineskin Winery click the ""+"".  In the drop down menu select ""WS8WineCXG 10.3.0"". Click ""Download and Install""

3) Highlight ""WS8WineCXG 10.3.0"" and click ""Create New Blank Wrapper"" name it ""Black Mesa"". When the new wrapper is complete click ""View in Finder"" and open it up.

4) In the Black Mesa app click Advanced

5) In Winetricks go into .dlls tab and select ""d3dx9"", also go into the Settings tab and select ""Multisampling = Enabled"". Click Run (5-10min process).

6) Go back to the main menu on your Black Mesa app.  From there click Install Software and select the steam.msi installer.  Once installed log into steam

7) Go into your Black Mesa app and click Advanced again.  Click Install Software and select the Black Mesa installer.

8) After installation launch Steam, about 6GB total to download at this point.

After downloading the SDK's it should be ready to play

9) In your Black Mesa app that you created go into Advanced and make sure that your Windows .EXE window has ""/Program Files/Steam/Steam.exe"" listed as the path.

10) Underneath the Windows .EXE window you should see another window for EXE Flags if you copy and paste within the parentheses (-applaunch 218 -game ""..\..\SourceMods\BMS"") in that window it will bypass opening Steam for the file

Now at this point I ran into some problems that both mac and pc users have reported, but I have found a workaround on that as well.  If you go into the options and click the Black Mesa tab you should find both ""Enable Chromatic Aberration"" and ""Enable Noise Shaders"" are both checked.  Disable both of these options and the black out issues are no more.

There you go

Also get yourself a snazzy icon for your Black Mesa app

In closing I would like to reiterate, and combined a few different methods.  So I would like to thank of course, the Black Mesa team, Skitch and DarkSynergy over at the Black Mesa forum, and especially Tetsu over at the Porting Team forums.  Those are the people who really made this guide.

EDIT 3/18/13: In the past few weeks there has been a problem with Steam updating in Wine, however yesterday I came up with a more permanent solution which is also a pain in the neck, but I thought I would share it nonetheless.  The update loop problem has been fixed in the latest version of Wine (open up Wineskin Winery and update it then go to ""+ New Engine Available"" and download ""WS9Wine 1.5.25"").  This new engine will fix the infinite loop issue, however it will not run Black Mesa properly.  Solution: use both.  I opened up both of my wrappers (Black Mesa and this new 1.5.25 Wrapper), using ctrl-click&gt;Show Package Contents&gt;Drive_c&gt;Program Files.  In Program Files there is a Steam folder, I simply moved that file from Black Mesa Wrapper into the Program Files of the 1.5.25 Wrapper.  Then I ran that wrapper, let Steam update

It works fine now, but I'll update this in the future if need be.  Happy gaming!",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,1363626377.0,,

1330270481.0,q6qrb,iD's RAGE on Mac: beyond expectations,gluskap,30,8,18,"I got back into gaming about a year ago and played the top AAA titles available on the Mac and was a bit letdown: Half-Life 2 and Bioshock were great games but the story was less than I was hyped to expect

And they all looked very nice. But then I played RAGE. Holy crap.

RAGE was savaged by the public: at Metacritic, which was well-deserved because of launch issues like texture pop-in and crashiness. id made it worse by accepting none of the blame and pushing it all on AMD and NVidia drivers. But they pushed out updates and texture pop-in complaints were resolved.

Aspyr published the port for RAGE

Ars Technica gave RAGE the harshest review I'd even seen for a game: ""an airless, Borderlands with the fun stripped out,"" etc. Ben Kuchera also tells a few lies about the game, like ""You go from realizing everyone you love is dead to shooting bad guys in about 30 seconds,"" which is false, and a several other exaggerations and pointless complaints.

He made some good points too, meaning I lost my progress in a level but was kicked back to the beginning of the mission.

My thought: play that awesome mission again? Fine by me! I eventually stopped saving altogether and just relied on the built-in checkpoint system. That meant no saving during missions

There are three utterly amazing things about this game:

1. The combat is top-shelf amazing. All the weapons are fun to use

2. The game is stunning to look at. The game has no detail textures because of the ""megatexture"" tech that id used to build the game, and extremely high geometry modelling of the environments. I was often completely gobsmacked by how intricate, enormous, and beautiful the environments were. Character animations were awesome too.

3. The ""inventory system"" that I normally hate in games was completely painless in RAGE. Crafting items was fun, it didn't slow down the game, it wasn't hard to understand, and I didn't need to look up a wiki to learn it.

I do have some game design complaints:

1. The final mission was the worst in the whole game, but there was none, just endless waves of goons and mutants. Playing the final mission a second time using the mini gun was a total cakewalk. Did they plan to have a big boss, and dropped it during development? Because that's how it feels. The environment is also dull and repetitive. 

2. There are immersion-breaking moments everywhere. For instance, and ""teleport"" you back when it was over, and would ""magically"" give you the money for completing the mission without interacting with someone. Basically, none the main missions functioned like that, so you had to travel to your mission then come back to pick up the reward. It made the side-missions feel extremely tacked on and unpolished. The ""sewer missions"" also felt very tacked on, so if you buy used for 360 or PS3, you aren't missing much

3. I wish the game didn't end after the final mission. I would like to have gone back to the hub towns, and wander the Wasteland for bandits and stranded Authority goons. BTW, there should have been free-roaming mutants in the Wasteland, which otherwise feels too empty and too safe. 

I recommend this game to everyone who likes shooters.

BTW, excellent character animation, post-apocalyptic environment, unusual signature weapon, Authority vs Resistance, long vehicle sections, and really similar weapons load-outs,,False,t3_q6qrb
1310089778.0,ijm48,Two Worlds on OSX,vicegrip,23,2,4,"I saw the game on Steam and was a little leary given the all the criticism I've read.

However

It's also a huge game.

There is some attention to detail that is new. Horseback ridding isn't just aswd and go. Your horse has to turn around. If you push it too hard it gets tired. And you can't take it everywhere.

If you buy it and play mage: get summoning as one of your first spells. Mages are squishy and at first

Yes it's true that the dialog is a little cheesy. But it's all voice acted and

Finally

It's no Oblivion

Honestly

8/10 over all 7/10 for magic 8.5/10 for world and design. Horse back ridding isn't perfect

After playing to the final encounter

Revised score: **magic system 6 (does not rise to its potential).  Game 7. World design 7 (outside world is really nicely done. Dungeon design is lackluster)**

The world was great for the first and second continent. The third and apparently largest continent however has nothing on it to explore instead you visit two little spots and then fight the last boss.

Unfortunately I have to conclude that this game was published before being finished.  That's too bad really

1. Download the latest version of EDuke32 [here](http://www.spam-filter.de/_media/osx/eduke32/eduke32_osx_20110315.dmg)

2. Download the [Hi-Res Pack zip file](http://www.duke4.org/files/nightfright/polymer/polymer_hrp.zip), but recommended). **Leave the folders zipped.**

3. Download the duke3d.grp and duke.rts files. You can obtain them by purchasing a copy of [Duke Nukem 3D on gog.com for $5.99](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/duke_nukem_3d_atomic_edition)

4. In  ""~/Library/Application Support""

5. Within the EDuke32 folder, and place the zip files obtained in step 2 here. Remember to make sure these files are still zipped.

6. Run the game if you haven't already, then save the file.

7. When you start the game again, and under audio, change the sound from 16 bit to 8 bit, then restart the sound system. This should fix any problems with the audio.

8. (Optional) While still in the eduke32.cfg file, then save the file. This causes the game to use the Polymer renderer. While the Polymer renderer will enhance the graphics quite a bit, but may also cause the game to slow down. If you do enable Polymer and are experiencing problems, open the eduke32.cfg file once again, change it back to **Polymer = 0** to disable it, then save the file again.

I contacted Gearbox about the issue and got this in reply:

&gt; Hi

&gt; Thanks for writing in.

&gt; Please contact Aspyr for technical support regarding the Mac version of Borderlands 2.

&gt; You can reach Aspyr support at http://support.aspyr.com/home

&gt; You can also find a list of known issues

&gt; Justin

Then I contacted Aspyr and got basically no help:

&gt; Aspyr Technical Support

&gt; The App Store release of Borderlands 2 (1.3.3) utilizes Game Center and not Steam for co-op multiplayer while the Steam version (1.5.0) utilizes Steam.

If you want help running your favorite Windows-only game on your Mac (without using that virtual machine stuff) shoot me a message (or reply to this topic) with the name of the game and a way to purchase the game online and I'll see if I can help you out. I will make you either a Wineskin wrapper or a Cider wrapper, however.) Remember to check The Porting Team first.

As a warning (thanks to ""badloop"" on reddit for reminding me) that many Wineskin AND cider wrappers do not function well/properly/at all on ATI cards. As a secondary warning

Also

You CAN request a full game download. (Have the game included in the wrapper. A nocd exe WILL be included.) You will be given the download links privately

For a few months now I've been emulating old mac classics and recording demos of them for my [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Mackinstyle?feature=guide). I'm doing this because I know how awesome that hit of nostalgia can be when you see a game from your childhood.  I also know how hard it is to emulate some games smoothly and properly.  I've taken it upon myself to slowly make the biggest collection nostalgic videos of mac games (generally from the 90s)


Please note that I am not AdSensing or trying to make money in any way. It's purely for the love of retro mac gaming!  So won't you please check it out and have a burst of nostalgia today?  I'm also taking requests of what to do next!

*Route 1: Dualshock 3(One: $25-$45

This method is awesome, and will ONLY be playing on Mac OS, this is the controller for you.  From 10.6 and up, the Dualshock 3 will work wirelessly, without any additional software.  You can have anywhere between 1 and 4 controllers connected through bluetooth.  This will NOT be an ideal method if you want to run on Windows, because there is no feasible(or simple) way of making them work wirelessly on Windows.  If you're comfortable with having four controllers plugged in though, be my guest. 


*Route 2: Logitech F710($110 for 4 controllers)*

The new one comes with a wireless dongle

You can purchase used controllers [here](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=261173624627)


*Route 3: XBOX 360 Controllers(Four controllers &amp; Dongle: $100-$155)*

Heres the method I finally decided on using.  It's the most compatible, and will of course work natively with Windows.

Enjoy ;)

**Original**: Hi r/macgaming

What we'll be giving away

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",self,t5_2rk3e,True,,flair2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/nl0qf/running_a_few_game_giveaways_to_celebrate_our/

The only problem I came across (when I was still having problems) was that StarCraft would crash and freeze. I would then have to hard-reboot my notebook. 

I found that if I change my video card settings with gfxCardStatus from the Dedicated NVidea Geforce GT 330m to the integrated Intel only the crashing would stop. 

TL;DR - Using Intel only videocard settings with gfxCardStatus stops Starcraft 1 from crashing.

I know that Macs, but that doesn't mean that they can't still be good enough at it.  But, which ones are, and which ones aren't?  [This page](http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php) has been a big help in comparing basic ""power"" of the chips, but it is way too large, and not mac-specific.

For those shopping for a second-hand Mac, with Mac models and their associated cards being color-coded as ""crap"" (GMA 950, x3100, x1600), ""poor"" (3000, 4000), ""borderline"" (9600M GT, ""Good"" (4870

Yeah, and perhaps even help steer the future of Mac gaming in general.

Thanks for your consideration!  Back to playing SC II on my x1600 MBP.

The game is playing so badly that I was thinking of just biting the bullet and building a little gaming PC, so I don't get what's wrong with me.

I recently bought the Gods &amp; Kings expansion on sale after not having played in a long time, the game started lagging horribly, even on a smallish map. At this point, on the normal map view it will take several seconds to zoom or pan around at all, with a dismal frame rate, probably around 1 FPS. The animations are not at all smooth even when staying in one place. I can at least manage to play somewhat if I stay in the strategic view, but panning around the map is still very choppy that way and it is not a fun way to play at all.

I read that it might be a good idea to restart my computer to clear up some resources

Could I maybe buy Windows 7 for BootCamp and have it run better that way? Could that be a quick fix? Or will I really just need a better computer to run this game okay?

For what it's worth

I used it for years on my 1999 Power Mac G4, so I ended up with a 2010 iMac.   Here there were some compatibility issues, but I eventually found a patch that made it work.    

Then with the release of Lion and one of the updates to 10.6 (I think 10.6.6...) the patch to make RCT3 run on 10.6 stopped working.  
So then I got a 2011 MBP... And can't play it. I try tons of things... No dice.    

Then they rerelease it for steam and the App store in 2012... Now, and they offer to give me a free steam code!

http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver

 I can confirm the controller seems to show up fine in the Systems Preferences, so I know this is working as expected.

 I have written to Aspyr asking for support as they specifically state the game works with the XBOX controller

 Let me know if anyone has some suggestions or ideas. I just can't find a sweet spot for my mouse settings on the game and find it just too spastic for accurate snipin'.

Now I believe I have about 460GB left of free space so some advice on how to partition it would be helpful as well. The games I would get are on Steam.

Essentially if someone can break it down step by step for me just so I have a clear idea of what I need to do and any other recommendations would be appreciated.
