[/r/android's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ifoba/official_transport_tycoon_coming_in_2013_to/)

[PR Text](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/classic-sim-game-transport-tycoon-pulling-in-to-mobile-platforms-this-year-215511701.html)

Choice quotes and my thoughts:

&gt;the original classic is poised to return

&gt;Transport Tycoon for mobile platforms has been designed and directed by legendary game designer Chris Sawyer, and Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 &amp; 2. Veteran developers Origin8 have recreated and restored Sawyer's original simulation code, resulting in the deepest, richest simulation game yet seen on mobile.

&gt;Chris wants TYCOON lovers across the world to enjoy the experience of playing the game on an iPhone

Although they say it will work on iPhone

Remember all the times I said nobody would port RCT to Android because it's in assembly and it's too expensive to port to Android? Well

Jacqui Lyons is/was with Marjcq Ltd.

If I had to guess, it may be a necessity to have less aliasing or whatever. I'm also guessing that Chris is available to answer questions about his original source code, but is not responsible for porting the game. That seems to be Origin8's job.

&gt;In 2010

It seems that the idea behind doing *something* with Transport Tycoon is 3 years old - but the port itself might be younger.

So the only reason this didn't happen sooner is because Chris didn't have the license to Transport Tycoon? That probably includes the game code and everything. This is different from the case with RCT. [To reiterate](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1ez8ex/i_contacted_chris_sawyers_agency_marjacq/):

&gt;Chris Sayer owns all rights including registered trademarks in the name and copyright in content. Atari has an exclusive licence from Chris Sawyer. Atari (and its successors to the licence) are the only people entitled to make new games or approve their development (in accordance with that licence). Marjacq manages Chris Sawyer's rights.

For us to see an RCT mobile port

* Transport Tycoon is successfully ported to mobile
* Chris successfully negotiates a contract for a tablet RCT game

I don't know if Chris is down for the 3.4 million dollars Atari is asking for the game

Before any of you complain that this is only a mobile game

Upon its original release in 1994, years after making the ""Tycoon"" appellation a recognized shorthand for real time empire building games, the original classic is poised to return, painstakingly revised for touch screen devices, and retaining every element of what made the original such a prestigious and enduring piece of entertainment.

Transport Tycoon for mobile platforms has been designed and directed by legendary game designer Chris Sawyer, and Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 &amp; 2. Veteran developers Origin8 have recreated and restored Sawyer's original simulation code, resulting in the deepest, richest simulation game yet seen on mobile.

Praise for the original Transport Tycoon (PC) included:

""Buy it. Classic games like this don't come around often."" 91% - PC Gamer

""A pioneer of the business simulation genre."" - Giant Bomb

Custom stations can do many things for your coaster - 1) increase excitement

So I've compiled a quick guide to creating your own custom station. This is just a beginners' guide - feel free to add on to it to suit your own tastes. And if you have any suggestions



----


[Step One](http://i.imgur.com/aNgFP.png) - here we have a basic station (for the Steel Roller Coaster). 


[Step Two](http://i.imgur.com/bIy5V.png) - The first thing we want to do is lay down a perimeter of walls around our designated footprint. Here


[Step Three](http://i.imgur.com/QeJGy.png) - The next thing you should do is lay down your base - in this case


[Step Four](http://i.imgur.com/GW7Zo.png) - Let's continue the walls around the coaster platform itself


[Step Five](http://i.imgur.com/9cqSQ.png) - Here we've started a basic


[Step Six](http://i.imgur.com/YikG1.png) - To lay the foundation for our continuing roof


[Step Seven](http://i.imgur.com/tkkHc.png) - The top layer of roofing is now up. I staggered the roofline a little bit to make it look more interesting

[Step Eight](http://i.imgur.com/7JGD8.png) - Top it off with a simple roof (I went with the default base block) and you're done!

[Step Nine](http://i.imgur.com/iYN1M.png) - I decided to jazz it up a little bit with another parapet on the highest point of the station.


And that's pretty much it - simple

Finally

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/VzQYy.png)'s a design made up to look like a waterfront factory for a boat ride.

There are three basic classifications to the kind of landscaping you will do, as you only want the land underneath the water to not be completely devoid of detail. Otherwise, no one is going to scrutinize what you've put under the water unless it's for a ride (objects, tunnels, structures, etc.).

&gt;**First school: Mounds**


Why might you want to use this? Break up those huge, you will want to work this in somehow. Even just for a section. It will do wonders. It's also good for big stretches between path that you just want to fill with a small ride or trees. The height variation just makes the expanse a little more interesting when looking at a completed park.

You would start with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/cHDEV.jpg), but this is a reasonable average. You just tweak all the edges, something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y3DJU.jpg). Adjust shape and size according to your needs. Avoid symmetrical shapes, especially when you want a natural look.

This is the simplest way to vary your land, so it works out as a nice middle ground between the next two. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/kvpG5.jpg)'s and example of mounds in practice. Note the slight uphill movement from right to left across the screen.

&gt;**Second school: Levels**


Arguably the most time-consuming, as on mountains, cliffsides, or possibly around rides where you want the terrain to play a role in the theme.

Start with, but with very defined levels. How much you want to flatten each of these is up to both personal preference and just how large you want this landmass to be. Since mine is just an example, it's [not too big](http://i.imgur.com/i8JsR.jpg). From there, de-exaggerate the levels. Textures will play a big roll in this style of landscaping, so bleed your surroundings in carefully. I like to keep the rock sections barren so they stick out, and I feel it makes a more realistic look overall. But you can have foliage bleed over onto rocks - RCT isn't perfect. I tried to make it a little taller overall, but mine is not [very exaggerated](http://i.imgur.com/rRYVv.jpg). The textures make most of the point.

Here's an [in-practice example](http://i.imgur.com/3nKIl.jpg) of this kind of landscaping.

&gt;**Third school: Chaos**


This is a pretty old-school style, and you can get it wrong very, very easily, which will just make it look sloppy. I tend to use this for rocks and dirt to create ""spikes"" of land that will create many different levels in a very small space to keep the foliage you place on top of it looking varied and interesting.

Now, you should never abandon order completely. Maintain levels, and don't transition between them too rapidly. If you want huge height differences, use ""Levels"" up there. If you want to mix (say, chaotic at the bottom and a leveled style rising out of it to create a clearing in the middle/above a heavily forested section) go for it - the styles aren't mutually exclusive. Maintain the idea of levels in a broken-up way. You want different heights in the land without just having a bunch of flat, raise one square, flat, rough, and all four trees on these (and probably surrounding) tiles will be the same height. Avoid too many tiles facing the exact same direction clumped together as well

All that's left is to [texture and cover it](http://i.imgur.com/qhP1g.jpg). I like to use different (but complimentary) land textures on this style of land. It's like an extra dimension to the foliage

So there you have it. Experiment, and what you enjoy creating. I'll be happy to answer any and all questions. It's been a long time since I wrote a guide for anything RCT, and I may be overlooking something.

&gt;**2. Setting up the coaster

I will cover brakes and the different other features that affect them in a later part of this tutorial

When using block brakes

Very few roller coasters have a chain lift directly out of the station. Some notable examples are [Millennium Force](http://i.imgur.com/nmN3e.jpg) at Cedar Point and [Viper](http://i.imgur.com/3heKp.jpg) at Six Flags Magic Mountain; however

[Here's Nitro again

Examples are less important here. Just build your station 2~5 units off the ground and construct some kind of pre-lift section. It can be a drop, or simply an s-bend, or any combination thereof.

&gt;**2.1 Lifts**

I've looked through a lot of rides, however, do not. See [Timberhawk](http://i.imgur.com/wW1UJ.jpg) and [Mean Streak](http://i.imgur.com/gjlvt.jpg). Bare this in mind.

Keep your lifts realistic. That means not only straight (unless, in which case use [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZHZRV.jpg) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/BZC9T.jpg) inclined method, depending on the length of your trains), but of reasonable height. Any woodie over 170ft is pushing it, especially considering the taller your lift hill becomes, the less realistic RCT's method of handling steep drops becomes.

Another thing to keep in mind is lift speeds; have a reason for what you set. Do not just leave it at 5mph because you are lazy. The taller a lift hill

&gt;**2.2 Cable lift hills**

Cable lift hills are rare but, yet they are only possible on Intamin incline track. You cannot have a pre-lift of any kind (including brakes) when using a cable lift hill. Now, I see people make steep lift hills when they use cable lifts quite often. I encourage you to look at the shaping of any lift hill, cable-powered or not, and reconsider doing so unless you have a strong reason for doing so. ""It looks cool"" doesn't count.

To create a cable lift hill, [the cable track will fill itself in](http://i.imgur.com/pVHtl.jpg).

&gt;**2.3 Launches**

Very common, so to achieve higher speeds you will need a longer launch track. Also note that crossing the lift track will play the lift sound unless you merge to another track type and have the chain lift there. I'll explain merging in a later part of this tutorial. To adjust lift speed, simply open the Rides -&gt; Edit Ride Stats dialog box, scroll down to your ride, enter the desired lift speed, and hit Apply or OK.

Familiarize yourself with how launch tracks are employed in real life.

- [Xcelerator](http://i.imgur.com/QcqNF.jpg)

If you wish for a launched train to return to the station backwards on a track with a hacked lift launch

Whether you ""stage"" before your launch is up to you. This would include a full or near-full stop on a brake run before launching (outside the station). Some rides, but I understand that it is not the most common way to handle a launch.

I ask because it seems people are split on the issue

I'm torn, RCT3 really became a much better product and in many ways more realistic.  Plus there are good things there, like the peep differentiation and grouping and of course being able to explore your creations from a 1st-person level--and permanent zero-clearances.  You also have to think 3D is the new standard.

It was the first real computer game I played (I think I played like Frogger and a few other dumb games).  It was super challenging at first... I remember for a while I would borrow as much money as I could just to make Mischief

Then I realized the money aspect of the game, the first thing I did was install roller coaster tycoon.

When I was playing the game as a kid, like avoiding food courts, and making the perfect length queue lines, and where to place rides in the park.

I've noticed now, but I never enjoyed it nearly as much.  Even after downloading the original rct scenarios, part of the joy was beating one so you could unlock another.  This aspect was gone in rct2 and made it much less rewarding to finish a scenario.

I never ever messed around with scenery.  I would put down a few things if I could

It just seems like a very different play style.  Most people who post here aren't bragging about what their final park value was upon completing a scenario

I think it's really cool.  It's just different.  But I don't think I could ever play the game like that.  I reinstalled rct2 recently and I can't stand it.  It's too.... easy.  The challenge is still there, as I imagine many of you do.

This is so long and I'm sorry for making you read it all if you didnt like it. But these are just my thoughts that I felt like throwing out there.

As I understand it:

* Atari owns the rights to the name ""RollerCoaster Tycoon"". If a new game were to be made

* Chris Sawyer owns the graphics

* Marjacq manages the games on behalf of Chris Sawyer.

Is this accurate?

---

I got this in response:

&gt;No. Chris Sayer owns *all* rights including registered trademarks in the name and copyright in content. Atari has an exclusive licence from Chris Sawyer. Atari (and its successors to the licence) are the only people entitled to make new games or approve their development (in accordance with that licence). Marjacq manages Chris Sawyer's rights.

---

What does this mean?

* Chris Sawyer owns the games RCT1 and RCT2.

* Chris Sawyer owns the name RollerCoaster Tycoon (the trademark)

* Atari licenses the trademark for ""RollerCoaster Tycoon"" from Chris Sawyer.

* The **only** company licensed to sell the games RCT1, only Atari can sell RCT1, RCT2, or RCT3.

---

My speculation:

* Atari holds an exclusive license to sell RCT1, you would have to talk to Atari. The contract doesn't allow for any other company to make RCT games.

* Atari / Frontier Developments owns the copyright to the game code

* The auction (starting bid $3.5 million) will be for the rights to this contract. Thus

 * License the games to GOG, etc.
 * Create new games in the RCT franchise (maybe with a fee to Chris Sawyer for each new game?)

* Chris Sawyer may want to buy back the rights for his game. He could probably afford it.",,t5_2rzsl,False,etc,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1ez8ex/i_contacted_chris_sawyers_agency_marjacq/

But back to the topic. I usually make the exit a bit of a longer path with a ""no entry"" sign at the end of it to keep people from wandering back up the exit area.  I then stick a balloon stall right at the exit and change the color to match the coaster.  I find it nice to be able to see people wandering my parks with different colored balloons that they can only get by going on a certain coaster.

Note: I deliberately left out RCT2-only track elements so users of both games can take advantage of this guide. Banked curving drops add to excitement

------

This is a guide to creating an exciting roller coaster - the main goal of the game. This post *only* covers the basics; feel free to add on to this guide in the comments below.

------

Step One - [Here](http://i.imgur.com/0jfCU.png) we have a basic Steel Roller Coaster platform. Make the platform as long as you can (if you're using RCT1) - the added capacity is worth the extra space.

Step Two - [Bigger isn't always better!](http://i.imgur.com/MA2J5.png) If you build too tall

Step Three - [A curving drop](http://i.imgur.com/k9Q7B.png) is generally more exciting than a straight one.

Step Four - [Inversions](http://i.imgur.com/SsC6V.png) add to your excitement rating

Step Five - Guests love [airtime](http://i.imgur.com/kEsxF.png)

Step Six - [Twisty bits](http://i.imgur.com/o1HLl.png) add to excitement but also adds to your nausea rating

Step Seven - [Helices](http://i.imgur.com/ldjgb.png) can be valuable, but your positive G rating as well. Unlike negative G, it's advisable to always aim for a lower positive G rating.

Uh-oh. Those curves at the tail end of the helix do not look good. As a general rule

Step Eight - A [wider radius curve](http://i.imgur.com/55Gvu.png) will bring down the positive G rating

Step Nine - An [on-ride photo section](http://i.imgur.com/pBt1I.png) boosts excitement

Step Ten - It's time to start returning to the station. [Wide curves!](http://i.imgur.com/IugaP.png)

Step Eleven - Don't forget [the brakes](http://i.imgur.com/lAwgU.png). In RCT1, this becomes a smaller problem.

Step Twelve - Place [the entrance](http://i.imgur.com/MNdVg.png) about midway between the train about to be loaded. This cuts down on loading time and increases efficiency.



It's pretty much done - [let's test](http://i.imgur.com/sXU1a.png) and see how it works!

[The stats:](http://i.imgur.com/Jtvev.png) 5.69 excitement (high)

Very respectable for a roller coaster that (literally) took five minutes to finish! Also, the excitement should be higher than the intensity, which should be higher than nausea (E&gt;I&gt;N). 

But we're not finished - there are several ways in which we can crank up the excitement just a little bit. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/sLQiD.png)

Now, and interaction with more scenery can all help boost the excitement rating.

-----

For those who prefer to do things themselves, or for the merely curious, here's a little step-by-step **(you don't have to do any of this crap if you download the above file)**:

1. You will need a hex editor
2. The sound effects are in {RCT installation dir}/Data/css1.dat. Make a backup copy of this file
3. Read over [this page describing the format of css1.dat](http://www.strategyplanet.com/rctuk/tid/css1dat.html). It's actually for RCT1
4. On the list in the above page, so we want the 37th dword in the OffsetList. This is located at offset 4 * 37 = 148 in the file.
5. The 4 bytes starting at byte 148 (or whatever you calculated for your least favourite sound) give the offset to the actual sound data. For the toilet
6. The 4 bytes starting at the offset you found in step 5 contain the length of the sound data for the particular effect you want to kill. Before you change anything, you should see ""01 00 01 00 22 56 00 00 44 AC 00 00 02 00 10 00"".
7. If you're good and confident that you've found the right place, and not load anything. Ah, the sweet sound of silence!

Start with a rapids ride with two stations: Station 1 below ground, so be sure to adjust that accordingly. Also make sure that Station 1's loop has at least 1 straight flat piece. 

[Step 2:](http://i.imgur.com/oQHOpUd.png)
build the station of the type of guide track that you want leading up to a straight piece in the Station 1 loop, and start a climb to the surface. Now you can build the rapids track back where it was after applying ZC. The overlapping straight piece will cause the boats to change track, and in order to do that, the rapids track has to be built last.

Build your station. Most Rapids stations are round, by using 2 3x3 turns followed by a 2 unit station. The 3x3 turns allow you to fit the 2x2 and 4x4 wooden platforms around the track. You **do not** need to add entrances and exits to the guide track. Keep in mind during this step that the boats will be 5ft/1.5m/1u above ground level, which will be where water will be raised to later.

[Step 4:](http://i.imgur.com/LDs0ZXc.png) 
Build almost all of the circuit for the guide track. The longer this is

[Step 5:](http://i.imgur.com/BWiQvxd.png)
Open the rapids ride. The boats will leave the station like normal, they will switch directions and go along the guide track. [You can mend the gap as soon as every boat has passed by any part you'd be constructing on.](http://i.imgur.com/6G57PMS.png)

[Step 6:](http://i.imgur.com/yReqStc.png)
Make it look pretty. Add waterfalls, and add foliage and other decorations to add to the scene (not pictured).

Ask questions or let me know if I missed anything or said anything ambiguous. Hope this helps!

&gt;**The Palette**


Either before you even touch a section, rides, landscaping, themes, and play it all back tenfold. Palm trees should not cover ski resorts, and magnolia trees should never be used anywhere ever. Ever.

... Okay, and an absolute maximum of seven, to prevent it looking too repetitive or too messy. Ideally you should add one quarter-tile tree to vary the size just a little more - what you choose should depend on the others, and you shouldn't start placing it until the full tile trees are placed and you're good with their positions, for reasons I'll explain later.

Here are some examples of palettes I threw together:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/uztDQ.jpg)

- [2](http://i.imgur.com/3i7t8.jpg)

- [3](http://i.imgur.com/dJEQa.jpg)

- [4](http://i.imgur.com/GVwXW.jpg)

- [5](http://i.imgur.com/esVS8.jpg)

- [6](http://i.imgur.com/5FslW.jpg)

- [7](http://i.imgur.com/cGuhb.jpg)

Note how even the ground texture plays a role in the feel of the foliage, I use what I like, and palettes that work for you will probably include trees I didn't use at all. What's important to keep in mind is the colors. You must strike a balance between randomness and monotone in color, where you vary it just enough to make it interesting, but keep a set, predominant shade to give the overall look cohesiveness. Further accents can come from flowers, although I generally use those to carry colored details from buildings across forested areas, but it's just a guess-and-check game to see what works

&gt;**Sizes**


You can break down the trees into one of three subsets: short, right?). It's important to include trees from at least two of these groups for the same reason you don't want too much of one color. Varied land heights beneath the trees will help break up the skyline, but especially for short trees, landscaping is not very easily hidden and thus creating a natural look becomes a problem. Aim for 1-3-1 or 2-3-1 or something similar (for short - average - tall) for a good, solid approach. The more you master the concept, the more you can break the ""rules"" and experiment.

[This is a small handful of trees from the base set](http://i.imgur.com/dvodF.jpg). You can see just how big the height differential can be, so it's not like you have to say ""Okay. I have a tall Cedar of Lebanon and a short Palm Tree. Now I have to make them work"". Focus on colors first. Sometimes even the [color of surrounding rides can fill in for those](http://i.imgur.com/NNJtm.jpg) you're leaving out of the palette for contextual reasons.

&gt;**Underbrush**


This is where you hammer the point home. It also is least important to ""get right"", it should be dense, but in amusement parks, usually you will have small patches of trees interspersed amongst the rides, shops, and path. The underbrush beneath them should creep out and cover the ground around in a feathering effect. Which objects you pick for your underbrush are almost entirely personal preference. You have the seven shrubs/bushes from the base set, the six from the jungle set, I'm talking about the three semi-natural-looking quarter-tile tree objects at the top of the window). Pick three to five

This is why you should want until this point to place any quarter-tile trees - when in zero-clearance mode, but it can look bad, and you might as well do everything you can to maximize the attractiveness of what you're creating. [You should get a nice, full look](http://i.imgur.com/6aUcy.jpg) for areas where foliage should look thick. [In more sparse areas, more sparse underbrush is appropriate](http://i.imgur.com/IMWjd.jpg). [Sometimes it's best to just emulate the colors of the trees](http://i.imgur.com/IXSVE.jpg). It's all up to you. Take care also to not carelessly place shrubs under ride supports. The supports, especially on wooden coasters, can draw attention to itself and look sloppy. Again

&gt;**CSO Foliage**


The thing about most CSO benches nowadays is they have a custom set of trees created to save space in the ""small objects"" tab, as you can have nearly any shade with nearly any kind of tree. Certain colors will look better with certain kinds of trees, but modifying the [color of the trunks](http://i.imgur.com/gLzlH.jpg) specifically can help darken or lighten an overall color scheme. Sometimes [the changes are subtle and confined to just one or two types of tree](http://i.imgur.com/lfRyB.jpg). It's up to you. Take the same basic principles of size, color, and whatnot, and add the dimension of custom color. [Even the bushes and smaller stuff can be colorable](http://i.imgur.com/yjOLo.jpg), which means you can repeat the same object more times without it looking like crap.

&gt;**3. Heights**

The pacing of a ride is EXTREMELY important, alternating between exciting and relaxing parts (relative of course). A good pre-lift plays into this quite easily, hopefully showing off the scenery while moving just a bit faster than the journey up the lift hill will be. There are technical reasons for these pre-lifts (such as how disengaging from the station works), but RCT doesn't care about them.

It's important to note that good pacing does **NOT** result from a bunch of chain lifts and brakes. That is a cheap way of controlling speed, and it is boring to watch. Good pacing is achieved through managing element heights properly. Gravity and friction is all you need. If you want to build something like [Beast](http://i.imgur.com/H8KMZ.jpg), go for it - just understand *why* Beast is the way it is, and make it have a purpose. Also, keep it rare. If everyone tries to do the ""exceptions"" to the rules, it really ruins it.

Usually a good rule to go by is the unofficial law of fours - on average, it's a good idea to make the first hills following the lift or launch 6~8 units (30~40ft) lower than the lift itself, shortening the gap to about per as you approach the MCBR (or just halfway through the ride, if you don't have an MCBR), and continuing down as the ride ends, where you can usually have several hills of very similar height to finish the ride off.

&gt;**3.1 Air time**

Air time plays a large role in the pacing of your design. Carefully balancing speed and the shape of your hills to produce ideal negative vertical G-forces is huge. On coaster styles with the large steep-to-level piece

It's worth noting that, with the same number of steep hill segments - [like so](http://i.imgur.com/mYRDD.jpg).

If you're going to mix the two methods on the same whole, the spike in forces you are creating makes no sense to have, as it is so avoidable.

&gt;**3.2 MCBRs**

MCBR stands for Mid-Course Brake Run

The longer your ride is

Your MCBR should be about the length of a train. If a train has to stop here, or in the middle of an inversion. Including a catwalk and steps is something you should consider, but how you execute it is something you have to experiment with on your own (probably with CSO - NCSO RCT2 does not really have anything that works, and in RCTLL this is generally accomplished with trackitecture). Note that the block brake will try to slow the train to 4mph. You can circumvent this by having a train approach above a certain speed, [and having no (acting) brakes before it](http://i.imgur.com/vqrev.jpg). The train will slow, but not as much. That said, your train **MUST** still be able to clear the latter half of the track from 4mph

You can also have an MCBR that is not a block brake, it can act as speed control. A stretch of 22mph brakes acting on a train entering a 30+ is just enough to make sure shorter elements of the latter half of the ride are not taken at too high of speeds. Guests will speed up the trains, and the further into the course the train gets, the greater the disparity between tested and actual speeds/forces becomes.

&gt;**3.3 Order of elements and inversions**

How you manage your major inversions affects speed just as much as how you manage your hills. Again

- [Scream!](http://i.imgur.com/QsyGt.jpg)

- [Great American Scream Machine](http://i.imgur.com/DCqNp.jpg)

- [Batman: The Ride](http://i.imgur.com/cvlTw.jpg)

- [Nemesis](http://i.imgur.com/1yxob.jpg)

- [Stormrunner](http://i.imgur.com/fn1WX.jpg)

On rides with elements like large loops and vertical track + quarter loops, however, you should note that this will create four equal-height inversions. So unless you want that first loop to be way too forceful, or the cobra roll far too slow, you've got to make some modifications. If the starting height of the cobra roll is 0ft (6 units), the top would be 85ft (22 units), so we'll use that as our ""minimum"". The previous elements should be higher.

So we want our dive loop to be 95~100ft (24~25 units)

Dive loops/immlemans can be accomplished one of three ways (only two in RCTLL):

- [Vertical track](http://i.imgur.com/SBBpi.jpg)

- [Steep track + barrel roll](http://i.imgur.com/GJdhR.jpg)

- [Steep track + corkscrew](http://i.imgur.com/A0zei.jpg)

*Note: Creating the vertical twist version of the dive loop or immleman is much higher than the other two

The shaping of your elements does matter. The realistic reasons for this are complex, buildings, or other rides. But try to give the roller coaster precedence.

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard have done just about every element in the book somewhere (with notable exceptions such as the Norwegian Loop, and what we as designers should try to emulate.

- [Cobra roll](http://i.imgur.com/QSATv.jpg): Almost always V-shaped. In RCT this is accomplished via two mirrored large half-loops linked by two half-cokscrews, be flexed a little to accommodate something else.

- [Immleman/Dive loop](http://i.imgur.com/f5zfp.jpg): Same element, resulting in a practically nonexistent footprint. But you can see the roll never *quite* hits 180° upside-down. You will see this everywhere, even on inverts and other coaster manufacturers' rides. You accomplish this look in RCT with the barrel roll or corkscrew (see previous examples) rotating the same direction as the large half-loop. Right-twisting barrel roll = right large half-loop. Left-twisting corkscrew = left large half-loop. It's small effort for good visual payoff.

- [Corkscrews and barrel rolls/zero-G rolls](http://i.imgur.com/JDjKr.jpg): We don't have much control over our rolls, a corkscrew has doubled back on itself in a real design (see [Drachen Fire](http://i.imgur.com/2OB1m.jpg), now sadly defunct), but again, this is one of those you want to have a VERY good reason for so it does not become overused.

As a final note, it makes no sense to put something so forceful at a point where the train would be moving its fastest. This includes immediately following larger inversions like loops and even corkscrews. It goes back to the height of hills - treat barrel rolls as a part of hill crests, and plan the speed around them accordingly.

I decided to make my own scenario for this, just enough money to have a natural growth in your park, which makes it more enjoyable in my experience. Research is set up so you get the bigger rollercoaster rides later on, meaning your park can have more natural progression.

--------------

**Note:** this is a *very basic* guide to building a roller coaster for the purpose of beating a scenario. If you're looking for a building guide covering the more advanced options -- including hacking

Let's get started!

-----------------------

1. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/5UUDUuo.jpg) we have a basic twister roller coaster. It's very versatile and easy to build, it's advisable to build long stations. For our coaster, though, the train packs a lot of capacity into a smaller size thanks to its four-across seating, so we'll be fine with a smaller one.

2. [Generally speaking

3. [A curving drop](http://i.imgur.com/N8bHp3s.jpg) gets higher excitement ratings than a straight drop

4. [Some roller coasters](http://i.imgur.com/L0GnaoN.jpg) have a special element (that you can access from the drop-down menu) which gives you a wider-radius pull-out. It's very helpful in this situation

5. [Loops are fun

6. [We'll need to burn some speed](http://i.imgur.com/LJkK3Ua.jpg) before we can use the smaller loops

7. [Burning some more speed.](http://i.imgur.com/BHUV9uu.jpg) Remember to bank the curves

8. [Now we can go wild!](http://i.imgur.com/BrLUDk7.jpg) The twister coaster comes with a veritable laundry list of special elements. Feel free to experiment, the key. Too much elements in too small a space, or taken at a too-high speed, will result in a very intense and nauseating coaster. 

9. [Block brakes, the block brakes spring into action, holding the next train safely at the brakes to prevent a collision. In Roller Coaster Tycoon, you can disable block brakes by going into a roller coaster's settings tab. If you choose to do so, the length of the station will dictate how many trains can run on the circuit at one time.

 Important: the remainder of the circuit following the block brakes *must not go above the height of the brakes!* Since trains can potentially come to a full halt

10. [Following the blocks, more demanding elements. 

11. [A helix](http://i.imgur.com/AftCDW3.jpg) adds ride duration, since high speeds can be absolute killer for helices (and turns in general).

 Sorry

12. [An on-ride photo section and a bunny hill](http://i.imgur.com/GoPZFws.jpg) also contribute to our excitement rating

13. [A set of blocks right before the station](http://i.imgur.com/PsAPuU8.jpg) is a good idea

14. [Let's test](http://i.imgur.com/rwSGJjB.jpg) and see if it works! Note the train sitting on the block brake in the corner

15. [The ratings](http://i.imgur.com/2XR7Rn6.jpg) -- not bad! Ideally

 We're not done

16. [And here's how!](http://i.imgur.com/fws5A8X.jpg) Trees, and custom architecture surround your coaster can boost your E rating by a few points. 

 Give your coaster a wicked cool name and a coat of paint

""Catalyst"" is a coaster that occupies the entire sandbox. It's post-apocalyptic themed and zigzags through city ruins, especially with the post-production towards the end. I used several support and ride add-on packs that were found on the late [vodhin.org](http://www.vodhin.org) website.

""Snow Queen"" takes place at a secret military cosmonaut-training base in Siberia, though it's not as nice as Catalyst. I used some of the custom fireworks from the vPyro Pack 12, as well as some of the built-in ones that I had modified myself. I also made all the lasers.

When you go fast you get pushed back into the seat, is not taken into account in RCT and is the affect of acceleration (for an example look at kingda ka)). Lateral Gs are from fast corners or any spec. elements that involve turns like corkscrews. Vertical Gs are from peaks

Lateral Gs are the harshest kind, and tight turns. Make your turns banked in almost every situation, make them fast enough to generate some Gs but not too fast, and make them wide. Never do radius 2 turns unless it's right before or after a lift or under 15 mph. Likewise, always do banked diagonal turns with spacing above 60 mph. Spacing: putting a straight piece in between wide diagonal turns.

Vertical Gs are misunderstood. You absolutely want negative Gs as they make you float. The best coasters in the world have extended periods of ""airtime"" and airtime is what gives most* coasters excitement. Negative Gs are generated at peaks

Here's some examples:

* For one, the palms have these screeching neon green tones to them, and all and all the sprite is less complex than the standard palm's sprite, despite it being bigger.

* Everything looks like it was made out of plastic. The first picture was a good example of this, while the standard cactus is very subtle with its colors and blends well with whatever's around it.

* A lot of the stuff is HUGE. Take [these similar statues](http://i.imgur.com/CnYTP.png) for example. The regular horseback rider is only slightly taller than the guests sprites

* Another issue is some of the scenery just doesn't have any versatility. Take [these craters](http://i.imgur.com/3btajh.png) as an example. With the one on the left (found in the martian themeing group), all you can do with it is use it as a set piece. In all respects it's just like a great big useless rock that really doesnt look good with anything around it.

I suppose this is just me offering up my take on why the scenarios in RCT2 don't work very well. Of course there's the poor park design in some, but with most of the maps it just seems that Simon Foster either gave up or the spritework got put in the hands of someone else.

I was blown away by it. I played the demo scenarios (Forest Frontiers, so I stayed up until midnight just to install it and get a glimpse of all the new content not in the demo.

Yeah, but I still got in a few hours here and there. Not to toot my own horn, but I became fucking good at it. I mean, I knew how to build coasters just right the first time, with only a minor edit here and there. Beating even the difficult scenarios became easy... so I went looking for more.

I was pretty active on a lot of RCT sites back in the day

RCT2 was much the same. Although it lacked some of the appeal of the first game (I liked the restriction - helped me innovate)

**Overview:** Reddit Land is a community project for /r/rct for members to collaborate and build a theme park together. This project will be administered by myself and Valdair. For the project we will be splitting the participants into two groups, the other half to the other, and Valdair and I will moderate and distribute one map each. Each participant will receive a turn to edit their own plot of land, after which we will distribute it to the next person. Once everyone receives a turn, we can send the map back to any participant who requests further edits, and once all is done we will release the final maps.

**Project Rules:**

* Each participant will be in ownership of the map for five days, they must private message the save game file back to the moderator.

* The save game file will be distributed via private message. Once your turn arrives you will receive a message from myself or Valdair (depending on what group you are assigned to) containing a link to download the save game file over [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/). To install you simply paste the file into your saved games folder for RCT2 (typically it's a variation of C://Program Files &gt; Atari &gt; Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 &gt; Saved Games). The file should be available under the 'load saved game' menu option in the game. For turning in your completed section

* **If the player fails to message the save file back to the moderator within 24 hours after their deadline passing

* If a player runs out of time to edit their property

* Trainers are not required but are allowed.

* Custom scenery imports, ride types, etc) are forbidden.

**In-game Rules:**

* This project will take place in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.

* Each player is assigned a plot of land that is in their control. The land plots are divided from each other by a river system

* Players are free to choose to develop and build on their land however they see fit

* Players are not allowed to construct, or tamper with any other participant's land, rides, scenery, etc. Players are not allowed to edit the land in a way that would heavily alter the rivers dividing the park. Players may not delete the pre-made bridges or create new bridges linking two different land plots. Any violation is subject to disqualification for the offending player.

* Players are allowed to build over the rivers dividing their land from others

* The park as a whole is to remain CLOSED for the duration of the project. Opening the park to guests during player editing is not allowed. Only at the end of all construction from every participant will the park be opened and put up for public sharing. This rule is to allow the park to be play-tested after construction is done. If the park is open while someone is working on it, everyone can build without taking care of other player's land.

* All staff must have assigned patrol areas. There will be no free-roaming staff members in the park. General rule of thumb for mechanics is one mechanic per two/three rides
The player should provide sufficient facilities (food/drink stalls

* Duplicate ride types are allowed

* Above all,False,,t5_2rzsl,1343275081.0,,,t3_x658a

Some ideas on how we can do this:

* We take a big empty sandbox park and divide it up into chunks

* We make a list of who would do what; create a run-down of which order everyone's contributions will be added

This would take a heck-of-a lot of coordination between us in order to keep the park up to date and make sure we aren't editing stuff at the same time

This is just an idea I had. Any of you guys have feelings over it? Whether or not it can be done? How would we go about doing it? Should we do it?

**Edit**: Well it seems like we do have interest in this idea

* **Will this project take place in it's own subreddit?** Updates on this project could potentially spam RCT's main sub so should we keep this off in it's own sub so as everything is easy to find and organize between us?

* **How will the park be divided among us?** Will the land be cut into regular grids or would each section be sort of 'freeform'; the barriers being the natural landscape around them such as canyons, etc. Also how would plots be distributed among participants; would it be given out randomly, would it be first-come-first-serve, or would the map be pre-made to cater to different players' requests (for me I love building out-and-back style coasters so I'd prefer a lengthy but narrow plot versus a generally round/square-shaped plot).

* **How will this be moderated?** Because of how saved files work in RCT

* **What would the rules be?** Do players have to stick precisely to their defined land

This is what I can think of right now. Feel free to bring up any other major points I missed. The more organized we get this the better and more awesome our creation will be.

Hey guys

So I got the park benches done earlier than I expected, feel free to explore the bench for the park you're on. Those starting each park, you're free to start working now!

---

**Rules**

* Parks for Loopy Landscapes and RCT2 should change hands via PM or private subreddits. When you are finished

* RCT3 parks should change hands in whatever way the group decides on (I recommend google drive). You must notify everyone in your team, or as complex as the full park file. Periodically, I'll ask for a backup copy from whoever is working on the park. I expect you to comply.

* From this point on, because I won't. Work with what you have available. 

* That said

* I've made a ""Redditland"" flair for everyone to use as a spoiler tag. You're free to post any content from these parks that you want

* Respect other people's land and creations. Don't delete anything you didn't make. Don't build where you aren't designated, though.

* Trading land is allowed, trading land will not change your spot in the schedule.

* Merging territories is also allowed

* You **MUST** submit the park to the next user on time. If you're even a day late, feel free to update me more frequently than required, so the next person in line can have something from you.

I'll be keeping backups of all the parks. I'll be keeping the original bench

I think that's it here. Let me know if I'm missing anything.

---

**Tips**

Download the benches now. Get familiar with what each bench includes and omits. Know the land that you have to work with. Start planning what you want to do.

Saving track designs and structures is a good way to maximize your limited time with each park.

Communicate frequently with your teammates. If you want to, you shouldn't hesitate to ask. I've even had someone ask me if he and another player could be paired together so that they could do this.

Some of you have created private subreddits. That's a great idea. Keep up with it

EDIT: so basically from what I gathered is focus on excitement and keep intensity down. Does adding scenery and such help with any of this?",,t5_2rzsl,1373219141.0,two,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1ht3k8/help_a_noob_out/

&gt;**Concept**

So, there's a way around that. Any of you who opened Castello dal Mare and watched Velocità di Volo might have noticed this. It's quite a simple process, and it's the gateway to a lot of cool stuff that can be done in RCTLL and RCT2, so I think you guys should know. Disclaimer: You're gonna need 8cars. You guys having issues with Wine... well, I think you're SOL. Another disclaimer: it is a VERY VERY VERY GOOD IDEA to save before you start this, because even if you do everything right there's still a chance the game gets angry and error traps you. No one likes being access violated, and if you save before doing anything risky it's not going to piss you off and cost you a keyboard/monitor.

&gt;**Tools**

I prefer 8cars v1.302 for this

&gt;**The Process**

We're going to use an example track, so long as it isn't the default) before you start to make them easier to find in 8cars. The pieces being merged must be PRECISELY the same piece, facing the same direction. If you merge backwards pieces, you're going to get an error trapper when a train travels over it.

So starting with the simplest of things, the reverse happens. This holds true for any number of merges. The track the train is on must be merged on top of the track it is going to (you can merge any number of times, although the more variables you introduce the more likely you are to error trap yourself - error trappers make the dancing panda sad).

Once you have that built, and [I've made them both white so they stand out](http://i.imgur.com/aJeiT.jpg). You can color them however you wish, just make sure the pieces are painted.

Now you tab out to 8cars per Trainer, and [do all these things](http://i.imgur.com/hrf1x.jpg). Raise/Lower must be checked, and you must select the alternative color scheme you used on the track to be merged. In addition, the height of the track is important. In RCT2, 1 unit = 5ft, so keep that in mind. Since each track was only 10ft over the other, we use -2 for both - hit OK or Apply and it should lower. The operating mode I will go over in a bit. [You need to do basically the same thing for the other track](http://i.imgur.com/8xXTH.jpg), make sure to check that a) it is painted properly

If you test the ride, merging does not give any kind of boost or detriment, it counts the path of the train all the same.

&gt;**A More Complex Example**

Good design rarely, so how to do this stuff on a real layout? Well, let's say you want to get the wide steep-to-flat pieces on an Arrow looping style track (corkscrew coaster) - normally this is impossible, but with some simple trickery it's extremely easy. [Here's an example I've set up](http://i.imgur.com/5KKge.jpg) - note the height differences due to the clearances of the respective track pieces. -2 will not work in this case, and you have to look at the actual height difference. 105 - 75 = 30ft, which means 6 units. 100 - 85 = 15ft, which means 3 units. Heading back to the 8cars Rides Menu, just with -3 for raise/lower. I circled the operating mode here again for an important reason. If you leave the ride on Continuous Circuit mode, however, back in game we see [our train crosses the element with ease](http://i.imgur.com/pIgVL.jpg).

&gt;**Another Thing**

Another cool thing this raising/lowering business lets us do is realistic catwalks. [Construct an Arrow 4D (multidimensional) coaster lift over your ride's](http://i.imgur.com/FmFUJ.jpg), [except with ""Main"" selected as the color scheme, and the height modification applied](http://i.imgur.com/IvlZj.jpg). Back in game, [this is what we get](http://i.imgur.com/3o9rw.jpg).

This will work with just about any track to any other track - HOWEVER, the trains look a little funny going through the element, worst case you error trap yourself. However, cars like the corkscrew trains can go through B&amp;M/steel twister large elements with no issue, and they can go vertical as well. The same goes for flying trains (both types). Exercise caution, but don't be afraid to experiment. Also, I strongly advise against merging on diagonals, perhaps) can error trap you.

&gt;**Reverse Merging**

Note that, the train will either crash, or you'll get an error trapper (probably the former - I know from experience &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ).

I wanted to use a really simple example for this, no operating mode changes need to be made, you just have to lower the tracks. Back in game we see [the train traverses both directions no problem](http://i.imgur.com/ZgPMX.jpg). Note that the order of track is CRITICAL. Doing the opposite of this will result in your train crashing.",Multi,False,,t5_2rzsl,mul,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/ulnql/valdairs_guide_to_stuff_mini_installment_merging/

One of the most handy scenery items in my book is [this angled support](http://i.imgur.com/1mgif.png). using this with your coasters, these pieces can also be used quite well on steel coasters too, particularly the more 'height and speed' focused rides like [giga coasters](http://i.imgur.com/NaOS7h.png).

One ride that I built that I think these support structures really pull off well on is [this out-and-back woodie, yes I named it after that bridge). If you look at the coaster [without the scenery added on](http://i.imgur.com/CLP8ch.png), it looks very drab and the taller sections look really off being that the supports are just straight up and down. However [once you put on some of those angled supports](http://i.imgur.com/MHlkwh.png), it looks much more appealing. Also one thing that I like to do is run tracks underneath these supports, as with the block brakes section in the picture prior. Sometimes you can get these odd angles from these supports, and here I like to add on little structures, such as [this maintenance/lookout shed](http://i.imgur.com/Burj0h.png).

Now, but in the opposite direction. The swan boat piece of track needs to be built after the splash boats piece. 

Use Edit Ride Stats to change the operating mode of the swan boats to Continuous circuit mode. Open the swan boat ride. Wait for the swans to merge onto the other track. you'll be able to see how the swans go through the track instead of on top of it. We fix this by making the top layer of track invisible by changing the track type using Edit Ride Stats to Crooked house. It should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/TsOjp0t.png) now. If you want to get rid of the now unneeded swan boat track, I just thought it looked better. My images also have entrance and exit huts on the splash ride track. Those do not need to be there. I also have the peep entrance FAR from the boarding platform, which causes all the peeps to walk on the water from the entrance to the platform.

This park is heavily inspired by the likes of Matsku and Lunatim, and to me it seems more like work than like fun. The best thing about building this park was that it was fun: I went in with no plan, just a vague idea for a launched steeplechase ride, and then just let my imagination run wild! If you're struggling along with realism, I'd recommend going right back to basics and giving something like this a go.

I'm just going to do a 200ft tall hyper twister and try to keep it compact.  Let's see if I can get an 8 or 8.5 excitement rating on a flat land coaster...

(it came out to 8.55

Station:

Build it off the ground.  Not too high, that's 20 or 25 mph you don't have to worry about.

Also


Note that I'm starting at the back of the station:

http://i.imgur.com/9HPCG.jpg

I like to go ahead and complete the last few pieces of track.  It gives you a different target that's a lot more flexible if things don't line up at the end.  I mean


Block brakes plus a block of 3 progressive brakes for the 2nd train:   http://i.imgur.com/ydFdb.jpg

An ending element that's better than just jack-knifing the track around to line up with the station (note that there's a 50% chance I'll rethink this at the end): http://i.imgur.com/3x3bv.jpg

Lift hill

I usually put a small drop and a pretty wide turn out of the station, you get some speed right out of the station.  Leaves room for the entrance path on that side, too.

http://i.imgur.com/9fxM2.jpg

I like all my coasters to be realistic so my hyper coasters almost always have a 200ft first drop.

What I did here was take it to 225 feet, this let's me use the smoother steep to flat conversion at the bottom and ends up exactly ground level.  You may have to rebuild your lift hill a few times to get it just right.

http://i.imgur.com/ggwUs.jpg

THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL COASTERS:  When your train flies at high speed at ground level


I almost always go for a big second drop as well.  At the crest of each hill, so at this level, we want to reduce the height of the 2nd hill more than usual.  I'm guessing somewhere around 180 feet will be ideal:

http://i.imgur.com/zMX8c.jpg

For hyper coasters

So, and put it on test.  I've set the view to look at train1.  I'm watching to see how fast it goes over the top of that first hill:

http://i.imgur.com/kXs8n.jpg

32mph is what it actually crested at.  Not too shabby.

Now comes the fun part.

Comments and corrections are welcome.  If  you learned something




Continued...

Alright

http://i.imgur.com/l1Rhk.jpg

Seems like I had it in the shot

I tried 2 large curved down tracks but it doesn't line up at ground level.  If you follow the highlighted square

http://i.imgur.com/6bNm7.jpg

I crested the last hill at under 40mph so I'm reducing the height of the next hill some...

http://i.imgur.com/BQVwG.jpg

I went ahead and built a track back to the station to test the speed at the top of that 2nd hill and it was right at 40 mph...

http://i.imgur.com/QRoJc.jpg

I took the next hill at 140ft using the large arch at the top.

http://i.imgur.com/PJnxh.jpg

Enough up and down and up and down

http://i.imgur.com/liMgN.jpg

Then wide out to one side

http://i.imgur.com/ZdfgV.jpg

That helix is way too fast for most twisters and it will drive my intensity rating up, compact and cheap.  I'll sacrifice some intensity for excitement.


I tried a height of 135ft for the next hill and got this:

http://i.imgur.com/idwm6.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/wtl6L.jpg

Way too slow.  So I went back and shaved it down to 115ft.

http://i.imgur.com/aAk6L.jpg

Using the steep to level slope at the bottom I ended up with a low height of 15ft.  This puts my track right where it needs to be to run over top of that other track that's at 5ft.

http://i.imgur.com/auq1l.jpg

Another twist and I can cross right over the other track and give myself some room to go back uphill.

http://i.imgur.com/rLAb5.jpg

The last hill was 115ft

http://i.imgur.com/sRahG.jpg

To keep the track tight I'm going to turn it around here and head back into the meat of the coaster.  There's not much track between these 2 hills so it's safe to go back up to 100ft again.

http://i.imgur.com/fczBP.jpg

Again

http://i.imgur.com/kQaen.jpg

In the interest of using as many different track pieces as I can

http://i.imgur.com/LCIX8.jpg

And by building some connecting pieces back to the station

http://i.imgur.com/CCQZY.jpg

Now

http://i.imgur.com/Q7qyV.jpg

Niiiiiice.  It even looks pretty nice. http://i.imgur.com/jFBtx.jpg 

Sometimes

OK

http://i.imgur.com/eQzRU.jpg

Of all the track pieces

http://i.imgur.com/Oxjk2.jpg

I see a lot of people building coasters here where it looks like they try to avoid going back into the twisting

A large helix after that drop to lose some speed:

http://i.imgur.com/Gp1kM.jpg


Here I was able to land at 15ft again

http://i.imgur.com/08Njq.jpg

With those pieces in place I was able to connect back to the station for a test run to make sure that block brake section isn't too high.  It crawls up there at about 15mph which

http://i.imgur.com/qvP78.jpg

Here I've added a hill, I'm headed back into the meat of the coaster.

http://i.imgur.com/tRZgd.jpg

Some turns and another helix:

http://i.imgur.com/zduVD.jpg

I really didn't think this next part would work.  But that's usually when I head straight in there.  If it looks like it won't work then you know the tracks will be close on all sides and you'll get some extra excitement.  Turns out

http://i.imgur.com/O0hIh.jpg

Squeeeeze through there...

http://i.imgur.com/EBrKd.jpg

Alright, you can see them in the final product.  It's just a couple of helix,  2 small hills and then back to the helix I put in at the end of the station when I began.

http://i.imgur.com/zy7I8.jpg

8.55exc / 8.65int  Totally flat land with no scenery

Here's the finished product if you want to download it.

http://www.sendspace.com/file/qx4tpm

I know sendspace sucks

Here it is in a park with paths

http://i.imgur.com/iJakD.jpg

This is not my ""best track"" by any means.  I was drunk last night and bored so I thought I'd throw something together.  If you spend a little more time getting all the elements lined up right where you want them you can easily pull off a 9 or 9.5 excitement flat land coaster.

1376623769.0,1kgs75,pH's Guide to Ride Types,pHScale,26,5,12,"Hey guys

I decided to make an all-in-one resource to find whatever kind of ride references you may need, awards, manufacturers, etc.

---

###How to Use This Guide

This guide is meant to be a portal to good references you can use to find information on real life rides. Real life is often great inspiration for RCT parks.

You may want to create a custom flat ride for RCT2

I will continue to update this as I get more information.

---

###Existing Ride Databases

There are several very good databases you can look at that keep historical records of rides. Some keep track of them differently than others

- The [Rollercoaster Database](http://rcdb.com/) is a great source of information on rollercoasters from wild mice, to the newest ones being built. It is a record, complete with photo galleries in most cases, of almost every roller coaster to be built around the world. 
http://rcdb.com/

- [Flat Joint](http://www.flatrides.com/rideindex.html) has a very extensive list of flat rides and kiddie rides, as well as typical ride capacity. Pictures are also provided, as well as the manufacturer's name, which is very useful in determining the difference between, say, a Fabbri Pirate Ship and a Huss Pirate Boat. http://www.flatrides.com/rideindex.html

- The [European Water Ride Database](http://ewrdb.com/rides/) is a great resource for finding flumes, they are *not* a resource for water slides and other waterpark attractions. Pictures and stats are provided for most of the rides here. However, there doesn't' seem to be an american or worldwide equivalent site, so although there is a good chance you will find what you're looking for, you may not be able to. http://ewrdb.com/

- The [Water Slide Database](http://www.waterslidedatabase.com/apps/photos/) is a fledgling website documenting contributors experiences at waterparks. Since waterparks are so numerous

---

###Manufacturers

\**Links to active manufacturer's websites soon to come*

I'm going to try to create my own list of ride manufacturers split into four categories that match those listed above. This list isn't meant to be exhaustive.

###Communities

Several Communities exist outside of Reddit addressing different aspects of the industry.

- [NewElement Designs](http://www.nedesigns.com/) is an active

- [ShyGuy's World](http://www.shyguysworld.com/) is similar to NewElement

- [Theme Park Review](http://www.themeparkreview.com/) is a community of Theme Park Enthusiasts. Trip Reports, and rumors abound here.

- [CoasterForce](http://www.coasterforce.com/) is another community of enthusiasts. A great feature of their website is the park guides section.

- [American Coaster Enthusiasts](http://www.aceonline.org/) is the dominant theme park fan club. It's kind of like the tabloids of the theme park industry. Sometimes they're right

###How You Can Contribute

I know this list is not as complete as it could be. I would like your help in telling me what could or should be added. Right now, or haven't had the time to compile yet.

- A Dark Ride Manufacturer's short list

- A Dark Ride Database

- Better Waterslide and Water ride databases

- More Waterslide Manufacturers

- A Scenery Manufacturer's short list

- A list of NCSO rides in each of the three games

Since the community is voting more influences who wins than guidelines I offer this advice: The goal is to make this like a State Fair

Here is the scenario: http://min.us/mk9KHsc38

But think about it; They built the Glassbox engine to handle a simulation on a 1:1 scale (or so they claim). Plus, so you could build a ride sticking to the grid like normal, but then have a section that breaks from the grid and snaps back on when it's done.

On the other hand, going by what I've heard from Simcity posts, doesn't happen, let alone each guest having a name, stats, thoughts, items, since I don't know how optimized the engine is to begin with.

And since the Glassbox engine can go online (obviously...), or multiple people working together on one mega-park.

**Part 1: What not to do**
http://imgur.com/Qf9hYyK - this is an example of all the wrong things in one ride. (except going fast over hills)

|1 car trains

|Never go over 55km/h (34mp/h)

|Going over 40 km/h (29mp/h) at the top of a hill; It will make the ride crash

|Make sure all hils and drops are small

|The ride should be compact

**Part 2: Things to do**
http://i.imgur.com/YD7jsdU.png - This is a good example of some nice side friction coasters. The one on the left is much more unrealistic but has nicer stats

|Keep the ride height under 15

|Go around 20-35km/h(12-21mp/h) around turns

|Drop height should be at 4 units maximum, and is unrealistic

|Make sure that most turns are large
