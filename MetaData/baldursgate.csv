It has come to my attention that Baldur's Gate is a very confusing game to those who haven't play 2nd Edition D&amp;D. In an effort to alleviate this somewhat, and some basics of party composition. Beginners, you are welcome to use the guide in its current form. It shouldn't lead you too far astray. Experienced players, I would love to hear some feedback. Let me know what you think is good, what you think needs more work, and what needs to be added that the guide doesn't cover. Thanks bunches.

1358379623.0,16psmx,"If you buy it on Steam, for convenience sake, please also buy it on Beamdog. Here's why.",Beeht,86,82

**1)** In order to get BG:EE and BG2:EE up and running

""Royalty-wise


**2)** There are going to be people, it is unlikely that Steam will allow Beamdog product keys of BG:EE to be used so that people are forced to purchase the game again on Steam. This is going to get a large group of people to ask for a refund from the developers at Beamdog so they can purchase it on Steam instead. By doing this, Overhaul loses a huge amount of money per game sold as it goes to Steam instead.

""This is through Atari


**3)** Overhaul cannot push updates to Steam directly or even see how well the game is doing like they can through Beamdog. So when a patch gets pushed it will likely have to go through an additional process before it gets applied.

""Atari has the digital distribution rights for the Baldur's Gate license. We can't deal directly with Steam but we'll still receive a portion of the sales. We can't push updates ourselves and we won't know how well it's doing until Atari tells us."" **-Coriander

**TL;DR** Atari and Steam get most of the money, and don't expect same day updates like on Beamdog. If you choose to buy it on Steam please also consider buying it on Beamdog to support the developers! Potentially cutting the amount of money the developers get is going to be detrimental to the possibility of another Baldur's Gate game.",,False,self,t5_2t07j,1358448236.0,,

A lot of newer games try to be immersive by trying to make the graphics look as realistic as possible, lacking detail but gaining in your imagination. I can fill in all the details myself! 


I actually played BG2 BEFORE the first one, playing BG1, I checked some tips videos on youtube. Doing that helped me a lot in understanding mechanics and such. Now I find the game really enjoyable, and rewarding. It is still a challenging game though, but hey.... you can't expect a party of naive younglings clearing out an Ankheg nest!

As you may know

So

TL;DR: ~~poorly~~ Magic.

Long story: Ok, this moves the conflict staging forward, and after a certain number of antagonistic interactions (the number is randomly generated each time you load the game), there comes the chance for that check to give the option to fight. That chance is determined by a number of factors; the ""base chance"" that a fight has to occur, your PC's charisma score, and some other ""hidden"" factors for each NPC interaction. The thing to note is that the chances are tied to the NPC who initiates the fight, not tied to the fight itself occuring.

For example, they will eventually come to blows (100% base chance of occuring) after a certain amount of time antagonizing each other, that they get to make a chance to actually fight, ending with Minsc usually bashing Edwin's head in nine times out of ten. However, if you can split them up, having Minsc and Edwin will not actually trigger a fight, but will increase the chance of  Dynaheir and Edwin going at it one-on-one. In addition, which increases the amount of time they'll tolerate each other (i.e. weights the random number generator in favor of higher amount of interactions before they fight).

So for some specifics:

(The percentages were taken from the original game code

* Edwin vs Dynaheir (100% for both

Other non-cooperative party members include:
 
* Khalid and Jaheira who have a serious beef with Xzar and Montaron (Base 50% chance)

* Eldoth who'll pick a fight with Shar-Teel (50%)

* Quayle is disgusted by Tiax (33%) as is Branwen (10%)

* Yeslick hates Kagain (29%).

* Ajantis who'll attack anyone who's evil (10% but you can call him off). 

In addition to these conflicts, with normal play (i.e. no cheat console), will never come to blows: Tiax can attack Branwen (0%), and Viconia and Kivan can also come to blows (base 0% for both of them starting it).

Here is a list of a number of ""known"" hidden modifiers (the ones marked with an * were gathered from corroborated personal testimonies around the internet and may not actually be modifiers

* Your Reputation score: some conflicts will not happen with a high Rep, if the NPC is unhappy with your rep, the chance of conflict increases.

* The PC's Charisma is 17 or more (or if PC is a Paladin or Bard) will reduce the amount of conflicts to very, and Ajantis* (who doesn't give a fuck). 

* Alora is in the party: the Dynaheir/Edwin fight will take longer to occur.

* Xan is in the party: Ajantis will never attack anyone (Xan ""talks him out of it"").

* Having Minsc in the party: Reduces the chance of Dynaheir starting the fight to 50%. Does not affect Edwin's chance

* Finishing the Naskel Mines quest increases the chance of the Khalid

* Refusing to mention Xzar and Montaron's similar mission to Naskel when first recruiting Khalid and Jaheira affects how soon they'll fight* (it's unknown if it increases or decreases it). However

* Having Quayle in the party will prevent Branwen from fighting Tiax (instead, which may explain with Tiax will never attack Branwen.

* Having Safana reduces the chance of Shar-teel fighting Eldoth

* And others.

Is it really tactical to rest &amp; ""relearn"" different spells
*  **The tone is surprisingly modern.** Going into this game, the protagonist - whose character is made evident via the journal entries and dialogue options - seems pretty cynical about the whole endeavor, frequently being outright sarcastic or otherwise belittling the predictability of the events around her.  Somewhat ironically, this ""classic"" almost reads as a parody of RPGs more than a genre-defining piece itself.
* **The protagonist is ""fixed"" not entirely unlike the way Shepard is.** Her options in dialogue frequently amounted to ""nice"" or ""nasty"" versions of the same thing, and sometimes kill some dudes instead of talking (or talk instead killing some dudes), but despite hours of aimless wandering in the early game, the course is essentially fixed.  Considering all the internet fanboy whining about how much deeper and more sophisticated the older RPGs are supposed to be (when compared to modern Bioware stuff) this was surprising.
* **The expansion content is generally superior to the main game content.** Although the expansion content features less open exploration and more linear sidequests
* **Christ, than this game easily ate up hundreds of hours of my life over the last few years.  I didn't do every little niggling quest, but I think I saw all of the major elements.
* **Character progression is really satisfying.** The double-edged sword of D&amp;D is that, not leveling) makes a huge difference and feels very good.  Maybe for not totally the right reasons, though.

All items went to mirroring or countering them. I got the lion summoning statue to counter guen

So I play through the whole game looking to live out a childhood fantasy and play with and against Drizzt Do'urden. Here's the kicker... I come out of the underdark and move on getting very excited to play with my childhood hero. 

Apparently they designed the AI specifically to counter people with my dreams. Drizzt got VERY pissed at my use of his name and attacked me without any option to be on the same team. Just called me out for copying him and attacked. So i couldn't play with him. All I could do was kill him...

I grew up playing Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment when they came out

Perhaps it's just my fondness for the other games

First off, and there's more dungeon crawling than the other titles.  I feel that the lack of a main character or any banter helps me get attached to all the members of my party rather than a single one as I can easily imagine their opinions and interactions.

I also feel that the game is mechanically very sound.  There's still some clunkiness to the UI which was fixed in the later games, and loot progression was done better than the other games.

*Greetings fellow Bhaalspawn!*

With the release of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition approaching

We could think of no better way than to hold a contest for all of you with **five (5)** copies of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition up for grabs (and maybe even some custom flair).  Even better

Before I get into the details of the individual contests

1. **Only accounts created on or before 11/21 with positive comment karma will be allowed entry.**
2. **Only reply to this post as an entry to the contest.  There will be an official reply to this post for questions and discussion.**
3. **The contests end on Tuesday

Other than that

***
##Contest 1: Murder Mystery!

Prizes: 1 Copy of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

*There is a murderer wandering the Sword Coast as we speak! Nashkel native Noober was found, increased bandit activity, and Commander Brage on the run from the law, the town of Nashkel has requested your assistance in the investigation of this grisly crime.  The local officers have determined the body has been moved from the original location of the murder and that there was sea salt caked in the victim's hair.  Additionally, the victim died from a series of slashes and stab wounds, but none higher than his stomach.  If you can help solve this case, the reward will be great indeed!*

This contest is similar to the board game ""Clue"" if you are familiar with it.  However, the **murder weapon** used, and the **name of the murderer**.  We know there is little to go on, so this is a bit of a guessing game.  But, with the clues available, your options should be greatly narrowed down.  Again, in a reply to this post

1. The name of the murderer (restricted to recruitable NPCs available in BG1+TotSC)
2. The murder weapon used (restricted to weapons available in BG1+TotSC)
3. The murder location (restricted to overland locations available in BG1+TotSC)

Anyone found posting multiple entries will be disqualified.

All we can say is, we will award the prize to the person who guessed the closest and if there are multiple equally close entries, the winner will be randomly selected from among them.
***
##Contest 2: Trivia!

Prizes: 1 Copy of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

*Puzzled are you

*Maybe your mind is a little bit dim.*

*Seen all there is in this land

*Finish my quiz first

Okay, you must **PM your answers to me** before the end of the contest.  Do not include your answers to the trivia in a reply to this post please.  Any posts found with answers to the trivia questions, even if incorrect, will be removed and the user disqualified.  We want to keep it fair for everyone.  Now for the questions:

1. In your very home of Candlekeep you are attacked by a pair of would-be assassins.  What are the names of these two?
2. Near the ambush after leaving Candlekeep
3. The artist Prism required emeralds to truly bring life to the face of his sculpture. Who was he sculpting?
4. In the heart of the bandit camp stands the leader of the Black Talon
5. Infiltrating the Cloakwood Mines you find a pair of Boots of Speed.  What was the catchphrase of the original owner of the boots?
6. The Thieves Guild in the city of Baldur's Gate took a liking to you.  What is the password to enter their hideout?
7. A famous priest is visiting Candlekeep when you return.  Who is it?
8. If you are arrested by the Flaming Fist when you return to Baldur's Gate
9. The Demonknight who has taken over Durlag's Tower has a powerful artifact to assist him in battle.  What is it?
10. After travelling the entirety of the Sword Coast

Remember, no matter how (in)correct, will be removed and the user disqualified.  Also, only one entry per person.  There is no rush beyond getting the entry in before the end of the contest, so take your time to perfect your entry.  After you have entered, **you will not be allowed to adjust your entry**.

I imagine we will get a number of correct entries for this contest, the winner will be randomly selected from among the correct entries.  There is no benefit to being the first one to answer.  We want everyone to have a chance to enter.
***
##Contest 3: Raffle!

Prizes: 3 Copies of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

*Ok, insult throwing, pun hurling, hostage taking, iron mongering, smart arsed fools, freaks, mettle, patience! If you've got a straight answer ANYWHERE in that bent little head of yours

This contest is the easiest of them all.  Anyone who replies to this post will be entered into a raffle to win one of three copies of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.  Even better, simply edit your original reply with your answers for the murder mystery.  Remember, only one entry per person.

***

We hope you all find these contests as fun to enter as we have had creating them.  Remember, there will be an official reply to this post where you may ask questions or discuss the contests.

    3. Extract the source package
    4. On lines 48 and 49, but it works and hasn't caused any problems for me).
    5. cd to ../../tools, you should probably go out to lunch or rent a movie or something.
    6. Run winecfg to set up wine for first time configuration.
    7. NOW you can run the GOG setup file with wine.
* Download GemRB from wherever you want... If you're on Arch
* Copy /etc/gemrb/GemRB.cfg sample to ~/.gemrb/GemRB.cfg and use GemRB.cfg to set up your game. Some tips here:
    1. Every CD path should point to *your/wine/install/location/Baldur's Gate 2/data/*. The GamePath should be set to */your/wine/install/location/Baldur's Gate 2*. 
    2. gemRBPath should point to */usr/share/gemrb/*
    3. PluginsPath should point to */lib/gemrb/plugins/*
    4. If you need any more help with this

* Run your game simply by typing ""gemrb"" or using the gemrb binary executable that you got when you downloaded and installed GemRB.

Have fun! Higher resolutions should be supported pretty well.

I got Shadowkeeper working for BGEE. Here's what I did:

1. Follow directions for Windows in the OP at http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/6950/player-how-to-getting-mods-to-work-on-bgee/p1
2. This will allow you to access Item/Spell/Creature Browsers
3. [Open an elevated command prompt.](http://www.sevenforums.com/performance-maintenance/69221-how-open-elevated-command-prompt.html) If you are using Windows XP
4. Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\Data\00766 or wherever your chitin.key file is
5. Type the following:

    mklink /J .\save\ ""C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\save""        
6. Run Shadowkeeper. It will probably tell you your installation path is incorrect
7. Go to Settings
8. Browse to C:\Program Files (x86)\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\Data\00766\ or wherever your chitin.key file is saved.
9. Click OK. It will warn you that the Shadows of Amn executable was not found
10. It will tell you to restart Shadowkeeper. Do so

Backing up your saved games before editing is HIGHLY recommended

For example, half-elves are stated to have fighter/druid, druid/mage, and fighter/mage/druid as multiclass options. Obviously, only fighter/druid was implemented. Beyond the manual, if you were to go back to the 2nd edition rules, you could also have combinations such as ranger/druid or even ranger/mage (from what I gathered from other forums; I don't have any personal experience before 3e pnp). 

I understand balance would be an issue, would it really be a bad thing? I don't see how it would really impact those who don't want the extra options. It's not like if I played a druid/mage in my game then it would ruin someone else's personal game. And if I personally didn't want the new combos, I just wouldn't play them.

Perhaps if classes are externalized (not sure if that's the right term) sufficiently

(possible spoilers),CrystallineWondercow,25,0,14,"Did you start from BG1 or was SoA or ToB your first exposure to the bhaalspawn saga? What class did you play? Who was in your first party? What do you remember about your initial impressions? Were you a D&amp;D noob

My first experience with the game was when I was in 7th grade shortly after Shadows of Amn was released in 2001. My friend's older brother blew through the game as he had played the first game and was eager for the second. My friend and I sat in the closet that his family computer was kept in and spent hours creating characters

My first character was a fighter/mage/thief because I had no idea what was powerful and figured that 3 classes is better than one. I absolutely loved pick pocketing everyone so most of my thief skills went to that. I didn't have any mind for tactics so all of my mage spells went to strait up damage spells, Arie, Anoman and Yoshimo. I remember getting pissed in Spellhold when Yoshimo betrayed me and getting Imoen back, severely underleveled. I ditched her as soon as possible and picked up Jan, who was still underleveled but a hilarious character to have around where as Imoen just seemed whiny. I didn't really get into the game play and mechanics until my second and third playthough usually, but I found the story and fights so engrossing and epic that it kept me going. I learned about cheat codes not far into my first playthough, (editing the .ini file made me feel kind of like a hacker) so I abused the hell out of them. I ctrl+J'd around all of the maps and spammed ctrl+R'd on my party though most fights (and still was not able to kill any of the dragons). Despite all of this noobishness I rushed home from school every day to play and have come back to the game and played BG1 - ToB+Ascension at least 4 times since then. I hope I never get tired of this series.

My friend and I found Suldanessellar hilarious because we pronounced it ""Sold-in-a-cellar

Also the manual for this game was amazing. I still read over it occasionally

&gt; In order to fix things more efficiently

&gt; If your game crashes, but also why it's causing your game to crash, which will allow the developers to find a solution.

&gt; Finally--and this is very important: Do not install a mod on your game unless it has been confirmed to be compatible with the Enhanced Edition. This is ultimately the root cause of a lot of the problems people are experiencing (or enough to warrant this reminder, but it still may take some time to update all of them. Installing the old mods can cause instabilities in your game, which may cause the game to crash or render it otherwise unplayable.

EDIT: [Regarding crashes and being unable to start the game](http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/comment/177296/#Comment_177296):

&gt; The problem is the non-start issue is a variety of a bunch of different issues depending on the person.

1. We have an announcement bar!  Okay, but for the most part it will remain with a default message similar to what it is currently.

2. GOG.com is not the only place to buy Baldur's Gate online.  Sure it is convenient and has its perks, please let us know!

3. There are so many resources online for the Baldur's Gate games.  Mechanics summaries and overviews, items, monsters, npcs, etc.  These are just the best ones I know of.  Again, if you know of others, please let us know. EDIT: Other Infinity Engine games were not explicitly included because of space restrictions and relevance.  However, so similar information is still close at hand.

4. Modding for Baldur's Gate is still very active and has been seeing a resurgence with the Enhance Edition announcement.  Not to mention all of the older mods which are still perfectly functional and useful.  Hopefully

5. I am making a separate point for this because of its subjective nature, they can be added, but the list should remain small.

6. There is now a ""Related Subreddits"" section.  Right now it is rather short, things like /r/gaming and /r/games are popular enough that we do not need to include them.

Hey guys


I'm just wondering if anyone else is playing the big world project.  For those that don't know - its a mod that essentially installs a MASSIVE amount of mods for BG1&amp;2.  Tons of new areas to explore, side quests, NPC's, romances - everything.  (To put it in a different perspective, my Baldur's Gate folder is now over 48GB - not a typo)


Honestly


With that said


I *think* this might be because much of the installation info for BWP is outdated - many of the links for necessary files are missing or are hard to find.  I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a detailed write up that we could put in the side bar.  I saved all the files that I needed and I scoured the internet trying to make sure I had everything I needed - in other words


Mods - Would something like this be side-bar worthy?  I can't tell you how frustrated I was to find 3-4 installation guides that had wrong or incomplete or outdated info.

he was unstoppable

he was one hit stunning aerie

most of the party couldn't even hit him and nobody was scoring any serious damage. it was like stick fighting with a cement wall


.... but oddly nobody in my party was dying either so it dragged out for an unnaturally long time
mage spells were emptied

potions were burnt through like diet coke at a mentos convention

it was beyond hopeless. It was futile. I fought for all i was worth, and I knew it
and finally
there was a most anticlimactic little POOF and the big red dragon was no more

I am writing this because I am in the middle of writing my Master Thesis in marketing and business innovation, to help me gather data, I am writing here.    
    



So what do I need from you?
Well my thesis are taking on one of the big questions: Why do people make mods…? (It might be phrased just a little bit different in my paper
…And to answer this question
   

So you might be thinking, will it be time consuming etc.? 
Well – Firstly I need you to answer some questions, via a PM message to me. 
Then I need you to indicate, and maybe an interview (can be done with Skype or another preferred communication form, both in text or voice). If you do not feel like being contacted further, I will still very much like to have your answers , just answer no to the last question and then I will bother you no more – just don’t let the contacting part being the reason that that you reject answering the questions in this thread…    

   
So what will you get for doing this:
Well, for helping another in need, and maybe you also end up learning a thing or two about you own secret and dark motives for being part of the modding community (but I can not guaranty it).
So if you are up for it please answer the following questions either in a comment in this thread

    

We start with a typical ASL
What is your age?
What is your gender?
What country are you from?     
     

Then I also need some specifics about your relationship with Baldurs Gate:    
What was the first Baldurs Gate game you played (BG1 (with or without ToSC)
When did you play your first BG game? (Just in general terms, “just recently” etc.)
Which of the games and its expansions have you played, BG:EE, ToSW, ToB)
Have you played through any BG games more than once? If yes
    

And now I need some information about what my thesis is actually about: 
Have you ever successfully made a modification to any BG game? (Succesfully here meaning
If yes, and list the rest generally (like weapons mods, NPC mods etc.)  
-	In which game(s)?
Do you consider yourself a “modder”? 
-	Why/Why not?
If you consider yourself a modder, just skip these questions:
Why do you decide to start a new project?
Do you make mods that you do not use in your own games? If yes
How do you get your ideas? (Could be other people that have requested something
Do you enjoy modding
If you had to finish the sentence:” I would rather spend my time modding than…” what would you finish the sentence with? Please give at least three possible answers.     
     


Okay second to last section of questions (we are almost there…) (And the people not identifying as modders can jump back on the wagon here):
Do you ever download mods for any BG game? 
If yes
Why do you download those mods? (If more types
Would you enjoy BG games less/more/the same if there were no mods available?
Can you identify mods that are, as the core game?         

     
Okay last section
What game genres do you play the most (Maximum 3 answers)?
When buying a game
Which games have you played recently (last 3-6 months)?      

    

And

    
With hope that many of you will help me by answering this

1320148902.0,lwc38,Just beat BG1 for the first time! My thoughts...,Plob218,21,2,36,"First off, these nits aren't going to pick themselves...

My first problem: I hate the magic system. I think it's clunky and discourages experimentation. My PC was a mage and I spent most of the game literally sitting on the sidelines throwing rocks at enemies because I wanted to save my spells for a really hard battle. I also don't understand it from a RPing perspective; How the heck can you ""memorize"" multiple copies of the same spell? Why do you forget it after casting it?

My second problem is with how brutally you are punished for not saving after every few steps. Don't get me wrong, and it's even worse after half an hour or more of unsaved progress. There weren't a lot of these moments in the game, but the handful I came across irked me.

There isn't enough equipment, the only things I needed to buy were arrows and bullets. More often than not, the stuff you do find in dungeons isn't even that exciting; ""Long Sword +2"" is great in function, but doesn't exactly stir the imagination.

I also think the game is a *little* too talky. My game felt like 60% talking, and so far I like the pacing of it better (although the story is way more generic than BG...). It's also too short. I was only level 9 when I beat the main quest, and that's after doing most of the side quests in the game. I hadn't even unlocked level 5 spells. I haven't done the expansion content yet, but I wish the main quest would bring you to at least level 12 or 13 without having to grind xp.

I think those are the only problems I had with the game itself. Everything else I didn't like about it was because of my own ignorance of D&amp;D rules. For example, wands, scrolls, use them all. Selling them gets you a lot of money, but once you're initially equipped a few hundred gold will last you the entire game.

The good stuff? Party management is a breeze. Once you set your initial formation in the beginning, even in more modern games. The characters you can recruit are entertaining and cover a wide range of casts, alignments, and personality types.

3. Go to ""%programfiles(x86)%\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\Data"" and rename ""766.beam"" and ""766.status""
4. Go to ""%UserProfile%\Documents"" and rename the ""Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition"" folder (Note: THIS IS WHERE YOUR SAVEGAMES LIVE.)
5. Start the Launcher again.

This should fix most issues.

For other issues:  
An updated version of OpenAL (2.1.0.0) that is more current than the one found on the Creative home page (2.0.7.0) can be found here: 
http://www.mediafire.com/?8wya3v4zx0hvgm1

If you have the issue of the game not starting after you clicked ""Play"":  
Open the Startmenu, UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS. If you already HAVE the latest drivers, copy the crash information from there and email support@beamdog.com

Some logfiles can be found at: ""%localappdata%\BeamDog\BGEE\Logs""
These may be of interest to some of you.


I will update this thread as information pours in - however, since I can't play thanks to a crash. :(


**Major Edit
If you have a Laptop with nVidia Optimus: Rightclick baldur.exe

If your game will not launch and eventvwr.msc shows crashes related to:

* DLLs who's name starts with ""msvc"": Download dxwebsetup.exe from Microsoft &amp; install it. Download the Visual C++ 2010/2008/2005 Redistributables and install them.
* atioglxx.dll: If you have this, but I guess other options will work too.

**Murder Mystery**

Winner: kynax

*The town of Nashkel has sent their heartfelt thanks for the efforts of all the individuals involved in the investigation of the grisly murder.  With your efforts, Montaron was found innocent of the murder of Noober.  His alibi held up and his short sword did not match the wounds found on the victim.  However, as he was about to be released, Harper agents arrived to take him away and wished to reward your efforts in helping apprehend the Zhentarim agent.  It is unfortunate the killer remains on the loose, but an even more dangerous criminal was taken in thanks to you.*

I would like to apologize here for a moment.  One aspect of this contest was not as clear as it should have been, and locations the solution was random.  The solution we were looking for was:

*Quayle at the Lighthouse with a Long Sword.*

The narrative description was provided to narrow down the choices without completely giving it away, according to the rules of the contest, everyone who made that choice (as well as the one person who guessed Quayle) was on even footing for the contest.

You'll need the following:

* $10 or the GOG.com version of BG
* Windows 7 (It probably works with other versions
* A microphone and Skype (for voice chat)

Here are the steps to get set up:

1. **Buy Baldur's Gate from GOG.com** ([Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/baldurs_gate_the_original_saga)) ([Baldur's Gate 2 Complete](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/baldurs_gate_2_complete/))  They are $10 each
1. **Install BG or BG2** to your main drive (usually this is your C:\ drive).  Some people have had problems with Windows permissions if they install to the Programs folders
1. **Download and install Gameranger**  ([Gameranger.com](http://www.gameranger.com/))  I've tried messing with port forwarding on my router and getting the right IP and firewall settings
1. **Download and install Skype**  ([Skype.com](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/windows/))  Gameranger supposedly offers voice-chat
1. Open the **Baldur's Gate ""Config"" file**.  Navigate to the folder you installed Baldur's Gate,000.  You'll probably also want to increase the framerate to 40 fps or so.  (Make sure ALL parties have the same framerate or you won't be able to play together.)  Most people prefer to increase the game resolution (1024x768 works well for my screen size) and use Windowed mode.
1. Run Gameranger and have the host **start a game**.  Go to File&gt;Host Game...  Pick the correct ""Baldur's Gate"" game, landing you in the multiplayer Character Arbitration screen.
1.  (Optional) **Run Skype** and call each other to use voice-chat alongside your game.

My first time playing D&amp;D Core Rules difficulty

Personally I think BioWare is taking steps in a direction that their oldest and biggest fans don't want. I.E. away from BG game mechanics and complexity and more towards action-RPGs (Diablo). Dragon Age: Origins to Dragon Age 2 was IMO a huge step backwards in this regard. 


It's seems except outside a couple top-notched PC developers (CD Projekt Red being one) and the Roguelike community, but you can turn off dialogue options so you don't have to choose what your character says... In a BioWare RPG. Not that that's an huge issue for me, but I think it reinforces my point.

You know, you have to face breaking armor etc... and that is fine in fact, because that's quite realistic. (I'll skip goblins having some peasants' live savings as a loot). Still, for something like half the game everything is fine and magical items are very precious, you're not that rich.
But then something goes wrong and you are becoming move and more epic. In terms of the story and satisfaction it kicks ass

It is even more visible in Shadows of Amn. Almost every shopkeeper has some expensive and rare items (katanas for everyone!)

This has led to thinking - how would BG look without all its epicness. Would it be a better game? How would it play with a low-xp party and with only some magical items. I don't mean any special challenge but rather the way the game's world would actually look like.

1319817425.0,lsaq0,Installing BiG World &amp; playing it multiplayer,TrentFoxingworth,19,3,11,"So my friend and I recently decided to play through the most modded

* Make absolutely sure you don't install Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II to the default (program files) folder. The installation won't work correctly if you do.

* Make sure you do a complete full install of BG1 and its expansion. In BG2 you just choose ""full"" as the install size

* Install the official ToTSC patch [from here](http://www.sorcerers.net/Games/dl.php?s=BG&amp;f=../Games2/BG/BGTalesUS5512.exe) and the ToB patch [from here](http://www.sorcerers.net/Games/dl.php?s=BG2&amp;f=../Games2/BG2/BGII-ThroneofBhaal_Patch_26498_ENGLISH.exe)

* Make sure you start a new game in BG1

* Based on the updated date and number of downloads, it takes care of downloading everything else you need and installing it all.

* When you run the setup it will ask you if you want to try to auto update anything. You have to hit ""no"" to find updates or the installer glitches out on a later screen and won't let you continue. Hitting ""yes"" won't find any updates so you might think it's fine and you can go from there

* The setup fails in a couple ways along the way. The first is that it won't find all the mods to download. Hit retry a couple times, so be prepared to google for 'em. In my install (I chose the tactics version of BiG World), I didn't end up finding or using the Touchstone or Nikitalleria NPC mods. I was able to find two missing mods: [Legion of Hell: The Mod itself](http://cias.rit.edu/~dxw7298/BG/LOHMod.zip) on some chinese forum, and [Paladins of Faerun Kitpack](http://cias.rit.edu/~dxw7298/BG/PoF_Kitpack_V5.rar) as an attachment on a BiG World forum post. **EDIT: **Downloads now courtesy of Dim3tapp.

* For any mods you do have to find on the net

* The setup now tries to reconcile what you downloaded with its internal mod list. So you have to go through the missing mods one by one and select the archive for each of the mods it wants. Some of the file sizes don't match up with what it expects

* After downloading all the mods it can (and you supplying the ones it can't), be it winrar, 7zip, etc. For these, just extract to the default C:\BWS\BGII - SoA folder, not the BiG World downloads folder. The other type of archive is the self-executing type, that tries to extract and then install the mod for you. You want to select the same C:\BWS\BGII - SoA folder for the extraction process, you just want to extract the files. Some of the initial popups for this type of mod might [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/iOGAJ.jpg) with an Install button

* After you extract everything, but not knowing what that entailed I chose no. Other than that, you aren't given any options.

* You'll have to install the [widescreen mod](http://www.gibberlings3.net/widescreen/) yourself at the end. Make sure you change the folder to the right directory.

* After starting the game you'll notice several things. First, you have to uninstall a mod called the ToB Extender. An easy way to do this is to find the TobEx.dll file in your BG2 folder and rename it to something else, like TobEx2.dll. Problem solved, no more disappearing characters.

* On a side note, but the one you probably want to run is called setup-bg2_tweaks.exe. By default, true grandmastery, wearing magical rings+armor, and unlimited bags of holding (among mods I consider ""standard"") aren't installed.

* The other thing I immediately noticed was some drastic rule changes regarding armor that may not be desirable. By default arcane spellcasting with armor on is possible, but personally it goes a little too far into the cheat category for me. I haven't found, or really looked for yet, the right setup file to unmod this. I guess with the rest of the game being modded so much, though, you might as well just roll with it. I did see a mod was installed that gives you every option on every cast of Wish. This is a blatent cheat if abused, so I'm not sure why it's on by default.

* It seems like a lot of the added content starts with having to have an NPC join you. As my friend and I made a party of 6 custom characters to go through the entire game

* As mentioned a while ago on this subreddit, it automatically starts up Baldur's Gate for all players and takes you right to the create (or join) game screen with the right information filled out to start playing. Very convenient.

Specifically:

* Open Locks
* Find Traps
* Pick Pockets
* Move Silently
* Hide in Shadows
* Detect Illusions
* Set Traps

I'm going to throw a few questions out there

**1)** Find Traps vs. Pick Locks for disarming traps? I've read that the Find Traps skill doubles as a Find and Disarm Traps skill. I've also read that Find Trap only spots traps

**2)** Do these skills have effective caps? For example, does this go for all the other skills as well?

**3)** Once Yoshimo reached 100 in Find Traps, and Move Silently for me, I started dumping his points into Set Traps. I noticed that once I did this, I started getting increased experience points from picking locks and disarming traps. As this makes no sense to me at all, I was curious if that was just a coincidence or not? What is the experience gain from these things based on, if not the seemingly unrelated Set Traps skill?

**4)** Do I have to be out of combat to be able to ""Hide in Shadows?"" I somehow get the impression that's not supposed to be the case

I figured I would start again and just play with whoever seems interesting at the time. Am I missing anything by just taking random party members


Heck I can't even pick a class. I like tank characters, or an assassin, or  swashbuckler, or even a barbarian... but then I figure a wizard would be awesome.

I know the Irenicus dungeon where you start catches a lot of grief - but good gravy! Even there the variety of different things that can happen depending on your playing style boggles my mind. Just for kicks I decided to try out a thief, got all sorts of potions! Then they started attacking me. This was COMPLETELY different than trying as a paladin, sorceror, and monk. Does EVERYTHING in this game change depending on what you do?? 

Tell me about funny little things like stealing the sword from the Genie that a noob to the BD series like me wouldn't think of

Even killing Torgal... he's the reason I kept remaking characters. I would play up until that point but couldn't kill him for the life of me, and Jaheira's spells did, as well as the paladin's draw upon holy might. Buffs, I think you guys call them? Oh my gosh this game is complex!

What else should we play? 

I've had quite a few replays of NWN2, and thought the story wasn't half bad, even if the hardest difficulty felt like easy in BG. I've never tried NWN1 and have heard great things. Graphics don't necessarily mean that much, but those first gen 3D games do make me hesitant. Is it worthy of a playthrough, what else would you recommend?

The worst/weirdest mod for me was an NPC mod called Saerileth:

Now

Needless to say, she just came off as this really upperty slightly psychopathic 15 year old girl that was trying desperately to act older than her years.

His reputation is 13 and charisma is 18 so it should look a little like:

10 + 5 (charisma) + 0 (reputation) = 15

Am I missing something? are dwarfs (or beserkers) unable to go above 16 charisma even with magical items?

Edit: So I figured it out. After getting a bit more reputation it worked

that means for a certain positive npc reaction with 18 charisma you need a positive rep of 16.

1357679722.0,167ebj,Mixed feelings about BG1,arcainzor,15,2,19,"I just finished BG:EE on Core Rules, I think big parts of the plot was very well written

The story was very well paced in the start. I really really liked how you started off without knowing anything, talking to and killing underling after underling untill the master scheme of Sarevok gets revealed. The issue comes right after this. I felt that after getting to the top of the Iron Throne, from the second you head off to candlekeep, everything felt really rushed. You spend over 60 hours preparing for this, building up to what looks to be an epic adventure, and then the game ends within less than 10 hours. 

In the beginning, though, I was banking such a ridiculous amount of money, there was nothing I could buy. Before heading into Durlag's Tower at level 6-7, the last place I went prior to Baldur's Gate, I had 90k Gold. As I got into Baldur's Gate and was ready to find some shops and spend all my money, I had 120k. The problem was, and I finished the game with nearly 200k gold.

I haven't played BG2, the ending. I ended the game by killing Sarevok, I don't know anything about the other ""endings"", but this fitted the best for my Cavalier. My issue is that there was no ending, you just kill Sarevok and watch a fancy death animation. There were so many unanswered questions; what happens to me, what happens to Sarevok and what happens to the world? Not really relevant to the main story, but it kinda annoyed me that I couldn't finish all the side quests that were stacked up in my Journal.

The PC is a male human chaotic good true class fighter called Elkin. He acts the party's meat shield. (Shield of Balduran is just so lol in beholder hives)

Second is a female human neutral good Kensai called Sinéad

Third is a male human true neutral true class mage called Kai. (I've never known what bonuses you get for specialising a mage

Fourth is a male human neutral good assassin called Logan. He focuses his thief skills on silent moving

Fifth is a female human chaotic good true class thief called Sapphy

And sixth is a female human lawful good priest of Lathander called Aeriel.

Sinéad has always looked up to Elkin, so did she. As much as she loved Elkin she was never in love with him, instead falling for Kai, Elkin's best friend. The two have been together since their early teens and have a strong relationship. Logan and his sister Sapphy first started as friends of Imoen, the 3 of them would always be sneaking around and getting into mischief. It was through Imoen that the 2 siblings became good friends with Elkin. Aeriel is Sapphy's best friend, but the two became very close and later developed a romantic relationship. (Sapphy was not named with this relationship in mind, I created her before Aeriel and created the relationship with Aeriel :p)

So, since it one of the few games of that era and genre I havnt played.

Im including a bard for high Cha and skillpoints in bluff
Will npc with 'scripted dialog' always pick the nearest character? 
Or is it the Player Character that have the first spot in the party?
Are there many such 'scripted dialogs'(approaching npc's and boss talks)?
Or is the cha and skills from my bard always counted for when for example my warrior is talking to someone?

I guess I could either have my bard at the 1st spot

Or just load every time there's a npc come running towards me to chat (and how does this work in boss encounters?).

(or just placing a paladin first and skipping the bard altogether

* When you get a roll of all 12+ numbers (or whatever your threshold is)

There are many things that point to some of it like:

Main character lived all his life in candlekeep with the tutor Gorion.

- this makes sense for any human character, elves and such reach adulthood somewhere after 100 years. That would make Gorion either really old or the charname really young, barely an infant in elf standards. [This ofcourse breaks with all the other bhaalspawn you encounter, assuming Bhaal did not sire them years and years before, which I guess he did](/spoiler)


The ""canon"" party leaves a free selection for the charname

- this mostly leaves him as being non-critical to the group dynamic


There are no neutral warrior NPCs

- Feels like the Charname is supposed to fill this role.


There are also some factors that are present in BG2

- One being: [Imoen


I think they should have made Gorion be the race of the Charname or some longlived race

My party: PC (Carl Chaotic Evil Gnome Fighter/Illusionist, Korgan and Edwin) which is in my opinion the best and most fun party set-up. My stats are ridiculous due to carefully planned min/maxing with stat items in mind. Everyone besides Edwin has a 18+ strength.  By selling everything not attached to the walls (and a lil' bit of selling and stealing back courtesy of Jan and his 3 Master Thievery potions) I have managed to buy Robe of Vecna and Belt of internal barrier and the strength belt from the adventurers mart. 

Now to the point: Firkraag humiliated me. I died about 20 times before I gave up. I simply don't have enough fire resistance to adequately reduce the firebreath thing Firkraag spams on me. He's also much better at disposing of my summons and why is he so much faster than the shadow dragon? 

My strategy (that failed): Buffed beyond reason, Edwin and PC plus numerous Holy Smite from Viconia (dangerous move for my party considering alignment) and I never got him down below injured. 

I bet Firkraag is immune to the damage of the fire elementals but they are just there to resist fire damage and distract anyways

I used the same strategy with earth elementals instead of fire for the Shadow dragon with much success. It took 2 re-loads to get it right.  

It seems I have much to learn yet so I ask you to help me be more sophisticated in my spell casting. What am I missing here? And don't say gaining 3 levels!

1343586797.0,xcmta,Modding plan review/advice needed,Zizzencs,9,0,3,"I decided to replay the Baldur's Gate trilogy - this time with an evil party. I have a plan on how to play this out but my knowledge about modding is not that extensive so any comments on the following details would be appreciated.

I will play from the beginning of BG1 to the end of ToB doing most of the content that's available in the game and in the selected mods. I would prefer the following:

- playing the same NPCs through the whole trilogy
- keeping both the main character and the NPCs as single-class characters.

I will play the games on insane difficulty. I also plan to include some mods that add more difficult encounters to the game.

I plan to include the following members in my party:

- Zizz - main character
- Korgan - secondary fighter
- ??? - thief, who I can keep from the beginning of BG1 to the end of ToB
- Viconia - primarily for buffing
- Edwin - as a wizard
- Xan - as a sorcerer

My questions:

- Which thief (either vanilla or modded in) would you recommend? Safana comes to my mind but she's not available in BG2 as far as I know.
- Is there a way to keep Korgan for BG2? If yes

I plan to include the following mods for additional content:

BG1

- Dark Horizons
- Dark Side of the Sword Coast
- Northern Tales of the Sword Coast
- BG1 Mini Quests and Encounters
- BG1 Unfinished Business

BG2

- Assassinations
- Fading Promises
- Innershade
- Tales of the Deep Gardens
- Tower of Deception
- Unfinished Business

I'd avoid the very big mods like Check the Bodies or The Darkest Day

I would like to make the game more difficult. My plan is to include Sword Coast Stratgems I and II. Would you recommend against it? Would you add anything else?

On the other hand I would like to make inventory management in the game take less time

To enhance the graphics of the game

Anything else you would add or change? Any advice is welcome.

A lot of times when I make these posts people say it depends on what you like. Here are some pros/cons for BG1 that might give you some perspective. 




**Pros:**
-Great main story 

-Great characters (NPCs too)

-Occasional dark humor

-Not so much good gear that it feels useless

-Yay exploring!

-Yay multiple ways to approach combat!

-Yay strong bosses that require skill and strategy to kill!

-Yay party building




**Cons:**

-Lack of dialogue

-Occasionally boring and empty locations (arguably adds to exploration)

-Characters themselves actually have less dialogue than some NPCs

-Annoying undoable choices. (Granted dumping
Imoen'a dead body on a bridge wasn't the *best* idea.)

-I often have to reload several times to figure out how to beat an enemy

-Side Quests seem unimportant and short story-wise.

-Places like the Nashkel mines are annoying grinds to

Obviously the RPG style can't handle a completely random world a la Diablo I

* The game ships with a web of (let's just call it) 1000 partially linked sidequests, but each new game only loads some 300 of them.  A canonical subset of sidequests could be designated and selected with a checkbox at game creation for a repeatable experience.

* Weapons/items are randomly scattered amongst enemies as loot the way scrolls currently are (feels good to get a Mislead scroll off a slaver in chapter 2).

* Wilderness ambushes are partially randomized

* Traps are partially randomized to keep thieves detecting traps in dungeons.

* Clues could be left throughout the game to suggest where a certain mythical robe could be.  e.g.  in a civilian's diary: ""The Lord of the Windspear Hills wore a new robe at the tavern today... and cast his usual spell at the service bell without taking any time to say the incantation!""  Now you can expect the Robe of Vecna on Firkragg's body.

* Locks and loot are randomized in places like inns to reflect actual travelers coming and going.

I'm **not** saying the game should be entirely randomized.  I just want your opinion on what degree of randomness should the next BG incorporate, please make suggestions I missed where you would like to see randomness implemented.

Once we've got times sorted, as in my experience this always leads to more immersive and cohesive storytelling.

A couple of personal no-nos I hope we can agree on:

No good or neutrally aligned drow (dark elves). I think we can all agree the Realms have enough of those already.

No good aligned duergar

Try to avoid (like the plague) making a ""snowflake"" character. For those unfamiliar with RP terminology, and generally reflects a player's immaturity and inability to play a character by the book. The reason for this is, when every character in a party is an abberation (drow paladin, half-dragon half-ogre sorcerer, two-thirds vampire barbarian, etc) then suspension of disbelief suffers. No one can believe these ridiculous people all got together in the same time and place and decided to work together. When the backdrop of the story is generally cohesive and fits a certain tone and style, crazy characters like this will tend to stick out and break immersion. This is not to say that interesting characters aren't welcome - quite the opposite! - but there is a difference between interesting and stupid and I just wanted to point it out ahead of time so no feelings get hurt.

Let's say that I want a Fighter / Cleric character.
Starting as a fighter seems like the way to go (weapon specialization) and then dual-class switching to Cleric.

Many ""perfect party"" posts suggest dual-class switching characters at 9th level, will that Thac0 advancement even matter when the character is a 20+ level Cleric?  Sure, the specialization is nice, but 9 levels of Fighter is less important if you can't actually connect with high-end baddies.

Is Multiclass better at higher levels?  
17th level Cleric AND 17th level Fighter in 1 character slot seems good.

Am I over-thinking this?  Opinions?

1355248130.0,14oafg,Without cheese how few members do I need in my party to finish BGEE?,SpongeBazSquirtPants,9,2,27,"Ok

I solo'd basically every area until after Nashkel mines (chapter 3?) but soon found that I needed a thief to complete Durlag's Tower so left that for later. I had initially planned on going back to The Friendly Arms Inn and picking up Jaheira and Khalid but as I'd finished the Mines they were no longer there. Instead I ran into Neera there (I'd already met her in Beregost (I think?)) so picked her up for the group as I'd never used a Wild Mage before and thought it would be fun (it is).

A bit more cheese was eaten when I googled the characters to decide who to pick up. I decided on Coran and Branwen but first had to get the crazy female Druid from Cloakwood so I could go back to the Carnival to un-petrify Branwen. 

As it stands my party is the protagonist on point as main damage dealer (19 str, Neera throwing Reckless Deowomers everywhere and Branwen healing/buffing. I'm thinking that this might be enough to finish the entire game but as it's been over 10 years since I played through BG1/TotSC vanilla I'm not sure if I have the bases covered. I could always go back for Minsc for an off-tank or hit up Yeslick for more buffs, healing and a bit of tanking. I've also toyed with the idea of off-tanking with Coran (I have him at -4 AC) but that would seem to be a waste of his great sniping abilities.

The reason why I don't like the idea of buying the D&amp;D Anthology Collection, so is there a point in getting into a really deep game when an upgrade is likely going to set me back to point a? Also, its likely I'll be playing the EE vanilla because like I said, its unlikely the mods will convert perfectly, and I assume a lot of these are final versions or aren't worked on anymore and have been abandoned so its not like I can expect working updates for all of the good ones. Lets be honest, its hardly the developers of BG:EE's job to fix the game so it works for third party mods and its likely a sacrifice to be made and just a blind hope that they can make a version better than what is already out there?

What say you? Should I get ready for the long wait or buy the Anthology and get stuck in? I'm also a bit of a completionist and perfectionist so I'd like to have them all rather than wait a year for BG2: EE and then Icewind Dale's and Planescape's,False,self,t5_2t07j,False,,,t3_wgjv3

Our first session is scheduled for **Tuesday, just look it up online if you're not sure. We should get together ~30 minutes beforehand to make a test run so we can bugfix and make sure our platforms are all compatible.

The current lineup (people who have confirmed this time) is:
_______

*Cyricist*, *limee64*, *NostalgiaSC*, and *spotlessline*.
_______

Sorry for the other people who either had scheduling conflicts or didn't respond. We can always set up a secondary game if there is enough interest, so PM myself or spotlessline if you're interested in that alternative.

Let's start talking character concepts! Feel free to post backstories and class ideas in this thread

Really looking forward to this

**EDIT2** Character concepts so far:

*NostalgiaSC* Human rogue/wizard aristocratic type

*Cyricist* Human cleric of Bane tyrannical asshole type

*spotlessline* Half-elf fighter/(ranger?) justicar type

We've got our tank roles filled, we'll still probably want to have a dedicated arcane caster (sorcerer?). We would still probably benefit from having another cleric to handle healing spells since our dreadmaster won't be able to spontaneously cast them, or being less conventional with a druid. Again, depending on how much rogue NostalgiaSC decides to take, we'll probably want a skill based sneak attack focused rogue to shore up that weakness. As far as I know, spotlessline's fighter is Dexterity-based, so we would still benefit from a Strength-based fighter type. I might play a bard if it looks like we need one, it would be nice for my character to have some roleplaying justification for knowing a lot about the Realms - so I don't have to feign ignorance all the time. Not set in stone

Very exciting!

Paladins aren't allowed in this party because we have an evil member already. Plus if we had a properly played paladin,,False,self,t5_2t07j,True,,True

I usually start my strategy with pausing right before she starts the conversation so I can start my summons (unfortunately she casts a spell right at the beginning which will kill all but the highest level summons)

My party consists of Me (an archer), Imoen (some good higher level mage spells), Aerie (my main spellcaster. The problem is, if I forget about her for too long, she usually gets cornered by drow), and Saverok.

I set the summons on the drow to keep them busy. Things start to go downhill when Sendai's sorcerer form casts time stop. The gate and meteor always serve to distract me

Then invisible fiery drow come. They pile up and are hard to kill. They end up splitting up my party and getting to Aerie and Imoen.

It usually ends with just me and Minsc left over

I've always felt a detachment from the characters you meet and join up with in BG just because I didn't design them. To me it feels wrong having one character you've made your own and having to band up with other npcs that have no correlation whatsoever to your designed character. It makes no difference if they live or die since there will be other characters that will adventure with you, I can see how the same idea may hold true if you become attached to one of the characters you meet, but as of yet that hasn't happened to me. The farthest I can get is to is when you get attacked at the Inn at the start of the game before I get too aggravated to play anymore.
