I have uploaded a large chunk of anime images I have collected over the past year or so. There are over 13, which are not wallpapers and are more general images, gifs and official scans. In total, there is about **16gb** worth of anime images that I have uploaded, and it isn't all I have. Most of the anime wallpapers I have gotten are from dumps and bundles, and there *will* be duplicates even though I have used a software to sort that out. 

Anyways, Mediafire, Minus, Imgur and Torrent. So without further-ado, here are the links:

*****
**Download Links**

* **Mediafire:** All parts are split up into ~200mb parts so there are quite a number of things to download. The parts are all separate so you don't need any software to join them up.

 [**Medifire Link**](http://www.mediafire.com/?w49fti6qyne9es5,ndr31jkmwwuh4d8,qt4h7n4bllho9e1,nkqu616agv6l611,8heeakvapxfnbyz,ss2ufj73sz2b897,83wcopizdhlvi33,41oqng4lnbea6lr,uu4ikstxfz5cr44,8if6u6qqn3jj111
                  


* **Mega:** All links are split up into 1000 images

 [**Mega Link**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!ex5xQDSA!SF4irFgTP_VHsr0TIFXERw)

* **Minus:** There are two different profiles; one has all the anime wallpapers and the other have all the other anime images since I would hit the 10gb upload limit. As of now

 [**Anime Wallpapers** (13

 [**Other Anime Images** (3

* **Imgur:** My Imgur folder is the least up to date
 [**Imgur Link**](http://frontalspy.imgur.com/)

* **Torrent:** If you want to download everything nice and easy

Quotes:

""You can run

""When Gotham is in ashes

""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.""-The Joker

""Some men aren't looking for anything logical, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."" 

""If you walk a mile in a man's shoes

""it's all part of the plan""

""A smile will get you far

""Deep into that darkness peering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.""

""You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs""- the joker

""Now comes the part where I relieve you, as my plastic surgeon always said: if you gotta go, go with a smile."" -The joker

""Do you want to know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. In... you see, I know your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?""- the joker

""Ever danced with the Devil by the pale moonlight?"" -the joker",self,t5_2u42n,1358281137.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaperdump/comments/16iz6w/request_can_somebody_make_an_album_of_deep/

* 71 Motivational Quotes [1280x1024]

* 390 Portraits / Art / Various [All&gt;1600x900]

My reasoning:

* Imgur is the subreddit's preferred image host and there is no trivial way to examine a gallery's resolutions without downloading the images one at a time.

* Reddit's search function is terrible
