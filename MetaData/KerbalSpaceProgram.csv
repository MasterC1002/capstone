Reddit is not the same as a forum. Threads and posts inside those threads are not ordered linearly and chronologically. Instead

If your question is something a lot of people have also been wondering there's a good chance they will upvote your question. **The cool thing about that is then lots of people see the question and the answer to something that's either important

Saying ""please don't upvote"" just undoes this. You're preventing other people from potentially seeing something useful

1. No one cares about other people getting karma for useful content
2. You're supposed to get karma for things the community likes or thinks are important.
3. You don't even get karma for self (text-only) posts anyway.

Disclaimer: I hope the above doesn't come off as question bashing, [there's the new /r/KerbalAcademy subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1jfkay/introducing_rkerbalacademy_a_place_for_indepth/). /r/KerbalAcademy is an awesome initiative and I'd recommend it to anyone that likes helping others out with their rocket science or who has lots of questions to ask.","10,000 ships rapidly disassemble when you say ""don't upvote"" ",False,self,t5_2smr1,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1jmr3s/psa_please_dont_upvote_or_defeating_the_point_of/

/r/KerbalSpaceProgram is terrific. The community is growing rapidly, 21 of the top 25 posts are from Imgur.** It represents a growing trend, and nothing against them, but we want a place that is more focused on the teaching and learning aspect.

I mean, you could spend your free time on other finished video games winning achievements to gloat to your friends about, but instead you spend countless hours devoted to trying to solve a problem in a unique way, with really no reward other than to say ""Look what I did"" even if its only to yourself.  I am not sure if thats at all everyone, but thats what I do.

We've been following closely the ongoing debate about Expansion Packs and DLC on KSP

Above all

We realize there is more than one way to interpret that. Regardless of whether 'updates' implies 'expansions' or not

However

So given that this was a point of confusion, we are including Expansions in what you can expect to get for free if you have already bought the game. Also, for those considering purchasing the game, we will maintain this promise for all purchases made until the end of this month (April, 2013).

We have to admit though

But as you can imagine, but didn't really fit the original scope of the game. Those would have led us astray from our vision of the complete game, not to mention that they could take many months, if not years, to implement.

Those ideas are massive undertakings

So this is what we mean when we say Expansion Packs for KSP. We're not talking about small content bundles, or Colonization. Things that add not just content, but new gameplay possibilities. Things that might not fit the initial concept very well, but we think are too cool to just cut off forever.

Please keep in mind though, we'll see where we go next from there.

We hope that this clears away all of the confusion surrounding this topic

Above all else, we will be listening wholeheartedly to our community's feedback, concerns and ideas throughout this whole process and we will not slack off.

Here's a big thanks to everyone for all the continued support

Sincerely

What you guys are doing is not only for the creative minds, and complexity to let the new player mess around and have fun, but allow the experience to try their wildest idea to explore space.

I have only played the demo for an hour, it put a big smile in my face and seeing my successful re-entree made me even happier. 

I will be buying KSP once i have the money (i refused to pirate) and i am looking forward to countless hours of rocket building!

Thank you KSP developers to make such great game, and nudity. You have prove that video games can be smart and be useful as a learning tool. or atleast a tool to excite youngsters and boost their dreams to reach the universe in our small world.

So every morning and most evenings I build a rocket for him and let him launch it. He gets so excited about launching the rocket that his entire body shakes. He then points at it chatters and makes rocket noises as it launches. If the rocket is off balance he will go ""uhh ohh.. explode?"". But he loves it when they actually do explode. 

I have been teaching him how to separate and fire the stages too. But as soon as we begin the orbital maneuvers he gets bored and wanders off to play with his toys.

He is learning numbers this way. He has a little dart shooter happy meal toy. He holds it in the air and counts down""3..2..1.."" (and sometimes ""7..4..9"")

He does the same thing with shampoo bottles in the bath. Making them launch out of the water

[Resources flow chart](http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png) (Note: this version is out of date)

* [Thought previous version of system had way too many resource processing parts with overly specialized functions
 - A chemical plant that can process resources into liquid fuel/oxidizer
 - A workshop that can process resources into parts
 - More advanced parts will be heavier
* No distinction between solid/liquid/gas resources (e.g. water harvested from a pump
* Persistent resources (can be depleted) although they will last a very
* Resource locations randomly generated in each save
* Rovers on the ground will be much more useful for resource mapping than probes in orbit (Don't want it to work like ISA Mapsat where you just put a probe in orbit and time warp until you have a full map.  Wants the player to really work to get the map)

* Spaceplane cockpits will come later when spaceplanes get an art pass
* Might add a functional IVA docking camera

Career mode (want to begin implementation in 0.21)

* Will get a list of missions that “kerbal-kind” want to see you achieve
 - Will get contracts for future missions based on achievements
* Research and development tree
 - Branches can be unlocked via achievements/milestones (e.g. landing a probe on Duna)
* Persistent kerbonauts (may be able to execute certain missions on their own if experienced enough)
 - [Will need to keep alive with life support](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1bqbce/new_resource_part_from_nova/c99ck9i)
* Will eventually need to discover the planets (won’t automatically appear on the map view by default)
* Full rebuild of space center
 - Including mission control center

1374701468.0,1izfqn,Sub's Plane/SSTO Design for Beginners *Long Post*,subhumann,360,31,92,"Tired of watching your SSTO design backflip itself to destruction? Struggling with stability? Are you struggling just to get airbourne? **This is the guide for you.**

**There will be no inlet stacking

**Also

**BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FLIGHT**

Firstly

[Conventional Aircraft Model](http://i.imgur.com/Y777sF5.png)

Lets break this down.

**Thrust = Drag**

To maintain a steady velocity (we shall call this airspeed from now on). Our forward thrust must equal the drag on the aircraft. On earth, and AFAIK is a function of air density and aircraft weight. Lets keep it simple, **in KSP, your drag(for a given speed) will reduce as altitude increases**. This simplifies a lot of our design, but does add some other issues. So thrust is simple - We just need enough thrust to overcome our current drag. Fortunately for us, Jet's produce more thrust at higher speed, which is when we will experience more drag.

*Keep in mind, and our incipient drag is zero (wings will not produce lift in a vacuum, so therefore no drag is produced either)

**Wing Lift = Weight + tailplane force**

Imagine the aircraft as a seesaw. The centre of the seesaw is the Centre of Gravity, the CoG will move throughout the flight (as we use fuel for example), so the solution is to ensure the aircraft is being pushed up at a point **behind the CoG** . We call this point the Centre of Pressure (or lift). This is important. Doing this allows us to use a tailplane like a counterweight, producing a variable downwards force to keep our seesaw in balance. To make this effective, we place the tail back as far as possible, to give it a large moment.
**90% of stability issues are caused by incorrect mass and balancing. Remember that KSP will take fuel from the front and work backwards. Once the CoG is BEHIND the CoP your aircraft will become unstable.

**NOW LET'S BUILD SOME F@£?KING PLANES**

I here

[Simple KSP Aircraft](http://i.imgur.com/9GIrKxZ.jpg)

Look at the CoG positioning. It's well in front of the CoP, so we have put control surfaces on the wings, which we will call **ailerons** . These will **roll the aircraft** . These do not need to be large in KSP as the drag model doesn't model wing drag correctly.  And on the tail, the tailplane section which will produce our downwards tail force is called the **elevator** . This is to keep the aircraft at the correct angle of attack. We also put a vertical fin on there, to allow the aircraft to yaw and keep it directionally stable. We call this the **rudder**. One more important note:-

[Wheel Postioning](http://i.imgur.com/05CmSKt.jpg)

You notice how the main wheels are located behind the CoG? This is to make sure it stays on 3 wheels. However

ALSO lets talk **jet engines**.

Jet engines don't work quite like they do in kerbal. But suffice to say, we will look again at intakes.

The Avionics packaged is postioned on top by adding the small square strut and placing it on top of that. No hacks needed.

**NOW LETS FLY STUFF**

Your brave kerbal jumps in. First things first **enable precision control** . It's set as Caps Lock, I've trimmed nose UP by 1 ""tick"". This is how almost all my aircraft will fly.

[Runway Setup](http://i.imgur.com/mwjBKbA.jpg)

Punch it up to full, but give it a little help with some upwards pitch at about 70m/s.

If the aircraft won't fly level hands off. use the trim to set the pitch. In real flying, you have lots of extra thrust to play with, so just use the pitch to control height, and power to control speed.

To keep turns level

Too much bank:-
http://i.imgur.com/ZYneZSt.jpg

Not enough bank:- http://i.imgur.com/ukeD5Ul.jpg

Just right:-http://i.imgur.com/m7fDfNK.jpg

Go have fun

Sorted? Good. Landing is simple

**BUT SUBHUMANN

You will find the part selection is pushing towards a different type of aircraft design. **canards** .

**CANARD/DELTA WING DESIGN**

Canards work differently:-

[Basic Canard Principle](http://i.imgur.com/7Wfykzn.png)

The seesaw is different now, and also have some aerodynamic advantages beyond the scope of this guide. They are also more maneuverable, again for reasons beyond this guide.

So lets build a canard.

[Canard Design](http://i.imgur.com/QQubt7O.jpg)

Same principles as before, engine placement is easier.

**FLYING THE CANARD**

http://i.imgur.com/7964AtV.jpg

Different toilets

http://i.imgur.com/gixBorl.jpg

*Mandatory Top Gun comment here*

You will find the canard much more eager to turn in pitch, but I am not sure. Suffice to say you can pitch hard and I haven't managed to stall the canards yet.

**BUT SUBHUMANN

Why yes

**Non-Atmospheric Flight (SSTO)**

Now, you can climb higher on jets only. Less, you will need more rockets to finalise.

P.S - ensure your rockets are inline with your CoG. Otherwise you aircraft will pitch wildly

P.P.S **In space


EDIT: P.P.P.S **In 0.21

BEHOLD!

[SSTO KSP DESIGN](http://i.imgur.com/j0xTHlL.jpg)

Same idea

Now your probably asking ""Where is your canards?"". This is a Delta Wing design. We have increased our aileron size, and the pitching from the controls will balance our weight. This has the result of much larger pitch trim position.

Also

[Custom Action Setup](http://i.imgur.com/JoYXrw4.jpg)

This allows us to instantly light the rockets the moment the jets die

Now takeoff as normal

http://i.imgur.com/p8GGy5W.jpg

We will follow a profile like this:-

[SSTO Ascent Profile](http://i.imgur.com/jGvFl1t.png)

Get this dialed in your head

Once we get to 10000m+ Our inlet air will decrease

**Is your aircraft backflipping at this point?**

As your fuel burns, you can xfer fuel manually by Alt + clicking the fuel tanks in question. If this doesn't work, you need to go back to your design again.

[In-Flight Weight and Balance ](http://i.imgur.com/Dq4junS.jpg)

**Above 10km, so either use ASAS or untrim before this step.

Punch for your apoapsis:-

http://i.imgur.com/AUhI3oN.jpg

Then circularise as your conventional rockets do.

http://i.imgur.com/FF0eQRU.jpg

And there you have it! Successful SSTO launch.

[Greetings

 To Deorbit

Fire is pretty.

*I will admit, the lil kerbal survived*.

I start goofing around with little to no clue what I'm doing. My first rocket was a capsule directly on top of an SRB. With predictable results. So with some more puttering I learn about decouplers and parachutes and my second rocket doesn't go very far

Well I find out how to throttle a liquid engine and figure I'm going for it this time. Stack up a couple fuel tanks, with full thrust and some patience it gets about 20m in altitude, leans slightly and blows up against the gantry. Funny enough my command capsule winds up laying on top of the gantry with my Kerb alive. Net win. So I try out the radial decoupler and strap four SRB's to my rocket figuring that should get it's fat ass off the ground. It does, spectacularly, but then I figure I'll light my liquid fuel engine off before SRB sep so there's no delay. I wind up decoupling my SRB's while they're only half through with their burn, then go wild and smash into my rocket and... well lets say there was no body left to bury.

More experiments, but with more control surface and a gimballing engine you can really make a rocket tumble.

I find the SAS and read up on it. Things get better, four fins on my rocket, another one on each booster. It works, it flies straight... it won't turn and roll over. More rockets, more up and down, no flying into orbit. So I turn the ASAS off once I get some altitude. Pinwheel. Try again, tumbling pinwheel. Third time's a charm? Cartwheel with a half gainer. However I am learning

Finally, ASAS, RCS fuel tank, four RCS clusters (thanks snap-to-angle and symmetry buttons!), decoupler, short fuel tank, smallest engine, three long fuel tanks, two long fuel tanks, and watch as all three boosters pitch in towards the central core but  nothing explodes. Awesome! I clipped a fin on the gantry

I launch and things... this thing barely wants to go. Even at full throttle it's barely accelerating. I clear the gantry though and am gaining altitude so I figure I'm going for it. Boosters run out and I cut them loose. My main engine has a heck of a time pushing this huge stack but it still manages to keep me accelerating. I pass 50 kilometers and figure it's time to cut the ASAS loose and fly this thing. I pitch over and it goes ok. I manage to stabilize my flight path about 30 degrees above the horizon and figure I'll call that good enough. ASAS back on. I check the map, that's reentry. And my main cut out. So I dump the empty stage and push on with my small command module engine. It works. Pretty soon my periapsis is at 90km. Mind you my apoapsis is 2,880km but fuck it, that's an orbit. An ugly, seriously off angled orbit but orbit nonetheless. I figure I can circularize it though, or at least make it a little less awful looking and I focus on getting my CM oriented for a circularization burn at apoapsis. A little time warp and I'm there. I get ready to throttle up and...

I hit the spacebar.

I instantly understand what I've done and regret it as I watch my CM's service module with 1/2 it's fuel left and my main engine drift away. I've done it. I managed to put Bill Kerman into orbit then promptly stranded him there. I'm about to abort the flight in disgust when I spy the RCS thrusters on the side of my capsule. At this point what have I really got to lose? So I again fight to get the capsule reoriented learning to fly all over again

So I go through reentry, I established a stable orbit and got my Kerb back home alive. I look at my clock and realize I've been at this one launch for almost an hour and it's way late but of everything I've done today getting that minion look a like back on the ground alive was probably my proudest.

I immediately bought the damn game.

It is a pleasure to meet you all. My screen name is PD and I am the new Media Director at Squad. You can see the official posts on the facebook and twitter feeds along with the forums. At any rate I wanted to introduce myself to you guys. I'm typically not very big into the whole 'forum' type deal

I wanted to tell you guys how I got started at squad but we have to rewind to about 1 year ago. I started making YouTube videos and eventually bought and started recording KSP videos. I was recruited by former Community Manager DamionRayne to the volunteer KSP media group a few months later in the beginning of the fall season

Long story short my hard work and dedication to the game and company had not gone unnoticed and that led to me becoming the new Media Director and Ted becoming QA Lead. 

Just goes to show you that you can make dreams come true with enough hard work and dedication to what you love.

About one week ago I was offered the job I now currently have and that was right around the same time as my one year YouTube anniversary of making Kerbal Space Program videos. The day I was hired i released this little video. I'd really like to know what you think of it.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewe05BJcHfw

At any rate it is nice to meet you all here at the reddit community and I hope to be a more active part of this whole forum thing in the future.

**1) There is a quick save and quick load. F5 quicksaves

You can quick save when you are stopped on the ground,000 meters, even though it will say ""orbit"" before you get there.

**2) You can rearrange stages while in flight!**

I REALLY wish I had known this very obvious fact before I scrubbed a mission that was AT DUNA because I put my parachutes in the wrong order... you can move things around any time. It makes perfect sense that you can, now you do!

**3) Your Kerbals have jetpacks when they are on EVA. Push 'R' to toggle it on and off.**

I definitely killed a few kerbals early on by putting them on permanent orbit before learning this... 

**4) You can repack parachutes and fix broken rover wheels with your kerbals when they are on EVA if they are close enough to the object.**

Again

**5) Pushing G lowers all landing legs at once**

I definitely was right clicking all of them individually before learning this.

**6) Pushing U turns all lights on/off**

This one I actually figured out pretty early on

**7) You can select your intended docking port as your target to make docking easier if your station has multiple docking ports.**

Docking is still a PITA

**8) You can toggle through all nearby objects by pushing [ and ]**

This is how you send more than one kerbal on an EVA at at time. I knew you could do it

**9) You can clean up all your debris

Go to the tracking station at KSC

**10) You can lock stages by pressing ALT + L**

Yup

And there you have it! 10 things I wish I had known earlier on,,False,self,t5_2smr1,False,,True

So

Last week, which may or may not have been related to a global denial-of-service attack that affected thousands of sites last week. Whether or not that was actually the case for us is hard to tell, but in any case, the end result was that we ended up with a server so broken, it needed to be wiped out completely and reinstalled from scratch.

We keep regular backups of all our databases, the most recent snapshots we had for the Forums were partially corrupted or incomplete.

We've been able to get the Forums back up, in some cases reaching as far back as October. This means that unfortunately there's been some data loss, mainly affecting threads and most grievously, user accounts.

If your account dates from before October last year, there's a good chance it will be missing, in which case you'll have to re-create it.

Rest assured though, so your store profile is safe. This issue only affects forum accounts.

Regardless, there was nothing we could do to get all the data back. We're still working hard on getting everything we can salvage from the partial backups we have though, so we can bring back as much content as possible.

Needless to say, to make sure this never happens again. We are also adding in new security systems to minimize damage from attacks like that as much as possible.

Once again

Sincerely

What I've noticed since then is truly fantastic. I get a kick from learning a new thing, seeing the moment of realisation as something clicks in another person's head is a truly wonderful moment to watch. This subreddit is full of those moments. The comment threads and associated posts are areas of proud achievement, sudden realisation, and gleeful aspiration all rolled into one, and since the steam release, the achievements have just been getting more and more impressive.

I am seeing more landings on Jool's moons and proper bases on other planets than ever before

Watching so many people discover so much about the game has been truly wonderful for me, you have a better intuition for momentum than you did before, that various failed launches have exhibited the trade-off between power and efficiency, and that strapping more rockets on doesn't always make the thing go faster/further.

OK so many of you wouldn't be able to do the maths and get exact values, is interesting, and KSP makes it accessible to everyone.

Watching so many people develop their knowledge of how the world works (even if they didn't realise they were doing it) has made me really happy

1363835041.0,1apkcp,"Welcome, new Steam engineers, rocket jockeys, and Kerbonauts! Posted here: tips, tricks, and advice for newcomers!",91, tricks

1. When it comes to rockets

2. Getting to orbit is tricky, you want to being what we call your Gravity Turn; you start pitching slowly down the 90 degree line on your navball, holding it steady around 45 degrees. This helps you transfer upward momentum into sideways momentum, and keeps you from shooting straight up and straight back down. You head towards the 90 degree marker because it's the equatorial one, and is the most efficient way to fly!

3. If your rocket is wobbling, right click on each of the outside booster engines and select ""Lock Gimbal"" to avoid too much movement.

4. ASAS unit = The computer that allows you to press T and have the rocket keep it's heading. Only one of these is necessary on any rocket. SAS unit = A large gyroscope that lets you put torque into the rocket, because all command pods and probe bodies have something similar built in, which allows for turns in space without thrusters.

5. You'll see a ton of strange words get tossed around here; but not to worry! This community is amazing

delta-V = the change in velocity, to get to orbit, and another certain amount to get to another object in orbit. 

Asparagus staging = a way of configuring your rocket for maximum efficiency while launching. You connect your booster tanks in such a way as to drop them off symmetrically, because you are getting rid of unused weight, and the rest of the rocket is fully fuelled!

SSTO = Single Stage To Orbit. Usually used in reference to spaceplanes capable of taking off and getting to orbit without jettisoning anything along the way. These are crazy-difficult,False,self,t5_2smr1,1363837045.0,,,t3_1apkcp

Another trick not on the layout for the assembly buildings is ALT+left-click: copies the highlighted part. Can be used to duplicate entire sections/booster assemblies.

When you're doing your gravity turn

When building spaceplanes, but doesn't interfere with your maneuvers that much.

Also for spaceplanes

**Quick and dirty guide to Mun Orbit with pictures**

1. Launch and fly straight up to 10
2. Bring up the map and navball how I showed you eariler. Slowly tilt your rocket east (90 degrees on the navball) and keep an eye on your apoapsis. Once the apoapsisis is above 70
3. Choose your orbit height. I usually go for somewhere between 90-105km. 70km is the minimum.
4. Once you've got your apoapsis to your orbit height
5. Set up a manuver node that will take you to Mun. The best way to do this is to [have your apoapsis at ~11
6. Warp to the Mun. Right after entering its influence is a good time to adjust your orbit if you want
7. Once you're happy with your orbit angle and Mun periapsis
8. Congrats

EDIT: There have been a couple questions about maneuver nodes. To set one up, click and drag the circle with the pull-tabs on it around your trajectory. Keep your mouse in the circle as you drag it because if it turns red/orange, the node will be deleted.",,False,self,t5_2smr1,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1cqimr/tips_tricks_and_a_quick_and_dirty_guide_to_get_to/

* [Color is dependent on atmospheric composition](http://i.imgur.com/xky1shp.png)
* Added ""wobble"" to plasma trails; might add particle effects
* Added sound effects
* No actual heat in 0.19
 - Might add heat shields at that point

* [Long range directional scanner](http://i.imgur.com/9ivHBht.png) (requires you to manually aim at planet)
* [Short range omnidirectional scanner](http://i.imgur.com/3QEHQdc.jpg)
* Rovers on the ground will be much more useful for resource mapping than probes in orbit
 - Don't want it to work like ISA Mapsat where you just put a probe in orbit and time warp until you have a full map.  Wants the player to really work to get the map.

[Resources flow chart](http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png) (Note: this version is out of date)

* Other not-yet-revealed resources?
 - Kerbon = carbon analog
* Thought previous version of system had way too many resource processing parts with overly specialized functions
 - A chemical plant that can process resources into liquid fuel/oxidizer
 - A workshop that can process resources into parts
 - More advanced parts will be heavier
* No distinction between solid/liquid/gas resources (e.g. water harvested from a pump
* Resource system won’t be ready for 0.19

Career mode

* Achievements (e.g. landing a probe on Duna) will unlock bigger ""contracts"" for future missions and branches of the research &amp; development tree

Fixed lighting glitch where light would pass through planets

* [Now your ships will appear properly dark on the night side of planets](http://i.imgur.com/XNcQGE3.png)
* [Better sunrises/sunsets](http://i.imgur.com/ToIlQrl.png)

It was a revelation!  For weeks I've been admiring everyone's space stations and Apollo-style CSM/LM multi-stage ships... I watched several tutorials and tried time after time to successfully dock two of my ships but never had any success until last night.

I don't know what was different but suddenly it just worked.  First I linked up two of my small un-manned satellites.  Next up I had two brave Kerbals in MK1 command pods meet up in low orbit in a historic first...  Flash forward several hours and I've successfully assembled a pretty damn big orbital fueling station with 4 Rockomax jumbo tanks, tons of docking ports, solar panels, accent lighting, two auxiliary rockets w/ mun landers docked for future missions...the works.  It was a thing of beauty!

Satisfied after spending waaaay too many hours putting this thing together

That's when it happened...

I took one last admiring look at my work

I clicked ""End Flight"".

Flags flap. Flags drape. Flags must be seen from a distance. Under these circumstances

* **Use meaningful symbolism** - The flag's images, or sometimes even in the shapes or layout of the parts of the flag. Usually a single primary symbol is best - avoid those that are less likely to be representative or unique. Colours often identify.

* **Use 2-3 basic colours** - Limit the number of colours on the flag to three, green, black, yellow and white. They can range from dark to light. Occasionally other colours are also used, such as purple, grey and orange, but they are seldom needed in a good design. Separate dark colours with a light colour, that is

* **No lettering or seals** - Try to avoid the use writing of any kind or an organization's seal unless it is simple. Words defeat the purpose: Why not just write USA on a flag? A flag is a graphic symbol. Lettering is nearly impossible to read from a distance and hard to sew. Words are not reversible and this forces double or triple thickness fabric. Heavy flags do not fly as well nor do they last as long. Don't confuse a flag with a banner, they are seen from only one side, and they're usually seen closer-up. Seals were designed for placement on paper to be read at close range. Very few are effective on flags - too detailed. Better to use some element from the seal as a symbol. Some logos work; most don't.

* **Be distinctive or be related** - Avoid duplicating other flags, a flag's symbols, colours, and shapes can recall other flags - a powerful way to show heritage, solidarity, or connectedness. This requires knowledge of other flags.",,self,gilly,

1362235197.0,19iu7c,[Scenario Challenge] A meteor is headed for Kerbin. Can you stop it? Presenting: Kermageddon,SuperSeniorComicGuy,199,15,36,"Several days ago


Computer simulations have given us the following images: http://imgur.com/a/f2itN

How you choose to stop the impact is up to you:

* Easy: Blast it out of the sky! Success is defined by the destruction of the center x16 fuel tank.

* Medium: Redirect it to crash into the Mun instead!  

* Hard: Capture it and return it safely in one piece to the KSC so our scientists can study it.


Millions of Kerbals are counting on you. Good luck.


Now

1. Follow this ink and download the ""Kermageddon.sfs"" text file here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/plhlll1fonye54s/Kermageddon.sfs?m

2. Copy the Kermageddon.sfs file into your &lt;KSP&gt;/saves/scenarios folder

3. Start KSP and load the scenario.

4. Optional - Quit or ALT-TAB out of KSP

5. Stop that meteor!

Most of the normal [Weekly Challenge] rules apply if you want official Bragging Rights™: 

* No Dirty Cheating Alpacas (no debug menu)!

* Stock parts only

* No MechJeb or other plugins allowed

Required screenshots:

* Initial launch craft

* Orbital view of intercept trajectory with Kerpophis Meteor

* Close-up view of both craft coming together or capture

* (Easy) Results of collision

* (Medium &amp; Hard) Orbital view or new trajectory towards Mun or Kerbin

* (Hard) Safe return to KSC

* Whatever else you feel like!

FAQ:

Q: I want to try again. Can I restart?

A: Yes, copy the ""Kermageddon.sfs"" file and paste it into the &lt;KSP&gt;/saves/scenarios/Kermageddon folder. Delete the existing ""persistent.sfs"" and rename the new file you just pasted in there ""persistent.sfs"". This way is much better that hitting ""Restart"" because it is less error prone.

Q: I just accelerated time and the meteor flew right past Kerbin. What gives?

A: The meteor and Kerbin are on rails and literally flew through each other. Save your craft


Q: Can I launch multiple ships?

A: As many as you like. Just remember that the clock is ticking.

Edit: Formatting.

Edit 2: It seems reasonable to be able to practice a bit before trying to save the planet. If you feel like testing your designs

Edit 3: Changes to ""How to restart"" question. No chance of losing craft now! Also

Edit 4: I'm hoping there are a lot of people still working on this challenge. I'm sure that we would all enjoy some progress pics showing the spacecraft or how close you all are getting. I'm sure that others can then help improve the design or burn strategies. Together

Edit 5: Hint: Use multiple craft. One probably can't alter its course, so break up the tasks. Divide and conquer. ",,False,self,t5_2smr1,1362590467.0,jet,

I see a lot of people in the comments of this subreddit or in various other subreddits where KSP is mentioned talking about how ""I can't even do -this-"" and things of this nature

I guess it first must be noted that yeah, and probably always will so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.

I think people need to realize that this game has *way* more to do with how well you're flying the ship versus how good the ship you're flying. What I mean by this is that it is far more important to have a fundamental understanding of the game's mechanics

For example, just that you're going about it wrong. Once you get the ideas of gravity turns, throttle control to avoid drag, and maneuvers down, just to name a few, getting into orbit will be easy as pie, whether or not you're flying a junker.

This same principle applies when getting to a moon
