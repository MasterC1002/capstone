Now, I do have my own theory which to me seems pretty solid that I haven't seen anywhere else. Why I believe Chell will not make an appearance in Portal 3 (If it's ever made, I'm sure we're all aware of Valve's inability to make a trilogy). And if she does make an appearance, she will be sick and dying.

As we all should know, got into a lot of debt. The last thing his scientists made, however, was conversion gel, with one of the primary ingredients being ground-up moon rocks. These moon-rocks ultimately led to the demise of Johnson, leaving him terminally ill.

&gt; And guess what

What nobody considers is that Chell practically bathes in the conversion gel while in the test chambers. People may argue that players can avoid being smothered in it during gameplay, not just a coincidence. I find it hard to believe that Valve didn't know what they were doing when they designed it.

I'm pretty much pointing out the obvious here

&gt; The best solution to a problem is usually the easiest. And I'll be honest

This is why I believe that Chell won't be making a return in the Portal Universe - unless the clever individuals at Valve make Chell's illness and her need to seek out a cure a plot point that drives her back into the facility to seek GLaDOS's help.. Or there's some sort of prequel/flashback part of the game.

I've read many, and while we have been presented a lot of evidence, few things are certain. I'm not trying to pass of any of my ideas as fact. With that said, I believe that Chell was abandoned by her biological parents, Cave Johnson and Caroline, and adopted by the Ratman (Doug Hopper). Oh, and Doug's on the moon. Stay with me here. 


First off


Secondly, you are adopted and that's terrible."" She has no reason to lie here. Earlier in the game, she also says ""Science has now validated your mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep."" She later says ""If it makes you feel any better, they abandoned you at birth,"" of course referring to Chell's parents.


It is clear that Cave and Caroline had a very close relationship. For one thing,"" and makes it clear that she should inherit his entire life project (Aperture Science) once he dies. It is very, very possible that he and Caroline had a typical 50s secretary-boss relationship, and ended up creating Chell. Abandoning her is the only logical thing that Cave/Caroline would have done in this situation. There are a few lines that were removed from the game that are VERY suggestive of their relationship. (http://soundcloud.com/michael-34-2/caroline-dialog-portal-2/s-oNCX1). While these lines were not used and therefore are not canon, it shows that the idea of Cave and Caroline being together was around at least long enough for the lines to be recorded.


So we know that Caroline is Chell's mother, Cave was dead and Caroline was dead/put into GLaDOS. We also know that Chell was present on that day (http://i54.tinypic.com/x6fkpk.jpg) and at least old enough to create a potato battery. Her science project also gives credit to her father's work, implying that her father at the time worked for Aperture.


This means that whoever Caroline/Cave gave Chell to worked for Aperture. This is where the Ratman (His name is Doug, why would they make a point of hiding her last name? He also goes back into the lab and risks his life to save Chell even after she kills GLaDOS, claiming that ""It's my fault she's down there."" (http://www.thinkwithportals.com/comic/#15). This line could be several things. It could simply mean that he put her name on the top of the list. Or that he feels responsible for GLaDOS. Or that he was the one who brought her to Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. (http://www.thinkwithportals.com/comic/#15)


(It's very possible that he is not the adoptive father


So where is he now? That's simple! He's on the moon. Take a look at these murals


http://i53.tinypic.com/28qpvub.jpg
A group of seven scientists standing around GLaDOS.


http://i54.tinypic.com/3499fsj.jpg

Here we see a depiction of Chell and GLaDOS's relationship in Portal 1

http://i51.tinypic.com/2m2i7er.jpg
The phases of the moon once more. 


Clearly, he's alive. The achievement ""Final Transmission"" is unlocked when you bring a radio into a den (the one with ""smooth jazz fails"") and it begins playing sounds similar to those in post-patch Portal 1. These sound files can be converted into images, as discovered in the ARG.


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iV7Gg7COJA
Doug's final transmission was a picture of him on the surface of the moon, Wheatley has heard from his robot pals that a male human killed GLaDOS and escaped.
