Five laps were left and he was leading trying to pass a lap car and got into a pretty nasty wreck. He was taken by ambulance immediately. Within minutes a helicopter was spotted overhead headed for the Oskaloosa hospital. 

After the races I received a ride out with a member of the sherifs posse on a four wheeler and he told us that the helicopter was Life Flight coming to pick up Tony. The race just finished. It does not look like this has been reported anywhere as of yet. 

Edit :This just came out of the Des Moines register news paper.

This past weekend I made the trip up from Ft Stewart to NC to visit my mom and other family. My mom has been a Dale JR fan since he started racing in Nascar

Well yesterday , and she busts her ass every day, one of the hardest working people I've ever met. She is changing a battery for someone, and it turns out to be the Pilot for Dale Jr. He calls Dale JR and he actually talks to my mom and thanks her for continuing to be a fan of his even though he has went through his winless drought.

That is above the call of duty for any athlete IMO, but JR has earned my complete respect, and there it's pretty impossible to dis like the guy. ",,False,,t5_2qs08,,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/vc29l/good_guy_jr/

I got in to NASCAR right around the year 2002. All because of a hat. It was a DuPont hat with the rainbow tornadoes on it. I thought that thi was so cool. I immediately started to watch NASCAR and grew to be a huge Jeff Gordon fan. I've never seen him win a championship. I've ever seen him win 13 times in a single season. But I will tell you hat since he 2002 Daytona 500
Every week I would look forward to Friday to watch Jeff qualify. Then Saturday to watch him practice. Then Sunday to watch the race. It was the highlight of my week. And it still is. I'm 17 now and I look forward to every single race just for the hope of that chance that Jeff could win. Lately it has become rare. All I can do is hear about the 13 and 10 wins in 97 and 98. Hear about the championships in 95, and 01.  I know that it might sound unreasonable because he has won around 30 races between 2002 and now but it's nothing compared to the 48 from 95-98. As slim as a chance as it may be I hope to god he wins at least 1 more championship. But thank you Jeff for giving me something to look forward to every week or 11 years. I don't know what I'll do when you're gone. But thank you.",,False,,t5_2qs08,False,24b,

First, TX with general admission seating on the grass.  This past weekend I was offered a package deal through work which had me in the Roberts tower along with the Sprint FanZone.  So, better accommodations at Daytona, although I only was at the track on race day.  Also, I have no idea what the fan experience for F1 is like outside of CotA so my comparisons might be off depending on where you live.

**The Good**

* NASCAR knows how to keep their fans engaged.  I've never attended a sporting event where you could get this close to the people and the machines that make it happen.  From viewer voting, the ability to stand next to the cars as they go through scrutineering (not sure what NASCAR calls this, the inspection before the race), to walking along pit row and the rest of the track, everything is setup so a few hundred thousand people all have the chance to feel like they're a part of the action.  F1 is terrible at this - all the teams, drivers, cars, and even if you drop a few thousand you're still unlikely to get anywhere near the cars or drivers or teams themselves (based on my experience at CotA).  NASCAR understands that marketing to the ""everyman"" is their bread and butter

* The price.  F1 is just exploitative in their pricing of literally everything.  The least expensive shirt on sale in November was a normal color printed T-shirt for $120.  Prices went up from there.  Tickets are ridiculously priced

* I know they've had 55 years to figure this out, vending, ushers, police, etc.  Everyone I encountered was polite and professional.  Getting a few hundred thousand drunk NASCAR fans safely into and out of the raceway is a monster organizing task which they handled well.

* THE SOUND!  Holy crap the thunder from 40 of these cars roaring past you is something you just can't describe without being there.  As a fan of anything with a go-fast button

* These cars are durable!  Being an F1 fan (and a fan of exploding jet dryers) I was rooting for Juan Pablo Montoya.  I was pretty sad to see him taken out early in the race, taping shit back together, or just plain racing without half the body panels.  This is awesome, and it makes the race so much more fun.

* I had a lot of suggestions to pick up a scanner and I'm very glad I did.  I rented the FanVision thing which was not as useful as I would have hoped apart from the scanner portion.  Being able to listen to the teams and track officials was a *huge* help in understanding what was happening on the track.  F1 teams use encrypted coms to prevent other teams from listening in.  NASCAR wins huge points on this and I wouldn't even consider going to a race without a scanner now.

**The not-as-good**

* The NASCAR marketing goes a little overboard with the fan engagement bordering on pandering.  NASCAR has a long heritage of racing stock cars 50 years ago, but they refuse to admit it.  They keep making mention of the history of ""race on Sunday, showroom on Monday"", but that's absurdly and obviously not true any longer and hasn't been for decades.  Stock series like Ferrari Challenge and the various touring car or LeMans series use actual stock cars, race prepped for safety.  That's a stock car.  NASCAR cars are fucking amazing, race-tuned thoroughbred monsters!  There's not a single part there that you could find on a dealer lot, and as far as I'm concerned, but watching a real Chevy SS race for 500 miles wouldn't be anywhere near as exciting as the machines I witnessed this weekend.  It seems like NASCAR is afraid to share the technology under the hood with the fans in order to keep with their mythology of racing factory cars back in the 50s and 60s.  I think it does a discredit to the fans and is bordering on dishonest.  The cars are amazing - flaunt it!

* Most of the race progressed like an F1 race when it comes to passing.  I know this is a result of the high banked super speedway type track, turning, etc - meaning, they're out there driving their asses off just to keep in position.  In NASCAR, it really feels like the majority of the race is sitting on the bumper of the car in front and waiting a few dozen laps for a yellow flag or something to happen so you might be able to grab a few positions through pit strategy.  NASCAR fans continually complain about how boring F1 races are - have they even watched 90% of a NASCAR race?  It's even worse - they aren't even shifting or braking, and they certainly aren't passing.  This was, hands down

**Some additional thoughts**

* Danica Patrick is a fucking amazing driver and her gender doesn't even enter into it.  After JPM got knocked out I changed the scanner over to her channel and didn't change it for the rest of the race.  Her interaction with her team was the most civilized, but outside of all of that, she's just a damn amazing driver and I expect much of her as she begins her NASCAR career.  If I'm rooting for anybody at this point, it's Danica, and she's earned it.

VP of Fox sports contacted me a couple days ago to ask for my contact info and where I lived. He said they were trying to put something together to send my Family to the All Start race this weekend.

I think the fact that I live just about as far away as you can get from NC (California) kinda put a damper on that happening. I haven't heard back since Monday.

***The Basics***

**Yellow Flag (Caution):** Indication of an incident or debris on the track. No passing under yellow flag conditions. Pit roads are generally closed directly after a caution until the field is set

**Black Flag:** When someone is black flagged they have 5 laps to pit. Drivers get black flagged for either breaking a rule or having car problems that affect the track / safety / flow of the race. See this video of Jimmie Johnson being black flagged for jumping the restart: [Example](http://youtu.be/rhJnBWp1-lQ)

**Red Flag:** The race is stopped, there is highly flammable jet fuel on the race track that needs to be cleaned, thus the cars are parked until cleanup is done. [Example](http://youtu.be/BtJ25vXnIMM)

**Pit Stops:** Short maintenance stop to allow repairs / new tires / fuel for a car to continue the race. A great explanation of a pit stop: [Example](http://youtu.be/gzbhpHfqJiI)

**Drafting:** I'll give you the short of drafting. Imagine you're driving on the interstate, which usually means you're not using as much throttle. This sometimes allows for fuel conservation, and is a viable strategy. Also, under the same power load you may be a MPH or two faster than the vehicle in front of you, so the draft is used for getting a small speed boost to pass a vehicle. In this video, watch the M&amp;M car: [Example](http://youtu.be/80th39DyurA)

**Loose:** Ever heard of drifting? Fishtailling? That's the definition of being loose. The rear tires are losing traction and are sliding out of control. Also called ""oversteer."" Watch the yellow car in this video

**Tight:** The exact opposite of ""loose"" obviously. The front tires are not getting enough grip

**Restrictor Plate:** This is a plate that is installed in the engine, thus limiting the performance of the vehicle to what Nascar deems as a ""safe speed."" A side effect of this is that the racing is usually very close and the performance gap is bridged. It is at restrictor plate races that underdog wins usually happen. Anyone who knows nascar knows what im about to post... [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brGT0eVao2A&amp;feature=youtu.be) [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35n20PrJRk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Roof Flaps:** Ok, as when a car is going backwards there is very little natural downforce. Video of a crash before roof flaps: [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLdvjpFYcIs&amp;feature=youtu.be) Now in this video, the roof flaps engaged which prevented the car from getting further airborne: [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vTdpEvrZ7U&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Lucky dog:** When a yellow flag waves, doesn't it? So why do it? It's two-fold:

There was a safety issue for years, but driving right next to the leaders at the time, they could attempt to race the leaders back to the start/finish line--if they crossed before the leaders, they'd get a lap back. However, there would clearly be times where that race back to the finish line would go right past the wreck or debris that brought out the caution. So they stopped the racing back to the finish, but used the Lucky Dog as a way to still give the best running lap-down driver a lap back. The SECOND reason to do this has to do with situations when the first driver 1 lap or more down is running in the middle of the pack. There's a little less incentive to be competitive back there since they can't beat the leader to the start/finish line. Well, that driver might be around another driver who is a lap down. So now those two drivers can race each other to be the first driver a lap down so they can get the Lucky Dog if a caution comes out. So: it makes racing among the lap-down drivers more competitive.

**Wave around:** During a caution, he can get 1 lap back. He'll literally drive past the pace car and lap the track, and join the field in the back of the pack just before the green flag waves again. This is called the ""wave around"", or ""wave around lap"". The downside to this strategy move is that the driver using the wave around did not get the chance to refill on fuel or replace his old tires. This is a great idea if the wave around is taken on a caution that broke out within a few laps of another caution ended during which time the wave around driver DID pit.

**Competition caution:** A competition caution is a caution flag thrown out at a predetermined point in the race. For example, or a crash, it will serve as the competition caution. The purpose of the competition caution is to allow drivers and crews to make adjustments to their cars without sacrificing track position. Why do it? There will be race weekends where, for some reason or another (typically due to weather, however possibly due to very new mandated changes to the cars), the drivers will experience driving conditions during the race that they had not been able to practice for. Often times, these new conditions make it very difficult to set the cars up properly for the race. So the drivers race for a few laps, then the competition caution allows them to make the change without falling behind. During races that have a planned competition caution

Really

***Strategies***

**1. Short pitting**

This is a tactic where a driver/team will attempt to erase some or all of a gap by pitting before another car. The strategy is that Car 1 and 2 will be on old tires nearing their 'pit windows'. Generally, thereby erasing .5 seconds per lap of the difference on the track.

**2. Fuel Mileage**

Coming down to the end of a race, drive at partial throttle and even turn the engine off and roll during cautions.

**3. 2 Tires

Another strategy used to gain or maintain position on the track. In the pits, which saves 3-5 seconds, or just put gas in the car and save even more. The downside of this depends on the difference in lap times between new tires and old tires. At tracks like Charlotte, new tires can make the car 1-2 seconds per lap faster, while at tracks like Talladega, the difference is marginal.

**4. Rim-Riding** (Queue Larry McReynolds: Hes gawn to the HIGHSIDE!)

While the preferable racing line at most tracks is for the cars to be close to the wall on the straights, but since the radius of the turn is less, that car can achieve a higher speed through the corner and be at a higher speed exiting the corner, accelerating more down the straight. The goal of all strategies is to gain an advantage, and win the Race. Conveniently the best way to accomplish both of those (at all but 2 tracks - Daytona &amp; Talladega) is to be the car leading the field in 'clean air'. The Gen-6 cars punch a BIG hole in the air and the large spoilers on the back create a lot of turbulence. This 'dirty air' affects the aerodynamic efficiency of the cars and actually can reduce downforce. The leader doesnt have to deal with any of this, and has a distinct advantage.

Do You Think Race Car Drivers Are Athletes?


It’s a question loaded with debate and has been under the media spotlight ever since The Associated Press announced their 2009 Male Athlete of the year.  Five-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion

From my spot on the bench the answer to this question is an absolute
Let’s look at the facts (source: ESPN Sport Science)

•	During a 500 mile Sprint Cup race

•	A driver can lose up to 3.5 pints of sweat per hour.  That can be as much as 15 pounds of water weight during the course of the event. 

•	Driver’s heart rates have been recorded at a sustained 130 beats per minute for the entire duration of a race.  That’s over 30

•	Body core temperatures reach 101 degrees F


And we’ve only touched on the physical side of the debate.  A race car driver must be at the top of their game when it comes to reflexes, milliseconds is the difference between victory lane and a torn-up race car.

With the incredible forces exerted on a driver, agility, focus and reflexes required to maintain control of a car in excess of 200 miles per hour, it most certainly takes an ATHLETE to compete at this level.

NASCAR has made incredible strides in keeping the cars from going airborne. Roof flaps alone made a big difference and then you had the shark fin

So why did Kurt Busch flip over and land on top of Ryan Newman's car? Roof flaps are designed to prevent blowovers.  Before roof flaps were introduced

Kurt Busch was travelling around 200 MPH when his car was hit in the left rear quarterpanel. This caused his car to violently turn sideways. As the car turned, because this exact same scenario happens to passanger cars all the time. There really isn't anything that can be done about it, at least not that I could possible think of. 

If Ryan Newman got out of the car after [this crash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ8o38eK-KI) and said the same thing, he was probably going between 50-75 MPH. [Here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSA7HtDEXKA) of a V8 Supercar in a similar scenario as Kurt Busch, but at a much slower speed. Notice how quickly he turns over and how violently he flips.

*- Active prior to 1972 on a full-time basis

**- Currently a Full-Time Active driver

Firstly

I also did not include any active driver in the career length average as it skews the data slightly.

Using the data you can see that Earnhardt was the best driver of the modern era with 7 championships in 3 generations of car. Aside from that you can easily see the ""drivers of the generation"" take shape. Petty was clearly a Gen 2 driver, Waltrip collected all of his 84 victories in a Generation 3 car.

You can also see that you have some pretty large outliers. Bobby Allison won his first championship at the age of 45 and is the oldest in the modern era followed by Dale Jarrett at 42. Both drivers took a significant amount of time to win a championship as well in there 13th and 12th seasons respectively. Benny Parsons and Dale Earnhardt were the quickest champs winning in their 2nd seasons as a full-time driver. The youngest champ is Jeff Gordon at 23

In Part 2 I will be using this data to make predictions about current drivers and their probability of a championship before they retire. It will probably be posted tomorrow.",,t5_2qs08,1376577444.0,,42b,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/1kdakf/nascar_analytics_part_1_the_career_of_the_modern/

The logistics of doing that are hardcore, somebody loses money and exposure but some other track also gains those things.

***Car Adjustments***

There is only one adjustment a driver can make by him(her)self in the car, is made because the car is either too loose or too tight.

The most common adjustments made during a pit stop by the pit crew are: tire pressure, ""spring rubbers"", and tape on the grill...

**Tape on the grill:** the grill on a stock car is a very short and wide opening--it's NOT the decal that looks like a grill, the more front downforce (and therefore, more front tire grip) the car will have. So teams will try to keep the grill opening as small as possible while keeping the engine from overheating. There's only so far the grill opening can be widened, though: NASCAR dictates the maximum size of it.

**Tire pressure:** This adjustment is made before the driver pits, which would be announced as ""they're taking a quarter pound of air out of the left front tire"", for instance. That's another thing: tire pressure is adjusted individually so as to maximize grip. There are minimum tire pressures mandated by NASCAR, though, just like there are maximum grill sizes.

**Wedge:** This is an adjustment of how much force is applied to one of the rear springs. [HowStuffWorks](http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/jobs/nascar-wedge-adjustment2.htm) put it nicely: ""Compressing the spring of a left-rear wheel or **adding wedge** puts more of the car's weight on that corner. This adds pressure to that end of the car just like putting the paper wedge underneath the table leg. As with the table

The reverse happens if you reduce the tension on the left-rear wheel's spring or **subtract wedge**. In our analogy

The diagonally related weight between the left-rear and right-front wheels is referred to as cross-weight or simply wedge. It is often measured as a percentage of the vehicle's total weight. When more than 50 percent of the car's weight is on the left-rear and right-front wheels
Decreased wedge makes a car looser (oversteer) by making the weight supported by the front wheels in a turn more even

Decreased wedge allows a driver to enter a turn a bit faster

Increased wedge makes a car tighter (understeer) by making the weight supported by the REAR wheels more even in a turn

**Track bar:** The details of what a track bar is are a bit above me, but here's the short of it: the track bar adjusts the angle at which the sideways force of the car moving through the turn is applied to the rear tires. If you raise the track bar, the force is applied to a higher point on the rear tires, making the car more loose, and if the track bar is lowered, the force is applied to a lower point on the rear tires, making the car tighter.

**Spring rubbers:** these are literally blocks of rubber that get inserted between the coils of the springs. They could be inserted at any corner of the car, along with yet another thorough explanation I'll attempt to summarize for ya.](http://www.stockcarracing.com/techarticles/39758_what_are_spring_rubbers/) Adding a spring rubber will ""increase the spring rate"", e.g. make the spring stiffer. Teams often start with spring rubbers already in the rear springs, and will add a spring rubber to the right front (or left rear) to make the car tighter, or add a spring rubber to the left front (or right rear) to make it looser.

Curiously

***Technical Information***

**Drive Train:** NASCAR Sprint Cup 'Gen 6' cars (2013-present) are 3300 lbs (~1500kg), e.g. all but 2 races.)

The **engines** are somewhat 'old school' in design, as of 2012, fuel injected (with ECUs heavily regulated to be standardized across all cars). The fuel used is an 85% gasoline / 15% ethanol blend at 98 octane; the fuel cells are in the 'trunk' area and hold about 18 gallons. At the two 'superspeedways' (Daytona and Talladega) the engines are limited to 400-500hp by a 'restrictor plate' between the throttle body and intake manifold that restrict air intake. The size of these plates are determined by NASCAR, which aims for a top speed 'in the draft' right around 200mph. Teams are limited to one engine per weekend.

The engine is in the front, using a clutch pedal on the floor. The transmissions are set up to allow shifting without clutch use as needed. Other than the two road courses and (depending on driver/car) Pocono, races are run in 4th gear (mandated to be 1:1) with the exception of pitting and cautions, of course. The transmission connects to the rear end, where you'll find a very tough limited-slip differential in a bog standard solid axle housing. Teams are given a choice between two rear-end gear ratios for each given race weekend.

While the front **suspension** is double-wishbone

There is only one type of **tire** provided by Goodyear for any race weekend

**Data Acquisition/Car Adjustments:** There is no data from the car being sent to the crews during a race, using needle dials to indicate RPM, oil temp and pressure, and water temperature. As noted above, other than steering, braking, and acceleration the only adjustment that can be made inside the car is brake bias. During practices (and after the race) teams are allowed to pull data off the ECU.

**Pit Crews:** Pit crews in NASCAR consist of 6 men: front and rear tire changers, and the gas man. Crews may get permission from NASCAR to have an extra man 'over the wall' for windshield tear-offs. The pneumatic lug guns used by the tire changers typically operate in excess of 400psi. The gas man carries a ~90lb gravity-fed 'can' of fuel which is sufficient to fill the tank about ½ to 2/3 full; most 4 tire pit stops involve at least part of a second can. The crew may not go over the pit wall until the car is within 3 pit boxes of its own pit. Each car has its own crew chief, pit crew, and pit, which brings us to politics:

**Teams:** A given owner in NASCAR may own up to 4 cars. While not at the track, these drivers/crew chiefs/crews may consider themselves teammates, share information on car setups, work out of the same shops,etc. Once the race starts, each car is typically operated as a single entity. There's too much ego in NASCAR for team orders. The pre-race information sharing also extends beyond a given shop: e.g. Stewart-Haas racing buys car chassis and engines from Hendrick Motorsports and may share information back and forth on what setups work for the given track and tire combination. Or they may not ;)

1372812516.0,1hjaoe,Regarding the #3...,summertime1217,43,10,66,"A lot of people are saying that the #3 is Dale Earnhardt Sr.'s number. Granted

Reason #1: Drivers don't care about the sponsors and the numbers nearly as much as the fans do. I think it was Kasey Kahne who recently brought this up in an interview. Drivers can and usually do switch numbers at least once in their career. Look at Clint Bowyer from the 33 to the 15 or Matt Kenseth from the 17 to the 20. Neither seemed too torn up.

Reason #2: Most people ignore the fact that Richard Childress drove the 3 before Dale even thought about it. But when RC stopped racing

Reason #3: Dale's been dead over a decade. New generations of NASCAR fans are coming into the sport

Reason #4: Again

Reason #5: RC has said that the number is special

Reason #6: NASCAR wouldn't work if numbers were retired. It works in other sports because numbers are retired within individual teams. Someone plays the #19 for the Chargers doesn't mean the Raiders do. But NASCAR is universal, if you think about it, retiring Dale's number would be on par with retiring Richard Petty's number. Nobody talked about it in the short time before Petty put Andretti in it. 

Reason #7: A lot of people are mad about the colorization and stylized 3. Again, like the 3 on Harvick's b-post his rookie year.

I just think that it's time for the number 3 to make a comeback,False,,t5_2qs08,False,,29c,t3_1hjaoe

**Doc Brown from Back to the Future appears out of nowhere in his time machine/DeLorean. You are offered the opportunity to go back in time and compete in NASCAR in any ONE year from the history of the sport.  What year do you chose to race in and why?**

&gt; I would say


**r/NASCAR enjoyed your new ""Living Portrait of Dale Jr"" Mountain Dew commercial (it was amazing)

&gt; Thanks! It took about 2 to 3 hours. Everything was done on a green screen


**Were you able to get the jet dryer Juan Pablo Montoya destroyed at Daytona to add to your car graveyard?**

&gt; Yes we were able to get it. It's deep in the woods by request of Chip Ganassi. Pic: http://imgur.com/DmoxITg


**Who would you say is the most underrated driver out there?**

&gt; I don't know - I don't sit there and categorize or judge my competitors.


**1.  If you could pick ONE race to have a second chance at from this season

**2.  Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck

**3.  How often do fans try handing you ""the last bottle of Diet Dew"" to see if they can trade up for a race car?**

&gt; The Michigan race where we had engine problems. I wish we had the chance to run that race without any problems. I think we had a winning car.
It would be more to fight the horses because they'd be in the cute category. It would be like ""aw neat
All the time. Alllllll the time. They don't finish the joke though


**Whats the scariest moment you've had on the track?**

&gt; Any time your car gets upside down


**Last year Brad said he was interested in getting a tank

&gt; Brad's getting very close to purchasing his tank and I see that as happening very soon. I think that I'll just look at his tank and watch his tank ride around before I make any purchasing decisions.


**What is your favorite current and classic street legal car to drive?**

&gt; I have a '77 Oldsmobile Cutlass that I just got. We take it and make modifications to make it look like an old NASCAR stock car. Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/jVQIiuF


**Do you think the Gamecocks have a shot at the SEC/National championship this season?**

&gt; Absolutely. They've got a great team and a great coach.


**Do you think all professional racers are born with a lot of talent

&gt; I think you can learn it.


**Dale

&gt; Name it and I've seen it.


**What's your favorite kind of music for raceday?**

&gt; My favorite musician is Matthew Good - so any of his stuff.


**Who is your favorite comedian?**

&gt; Jim Gaffigan


**Do you really Love taste of Diet Dew?**

&gt; I love the taste of Diet Dew: http://imgur.com/3TPH8Uf


**As a fan I don't like G/W/C finishes and I have a tough time staying interested in a race after a mysterious caution comes out because of ""debris on the racetrack."" But I know a lot of fans really like having the G/W/C rule in place because it all but guarantees a green flag finish. And as a driver

&gt; I like G/W/C finishes but I wish there was only one shot at it instead of 3. And I absolutely despise debris cautions but we cant have anyone running over that stuff now can we?


**Someone asked Jimmie this a while back

&gt; Yes,False,,t5_2qs08,False,,z08,t3_1jtsva
