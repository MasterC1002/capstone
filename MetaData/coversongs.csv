Here is a list of some covers I have up:

Free Bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd
Montana - Zappa
Joe's garage - Zappa
Mirror Door - The Who
Wont Get Fooled Again - The Who
Wipe Out - The Ventures
Stone in Love - Journey
 - As well as many more.

I also have a few clippings from rehersals with my band as well as lots of live preformances.
