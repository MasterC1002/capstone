Soon enough

Yesterday night, but we got conflicting advice from another who said do 200mg then 50mg when we peak. We decided to go with the latter advice. 

10:30PM Both parachute 200mg of MDMA 

11:00PM Discussing the lack of effects

11:30PM Decide that it would be a bad idea to do the rest of the MDMA yet just in case we start feeling it very soon. Do it anyway (50mg). 

12:00PM Heaven; energy is flowing from my fingertips

12:30PM Introspective discussions ensue

01:00AM We both grab our iPods and select the same song, every strum is an auditory orgasm. I stood up because I NEEDED to dance, I felt like a string, a string belonging to a harp being plucked softly. My body just flowed like a river of silk. 

01:30 About 4 litres of water later and a very achy jaw

The rest of the night was just talking about philosophy and happiness. I got to sleep around 4:30AM which I was quite happy with. Although it did take a lot of focus and relaxation to steady my mind when my eyes were closed as to avoid nausea.

Hatred has completely disappeared from my life, and explain that it's not about how much money you have, or you SAT scores, it's about smiling and feeling love for everything. 

I love you all.

&gt;Harm reduction announcement:
&gt;
&gt;I'm working at the provincial toxicology lab, but this is the first one in about a year and a half. This might mean that a new batch of MDMA laced with PMMA has hit town.
&gt;
&gt;In case you're not familiar with PMMA: it's a molecule closely related to MDMA, and the effects are delayed compared to MDMA. Often what has happened in these fatalities is that somebody takes one or two pills, and doesn't get the expected effect, so takes more, and that's enough to push them over into the toxic range.
&gt;
&gt;The toxicity looks basically the same as an overdose of MDMA
&gt;-Fast heart beat
&gt;-Overheating
&gt;-Excessive sweating
&gt;-Shivering
&gt;-Headache
&gt;-Involuntary twitching of the legs
&gt;-Twitching of the eyeballs (here's an example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uck3zKhusRI)
&gt;-Confusion and agitation
&gt;
&gt;If you see someone who looks like they have these symptoms, and give them some water if they can still drink.
&gt;
&gt;It's important to mention that the recent deaths have been caused by PMMA _mixed_ with MDMA
&gt;

1342139124.0,wh0e5,Lovers of Molly beware - ,1hellofaday,53,5,9,"I had a horrible revelation today

I have been an occasional lover of E since around 1999. Typically lived by the self-appointed rules most of you seem to embrace: once a month, at least in my part of the US. A little over a year ago I was overjoyed to realize that the music I loved was back, but on a scale I would have never believed.  Quickly immersed myself in all of the fantastic new artists and genres that spoke to me, had a blast at every festival I could make it to, met many great new like-minded friends, and found my homegirl Molly again (she was around back in the day, but a very rare treat, but with restraint.

Everything going lovely since then, but it was a great time. Such a great time that I found myself doing things I never had before, like picking up more than enough for an evening, then going back to grab more for me and my buddies well before the night was out. I started making excuses to dose up. Instead of waiting for one of my favorite artist to come to town on a weekend, it was ""hey, I heard there's a great dub step night at this local joint"" on a Wednesday. Two times a week became three, became four. Picking up for myself what had once been more than enough for several of us.  Now, anyone in their right minds reading this will think ""what the hell, I would think ""wow, but suffice it to say that I am terribly disappointed in myself for some time of the things that have transpired over the last few weeks.  And then

For the last three nights I slept once, one last little taste, then I really need to get some rest.""  Drinking a beer this morning on the way to work instead of coffee so I could straighten up a bit.  And even then, wondering how I could possibly grab a bit more at eight o'clock on a Thursday morning.

The gears must have been turning, sobering up a bit at lunch today it struck me that something was seriously wrong with this. I had passed it all off to myself, with minimal effort, that this was just a silly little binge, they happen, and no doubt due to some of the drama going on in my life at the moment. But snippets of information I must have collected subconsciously over the years came together like a lightning strike. I quick hopped online and confirmed my growing fears.  Guess what: looks like I became a meth-head without even trying!

For those of you that don't have any reason to know this, but with the opposite emphasis. The results of which can be thinking you are getting a great, if a bit speedy, roll. You may notice that it lasts a bit longer, and is a bit more difficult to let go of than what you're used to, but it fooled the hell out of me, and I'm no stranger to entertaining substances.

So here's the meat and potatoes (finally, I prided myself on knowing the taste of MDMA on my tongue. This fooled me completely. Here's one of many references you can find with a quick google search detailing some of the differences between the two: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/498484-MDMA-vs-Meth-vs-Amphetamines. Testing kits are well worth the meager price. Wish I hadn't been such a procrastinating bastard and had picked one up like I had meant to forever.

What can I say? I'm mentally and physically exhausted, and still having to fight swinging by and grabbing one for the road on my way home.  I'm also indescribably thankful that I made the connection before things went past the point of no return (and they were heading there quickly).  I've never heard this story before, so if it helps even one of you fine people, or at least gives you some ammo for the future, then the hour and a half and three Delirium Tremens I spent writing it was well worth it.  I made this throwaway account for this post, but if anyone is in this or another similar situation that they need to talk about, I'd be happy to talk with you and offer whatever support I can.  Much respect to those who made it through this novel of a post

Tl;dr:  Enjoyed MDMA for over a decade responsibly

But from my experiences here's what I've seen been called ""Molly"":

* MDMA

* MDA

* Pressed ecstasy pills (they were cut mind you)
* Methylone
* 4-MEC
* Butylone
* MPA
* Research Chemical cocktail (not sure how else to explain it)

Here's what I've seen ""Molly"" cut with: 

* Meth

* Speed

* Piperazine
* Methylone
* PMA

I know alot of people either don't have money for a test kit or don't want the awkwardness of buying one but it's hard nowadays to ever be sure if it's pure mdma without one. I've seen plenty of rager/party kids that buy whatever they can get their hands on and take it without a second thought. 

But due to the high popularity of ""Molly"" and having majority of buyers accepting whatever's sold as ""Molly"" without a second thought

Testing product before you buy or buying in small amounts means you know what you're getting. If it's bad then you don't buy any or anymore. It's the best way to regulate it. Also


**TL;DR What I'm getting at is if you love MDMA, get a test kit. Just because someone says it's ""Molly"" doesn't mean it's MDMA.**

**The government isn't regulating and instead taking the stance similar to how they taught abstinence for sex (just don't have it). But drugs, and not sold something that can be inherently bad.**

Okay

This is how our day played out: drop our tab around 2 pm, and about 15-20 minutes later I feel something strange on the inside of my cheek.  I start probing it with my tongue, and it feels as if it is a flap of skin is hanging off the inside of my mouth.  I start getting kind of nervous, ""Did I really just chew on my cheek so hard that I ripped a chunk of skin off? I've heard stories of shit like this happening, oh fuck, oh fuck!"".  Finally after about 5 more minutes of probing, the piece comes off, and it ended up getting stuck to my cheek.

1371494285.0,1gj4xz,My girlfriend and I rolled together for the first time. The experience changed us. Is the change to stay?,loveandmdma,46,5,31,"About two months ago

A bit of background - we are together for almost 4 years, and not exagerrating we have found a heaven on earth in being together. I've never been so happy with anyone else in my life like I am with her.

Neither of us has ever tried MDMA before, how wonderful the touch is, etc., so we hoped to cuddle a lot, make love if possible (I stacked up on some Viagra pills to help me get it up, I learned that much from the Internet), and just enjoy each other. Yep. Two people that have no idea what they are doing, or even how long it is going to last.

This was the plan: We were visiting family in another country, we booked a room in a hotel on our way about 20 miles in, and we looked forward to have a blast there.

Of course even the best plans sometimes go to hell, then we were looking for a parking space for half an hour... so when we finally got to our room we were too tired for anything. We just undressed, jumped into bed, and were fast asleep in no time.

We woke up early in the morning (I think around 7am), so I figured that the 220mg of MDMA in a Mortal Combat pill should be just enough for me), and my girl took a half. We laid down again, cuddled a bit... but nothing has been happening. We had nice and sensual morning sex, then napped for maybe 15 minutes, then shrugged, told ourselves that the pill probably was fake, and left the hotel.

On my way to the car I felt for a moment a slight dizziness but decided that it was probably just the lack of breakfast. So we got in

Five minutes in, her heart is racing and she's really scared. She is afraid that it won't end well. We are now driving through a stretch of a motorway-ish road with nowhere to stop or turn. I suddenly start experiencing similar effects to her, so I slow down, try to focus on driving - but holding her hand at the same time. It's not so bad, I say to myself, it will pass in a moment. I open the windows, hoping for the wind to sober us up, every square inch of skin starts to tingle. For maybe 10 or 15 seconds I have the feeling of being outside of myself

She says that she needs to close her eyes and get hold of herself. Still scarred and dizzy. Two minutes pass and she says - OK

I've been feeling at least PRETTY DAMN GOOD for a few minutes by this moment, I just started laughing overwhelmed with joy. She joined me immediately. Oh my, how we laughed. My hand touching her hand felt like the best thing ever, like a nexus of love and sexual energy. The world seemed to be brighter, sounds louder and better defined. Laughing felt like orgasms. I had a boner pointed straight home.

We spend some time describing to each other how we feel, and it (he!) does it. She tells me that I drive very smooth now, like gliding. Not fast, very steady, in a way that is perfectly synchronized with the world, other drivers around us, and the flow of the traffic. I think I slow down with perfect understanding even before the braking lights on the car in front of us light up. Everything is smooth and perfect. We are going through London, red lights, smooth

We talk more. Different themes, happiness, togetherness. Now we are outside of the city and the plush vegetation of south-east starts to envelop us. And the really funky stuff begins. The trees... they're fuzzy! Plush, soft, like fluffy clouds or candy floss (cotton candy). The colors - so intense, that they seem unnatural. Like something from a fairytale, or from animated movie. Grass is rich, almost meaty. Everything seems to be breathing together with the wind, and it makes us laugh again and again - even that seems to be so sweet.

Finally, to the bedroom. Cuddling, kissing, french kissing, licking fingers - wow, what an amazing feeling. She put her tongue deep in my mouth, tickling my palate and it was one of the most amazing things I've ever felt. Did the same to her, but deep

Then we spend time quietly

Then we sleep.



Since then, trees, grass - even though it's lacking the amazing colors and cartoonish quality, is still... different. More rich, more intense. We both still see (or just notice) shapes, we wouldn't be aware of before our Extasy roll. Everything seems to be much more lush, we have started to notice and appreciate the beauty of the world around us. Literally, although it depends more on their texture and light. Ah

Us two - just the same. Feeling closer and more together than ever. Again, it's the best sex ever. We hold hands much more often, kiss with renewed passion, we are more open when talking about our desires, dreams or what troubles us. We know each other better, and we love each more even more. There is a whole new quality to life resulting in much more joy from the small things, like brushing teeth together, or just enjoying a movie.

So, or do we risk a disappointment? If we do try, what funny/nice/pleasant things should we try? I guess this time, if we do it, it will be less of a revelation, more of an exploratory experience... Share your thoughts :)

TL;DR - It's about beauty. It took quite a long time to write


EDIT: Hey guys, I got nowhere to stop. I slowed down, looking for a place to drive off the road. Then all the funky stuff with my body ceased, and it was pure mental bliss - and I admit, at this point I wasn't any good with critical thinking anymore. So I drove on. I had enough sense left in me to go slowly, leaving a plenty of space between me and the cars in front. I won't do anything that stupid ever again.",,self,,

I'm really sorry if this sort of thing is frowned upon but I had an epiphany that's altered my life when I rolled for the first time last night and I want to share it and say thanks. 

A bit of background for this story: me and my friends are seniors in high school. I hope that doesn't invalidate any of what I say because I feel that even though I am young and have a lot left to learn that this is a lesson ill take away for life. 

As I was dancing with two of my friends who were also rolling

As we danced there and talked, senior years ahead of us, with 4 limbs, a healthy brain, and people who love us. For fucks sake, we live in a first world country! People die for that opportunity. We've been caught up in our own worries for so long that we've never stopped to pause and just think about what we've been handed. And because we were rolling hard as hell, we got up and danced like morons just to celebrate that we could. We have whole lives ahead of us and that's something that not everyone can say.

My friends who've struggled with their various problems realize this too. I've never seen them so happy and I've been going fucking crazy trying to get them to here. Self esteem friend has never been so confident as he is post-roll. Suicide friend looks back on what sparked his depression now

Today I'm typing this on my iPhone from a cafe in a nearby city just watching the cars and people pass and I realize everything is beautiful. I've never felt like this, jump and think when some people live handicapped for life. 

Sorry r/MDMA for this rant. I don't know if this kind of post is considered bad around here because I don't frequent this subreddit. But thanks, I was rolling. HARD. But these are 100% sober thoughts and I pray ill never forget the lesson learned. 

To all of your health

It's Saturday and I got my pills, and very good. (This is in The Netherlands).  Even though my friend advice me to drop a quarter first, I just threw the whole thing in at 00:20, I don't remember much of my roll because of the repeated use of various pills through the weekend but I do know that I rolled very fucking hard from 00:20 to around 04:50 (dropped the second pill at 02:00). At something like 05:00AM I went to my friends house and did some hefty amount coke which got me right back on track.  
  
  
Decided to leave at 5:30 and my friend gave me 8 pills, not even rolling, everything seemed fake and every building had a 3D sort of outline on it (Was it even MDMA?).   
  
  
When I came home I dropped another half of a pill and decided it was enough,5 pills throughout the day and didn't even roll or anything, I didn't feel much of it, no comedown either, just normal, wen't to sleep after.  
  
  
Woke up at Monday and got another 4 pills, didn't feel anything for 1:30 hours, dropped the second one, started feeling warm after the second pill and then I decided to just drop the second two.  
  
  
Now lets describe what I felt from those 4 pills.  I was rolling, after I sobered up I just became a zombie not knowing what I'm doing and not knowing what to think. I would zone out every few minutes/hours for 3-4 seconds and it would feel like my brain just ""shut-off"" for those few seconds, I didn't pay attention to it.  
  
  
And now we are at Tuesday when fucking hell breaks loose. I feel my body and brain trying to tell me that they cannot handle this, I couldn't sleep at all. And today, I still zone out a lot, lose track of my memory and emotions, haven't lied down yet though, so I can't say for sure if the ringing and flashing thing is still there.  
  
  
Either way, **VERY, VERY FUCKING STUPID CUNT** for doing something like this, I think I'm going to stay off MDMA for my entire life if not a lot of fucking years from now, seems like I have given my brain enough shit and it's telling me that what I did is not something to joke about very well.

I would never replace those experiences for anything else, and of course they had an impact on my life. *But meditation + MDMA, is secret magic of unparalleled potential*.

How many MDMA users have ever tried to meditate while rolling? Just try it. 

Don't take my word for it, close your eyes, and pay attention to the lovely sensations pulsing through your body. **But, this is key: do this without growing attachment to the sensations, just observe them as they are**.

But sometimes the universe makes sure everything comes to place and gives you the chance of meeting MOLLY.

As it was very crowded 

It so happened that one of the best Trance Dj's ever DJ Astrix was playing right next to our shack. I was blown away on hearing this.
I have always wanted to see him  live.

My friends wanted to attend to but none of them wanted to do Molly. I was hell bent on trying it but was pretty scared to ask around.
(Universe starts playing it part again).

We went to another beach and one random person gave me a rave party flyer and asked me if i wanted to get some MDMA. I was like OMFG Yes. I got some MDMA.(Universe thank you)

Then i split it into 5 parts and did just 1 part. Close to about 30 mins in i was not feeling anything. Then i did a tiny bit more. 5 mins in I suddenly felt like there was spark inside me that was ignited. I felt liberated and a sudden wave of happiness hit me.

I felt like i turned Super Saiyan (Just love DBZ too much). I ran across the street and my frens had a hard time keeping up.

We reached the party and the music just got to me. It was still 30 mins for astrix to start .I was already dancing my ass off! A couple who were tripping next to me on LSD , I never realised getting beer poured on your head could be this amazing.I thanked them and hugged them.

Then astrix came on and i danced like there was no tomorrow. I was not trying to dance hard but i just could not stop. I looked up and the  world looked a happier place where every single person was to himself 

I had tears of joy. I hugged my frens. 

Astrix came down after the party and we got a pic with him. I just cant explain the feeling of hugging him and telling him Thank you.

These guys put everything they have to make us dance and its high time we respected every musician out there.

It was one of the best nights in my life .

Thank you molly and thank you universe!

1343339683.0,x7oyo,MDMA at a festival...musings,hank_kingsley,32,3,16,"I guess this is pretty self indulgent but I just want to share what happened to me this weekend. I guess at the very least I am getting these thoughts out of my head because I am a little bit lonely right now

I did MDMA with some friends at a festival. It was one of those 3 day music festivals where a looot of people are on it. I was kind of timid about taking it. I've done it

I came to some major realizations.
I was timid before taking it because I was cozy with my worldview.
But my view of people kept me lonely and isolated.
I would judge people. And think myself superior. And make social situations try to revolve around me like I was some sort of genius.
But when the going got tough, oh god this IS strong""...eyes rolling into the back of my head...things got very serious.

I was with a new friend that I had met a day before the festival.
He was so gentle and so kind
And he knew that things were getting serious for me.
And we just sat and watched the sunrise. It wasn't forced or anything but I spilled out all my fears to him.
It felt so good to let go of the guilt and the insecruity I have about myself.

I can be so god damn insecure. I hold myself away from others and I almost felt undeserving of love. These thoughts that I have...so unkind to myself. And it's hard because I could very clearly see that other people could see that I actively would degrade myself. And they would hold a silent pity for me almost...If only he knew.
And it hurts

But I sat there...it was a cold night. And I had no choice. Surrender. Surrender to the cold. To the promise of the sun coming up on the horizon. Just wait. Just hold on. Be strong. Be so strong boy

And I could see it.
Out of nowhere a kind dude came up and ran his fingers through my friends hair... a token of respect and admiration.
WOW I thought...people ARE so kind.
And I would judge before this! 
I can be so foolish!

My eyes were opened to the brotherhood of humanity.
I am so small without my fellow humans.
And I can think I am so smart and so knowing...I can be so selfish.

I was once told that the most important skill you can have is to have meaningful relationships with other people.

It was my 25th birthday just yesterday and I now realize I barely know how to sustain caring relationships with others. No wonder why people never invite me out. How much time have I actually spent...making memories with the people in my life? Why do I choose to be cooped up in my room and on the internet?

Tough questions. It was hard. Things got serious.

I owe myself a beautiful life. Enough feeling sorry.

I have so far to go. I think things will be better though.

I know other people have gone through this. In the end it is all beautiful. It is all good. I will try my hardest to always,,False,self,t5_2qwvg,1343340255.0,,True

What I gathered:

- Most pills were pressed at lab in Orange County CA
- Dealers and users didn't know the actual dosage of the pills
- They were unstamped white presses
- They were freely sold at local bars near the Starck. Some bar owners made more money selling mdma than booze.
- But you had to ask for it
- There were many celebrities who indulged.
- The pills were transported in large quantities via checked luggage. The guy I spoke to was only stopped once and then quickly let go.
- It spread to every major urban area quickly

So, then busts happened so quickly that all the players at the time quickly got out of the game.

Nobody got rich apparently. There just wasn't enough demand and the distribution was too provincial. 

Not surprisingly the quality turned to shit once it was made illegal and there were lots of adulterants appearing. Lots of people who really enjoyed it stopped completely because they worried about adulterants.

Reminds me a bit of the RC scene from years back.

I realise touching things feels amazing
I remember that I should be listening to music

I couldn't of timed it any better

 I hear the calming melody and it entrances me. Everything around me looks better. Everyone walking on the street looks friendly. My eyes darting from side to side felt amazing. The music itself felt like it was coming from the heavens, I realized this is why they call it Ecstasy

We took our doses around 8p in our home. Before hand just because we wanted to be careful we safety proofed our house a good bit. Cleaned up put all the breakables in safe places and such. We turned down the AC a little lower than normal (76 F) also probably unnecessary but just in case.
About 45 min later as she was working on a puzzle and I was watching a football game in the same room I said something to the extent of 'I wonder if we took enough' to which she says 'I feel like I always say that when I take shrooms right before they hit me'

She was right. about five min later I looked at her and her eyes were huge and she was starting to get tactile. She covered up the puzzle put it away and we snuggled on the couch together. With in a few min we were both hugely tactile and rolling on the couch moving on each other and feeling the sheet textures. 
We started talking and connecting on an unparamounted level. We started sharing our inner selves and did so for the next six hours almost continually.

After a bit (probably 2 hours after dose) we started to foll around. It was really great
At this point (2:30 ish after dose) for some reason I really forget we decided to take a shower together. RIGHT DECISION!!! I think it was the best physical experience of my life. We were sexual in the shower but the fact that we couldn't actually have sex did not bother ether of us. The feeling of hot water hitting my skin was amazing. Oddly I think my fav part was running my hands through her wet soapy hair. We stayed in the shower somewhere between 30-45 min.

After we turned on Planet Earth and snuggled/rolled/kissed/talked on the couch largely for the rest of the experience.
We went to sleep about six and a half hours after dose. Both she and I reported poor sleep quality and extremely heightened dream states.

After thoughts
Our connection deepened far more because of the joint experience than either of us thought would happen.
It would have been nice to have sex but certainly did not take away from it.
Shower was amazing.
Hangover wasn't to bad. I was just very tired the next day from lack of sleep.

Last night, as someone who has rolled numerous times, with everyone who is interested.  As it stands, defining *the* feeling (universal) is probably impossible, because individual aspects of it probably vary between users.  However, I think that if enough of us share descriptions of our own individual experiences with that feeling, we can come closer to a universal idea of it.

It all begins with a gentle warmth all over.  This is when I know my body is starting to take in the mollie.  After this the next things I start to feel are the physical effects of the drug.  I slowly become aware of the ""eye wiggle"" (nystagmus) and I notice that my jaw muscle is a bit overstimulated.  At this point

The roll can begin after the minor physical effects of the drug set in but at this point it requires your participation.  You cannot sit static and wait for something to happen to you. This is because the drug has primed your brain to give you manifold the normal quantities of serotonin and dopamine but the mechanisms that trigger these releases in your brain are the same as they are in your normal life and they still require an external trigger in order to function because the drug itself is not a trigger.

So, you get a lightshow etc...) what does the infamous ""roll"" actually feel like?  To me, it feels as though my body is a hollow vessel and it starts to fill from my feet with warm energy and emotion.  As it fills up, I feel it rise higher, past my stomach, past my chest, to my neck, pressure right behind my eyes.  It's not uncomfortable pressure though, I find a best friend who is coming up too and I hold them tight and tell them I love them to give them my energy, I sing the lyrics to my favorite songs with all my heart and look at the faces of the people around me who are singing too and we share a moment as I sing with them

I believe that many aspects of the roll are unique to the individual,,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,True

1359606982.0,17m0al,Trip report: my first experience with MDMA.,throwing303,26,7,14,"Trip Report:
Okay, purported to be “ecstasy”. I’m 23 now, and haven’t tried it since. I recently came upon a source that I trust to be accurate, safe, and reliable. He sells lab tested, MDMA at a reasonable price. I purchased 2.25 Grams in the form of 10, 225mg pressed pills. (+/- 5 mg). 

8:05 PM: 	I am home, marking my initial dose at 110 mg.

8:50 PM: 	I was anxiously awaiting the feeling

9:15 PM	I am in deep thought. This has been the hardest year of my adult life, and I can see that nobody is going to change my situation but me. Nobody is going to hand me something for nothing. My lack of motivation and amount of laziness I have disgusts me now. People move through setbacks, and successful people continue to fight on their road to success. I feel extremely motivated to “work harder” at getting to where I want to be.

9:40 PM	I decide I want more. I see the crushed and powdered half of a remaining pill

9:50 PM	I can clearly feel a sudden, and very intense, I am truly feeling “ecstatic” at this point. I turn on same dance music, and dance around my house feeling great. This track comes on, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugM4jL7qcIk     and I have to listen to it 6 or 7 times. This is seriously an amazing track. My jaw is really starting to clench up bad now, so I put a few sticks of gum in my mouth. MAN oh MAN did that gum feel great.  While the chewing of the gum itself was enjoyable for my jaw, it was the sensation of my tongue manipulating the gum that was so amazing. I don’t know how to describe it. The gum was so soft, it was very erotic. I certainly wish I had a female to have experienced this with

10:30 PM	This is where I should have stopped, one half shatters, the other is a clean break. I swallow the clean break half (3rd dose, 110 mg). I’m feeling very cold, I know I’m supposed to be hot and drink lots of fluids, but I’m freezing. I put on a coat. I sit and try to play some video games, but I can’t concentrate on them, and my pupils are enormous

11:40 PM	I decide to take my final dose. This dose was definitely overboard, 110 mg). 

12:30 AM	I’ve been dancing by myself for almost an hour. I decide to go rest on the bed, a kaleidoscope of colors, emotions, and thoughts runs through my brain. I reflect back on past lovers, and again reinforce my decision to bring myself out of the slump I’ve drug myself into. Seriously, I see it happening to so many people, and it’s happening to me to. You have to go out and get what you want, fucking angry at everybody

1:30  AM	Definitely coming down a little bit. Still rolling
	
2:30 AM	Token masturbation attempt. Unable to reach orgasm. I am infuriatingly horny

3:00 AM	I take a swig of Nyquil

9:00 AM	I wake up for work. Jaw still clenching pretty bad. I can still feel the effects of the mdma. I feel good, and refreshed.

1:00 PM	Jaw clenching has finally dissipated, and my brain feels a little “fried”. I’m having a hard time concentrating on tasks at work. I feel a little nauseous.

6:00 PM	These feelings subside too

Final thoughts: 	I had an amazing time. I had some revelations, and I fear that the negative effects weren’t harmful enough to keep me from likely binging on the remaining 8 pills I have over the next few weeks.

1) how long have you used for?

2) on average

3) what is your preferred dosage and your average dosage?

4) do you feel any diminished effects from mdma? Do you use supplements?

I'll share mine and maybe if there is enough data we can create some graphic for it or something

1) started December 2012

2) i have used about 10 times in 9 months so my average down time is a bit less than a month; there was a month where i used 4 times though

3) my preferred dosage is now 100mg but my average dosage is probably near 200

4) i feel that the effects are not as strong but that may be due to the lack of novelty and consistent setting (i have never rolled outside my home). Also I have lowered my preferred dose. I started supplementation for my last few rolls by using guidelines i found on this subreddit. as a result i no longer suffer bad comedowns. I understand that this may be a placebo effect or the result of slowing down my usage.

Clear out a safe space. If you're rolling *ballz*

Spin around in a circle

Slowly count out loud to twenty. (Can be fun to have someone count for you too.) 

If you're having trouble balancing, especially toward the end. 

Start with your arms stretched out, bring them in and fold them across your chest to increase your centrifugal force (careful with this). 

Now **stop.** Carefully lie down (even better if you have a soft mattress--grass outside is perfect but this is a bit suspicious-looking to do in a public area).

Really out of curiosity only since I've never heard anyone mention anything like this before and couldn't find anything via search.

I've taken MDMA on average once every 2 months since last summer. 

Every time I've rolled has been at show/festival. I still frequently go to shows sober as well, despite going completely sober. 

Then here and there, emotional mix and getting REALLY into it the music... and I started getting pretty intense eye wiggles and mild visual distortion (like I'm very slightly cross eyed) like I do when I roll on slightly higher doses (150mg, nothing insane). It was bad enough that I had to put on my sunglasses and close my eyes because I was starting to feel motion sick. I couldn't stop them until I turned the music off.

1331533981.0,qsliq,Last night... Ramblings :),herzig_Caroline,17,0,14,"Wow. I had an amazing night last night.

I met a kid right when I walked in, so he types it out on his phone, aww! He and I team up and I give him some kandi. He kept all the creeps away from me by acting as my boyfriend. He is beyond impressed with my only slightly-impressive dance moves. His smile doesn't fade all night.

I excuse myself to take my pills in the portipotties out back. Fourty-five minutes later I'm listening to some amazing prog. house/complextro and my vision gets blurry, is coursing through my whole body, up from the dirty floor into my legs and my heart and my eyes... I close my eyes and revel in a moment, it felt like time stretched on as the peak grew higher and higher... 

I felt a bit sick, and the feeling passed. Matt was sober but knew that I must have taken something. He rubbed my head, hugged me, and kept me in a nice head space. I was dancing my ass off and became a bit overwhelmed so we sat against the wall in the back of the room with other people. Traded more kandi with people we were sitting by... Just being able to sit and cuddle and talk to a new friend and listen to this amazing music... It was the best. 

We spent the rest of the night dancing, everyone is running on pure endorphins and dancing but you can tell everyone's winding down... but 4 am has to come and it comes time to part ways. Hug and say your goodbyes and hellos, leave the venue with a giant, abeit painful smile on your face. 

I started raving in October and I've managed to make it to atleast one rave a month since then. I've never been happier

The afterglow I experience from MDMA is something that I've come to love and look forward to. I've been blessed to never have a bad come down off of MDMA. I can look back in reflection and take all of the experience in. My outlook is very positive the week following. Just thinking about the vibes and the music and the people... Such a positive space. I can't wait to go ""home"" again soon.

we spend most of the day walking around, so it stayed nice and cool, around 80 with no sun, absolutely perfect. it got to be later and they opened up the main stage/lawn area. We're sitting in the lawn, listening to mastadon, bullshitting and just having a great day. 

We decided to head over to the bathrooms and fill our water bottles at the fountain. On our way we ended up running into an old friend from school and he informed me he had great molly caps at 10 bucks a piece. I was hesitant at first, called my buddy and asked him if he could come sit with us.


I asked him if it would make me hallucinate(I'm absolutely horrified of the thought). He informed me I would be in complete control of myself and my actions and at most I would see some tracers/bright colors. I was still unsure

We waited until the band before Five Finger Death Punch ended(can't remember who it was). We each opened our caps and dumped them in our mouths. It was seriously the most discussing thing I've ever tasted(And I used to snort heroin every day for 2+ years!).. We took it like champs though, almost scared of what was to come. Though they hadn't said anything about it, I could tell they were all excited for it to kick in.

It's been about 30 minutes and five finger death punch comes on stage and starts playing their song Salvation. We all stand up and start cheering, fireflies and the wind against trees. Everything is absolutely gorgeous. Five finger went through their set list and we all got bummed out when they got off stage. But we're rolling pretty hard right now. We sat back down, 2 of my friends are sitting a few feet away talking, me and another one of them are laying down touching the fuck out of the grass.

A few girls walked up to us and asked if we were rolling, I could barely contain my excitement for seeing Rob Zombie live again! I was burning through cigarettes faster than a hummer burns gas. I'm sweating like hell and I've never felt so alive in my life. I was so full of energy and every emotion I had was easily 10x more intense.

After a good hour and a half of Rob playing his music he leaves the stage and we all start rushing to the car. I'm still rolling, watched some tv and ate some Chinese food. I felt completely fine, 100% happy with how the night turned out.

I might be rambling a bit but I feel like this is important. My boyfriend has been introducing me to new experiences

Anyway, him, and a few of our friends have a pill and hang out in my house that evening. Now, I seriously considered asking Grace to join us, but she implied she had other plans at home. I did get the feeling that if I had asked, I could've convinced her to stay... but anyway, she went.

Anyway, and that I felt like we'd have a lot to talk about and all this.

She rang me after a while

Instead of talking to my confident friend (hair extensions, nice dresses, chats to everyone) I was just talking to this scared girl who had nobody to talk to.

I just couldn't believe that I'd never really ASKED her how she was doing - not just what she'd been up to. She was on the verge of tears at least two times during our conversation. It was like she'd just been waiting for SOMEBODY to take concern in what was actually going on in her head.

It was just so emotional

Also

We really broke ground last night and I can't believe that I knew so little about my ""best friend"".

She's starting a teaching position/course in September so she's just got to tide herself over until then. I think she did just have to tell somebody how she'd actually been feeling. So although she was talking about her sadness

So ANYWAY! I think sad people should talk to people on MDMA

To give an example, definitely high purity. Did it with some friends. They started their roll off with ~200mg each because they wanted a strong roll, I started with ~300mg. By the time it kicks in they're all rolling hard, I'm clearly feeling the stimulant effects but the ""happy"" just isn't quite there, I'm feeling it but not like them, they're clearly off their faces but I feel more like I'm a bit happier than normal but mostly like I've done a couple of bumps of amphetamine. In the past I've experimented with starting with as much as 500mg, at that point I seem to be able to get that almost delirious joy that others get at 200-250mg but the body load is pretty intense starting off at those doses…

Now, not on any medications, except for the odd bong hit or a few beers I don't use drugs more than 3-4 times per year, this weird tolerance issue has been with me since the first time I tried MDMA, a bit taller than average and in pretty good shape. Also, I can't say I have any similar tolerance issues with other substances.

For me, a sudden vision of dull clarity haunts the back of my mind, but I often forget about it and get sent right back up again.

So of course i was interested! We managed to get our hands on 1g of molly and thus the night started.

At around 9 we were informed by our dealer that he actually gave us 1.1g. So we eyeballed it into 6 piles and poured 2 into a water bottle. I trusted her, but maybe around 10 minutes later, i get tired again and tug her back onto the bed. She says she can feel it coming down and wants me to re-dose. Only 2 hours had passed. I still felt very happy, but not as energetic so I just went along with it. We drink down another 2 piles and turn up the music.

It hits me again, so i just close my eyes. We continue to share secrets and we make out so passionately. I never felt so confident and amazing. I tease her and talk to her as if I'd been dating her. I ask her to be my girlfriend for the night and she quickly says yes. We talk about the honeymoon period and how fucking great it feels, especially right now. We kiss and she's on top of me. We are in our boxers and i end up touching her down there. I ask if i can go down on her and she says no. It does'nt bother me at all. I ask her if she can be my real girlfriend when we sober up and we make multiple promises. 1.Not to be awkward when we sober up in the morning 2. To go on a date together 3. to never share the secrets we told each other. She then tells me that she's falling for me. We share more things and she tells me that i could be the most humble friend ever. We cry together, but it felt right. I tell her we should get to know each other perfect and she agrees. She compliments me on everything, and i do the same too. We continue to drink water and occasionally stand up to dance for a few minutes. We also went out to pee quite a few times. This lasts until 1- ish.


She says shes starting to comedown again and asks to take the remaining 2 piles. She also said that she heard smoking weed was a good mix with it. So we down the last 2 piles in water and go out for a quick hit with a waterfall bong. We come back and suddenly the world turns around crazy. We were the only ones in the room together, bawling for the first time in years while shes next to me too. We listen to sad sad lovey dovey songs and i constantly ask if shes crying. She always replys with no.

We calm down around 8-ish and she's on the bed with me again. We didn't sleep at all but i felt like i was in a trance of some sort. I wake up from it and give her the most dry horrid peck on the lips. I feel like shit.  We go out for a walk

The following days i felt very moody. A few hours after i woke up i went out to dance and i felt great. I went back home and immediately felt like shit. This cycle is still going on. I feel empty and useless at certain points but happy and hopeful at others. I constantly think back to what happened that night and I especially the intimacy between me and her. I read up online that .2g is not the normal dosage and realize that we fucked up big time. Whats really bothering me is the feeling that i felt ""love"" and that it was just ripped away from me. I keep on thinking whether or not she feels the same. im just a mess. I don't even know.

I'm pretty sure we fucked up on multiple multiple things. I also want to know your opinions on molly and love. I feel very lost in terms of my emotions right now. I also don't know how she feels.

 These guys took about a full hour and a half to kick in, here is where it gets interesting. After the rave i had already come down from those and i was ok to drive of course. When we got back it had already been about 7 hours since i took my last, so we both decided to take one each right away. We smoked a bowl (which always enhances it) and waited for a little. All of a sudden, it crept up pretty fast and i was feeling good, then after 30 or so minutes, i peaked for about 4 hours straight! i kid you not. Me and my buddy did light shows to some AMAZING prog house for about an hour! It seemed like everything was in slow motion but time was going by pretty fast in a way. Music moved through my body and soul. It was.... SO GOOD! I dont know if you guys feel the same way but this always happens haha. Anyway, music was so incredible to my ears i couldn't even explain. It was just so amazing. At one point I even told my friend, i want to hear them :)

I am having a difficult time reading these results with any reasonable certainty. On the ""Erowid's Ecstasy Testing Kit FAQ"" Marquis Reaction Chart page http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml it says that 5-MeO-DiPT has the exact reaction I observed (""fizzes then turns yellow quickly changing to a slightly rusty orange"")

SO I went back to Erowid's Marquis Chart (linked above) and based on that alone
3C-P because it turns ""Orange"" *but isn't 3C-P very uncommon?*
TMA-6 because it goes from ""Yellow to Orange""

But how seriously likely would either of these be in NYC being called molly?

Anyway, what do you think it most likely is?

Just a note: 
I have used this exact reagent before and had pure sugar turn from yellow to brown as expected; MDMA turn from purple to black; and sodium chloride fizz with no color change as expected- so I do trust my reagent.

Also:
The Marquis Reagent chart on its Wikipedia page doesn't have any entry that looks like my reaction. Erowid's has my exact reaction

tl;dr
NYC
they're capsules of granulated off-white almost yellowish powder
Marquis test: fizzed yellow then turned quickly to orange (and stayed orange)
Erowid's: says 5-MeO-DiPT; BUT EcstasyData: contradicts that...

1295480603.0,f5fy4,I tried MDMA for the first time last night...words cannot express the experience but i'll try.,,19,4,9,"
I have wanted to try MDMA / Ecstasy for ages. This past year has opened doors to new opportunities and MDMA was one of them. I met a girl, I tried, and finally a year later she got some pure MDMA for me. We decided to go out of town to small hippy town on a Tuesday night of all nights.

Mea and I didn’t know each other that well so this was kind of awkward at first because we both were putting a lot of blind trust in one another as we embarked on this Journey. Here is a little glimpse of how different we are. I wore a plain yet professional shirt matching hat and jeans. Mea wore her hair back with a orange flower in it. She wore a puffy vest

Mea had done MDMA lots and so she knew what to expect. I on the other hand had no Idea what to expect. We went to a bar and took the first dose. We then proceeded to walk the town strip meeting random strangers like Richard, who approached Mea and told her she was a queen. We decided to go into a karaoke bar. At this point Mea asked how I was feeling. I didn’t feel much and said I felt a little. Mea thought I had been expecting too much out of MDMA and what I was feeling was it. This bummed me out big time because what I was feeling was nothing like what I had read about.
We found a big cushy couch at the karaoke bar and took and seat and ordered some drinks while waited for Mea’s song. This is when I started having fun. We were snuggling on the couch and listening to crappy karaoke but it was all good. We stayed there for an hour talking to people then we decided to head back to the hotel and go in the hot tub.

Before going down to the hot tub we took another dose and smoked a bowl this set the mood just right. We grabbed a couple of beers and took them down to the front desk to get a bottle opener. The front desk guy was very quirky and noticing we were in our pool garb told us we couldn’t take our beers in the pool area. We took the beer to the pool area but left them to the side so we weren’t drinking in the pool.

We got inside the normal Jacuzzi and I entered the closest thing to heaven that I have ever experienced. I was holding Mea in the water and we were looking into each other’s eyes. Steam rose up around her head and she wore a small flower in her hair. She looked like an angel, but it didn’t. Maybe it did but cold was not a bad feeling just an alternate sensation to experience. We warmed up in the Jacuzzi again than headed back to our room.

When we got back to the room I was still in heaven. Mea drew a bath and we both got naked and got in. We washed each other and massaged each other. At this point if we would not have been on MDMA we probably would have quickly proceeded to sex but we didn’t. Sex wasn’t what either of us wanted to do we just cuddled and played in the bath until the water cooled and it was time to get out. 

My Angel then told me to lie down on the bed and she pulled out some baby powder and poured it all over my body and started massaging me. The powder worked like oil but not as messy. It was an amazing sensation. I then proceeded to give her the same powder massage only I also went down on her. She smelled and tasted amazing and I got lost in how long I spent pleasuring her. After this the effects started to ware off. It was 3 – 4am and we were starting to feel tired. We cuddled up next to each other and fell asleep.

This morning on waking up I felt great. Tired but not down or hung over. Things were a little strange between Mea and I in the morning. How do you experience something so monumental and life changing with a stranger in such a short time? What do you do with that?

I don’t know what to do and who knows what the future might hold. Mea and I are completely different people from completely different worlds. Most likely we will stay friends but that’s it. But I will never forget her because for one night she was my angel and the love of my life.

I took her to the train station and she headed home while I headed back to the business world.

1375650323.0,1jp6ze,"PLEASE READ if you are planning to try, or currently use MDMA... Our friend had a seizure last night after taking ~210mg over 3 hours",howlingatmyownmoon,27,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/1jp6ze/please_read_if_you_are_planning_to_try_or/

I am an experienced MDMA user (~12-14 uses), 7pm, and 8pm. He began to feel nauseous around 9:30-10pm and vomited several times over the course of the next hour. We attributed this to overheating and sunstroke, as we had been outside in the sun all day and he might not have had enough water.

We sat down on a hill in the shade, and we began to take public transportation home. Throughout this period he continued to drink a significant amount of water. At approximately 1am on a city bus he had an intense seizure, stopped breathing, turned blue, and began bleeding from biting his tongue. Honest to god, this was one of the scariest things I have ever seen.

We called 911, and unconscious, with intense lock-jaw. Multiple police cars, fire trucks, and an ambulance came to rush him to the hospital.

At the hospital, this has been an absolute nightmare, and we just hope that he's ok. Telling our parents and his parents what is going on has been extremely difficult.

What caused the seizures is still TBD. Was it the drug itself? Did he drink too much water and dilute his electrolytes? Something else? We just don't know... He may be completely fine

If you are planning to use MDMA

If someone becomes nauseous

Be very careful not to overcompensate when drinking water. It is unwise to pound water just because you think you are supposed to... drink regularly

Finally

Please stay safe.


**Edit 1:** So, but we were able to tell him about why happened last night. The cause of the seizures has been identified as drinking too much water, not bad drugs (confirmed as MDMA through hospital toxicology reports). This results in an unsafe drop in electrolyte concentrations, nausea, seizures, and death if untreated. He drank a lot of water, but not an outrageous amount (It's not like be was killing gallon jugs). Obviously the toxic amount of water varies per person... please don't find out the hard way. This would probably never have happened if we stayed out of the sun more during the day


**Edit 2:** He was released from the hospital this afternoon. His tongue is swollen from where he clamped down on it during his seizures, waiting 5.5 hours in the ER hoping your friend isn't dead is scary as fuck, calling your parents at 4:30am to ask them what to do is scary as fuck, meeting your friend's parents in the ICU and telling them how their only child ended up there is scary as fuck. You get the idea... You really don't want to have to deal with this. Not to mention the medical bills... His parents have health insurance, but this is still going to cost a small fortune.

First three paragraphs below this one are some background, and based on the following symptoms, some of you with a stronger knowledge may find that either it wasn't MDMA or, it was cut with something that gave me those particular reactions.

I guess this is more an anecdote for first time users, surely it will have worn off by morning, right? I'm a legal assistant at a large, international professional services firm that I won't mention the name of. I assist on a lot Australian Commonwealth and State Government / Public Sector work as opposed to Private Sector work which is handled by the other half of the team - I can't afford to not be able to pay attention.

My boyfriend (27) doesn't know I (23) occasionally use - recreational drug use is something we disagree on as he's only seen them destroy the lives of some of his friends and his cousin - doesn't believe they can be used safely in any capacity. He says he saw an awful change in their personalities and behaviours within a week from one pill. I think this was a result of a bad buy and not knowing what their product was cut with or how much to dose. His friends he said turned into total dickheads, kind, conscientious, and developed a total rage-filled psychosis after getting involved with drugs.

I believe everything can be used responsibly - though yes I understand entirely that I was not responsible in this recent situation and I take full responsibility and acceptance of what happened next because of the uninformed and unthinking decision I made to take too much of something I was unfamiliar with. I occasionally take my health and my life for granted

I tried MDMA for the first time off SR about 2 weeks ago. The pills were 220mg each. I took one, but not huge enough to really attribute it to the drug - I did so because I knew that was the variable in my evening though. After 2 hours, I was bored, feeling nothing, and thought ""huh, maybe the pills are bunk - guess I'll take another two and see if that works (stupid)""

So I now have 660mg of MDMA in my system. My boyfriend arrives at about 10pm to my place, bouncing my legs on the balls of my feet quite rapidly as we play. 

At about 2am, and starting to sweat lying next to him under the blankets. I ended up taking off all my clothes and lying on top of the blankets experiencing the pleasantly cool (reality - 4degrees centigrade) breeze coming through my open balcony door. He's concerned that I'm sick with something, though seeing as I'm naked and we're both awake we start fooling around after I assure him that really, I'm fine, just a little hot.

He goes down on me

My boyfriend lifted his head said 'what did you say? Are you ok sweetheart

He suggested that we should really go to sleep, my butt and my back. Every second or so I would have another spasm. My boyfriend is becoming quite concerned, I'm a little nervous but tell him I feel fine, maybe I'm just sick.

Three more times until I eventually fell asleep, my heart was beating fairly solidly in my chest, and every few beats there would be one that would cause my eyes to wiggle fairly strongly.

I sleep, and I see black scribbles furiously moving over and around my fingers, like I'm holding charged balls of energy. 

The walls look a little like they're breathing in the darkness

I get into the bathroom, and I had to keep reminding myself to breathe evenly, I hadn't passed out or died yet and maybe I'd feel better in a few more hours.

I got back into my room, I could barely stand, I had no sense of balance and my head was spinning unpredictably every time I moved. Not to mention the visual and auditory hallucinations. At about 7 am, my boyfriend woke up and got up to turn the fan heater on. Instantly I could hear jazz band music, and what sounded like people talking loudly out in the hallway. I mentioned this to him, and that I felt really dizzy - at this point my heart started *racing* and I a major panic attack (that I've never experienced before) with crying, gasping for breaths, around 8ish am

He tried to get me up to see how well I could walk, at which point he would have to leave for work - couldn't take more than a half day. He rang my mum and asked her to come down from Newcastle (2.5hours away by car), that I was very sick and needed someone to keep an eye on me. 

She came down, watching movies and shows on my computer. At about 8pm, after not getting up that day, I tried to follow her downstairs for dinner. I got to the bottom of the stairs and all of a sudden had a very loud and persistent ringing in my ears, they closed up, I could barely hear her or my brother talking. I slumped against a wall to catch my balance and I had an explosion of lights in my vision, which then whited out. It was like I was looking painfully through very bright static at everything, and my hand locked into a weird position which I then couldn't move. 

I said ""Mum, and took my hand and folded the fingers over herself a few times until I could move it, and then helped me to the table. 

I didn't eat

She stayed the night, at which point it changed into a happy little puppy. Mum was now asleep, I could hear her breathing had slowed right down. Then I heard her laughing lowly and in quite a scary manner, then talk rapid gibberish before laughing again, and then saying my name over and over. I knew she was asleep, I had been hearing music and voices all day, I tried my best to ignore it and go to sleep myself. 

The next morning, and as I have a sit-down job I felt I'd be OK at work. I was still hearing faint music, but not as invasive as before, and my stomach and smaller muscles through my abdomen felt a little jittery but overall the spasming stopped. I felt fine Friday night, and Saturday I started feeling very emotional whilst out with my boyfriend. I started having heart palpitations, and didn't sleep either of Saturday or Sunday nights due to very intense panic attacks and strange visual and auditory hallucinations that I found quite terrifying.

Please, and what an overdose will do to you.

My major mistake

I am more familiar with harder drugs. I've been exposed to cocaine a couple times, and buzz you full of energy. MDMA is far more gentle than those experiences, and not understanding how it would work on me, I re-dosed without really thinking about what I was doing, with the expectation that it would affect me like a stronger amphetamine would.

Most recently was after a roll I had Thursday night. I'm a huge Lakers fan, and I found myself overcome with waves of intense emotion. Enough to bring tears to my eyes. Seeing the home arena crowd fired up and hearing their chants over the TV gave me chills for most of the game. 

Also I found myself hugely invested in the Australian Open Womens Championships this last weekend. I don't usually watch Tennis but I never realized how intense it can be. Every miscalculated swing tore at my heartstrings and I empathized immensely with the athletes performing half a world away.

I think the most silly example was my gf was watching an episode of Friends Sunday morning which happened to be the last episode, but just couldn't control the strong emotions I was feeling.

I personally particular enjoy the strong emotional waves through my body. There is nothing like it aside from actually rolling. It also makes whatever I'm experiencing that much more enjoyable because I am that much more invested in it.

Of course, so we took a tiny bit more, probably a fingertip or two. I don't have a scale.

Then it hit, and have a very mellow baseline. My nickname is Spock for not showing emotion. Anyways, I just laid everything out there, completely honest. The bad side was that I really wanted to have more people out (and this was Valentines day), so I basically texted every girl in my phone. Bad idea. Next time I will turn my phone off. The feeling came in waves, and every wave I would just shake my head and close my eyes. It felt kind of like sex, but better and slower. I also was clenching my teeth like mad. Next time I will remember chewing gum.

We had a beer, then went out to a club, but mostly just ended up talking. I really wanted to touch the fabric and thighs of every girl there, but didn't feel the liquid courage that alcohol brings, just a greater desire to socialize.

Anyways, and I could feel my brain rewiring itself and reorganizing priorities based on this new feeling. I honestly think that I am not the same person today that I was yesterday. It's like I suddenly have to reevalute my entire life based on a new pleasure scale. I feel like someone else. I'm not sure if this should scare me or if I should embrace it.

It was also scary just how good that feeling was, I knew that it would never be as good as the peak, and I just wanted to chase that feeling all night. I find it kind of frightening to know that there is something that feels that good and it's so easily accessible. I know that I would just drown in it if I didn't have any self control.

For a while afterward I heard some strange noises, just because I was curious about sex and MDMA. I could get close, but there was a wall at the end and I couldn't finish it. Wasted a good 30 min in the shower trying.

1345744548.0,ypgbx,General Advice after seeing some question posts that I feel should really have been asked before and not after your first time,Dusty_Star,12,1,10,"Hi there rollers!

I know this is all on the side bar

All I really want to say is - ***read the freaking side bar before you try it***

Honestly guys

Over there &gt;&gt;&gt; in blue &gt;&gt;&gt; Drink water to prevent heat stroke

I just really want to give my personal advice which is this:

If you are trying this for your first time

.***Drink water until you pee.*** 

This drug will make you thirsty and it makes you thirsty for a reason.

MDMA dehydrates you so you *need* to drink lots and lots of water.

Not drinking enough water is very dangerous

So my advice is always feed your thirst until you pee

. ***Don't roll alone.*** 

In order to follow step 1

This person can look out for you and ensure you have water. It's really easy to forget about it if you're too busy having a good time - but you *need* water.

I always have a designated water person. They spend the night on alcohol and get given 30 quid of my money. Every time they buy a drink

. ***Do Not Mix Your Drugs.***

I have seen a few posts asking about the effects of coke and mdma when mixed and various other things.

The only thing I would ever *ever* offer someone who is rolling

That is just my personal advice however I would not reccomend mixing anything at all on your first time.

I personally don't see the harm in a few drinks before you take it

Honestly you don't need it.

Whilst MDMA is freaking amazing

All I want is for people to have a good time. And this page has provided everything you need to stay safe and have a good time - yet some of you aren't reading it.

*Please read the side bar*

Check out the How to preload and postload link for optimal saftey and effects.

Check out the Harm reduction section ***please*** just do it.

Also check out the test kit!

And finally check out Silk Road. Also on the side bar.

I really can't stress this enough. Where your drugs come from matters!

Before I knew about Silk Road, how they felt, how they looked, what the week after was like etc etc. 

Silk Road offers a much more secure way of going about your purchases. Please check it out.

Oh and one more thing -

You cannot anticipate the roll or it will never come, just sit back and relax."" I kid you not, 15 minutes later, she put her hands straight up in the air and said,"" in the happiest voice.

I always wait 1-3 months between each roll. I recently moved and don't know a local dealer so I did the research and bought 1g on SR from a very reputable dealer. Upon arrival I tested a little rock with the Mecke test which came up dark blue as I was hoping. Needless to say I was very excited. I took some empty pill capsules and measured out two pills

Usually it takes me 20-30 minutes to kick and the roll to come across my whole body but after 45-1hr

Now I had gone to this concert by myself as I just moved to this city and  wanted to get out there and try something new so as I was laying in the grass these two girls, just the kindness and generosity that I never see anywhere else. We ended up just talking for a while and I gave them massages and let them use my diffraction glasses and they honestly saved my night as it was going downhill quickly. We all went to the stage and saw Knife Party, who absolutely killed it BTW.

About three hours into the first pill my eyes would sake in waves maybe one every 5-10minutes. I had calmed down at that point and stupidly decided to take the second pill (10:30pm). The next hour and a half, I got dizzy like once every five minutes and would start to stumble before I regained my balance.

I tried this stuff at the Nuit Blanche in Montreal last saturday

I took my first pill at around 10 PM. We went for a walk downtown, I had fun while playing an 8bit game, then we went for the dome in the video I posted just above. THIS was cool as fuck. I took my second pill while we were there.

We then left. We went for a walk in the Art Souterrain (Underground Art). That's when I started rolling. I watched the ceiling of the place where we were: it was a high ceiling, like it was made of ice cream. Holy shit was it nice.

I then proceeded to hug everyone I could in Montreal while we were walking away from the exhibition. We went back the the SAT afterwards. I then talked for like half an hour to a guy from Manitoba who was 10 years older than me. Never have I been so attentive to other people

There was a DJ (Ghostdog) who was playing some 8bit dubstep stuff while there were the best animations I had ever seen playing in the dome. I danced like I never had danced before

We then continued on walking and hugging random people

The effects MDMA had on me are as follows:

* Opened up my vocabulary (I'm francophone
* Love for everyone (I don't like people usually). 
* Sociability.
* Energy. Lots of energy.
* Everything looks a LOT more beautiful. Especially girls.

Now, never understanding how my friends could have the stamina to stay well into the morning hours.

Yesterday was another one of those nights, but I'm fairly sure they know what they're doing so I don't worry about it.)

At this point I'm pretty tipsy and really baked, the hell with it, and ask my friend if I can have a tiny sip of his MDMA-spiked water bottle…

""Sure, this is a big deal for me, and my hands are shaking a little as I take two tiny sips because I'm so apprehensive. I decide to take a third sip because my first two were so cautious and hand the bottle back. I remember to glance at my watch so I can gauge my time perception: it is 2:15am.

---------------------

At first, or like my body is glowing. My anxiety has all but faded away, and I feel incredibly clear and lucid. In fact, I'm feeling considerably more head-sober than before, but I realise that this might be an illusion. At this point I check my watch again, thinking about 15 minutes have passed since my first dose; it's been an hour.

I'm offered some powder again and take my first dab on the tongue, and I reflect on how it feels like I can drink and smoke more than usual and still feel in control. This is the exact opposite of how weed and alcohol usually make each other worse when taken in combination.

At some point I go grab some fresh air outside and realise how weird walking feels. It's almost like I'm floating, and I just remember a perfect feeling of contentedness. Like everything was exactly the way it should be. I realised how I go through most of my life with a certain baseline of stress and anxiety, and how you can only really tell when it's completely gone for a change. Alcohol also does this if the mood is right, but at the expense of being drunk instead of ""clear"".

I find it very easy to immerse myself in the music. This is usually not difficult for me to do with music I really like, it usually feels like your focus narrows, to the point where only you and the the objet of your focus exist and you tune everything else out. On MDMA, you're still very much aware of your surroundings; especially the people around you.

---------------------

This is becoming a long story, but almost no alcohol after the first couple of beers, simply because the compulsion to always have a drink in my hand was less strong, and because I wanted to pace myself. I did drink a lot of water though, since everyone always says that's important. The place closed at 6am, and we went to similarly-themed afterparty until 9am. At some point I had another quarter-tablet. We finished off the night by going to the apartment of a couple that was with us, having 2-3 more doobs and talking.

Just as I'd read and heard, like how much they meant to me. But it still felt like it was ""me"". It wasn't the drug talking, it was simply enabling me to say things I feel that I would usually not mention in conversation.

One thing I noticed at this point in the night was that my short-term memory was completely fucked. Multiple times I would be in the middle of a sentence and have to stop, is also the reason that my time perception for the entire night was off. Everything felt shorter than it actually was, and it's probably because I kept forgetting small chunks of the night.

I stayed up for more than 24 hours, but like I could choose to ignore it if I wanted to. I went to sleep with a mild headache and, since I had to get up, set my alarm for 4-5 hours later. I didn't know what to expect, since I had heard that MDMA hangovers could be pretty bad, but I slept like a baby and woke up fairly refreshed, given the circumstances. I feel like, I would be considerably worse for wear.

It felt like I was just going through the motions. I'm not able to pinpoint any one thing that was different, but the phrase ""the magic is gone"" described it pretty much perfectly.

So my question is this: Have I permanently ruined molly for myself? I've heard it said that once the magic is gone

BACKGROUND:

So, but they hadn't overdone it with Addy XR the night before. My first experience was mostly intense heart palpitations, chest pains, mild euphoria, some beautiful light visuals, and mostly death-fearing panic. To say the experience killed my roll would be an understatement. Whether I actually had an overdose on amphs or not, I'm still unclear. From everything I've read

MOVING ON:

Two days ago, no addy, nothing. I was pre-loading with Vitamin C, Omega-3s, 5HTP.

The caps were tested and were a combination of MDMA and MDA. Unfortunately I do not know the percentages of each or mg dosage. Sorry.

On the day

The Gross Part: As I was coming up, it turned into an endless wipe. It turns out that things had opened up down there, nothing was coming out, but I believe I was probably trying to wipe my lower intestines clean. This went on for about 20 minutes as I cursed myself and said that I will never do this again. ""Fuck this. Never again."" I was googling trying to find some explanation online... to no avail. However, then I recalled a friend telling me about a similar experience. So, I made sure everything was in order and shrugged and left the portapotty. Yes, gross

Not Gross Part: I walked out of there saying ""I will never do this again."" Only to realize that I was rolling. Then I quickly started saying ""OK. OK. OK. OK. Yeah, when I dance sober people start coming up and giving me back massages because they think I'm rolling.

I met up with my friend. One was rolling on the same pills I took when I had my bad night. (White pumas with gold flecks aka MDMA and Methamphetamine) He was having a good time

I felt great, the lights looked enhanced, etc. However, while I was feeling great with a shit eating grin on my face, I was missing the whole empathic thing that I've heard about. This leads me to believe this may have been a higher MDA content than MDMA... or it may just be my personality.

We danced for a while until we went to see Orbital. My friend sometimes gets emotionally bummed out by trance, caught some other stages, met some new people, etc. Had a Vik's inhaler on me and it worked wonders bringing the roll back when it was dying down. I don't smoke, but I took a drag on my friend's cigarette, and that worked well too.

RE-DOSE: 

At the time, we should both do it. Around 10:50 (only about 3 hours until closing), we re-dosed. He took another puma I took another MDA/MDMA cap.

ROUND TWO:

I didn't have the same stomach issues as my first drop. But in about 30 minutes it hit me hard. REALLY hard. The three of us were walking vendor booths and talking when suddenly I felt like I was being pulled by the music. ""Sorry

Thing is

Pretty Lights came on, and went into what I can only explain as a full-body sustained orgasm. It was so intense that everything else kind of melted away. I was a bit torn as I really enjoy Pretty Lights and I wanted to dance, but I was too overwhelmed by this (which I was very much enjoying). I decided to roll with it and walk away and sit in the grass. I started talking to a group of girl who I explained that it was my first time... only to realize by their awkward responses that they were completely sober. After a few more minutes (or seconds, I'm unclear) I walked to catch the end of ATB's set. I sat on the ground listening to the music still overwhelmed by the full-body orgasm feeling.

When Dash Berlin came on, soaking it all in. Putting my arms up felt REALLY good for most of the night, this was no different. On each of his slower songs I would put up an arm and slowly walk through the crowd.

At this point the eye wiggles were getting intense. Combined with the trancers, otherwise it may have scared me... but maybe not judging by how good I felt. The wiggles calmed down a bit. I during this time I had a couple open-eyed visuals, very minor, things out of the corner of my eye. I thought a guy was leaning one way, but he was actually leaning the other. I forget what the other was, but they both occurred within the span of a few minutes.

My friends were pretty burnt so they were in the back sitting down. I met up with them and I sat down as well, I did get a few very clear visuals, as if you were looking at a picture, nothing like the visuals you get as you're going to sleep. These were photo-realistic almost animated-gif-like. It was only a few and they were very minute, something along the lines of a slice of pie sitting on a table in someone's backyard as the wind blows.

We stayed here for a bit, while orgasming, it's hard to do much.

We got back up and danced until close. After 2AM

I think I started coming down around 6AM when everyone else had been asleep for a few hours. On a risky move

The next day, but later I read that some claim the MDA can last up to 12 hours. So, it was possible.

Later that night

I had a number of myoclonus jerks in the evening

No major issues today on the back-end. I'm hoping that continuing to post-load with Vitamin C

If you made it this far, I'm in recovery mode today and I know my writing isn't really up to par.

Since this was my first time taking it I did it at home. Took ~130mg. Felt very little after an hour. Took another 60mg +T 1:30 after intial dose. Dancing is good fun and I was dancing for a good 90 minutes (although still have occasional feelings of tiredness). Definitely feeling the rhythm and had occasional hot flushes (probably due to the dancing). Don't see any change in visuals apart from maybe feeling slightly removed (tiredness?!). I'm also feeling quite happy but nothing incredible.

So what I'm wanting to know is how should I be feeling and could it be my setting that's not making it the incredible experience most people have?

I'm thinking of taking ~190mg straight up before going to a club this weekend to see if it is more effective. I'm aware that I should be waiting a month or two before redosing but I'm incredibly curious about the incredibly experiences most people seem to have. My stats: 5'10""

Currently +T3:00 in.

EDIT: Smoked a very small amount of weed earlier on and ended up stuffing myself with food. I'm now realising (stupidly) that this is probably why I didnt feel much for ages.

EDIT 2: Finally feeling extreme happiness (palms are sweaty, seems like the sociable angle to MDMA has arrived. To all those first timers out there I would suggest a few things:

- Don't spend the night ""experimenting with MDMA""
- Make sure you have a good playlist up. I danced for a good 90 minutes and now im sitting with my legs up listening to music and feeling like a god (even Radiohead is sounding happy!).
- Don't eat too much before. I had a very small joint in the early afternoon and ended up absolutely stuffing myself (to the point where I was desperately trying to squeeze one out to relieve the feeling of fullness). I'm fairly sure this is one of the reasons why the effects took so long to appear with me (unless it wasn't MDMA after all).
- Be careful if you're depressed. Seriously. I'm normally an incredibly depressed person in real life and despite being a very sensible person normally (the kind other people's parents like) I can tell I'm probably going to end up doing this more than I should just to escape normal life. Wish me luck and hope that I can hold out!

I guess some did, but there was a really weird air about a large portion of the crowd surrounding us who made themselves clear that they weren't happy with us. We weren't dressed crazy or pushing into anyone or taking up extra room. But despite our best intentions, I guess it was obvious we weren't sober. I didn't realise that this was an unexpected thing though? If you can't roll at a freaking dance festival, where can you roll? Besides at home

Is it becoming weird to roll at events these days? Is it a seriously frowned upon thing? I know I shouldn't really care what other people think,,False,self,t5_2qwvg,False,,True

I would really appreciate some strong advice or guidance for somebody who has strong expertise with the long-term interactions between MDMA/other entheogens and SSRIs

I am a 19 year old male
(Also dabbled with heroin for about half a year (due to depression/anxiety) but went to treatment last month and intend to stay clean)

Over the last year, which I have quit for the moment being.
I had a post a few months ago explaining my problems detail here in the mental health section if anyone remembers it: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/6...off-the-charts

I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 and a half months. I got diagnosed with social phobia/anxiety disorder, feel a bit blunted, have insomnia and weird vivid dreams sometimes, and feel a little bit more depressed at times. I know that I SSRIs take about 4-6 weeks to kick in (and I am on a new 20mg dosage....) but I am not seeing any big miracles yet. I think this is also in part because I am conflicted whenever I take the medication. I don't look forward to it. Why? Well because it means I won't be able to take MDMA or other drugs of the like safely. I would really like to discontinue my lexapro treatment... and I know that doesn't sound like it would be medically good for me but I really do miss ecstasy.

I love music and raving. And MDMA/psychedelics introduced me to a whole new world, it may have triggered some of the issues I am currently facing such as the social anxiety. However I have learned to be a more responsible drug user. I haven't touched MDMA/psychedelics in about 4 months anyways, and won't dare touch it especially on this medication. Another reason I want to return to it, is because I used to go to a lot of concerts with these 2 individuals who I considered close friends. Well, we aren't friends anymore, and they turned out to be very fake individuals. Do you know what it is like to have a ton of magical experiences on MDMA/psychedelics with people, but now no longer associate with and dislike you? It is pretty depressing. In part this was my fault, and I am hoping to meet a lot more genuine people

I have read that tapering off SSRIs is hard

I would like to get off it ASAP

I was blown away. 

Pretty Lights started at 1 AM and was basically 70

There were 5 of us - 3 girls and 2 guys - all rolling for the first time. I didn't really know the guys or one of the girls very well, I didn't see much of point. But boy was i wrong.

After the usual stuff that happens the first time - heart rate,000 best friends with exciting things to show me. 

I had coincidentally brought with me a fairy wand that lights up and has different settings. Not knowing molly

As I started my way into the crowd of people, giant glowing eggs, light up hoops, or just glowing paint, the world was an oyster of new things to rediscover and new friends to make. I am so happy I didn't know how amazing it would be. A nice girl tried to put some kind of stick up my nose and for a second I got scared - i thought it was drugs! turns out after some explaining it was Vicks VapoRub. It was AMAZING! Another nice guy (after a brief kiss) gave me spearmint chewing gum. That was amazing too!

As a sea of 70, thanks to pretty lights. I even made a facebook friend (it took 30 seconds).

But the best part was the amount that I bonded with the people I came with. Turns out one of the guys was an amazing freestyle rapper! And sharing a relatively tough comedown with the new girl made us immeasurably close. We talked about what it felt like when we first met each other and our first impressions/expectations. We talked about everything.

After a few hours of pretty lights, we jumped, we touched a giant mushroom (it was a fountain but it had turned off. Sad, but didn't dampen our spirits). And then we went back to pretty lights and finished off the night with a hug.

As the sun rose, a heat wave shoots through you and you don't want it to leave. But i was peaceful. I was tired, and peaceful and happy.

While new girl and i were coming down

It was perfect. I was a child. I was an adult. I was amazed. I was floating - I am still floating. I danced like an idiot for the rest of the festival whenever i felt like it. I joined in with the rolling people. I danced by myself. I was happy and free.

As someone who is a tad hyperactive and thrives on community

I know this is a really really long story and if you read the whole thing

also - random question. I waited a day to smoke any weed and got weirdly hyperactive and extremely high the next time i smoked. It was fun...but weird. Any thoughts?

e.g. is 200mg  twice as strong and high as 100mg?

We have found a cheap paddling pool that we plan to fill with glow sticks. There is also a very cheap ""slip n slide"" in a local toy store that I think would be amazing. In the past, so I would love to hear any water related ideas. 


A friend of a friend recommended that we drink tea. I'm unsure of this as I'd already be overheated


One of my favourite mdma memories is having my teeth brushed by my boyfriend. The minty taste was wonderful.


I found the following suggestions on online forums; rubbing feather dusters on each other, using hand soap (especially the stuff that foams up a lot), giving each other massages, going up and down stairs, eating listerine strips, putting hot water in a bowl and feeling the steam on your face.

- After (i don't remember time after , i begin to feel a little descent too but the friend who find the D and who was more experienced told that with D ""you have ups and downs but it's not over yet ;)"" , so i go to a bonefire where all ""my"" friends are , down the field , we talk , have fun , my crush who didnt roll this time to ""assist"" the first timers in case of badtrip or what (she's a GGG isn't she ? :)) , at the fire , she began to give me a head and hands massage that was almost orgasmic ! She then suggested we smoke a fat joint in the tent next to us with two other close friends , talk and i drop my second bomb with TASTY orange juice (that was one of the intense memories) and get of the tent.

-02:34 (i just remember the exact time when i dropped my second bomb) we come back to the bonefire and i think he is one of the most beautiful thing i saw in my life . I lie beside and looks closely, its undulations, its sparks, crackling sound, it fascinates me, I passionate me . My crush told me i was like that for 2 hours , saying : ""Oooooh ! Woooooooow !

I have always waited at least 3 months between rolls and have been pre/post supplementing (I did the complete recommended preload from the top post on /r/drugnerds for this most recent roll) since my second time. The roll was very underwhelming

Unless my good friend pulled a fast one on me (I know that this is possible, it had me absolutely out of my mind - and it tested positive for MDxx with the Marquis reagent. I took between .2 and .25 of powder, orally, most of it at once and the rest during the come-up. This is about the same amount, if not more, than I took last time.

Come-up was nothing too unusual... I had this feeling like I was suddenly taller than everyone else and that I could ""see everything."" Not long after that I was rolling and it lasted for a few hours, my friends decided to leave the show early and I actually recall being fairly angry/disappointed in them (""They're going to leave?! Fuck them!""): feelings that I wouldn't have thought possible during my previous three experiences. I was never compelled to smile for no reason... I was just able to lose myself in the music and dance hard. None of the beautiful feelings, just the effects I'd imagine I'd get from taking straight speed.

Is it possible that I've already lost the magic in just four uses, but from what I've read there isn't much cross-tolerance so idk if that had anything to do with this. Maybe it was something else sold as LSD that could have dulled my roll? Or is it more likely that my friend swapped my good MDxx for something like meph/methylone? Is it possible that my friends leaving put me in a sour mood that just couldn't be overcome by MDMA?

1st time I ever used was a pill - CK. The euphoria hit me so strong I had to sit down. It hit while I was walking down a huge hill into the city centre and I just stopped

I went to the toilets &amp; sat on the floor for 30 minutes debating over if I needed an ambulance. It felt like my brain was on fire. Then it just stopped and I hit some sort of spiritual plane.

3rd time I had a blue defqon. Took half which was amazing

1. I haven't done anything particular since then and am a little bit worried. Are there any vitamins I should be taking or sleeping extra in order to make up for rolling on Saturday?

2. Did I take too much? Most places say about 100 mg is a solid dose, as my friends thought I would be rolling until midnight? Is individual resistance to the drug a thing?

I took two of them on the spot, i chewed them up in my mouth and they tasted like shit, which is great. They looked like blue ovals
Thirty minutes went by and Hardwell got on stage and i rolled my fucking face off. I had to stop for a minute because it was almost too much.

The first time I took MDMA, who took the same MDMA and the same dose, reported that they were tripping quite hard. No problem sleeping afterwards, and no hangover.

The second time, I decided to snort additionally 200 mg. The rush came quickly and was very enjoyable, but I still felt that the effects were not as high as what others seem to experience even with a 150 mg dose. No hangover, no problem sleeping.

The last three times I have taken MDMA, but the hours sure pass quickly when I am in my bed and close my eyes. The hangover is pretty much just a mellow tickling feeling in my body, and a ""lagging"" feeling when I turn around or move quickly. After a few days, everything is normal and I don't feel very burnt out as some people report after taking high doses.

I rolled yesterday for the first time. It was really funny, am I dying? Will I ever recover ? Have I broken my brain?"" I reassured myself that it would go away in a few hours. A few minutes before that I noticed that I was feeling a little more relaxed and my heart was beating faster. Then I was texting my cousin and talking about how my father putting up people to call me and trying to control me really frustrates me/hurts my feelings. I had just typed the text to her and hit send when I felt sadness almost physically hit me and I started sobbing. Usually I'm very very numb and anxious. I have not cried that way since I was maybe 5 I think. I was doing MDMA primarily for PTSD so I felt sad many times during it but I felt like I could be sad and then happy in a few seconds in not a mood swingy but weirdly in what felt like an authentic way, in that I wasn't suppressing sadness/numbing myself in order to feel happy. I had some realizations about my parents growing up, ways in which they were unavailable to me that caused me to feel ashamed. I had some inkling of these things but it was like a faint inkling and ""maybe, maybe not"" I did not see these realizations coming AT ALL. I guess maybe it was just too anxiety provoking for me actually stay with.

I did the MDMA alone in my dorm room because the friend I wanted to do it with was busy and I didn't want to wait until next week to do it when I would have a dozen homework assignments. I was/am a bit concerned about what my roommates thought. I'm not really sure what to say to them... ""umm I was working some stuff out"" ? I am afraid that they would know I was on some kind of psychedelic. Maybe I can just make an excuse that my grandfather died or something.

I called up the friend who was busy and we still talked about some things. I disclosed some private stuff about my father. I'm not sure how I feel about having shared that with her now. I realized some things about my family and had some memories come up. I had been having flashbacks and I feel that I have a fuller picture of some trauma that happened to me. Some of it is like

I had one of my profs who I was feeling alienated from and while I was rolling I think I remembered his facial expressions in a funny magnified way and I think now that he is and always has been ""on my side"" or at least this is what I said to my friend on the phone while I was rolling. I just asked to work with him so I guess we will see what he really thinks. I'm afraid I'm wrong and he isn't but I feel like he is. I think that he thinks that I'm very very smart. He has always looked at me with a lot of concern and I feel now like he knew things about my life and that's partly why he was concerned but I really am confused as to how. MDMA is an amazing drug

With MDMA I did not feel numb

I also called a friend of mine who made a very unkind remark (along the lines that the trauma I suffered was my fault) that triggered most of the flashbacks three years ago who I was unable to talk to about how disappointed I was in her actions. I told her calmly that I was disappointed and that I can't be friends with her if she can't sort out her own issues. She kept sort of trying to deny it like she usually does but instead of getting overwhelmed and overruled by her demeanour I was able to stay with my feelings and think, and I just couldn't give up the hope that someone from there would get it and get me. I think because MDMA allowed me to feel sad and not numb it, I was able to feel the sadness long enough/observe my emotion long enough to ask why the sadness and make this realization. I was able to feel sadness over having to give that up/give her up yesterday.

I think that in my childhood a few people knew something awful was happening but they just didn't know what to do about it. I realized that my grandmother before she died really wanted me to recover and have a good life. She knew I was traumatized and that I needed help and she believed that I deserved to have a good happy fulfilling life. I think she felt somewhat helpless and I believe that she was.

I was really anxious as I was coming down from the MDMA, I feel like I am open to things but I'm also feeling anxious like I don't know if I can quite handle this.

One thing I am struggling with a bit now is that while I was rolling I realized and accepted (?) to some extent I am very smart. While I was rolling I realized that a few people in my life really like me/admire me for my mind. I feel sad about how I have continually tried to hide/been unable to express that part of me. Having come down now I am quite uncomfortable with thinking that

I'm feeling a bit unmotivated/lethargic/depressed today. I've been thinking of going to the gym since that often makes me feel better.

TL:DR This is a surprising drug. I don't understand how it MAKES you feel things. I'm still feeling a little bit overwhelmed about how it makes you feel things.

1334646366.0,sdvue,First Time Experience(Three Weeks Ago). Damn.,rolleneff,9,2,6,"This is gonna be a long one so prepare yourself!!!
Some backround info: my friend(we will call him bob) and i decided that we would like to try ""rolling"" because we had heard so much good stuff about it. We smoke weed on a daily basis, but we said that it wouldnt be as good as bud(WRONG). We also live in hawaii, on oahu. still in high school/senior year.

Saturday came and we were out and about at around 2pm. Bob's friend was suppposed to get us the rolls around 4 so we had to wait till then. This was the same weekend as a rave, browsing stores and find out that bob's friend cant get the rolls, and our other friend has to go to work so now theres four of us. I call up my friend who supposedly also could ""hook us up"" but he couldnt get either. now were bummed out and calling every person on all of our contact lists to see if they can get ecstasy and after 45 mins of trying, this girl says she can but not till 930 and its only 730 so we all decide to go to the beach(our secret spot) and burn some to kill time. We get high as fuck and head to mcdonalds cuz everyones hungry. I read a lot about rolling the past couple of days so i decided not to eat at all and just sip some water. they ate their blazed brains out while i just sat there waiting and starving. 10:00 came and we didnt receive a call so we called the girl and its a negative, no ecstasy from her. Now were really pissed and then a couple minutes later another close friend calls to see what we r up to that night. We let him know our situation and he tells us he can get us some mollies in an hour guaranteed!!!!! he tells us to meet him at a park close by and we wait a little at another park(found a big bouncy ball there and we started kicking it around like dumbasses). 11:00 we meet him and hes got it! 11:30 we take the pills, we all took one each at that time. and head to Sandy's, a beach on the other side of the island. We arrive there around 12:10 and i need to piss bad! none of us are feeling the molly yet so we decide to roll a j, i couldnt even move i just wanted to swim in that upside down tsunami. then it just went away and i was back in reality and found myself screaming LOL. and my friends just laughing at me

Now while i was sitting in the car i was trippin hard...i just felt good, a really hot brain. and i remember myself screaming and taking some deep ass breaths. now my memory blacks out on the way back to town but we arrived at the beach once again to smoke and met up with another friend who just wanted to smoke some weed. it was felling kinda chilly so i was telling everybody that i could really use a jacket right now and then bob pulls out a hoody from the back of the car and i just didnt know what to say. it was the happiest moment of my life!! i put that hoodie on, and i felt like spiderman when he turned into black spiderman, the black hoodie was just taking over my skin.

We walked down to our spot by the beach and laying on the ground was half a coconut tree kinda like a stump but not attached to the gound it was cut down and parellel to the ground, all night and just hug. eventually i realized how stupid i looked and got up and followed them back. still feeling realllly good we sat in the car and listened to music for 20 mins then decided to pick up more rolls. my other friends usually take more than one in a night so i said fuck it, lets go get some more. we had to drive out about 20 miles to go get them and when we were almost there my friend says, where are we goin? and at that point we all just burst out laughing. apparently he got a text when we first got on the freeway saying, dont go that far to meet up with the dealer cuz they were back in town(waikiki) again but he forgot to tell us about the text. so we drive back to waikiki and finally get the mollies and i got one more, idk how much everyone else got. now its around 320am and i start getiing calls from my parents said i have to get home UHOH. so on the way home i take the molly(BIG MISTAKE) 330am and get inside and go to my room. feeling fucking AWESOME and get my headphones out and start to listen to my techno/light dubstep playlist. Cant sleep so i get up and start dancing/fistpumping, i guess i was making a lot of noise cuz i woke my parents and i look to my right and my dads just standing there like

anyways thats my first trip and glad i was wit friends cuz idk what id have done if by myslef or at a rave. ahahha i want to see more posts like this on here...If u guys can remember.cuz my other two times were at parties. And thanks for reading.

When I received them, so I'd estimate it to be at about 160mg. When I rolled, I really liked it, and I definitely didn't feel like it was too much. It was very manageable and I had a great time.

For my second time, and yet when I took 3/4 of a pill I was dancing fine and had a great time rolling. The general consensus on this subreddit also seems to be that ~220mg is kind of a high dose. I'm a fairly big dude (6' 2"", 220lbs), so is it possible that I would have a higher tolerance to MDMA? I also load up on supplements before, during, and after my rolls, make sure to stay hydrated

So my three questions are:

1. How the hell do I cut a pill without destroying it? My kitchen knife disintegrated a quarter of the pill.

The first time I rolled I was at a concert, my hearing was gone and it was only me in a room filled with hundreds. I also felt like I was going to get lost really easily.  So I sat in a corner trying to get over the anxiety but eventually retreated home where I then had an amazing experience just talking to my boyfriend(also being in the car felt amazing). The anxiety at the concert kind of imprinted and at every concert I went to afterwards I would get super anxious and want to go home.

Second time, no anxiety whatsoever. I ended up talking to my best friend of six years for hours on end about everything. Time flew by and it was a lovely experience, I felt so purely myself with no worries and no outside factors changing me in any way and I honestly couldn't wait to take it again. 

I'm sure the kinds of pills I took makes a difference

Now this Friday, but I'm afraid I'm going to panic again. I loved everything about my experience at home. So any advice on how to deal with that initial anxiety would be tremendously appreciated.

Person would abstain from Adderall usage a minimum of 30 days prior to dose and MDMA is pure.

I bring up Adderall also because not only does MDMA fall within the same family of drugs it has also been known to cause a slight cross tolerance with MDMA and leads me to believe that if one can metabolize dextro-amphetamine with no ill effects that they can also metabolize MDMA as a result.

A) Going to make my own caps with a mg scale with a simple math ratio to start going down 10mg each time. So since 170 was too much

OR

B) Going to take heavy dosed pills and just take half then redose the other half at come up/peak.

But..since I was not really a big drug user in the past , green

One of the reasons I took it was because we were going to a club downtown (Chicago).  My friend is actually a major player at this club and so its always fun to go down there regardless.  

Anyways, so the faience and her sister ended up just dropping us off and going back home, which made the night a lot more fun.

It seemed to do a little something but not much
I actually become a center of attention at times since, which was nice. 

I eventually got another one from my friend and then I start feeling REALLY HAPPY.  I feel like I had never been so fucking happy and just enjoying myself.  Unfortunatly it did not help me get any women at the club, and we had gotten there late anyways.

So after my friend made some money and the club closed down we decided to take a cab, to think.  I explained to my friend how stupid that was and what a waste of money, but he did not care.

We ended taking the cab to a Diner to chill out for a few and wake up some.  My friend kept falling asleep in the cab

We ended up deciding to meet up with this chick in the suburbs.  So we took a 45 min cab drive  from the city to his Fiance's place to grab my car to drive to her place.  She worked the grave yard shift at some place and got off of work at 6am.    I don't think we got to her place until 7 or 8 

This chick was something else. I had never met her before

This girl was all about partying and and doing MDMA. She was not someone who looked COMPLETELY messes up or something.  She was actually a very cool person, not HUGE , but not unnoticeable either.   

So we picked her up and checked in at a hotel to stay.  Now I am not a person that likes to be around other guys when sex with a girl is around

Anyways, even though some of her curves kind of through me off.  Something about her being pretty, mysterious , and experienced really turned me on.  It was also weird at the same time, because she seemed to look different every time I looked at her, because of the lighting , or something else.  Kind of like that Seinfeld episode! 

And of course I had no fucking insecurity because of the MDMA.  It really felt like we were connecting.  Enough that I went straight to just straight up asking her if she wanted to ""fool around""  probably the lamest thing you can ever say to a women

But after awhile she wanted another pill, so I told him it I would pay for it, as well as another one for me.

The rest of the day got kind of crappy now that my friend was up.  there was no privacy, the dude just had to fuckin but in and fucking say something.  Maybe I was being selfish?  Or maybe the dude has a fucking ego and can't let other people do things with out him being involved.  

There was nothing else that really happened in the hotel, they went to go have a smoke downstairs, and my friend asked her if she would by DOWN for doing stuff with me upstairs and she said she was.  Now, since it had been a LONG time since I had charged my phone, I had decided to turn it off and save some battery.  What I didn't know was that my friend had sent me texts saying that she was down, but I had to make a move!  Which of course I did not see until we dropped her back off at home at around 530pm.  

The more I had thought about it

Anyways

I got home and crashed for two hours, but that she was out drinking.  We had a little more back and forth , and I told her we should do it again some time, and she agreed.  (Just me and her obviously)

I could not fall asleep until around one and I had to get up for work around 730.  Work REALLY sucked, my life , most things about myself, being stuck where I am in life because of not making sacrifices, and I STILL FEEL effects of the pill.  Like it has not worn off completely yet.

I think I made the mistake of taking way too much for my first time.  But work was a mess for me yesterday and today, but never got a response....  I suck with women, so I am not sure how to play it at this point.  My fascinating with her is also fading.

Anyways

The color wheel that came with my test said that this meant it could be: Naphyrone, MDPV, or MDPPP.

...From searching this subreddit it seems most likely that it's Methylone

**UPDATE**: I tried it, at peace, happy and ""in the moment"". I was able to have discussions about difficult stuff that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise.

A friend decided to DJ with his laptop on. My visions had subside and there's no 'wavy' paths. It was back to euphoria state. Feels good man. I really couldn't feel any downs nor any jaw-clenching at all. It was all good times. However

- *0600hrs*. I can feel like it's coming down very, I'm feeling all good and was chatty unlike other times with Ecstasy. Joints were passed to the left at the same time. Hunger striked me. I finished a bar of Muesli down with some grapes and water. Actually, I was unsure if it's actually really coming down or not because some songs hits back right in. A friend decided not to eat because he wasn't hungry and he said the roll is still in him. We had great conversations unlike before and we thought the pre-loading supplements may have played their role decent enough.

After this point of time, teeth grinding nor any downs at all. I will not claim that it has to be the herb because even with herb on previous sessions, I still do the jaw-clench. Anyways, no one is feeling the down when we departed to our own ways.

Anyways, and 30 minutes later start feeling the lifting body high flush sensation. It felt weirder than usual, and scared me for maybe a minute tops before I became adjusted and felt the love waves hit me like usual. It feels great, though the speed rush hits me hard enough to make me vomit some phlegm (been an issue the past few days, so I’m not surprised), and then things are peaking beautifully. She breaks the heart into four pieces, and takes a tiny piece at 11:46pm. She feels a tiny bit of something, then a third small piece at 12:34. I looked at the dose after everything chilled out

She noticed little effects, feeling up the carpet/cat/everything and enjoying the textures, the whole feelsgoodman.jpg deal. I’m happy, she’s in bliss, and we’re listening to music and everything’s solid… until about fifteen-twenty minutes later, when she starts to get quiet and upset. Things seem to be becoming too much for her, and she says that she wants it to stop. It stopped being fun and enjoyable, panting, she screamed. It was more than just that

Like, and then she’d get a calm for a minute or two and state that she couldn’t control it, that she screamed because it helped alleviate the pressure in her chest (? It looked like she was pointing near where the collarbones connect to the rib cage?). This went on for an hour, with me holding her and trying to soothe her as best I can while she constantly asks questions and says things, like “I’m going to die” “OMG” “My body is rejecting it” “Am I going to be this way forever?” “You’re sure I’m going to be okay?” “Omg” “MAKE IT STOP!” “HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO LAST?”, trying to cry but being unable to get any tears out, digging her claws into me and trying to grind her fist against the wall “to feel pain”. Said she was scared

I can’t go anywhere to try to get something that could help her. I ask if she can stand up, but she refuses to move from where she’s planted on the futon and begs me to not leave her. I have to go use the restroom, and she’s calling my name in desperation. I tell her she can take this GABA/L-Theanine relaxation pill to help, but she doesn’t want to “take anything else”. There was no solution I could provide. Eventually I managed to get her into the living room so I could make some tea in the kitchen, but she’s grabbing my arm and trying to pull me back. I go into the kitchen, and she slams herself into the ground in the living room, clawing at the carpet, an exhibition close to madness. 

She eventually went to use the restroom for the first time since she’d been taking it, and at this point she’s no longer screaming, but is pacing around the entire apartment very quickly, constantly, and doesn’t stop for another half-hour to an hour, during which she slowly calms down. We determined that when she started pacing was when she “plateaud” and wasn’t getting another speed boost, which is why she was able to maintain some control. 

After this half-hour to an hour of her pacing around, but is clearly very much traumatized by the event. We rested a few hours later for a few hours, and she still felt weird and energized/pacey, but not where it was before. The next day, she woke up from six hours of sleep with a massive energy buzz and a panic attack, and was pacing from 8am-3pm with her eyes dilated again, and then paced once more at 6pm when others came home. What? The second day of being sober, her anxiety attacks stopped happening

I’ve never, but I’ve never known anyone to have such a severe reaction from 2/3 of a pill.

Two things to note, it may be that it peeled off layers of protection against panic attacks. But, that’s a complete guess from me. The second thing is that she isn’t on medication – that means she didn’t take any SSRIs or MAOIs, pain medication, etc. This has left a scar on her, a scar which could take a while to heal, and I feel terrible for putting her in this situation – but I have never heard of/seen such a violent and opposite response to it

Aprox. 9:25pm- The come up was chilling nothing i couldnt handle typical lights getting brighter and music sounds great couldnt really focus on conversation, its as if i was shot out of a rocket and a huge wave crashed over me of warmth that was extremely intense and i kept riding that wave. i could even describe it like an explosion of warmth through out my body. I then couldnt sit up right any more and put my hands on me head but all i could say was ""WOOOOW OH MY GOD"" i felt like i couldnt breath for about 30 seconds but i told my self to calm down youll be fine because it was only the drugs, i also got a sort of tunnel vision and everything got black im not sure if that was the drugs or my body going into a kind of shocked state. i asked my friend to bring me my gatorade took a sip and calmed down a little but i was still panicking  a tad so i walked somehow to my friends bed with my friends close behind making sure i didnt fall then i flopped on the bed trying my hardest to respond but i couldnt. i heard what people were saying but it sounded muffled as if someone had put i cup to my ear along with a ringing noise that didnt last to long though. my friend handed me a bowl of weed and took a hit which definitely leveled me out and felt much better. got lots of eye wiggles so it was a little difficult to walk. i then began to enjoy my night with all of my friends hugging, talking and just hanging out with them. head massages are the best. I was on that bed for a little over 2 hours not sure why, i was happy in that room, it was beach themed so it was super relaxing, i didnt want to move at all, got some bad vibes from some of them sadly :/ 

aprox. 12:30am- By this time i started to come down still feeling some of the effects but obviously not as much. the come down was EXTREMELY clean and smooth not a huge crash like ive had in the past where i felt like complete shit where it was similar to having the flu. i just felt exhausted this time. the whole trip lasted about 5 hours

approx. 3:00 am- i finally fell asleep completely since everyone had left. 

approx. 11:00 am- woke up still feeling tired and a slight headache which couldve been from sleeping wrong and just basking in the after glow

TL;DR: Had a great time, i loved it. Need to fix the dosage though.

*DISCLAIMER* use some caution with pure MDMA

1373846049.0,1iaztv,Escaping the old me. Looking for some different advice for my first time rolling.,EscapeTheBarriers,4,2,17,"So as you read from the title I’m nearing the time of my first roll (super excited).  Although I have done extensive research about this magnificent drug I still need some strange advice.  While I feel this may be the wrong sub for the advice I’m looking for it may be the most beneficial since the experience with MDMA here is superior. 


So a little back story, but I’ve found myself still not having much to say or contribute to conversations.  I almost feel like I’m not necessarily a shy person anymore, I just have had this persona for so long that it’s hard to expand past it being as I don’t do much else besides little things by myself.  


So my question to you lovely people is should I even worry about what I need to talk about during the experience or will this just completely open up a new side of me.  I really want to take full advantage of every social situation I may encounter so I’m curious to what I could possibly have at my disposal for deep discussions and just simple talking to people.  I’ll be at a music festival with only one person I’ve known for a few years
It may seem like a bizarre question but I really would like to take away from this experience completely since it could potentially be such an eye opener.  It may be quite some time before I get invited to something like this again.


I understand that it is a drug and it’ll be just an altered state of mind but I really want to reflect back on this and change the way I am


Thank you for reading

Much love!

I will label this post in parts so you can ""fast forward the stories"". 

Background
To get started I want to give a little background about me. I am a teenage male,fast intense workouts) who is new to substances. I have been overweight until about a year ago where I lost over 30 pounds, but I still have confidence issues.  I have been smoking weed for just about a year on and off and have had a somewhat high tolerance than compared to all of my friends. My highs don't last as long and aren't as intense unless I smoke continuously. 
I just started drinking and have a tolerance with that as well for never doing it before. Anyways it's annoying. 

Now to my first experience rolling at my first rave/music festival 

I first tried ""molly"" when I was at ultra this year. I had met up with a guy  (ill call him zack) i new from my town and bought two pills then left to hang out with my friend (ill call him jimmy) It was Saturday around noon and I popped my first pill at the trap/bass stage. I first started feeling it around an hour and twenty minutes later. Suddenly music sounded better

Fast forward to about 10:30. At this point I took the other pill at 6 and felt the same moderate high. Finally me and Jimmy met up with his friend Kate who was from Miami and had connections. She gave us capsules and we took them and started to get ready for Deadmau5. An hour later they were telling me they were telling me that they were rolling and said not to worry I would feel it soon. Finally an hour later it hit me. I had my first good roll. Lights were amazing, just opening up and having a great time. 

Sunday
Next day I took pills from zack throughout the day that lacked the quality I had the night before so I stopped. Went and saw Snoop Dogg perform and managed to snag a joint for a couple hits. After this I met up with Kate and Jimmy at knife party took a hard pill then left to get ready for the final performance from Swedish House Mafia. An hour had passed since I took the last one and everyone was rolling but me. Kate said she wasn't gonna let me have a bad night so she gave me a double. This thing was Different to what id seen before. I clear capsule filled to the top with crystals. Thinking nothing of it I took this double then we went over to see the performance. 45 minutes after the double I started rolling with everyone. We had met some people and formed a group. At this time Kate and Jimmy were rolling hard and had to leave to rest for a bit. I stayed with my new friends having a moderate roll but still nothing like what everyone was talking about and we were all shocked. We all took the same stuff so it couldn't be bad quality. 

Second time. 
After ultra I stayed of Molly for three months till another one day festival. Over the course of 12 hours I took two spread out in the first six hours with no prevail then 2 at once then smoked a half joint within 30 minutes. Still a moderate roll but nothing crazy. 

4th of July 
Found a new dealer and took .3 orally with friends at the beach. Just had a chill roll. Talked a good bit but no body high or excitement as my two other friends. 

6th of July 
Found a new dealer who had some real ""fire"" Molly. Took .8 at once and had the same moderate to low roll that lasted an hour compared to friends who took .25 and lasted 2 and half hours. 

Overall I've had a variety of pills but none effecting me as much as my friends. 

I know I need to get a tester but it's hard because I still live at home. I'm planning on rolling in a month and want to have a incredible experience. 

If anyone has any ideas what's going on I'd love to know. I'd be stupid to think all of my stuff is pure MDMA but still shouldn't I roll as much as my friends? I mean .8 is less effective in me then .25 in my friends who rolled the same days as me?

TL;DR 
Have taken ""Molly"" at four separate occasions with friends and haven't had the same roll as friends and even took more at some points.

I was also rolling with 2 of my roommates. We all took it at about the same time and we were rolling by the time I was up too. We all started to hug, or shout. My one roommates was her first time. When I saw it hit her I could just tell how much she loved it.
I then proceeded to head to my friends house where my one roommate was dancing the whole time with me. Her and I also had to strip down to almost nothing because it was so hot feeling with the dancing and the no AC :(.
We then went back to my apartment and just chilled out for a while before heading to a party. During this whole time my other roommate was suppose to bike to the place I was at

So I've been wondering about this a LOT lately.

Common knowledge tells us that MDMA causes neurotoxicity by flooding the Serotonine Axons in the brain  which affects our nervous system(amirite?). You basically deplete all of your Serotonine by using MDMA.

Now I've been reading up on how to make the neurotoxicity less severe

To me this instantly sounds like 5-HTP doesn't help you at all, everyone says it's really good to take because it'll help your body recover MUCH faster after ingesting MDMA (even read a topic where someone suggested taking a cap a  few hours prior to dosing MDMA).

Can anyone please explain me why 5-HTP helps your body recover

•Antidepressants should never be taken with MDMA

... Isn't 5-HTP an antidepressant?

TL;DR many websites claim that 5-HTP helps your body recover

As for the other questions, I know this isn't the smartest thing to do. But what would be the best thing to reduce all risks? Aside from not taking it at all.

What I've found to help so far:

Romance. I don't have particularly string ties with my family or friends. The ones I do connect with are out of state and digital communication is my only way of keeping in touch. Having someone that I'm intimately connected with really, especially those I love. It's also an irregular circumstance to find myself in. So while effective, it's not a readily available solution. I may find myself in one soon, but that's neither here nor there.

Lucid Dreaming. Usually, It's also very irregular and despite my efforts, I haven't had that ""breakthrough"" where I can do it more often than not.

Marijuana. I've only started a month ago, the effects are relatively short-lived, (I have to smoke every few days to stay ""up""), and it also stays in your system for a long time, whichever makes finding employment even more difficult than it already is.

Alcohol. the least effective thing on this list. It helps

Meds. They usually just make things worse.

Therapy. It's nice to talk about stuff

Cigarettes. Pretty obvious

I did feel like if I had taken about 50mg more I might have been able to reach that spot, but it was already nearing the end of the event so I didn't want to take any more. 
I have only rolled four times. My first time is the only time that I rolled face and that was in mid-May. It wasn't tested but from the experience I believe that it may have been the purest molly that one could find nowadays. I felt like I was in another magical world. My second time was such shitty ""molly"" that I wasn't even rolling, so I was already a bit hungry when I dropped. I am not on any medications that could interfere with the drug.

1351794159.0,12gwwj,Question(s) about MDMA with personal trip report which lead to these questions.,Mthrowawaydma,5,1,10,"Hello Reddit

About half a year ago I consumed Ecstasy for the first time. (Pink Dove http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=13210) and it got me going for roughly 5 hours. It was pure magic

I wanted to retain that feeling at other festivals I would be going to into the future. So I did not use MDMA or any other stimulants until 2 weeks ago (4FA). We didnt know how to dose it properly

Now last saturday I went to a rave, wanna fight? kinda atmosphere) was pretty bad and some things were going with my friends (issues etc which affected them and made me feel bad for them). but we ended up taking anyway. 

I had 1 pink dove left from a couplea months ago which I consumed at 10:30pm. I still had an orange red bull (http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=29998) and half a blue defqon (http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=29825) on me. at about 1am, I didnt feel it kick in as well as the pink dove, Just felt energetic and I talked more than usual. Ironically enough this only lasted for like 1.5 - 2 hours. During this I had a little panic attack and drank WAY too much water. At about 3am I took the last bit of the red bull and half the defqon. At 3:30 I puked, water. LOADS of it. I don't think the last dose ever got to kick in due to that because I was sober right away. Again. 

Now I've got another rave coming up next month.. And I want to trip hard at that rave. But I'm scared it wont last for the entire night again. I was actually more sleepy than some people who stayed sober all night. How on earth did I manage that? What did I do wrong? Can it be that it was just a bad night

I talked about this with a friend and he suggested pure MDMA. According to him pure MDMA is stronger than MDMA in pills, a pill which contains 100mg mdma and is 80% pure will give better results.

How does this work? How should I dose pure MDMA? And how much? (I'm ~1.80m which is errr.. 5'9""? and weigh about 85-90kg which is 188 - 200lbs). How do I make sure that I last the whole night when lets say

And most importantly.. What is the big difference between pure MDMA and pills?

TLDR; Didnt trip too well

Taking more MDMA too long after your initial dose will enhance the speedy effect of the experience

""MDMA will at first releases huge amounts of serotonin, but you may get a rush of dopamine because dopamine is able to rebuild its supply much faster (and its not as inhibited as serotonin).""

So what is better? Larger upfront dose? Re-dose about 1:30 hours in?

Assuming my connect comes through I should be getting some MDMA for a drum circle tonight. I'm not sure if it will be in powdered, but what if it comes in little rocks. Just see if i can put those in the gel cap? Swallow them whole? What do?

What about price? How much should i be paying for a single dose of 150mgs in any form?

I've also been taking lots of creatine as i'm in the loading phase for the supplement. I need to drink a shit ton of water with it
