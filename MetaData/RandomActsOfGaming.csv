1357625719.0,166535,[Giveaway] Anything on Steam that's $25 or less.,IKingJeremy,521,50,512,"Allow myself to introduce

I'm a new moderator for the subreddit here and wanted to introduce myself to the community and figured what better way to do that than a Giveaway?

Originally I thought about making a giveaway for a copy of The Walking Dead on Steam since I enjoyed playing the game so much myself

So pretty much like the Title says

I'm not going to make you jump through hoops or anything

____________________________________________________

1) **Upvote this post.**

*I receive no Karma for a self text submission

It's just common courtesy.

2) **Make a comment that includes your** 

Steam ID

A number between 1-1000

And which game
_____________________________________

And that's it.

Before you pick a number

In case of duplicate numbers

I will use a random number generator to pick the number and upload the video for all to see.

I do however reserve the right as per Rule 3 to disqualify someone who has a newer account that I suspect to just be using alternate accounts.

If this happens then I will have the generator pick another number.

The winner will be announced sometime after 48 hours has passed.

**I obviously can't enforce this in any way

A screen shot uploaded to imgur

I'll edit the text at the bottom of the post here to include that information if I receive anything.

Well

Good luck!

I have a copy of Borderlands 2 from my Nvidia card which I don't want

at which point I will pm the code to the lucky winner.

I will be using RedditRaffle to choose the winner as well.

Rules:

Sorry that some people aren't happy with the 6 month rule, I think that it's working as intended.  For the other one, It will allow for accounts &lt; 6months with high post counts to try and make things fit reddit a bit better.

 Also

**Answer:**
There is a link to follow us on the front page of our website. Put your email address and mark yourself as a follower

* How will you be able to check if we liked your page AND commented on here?

**Answer:**
When we pick the winner and announce on Facebook youll email dontcritme@gmail.com, but it's fine considering this makes it fair so that someone that actually did everything we asked actually wins.

* Can you even do this? Isn't this just exploiting us to get more people to like your page?

**Answer:**
1.  We don't make any money from this. 2. You get free stuff for checking us out and sticking around 3. I do giveaways like this all the time, but we are gamers to the core fibers of our body! If this is exploitation, then count me as guilty :)

* Yeah Id love to sign up, I don't have one, I know we can follow you on the website but how will we know if we win?

It's possible I may get second codes for Crysis and DMC.

Anyways, for this week, will go to buying one lucky person a game of their choice.

Here's the fine print.  

1) It has to be a game I can easily locate.  I'm not flying to Japan to find the original Final Fantasy 3. Also make it under $70 in American Dollars. 

2) In the thread

3) On Saturday night

If there's anything you'd rather not share with the world of reddit

Good luck

***EDIT:*** Making my first edit due to the overwhelming response this has had. Thank you all

There has been comments about the price.  The price I am paying for the game is nothing compared to how much I've saved from quitting smoking

The true reason I am doing this is simple.  My Father is a great man. A man nobody knows because he wasn't important to anyone other than us. The only things he'll be remembered for is 1) Working his fucking ass off. 2) Loving my mother. 3) Raising 3 amazing kids who are taking on the fight and standing tall with him.  I am not going to spend any less time with him because of this giveaway.  I'm not going to break the bank. He's not going to miss treatments because of this.

I have

If you don't want a game

***EDIT 2:*** I will amend the shipping date for Bioshock Infinite

***EDIT 3:*** I didn't expect as much feedback as I've gotten, so I'm hanging with Pops all day Saturday.

I promise I will read all responses again.  I can't help but reply to some of the posts/comments I've received. You all are warming my heart more than you can imagine.  I will be doing another giveaway in the near future after this one

***EDIT 4:*** Thanks for all your responses so far. I'm slowly going through them.  What this further backs up is the fact that you all, but I can only do what I can. Some people, I've even been kind enough to buy some cheaper games for. I've asked those people to post too. 

I'm sorry if I can't buy y'all games. But I'm sure everyone will understand.  It's amazing how the power of gaming can bring everyone together. Also


***FINAL EDIT - 5:*** I have chosen the person that I'm going to fulfill their request. There were a ton of stories here that have really touched me

I was at my parents earlier today

I'll probably do another giveaway shortly, please feel free to send me a message.

Just post here if you want a game. I have plenty of spare Steam and Desura codes. If you have any requests

List of games I will offer: [here](http://www.pastebin.com/mUZUftaX).

A few quick ground rules:

* Minimum account age of 30 days
* Minimum 50 karma
* Can't only post here

tl;dr: Post a joke and a game request or Steam ID. I will give away games in roughly 24 hours.

EDIT: OK, then letting me pick (both requests I can't fill and no preference). Within those groups, it'll be in a random order. If I run out before I get to your post, I'm sorry, but I will try to make as many people as I can happy. 

EDIT 2: OK, and I only left it open for 16, but if I don't close it now, there's no chance I'll ever manage to sort the whole lot out.

The winners and their picks are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1827yp/giveawaysteam_any_game_you_want_from_a_collective/c8bk82f). If someone could double check this

**Original post:**

Hey reddit!

I've done a [few](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/rkxl1/i_got_a_little_raise_today_reddit_to_celebrate_im/) [giveaways](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/usrnd/doing_a_steam_giveaway_today_reddit_give_it_a_shot/) [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/y6ia9/doing_a_30_steam_giveaway_for_no_apparent_reason/) and they were all on /r/Steam so here's one in the right sub for once.

**How will this work?**

1. Pick a fictional character - this could be someone in a movie, you can rule out the example as an entry), Austin Powers is a valid entry, but Mike Myers is not.


2. Post your choice as a reply to to this post along with the game you want and its price on steam. **Entries without a price will not be considered.** You can post a price in your local currency too and I'll convert


3. I'll get back to this thread **roughly 24 hours from now** with my own list of fictional characters randomly off the top of my head.


4. I'll work down my list and start picking winners. **You win if you've chosen the same fictional character as me, you will fight to the death. 


5. I'll keep picking winners till the collective total of games picked by the winners reaches $100.


**That was a shitty explanation. Can you give me an example?**

Assume my list of characters is - Xyz, Qwe, Rty. I'll look to see if anyone guessed Xyz. If yes, I'll pick them as a winner and if their game costs $100, there will be no more winners picked since the $100 pool is exhausted. If their game costs $20, then I'll find a second winner who can pick a game for up to $80 (since my limit is $100 today). I'll do this by going down my list and looking for Abc. Now, maybe the person who picked Abc chose a $30 game. This leaves $50 in the collective pot. I'll repeat this till there's no money in the pool left.


**Am I an a--hole if I pick a really expensive game?**


Ideally, so giveaways like this are their only shot. So you can pick whatever game you want and there's no rule on the maximum price. In short, no - you are not an a--hole if you pick a really expensive game. Not to me, anyway.



**I still have questions. Can I ask them in this thread?**


To make sure I don't accidentally see any entries here


Good luck,True,,t5_2t5mo,1360331165.0,,,t3_1827yp

1364265200.0,1b0n37,Giving away Bioshock Infinite on steam.,Gank_Spank_Sploog,152,20,205,"I have read every single post now. Took a whole lot of time. I got more responses than anticipated. Thanks for all the responses. Ive made my decision ill pm them in a bit. Thanks all.

Somewhat long story. Sorry for the sappy stuff I needed to vent.

Gaming to me has always been my escape when I was a child. Mario 3 then it became Starcraft 1. Ive played so many different games into my teens. Gaming sheltered me from a drug abusing mother and a father who worked so much to keep us from living on the street and was never there.

I moved from gaming being my shelter from reality to smoking ciggs and heavy drugs/alcohol. Humping anything that walked. Also just being a terrible downright piece of shit. 

I quit drugs about 5 years ago in March and quit smoking ciggs 2 years ago in June. What got me out of all of that was gaming. It became my go to when stress arised. Although my grandfather has cancer and is about to pass away any day now. I still am going to games even though the temptation is there to return to my past.  I went and saw him today all he had to really say was he was happy for me and proud and to just try to make others smile as often as possible and to just be there for your fellow human. My grandpa was a pivital person in my life who always took me fishing and tried to learn how to play starcraft 1 to which he kinda got good with churning out zerglings fast.he was the only man who was there for me when I needed it most.  

So thats what im doing right now. I want to give away Bioshock Infinite. I giving it away as a thankyou to gaming for helping me and also in hopes to put a smile on someones face.

All I ask is how has gaming affected you in a positive way? What game was it? Or just a good story of your life and how it changed you. 

Ill pm the winner some time tomorrow night. Thanks for your time.


Edit: thanks all ive chosen even though many should have won. I only had one copy. Basically had to go eny mini miny mo.",,t5_2t5mo,1364322675.0,Steam,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1b0n37/giving_away_bioshock_infinite_on_steam/

1367926765.0,1dutxw,[Giveaway] Any steam game of your choice valued at $100 or under,kirbzy,138,13,359,"After my Bioshock Infinite contest where I thought that for some reason it would be a good idea for people to find me the cheapest place to buy my guitar

Up on offer is any 1 steam game of your choice under USD $100

The much simpler contest rule this time is: I want you to tell me what you think the most **underrated** game of all time is. You can provide the name of the game and a brief description of why, they will be strongly considered. The only clue I will give is that I love older games, ie NES, SNES, DOS, etc. If no one's answer is anywhere near mine, anyone can definitely win!

Only condition is that your reddit or steam account must be at least 1 month old. Good luck!

*Edit: Ends 10pm 9/5/2013 AEST*

*Edit 2: Argh, Bit Trip Runner and Poker Night at the Inventory.*

*Last Edit (I hope :P): If the trade value of the winner's chosen game is much lower than its current steam price (ie. Bioshock Infinite)

**Contest is finished. Thank you to all that entered.**
I had a shortlist of 3 games where the first person to mention either of them would win. Unfortunately... none were mentioned :P For anyone who was wondering, Uniracers/Unirally (SNES). Chrono Trigger is my favourite game ever, but it is obviously by no means underrated.

Minor Prizes - (PM me if you are unhappy with the prize that I have chosen for you. If 2 people would rather each other's games

/u/ecksit1 - Kirby's Adventure (NES) - By far the standout NES game in my opinion. Also where I got my username from! You win Torchlight.

/u/Kindredspirits - Raptor (DOS) - The closest thing to Tyrian. Spent countless hours on the shareware version when I was a kid. You win Bit Trip Runner.  *game sent*

/u/RedGrobo - Rock 'N Roll Racing (SNES) - Was the first person to mention it. Bonus points for anything with Black Sabbath in the soundtrack :). For its time

**Major Prize**
I mentioned that if the underrated games which I was thinking of weren't mentioned

**/u/damonx99 - To The Moon (PC)** - Great write up and I completely agree. More of a story than a straight up game

Will be sending PMs to the winners. Thank you all for the great write ups and recommendations and I'm sorry that I could not give something to all of you for your efforts. I am going to bed in a couple of hours

1363475683.0,1afnh0,"[GIVEAWAY] UGN's 4TH Giveaway &amp; Extra Life 36H Charity Marathon - 1 GTX550Ti, Bioshock Infinite &amp; MUCH more to win! Come chat, play, lurk...you may just enjoy it. Live @ 7:30PM EST!",UnityGN,27

Over the past year and a half I have been giving away games that I want to support on my stream(s). The last one was a week ago and ended up hitting the front page because of a comment I made and I was NOT prepared for that. However I got through the carnage and never gave up and now I'm back to continue what I started with Giveaway Weekend Part 2. So many games and giveaway money were donated that I never had the chance to give away not even counting the various games I already planned on giving away such as Bioshock Infinite, Chivalry and many, many more.

The main difference between last weekend is the charity event for Extra-Life that we recently started and in only a few hours raised $278 and are Rank 8 so far out of the ~600 or so events this year. Keep it going guys! It's all handled through the website so I never have to deal with the money and it's all Tax Deductible.

During the stream I will be playing a lot of War Thunder (Incredible F2P game that deserves WAY more attention), Path of Exile, maybe Mark of the Ninja and probably some others as well. I often let the chat choose what I play every so often. 

I also interact with everyone in chat as much as I can including playing games with them because that's the whole point of streaming. Meeting people from all over the world and coming together over a common interest no matter how different your lives may be. It's a pretty awesome thing to be able to do.

We will be giving copies away all throughout the stream at different time intervals depending on how many viewers we currently have. The more people in stream the more that will be given away. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of if we have 100-200 viewers then we would do a new giveaway of at least one game every 1-2 hours. I will fine tune this once we see how this weekend goes and after some feedback from you all.

I also still have a GTX550Ti to giveaway as well but **we need your help and support** in spreading the word about the Charity and Giveaway marathon. The more people we have active the better it gets for me

I really hope to see some of you there! To those of you who may have joined last week I apologize for any drama you may have witnessed. Those who caused it are gone

So good luck with the prizes if you do stop by and thank's for giving the stream a shot! Usually you don't have to do anything to win other than be in the stream. The people most active in chat (I log everything) will usually have a better chance at winning. I don't even want you to follow me unless you genuinely enjoy the stream and what I'm trying to do. 

This time around I will most likely do giveaways for some of the bigger/more expensive games for those who donate to the charity but I will likely continue doing the majority of the giveaways as I have always done.

Stream - http://www.twitch.tv/unitygn (I make no money streaming so feel free to leave on ad block if you want.)

For those only interested in winning something here and not checking out the stream I will still be giving away a copy of whichever game gets the most requests.

What To Do To Win Here?:
 1) Please upvote this post. I receive no Karma for a self text submission
2) Make a comment that includes your Steam ID A number between 1-1000 And which game you're interested in.* 

And that's it. I will use a random number generator (random.org) to pick the winner(s) and it will be done live and recorded so you can watch it happen if so desired. (If this thread blow up again I may have to change how the winner is selected.)

Please help spread the word about this if you like what I'm trying to do. The more people the more money we can raise for the charity we have going over at http://www.extra-life.org/participant/UGN.

I apologize for the self promotion with my stream

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules
* Today I want to know one or more movies you'd recommend everyone see at least once. They don't have to be excellent movies – much like games
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age

*Done choosing yesterday's winners after two and a half hours - so far

**Edit: Wow, especially considering the fact that I haven't seen 90% of these movies. I'm not sure I thought that through...**

**Today I have to admit that I threw everyone's usernames in a spreadsheet, the string that chose Deutschbury started with D-I-T - I narrowed the usernames down to the ones beginning with D, then found the one with the second character closest to I, which made the T and the other 7 characters irrelevant because there was only one username beginning with DE). Using this method, Deutschbury and ButImUsingMyWholeAss won today's giveaway! I apologize to anyone expecting me to choose the winners the same way as the the other giveaways - there were simply too many entries, I hadn't seen most of the movies listed (but I now have a long list to watch), and I obviously couldn't sit down and watch all of the movies in the same way I could listen to all of the music entries yesterday.**",True,,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/19b654/17day_birthdaycakeday_giveaway_day_10_rage/

I've started putting names and numbers into a spreadsheet so that I can determine which entries are winners. I'll be using a random number generator, I have to go to work and do adult garbage too unfortunately. 

**Edit 2:** [Here's the spreadsheet I'm using. Just in case y'all were wondering.](http://www.editgrid.com/user/tovarishch/Giveaway_Summer_2013#)

I'm getting to it, I'm gonna be swamped. 

*Tova

Just me keeping my sanity in the third, I've already deleted some entries for having accounts that are hours or days old. 

Right

**Edit 5:** Back from the gym. I've finished updating the chart for the time being, this wasn't all of them, I actually reviewed their account histories and made a decision for each one. THIS IS HOW DEDICATED I AM TO PROVIDING YOU FUCKS WITH A QUALITY EXPERIENCE. THIS IS ALSO HOW OCD I AM.) Also some of you buggers didn't put a number within the range I provided, like 6000 something and other such nonsense, and some of you didn't write which game you wanted. I'm telling y'all now, there's no second chances, when that hour hits I'm clamping down on this so that I can get to work on acquiring games and distributing them to the lucky winners. No time to waste

Okay, I will probably only be buying the five ""expensive"" games closest to the randomly chosen integer. It's hard to put into words what I want to do but trust me, I know what I'm doing. This will make it so that as many people as possible get something fun to play for the next few months / weeks / days / hours. 

See y'all in around 2 hours! Best of luck to everyone!

1359330069.0,17e8cl,[Steam/Amazon] Several keys (PC) to give away,Schlitzi,127,18,401,"I recently bought a bundle on Amazon which included some games I don't need/want. I checked and according to the information on Amazon the activation keys should work on Steam.
The games in question are:

* Bioshock
* Bioshock 2
* Duke Nukem Forever Complete Pack
* Sid Meier’s Civilization V
* The Stronghold Collection

If you are interested in one of those games

Please let me know if you have questions.
Good luck. 

Edit 1: Please try to make sure that the number you picked is unique.

Edit 2:Boy that escalated quickly. I did not expect the demand to be so high. I decided that if the number of interested persons for one game should exceed 100 I will just draw a name from the pool. I hope that is ok for you

**Final results**
I started sometime between 6 and 7pm with sorting the list. I generated the number for each game with a [random number generator](http://www.random.org/). If several people picked that number I made the computer pick one. The winner are:

* Civ V: GagLV 
* Bioshock: vivakyuss 
* Bioshock 2: raj000777
* Stronghold: SRelic
* Duke Nukem: Maniacal

Congrats guys

For the past 3-5 years I have suffered through clinical depression. I was always too afraid to seek help or tell anybody because I thought I would be seen as fragile or weak. I didn't even talk to my then girlfriend about it. About 3 months ago I finally decided to see a doctor and was immediately put on medication and reccommended. This took about a month to kick in and has been fairly effective at taking the edge off of my previously miserable life, smart and funny. She said yes when I asked her and we should be going out soon, maybe tomorrow. My life has been on the up-and-up for a while now, I don't even have to see my therapist anymore.  
My goal for this giveaway is to tell anybody who has been in a similar situation that it does get better so get help
**tl;dr:** Depression. Done. Giveaway to help others.    

I will choose one winner, whichever comes later. I will then buy the winner whatever game (s)he chooses on Steam and send it to them. Now for the rules ... In order to be eligible you need to post the most ironic story of your life that upon looking back on is funny **OR** post a picture of your most cherished/impressive thing you own. *Pics or it's not true.*

Unfortunately, smart and pretty and that I wanted us to be going on a date and that's when she decided that she would tell me that she has a boyfriend back home.

I'm keeping track of all the games I'm interested in (and able to get) on a notepad. Thanks for all your submissions :D. I'm mostly looking for hidden gems since it's always nice to find something... different.


It's also amazing how people screwed themselves over just by picking ONLY the games they wanted AND the number. Not the 3rd requirement


the rule was to mention a game you feel is relatively unknown, which would count, also I would have no idea way to tell if you just googled title to put in without ever playing it.

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games we need your ideas! We're crafting an imaginary zombie apocalypse game. You are the main protagonist and have the help of two support characters. Who do you want by your side in the game? They can be characters from any form of fiction be it Movies, TV Shows, you name it. Let us know who you'd like to see and a short explanation of why and you'll be in the contest.

**Example:** 

*Sponge Bob and Optimus Prime*

We'd have Sponge Bob's determination and levity but also Optimus Prime's ability to be a giant robot and also a car. We could ride to the ocean and flee to a pineapple under the sea.

We'll be picking the entry that we like the best! The judging will be held this Thursday night around 7pm EST and we'll post the winner on the following Saturday afternoon when the 'cast goes live! Please see below for more info:

**Update:** Congrats to BarbaRuiva on the win! Sending you the game now!


****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast

We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation

We'll choose a winner whose submission we like the best (we're weird and have kind of a dark sense of humor

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. They will either be in the form of direct registration keys or we may ask you to message us on Steam so that we can gift it to your directly.

Of course

Last time around I followed some recent advice to store everything in my inventory so that anything I don't end up playing can be traded or gifted. Turns out I went a little overboard and bought way more then I am ever going to play. So

**Entry** is are simple. Each person can only request one game. Comment or message with the game you want as well as a short reason as to why you should get it. Winners will be picked on originality and humour. The post will be updated in around 12 hours with what games remain and which redditors won along with their reason.

1341880142.0,watta,Some things that need clarification regarding this sub and why I created it.,CobaltSmith,90,12,43,"I created this sub in the spirit of other giveaway subs. I found the confines of some of them stifling and wanted a free forum to host giveaways for the raw purpose of giving something gaming related to another *Redditor*. This site is responsible for so much good. I think it's perfectly fine to have a sub where we can give back.

I myself have been one of the lucky ones to receive incredible help. Redditors *in my experience* are pretty special people willing to help and to give selflessly without asking for anything in return. Because of that I will maintain this sub to the degree of quality that I originally meant for it. 

In that spirit users who are found out to be scammers and the like WILL be banned. The reasons and causes for these bans will vary greatly

We have fair and rather simple *for the most part* guidelines. As the creator it is my responsibility to make sure these guidelines are adhered to. I speak with my mods frequently regarding changing/updating or altering these guidelines. Every time we talk about them the point of focus is pure and simple; Fairness.

We WELCOME input regarding these guidelines so long as it can be presented in a respectful manor. This sub is not perfect

I ask if you enter that you are able to check your reddit messages at least once a day so that this does not happen.

Anyways

EDIT 1:  

Okay the giveaway has ended!  I will now be reading through all entries to determine the grandprize winner.  After that I will then run the drawing for 2nd and 3rd place.  I will PM the winners ASAP.

EDIT 2: 

I went through all the entries and there were several that stood out to me but ultimately I had to decide so the grand prize winner is:

distinctvagueness 2!!!

It was a hard choice because there were several standouts but ultimately the way distinctvagueness describes the fictional background story they made up for minor characters in a game really appealed to me.  It's always a sign you are deep into a game when you start coming up with your own stories about the game.  I am now PMing the winner for confirmation and I will be doing the drawing shortly for the remaining prizes.  

I also want to thank everyone who participated.  I read many interesting entries and a few of you got me interested in some games I knew either little or nothing about.  I just bought Crusader Kings 2 after just hearing some descriptions about it a couple days ago on here.  I'm also wanting to check out FTL when I had little interest in the game previously.  Thanks again for all the great entries!

EDIT 3:

For the second place random drawing

taotao670!!!  

I am PMing them now and once they decide on their two games I will do the random drawing for third place. 

EDIT 4:

Okay the grand prize winner has already been notified, I ran the drawing for third place which went to:

Squeedledorf!!!

I am now PMing Squeedledorf for confirmation. 

EDIT 5:

Okay,The Longest Journey, and Dungeons of Dredmor, totaling just under $20!  Steam sales are awesome!  

Now just trying to get a hold of third place winner.  

And thanks again everyone for the awesome entries!

FINAL EDIT:

I got in contact with Squeedledorf and have finally got the last prize out.  Squeedledorf chose the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic bundle for less than $5!  Awesome choice!

Thanks everyone for participating and commenting!  Hope everyone has a most excellent 2013!

Plants Vs Zombies! It's a wonderful tower defense game that takes place in your back yard. You have to defend your home from the evil zombies with a wide variety of plants and other gardening items. It's a super fun and casual game to sit back and enjoy

A few months ago the American Dental Association had a [PvZ promotion](http://i.imgur.com/tzZ5a3k.png), I went a little overboard and ended up with [70+ keys](http://i.imgur.com/f0eCvhu.png) to giveaway at a later date, and I feel they've ripened enough.

It's been a lot of fun and it's been amazing to see the growth and attention you all put into this place.

Now, and especially don't mind rule #2. Now for the large majority of posts this is absolutely no problem, but in the recent short while we've been seeing quite a few threads stray from this.

As it is, the rules are only a hassle, which is a shame. We'll gladly redirect any users that do not feel like following our rules to an appropriate subreddit for their goal, you just need to ask us. 

If you have any questions, and that our NSFW button actually acts as a button to mark the giveaway as complete. It keeps everything a bit more organized for us.

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games we need your ideas! Please pick any gaming franchise that you think needs reinvigorating. Come up with the title for the new installment as well as a subtitle. OPTIONAL (but it'll help) include a brief description of the new game and how it will stand out from the others.

**Example:** 

*Harvest Moon: Blood Moon*

****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast

We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation

There are so many ways to win! We'll choose a winner whose submission we like the best (we're weird and have kind of a dark sense of humor

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. They will either be in the form of direct registration keys or we may ask you to message us on Steam so that we can gift it to your directly.

Of course

In order to get the main wall of text out of the way on the first day, so we won't be doing that. (For those of you that prefer random drawing giveaways, on some of the days I'll also post a link or links to private SteamGifts giveaway(s) when I have multiple Steam keys for a game.) Don't worry, none of the entry requirements will be too difficult – in fact, today's task will be the most difficult of them all. I hate seeing a giveaway for a game I want and not being able to take the necessary steps to enter, so I've tried to avoid that in my giveaways. Each day after the giveaway ends and I've posted the next, I'll look through all of the entries and PM the keys to the winners. If the prize is a Steam gift copy

That's all the general information about the giveaways I can think of

Now on to today's giveaway! As mentioned in the title, and a Steam key for Uplink. [The second key for Trine is on SteamGifts](http://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/1o4gz/trine) - Metro 2033 can't be given away there, so both keys will be given away here. Today's instructions are as follows:  

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules
* Create a backstory for my Skyrim character
* State which game you're interested in.
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, only one.**  

That is all you have to do to enter today's giveaway – your entries are my birthday present! I'll pick the winner and three runners-up in 24 hours

Here I am with another giveaway

All you'll need to do is guess the correct number and use this EXACT format - failing to do so will disqualify you - you must include in your comment the number and the name of the game. (You do not need to leave your Steam ID as I will contact you directly if you win).

Everyone will be able to join this one

Whatever package -maximum of 50$- you want

All you'll need to do is write something, a drawing you did when you were bored, whatever. I'll pick out the comments that catch my attention and write those names in a hat.

In regards to that

I have read through all comments and have enjoyed them immensely; however

------------------------------------------------------------------

This giveaway will last for 48 hours and end 3:30 am (+0 GMT) on the 24th of July.

All numbers will be generated through RANDOM.ORG and will be posted here for your viewing.

The Requirements:

Steam user name- I will be checking to see if you already own the game.

Redditor of at least 2 months-- I will be creeping your posts. After seeing /r/badkarma and the banlist, but I would like to see at least a little activity in other subreddits that interest you besides gaming and/or begging for games. I won't judge you for karma whoring jokes and the like, if that's your thing, just contributing somehow will be enough. Racism, bullying, and other negative karma whoring will not do you many favors with me however. I'm sorry this may mean lurkers won't have a real chance to win, but I hate scammers and this is the best way I know of to defeat them

I would request that users in the giveaway be those like me who live paycheck to paycheck, but there's nothing I can really do except ask, as we are in fact on the internet.

That's about it. OK- contest rules:

1. you can request the game you would like to have. Gamers are finicky

2. Picking Winners- 
 I will except any story, even if they are not the game you want. If it's not yours, please note that, and also note I'm on the internet quite a bit. Whorily reposted material probably wont get a win.

Also, I will consider it. Like making models of military aircraft or making beef jerky? Post it, and go for it. I'm an avid comment reader. If you can entertain me with a cool story/song/joke, you'll be considered.


The contest will last approximately 24 hours. I get off work at about 6 pm central standard (-06:00 GMT) I will start reviewing entries then.",,t5_2t5mo,1374356067.0,Steam,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1ij1z8/paying_it_forward/

Hey guys, but 90% of the wrapper is still on there... the game is unused and technically brand new. The three games included on the disc are HD remakes of Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Anniversary (a remastered version of the original Tomb Raider on PS1), along with Tomb Raider Underworld.

This is only available to mainland UK addresses because I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for shipping. Please bear in mind I'll be asking for your address if you win so if you're uncomfortable with that

Also

I'll select two winners

**Please be sure to include in your post which of the games you would like. As long as you meet the mainland UK restriction for TRT

Before I continue; this my first time doing this so if I’ve missed something or done something incorrect please let me know and I will fix it. 

So I recently cleaned up my apartment and am throwing out a lot of stuff to make room. I’ve got a few used xbox 360 games that I no longer play and they are merely collecting dust in my apartment as I’ve lost almost all interest in playing them. I figured I’d rather give them away to other  gamers who can put them to good use. 

I’ve packed them all away into a box

Ok so here is the deal. If you live in Australia, if you wish to pay for the shipping costs then you’re more than welcome to participate. I spoke to one the mods, he mentioned something about people overseas could pay for the shipping, I could print out the docket/stamp/whatever and post it to them. Either way I’m sure we could figure something out. 

Ok so the rules are: 

-No accounts younger than 60 days
-1 Game per person 
-Pick your game and random number between 1 and 500. Try and make sure your number is unique.  
-If you’re outside of Australia please only participate if you’re willing to pay for shipping!

The games are:

So if one game has 20 votes and the rest have less, one of the 20 that voted for that particular game will win it!

I’ll notify the winner via PM in Reddit with their code so that they may apply it to their account and enjoy the game!

Now here is the problem.... I bought a shit load of multi-player games and I have no one to play with. Time to share the love. 

So with my love for games comes a love for riddles. 

Lets do this. You can only get one game a person. I will not disclose how many copies of each I am giving out. Here are the games. 

* Dungeon Defenders
* Borderlands 
* Killing Floor
* Portal 2
* Krater ( co-op in august! Games looks great! ) 


Riddle me this..... No seriously hit me with your best fucking riddles. 

EDIT: Tell me your steam ID - and / or  what game you would like!! 

EDIT: If you have any of these games and want someone to play with PM me. 

~~EDIT: Gifted a bunch of games to the point where steam isn't letting my gift anyone else - for some reason. Called my card company and they laughed ( guess the guy was a gamer? ) told me everything on their end was fine. Fuck steam. I keep getting a ""unexpected error has occurred Contact Support"" If anyone has a solution PM me and pick a game. I contacted steam support via email but nothing yet. :(~~

~~EDIT EDIT: going to leave the thread for 24 hours. I will then pick ~5 more people for games- I have given out a shit load of games hope everyone enjoys!! I can't Inventory games because my Steam account is less then 90 days old. Sorry for those who want to gift to friends!~~

* Dear Esther. Now I don't know much about this game other than you explore a world. I hope someone could shed some more light on this!

* ~~Capsized. Again don't know much about this one either

* ~~Tiny and Big in Grandpas Leftovers. The title alone sounds confusing! I tried looking at some gameplay couldn't get much info on it~~ Given to /u/EPICyazan

* English Country Tune. Looks like a puzzle game

* ~~Red Faction Guerrilla. Now a lot of people know the red faction franchise and just how great it is. This takes it to a whole different level. Everything is pretty much destructible, houses you name it! You can destroy bridges, create new paths by breaking down walls or hell even breaking down a pipeline to sneak up on the enemy! The game can give you many hours of entertainment alone just by using the sledgehammer and bring things apart. Did I mention its open world?~~ Given to /u/NoXiDj

* ~~Red Faction: Armageddon + DLC. Now unfortunately I don't know much about Armageddon only because I never played it. I'm going to be honest here, linear and I hear the story isn't relevant to the previous game at all. All though there are people out there who still enjoyed the game.~~ Given to /u/runefar

* ~~Darksiders. Now this game, the combat is very fluid. You can upgrade weapons, have different items for different situations you can combo some items with others in combat to get a higher combo. You really can't go wrong with this game at all.~~ Given to /u/jollysaintpete

As my previous post to give away Torchlight went OK I thought I'd use the same method to give this copy away.

Pick a number between 1-100 and whoever guesses the number first gets the Steam code. [Number was chosen using this site: http://www.random.org]

Please only post once and I'd rather this copy went to someone who actually wants to play the game rather than someone who's just going to sell the code.

Once the correct number has been posted I will send that person the Steam code.

This was a dozen times more difficult than I thought it would be. So many more people use this subreddit than I had expected! And only a fraction of them were joke posts or duplicates

Let me be clear: There were a *lot* of really good entries. I've been keeping up with the submissions, but first, the runner-up:

http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1k7ezg/giveawayxbox360skyrim_full_game_code_no_dlc/cbm4gvx

One of the earliest submissions, but after much nail-biting, I decided this one was truly the best:

http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1k7ezg/giveawayxbox360skyrim_full_game_code_no_dlc/cbm7n0r

The entire way the image is put together is just so perfect, the taller part of the horse being on the left but the mane and tail blowing to the right to give the image horizontal visual balance...it's just perfect in every way I can see.

I hope the rest of you who submitted excellent images are lucky enough to win your next giveaway. Take it easy!

1358473731.0,16sgah,[GIVEAWAY] Humble Indie Bundle 7 &amp; Mystery Game,TSOD,42,7,28,"Hey everyone. My last giveaway here left a bad taste in my mouth, Shank 2, and Offspring Fling. Included in this deal is a mystery game

The last giveaway I did here was for Bioshock and Bioshock 2. It took a lot of effort, make sure to capitalize a word somewhere in your post where it doesn't belong. This is the first rule. So this is the last chance I'm giving this subreddit, and I hope you can restore my love of giving away free games. I picked the Humble Bundle for a reason. It's not a AAA title. It doesn't cost much. It shouldn't be about how much or how new a game costs, but about sharing games with people who can't afford it. That's also why I included the mystery gift. You may have to do an hour's work just to get HIB7 + Dead Pixels. Or you may be getting HIB7 + the Bethesda package. You should be having fun doing these crazy things, that's what it's all about! 

**THE RULES**

Here's three albums that I really

The albums are **My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West, and Speak Now by Taylor Swift.**


Make up (like just post what's in it) a trail mix, and one candy.**

I currently have **Sleeping Dogs, and Spec Ops: The Line.** Which should I play first, and why?

Post an **adorable otter picture.**

And last


**THINGS TO REMEMBER**

The game on /r/gamedeals isn't gonna be the mystery game. Neither are the games that I've recently tried to buy from /r/gamesell. Nice try though :)

1373894412.0,1ic5vp,[Giveaways] Virtua Tennis 4 and Lord of the Rings: War In the North,evilsearat,41,8,46,"Tap X

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games we need your ideas! We're crafting an imaginary fighting game to be set in the Civilization franchise. Submit to us a historical figure that you'd like to see included on the roster and maybe a special move/combo/fatality and you'll be entered! Be sure to include which of the two games you would like at the end of your entry!

**Example:** 

*Pythagoras*

Finishing move: **Triangulate:** Pythagoras makes use of his mathematical skill to call in a precision air strike on his foe. (Virtua Tennis!)

We'll be picking the two that we like the best! There will be two winners


****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast

We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. They will either be in the form of direct registration keys or we may ask you to message us on Steam so that we can gift it to your directly.

Of course

-key for Snapshot

-key for Binding of Issac w/dlc

-key for Closure

-key for Bioshock 2

-key for Shank 2

-key for Homefront

-key for Darksiders, Company of Heroes w/ dlc

To enter I just ask the following:

-That you have been a member of Reddit for at least 3 months.

-That you have at least 200 comment karma

-that you have a steam account and are able to use these keys

-Also, basically just a happy videogame memory that happened in a December.  It can be you receiving, giving, or buying for yourself a game/system/pc/etc.  Just something that really brought you joy that you can remember from the past or something that happened recently.  I also ask that you are truthful, I don't want to see any obviously fake entries that are just trying to be crude or I may disqualify your entry.  Please be positive, thanks!  I will post with a couple of my memories as well for example or if anyone feels like reading them.

I also ask that you do not own the majority of these games before entering.  Now, I will then go ahead and do another drawing for those keys until all keys are given away.  Please be honest, thanks!

The contest will end at 12/24/2012 at midnight PST. That should give enough time for people to enter. At that point

Anyways

EDIT:  Just to clarify, does not want certain keys, then I will do another random pick.  It is not a separate drawing for each key.  Also, I enjoy all your posts so far!  Plenty of awesome comments so far and I have more to read!  Thanks again for posting!

EDIT 2:

Thanks again everyone

As I read through a lot of these entries, or his awesome name (LostRonin), or that others seem to have enjoyed his story as well.  Just something about this guy seemed very cool.  So I thought I would message him and I told him since he is so short of karma, that unless he reaches it by the deadline that he will be uneligible!

Okay so I also told him that even though I will not include him in the contest, Snapshot, Closure, Binding of Issac, Shank 2, Metro 2033, and Warhammer Space Marine.  

For some reason when I was looking through this giveaway about an hour ago on my phone

Anyways

Thanks again to everyone.  I am now contacting duqq to see if he is passing on any of the keys.  If any keys are left I will do another randomized drawing and will contact that winner.

1364884290.0,1bi1px,[Puzzle/Giveaway] Bioshock (Steam),gridster2,37,5,40,"**FINAL UPDATE:**

There were no winners. Sorry, I'll explain everything.

Let's look at the hints. The first three are fairly straightforward, the first letter of the first word is the first letter of the scrambled hint, the first letter of the second word is the second letter, the second letter of the first word is the third letter, and so on. ""Hi me"" would therefore become ""Hmie"". Of course, you may have realized the problem with this; it doesn't work with words of different lengths. If I were to unscramble ""Hmeey"" (""Hey me""), there's no clear direction as to where ""me"" ends and ""hey"" begins. This is where the keys (numbers) come in. The beginning of hint #4 says ""Keyless"". The lack of keys is the only thing making the unscrambling difficult. Hint #3 says ""The numbers are the keys."" Keys are necessary because they indicate how long each word in the unscrambled sentence is.

Let's look at the anatomy of a key. The slashes have no significance; they only serve to separate the numbers. The first number in each key represents the total number of words in the sentence. Each subsequent letter represents the length of each word, and the second has 2. ""I see you"" would have a key of 3/1/3/3: Three words, the first has one letter, the second has 3, and the third has 3.

So, since the first number tells you that there are 5 words. You no longer need that first number, so just ignore it. Now, for every letter in the scrambled text, add the letter to its respective box. The first 10 letters would give us boxes of ""Po"" , ""Bo"" , ""pu"" , ""op"". According to the key

By now

Hint #5 is only useful to people who understood the keys. As you probably guessed, tells the reader to use the ITU standard of morse code. There is nothing tricky about the ITU standard, I just wanted to avoid confusion when people got to that step. Hint #6 tells you that the first number is the only one that has any relevance to the others in the series, which is true, since it is equal to the number of subsequent numbers. Hint #7 is where I started to run out of clever hints. Pronouncing the sentence out loud would (hopefully) sound something like ""The only purpose of the morse code is the increase the entropy of anagrams."" This is absolutely true. You could find the riddle just fine without the morse code. As you can see, hints 5-7 only served to push you closer to finding out how keys work.

So

* I remember a world of grass and stones
* created from the source's bones.
* I saw a chamber of the orient grand
* in which a window revealed strange lands.
* On an island lit by beacon's glare
* the hopes of madmen and plague's despair
* a letter from a dying love
* wandered by the lonely dove
* sits a concrete cabin candlelit
* beyond the reach of watery pits.
* Inside this cabin
* Tell me

I'm holding another contest for that riddle (and Bioshock) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1cbala/giveawayriddle_bioshock_1/). The first person to solve the riddle gets a copy of Bioshock. Thank you to all who participated! Your efforts are commendable. For those of you who are interested, since I'm just a bored high schooler with a manual, but it should suffice.

Shoutouts to the people who got the furthest: mrbfowl, Baoum, and Blinkroot (and his friends!). Good job, guys!

Below is an encrypted riddle. Decrypt the riddle, your Reddit account must have at least 100 comment karma and be at least 3 months old. I will choose a winner ~~on April 7th~~ April 15 (I have to allow time enough for a few people to get this).

**HINT #1:** The riddle is related to video games

**HINT #2:** The encryption can be easily translated by hand if you understand how it works.

**HINT #3:** The numbers are the keys to the dots and dashes. Once you understand the numbers

**HINT #4:** Keyless:

* Tiahhsiinst.
* Nhtisoohsctwirisacmebled.
* Tkwhyuheieoneyllusslpcramble.
* Glouocdk!

**HINT #5:** This will only help those of you who have figured out the encryption. You should translate with the: 23/2/1/3/1/3/1/2/2/3/2/3/3/1/2/3/3/3/1/1/4/3/3/1 **|** .-./.-.--..-/--.../---....-..--.---..-.-....-..--..

**HINT #6:** The only number in each series that has any relevance to the others is the first number.

**HINT #7:** The only porpoise of the horse toad is to tin grease the hen's troppy of Anna's grahams. (As you can see

Those links contain all the information about the previous days of the giveaway. Today I'm giving away two Steam keys for Dungeon Defenders and all the DLC (many thanks to tablloyd for donating a copy!) and a Steam key for Cities in Motion. Here are today's instructions:

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules
* Today your challenge is to create a piece of art in Minecraft using only 10 wool blocks (any colors) and 10 wood blocks (any combination of planks, etc.). There's no theme for the artwork – be creative! Create whatever you wish. For those of you without Minecraft, you can play [Minecraft classic](http://minecraft.net/classic/play) for free without an account; you can press B to access the rest of the available materials, including wool. Please take a screenshot of your art and upload it to post in the comments. All the slimes jumping around my superflat world made me decide to make [this](http://i.imgur.com/4oBGpaX.png).  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age

**Compose a limerick, just follow the form (and compare to my example if you're in doubt)

&gt;Typically, and the fifth line either repeats the first line or rhymes with it. The limerick's anapestic rhythm is created by an accentual pattern that contains many sets of double weakly-stressed syllables. The pattern can be illustrated with dashes denoting weak syllables, and back-slashes for stresses:
&gt;
&gt;1) - / - - / - - /    *rhyme 1*

&gt;2) - / - - / - - /    *rhyme 1*

&gt;3) - / - - / *rhyme 2*

&gt;4) - / - - / *rhyme 2*

&gt;5) - / - - / - - / *rhyme 1

Example of a limerick I wrote about my favorite game:

&gt;The Borderlands are very vast

&gt;I kill skags with a lot of class

&gt;My graphics card died

&gt;I shut down and cried

We all think it's time to get a fresh look for the sub. Initially I was going to have this be a ""Mods only"" kind of thing. But

You can also use [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/about/alien) to help you get started as well. (Special thanks to /u/totallygeeky for finding this one)

Now you can use that as a template for the Snoo image if you like

This will be a two round event. The first round will take in all submissions over a 5 day period **(Updated ending time)** (Ending Tuesday at 12pm EST *subject to change*). Once the deadline hits no further submissions will be accepted. From those submissions the mods will choose an appropriate number of ""finalists"". From those finalists a pole will be made for all /r/RandomActsofGaming users to vote on. Whichever scheme has the most votes will be declared the winner and will be applied to the sub for the next 6 months.

***

**Requirements for entry**

* 1: BE A /r/RandomActsofGaming SUB!

Yeah

***

**What we are looking for.**

* 1: A new Snoo image that is appropriately themed for this Sub.

* 2: A new Banner image that matches the Snoo image.

* 3: We would prefer the blue scheme to remain

* 4: Try to make your Snoo and Banner images transition smoothly from one to the other.

* 5: No ""Console"" themed images please. We are looking for something that covers the spectrum of gaming. 

***

**What will be rewarded**. *Other prizes may be added later on.*

**1st:**

* [Anomaly: Warzone Earth](http://store.steampowered.com/app/91200/?snr=1_7_15__13) *Steam Key I purchased for this contest*

* Custom flair. (Image or text)

* Special mention in the sidebar until the next contest.

* Header mention for several weeks after the contest is over. (If you want.)

**2nd:**

* Custom flair. (text only)

* Special mention in sidebar.

**3rd**

That is all we can offer for now. However


That's it! I really look forward to seeing your entries and I really hope we get a lot of participation on this one.

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games

**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for entering! We're no longer accepting entries as of 6/20/2013 12:01AM. The drawing will be held tonight and the winner will be announced on Saturday

**EDIT 2**: We have our winners! Congrats to HamLis for winning Hotline Miami and to fwinest_JediThug for winning Legend of Grimrock. I'm contacting you both via private message now for delivery :D

****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast

We're only in our 14th week so far and we're learning new things every time. We still have plenty of room to improve but I like to think that a point of pride for us is our audio quality. Personally I really enjoy working with audio and, The Final Score, Video Games Hotdog, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation

There are two ways to win currently. You can tweet the pass phrase like we detail on the show and be entered into the Twitter-based drawing for Hotline Miami. Or you can comment the pass phrase to be entered to win the reddit-exclusive drawings for a different copy of Hotline Miami or Legend of Grimlock!(I just want to make sure that this does not violate the rules for this subreddit. If it does

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. (Usually they will be ones that we ourselves have picked up on sale. We like the idea of giving away games but we're not super rich or anything!)

**UPDATE** Wow... You are guys are awesome! Really good entries in here! It was really difficult narrowing it down to just three. I have said this before, definitely do it! Alright... It was difficult, but these are the winners I have come up with:

* 1st Place (Indie Bundle III + Two Tokens): [crazyrich](http://www.reddit.com/user/crazyrich) for their Booker DeWitt story (Major Bioshock Infinite spoilers
* 2nd Place (Two Tokens): [WiggerWithAttitude](http://www.reddit.com/user/WiggerWithAttitude) for their tragic love story of the NCR in Fallout: New Vegas
* 3rd Place (One Token): [RowieMonster](http://www.reddit.com/user/RowieMonster) for their love of Wilson from Don't Starve. This is a great example of when you stop caring about you and start caring for someone else in a game. It isn't about wanting to get to the next checkpoint, it is about going out of your way for a character to succeed and you put your ""wants/needs"" aside.
