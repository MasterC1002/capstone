Dear Mr. Dewhurst

I'm writing to you regarding the vote on SB5 that occurred last night.  I find it extremely disturbing that you attempted to violate state law by trying to pass a vote after the deadline for the special session ended at midnight.  Not only that but you then changed the time of the vote in the computer system to the previous day which is completely reprehensible.

You later went on to call the crowd that had assembled ""an unruly mob"".  Mr. Dewhurst, that you work for us, the people of Texas.  If you aren't interested in serving us and listening to our needs, then perhaps it's time for you to step down.

Patent and intellectual property ownership laws offer needed protection for the economic and other interests of inventors, and other creative thinkers.  These protections are also important to future growth and employment in important U.S. industries. 

Protecting intellectual property is more challenging than ever before.  Among other things, books, television, and technology. 

Online promotion of counterfeit goods by foreign entities is also a growing concern.  How to protect copyright

The PROTECT IP Act has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Although I am not a member of that committee

I appreciate hearing from you
 
Sincerely
Kay Bailey Hutchison

1361242045.0,18skgk,"Dear Garner State Park Patron in Campsite #105:  Just wanted to let you know that I put out the fire you left burning in the fire pit from the day before.  Even one day later, it took 30 minutes and 14 gallons of water.",mlhradio,127,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/18skgk/dear_garner_state_park_patron_in_campsite_105/
  
At about five in the afternoon at the end of my hike, it was a mixture of white ash, black charcoal, unburned wood and a few orange embers.  Still blistering hot so many hours later, and enough fuel inside the pit to keep it going for at least another day.  After each gallon of water I dumped into the pit, it would roar loudly, throw up a greyish-white explosion of smoke as the water flash-boiled into steam almost immediately.  The water that was not immediately burned off was left in a furiously bubbling cauldron, boiling away.    
  
I continued to pour gallon upon gallon into the pit, four gallons, five gallons.  Even though the fire pit was less than two feet across, there were still untouched dry hot-spots that exploded in an ashen cloud when I returned with the next deluge.  Six gallons, seven, eight, nine, still some embers in the unburned pieces of wood, stirring the muck around with a stick to be absolutely sure
  
Garner State Park Patron #105, dry leaves kept blowing past me and the fire pit into the piles of dry underbrush and trees at the base of the hillside starting about *six feet away*.  Even though the region is currently in a severe drought and there have been several red flag warnings for fire danger recently, I just wanted to let you know, Park Patron #105, that you do not have to worry about the gusting winds blowing embers from the fire you left burning into the rest of the park.  
  
Perhaps you were too busy when you left, it was a holiday weekend and I'm sure it was quite hectic.  But when I visited earlier today on Monday, the park was all-but deserted, perhaps only a few dozen people visiting throughout the day.  And most of those were undoubtedly down by the river, instead of the more distant non-river campsites where you were located.  In fact, in the half hour it took me to put out the fire, exactly *one* truck drove past the area.  If a small leaf had blown into the fire ring, then another gust of wind picked it up into the crackling-dry trees less than ten feet away
  
In 2011, such as NEVER LEAVE A FIRE UNATTENDED, and always put out a fire dead-cold-to-the-touch, stirring the water into the ashes to make sure there are no hot-spots.   If you ever have any questions about fire safety, Smokey Bear has some good tips: http://www.smokeybear.com/put-out-campfire.asp

Independent candidates for Senate must submit signatures equal to 1% of votes for gubernatorial candidates cast in applicable territory in 2010 general election.

&gt;Running against the man behind SOPA

[Lamar Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_S._Smith) is the House Representative responsible for SOPA. We need to get him out of office. But it turns out he's [running unopposed](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nd5gz/this_is_the_fucker_thats_behind_sopa/c3877ml) and we have five days to propose a candidate. He's in the 21st congressional district so you would need to either live there or be willing to move (I'm not sure if you have to be in the district when you file), horrible bill that's basically going to shut down the internet (go to /r/SOPA for more info on that) if we don't do something about it.

Comparisons:

**Category:** 

Sandy = 1

Galveston = 4

**Wind Speeds**: 

Sandy = Gusts of 94 mph

Galveston = 145 mph (sustained for over a minute straight)


**Storm Surge Size:**

Sandy = 13 ft

Galveston = 15 ft

**Estimated Damage Costs:**

Sandy: $20 Billion

Galveston: $99.4 Billion (adjusted for wealth normalization) 


**Warning Period for Evacuation:**

Sandy: A couple of weeks

Galveston: The morning of... 

**Death Toll:** 

Sandy (as of now) = 33-35

Galveston = 6



**This is just haunting:** The dead bodies were so numerous that burying them all was impossible. The dead were initially weighted down and dumped at sea, as of 2009. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.

Anyway, among other things it's rich history, defiance, proudness, independent spirit) but what they have in common and what's a reoccurring motif in my love of that country of yours is, once more, liberty. Being  from an ex communist, where you are able to defend yourself and your loved ones instead of being forced to depend on the Government to defend you etc etc etc....Well I'm sad that I don't live there (yet!) but I'm happy that places like that exist. 

What I would like from you is to recommend me a couple of books that would bring me closer to Texas than a wiki page can. They can be historical fiction or non fiction. 

I've read The Son by Phillip Meyer recently and loved it so I recommend that to anyone here that hasn't read it.

I have a 3-year-old daughter who is white with gray eyes and blond hair. Recently, warned her after meeting our daughter that blond-haired/blue-eyed white girls get picked on by the girls of Mexican descent. 

Is this true? If so, who will be entering into pre-K next year. I doubt it's a problem with 4-year-olds, but I don't want her to grow up being bullied, either.

I have no problem with Mexican-Americans or Mexicans in general. In fact, and food. 

Another thing that I've noticed is my daughter, smiling, and shouting things like, ""Hi, friends! My name is _______! Want to play?"" and the looks she gets from some of the kids are like... I don't know... mean. Like, ""Who is the kid? Why is she saying hi to me? Why is she calling me a friend?"" This got her instant playmates in NH. Here, it gets her dirty looks. Cultural thing? Again, black

Sorry if this is a TL;DR

**EDIT**: I'd be especially interested in hearing from Mexicans

I missed a lot of the constituent opinions (showed up late

They're looking at the [OPEN Act](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/12/27/the-open-act-is-flawed-but-still-better-than-sopa/) which they said is better than SOPA in their eyes

The office is very concerned with piracy. Cornyn is also very aware of the DNS provisions in PIPA. He's been trying to address concerns about cybersecurity and DNS-SEC. Also concerned about other aspects of the bill and how they affect free speech

Many of these concerns have been expressed to Senator Reid in a letter that Cornyn and several other senators wrote this morning. In the letter

At this point

Then there was one last question: ""Outside of movie studios and ISPs who is in favor of this?""
They said that because constituent meetings are private

I then asked

Lastly

They said that while they don't have any additional public meetings / roundtables scheduled, and arrange meetings with the Senator's staff. According to staff, Cornyn himself monitors his Facebook and Twitter accounts as well.
SO DON'T STOP PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON!

1372318947.0,1h5zzd,I've seen a lot of confusion as to why the anti-choice bill SB5 is harmful to women so I broke down the omnibus bill explaining why,maowsers93,71,26,27,"The bill (SB5) was an omnibus bill that was 4 bills rolled into one. They would:

1. Mandate all doctors that preform abortions have hospital admittance privileges within 30 miles of the procedure

2. Implement ""minimum standards"" for all abortions clinics

3. Set new (outdated) requirements for the abortion pill

4. Ban abortions after 20 weeks with only a slim SLIM exception for specific fatal fetal anomalies.

These bills would do the following things:

1. Make it harder for physicians to be able to provide abortions legally. Hospital admittance privileges are hard to get. Compile that with the fact that most hospitals aren't willing to undergo the negative attention it would draw for giving privileges to abortion providers and you would create a shortage of doctors in the field. Most hospitals, employees, or patients to the almost certain pickets and protests from pro-life groups that would result.

2. It would mandate that all abortion clinics,000+ a month. This is why all but the already 5 abortion centers that are already surgical centers would close. They would not be able to afford the upgrades. Beyond that if any clinic could afford the upgrades the estimated increase of cost of abortions in those clinics would be about 3 fold. The current cost of the average abortion here is about $420 and it would go up to about $1200 making it totally unaffordable to poor and lower class women.

3. It would require doctors administering the abortion pill to do so as set by FDA standards which is about 20 years outdated and includes doses that are three times higher than what doctors actually provide for their patients. This would also (combined with a previous ultrasound and 24 hr mandatory waiting period) force women who seek the abortion drug to make 4 separate visits to the doctor. This of course combined with the closings of the clinics would make abortions almost impossible to get for rural women in south,000 miles for the abortion. The cost of these trips combined with the new increases in abortion would make it unfordable for the average Texas woman. Beyond that there is a provision in this section that says women who seek abortions because of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy aren't really having ""abortions"" and are therefore exempt from the new ""safety standards"". Now why in the hell would they exempt the women who need the procedure the most from the new ""safety standards"" if they were worried about safety?

4. This part of the bill I find personally disturbing as I am prepared to start having children with my husband this year. Only 1.5% of abortions take place after 20 weeks and many are done on wanted pregnancies. Most women do not find out something is wrong with the fetus or pregnancy until the 18-20 week fetal scans. The fetus isn't large enough to detect structural problems before then. There is only a slim exception for anomalies that says ""in a physician's reasonable medical judgment

So,000 miles to the nearest clinic, increase the cost of abortions, and yes will also ban abortions after 20 weeks, even for women in terrible situations.

Aside from all of that the Texas Hospital Association announced that the wording in the medical abortion section would prevent their ability to provide prenatal care to women miscarrying. All of the medical associations in the state have publicly denounced and condemned these bills and asked the state not to pass them. These bills are dangerous and will not only hurt women seeking abortions but will hurt pregnant women who aren't as well.

About a week ago the company implemented a company wide change that now charges *YOU* the customer just for paying your bill!
Whether you make the payment over the phone w/CS, the collections department, even at a payment center. You will no matter what get charged $4.95!!!


Before certain contracts only allow you to pay via a certain method


Also, we're pretty much the people that call when you have a past due bill, disconnect notice, inactive account w/a balance still on it.


A lot of customers still do not know that they are now getting charged to make payments anywhere and will all be basically surprised (and giving us angry calls) once they realize that every single month of the year they will pretty much be paying $4.95 just because they paid their bill... basically $59.40 a year which may not seem like much but, unemployed people that is a *lot* of money. We are not required to advise customers of this recent change and we were pretty much told by our supervisors to not advise of this charge as there is no way ""to avoid the charge anyways"".


I didn't really know where to put this but


So in an informal way
