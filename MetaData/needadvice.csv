I guess I'll start by prefacing the rest of this with a disclaimer: I don't expect answers here, someone may have an insight I had not considered yet.

And so

My wife, so my wife insisted our daughter go outside and do something while we worked in our garden. Daughter complies and everything's peachy.

After some time, with a couple ""in flagrante delicto"". Shocked, she comes to me with this news and we spend some time discussing what should be done about this. While we both agree that there is nothing inherently wrong with sexuality, we also agree that pornography (AT LEAST) creates unrealistic impressions/expectations/role models/etc. for both boys and girls and is really not something an 11-year-old should be watching. A ""talk"" will be had.  At this time, I'm convinced it's some form of evil prank played upon her by a disgruntled classmate or some such.

Wife also mentions ""disturbing"" emails in daughter's email account. A short time ago

Her ""profile picture"" is clearly her naked breasts and is clearly taken on her own bed. I recognized the hand drawn cartoons she made and placed some months ago on the wall by her bed. They're in the background of the picture.

I just about vomited.

So, pretending to be a sex-starved, 19-year-old bi-sexual, is receiving emails from strangers trying to set up meetings and, worst of all, is responding (though never with details or any sort of agreement to meet, thank God.)

Still pretty freaked out and debating when to wake up wife and discuss this. I don't think I'm going to sleep tonight.

**TL; DR;** 11-year-old posts naked pic on sex site. Her dad is freaking the fuck out.

The story is very complicated

In 2008

The print broker, manipulated our contract, reneged on his obligations, and attempted to strong arm my dad into giving him half-ownership of the company. When my dad refused, the print broker fabricated civil charges against him and me (I was a minor during the entire dispute, had absolutely no role in the company and has never even met the broker, I was 16 at the time and had never worked for the company a day in my life) and sued us for $300, the remaining inventory

We fought him for four years. With no money for food, we lived off of donations and whatever money I could make while studying at University.

In October 2012

Luckily, am now $300,000 in debt to the evil man who ruined our lives. I did absolutely nothing. I am graduating in May with hefty student loan debt and trying to find a job in the public sector to pursue my dreams, but I am constantly stressed and anxious because I have nowhere to turn to for help. We have no money for food or rent and are running out of options.

1290627401.0,eb9ht,"I'm a scientist, got canned for uncovering misconduct...feeling completely lost here, what the eff do I do?",Iheartgogurt,65,35

I'm a research scientist and joined my current lab (or now, then the postdocs/fellows/research scientists/grad students (the category that I fall into), and lab techs/support staff.  

The minibosses are mostly young investigators, this is how one builds a career in research...you need publications to get grant funding to pay for research to get publications, and so on.  Ergo the saying ""publish or perish”)
Most of them are MDs.  My miniboss fits this stereotype to a T...driven workaholic, control-obsessed individuals I have ever met.  He *does not* like to be told that he is wrong, esp. by those lower than him on the totem-pole.  As I've learned, the fact that I have more lab-experience, and more ""field specific"" education/experience than he does, does not exclude me from this.

So basically, and being a scientist and all I thought that we would just repeat the experiments again, and/or rethink the original hypothesis and try to explain my findings.  Instead, I was told ""the experiments didn't work"" and ""you messed something up"".  This really hit a nerve; so, I went back through old raw-data to reanalyze and compare my results to those that had already been published.  Again, mine where nearly the opposite of what miniboss had originally found.  Optimistically (naively), I hoped that he would appreciate my extra effort and at least consider my ideas

Cutting down a very long story - from that point on, I really *really* loved the other research that I was working on in the lab, and everyone else that I worked with.  As delicately as I could, I discussed my situation with head-bossman.  Things had gotten somewhat better recently, when I was given more freedom to work on my own projects and those outside of the umbrella of miniboss. 

Then, they found an inaccurate date on an old CV they had on file, which I had apparently signed and given to them at some point after I was hired ""for their records"".  In their eyes technically this was ""providing inaccurate information"". They said that there was no way around this one, despite that I have references, current coworkers, former coworkers, etc. all vouching for me, I regularly sign documents without reading a word on them or giving them a second thought…lesson learned).  
Canned.  Banned from ever working for said University again. To be honest

I was in complete shock...still am, etc.  Its not like I wanted to end this guys career - and even trying to accuse him of this stuff, I thought I would have been dragged into a huge shitstorm myself.  But I also knew enough to cover my own ass as much as I could as soon as I realized what I might be getting myself into.  I had met with the university ombudsman last spring, shortly after the whole mess started, to try to figure out how to handle the ethical dilemma of ""do what’s right and report this guy"" or ""shut up and do what’s best for myself"".  They have a fully transcribed record of our conversation, where I told them just about everything at the time.  I also previously spoke at length about the situation (in confidence) with two close professors of mine, work in other departments at the same university.  I briefly reported my initial concerns to HR a few months ago, and backups of backups, who have much more experience this type of lab stuff/data analysis than I do

Soooo…Advice? Thoughts? What the eff do I do from here? If I keep my mouth shut and let the whole thing go, I got myself into this mess in the first place because I believed that *what he was doing was wrong*.  I’m losing faith in science ☹

tl;dr – I stood up for my ethical beliefs and got canned for it

So many friendships that are still developing are being cut short. I *really* like some of my friends, I've tried to hang out with these people as much as possible, but it just makes me realize that I can't really make up for lost time. Which leads to a feeling of regret.

I regret not finding a good friend group sooner. Not exploring campus more. Not pushing my boundaries more. It seems like there are a million different things I could have done or made of college

Even the end of classes was a weird feeling. Nobody said ""You're done! This university has now prepared you to go forward with your life and career."" Instead

But at the same time

What I chose to do as a career I've realized is opposite of my personality. Staying in a lab looking at the same people every day, but I'm not doing anything that I studied for.

I check test results, calibrate different precision instruments, I check orders that go out to companies, and ensure we follow FDA regulations so we don't get fined. 

Despite my education, and the additional training and added responsibilities they've put on me lately, I've seen no pay raise. Despite my ask for a promotion or change in department, there's a glass ceiling that I can't break through.

I've also thought that I should go back to school, get my degree. After I got my undergrad degree, they said, ""go to grad school."" After grad school, they said, ""get a job."" Now, 5 years after getting a job

I'm completely unhappy and don't know what to do? I keep meeting people who LOVE what they do. I want to be a part of that club too

But I also feel bad when I don't want to go to work, who don't have a job and can't pay for a house/apartment, and they don't have health insurance and benefits like I do. I'm grateful and miserable at the same time.

On top of this, I've had the benefit of being a cultured individual, but the population I'm surrounded by is full of ignorant uncultured people who I don't enjoy being around, and I have difficulty finding like minded individuals. I've applied to other jobs in different cities but with no bites.

He is cheating on my mom over these sites. (Talking dirty, planning his future life with certain girls, etc) In his correspondence he claims that he divorced in 2002. Also, I found by going through his prior transactions that he has been on at least a couple of these sites since 2008.

My mom doesn't have a job, and I know through my sister that she's now going through menopause, which has made her emotions go a bit... crazy. I don't think she could handle knowing any of this, let alone cope with fighting with my dad over it, or divorce.

For the first year everything was pretty normal, and once crawled into bed with me completely nude in the middle of the night. I have talked to her several times about specific behaviors always taking the approach that she hadn't done anything wrong but that it wasn't appropriate behavior. Besides crawling into my bed nude I considered it normal behavior for a teen girl, like she was getting a kick out of being ""naughty"". I spoke with her therapist about it and she agreed that it was relatively normal behavior for a teen in her situation and that my reactions were pretty much spot on. I don't know if they ever talked about it as I want her to have the ability to talk about anything during therapy without feeling pressured to reveal what she talked about.

We have recently moved and I haven't put her back into therapy yet as I haven't had time to find a therapist I liked. However this past few weeks things have been getting really strange. I was tickling her and she made a comment that me tickling her was the same thing as raping her

As far as I know she has never been sexually abused

As for me, but haven't had anyone click. I do have female friends that are involved in my daughter's life, but try to keep my casual dates from meeting her as I don't want females rotating in and out of her life like her mom's boyfriends did. I shouldn't have to say this, but I have never once encouraged any inappropriate behavior from her and have always kept myself as her dad and not her buddy or pal.

In the morning I wake up in a stupor with her in my bed.  Check my status, we used a condom, thank god.  It's broken, oh shit.  The night before she told me she was on the pill.  Turns out, she's not.  We rush to the clinic for the morning-after pill.  She takes it and feels shitty so I let her hang around.  She then refuses to take the second dose.  I have to sit and watch her fake take twice before finally actually taking it.  Though later she tells me she threw it up.  And she must of, or it didn't work, and now on day 2 she's clingy and won't leave.)  Calls every day.  Waits for me at my apartment.  I get people close to me involved because I don't know what to do.   

She disappears for a month.  Then turns up again with a surprise.  She's pregnant.  I am shocked.  Can't believe this.  One time, but I really can't. (Yes, I'm a terrible person.)  
She ends up getting an abortion and is apparently really stressed about it.  Three weeks go boy and a strange man appears on my doorstep asking if I know this girl.  She's at my front door in a wheelchair.  She tried to kill herself with pills, I really can't do that.  Her friend promises he's taking care of her and she is sad but says she sees the world in a new light and is working hard every day.  
Later I get emails asking to hang out and give paid English lessons

Then about an hour ago I got an email from the same friend of hers that showed up at my door.   

Apparently last night she took her own life.  
I'm in a state of shock right now.  This girl had driven me to the brink of a meltdown, but now I feel like I have someone's life on my hands and it's unbearable.

Reddit
I need some help.  Actually
I no longer have a decent relationship with my mother or father
She's 34 and still lives at home.  As a matter of fact when my parents moved into another house a few years ago, and have so for the past 6 years.  When I thought about trying to go back to school and move in their basement so i wouldn't habe to work full time to pay my mortgage, I was told I couldn't.  That's right, I can't move in with them to try and better myself, but she gets to live there rent free, and doesn't help out with any bills.  My mom cleans her appartment, washes her clothes, my sister walks across the porch into their house and watches TV

My parents are losing their minds.  She has a ""job"" at the family business, but she never does.  She's never had to have any type of responsbility and my parents won't kick her out because they know she will go to her grandmother's (our mom's mom) to stay, and she will not tell her no.  She has never told her no.  In addition to living at my parents' house rent free, she also has her $120 cell phone bill paid by my grandmother.  I pay for my own.  She has no bills to pay for.  All she basically does is order clothes online and get manicures and pedicures.  This isn't even the worst part yet.  

She has ordered thousands of dollars of clothes online,000 worth of stuff, all at different times.  My grandmother has had to change the numbers probably 5-6 times and each time they ask if she wants to press charges and each time she says no.  She tried to open up a charge card in my mom's name to order more clothes and my mom actually did call and tell them she didn't authorize an account to be opened in her name and so they closed it.  Well, my sister then tried to do it again and it got declined.  

Recently

A lot of the reasons for my parents and grandmother not doing anything to try and stop this, at least in spirit.  They have no hope of anything getting better.  I asked them what else she would need to do to make them wake up and realize that they have to do something drastic to stop this or it will continue, and their answer is ""I don't know.""  They aren't the same people they were years ago.  My mom, who used to be a pretty person to be around has probably aged 15 years in the past 5 years and is just a shell of herself.  She calls my mom probably 25-30 times a day and orders her around.  My mom can't get anything done around the house because she is constantly answering the phone.  My dad cries all of the time because he's so miserable and sleep deprived.  He says many mornings on the way to work that he feels like he could doze off at any moment.  She calls my mom a bitch daily and tells her stuff like that she wants to push her off the top deck of their house when they are arguing.  She told my grandmother the other day that she would drive her car through a tree if she didn't get the clothes she ordered.  

She also can't keep a relationship.  The last real relationship she was in ended because of how she acted and he didn't even know the majority of it.  She would do things like cause a huge scene at Thanksgiving dinners because the football game would be on and her boyfriend was supposed to turn his head if cheerleaders were on TV.  If he didn't she would check to see if he had a hard on.  He had to promise her he wouldn't watch TV if he was home and she wasn't there.  This was about 4-5 years ago

I've tried to intervene.  I've gotten packages of stuff she has ordered and sent it back so my grandmother would get a refund.  Even when I try to do these things, that it makes it easier on them.  If I go visit my parents and I lock all of the doors in their house so my sister can't come over and cause a scene, my parents go and unlock them because they say she will beat on the door or break the glass out, which she actually has done before.  Surprise, no cops were called for her vandalising their property.  

At this point, can I alert the authorities so maybe she can be charged by the state?  What she needs is for someone to discipline her.  She's never had that.  My parents use the excuse that ""she old enough to know right from wrong"" which is true, but she's also conditioned to be this way, as there have never been any true reprecussions for her actions.  She has most people fooled.  Her ""friends"" wouldn't ever beleive that she acted this way.  She puts on a front around them and actually has a lot of them fooled into thinking my parents are awful people.    
What I've told in this post is probably close to 20% of all the stuff she's actually done.  I just felt like it was getting long-winded and felt like it was enough to paint a picture of the situation.  

Does anyone have any advice on how I can make this better?  I know that my parents are to blame for their lack of discipline

I just know we need help

1292509912.0,emtfr,"So, I admitted to myself and my close friends that I am an alcoholic today. The thing is, I don't know if I should go to AA. Please read on. (Long as all hell, 4 years of shit I need to get off my chest)",,4, here I am, there is no question that I cannot indulge in it anymore as it has hurt me and the people around me. It has ruined so much. You'll see what I mean

I'm 22, and not in school quite yet. I started drinking relatively late, at 18. This was January 2007. I had a deal with my parents that if I didn't drink or do drugs until 18 they'd compensate me handsomely. Fast forward to 18, I stick to my word and come out with about a grand and a macbook courtesy of mom and pop. I buy a quarter pound of weed and sort of got into selling (more on this later), and hit the sauce with my buds virtually days after I had turned 18. I was in the middle of grade 12 at the time, but I only had one class that last semester and it was english which was no problem. I loved getting drunk. I loved everything about it, it made me sociable, etc, but opted to not return to post secondary due to feeling like I missed out on the party years of highschool

My first major fuck up drinking was me getting arrested for graffiti and possession of prohibited dangerous weapon (brass knuckles) while completely hammered. I woke up in a holding cell covered in blood, got tackled by a cop on foot, skinned my knees down to the bone, and called a cop a pig which contributed to a fair degree of brutality on their part and no lenience with the law. I had thrown up on myself in the car ride to the station, and they let me sober up in a cell. I ended up having to pay a $5000 fine and another $500 to a charity of my choice. My mom footed the bill, and that put tremendous strain on our relationship and further provoked me to drink because I was so disappointed with myself.

My parents divorced that summer, and that's when I started really drinking to kill emotional pain and murder my memories. My mom and dad used to be my best friends, but when divorce time came they tried to leverage my brother and I against the other parent, so I coped by always being drunk. My weed business supplied me with the money to go boozing, and put me right into the thick of the party. Everyone wanted to go for drinks, everyone wanted me around, and the last place I wanted to be was at my apartment with my dad listening to him tell me how much he hated my mom. I mean, I was popular, and the other went to post-secondary and didn't have the time or inclination to go out drinking and hear me out. I felt very alone

By that time I was stacking enough paper between selling dope and working part time to move out, not knowing why, just ridiculously unhappy. I've always been an introspective person, and kinda suffered from moderate depression, but I had never been that down to that level. I just hated everything, especially myself. I didn't like the person I'd become. I'd abandoned a lot of friends in favour of selling weed and party people, and sacrificed relationships with girls because I didn't have the time. All I had time for was selling and boozing, my friends that I had lost

I eventually had a falling out with the girls that I lived with and moved back in with my mom. When she picked me up she nearly cried, maybe 3 or 4 times over the entire course of my 8 month stay in that house, due to the divorce and me being preoccupied with my retail jobs, illicit or otherwise. My mom sensed that something was wrong but knew better than to question me because I was so volatile and irritable if I wasn't stoned or drunk. I attempted to continue selling weed, but my mom caught onto that pretty quickly and served me with the ultimatum of quit or leave, and that would mean leaving a place that was rent free, stocked fridge, changed my number, and booze was diiiiirt cheap. This was the beginning of the end

I was forced to move out again in March 2009 due to my mother not being able to take my lifestyle. I was legitimately drunk every day. I was mean, but by the end I'd be fucking wasted. It cost me nothing. Everyone around me drank. I felt awesome. My three rules were this, if I could afford it, it's not affecting my health, and my relationships weren't failing, it wasn't a problem. I was so deep into denial that I couldn't see I had broken every rule long ago. Working in the bar industry, I predictably got into coke and MDMA. I wouldn't say I was addicted to either substance, take a pill

Late that summer, he barely knew this woman (lo and behold she turned out to be a psycho, but that's beside the point), and she treated my brother and I like such shit. I had lost him, and for a time I did, but not because of his relationship with this woman, because I just spent every waking hour I could getting wasted. I was now at the point where I was not speaking to either parent except for occasional small talk when I so happened to see them in public, get this, and I ended up breaking a mirror in the washroom with my fist in a rage. I cut my hand up really badly and got written up and had to replace the mirror

It was fall 2009 that I moved into a particularly self-destructive environment filled with primarily drug addicts and dealers. I lived there a month, and stoned for that entire time. This is when my coke habit kicked into high gear. I moved out of that house into what will be known as Bad Haus. Around the same time I met a girl known as Big Red, or BR for short. BR was older than I was at the time by 5 years, and I thought ""Score!"". Things were good until my birthday at the start of January. The night previous to my actual birthday, I got really drunk and fucked up with my friends, and the hangover was such that I was half an hour late for dinner with my parents, and BR. This was her first time meeting them. She was livid with me, instead ordering enough booze to get me drunk by the end of dinner. I worked things out with her, so I did what I always did and got annihilated. The shine of inebriation had worn off long ago

I make a trip out to the olympics immediately after Big Red and I part ways. I spend 5 days in a drunken stupor, and miraculously coming out unscathed, but putting my friends in very real danger multiple times. Again, I'm a drunken idiot.

My bosses had noticed my attitude and work ethic steadily declining, getting drunk, but keeping my attitude out of work and remaining employed. I was known as a miserable bastard, and was the pariah of the staff. I went to bed and woke up hating everything. Even when I was drunk I hated everything. I added more and more drugs into the mix, eventually getting up to at least 4 or 5 substance nights, most nights. Anything to kill the hate-speak running through my head. In March 2010, my friend and roommate had a massive heart attack after a night of us partying. I had to bring him to the hospital while I was still fucked up too, but at the cost of always being afraid of dropping dead if he ever exerts himself a lot. I moved back into my mom's house a few weeks after. I didn't really touch drugs after the heart attack incident

Fast forward to June, my position, and everything I had worked so hard for over the past year and a half. I'm stuck back at the bottom of the totem pole, and I'm bitter, I couldn't understand why. Of course, now I realize that it was because I was such a degenerate drunken drug addled bastard that I was a liability, but in classic denial I blamed others and never questioned myself. Two days before the opening of the new bar, and I'm pretty drunk. I had been drunk since before arriving to work, or stoned stupid. I then use myself as an example, and more or less said fuck it. 

My cousin's wedding is in Seattle, calling my cousin's new father in law a republican sack of shit, a bigot, and a warmonger, and immediately after storming out with a 12 case of stella to drink by myself in the car. My mom finds me passed out on the hood covered in beer and yelling in my sleep. I wake up with the second worst hangover of my life, and face disapproving stares and whispers from my relatives at breakfast as I not at all discreetly make 5 minute trips to the washroom to heave, which I later learn is audible throughout the entire restaurant. I hear from my mother that my cousin thinks I ruined her wedding

A week after I get back I meet up with my best friend of 10 years. He's a nice guy, timid, doesn't drink that much and doesn't like to. I always enjoy his company because he listens to me. On this particular night, I walk him home after a rowdy night at the bar. We're close to his house, and he stops me and says he needs to say something. I am of course receptive, he is my best friend. He continues on to tell me that he doesn't want to be friends with me because I have turned into someone he despises. Without another word, he walks off. I haven't talked to him since. Later that night I self-medicate with booze and a bunch of MDMA, disappointment

I apply for and get another bar job, as the new bar I'm employed at is direct competition for their flagship pool hall. I say I'll consider it, and a few days later decline based on the fact that a paycheque isn't worth my reputation. However, I have a very big mouth, especially when drinking, and since I'm always drunk, I always say shit I shouldn't. So

I spend a week getting mangled, but not even near as wasted as I was about to get. I knew people in vancouver, and they invited me out. I black out at 9:30, I wake up at 10 the next morning and I have no idea why my family won't look me in the eye, other than suffering from the worst hangover I have ever had. I had apparently broken into the hotel with my friends, stolen furniture, harassed the front desk clerk and threatened to ""maul [her] with my penis"" if she didn't give me an extra room key to replace the one I had presumably lost drinking that night. I find it almost immediately after this exchange, being cold shouldered

Fast forward to mid october. I'm selling coke and MDMA because I can't (read: too depressed and self-absorbed in a pool of pity to) get a job, the one that had moved to a new city years ago to return this year, so I'm like fuck it, why not. There, I am introduced to a girl named we will call Brucie. The night progresses and I get her number, not really thinking anything of it. Later that night I'm cruising facebook and I see that she's added me. She starts chatting with me and before I know it she's in my bed. The next month rules. She becomes the catalyst for me stopping selling drugs, enroll in school, and tells me that she can't do a relationship. I won't lie, and making all the right moves. It would have been one thing had it just been casual from the start, and start going crazy. I had done everything right with this one

Reddit, early Wednesday. Obvious for you, the reader, but I have lost my closest friends, pushed my family away, disappointed everyone, lost 3 girls, destroyed my health and my sanity, and I'm not blinding myself anymore. I know I need to stop drinking. I don't have the desire to anymore. I have lost so much that mattered to me that I don't know what to do, I drink to make myself feel better

TL; DR Numbered by paragraph:

1. Started drinking and selling weed at 18

2. Get busted for graffiti while wasted

3. Parents divorce

4. Moved out with party girls

5. Move back home, regularly, depression worsens.

6. Get into coke and E

7. Dad marries new woman

8. Meet new girl, drink. Start hating myself more.

9. Go to the olympics

10. Am threatened with termination at work for worsening attitude and self-destructive behavior

11. Bar I'm working at shuts down

12. Ruin cousin's wedding by being a drunken asshole. Depression and self-loathing skyrocket

13. My best friend of a decade tells me we're not friends because I'm a drunken piece of shit. Drink more.

14. I get another job

15. Embarrass myself and my grandparents at their 50th anniversary. Get shunned by that end of the family.

16. Selling drugs, she has a freak out and I go crazy and start drinking, push her and friends away, am left with nothing.

1295629624.0,f6kfe,wife left me and secretly left the country today with my three boys against my will. what to do now?,mayotteiru,38,3,31,"my wife and 3 sons and I are all US citizens. we left the US 18 months ago for me to take a job teaching English in a foreign country. we love this country and everything about it, and there is something magical about their continued innocence and naïvety in not coming into contact with the complexities of the world because of the language barrier that still exists

i'm not perfect by any stretch but I am willing to admit my shortcomings, or abused her or my kids.

I believe that due to childhood sexual abuse (grandpa), her shitlist against me is pretty long.

all 3 of her sisters (also abused) have been divorced (one of them is on her 3rd marriage), with the underlying implication being that by staying with me she is weak. i have read emails and text messages that they have sent, and are extremely negative to her about me and about our relationship.

after we came to this country, after declaring that she was a lesbian and leaving her own husband to more fully commit to being a lesbian. she is divorced now, raising the kid on her own, shacked up with another single mom she met at group therapy (i doubt she is paying rent), and supporting herself on financial aid she receives as a student and foodstamps she receives from the state. my wife went to visit last summer and laughed how her sister was buying groceries for everyone in the family with her foodstamps.

wife took the boys and left me to live with friends a couple hours away from our apartment after we got into a fight on new year's eve when I asked her if she could please be nice to me and stop being angry at me.

she came home two weeks ago to tell me that she had decided to leave the country with the boys because she couldn't stand being with me

my mom absolutely adores our boys. she has come to visit us here twice. is constantly calling to talk to each of the boys, and begging us to get the boys on skype video conference at every opportunity. she cherishes her relationship with the kids.

my dad is a little standoffish with our family because my wife suspects that he molested me as a child

my wife has always felt neglected by her parents as an adult. she had to drop out of college her sophomore year because she couldn't afford to eat, she rarely if ever spoke with her parents on the phone or via email. weeks and months would go by. their relationship with our boys was even more distant and communication less frequent.

after coming here my wife started a blog that she put hours and hours into maintaining, and give unlicensed (and no college degree) relationship counseling and therapy, but she never seems to have time or motivation to want to help my wife. bawling, my wife got on the phone to voice to them the hurt she felt from their neglect before they finally started making a random comment here and there on her blog, and a computerized birthday card for the boys, not even hand-signed. This was less than a year ago.

So the wife wants to go back to the states, we would be long divorced.

i told her that i really want our marriage to work, but that if she wants to take the boys with her, I can't support her in going to live anywhere near her sister and her parents. they tell her that us moving to japan, and me trying to ""isolate"" her from them is an indicator that I abusive of her. i can't imagine the nasty and damaging things that would be mentioned in front of my boys about me and about our marriage. plus, I believe that there will not be any encouragement to heal herself by working out her relationship with me instead of running away from it. they want her to be ""strong"" by leaving me.

she suggested that she could take the kids and live with my parents, and in the town where my wife went to high school, on the other side of the country from her parents and that one sister. she told me she would be willing to go and live there. it was her idea to begin with.

i had a difficult time with the idea of her leaving me at all and ending our plans here in this country permanently and taking the boys away from me at all

my wife was to bring our boys back to our town here in the foreign country for the boys to attend their last day of pre-school today (friday morning) to say goodbye to their friends and to go to a farewell party the school was throwing for them. she was to drop them off there at 10AM this morning

she won't answer the phone if I call her, so I know that it was on and she was just not answering. Went to get money out of the ATM to pay our rent and some bills shortly thereafter (today was my once a month payday), and she apparently had cleaned the account out almost completely (hit the maximum daily withdrawal limit which is quite high in this country). Called and found out that she had checked out of the hotel she had been staying at in the town a couple hours away where we go to church.

I found out tonight at 7PM that she took a train to the airport with her friend this morning (10 hour drive, and got on a plane back to the US one week early. My contract doesn't end here for 6 months. She didn't even let me say goodbye to my boys, or give me my last weekend with them after not having seen them hardly at all for the last 3 weeks since she left our home.

She's in the air right now still, since I have no ability to do anything about it.

Before any of this happened today, but to also be able to see my boys and to go to therapy together with my wife and get our marriage back on solid ground before coming back to this foreign country again to fulfill my contract. I asked my work if I could take a ""mental health"" leave of absence for a few weeks and they said yes. My contract says I can take up to 60 days of consecutive sick leave if I need it. So I asked my mom if she would buy me a ticket and she supported the idea and did it on the condition that I would find somewhere else to stay, and that I would not bring any contention into their home. Everyone I have talked to has agreed that if I want the marriage to work, I should be there and willing to go to therapy together with her, so that's what I was planning on doing.

Her leaving today kind of threw a wrench in the works. It may or may not have been spurred yesterday by me hacking her secret email and facebook account to confirm my suspicions about her intentions to not actually stay with my folks

She has not called my parents to tell them she changed her flight

So that's where we're at. If she does go to live with my folks like we agreed, and they will be pushing her very hard to serve me divorce papers and take full custody of the kids in the process.

1370726879.0,1fy35j,My mom has a cleaning problem,105647382910,35,2,10,"Hi everyone

So here's some background. About 20 years ago, but he was a carrier of the virus for a number of years. It was no big deal, but my mom read up on the disease and spoke with doctors, and she gradually become more and more paranoid. 

I'm 18 and my sister is almost 16, be very careful if he accidentally cut himself, etc. As the years passed, my mom just got more and more obsessive about cleaning. 

If we rode in his car, we'd have to change our clothes. If he kissed one of us on the head, we'd have to wash our hair. We'd have to avoid sitting on the same chair in the living room or at the kitchen table. She tries to keep ""our"" food away from ""his"" food in the refrigerator or on the counters. We can't sit on the steps outside of our door or the deck in the backyard. If my dad leaves in the morning before she wakes up, she'll clean the handles on her car door in the morning before leaving if for some reason he may have touched them. It's gotten to the point where we just stay in our rooms where it's ""clean"" so that we don't have to deal with any trouble or stress her out by giving her more work. 

If we leave the house for a while, light switches, counters, and basically anything else that he might have touched. 

My dad found out a few years ago from his doctor that he's not even a carrier anymore, but he doesn't know the extent to which she goes. If he sees her cleaning he just assumes she's trying to keep the house clean. It's not even real cleaning to be honest. Our house is a bit messy (who's isn't?), but clutter will not bother her. She obsesses over this imaginary sense of ""dirt"" that my dad leaves behind on everything he touches. 

Now my mom is a very intelligent woman. She graduated with her master's degree from one of the best universities in the US. She understands how things work so it's clearly a problem. I'm almost certain it's OCD. 

Aside from this, and have a pretty healthy relationship in general.

As a kid, and stopped accepting it as the norm. Because it's not. I can understand still being cautious about sharing food/drinks and being careful with blood, but the rest is just not normal. I worry very much for my mom's health. In 20-30 year's time, when she gets older, she's not going to be able to run around the house cleaning after him. Regardless, it's no way to live. Her stress levels are through the roof sometimes and it's slowly wearing her down. I obviously love and care for her very much, and I've told her it's a problem, and I want her to be better

I just don't know what to do to help her realize that it's an issue. Recently, and telling her that she has a problem. Not in an aggressive way, but in a way that's different from how I used to simply just obey her when she told me to wash my hands if I touched something ""dirty"". But she doesn't take me seriously. 

If anyone made it this far

Thanks

He was unplanned and unwanted, like I am just imitating what I think a mom is supposed to act like. I am an extreme introvert and I feel like my son rapes my attention all day every day and I resent him for it. I do hit him sometimes. I put him in his room often. I am ashamed at the way I am and I do love my son and do want whats best for him and I am coming to realize that may not be with me.

I don't have reliable family to offer me an occasional break or anything so I am literally alone with this little demon 24/7.

I need advice.,landlordhell,33,4,18,"I just moved into a new area of the state a little over three weeks ago and my landlord refused to repair and hookup the stove, it didn’t work. 

When I expressed these concerns in an email to my landlord, her and her son verbally attacked me and refused to leave my apartment until I was out (police were notified on this account), my tire was punctured and flatted by a blunt object to the sidewall (police report on file) and false accusations that resulted in me being arrested, a restraining order placed upon me, and now the locks to the unit are glued shut so that I cannot enter the unit. 

She also placed a two day notice to enter unit on my door so that she can now go in and make repairs. But what is the point now? At my arraignment I was instructed by the public defender not to say anything but ""not guilty."" 
I was instructed by the court not to go back to the unit and not to call my landlord. She and one of her friends have sent multiple emails to my work email address threatening to get me fired by sending multiple background checks of other people with same name to my employer. 

They made it very clear in emails that they wanted me out of the unit, I am on unpaid administrative leave, and I am homeless and staying with a friend. My son is living with my mother in another part of the state because I am unable to leave the county.  I cannot even get into the unit to get my clothes. 

Last week before the charge against me I tried to file harassment charges with the police but they said the malicious behavior is civil and immoral but not criminal. I cannot prove that they punctured my tire

After that

After my tire was punctured I sent my son on a train to stay at my moms until this blew over.  I sensed danger and did not want him around if something happened.  Things started to die down when I heard nothing for a few days so I sent for my son to come home.

I was awaiting a legal eviction so that I could tell all this to a judge and possibly have her return my deposit so that I could rent another place. My son was only home from one night when on Sunday evening at 9:40PM two women I have never seen before knocked on my door and served me with a 20-day eviction notice. I said thank you and shut the door. Seconds later my son, and then something hit the wall. We ran outside to see what was going on and the parking lot was empty. Puzzled, we went back inside the unit and the friend’s grandmother picked him up. 

A few minutes later, silver blade, black handle, and that was probable cause to arrest me. 

They took my 17 y/o son into custody and then to a local foster home because I have no family or friends within two hours driving distance. I spent three days in jail before being bailed out yesterday. I live in a city that is in the top ten for gang violence and violent crimes. When I was in jail they put me in solitary confinement for 24 hours then into the the counties most violent shark tank.  
Now the locks are glued shut on the unit and I may actually be terminated from my job. 

I am a social worker and I am responsible for 317 employees in 15 counties. I have no crimes against people in my background

Here is where the problem is compounded. I had cancer about five years ago and at that time I was working for my current employer part-time and a college part-time. Because I was part time I had no medical insurance and ran up some rather large medical bills. Because of that I don’t have great credit and $800 a month is coming out of my checks to pay them off. I did not have the financial resources to move right away

The landlords son who happens to be her maintenance man that aided in the harassment has an extensive violent criminal history as well as drug charges

Because I was going to be moving again shortly, but who cuts someone and sits the knife on a craft table awaiting police to come and find it?

I am still in shock and find myself in a position where I am unsure how to get the help I need due to my financial issues. I have saved multiple emails back and forth where sthe landlord refused to make repairs

My son and I can pass a polygraph with flying colors and I am absolutely positive that the two women who are accusing me of assault

I apologize for the grammar and the panic stricken email but I have been very ill at the thought of losing my life over a lie and a cruel landlord. I have been ill and unable to eat for the past four days. Everything that I eat comes back up. The guards forced me to see a doctor when I was incarcerated and they had to give me two separate shots of anti-nausea medication as well as an anti anxiety medication. I can’t eat or sleep and I feel like I have done everything I can and still there is no hope.  I have recently learned that there are two superficial scratches on the alleged victims shoulder. During my incarceration I had my head slammed into a wall

This was me three years ago. 

Since then I have learned, what I did eat included hot dogs, pizza and pasta. I got a second job at Sears auto center, I changed tires and did oil changes. Doing this for 80 hours a month put an extra $200 in my pocket, yeah it sucked (but I did learn how to balance tires which is new to me). I worked really hard at my day job and got a really crappy raise. I went out and found a better paying day job and quit both of my other jobs. I made deals with debt collectors to pay off some of my credit card debts for less. I also paid some debt collectors the full amount to try and salvage my credit, I don't think it helps, my credit is still abysmal. I got caught up on the rest of credit cards I still owe on.

Hang in there debtors. Get a second job, you probably can. Sell everything that is worth any money. I sold my TV solely so I would get less calls from debt collectors.

I have to say that 90% of my friends never contact me first or invite me anywhere. They'll text me, it's all laughs, smiles, conversation, and fun (actual fun, really! nothing awkward, they're not pitying me, after that when we're no longer in the same place, people they've met at the same time as me

Now

1) when I was younger and more ""upset"" about the issue (read: immature) I used to call people out about it. My best friend of seven years went off to college and completely dropped me from all communication; when I told him how I felt about it, there's no grudge between us or anything, but he still does it. I NEVER hear from him, even when I try to ask about his accomplishments, what he's up to, or just bring up old inside jokes.

2) then, I saw you and [my roommate] and others went to [restaurant] yesterday. I love that place, I'd love to go next time!"" They'd say stuff like, ""Oh yeah, it was completely last minute. I'll tell you next time."" Then, they'd continue to go and do things like that over the ensuing weeks and would never once tell me.

3) Lastly, I just won't try anymore. I won't be impolite, but I just won't say anything or act like I notice or care. I figured, if they're really my friends, they'll contact me sooner or later. Wrong. The reverse has happened. The people I've tried this with drifted away faster than ever, and I haven't heard from them in years.


So, I can't really drop them all at once. Plus, when we DO happen to be talking or hanging out, we enjoy each other and they really are my friends. You might also say for ME to invite them somewhere, but as they rarely contact me and barely keep up a text conversation unless I pull their weight, I don't feel comfortable doing this just yet.

Any advice? :/ THANK YOU.

1356376800.0,15dweb,Younger brother in 7th grade doing drugs for almost 2 years and parents don't give a shit,tsundrea,43,14,18,"This is somewhat relevant to know first


My brother just turned 13 about 2 weeks ago. He's been a trouble child ever since he got an xbox in 4th grade (I know, expelled at BOTH middle schools in our city, and as a result, has been expelled from the school district in the city we live in (small city). To top it off, he's also a spoiled brat and the parents pretty much give him everything he asks for. 

Examples:

* Got a laptop (at least $1k)

* We have never owned a game console before, but bought the 360 instead because he went insane in costco. 
* Asked for the kinect when it came out
* THREW A TANTRUM FOR THE ITOUCH A WEEK AFTER GETTING THE KINECT (???)
* oh man

He has no understanding of where money comes from. Because my mom has a steady job at her company, and he somehow sells stuff  (THAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO) on craigslist to make a shitton of money too.  

His grades are rock bottom and he can barely spell

Not to mention, and on the rare occasion he doesn't, he comes up with some equally BS answer. Worst of all, parents also let him do whatever the hell he wants. Go out at anytime, doesn't control when he comes home, where he goes, or what he does.

**In short

Earlier in January, and using up data my mom never had in the first place for watching youtube videos and using fb. *Punishment?* Mom asked him to not do it again, but let him keep the phone. You can guess that he didn't learn. 

My older sister, really groggy and with really red eyes, as opposed to when he was younger, he used to be proud that he could wake up at 7am before everyone else without an alarm. 

**Trust me, weed, marijuana, WHATEVER.**  This was during a dinner outing (I wasn't there), but they asked him, he denied, sister said ""Ok,"" yknow from CVS pharmacies

The next morning, but our mom just stupidly believed it. After this event, parents continued to let him go out and do whatever he wants, whenever. 

A couple weeks after that, all inside a bigger ziploc bag. I didn't know what to do, so it put it in a bigger plastic bag and put it in the garage. I wanted to call the cops on his ass so badly so he's go to juvie and maybe learn his lesson, but I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do because the parents keep guarding him. 

To this day

I have no idea if he's doing any more than just smoking weed

He's got a different phone by now that he can't really abuse. Last night he left the house 2am. He tried to sneak out when I was on the couch watching a movie. I heard the door close real loud

I locked all the windows and doors so he couldn't get in because he typically never has keys, with keys by his side to get in the house... and his phone. 

I grabbed his phone and looked at his messages. He's got 3 conversations; 

* 1 talking about some sale on craigslist
* 1 saying ""i gave a guy your number hes got weed"" and ""he's got a pound of some fire"" 
* and the last one talking about sneaking out and meeting at a mcdonald's nearby at 2am to exchange something for $150 ~~which I can only assume to be weed~~ [[EDIT]]: I reread

I have no idea where he gets money, EXCUSE ME. I'm over here struggling with paying for almost all of my things, taking care of myself with no income and relying on my own scrimped up savings I've had since 6th grade. 

I don't know when he got back, they would try to solve it on their own, but they can't. If I went to police, I don't know if it would be of any help because I've had bad experiences with cops. Not because I'm a bad kid or anything, but them wrongfully accusing me of things,  but that's a completely different story. 

I'm currently holding onto his phone right now and he doesn't know I know (yet). This is cheesy as hell, be my guest, that's your choice, BUT MY BROTHER. Honestly, I couldn't care less about him, but he deserves punishment and this is just ridiculous.

First thing they started to do was 'cross-train' me for a position I was not hired for. Apparently

Now

Michaels enforces all employees to use a sign-in paper if you are asked to start your shift earlier than 5 minutes prior to your scheduled shift and to use the sign-in sheet if you are more than 5 minutes late clocking out. I am Always early clocking in 5 minutes before my shift and almost always asked to stay later than my scheduled shift by management. Michaels has a time clock

My first paycheck seemed short. I didn't ask questions

2 weeks go by and within those 2 weeks I am asked to stay later more and more. Which basically forces me to use the sign-in sheet to clock out more often. 

I've done the math on my hours after receiving my paycheck. I've worked 38 hours and I am only getting paid for 24!

I do not feel comfortable approaching the store manager because I think she is doing this on purpose to get a bonus. You see

How can I prove that I am missing those hours when all I can go by is a sign-out sheet that has hand-written information?

- She's been arrested numerous times for assault

- She is constantly high. I've ran into her a few times while shopping, and this is why I no longer associate with her or any of them.

- She has a daughter that her mother now has custody over. She basically lost custody because she left her daughter unattended at a friends house, except she was around 17 at the time and they thought removing the child was the best solution without implementing jail time.

- One of my friends dated her for a while

Okay. I get it, more power to her. But what *really* pisses me off? She added me on Facebook not too long ago, and (of course) I was snooping through some of her posts.

Almost every day, or about how she got x amount of y from [insert horrible name to call some old person here].

It really pissed me off, and the yellowpages listing. So now I'm just kind of at a loss here.

Knowing this girl, my grandma was in a nursing home and I saw how people treated her. Eventually the place got it's shit together and hired people who actually gave a damn. Stealing pills is one thing, but threatening to push someone out of a wheelchair? I get it, you hate your job, but you don't post stuff like that on Facebook.

Although we didn't need to take any official action

---

Hey folks. In any post on Reddit there's usually some great &amp; ""how did I not know that before"" information. I've always been a ""lurker"" but I've been trying to be a more active member of Reddit. So here goes!

I got into a sour deal via Craigslist. My girlfriend loves pro wrestling &amp; we're in Upstate New York, he just wasn't able to make it so he had to get rid of the tickets. He sent me photos of the tickets along with several forms of ID with his **home address** on all of them. He also emphasized that he's been burned on Craigslist before. So we were both very very cautious. What we ultimately agreed upon was me sending a money order for the first ticket, then he sends after he gets it. Then we would just do the same thing over. I sent the money order along with a prepaid envelope (both certified &amp; with tracking information), saw that it got there, &amp; last I heard from him he was heading to the post office to cash in the money order &amp; send the ticket. Throughout the entire transaction he kept giving me reassurances. I know that doesn't really *mean* anything, but I saw him as a real, down to Earth person &amp; not someone looking to rob anyone. He even went so far as to send me a photo of the confirmed shipping of the money as reassurance. I know it was dumb to get into this in the first place, emailed

So... that's the situation. But I have a TON of his personal information. His home address (as I mentioned), &amp; a piece of mail. All with his address on it. Then his email &amp; his phone number, obviously. Also, he's not exactly hidden from the internet. All I have to do is Google his name &amp; a ton of information comes up. Finally, all the negotiation &amp; agreed-upon arrangement is right there in all the email.

I don't think he was out to rob me in the first place. I believe he just might've gotten a better offer &amp; he went with that. He hasn't put the ad back up either. I checked constantly. He's sorta sticking his tail between his legs &amp; hopes I stop trying to contact him &amp; drop it altogether. He doesn't seem very... smart. He mentioned that he lives with his mother in an apartment. He's 26 (sorry if I'm offending anyone). He's not very computer savvy &amp; he doesn't even have a bank account. I'm thinking this is the first time he's attempting something like this. In our negotiation he suggested that I could always come find him &amp; ""kick his ass"". I do not want to do that
So... is there anything I can do???

**TL;DR**
I was robbed $300 for a ticket on Craigslist

Edit: UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your kind attention &amp; help. I've sent him an email laying out what I plan on doing

He constantly tells us he hates living at home, but our family has made it clear that even if that is the case it wouldn't change our love for him). He graduated from school, but hasn't found a job (it's been about 2 years). Whenever I visit and ask him how the job hunt is going, he just rattles off excuses like it's the economy or that he's trying. Sometimes my dad and other siblings will send him job listings or recruiters we've talked to **FOR HIM**, but when **WE** follow up with the recruiter they often say *""Oh he never contacted us.""* We basically have to **FORCE** him to apply and even when he does, it's like he half-asses it.  
  
I've had many heart-to-heart conversations with him because I wanted to make sure he's not suicidal or anything, he'll make plans and diets and what have you, but 2 weeks into it quits and it's back to the same old same old.  
  
My dad/other siblings are about to snap on him and be blunt, because you still have school, etc, but at 25? Seriously??? My mom is afraid of us being so blunt with him, but the alternative is what...doing the same thing over and over and hitting 30? I feel like he's just postponing his life and waiting for it ""to start"", but doesn't realize you can't keep waiting forever.  
   
So what would you? Should he be forced to leave and to pack up and move somewhere

Yesterday he told me the following story: after ego-googling himself, search in linked page for ""(born ca.1965)"", this is where it's mentionned. From what he explained, she left for San Francisco after they broke up, had their child; he was just left out of the picture.

1373189213.0,1hsnrn,Many years ago I was abused by a teacher and I still haven't recovered. I don't know what to do.,plsineedhelp,30,3,3,"This will probably be a long post

So the story starts in primary school. Life was good, as a normal kid would be. Once I hit year 5 in school (around age 9-11, I'm not really sure) I had a teacher who took a dislike to me. I've spent many, many hours wondering about this, and I never came to a conclusion why, but he decided that I was his target. I was a smart kid, I was at the top of my class every year all the way until this teachers class. It was by no means because I was a bad student

Getting to the point... like I said, humiliate me in front of my whole class. One of the things he would do is get a baby doll from his desk and throw it at me (literally, at me) then he would spend the next 5 minutes mimicing a crying baby and calling me a cry baby and saying things like that. Naturally, the whole classroom laughed, except me. This went on for the whole year. I told my mum one time and she obviously was pissed and spoke to the headteacher and she said she'd ""sort it"" but it never happened. It continued until the next school year when I got a different teacher.

Ever since that year though... it changed me. It fucked me over completely. My confidence was shattered

So, with my confidence shattered I was too scared to make friends. I basically just hung around with the rejects that didn't care if I stood with them at lunch (that sounds harsh, but, I don't know how else to describe it). I was a straight A student, so I was in the top classes for every subject, and my group of friends weren't. So, every single class I had, I couldn't make friends in them. I suffered through the first 3 years of high school alone, most of my coursework went unfinished.

Needless to say, I struggled to even have a conversation with my own mother.

It wasn't until a few years later when I finally decided to do something about it. I was diagnosed with social anxiety, I'm still too scared to leave the house alone. Not to mention, I'm now 20 years old and I have no qualifications, literally no future. It's been ~6 years, and I haven't done anything during that time. I feel like my memory has deteriorated and if I tried to go to college or something I would struggle compared to how I was in school. I really don't know what to do. I want to get my A levels, go to uni, get a degree and move on with my life. But I can't. I'm stuck in the house because I'm literally too scared to be outside.

I guess what I'm asking is

Recently, and weeks to get a technician in.  Obviously, we were incredibly grateful they did so, as we are not in the position to fix it ourselves.  My entire family is very, very poor.

**I would like to take this moment to say

This evening, so I was leaning up against the side of the bus next to his wheelchair and chatting.  I shifted my weight, and somehow got my foot on his footplate, and there was a loud and sudden crack.

When we got off the bus, we can both smell melted plastic.  The wheel is scraping against the cover hard enough to melt and curl up the rim of the plastic wheel-well.

Obviously he can't drive it in this state.  We're terrified he's going to damage it worse, or worse, break the driveshaft.  At this point, I am fairly sure (or at least, hopeful) that the damage isn't too serious, it's just the cover.  Maybe, please

Here's the crux of the problem.

I am visiting from out of state.  I go back in a week.  He's divorced from my mother, they won't either.

While I'm here, Medicare will cover this, he can't take care of himself without the ability to get around, and he lives along, so I need to figure this out before I'm no longer here to help. 

Pertinent information:  we live in Los Angeles.  The chair is a hoveround

For my third year of college I moved to a larger town to pursue a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.  I have always enjoyed messing with computers, and when taught the right way, I enjoy math.  I guess in theory all of these things should make me a good candidate for a computer science degree.  My grades would disagree.  One thing that I should take into consideration is that at my two-year university, I couldn't take any Computer Science courses.  I basically started out as a freshman in terms of my degree when I got to the new school.  I left my 2 year college with a 3.5.  I have a 1.8 GPA right now, and if I don't basically get a 3.0 or above this semester, my university is going to suspend me.

I hate my job.  I dislike my classes, and mostly myself.  I love my girlfriend and room mate and have awesome friends, but for some reason those things don't keep me happy enough.

I was a nuc electrician's mate on a SSN out of Guam. 
I was discharged for alcohol rehabilitative failure. My failure was non-substance related but because I broke facility rules because I was told once I came back they were going to put me back on a boat.

A little background on my submarine experience, meaning they would go to the Chaplain or the Doc and say they were going to kill themselves. Not all of them were true cases of people being depressed as a lot of people just wanted out because our CO was abusive as all hell, worked us past our breaking point on every occasion he could, being especially hard on the engineering dept. He did not hide this, even going so far as to confide in another officer, in front of everyone in the control room. ""Blue shirts (enlisted) are like tools. You use them til they break, and then get a new one.""

 Anyways, because in the Nuclear Navy, any attention is bad attention. I guess what I'm trying to say, is the environment was comparable to Battered Wife syndrome, not that I'm comparing this to spousal abuse, but it was the feeling of not having a way out, and even if you called the cops
 But anyways, not a pure honorable, I'm not covered under VA benefits for jobs because I was never diagnosed with any sort of disability, apparently depression and anxiety and flashbacks to the service on a daily basis don't count. I can't find a job that requires any specialized training, even as an electrician, because every opening I've found requires you to be licensed (the state union doesn't recognize shipboard electrical work as prior experience), or have a degree, finding a simple job hasn't happened yet either because everyone's full up until kids go back to college. I don't have connections for work, because I worked 120+ hours a week every week if not underway

When one of my friends onboard tried to hang himself for more of less the same reasons, he was showered with concern and given an honorable discharge w/ full benefits. I got tossed aside because I gave up, because after asking for help and waiting 8 months to start any sort of treatment because the CO refused to send out the paperwork before he transferred, when I fell apart and couldn't do it anymore, it was because I was a piece of shit, and worthless. I busted my ass and gave so much to a bunch of people who called themselves my family, and when I fell down

I don't know. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a failure. Everything I worked for, that every time it came up that we were undermanned, overworked, and couldn't hold out on what we had, we were told by Big Navy that it would get better eventually, we would get people we were supposed to have, but we never did. I was always told, we don't have the people available. That was okay until I stood up and said ""I can't support"" Then I got told that a failed my country and deserved nothing in return. I know that things will get better eventually. I'm sorry,False,

I have wonderful friends who appreciate me. I have a loving and supportive family. I'm doing fascinating research with a great professor.

I have no clue at all what I'm doing for my research project, but when I presented at a lab meeting, my PI still thought I was doing a decent job.    

Sometimes I feel like jumping in front of a car just because I don't feel like I'll die if I do so.

EDIT: Thank you all for the help and support. I've emailed a counselor and a few trusted mentors about this, schizoaffective disorder, etc.). They've all told me that these feelings are a sort of rite of passage when you begin doing research and moving out of a coursework-based curriculum, and that most grad students feel this at some time or another. Knowing this is helping me feel as though I belong where I am, and that these feelings are bringing me closer to the professors and researchers I respect and admire.

 We've been together for over a decade. But he changed in the past year. Actually

He still has its corpse in storage and it's been 3 years. Won't let it go and if I try to do something about it he gets very heated at me.

He's now become very obsessed with Hitler

He drinks too much

He has mixed medications with alcohol(he has ADD and a doctor gave him antidepressants), continued to choke me until i begged him to stop and say sorry. 

So far I've been unsuccessful to get away from him because he has some sort of anemia that cases him to bruise very easily. to the point that he was railing my body against walls and the doorway and such

when I start trying to leave

This last time I started seeing flashes during the strangling and knew i was close to passing out which I was paranoid of doing because if I passed out

He uses his forearm for cutting off my air and it leaves less of a mark. I've seen doctors and they can't visually see it on me so I just say I fell and hit the back of my head which is my excuse to get pain killers for my back and neck afterwards. The only thing physically noticeable is the muscle spasms around my spine near my neck. I had a physio note that the muscles around my c-vertabre around my neck have been stressed tight and damaged(that was on my first choking). 


This still doesn't seem like it would be convincing to a cop that any abuse has happened. So I don't think I can get help that way. And I think it's a very effective method to accidently go overboard and kill a person because of the lack of marking and the disregard of it medically prior to becoming fatal so I feel very alone and abandoned in my recieved abuse.




He is very offended that I no longer wish to have sex anymore. I've stopped altogether for two months now. Says that it's no longer a point to have a relatoinship yet still won't let me leave. I am somewhat hoping that the lack of sex will make the idea of me leaving him more appealling for him. But it's more that I find him to be the most icky person on the face of the planet and it is painful that I have to see him every day.


I just never want him to touch me again and his insensitivity to his behaviour towards the recent events and expects everything to go back to normal has me in a slump.


I'm currently looking online for roommates. But I know that it will be a long time before I can do anything as he's always home


So i have to do it when he's not around and also need to stash my belongings somewhere.

My parents never married. I grew up with my mother in my grandparents house. We weren't poor, as did his drinking. For that I tip my hat to her. Somewhere around age 8 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was only in her mid 30s. She did her best to keep it from me but her hair was short and she traded the mini van for a little convertible. I was scared and so was she. She started acting like a friend, young and spontaneous. I could tell she thought she might not make it. Somehow in her mind, instead of just leaving me in the hands of our family, it made sense to find a man. A completely new stranger to date and hopefully marry before it was too late. That way I would at least be left with a father.

Each suitor scared me more than the last. The winner being the worst of all. My mother had surgery and radiation therapy. She bounced back fine. All just in time to find him. A disease in his own right.

It seemed each year after they met was a new mile stone. They were engaged

She gave birth to his daughter

After my first year of high school I had a few close friends. Some of which I trusted enough to confide in. It wasn't long after that when word traveled to the right ears. My friend had a cousin that we used to hang with quite a bite

He's gone, usually with the same friends and family that informed the cops of my predicament. That seemed to draw a line in the sand if you will. I was trying to go out like a normal teen and yet I remember getting dragged back and yelled at and being told I was selfish. Needless to say, I don't feel close to my family, not emotionally anyway. But unfortunately I feel that they are physically breathing down my neck. I understand that this will pass, but only in time and distance. people like my step father are wired to uproot families in this manner. at times it seems irreversible... but we will see.

Now don't get me wrong

One day were at a red light. A young girl, ""see, why couldn't you look like that?"" I didn't quite know what she meant. ""...then none of this would have happened."" just so were all one the same page, im a six foot blonde, blue eyes, weighing in at 150. I can only assume by those words that she felt my outer attributes were to blame for the incident. I can only hope it was all the stress and chemo talking and not my true mother.

my first high school was private catholic. they told my mom things like ""they tend to hate god when things like this happen"" all i wanted was to be left alone and just be done with school at whatever pace i could handle but i was under their microscope. everybody knew. we decided i needed to transfer out and finish my last two years elsewhere. at that point i pretty much lost contact with the family i had trusted in. and for that matter I lost contact with just about everything. I wasn't drinking, anything like that. I just sort of shut down. In a sick way, i wish i could remember more.

About the same time I finish high school (a few d-bag boyfriends later) my step father finally gets his sentence. It wasn't without me having to talk about my vagina and his cock about 1000 times over in a court room full of strangers. his now dead father would stare bullets into my head as i tried to vocally recall the event between me and his 40 yr old son. He even had the nerve to try and appeal and so I got to relive the whole thing. All said and done

I received counseling until I was about 18 through agencies made for abused children but i didn't pursue any additional help. I'm beginning to feel a was a fool for not finding a new shrink ASAP.

okay

i still haven't given into any suppressed demons unless you count art, we've been together for about three years. I still talk to his family. they treat me like one of their own and I can only hope they know I'm very grateful for that. thing is, he and I are renting my mom's basement (in the house where the abuse took place) for $400 a month... Let me repeat that...

I RENT the basement in which I was REPEATEDLY RAPED. Oh and would anybody like to guess how much money I make a month?... Here's a hint... If I'm lucky
so why do i make so little we ask?

You see

So how do I pay for school? I call up my dead beat dad once a year and he helps me fill out my financial aid form. i didn't think i was able to cry anymore until that day

So that should sum it up. This is where I'm at now. My question is

The options I've been pondering are...
Transfer to fancy expensive college and rent nearby apartment
Transfer to also fancy yet less expensive college where all my credits transfer and the tuition is much cheaper
Or just finish my associates and start job hunting so we can move out. (The bf is kind of against it because he doesn't want me to sell myself short)

anybody out there think there is some sort of Oprah quality story scholarship? i mean im getting sick of hitting walls with all this built up in me. why did i make it through this far if it was just to finish about 60 credit hours at a community college then just give up on all my dreams and settle for some job i may hate?

What a long hard road it has been. First, she would never see our children again. Due to her making claim there was domestic violence (which there has been none) and the claims of abuse from my teenage daughter, the local Child Protective Services placed our children in a state of deprevation. 

My wife was forced to stay at this woman's shelter without the ability to leave or contact me or any of my family. She was forced into daily labor and religious classes. She was trapped by this place for nearly 5 months

She has now dropped the restraining order and moved back home. Our children have been interviewed by numerous child psychologists and have been found to be healthy and with zero signs of abuse. Unfortunately the CPS office is still claiming a state of deprevation for our children and will not allow us to bring them back home. Only my wife is allowed to visit them once a week

My teenage daughter ran from custody and has been living with her boyfriend during this entire period, whilst our little ones are in a foster home they refer to as jail. They are also being indoctrinated into christian religion, which we do not practice. The local government continues to frame us as bad parents, although we have neither been indicted or convicted of any crime. 
We are at our wit's end

We need help!!! We have attempted to contact state offices regarding the local CPS's office abuse of power and disregard for our basic constitutional rights, and besides, this area seems to be a 'good ole boy's network', so a local attorney may not be the best choice. We do not know where to turn to, or what to do. We are turning to Reddit in hopes of being guided in the right direction, we want our children home, and they are miserable without us.

Since we used our Wi-Fi in the same manner as we have for 1 1/2 years at home (movies, email etc.) we never thought to monitor our usage and now we've been billed $700 in usage charges for 1 1/2 months of service on the Wi-Fi device. 

Someone out there please let me know what can be done. If there is another subreddit that is best for this type of problem please let me know but I cannot afford to pay this bill Sprint is trying to stick me with.

1278701825.0,cnt85,I've been accused of molesting a 4-year-old girl.,por_que,27,4,37,"I'm with this woman that has three kids. Let's just call her Ashley. We have been together for 9 months. I'm 24. She's 23. Wonderful woman. Wonderful kids. I love them all. Ages 4(girl), but this still eats away at me. He post things on his facebook and myspace about how big of a bitch she is and how he hates her. He found out where our old apartment was and would come over everyday. We moved. Calling the cops wouldn't do anything. They would always say they needed to talk it out since they both have custody. Ashley and I both work. All the kids are in daycare. She just started working about two week ago. I'm the one who's paying for everything. I treat these kids as they are my own. I love them all and would rather die before seeing them get hurt. I would do anything for them. As I would do anything for her also.

**Dad's Background:** He's 24. Unemployed and living with his mother in a bad part of town. He was abusive to her when they were together. He was also very controlling. He wanted nothing to do with her or the kids in till I came into the picture. He has a felony and is currently on probation. I know he has warrants right now. He hasn't been going to his probation officer (or whatever they are called) because of the warrants. 

**What happen:** Around 6pm he called saying how he wants to see all the kids and have them over at his mother's house for a while. We agree and take them over there. We drop them off at his mom's house. This was around 7pm. No problem. Ten minutes later of course we get a text about how she is a bad mother and she dropped the youngest one off with a dirty diaper and just talking shit. Like always....nothing new. We just went home to relax. He of course was calling her phone nonstop the whole time. When we finally went to go pick them up around 10pm. He said that his mom wanted to talk to her about one of their kids on the porch. I'm of course not allowed in or around his mom's house. So she went up there to talk to them. She was never out of my sight. Only on the porch. The kids were inside. After five minutes everyone is getting into it. He's yelling. While I'm waiting his girl friend pulls up and walks on the porch also. So at some point his sister (she's 19) comes out crying claiming that the oldest one was saying that I was touching her in her private areas and that I hit on her. I have never even laid a hand on the child and of course never touched her like that in any way.

I didn't know what was going on in the time. I was just in the car looking at them making sure he doesn't trying anything stupid. So she walking back to the car with only the youngest ones crying. I'm thinking he's trying to keep the oldest one and she is upset of that. Before she even opens the car door his girl friend is coming over to the car. All I can hear is ""...but what is it is true?"". I have no idea what this means at the time. My girl friend is telling her I'm not like that and I wouldn't anything to hurt them. I caught on to what was going on now. While I'm in shock and coming to terms of what's happening I notice the dad, but sure in the hell wasn't going to stay around to get jumped or possible killed over something I did not do.

I drove a few blocks away while she called the cops. Well apparently his sister already did and the cops were on their way. The cops told us to meet them back at his mom's house. A cop was already there when we arrived. I'm already emptying my pockets knowing I'm either going to be arrested or at least thrown in the back of a cop car. I was right. They put me in hand cuffs and put me in the back of the cop car. They already assumed I'm a pedophile so the cops are already treating me like shit. I can't blame them. While I'm sitting back there sweating my ass off they of course have the dome light on where everyone can see me. His whole family is there at this time just staring at me assuming I'm just a scum bag pedophile. I'm feeling completely worthless even though I'm not guilty. Odd how that works. So around 12:30 the cops tell me if someone can pick me up because I couldn't drive with my girl friend because they are going to the hospital to have a rape kit done to both of the girls. I have no idea how that process works

My girl friend called me from the hospital telling me the only reason they are saying this is to make our life miserable. As much as I agree with that statement I don't think they made this story up. He is a complete asshole

Sorry for the wording/typos. I didn't sleep last night and I'm not even thinking correctly anymore. Plus I was never the best writer.

Any advice on what should do? Should I still have sympathy for him? I feel so horrible even though I have not done anything wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. Thank for any input and for even reading this.

I just recently landed a job working for a big sales/trading company. It's been an experience of many firsts for me: First time I'd ever worked in a huge luxurious office building. First time I'd ever had my own desk, etc. First time I've had my job pay to have me travel out to and work at satellite offices while setting me up in a nice hotel, expensing my meals, etc. I've got fantastic benefits, room to move up in the company. I sit next to a guy who's worked in the industry for 30+ years who makes more than six-figures as a trader with single transactions as high as $80,000 a pop. 

I've been here for 5 months, I hate picking up the phone and making cold calls (and I'm especially awful at it), I can't get myself to get involved with and beleive in our products, and be enthusiastic about them like my co-workers. I just can't seem to be able to pick any of it up, and i'm constantly having to ask the same questions over again. Every second of every day I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I come in and stare at my computer trying to make it look like I'm busy, and I value being a hard worker very much. Every time I interact with my co-workers they are always expounding on how lucky we are to be working for such the company, and how great it is.

The guy who has trained me has been phenomenally patient and helpful, and have been so accommodating and nice. I am so disappointed in myself that I'm letting them down, and I have so much anxiety about it. 

I've only ever gotten jobs via networking with people, and my lack of any quantifiable, marketable skills.

I am totally paralyzed with indecision

My problem is this: over the past 6 months, he insisted that campus was in the complete opposite direction and proceeded to run away. I had to have a friend drive me around looking for him; luckily, we picked him up a few blocks away from school. It then took me and 4 of my girlfriends to calm him down enough so that he would not run away and get lost again.

The next time, it took 2 men (including his sister’s fiancé) and 3 women (his sister, cousin, and me) to wrestle him into submission.

Tonight, the police picked him up and all they gave him was a lecture.

What do I do about all this? I swore after the “farm incident” that I would end our relationship if I had to go through that again. There is absolutely no communicating with my boyfriend when he gets this drunk; he has hurt many people and lost a few friends by acting this way. Additionally, or leave him.

But there's an issue. My brother was doing a project, and discovered an email account.

The email account's name has sexual connotations first off

My father replied with good grammar and spelling

We are stumped on what we should do

I'm pretty sure its my father, and claims to be about an inch taller. All this seems to come together when I paired it with the constant flight delays from the place in Tennessee he just started going to. I want to speculate that his account was hacked, but he uses our ""family"" password, which is a password for general things, like wifi or the computers. He has a wide range of tastes, 30-50 about.

I've no idea how to do that. I want to solve this before my other brothers try to because their methods will actually make a stupid sexual desire impact our lives! If anybody can help

The first time I talked to him he told me that people are living in his attic and dropping acid on him at night. He is clearly confused. I think he might get home visits from a nurse

My issue is this: He has some kind of home alarm. It goes off multiple times per day, 3am, 4:30am, and then again 5:40. Last night we were lucky as it only went off at 3:05am and then again at 4:10am. It is the loudest noise I have ever heard in my life and my bedroom window is the closest to his house. The cops NEVER come when the alarm goes off. I have no idea if it is linked to a central service.

The cops say they can't help bc he is probably setting it off accidentally. 

This is affecting me on a completely weird level and I'm not sure how to fix it. My wife's fix is ""Wait for him to die"" and I am thinking it will take the same.

* I now live with my serious boyfriend of almost 2 years, in turn, affects me.  I come home around 10pm, exhausted, with about 3 hours of ""me time"" (the only time I get to study, which clearly doesn't happen) before going to bed.

My little sister, on the other hand, is awesome; she is 18 and a Freshman at my university.

I'm 23, and I've completed nothing worthwhile in my life; I'm consumed with shame and self-hatred.

From the earliest time that I remember trying to interact with other human beings

I told myself that all these other kids obviously had something I didn't - the ability to socialize naturally.  I felt that I needed to learn how to do this at all costs.  I set about doing it very scientifically.  It was frustrating and hopeless.  I never once ate lunch with the other kids in elementary school, because I had never observed two people alone before.  I felt like the protocol MUST be different.  I remember hating being alone with my own parents.   I pretended to have friends in front of my parents.  I'd make up stories to tell them about the things I did with my non-existent friends to make it more believable.  I KNEW that I couldn't tell them about what I was going through.  

I never told anyone that I struggled like this, they would never be able to accept me as one of them.  I would ruin the magic.  I would only be able to magically socialize with others if I was able to figure out how to socialize among them alone, on my own, just like they did.  

I'm now 23.  In my first 2 years of college I was able to socialize quite well.  I blame this partly on a delusion I had set up for myself that gave me extreme confidence.  Eventually, and I eventually devolved into a full psychotic break - that lasted 8 months untreated (my family is religious and doesn't believe in psychology).  I completely withdrew from all human beings save my mom, dad, and sister.  I hallucinated rampantly, thought ever more frequently (and elaborately) in delusions, and generally felt pretty trapped.  

I'm finally being treated by a psychiatrist.  I couldn't do it on my own, but she won't see care because God forbids it, she believes).  Her belief didn't stop her from attempting suicide twice, believing my brother was attempting to kill her, and spreading scribbled notes about how God had forsaken her all around the house.  

I'm finally ready to admit what I'm going through to others, but unfortunately I only passed one of three of those semesters, for it was during my time here at Berkeley that my psychotic break occurred.  

I'm taking time off now, but who I suddenly was not able to feel connected with today, with whom suddenly today in particular I was not able to socialize.  I'm scared, and unsure of why I am having this sudden flash back to a much, much worse time in my life.  But I have hope for the future.  And I wanted to share this with you, because it is a memory of something that really helped me consider, for the first time, that maybe I had been thinking about things all wrong all my life as far as socialization goes

Reddit is full of so many wonderful people

Now, I joined a local youth orchestra to play trumpet. I hadn't ever taken lessons and I was pretty horrible. During one rehearsal, the president of the youth symphony approached me and asked if I would like to learn the french horn - and if so, he would give me a free lesson. I obliged, as I was interested in the instrument, and went to my first free lesson. After my first lesson, he asked if I was interested in continuing to play the horn. I replied that I was, once a week. 
He was a very generous man who always took his free time to help me with not only my horn, life inquiries… whatever I needed help with. Throughout my sophomore and junior year of high school he was like a father to me, and taught me everything I know on the horn.
I decided I was going to major in music as a junior. Because of this
He started writing me poetry, I accredited it to the fact that he was like a father to me. But then it just hit me how un-father-like the situation was.
While I was at a music camp, pissed, my mother confronted him about it. He simply told her that he was in love with me, and that he couldn't help if he wanted some alone time with me. By the way, this is a 50+ year old man, and I was just a 17 year old girl at the time. My mother, flabbergasted
When I started to complain to my mother about the situation - how uncomfortable it made me feel - she awkwardly avoided the topic by making fun of it (""Ohhh, and always turns to perverted jokes to lessen the awkward tension. She's a character.
Just a few bad encounters/occurrences: once, he spent an entire lesson telling me how much he loved me with poetry and how he constantly ""felt my presence"". It was extremely awkward and made me feel very scared. Every lesson he asks for hugs. Scary, long, back groping hugs that last for literally minutes (which seem like  lifetimes). They actually makes me die on the inside every time. I finally started to make excuses to refuse, but it's hard when I used to see him as a father figure. These are just a few TINY incidents/occurrences of THOUSANDS that I can immediately think of. Some are worse.
When I went to a music festival this summer (six weeks long), and actually drove to visit me (a 15+ hour drive).
Now, and is using this against me to guilt me into keeping in close contact. The first few weeks of school, he called 8 times daily, texted CONSTANTLY throughout the day, and has sent me mail/packages/gifts consistently.
I am so confused, but it's too hard for me to tell him straight up as he used to mean something to me. He was like a father to me, and suddenly crossed borders that shouldn't have been crossed. Now he is an obsessive stalker, but because I was once close to him it's very hard for me to cut him off and be mean to drive the point home that I do not want this attention.
My mother tries to help, so his advice is rather… violent (bahaha, just kidding). Reddit, can you give me any advice? ANY advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am 19 year old Asian American male going to college on the west coast.  Born in America

Is it just me or do Asian American males have it really rough here in the United States?


People always assume random things about me.  One time, and was like ""that's expected, you're Asian, you probably didn't even need to work hard"", which made me kinda pissed off since I had actually put a lot of work into it.


I was hanging out with another Asian American female friend and she told me that she thought Asian guys were ""wimpy and probably all losers/nerds.""  This really surprised me



In society it seems that Asian American males are eternally treated as the ""Beta male"" no matter what they are really like.  This seems true in movies as well.  The Asian male characters all have really negative stereotypical portrayals.  I went to see the Hangover Part II with some friends from school (I hadn't seen Hangover Part I).  They all thought it was hilarious.  I thought it was horrible and wanted to punch something every time Ken Jeong's character was on screen.


I thought the United States was supposed to be the epitome of freedom and equality for people of any race or color.  The other day


Does anyone have any tips for dealing with these type of issues?  Am I just imagining things or does life really suck for Asian males in the US?",,t5_2r367,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1gi8jv/is_it_just_me_or_do_asian_american_males_have_it/

I am an introvert. I take time to get to know people and due to some crap that happened in the past, and then when I accepted, the offeror would get mad that I ""invited"" myself along, so I am pretty sure something is wrong with me and I don't ""get"" group dynamic stuff. So, when I want to do something that has a group invite, I always always double check to ensure that I'm invited and I never ever assume i'm included, even if a group invite is presented to a group that I'm a part of. (Ie- someone comes into the kitchen and says ""Anyone want to go see a movie?"" If I want to go, despite my introverted tendancies

Despite being a weirdo introvert

I had a friend that I knew through other friends. We'd go to the same shows

She is substantially younger than me (early 20's to my late 20's)and very, she's been really dismissive of me. It's been a year now, and it's like she's actively trying to keep me out of social groups. Mutual friends will come over, and they will go to her room to watch TV shows or hang out. If I knock and ask if I can come in, she says things like... ""well, there isn't really room for one more person..."" or something like that, but then other mutual friends try to invite me in and then I feel weird and she acts more and more dismissive of me the more she sees other people pursuing friendships with me who are also her friends. 

I have tried to be extra nice to her, etc. 

She is very, and I don't want to be included all the time, just once in a while. But when other friends invite me to go places with them, she will do things like ensure they leave without me or that there is no room for me to come along. If i try to talk to her (nothing super serious, just like ""hi"" or ""excuse me"" or normal roommate stuff like ""have you seen the cat today?""), she'll ignore what I say and turn her back to me. 

She's gotten so good at discreetly making sure that i get left out that other mutual friends think I don't want to be THEIR friends anymore either

And also, recently, i've accepted invitations to hang out with people she's on the outs with for whatever reason, and she's now telling people that i'm ""taking their side"". I'm not taking any sides. I just don't have drama with anyone (except her, I guess?) 

I don't want people I like and want to be better friends with to think that i'm always ditching them/uninterested in hanging out just because ONE PERSON is making sure I have no access to the group or group activities, she's just really passive aggressive. 

(last time we had a house party, i took ONE of my close friends that she didn't know (but other people in the house did) into her room to try the beer because he also homebrews and was really excited about it, and getting to talk to the brewer that made it. She flipped out, told me I was ""disrespecting her space"" by bringing in ""strangers"" and that she felt like i was totally disrespectful, even though the room had about 20 people in it at the time, some of which were people her friends had brought in that she didn't know.) 

I""m at my wit's end and freaking out over it. I do not know how to solve this because she's arranged it so that if i bring anything up

I'm not even sure I'm posting this in the right reddit

This is also my last resort. I've been fighting for five years with this hell I'm in and I'm finally at a point where I might stop fighting all together. A part of me doesn't want that to happen and it's the part of me writing this right now. The rest of me is waiting to throw in the towel. I don't mean suicide

Firstly, they had six kids, myself being the youngest and to make matters sound even more perfect, my father treats me like a princess, my mother is seriously the coolest mom ever and my five siblings? They sometimes fight over who gets to hang out with me (not exaggerating, they've actually argued right in front of me)

Yeah...

What the hell am I on here for...

I usually start my story in Junior year of high school, sometimes we were hard pressed to come up with things to entertain us, so I started writing fiction for them to read. I had no idea it would explode into a ten year obsession that I would continue to write even to this day. I created and molded this fantasy world, characters that I would find weeks, months, years worth of entertainment from just by developing their personalities, their histories, lost all my friends, I was never the same). I was always terrible at school even in elementary, which is why I think I started writing in the first place. No one could yell at me for writing fiction

And even in Junior year, I could still find solace in my stories. Even if I felt hopeless or unbearably sad, it was always a comfort to know that no matter how hard life got, I would always have those stories to light that spark of happiness in my heart. They had never failed me before and I was sure they never would. And even when I had to put them on the shelf for a few years while I dealt with college (the only horror story of my life really), I could always pick them up again and laugh and smile at the documents littered all over my hard drive.

As for college, I went into one of the worst panic attacks of my life (like, thinking your life is OVER) and then another one of the same magnitude the day of move-in. To boot, for the next two semesters, I was nauseous 24/7, went to the nurse at least twice a week worried I was suffering from some horrible illness and three times ended up in the ER because I thought I was dying. Every ache and pain then became a death sentence and I was miserable the ENTIRE time I spent away at college. I dropped out after only one year (wasted thousands of dollars just to be sick and miserable for ten months) and came home to attend the community college with my brother, which was much more bearable and pleasant. That year I finally felt like I was recovering from my depression and anxiety and then last summer landed a job that I ended up loving and making a few friends at. Life finally started to be getting better. I was writing again too

Well somehow it did... and not only did it start to suck again
And it started with a root canal retreatment.

Everyone has been trying to convince me that my mental torment and that procedure are in no way related, I was assaulted with this overwhelming dizziness that continued for two weeks until I had enough and went to the ER again where they said I had BPV (Benign Positional Vertigo). They gave me medication that didn't work and instead I went to an ENT who also assured me that a root canal couldn't make me constantly dizzy. This was back in March and since then my depression returned, my hypochondria started going haywire, I STILL have on-going depersonalization where before it was just episodic and the dizziness has never gone away. The depression however, has warped and taken on a form I've never felt before.

At first, I was feeling emotionally blunted, like I just couldn't get that spark of emotion anymore. I could cry or laugh sincerely, but it's like I didn't feel it in my heart... I was sure it would pass, but then in September I went through a month long existential crisis, where I thought I was losing my mind, I thought I was going to end up in an insane asylum because I just didn't feel like me with the emotional numbness and I fought so hard to try to feel anything, making it deteriorate because there's no other way I would go back to my stories and feel NOTHING. No happiness. No spark. Not even any interest.
I have ALWAYS used them to comfort myself and when it doesn't work for the first time in ten years, to feel empty and hollow, so it has to be something physical or physiological, right?

In October it only got worse... I started to come to terms with the fact that my emotions were gone and I was never getting them back because I'm sure my brain is sick somehow. There's no other way I would toss aside my stories like this. And because my family and doctors know I'm a hypochondriac, I don't know her and I feel like I'm living through this shell I have no connection with. She has an empty laugh and a fake smile and even though this should all make me sad and even more depressed, I don't because there are no emotions left in me to do so.

The cops showed up, and just a few hours later she was Baker Acted at the hospital (she went voluntarily, but apparently that means absolutely nothing). If it had just been that, she might have been released, but she had told me many times before, when angry, so I said the same to the nurses. I really think she only ever said it to get to me

I'm now learning about the Baker Act (Florida only), drugged, tested, etc... for up to 72 hours). My wife now has no privacy, and is subject to humiliating tests and cold showers.

My wife tells me she is starving, but the food is so horrible and flavorless that she just can't bring herself to eat it.

I'm sure that in this age of employers looking up potential employees and our information being so freely accessible then someone in 'the system' will have thought to do it, is how none of his 34 'Facebook friends' have commented or thought these postings might be a sign of a dangerous mind. Again though - perhaps I'm reading too much into them, or perhaps no-one thought it was their business. Heck, I could even have the wrong person - I'm only going on name, age, and locality.

I want to post a link to the news article and Facebook comments here, but the comments about us being controlled do strike me as indicative of a disorder perhaps.

I'm not sure what I'm seeking through posting this, thanks!) or perhaps just to get it out there and see other people's thoughts on whether the Facebook comments are relevant. I really don't know, but it's weighing on my mind.

I'm extremely guarded, especially when it comes to discussing, sharing, or otherwise indicating my feelings, so I just kind of blamed the lack of communication on being overwhelmed with work.

I wasn't expecting to ever be able to open up to anyone, because I respect him and value our friendship so much that I'd rather keep everything else to myself and deal with it alone than risk bothering or upsetting him, and messing up things between us at all.

1359828844.0,17rgc9,"Last night my mom and I had a huge fight, and she threatened to kill herself. I called the police, she spent the night in the hospital, and now she basically hates me. How should I proceed?",throwawaymom1451,8, so if you want to skip it I’d appreciate any advice about dealing with irrational people

I’m 23 and female, explosive situations, and they happen every time I come home. We can be getting along great and then suddenly we’re both screaming. It’s not normal and I want to be able to communicate with her, but through all my efforts and approaches I have not yet found this to be possible.

Conversing with my mother is like walking in a minefield. I find that she is very easily offended, or misunderstands what I said, then she claims I hate her and that I have *always* treated her ""like shit"". When she says these things it is absolutely devastating to me. It not only makes me upset, hurt, and frustrated, but it is incredibly counter-productive in our communications with each other, and she has no clue of the damaging mind-fuckery she causes me.

I couldn’t even tell you how our fight started last night. I came home from college for a doctor’s appointment, you’ve *always* treated me like shit”. Then I explain to her how her words make me feel and all she can do is try and convince me that she is hurting more, that I am the bad guy here. She is my mom so of course she is *fantastic* at pushing all the right buttons, and it’s as if she is making a conscious effort to simply cause me pain.

She is an instigator. I am not claiming to be a perfect person, and perceptive, asking her questions to better understand how she feels. But I feel there is absolutely no getting through to her. And I must admit, my patience runs out; I can’t deal with hearing all the hurtful things she says to me after a while, and it is frustrating that we are getting absolutely nowhere despite my best efforts. She is extremely dramatic, acting like an actress and coming up with really dramatic lines that honestly just sound ridiculous and silly to me. I can’t take her seriously and I can’t get through to her.  So after a while of trying my best, I end up screaming too. Not hurtful things like she’s saying to me, to which she assures me that she is hurting more

The repetition and circles make me want to hit my head against the wall out of frustration because I *really* am trying. It’s a terrible

So last night when the fight escalated to the point of both of us screaming and crying

I am full-out panic mode now. I start going “Are you serious, we need help, this isn’t normal, I can’t do this,” etc. She is crying in such a way that suggests she may need medical attention. So I say that we need to calm down and that I’m going to go sit in my car for a while. I sit there, call my boyfriend, calm down a bit

More of the same, call the police and explain the situation. I tell the operator I will be waiting down the block from my house and that I want to talk to the police first. They come, I flag them down, I explain that I’m not trying to get her in trouble and that she is probably going to be upset that I called them. They assure me she won’t get in any sort of trouble. So they go in my house and talk to her. After a while I go in. They say they need to take her to the hospital to talk to a psychiatrist, and that they are obligated to do so when someone self-threatens. My mom isn’t kicking and screaming, but is clearly very unhappy. They take her away in an ambulance.

I call the hospital after a little while to talk to her. She is *beyond* angry, and that she isn’t sure if they will *ever* release her (“I didn’t expect them to keep me overnight, so who knows!”) And the actress-dramatic line that she came up with: “Throwawaymom1451, I will forgive you for this.. *someday…………., but not today*.”  She repeated this several times throughout the conversation, sounding like she was trying her damnedest to win an Oscar. It creeps me out that she’s not self-aware enough to see how absurd she sounds when she pulls the weird actress thing.

The whole phone conversation I just keep repeating that I love her, I let her know I was confident that I *absolutely* did the right thing by calling the police and that I’m not at all sorry for doing so. I told her to keep me informed and that I will come pick her up at a moment’s notice; she told me she’d rather walk home.

Here’s the real kicker. She said something along the lines of

She stayed overnight, and she’s giving me the silent treatment. And that brings us to the present moment.

How should I proceed

TL;DR- My mom and I have explosive fights. Pattern: I try and communicate, and the fight escalates. Last night she threatened to kill herself so I called the police. She basically hates me now.

My little brother (20yro) lives with my parents after bouncing around the state/country trying to find his happiness (which ended in failure).

He has a history of suicide attempts

He currently and always has refused psychiatric help/counselling/therapy. He says he is not sick. My parents are wonderful people and great parents. When we offer him help or even an ear to listen to what he has to say

He seems paranoid and makes outrageous statements about his extreme hatred for our country (US). Any attempt for discussion or offering our love ends in him screaming retorts and arguments to things we didn't even say... Its almost as if he's making things up in his head

He obsessively rides his bike for hours an hours. He has one friend that nobody has ever seen
He states he is neither interested in men or women. He can barely hold a job or go to school and has never completed anything he's started.

He goes everywhere my parents go, just sits there and watches them. One night my parents felt like they needed to lock the door while they slept because he was behaving so strange, they thought he was going to snap. He is running their lives, the mood of the house, they are walking on eggshells... It isn't fair to them.

In Sweden, we have very many, which I am missing.  If you would like to occasion them with me, I would.  We can get along in other ways as well.  I’ve been following you so closely that I’m sometimes feel afraid that you feel my hot breath on the back of your neck.  I’ve whiffed your aroma and imagine experiencing the intermingling of our body odors.  I have been tempting to investigate.  I have been drawn to you frequently in my fantasy life.  You are inside my mind for some time, but you would be welcome inside other places.  The idea causes much heat for me.  Would you like to see all this?  I would feel my mouth begin to water as your lips move closer to mine.  I would much enjoy the startled look in your eyes as you investigate inside my overwhelming pants.  I am inexperienced and impressionable.  I would want to gain your knowledge inside me.  For you to be gentle

My parents died when I was a teen, I married out of survival. He was abusive, I divorced him 5 years later.  a single mother of 21 would spend the next 15 years of my life living for my children.  Working, sacrificing to make sure they had a roof over their head, food on the table and clothes for school.  If they needed and I didn't have it...I went without...in order for them to have.  Times were tough, but I made it through.
 
Then I married again; my firsts daughters father.  Great man...5 years of marriage, I divorced him.  But by this stage in my life, I had 4 grandchildren.
 
So, fall in love, marry, get my citizenship, thousands of miles away from my children and grandchildren.  And am learning my husband is verbally abusive, disrespectful, very selfish and has a problem with crack.  I had a job, I gave my resignation
 
So I sit here today, if I tell him this he will ensure the money is tucked away.

I know I have to get a place

I don't feel motivated or determined. I guess when I had the girls, my will is diminished.  

Staying with my girls is not possible.  I do have a girlfriend who lives 250 miles from my girls but I want to be in the same area as my grandchildren.

My need for advice comes from the job I am leaving rather than the one I am going to. Since giving my notice last week (well ahead of the expected in my industry) it has become quite clear they weren't terribly happy with my performance. At no point did they ever bring anything up with me. Throughout my brief employment here I have never received any feedback, or read blogs. They have never brought this up as a problem. I always get my work done in a timely fashion and thought that must have been all they were looking for. I never really was given the opportunity to prove myself or show what I have and bring to the table. The job they advertised turned out to not be what they actually wanted filled (hence my jumping ship), and as such I still have no idea what they are looking for out of my position.

Today while I had headphones on (normal)

I am insanely full of emotions of all sorts. I want to have a private conversation with them. I want to throw a camera at the wall. I want to write a damning email that no one will read. I want to not show up tomorrow or storm out right now. I want to get into an argument via email with one or both of them. I want to stand up and start yelling at them. I want to do nothing at all. I...I don't know what to do. I just don't know.

I have two more weeks here. I don't do much so it isn't very taxing

To clarify, etc. Accordingly I am my job, and always throw myself into work. I identify as my job and whatever I am doing at the time. I don't have much outside of work. When you regularly work 12-18 hours a day 5-7 days a week you don't get much of a chance at other things in life. When not working I have a very limited number of mostly solo activities I do. When out of work I tend to get pretty depressed. By commenting on my job they are commenting on me. By telling me I am not good at my job they are telling me I am not good.

My job is me. I work. That is what I do. And I am damn good at it

This is bothering me so insanely much I cannot explain it. This isn't something I am used to or really experienced before. I know it fairly irrelevant because I am leaving this job in two weeks anyway

I guess I want to know what I should do. Should I have any response

I love video games, died in a motorcycle accident leaving my house a year ago. My best friend from highschool shut me out and didn't help me when I needed him most, so I stopped talking to him. I only have a few people I still speak with, and they're online friends. They still mean a lot to me but there's a huge divide between friends you can invite over and online friends. In games, the rewards feel meaningless now because I'm just doing them for myself and I don't care about myself. The whole point of getting achievements was to share them. I can't enjoy the story because I don't have enough free time. I always have reddit to share, but unless it's truly incredible it's not worth posting about. I keep buying games, but I don't want to play them. Maybe it's just this time of year, but these are all just reminders of how sad I have become.

The only thing I have left is my job and my amazing dog Alex. http://i.imgur.com/VAnXZ.jpg (He sat there for a full 2 minutes so that I could take the picture. He's so disciplined

I work for my parents and they push me harder than my body can handle. I constantly have to prove myself to them because they paid for my lawsuit so they see me as a financial burden, get them a ton of business by being nice and helpful to customers. I constantly get complements on my work from other people. My back is so bad now that it never stops hurting. I'm hoping that I can rest it during the winter but the worst part is that they didn't believe me. I went to my doctor, got an x-ray, got a moving x-ray, and then I got surgery to kill the nerve endings in my back called Radiofrequency Rhizotomy. The preliminary surgery to even see if it would work backfired. The doctor couldn't get through my neck so he pushed harder and I came out of the surgery crying with twice as much pain as before. I started to have symptoms of a slipped disk. It felt like warm water was rushing over my legs, I couldn't move my arms sometimes. I was terrified. My parents made me go back to the doctor and get a list of limitations. He said I had no limitations, because all they saw was mild bone degeneration.

After that I worked as hard as I had to because my doctor said I had no limitations. The pain is severe now and I'm on a constant supply of tramadol. I take 3 types of sleep medications to go to bed every night and my parents, they're much more reasonable, but when they're working, they hurt so bad they turn into monsters and take their pain out on me. It's not healthy, but we're all stuck where we are. When they're around I feel like I get through the day by being angry, because it helps keep my focus away from the pain and how depressing my life has become.

My mood changes from day to day but there's always this dark cloud looming over me. When I was born there were complications and the doctors had to take away my... ability to reproduce. Everything else works, is so special to me, it's the closest I can feel to having the perfect child and then him being diagnosed with cancer. I don't want to outlive him, and while I'm stable now, I don't know what I'll do when he starts to get sick.

I tried secret santa this year, but it just made me feel worse. I haven't gotten my gift yet, but I don't know how I'll feel when I get it. I was on antidepressants, but my parents made me stop using them even though they were helping me. They thought I was yelling at them because of the medications, and now I don't know what to do. The medication that I was taking was in direct conflict with my pain meds so I can't go back on them even if I wanted to now or I could risk having a seizure. I'm on the max dosage of tramadol and I still barely make it through the day.

Quite frankly, I'm out of ideas, because it's reached the point where she's wallowing in self-pity but isn't changing her lifestyle or showing any *real* remorse for the effect she's having on her closest friends.

Obviously, but I'm worried that that'll only drive her deeper into depression.

1328025303.0,p4ncp,Neighbor hit my car; denies everything and fixes her car; can she get out of this?,whatathrowaway345,23,3,29,"Hey folks

Obvious throwaway here. Here's what happened:

Last week, she hit my car.

I throw on some shoes and a jacket and go out to talk to her. After she pulls in and out of the parking space for about 2 minutes (obviously stalling)

I go upstairs to grab a flashlight and think about the situation. By the time I get downstairs, there's damage, but it's not terrible. I think we might be able to resolve this without insurance, so I go knock on her door (she IS my neighbor, so I know who she is). She refuses to answer, and I KNOW she's in there.

Whatever, take pictures, the whole nine yards. Do that and decide to try her door the next day. Same non-answer. I leave a note with the case number and my info, if she has any questions or anything. As I walk back to my apt, I hear her door open and she takes the note and closes the door before I can get back out there.

Yesterday

1. Can she simply point to her now-fixed car and say she didn't do it? I have photographic proof of both cars' damage
2. Since the damage on my car could be considered minimal (under my $500 deductible)
3. If the case DOES end up dismissed, and a witness (other than myself). I feel pretty good about my chances, but I need advice.

Before you say it, but her denial and avoidance are driving me insane. Also, the apt staff insinuated that she's a troublemaker and has done this many times before.


**TL;DR: Saw my neighbor hit my car

EDIT: Sorry for the radio silence; yesterday was spent with insurance and handling this.

Alright

I was born female but I was born with an [imperforate hymen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen#Anatomic_anomalies). It was so complete that until I was 15, it was bad). The trauma of past visits to the hospital (diagnosed psych disorder) combined with this one and the incredible gender confusion after it gave me a strong phobia of hospitals.

Now I'm 21. I've never had a follow up exam like I was supposed to, had x-rays for my spine [almost panic attack, drank a lot afterward], another visit to the psychward [fffffffuuuuuuu]). I wasn't able to see my grandma when she fell down a flight of stairs. I'm not able to go see her in the Alheimer's ward right now even though she may only have a few months left. I wasn't able to go with my boyfriend when he cut open his arm with a sword while dueling. I can't drive down the street next to a hospital without blanking out in fear and possibly getting into a car wreck. I can't go to the little clinic when I have a 104.7 F fever. I can't see or hear an ambulance without feeling anxious. I'm nervous as hell around doctors and nurses even when they're off duty. If I know someone is in a medical profession, they make me nervous (except dentists, no idea why).

I know I should go to the gyno. I know that logically. I have trouble dealing with the fact that I even have lady parts much less have anyone look at them. I don't like the fact that I've never been tested for VD. I don't like the fact that I could have cancer and not know it. I LOVE the fact that I only have to deal with a period once ever 3-ish months for 3-4 days but I'm pretty sure that's not normal. It might be just my body knowing how much I hate it. I hope so.

We knew after the first price raise that we needed to find something else but due to how much money was going out versus coming in

The problem comes in when he wants us to pay as renters  until the house is sold.  He is not lowering the payment so that we can save money to get into a new place.  So my wife and I started calling banks in order to try and get a loan, but we can't use one of them for this since we're not starting a business in a developing country.  I talked to a lawyer too.  He pretty much said what I already knew as far as any legal action is concerned.  Which is nothing.  Our word versus my in-laws word since it was all a verbal agreement.  Even though we have  the stubs from the money orders we sent, there is nothing that can be done.  We had hopes for one more local bank that we went to today, but we got turned down there as well.  

Our last option is following up on the advice of a friend to try the local housing authority.

1367208829.0,1dbgce,my roommate/flatmate may or may not have raped his girlfriend.,alien6,24,8,27,"**UPDATE:**  Spoke to the girl

**Original post:** I call him my roommate, and separate bedrooms and bathrooms.  I guess in the UK it would be called a ""flatmate,"" though that's all just semantics.  The walls are pretty thin.  We got along cordially; we're not the best of friends but there weren't any big problems between him and me.  

My roommate's relationship with his girlfriend has been rocky ever since she got pregnant and they aborted it.  Last week she told him they were through, since she kept coming over, watching TV together, hosting mutual friends, laughing and joking, and having sex (thin walls), but she still got upset and said some things to the effect of ""You're not making me feel like I want to stay in this relationship""

A couple of hours ago

With the thin walls, but she kept saying it.  ""Get off me!  Get off me!""  At one point it sounded like she was being muffled.

I couldn't sit by, those aren't normal sex noises.  The door was slightly open but I wasn't in a position to see anything.

There was a pause.  My roommate said, but there was some kind of quiet murmuring that I couldn't hear.  As far as I could tell, they weren't having sex any more.  I don't know if it was him talking, her talking, or both of them talking.  Not knowing what else to do, I packed up my stuff and left the apartment.

My roommate has never struck me as the type of person who would get angry or violent.  He's always been very laid back and friendly.  That's why I don't know what to do next.  I don't *think* he's the type to rape anyone but I heard all the signs.

**EDIT:**  To be a little more clear, dubstep, and netflix.  Until now they've tended to have frequent, loud sex, but ""get off of me"" was something I'd never heard her say before, much less ten times in a row.  

The more I think about it, it's finals week and I have my own shit to deal with.  It's been 17 hours and I still haven't been back to the apartment.

**UPDATE:**  Well, I stood outside and called in that I was sorry for barging in last night.  I instead heard his girlfriend say ""Um... okay.""  He wasn't there.  She was there, on his bed, eating chinese food, watching doctor who.  I asked her if everything was fine last night, and she said it was.  I told her to tell him I'm sorry for overreacting.

My girlfriend (not asking for relationship advice) has always had trouble with depression. Her mother is bipolar and she has been taking medicine against depression for almost 10 years. (she stopped taking them 2 years ago after things started to go uphill).

Ever since I knew her I've always tried to give her more confidence. Giving compliments

However things have gone downhill the last couple of weeks. She's in constant stress and she thinks that everything she does is wrong and nobody likes her. I try to help her as much as I can but she's crying about 5-6 times a day now. 

I've been trying to apply logic to the situation because most of her stress and insecurity is based on fear not logic. This always worked  for the last 1.5 years but not anymore. 

I can get her to calm down

Here's a situational example ; she was talking that she was not good enough to do her work, she would not have gotten a better contract with steady hours.

About four years ago, holiday's...). This stopped until I left to attend a University and had a mental break. I had convinced myself that one of these people had killed themselves and I was inconsolable and hospitalized for severe depression over it. I was traumatically scarred by this event and would spend hours thinking of my friend and missing her. I could not function to the point of spending days in a semi-catatonic state. I was stoned or drunk more than I was sober. I was not really suicidal but I was so depressed and saw no end in site, that I constantly cried and would seclude myself. I did not care about anything and my entire personality started changing. I wanted to be alone and did not like to be around others.

But then over about a three month period

One day

I was afraid to talk to anyone about my realization because, that I just could not remember. And even if I did remember something, I am afraid that it could just be another false memory.&gt;/p

I had done something similar when I was in High School. But it did not have the impact that my *friends* suicide had. I realized that some of the people/events in High School, is what really got to me.

I believe the trigger for my realization was that I was finally getting married to my fiancé of almost twenty years. Thinking of all of the times that she had dealt with me crying, having uncontrollable emotional outburst, being hospitalized, breaking up with her, verbal fights.... was really hard for me to admit to. I had put her through so much pain and had caused so many problems in our relationship because of this. I felt sick to think of all of the things that she had been put through. But I finally told her the truth and let the chips fall as they may. Not only did she completely forgiven me but she has not held any of it against me. We don't talk about it because she knows how ashamed I am about what I had done.

To my surprise, I started realizing how much was out there and how much I had missed out on while I was in this state. I have become really interested in science, astronomy, earth/planetary science's, paleontology, world history… I am no longer depressed, I don't have break down's. Trigger's such as dates, events..., the day we met... If I saw a car that was the same make/model… Seeing someone in public or on TV that looked like her or that had the same name. But now I can barely remember any dates

The reason that I am asking about this now, and if there are any more surprises in my brain that just haven't surfaced.

Background (Everything that follows has been independently verified for accuracy):

I grew up in a semi-poor family with a lot of violence between my parents. I don't think that my sister or I were abused but we witnessed; knife fights, screaming and yelling, my parents splitting up (or threatening to). I can't tell you the times that my father had pointed a gun at my mother and pulled the trigger - only to point the gun away at the last minute. Shooting into the wall or the car. I had not friends in elementary or middle school and was picked on because of economic difference's between myself and my classmates who overwhelmingly came from upper-middle class homes. We had lived in the state of Washington, Texas, South Carolina, Florida, but we always seemed to come back to our home in Western North Carolina eventually.
My mother left my father and moved to Florida with another man. She left me behind with my father (supposedly so he wouldn't come after her to get me) and on top of everything

I bounced from living with my father, mother, grandmother, uncle's and a family friend. No matter where I lived, I tried to be alone as possible by going for walks or riding my motorcycle on the backroads and logging roads. I became less isolated in High School, where I started making friends and dating. I was able to change my personality based on the group of people I was with. So I had no trouble fitting in with the goth's, jocks, bands geeks, riding four wheeler's into the backwoods or discussing Edgar Allen Poe.

My nights have been plagued with nightmare's since I was a very small child. All night, running from danger, or begging for their lives. The dreams are always horrifically detailed and run through my head like a movie with; beginnings, middles, ends, plots, dialog

In my Junior year is when I made up my first friend, going for rides in the forest, having dinner… One of these people really but I barely knew here and had only dated her a few times. The rest were not based on any of the friends that I had or girls that I dated. I didn't talk about these people to my real friends but would spend a lot of time listening to music or riding around thinking that these people were as real as anyone else.

I met my fiancé three years before my *friend* took her life. I didn't talk about my *friend* to my fiancé because my *friend* just happened to be an ex-girlfriend who I broke up with because I was cared for her so much that I wouldn't let myself give in to those feelings

I believed these friends existed until about four years ago. I could tell you their birthday's, their family lives and history. I can still remember hanging out with them, cruising with them, having sex, going to the beach… I could tell you the quirks that they had… Honestly, I think that if I wrote it all down, I could write their biographies in vivid detail.

tl;dr - my best friend in High School

The law firm representing the previous owner is telling my friend that he needs to send them the checks instead so they can deposit the rent into a trust until the dispute is settled.  They have demanded that he stop payment on the current rent check and submit all payments to them.

My friend is now caught in the middle.  He fears that stopping payment on the check will give the bank cause to kick him out.  Banks will apparently look for any minor breach of the lease agreement to evict tenants of foreclosed homes (shitty

So long story short; I must have been asleep the day they covered home buying in the How To Be An Adult class, because that is exactly what I am.  This is the biggest purchase of my life and I would like to represent the culminated wisdom of my fellow redditors and handle it like a pro. 

Some basic questions (but please fill me in on every nuance):

* Who

* Do I get the mortgage pre-approved?  Does that mean I have to get a house for exactly that amount or can it be less? (or more?)

* Really, or agent, or what?  I am not even sure what the difference is or if they are all the same thing.  Who helps me do what?  And do they represent my desire to buy a house or are there to facilitate the selling of the house for the seller?

* I read in one of the guides that it is possible to not even need...one of those things from above...if you hire a real estate lawyer to draw up all the paperwork.  True or not?  Hazards?

* Can closing costs be part of the mortgage or is doing that just dumb?

* Is there some kind of government program that can assist me with making intelligent decisions about this?  I mean

And barring all that

only child to aging parents?",4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/inf3i/how_can_i_do_what_i_want_with_my_life_as_an_adult/,"**TL;DR - Need advice on how to make life decisions as an adult when you're the only child of aging parents who will make you feel guilty for choices that make it harder for you to care for them.**

I am well into my adult life (been living on my own for over 12 years now) and am feeling somewhat trapped in life by my parents. The major issue is that I'm an only child and as my parents, they'll have nobody but me to care for them. 

My dad will always be fine. He's pretty laid back and as a former military guy and retired law enforcement he can take care of things. He'll always want to be able to take care of himself

My mom is a completely different story. She's always been fairly emotionally fragile and the littlest of things can send her into crying fits. If I don't call her or see her (e-mail and IM don't count) once a week, even if I call or visit to take her to dinner, then I'm a terrible son and don't love her. She has spent most of her life worrying about things and continues to do so. If I don't call her when I get home from a trip, she thinks I'm dead and when I finally do talk to her I get an earful about how if I really loved her I would call so she wouldn't worry. Once we had a conversation about her using a grocery service so she didn't have to haul heavy items home from the store while my dad was away on business and she got upset and started crying because it meant I didn't want to come take her to the store. The only issue where my dad comes in is that he gets mad at me whenever I ""make"" my mom upset. So he won't get upset about me for stupid little things like my mom does, but he does get mad at me when I do something that upsets her. She doesn't drive because she has panic attacks on the road. She also doesn't fly because she's too afraid. 

Remember

I've never lived more than a few hours away from them. This is partly because I've been made to worry about something happening to them and me not being nearby. The other part is that I've been made to worry that something will happen to me and they won't be nearby. These are both things my mom has told me flat out whenever I've discussed living further away.  

As I've gotten older

All that said, the weather... and am seriously thinking about jumping ship and moving all the way to the other side of the country. Also, after dealing with the diagnosis of these psychological problems and the issues that caused them to come out so strongly in the first place, I really feel like a fresh start would do a lot of good for me. 

I just can't get past the guilt of leaving my parents and being so far away in an emergency. And this is just the guilt in my own head. The guilt that they're going to throw on me will be so much worse. I could always get to them in under a day if I needed to

Essentially it was either this or death for him. I believe he knows today why he is in there instead of blaming everyone else like most addicts do. But this is beside the point.

We took his wife (lets call her Amanda) and our two grand-children in (boy is 2 and girl is 5). We had absolutely no issues with this. We knew it would be hectic but things would fall into place. Or so we thought.

Amanda also has an Oxycontin addiction and has now pretty much been gone for over a week. She never even said bye to her children. Just pretty much up and left. She came by yesterday and said she would be going to rehab today and saw her son for about an hour. Her Daughter was at her parents and was suppose to head over there after wards. She didn't. And of course no one has heard from her today.

Start of the story: 19 years old. I am 21 now.

**Relationship background**

From the beginning I warned her that I wouldn't be a good boyfriend because I didn't want to hurt her in the end. But she persisted and we got together. We loved each other very much.

We knew each other really well, when I told my mother about my new girlfriend, my mother said she didn't like her, and basically told me that I should break up with her. I did. This is because I was someone else back in the day, I couldn't think for myself, really. My mother is really controlling.

I broke up with my girlfriend

The secret was looming at the back of my mind. We saw each other less because of the guilt I had built up. I felt guilty of lying to my mother. But we kept on going with the relationship. We saw each other two or three times a week. Sometimes less than that. But we were texting/IMing all the time.

I would cut our time together, I thought my ex was OK with the way things are, seeing each other infrequently. I said I would one day tell my mother.

Eventually it broke, I thought we could get through it. But she broke up with me after 11.5 months of being together.

Weeks later

Fast forward 3 months from the breakup. It's the end of the summer

Then we break up again

**Seeking happiness**

Fast forward to today. I've got a full time job that I love doing with a company I love working for. I get paid a lot. All should be well. I'm supposed to be happy and grateful for this. But I'm not. I'm still hurting from the relationship. I can't forgive myself. I really dislike who I am.

Everything I've done seems like to be a bandage that just falls off. I've tried new hobbies, I'm extremely unhappy. It feels like I'm in perpetual unhappiness. I've tried confiding in my friends, but it doesn't work. I've tried deep contemplation with myself. I don't know what else I could try.

I thought I was burned out from work. I tried taking a vacation

I'm trying to count my blessings

1369246772.0,1eukmy,Manger of a store I frequent identified me to her staff after I made a complaint.,BakedAlaska,17,1,22," I started going to a nearby liquor store daily about seven years ago. It is convenient as they carry the things I want and I live in a semi rural location. The next nearest is six miles away.

 Within the last year

Last month they rolled a high dollar motor cycle into the business and offered it up as raffle item. Soon after on one of my visits I witnessed four guys all standing around the entry box with full pads of these tickets. One ran out while I was there and was offered another full pad. They were clearly friends of the cashiers. I mentioned nothing and finished my transaction and left. 

About a week later I was in at an unusual time and encountered the manager. I asked what their policy was with regards to the raffles and was confirmed one purchase one ticket. I reported that she may have a problem with some of the evening staff and told her what I witnessed I gave no identifying information as to whom was the problem staff. I left that for her discretion.

Last evening as I entered the store the two staff looked at me odd and started giggling. I heard them make reference to ""the girls"" as that is what I told the manager. ""The girls on the night shift"". All they have working there are females and in no way was this an identifying comment. After I selected my items and placed them on the counter I remembered my wife requested ice cream. I moved towards the freezer

This has put me in a shitty position of being uncomfortable shopping there. I really don't blame the night staff they are immature simple little people. I do blame the manager for identifying me. It seems to me unprofessional.

I only know this because she would lock the pup in her bathroom when she was at work for 9 hours and I could hear it from above. I have never seen her outside walking her dog. I am outside with my own dog and son quite a bit
At the beginning of this month she started keeping the dog outside on her balcony for the 9 hours a day she was gone at work instead of in the bathroom. One day I was on my own balcony and looked down to see the dog outside, and with a water bowl) And all I could smell was dog shit. Now I have a dog, so I immediately checked my shoes, but no.... then I looked down. My neighbors balcony is covered in dog shit. Well not covered, but about 6-8 separate piles. And if it's pooping there, it is also peeing, onto the first floor's patio. Classy. So I called my building and the building manager. She said she would see to it being cleaned up.

Since my main account can be linked to me i opted for taking a throwaway for this. In the half year i have had 6-7 short psychological events that deeply disturbed me. They occur random and are usually happening this way:

* 30-40 seconds of a strong feeling that ""something is wrong""
* This is followed by a strange smell that i cannot identify. I sometimes think it smells like ""summer"" or a bbq but i can't identify it for sure. It also feels like my nostrils are irritated while i smell it
* for about 3 minutes i get a strong sensation of something along the line of fear and discomfort
* While this is happening i have strange thoughts and memory occuring that feel like remembering a dream that i had forgotten and i can never say if they are real memorys or memorys of dreams. After this is over i can't remember a thing i thought of.
* During all of this i feel a strong sense of disorientationand discomfort

I don't want to violate the reddit policy regarding medical advice so i just want to know if anyone has experienced something simmiliar or can identify the problem so i can find out if it's physical or psychological. To give you a little bit of background information here's what i can think of that might possibly be linked to it.

* i have had depressions for most of my teenage and young adult life (i am 21). I never saw a psychologist about it as i never felt it was beyond what i was able to deal with.
* i smoke a lot of weed
* i had a bad year so far
* I'm not in a good shape physically (though not hopelessly fat ) 

Does this match anything you know of be it physical or psychological as i don't even know where to start researching or wether i should go to a psychologist or a doctor about this. I can't trigger these events in any way i know of and their appearence seems utterly random to me.

every input is very much appreciated!

* **He made me play tennis for most of my childhood.** I hated tennis. I hated drilling to get better. I hated going to tournaments, he would get livid. He'd be angry constantly. He'd tell me I had made the biggest mistake of my life and tell me how disappointed he was in me. He'd start screaming at me about 50% of the time he took me out to practice, but when I stopped playing my junior year in high school he would be mad at me CONSTANTLY. The most frustrating part was that he took responsibility for being my coach, but he sucked. Not just in tennis skills, but in knowing how to win and improve as a player. To this day, I have NEVER gotten a straight answer as to why he made me play this fucking sport.

* **He emasculates me constantly.** He'd threaten to beat the shit out of me. He'd get in my face, push me, grab me, stuff like that. He'd yell as loud as he could all the time. I never got a true beating, just slaps really. But the fear of always getting the shit kicked out of me by someone much bigger than me always scared me senseless. Even now, when we're the same height, I just see him as a much bigger person totally capable of ending my life.

* **He guilt trips me.** I would get blamed for a ton of things that were, get in a fight with my mom, and then say ""See what you did to your mother you little prick?"" The other day, him and my mom were getting into a fight while I was visiting home (15min away from me). I told him I was going to go back to my dorm because I didn't want to be there while they were arguing. In response, he said ""You're going to regret making your parents suffer so much."" tl;dr: he'd get angry for no good reason, and blame me for making him act in ways he knew were bad.

* **He uses my mom as a hostage.** I've told him to fuck off a few times, he makes my mom's life a living hell. If I try to call her on her cell phone, he'll wrestle the phone away from her, tell me how upset she is with me, and unload on me verbally until I hang up. She doesn't have the strength to deal with his temper, even though she's a lot smarter than him.

* **He demands apologies all the time.** Nothing much more to say here. For the bullshit listed above

What keeps me coming back to this relationship, or claims to. My sister and my mother tell me how unreasonable I'm being when I don't make amends with him. But I'm tired of it. I don't want to walk on eggshells with my father, or anyone.

I knew I wanted to go into computer science at a very early age, I pursued it when I went into college. I'm getting great grades at a great college, and I'm already getting job offers with very good pay. I don't see what benefits I can get from maintaining a relationship with my father that I couldn't earn on my own. The only thing that keeps me from not talking to him is how badly he treats my mother when I do.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking for. I hate him. I don't want to talk to him. I want to forget he ever existed. But I can't because my mom will NEVER separate from him.

In May

**In Aug, and she said they would call me when they corrected it.

OK cool. That's settled. A few weeks later I get a new bill. I think it's the corrected amount. **Instead, plus the previous amount that I hadn't paid.

So I call up and freak out on the phone. The lady on the phone said she understood why I'd be upset and she would have someone else fix it for me

I was upset because this gas company (**AmeriGas**) also charges $10 to read the meter on the side of the house. Every house in the neighborhood has a meter. You wouldn't think they would charge this... so I was upset they're charging me $10/mo to read the meter and then give me inaccurate results!

This morning I went out to the side of the house to see what the meter actually says. The gauge says: 21936

My previous bill was dated 20 days ago. The reading 20 days ago was 2191

Long story short, they've procrastinated for almost two months without telling me what the situation is, and meanwhile it appears that the gas readings on my bill match up, and they're making a massive profit off me that they wouldn't have otherwise had. If there is a gas leak, they should have fixed it or told me about it. Last year we thought the garage smelled like gas, and we called AmeriGas. The tech couldn't find any leak, so they charged me $250 for the call. They literally punish consumers who report leaks.

I don't know what to make of this situation and I don't want to pay the $1600. That bill is larger than I would spend on gas for an entire year!

1333393500.0,rpwis,24 year old college student struggling with ADHD,Gromlick,19,3,41,"I know

I think I fit the bill of your typical smart lazy student. I glided through high school on a bare minimum effort, I've come close to flunking out entirely. I've been suspended once for a semester, and lost my financial aid finishing the semester after that. For about a year I paid my way (by working at Taco Bell) through one class at a time while going to the school's psychology clinic for some help (they were the ones who diagnosed me, ADHD PI, or ADD)... And it did, at least to a degree. I managed to get myself a little more organized, but I had a hard time getting any of their planning strategies up. I got my financial aid back, and they seemed to think I was ready to go it alone... Trying as hard as I could muster

This semester has been worse. I've been sick, and to top all of that I'm taking the hardest classes I ever have. The bright side is that I actually feel challenged in my classes for once. The downside is that I've missed a lot of class, and anxiety is really piling up. I've been skipping out of fear of reprisal. I haven't met with a partner for a huge class project in weeks because I feel afraid to talk to him.

As for symptoms: I can't listen to lectures. I've tried. Even when I'm interested I'll zone out. Textbooks are better, or start daydreaming, or just focus on nothing. I'll lose entire days of work at a time. I think I have anxiety issues, though the clinic didn't seem to think so. I'm afraid to go to my classes because I haven't been going to my classes. I think I had a mild panic attack this past Friday in one of my classes. I just couldn't stand to be in the room. I left early without saying anything.  I've even lied to my fiancee about a few classes because of how I know she will react... 

For less serious problems - I forget the simplest of things. all the time. Things, or that the pot is still on, I'll forget to pay bills until I receive an overdue notice, I'll forget about homework I was supposed to do, I'll forget I was supposed to give someone a ride. I forgot to make a reservation for me and my girlfriend for our fifth anniversary. Turned out nearly every restaurant we wanted to go to were closed that night. That turned into one of the biggest fights we've ever had. 

I'm an absolute slob. I can't finish anything I start - no matter how enthusiastic I am when I start. I lose myself when I'm in the middle of a conversation. My fiancee accuses me of not paying attention to her when she talks

I'm sorry

So what should I do? I feel like the clinic didn't help. I don't feel entirely comfortable with the idea of prescription drugs

When I was eighteen years old, seeing how they had been dating for some time and I had gotten to know him...I supported the relationship fully. Refusing to break up with him and outraged at my views

We both worked at a call center, I had NO idea this was happening. 

So

I on the other hand struggled to pay off those bills and moved into my parents house so I wouldn't be homeless. I couldn't afford the apartment by myself. After three months of verbal abuse and screaming

After a week...I found him with our roommate straddling him. On our bed. 

With no where else to go I stayed with him. A few months of back and forth emotional torture...I have once again moved back into my parents home. The rules are harsh but after some family counseling things have gotten much better between us. 

All of this has been in the past two years or so. I just turned twenty a few months ago and I'm really trying to get into college. I attended spring quarter at my local community college and walked out with a 3.8. 

Here's the where things get...more difficult. My parents will only house me if I'm attending college but they refuse to help pay for my tuition. I have been trying like mad to get a job but it hasn't happened. I've even resorted to selling my things to try to raise money for Fall Quarter. If I'm not going to class by mid-September... I get kicked out. And my parents make too much money to qualify for any heavy aid from the school.

However, some higher ups in the business are making a case to try to get him fired. He's been suspected of stealing money and product, and putting the blame on employees. However, I don't know if I can stand to wait until it happens. 

He often yells at people for things that aren't their fault. For example, when I work.) and he yelled at me for 20 minutes about how we don't let him know when things need restocking, even though it was my first night there **all week**. He pulls shit like this all the time. He's yelled at clerks for lesser things. He also tends to say and do things that are incredibly unprofessional. (he takes 2-hour lunch breaks, and leaves early. He once told me he was ""keeping an eye on me, because I'm the rogue"", but wouldn't tell me why, and said he wanted to 'see the look on my face' when he explained it.) He hears things over the camera microphones

And today, so she didn't think I was ditching her to do all the work. Of course my boss overhears this. (He has mics set up so he can listen to us in his office. This was during the week I was working with them.) Today, I learned from another coworker (Who I'm good friends with.) that they were making fun of me for it during the week she was working. I was devistated, embarrased, and ashamed. However, I don't want to take it to the higher-ups because A) I only have the word of a coworker to go off of, and B) I don't want to get the other girl fired. She's got a kid

Between the bullshit my boss pulls, it makes me want to walk out of my job. I'm trying to save up to move back home though. (I live in the midwest. I'm from the northwest.) I'm getting fed up, and I'm not sure how much more I can take. I don't think I'd be able to find a job with the same hours and pay as I get there.

Without wanting to reveal too much personal information about him on the internet

It started off gradually a couple weeks ago, and convinced himself that this was the key to making millions off of FOREX trades. He's been frantically scribbling numbers on paper that make absolutely no sense. It was bizarre, but prior to this he had seemed to be a perfectly sane, very intelligent college student. It then started to degrade a bit further, he started to sporadically mention things like evil represented in the Forex currency charts, but only occasionally. I suggested that he seek out a therapist, which he said he would

Things continued to get worse, sent me a good 25+ pages of semi-coherent text messages and said he would not sleep in our house anymore, instead opting to sleep on benches at the college campus we attend a few blocks away. I hunted him down and convinced him to come home. The next day, things seemed to be getting better. He was no longer spouting crazy shit, but he was obsessively watching forex charts from dawn to dusk. 

Then last night happened. ~~He received a phone call about a relative of his having committed suicide, chain smoking at least 6 packs of cigarettes last night, but I've been idling in the chat he's in. From what I gather, both from the chat and the few things he's said it seems he thinks the Forex brokers are after him and his family, and that they may have [kidnapped, I guess?] a member of his family, and he wants them to take him instead. 'In blood', lots of random numbers

I'm fairly sure at this point that he needs to be hospitalized, who kicked him out a couple months ago after a huge drama. I know I should contact him, but I'm afraid it would infuriate my roommate. What do I do?

I am a 23 year old in college. I live at my parent's home currently. My brother and my sister both have autism spectrum disorders

My sister has unfortunately had serious anger management issues for over 10 years now. On a regular basis

The amount of stress this has placed on my parents (as well as from other reasons) has been perhaps too much for one couple to handle. My mother tends to be very forgetful, cold, and antagonistic, especially when dealing with my mother.

My mother being a bit scatterbrained has built up resentment in my father towards her. He wants her to do what he wants her to do, complaining, and making demands. My mother is codependent, she strives to always do what my father wants and make him happy. When she is unable to please my father, or when he becomes mean or cold to her, she has a very difficult time handling it emotionally. She becomes so stressed that she will be unable to focus on things and will forgetful enough that she'll ask someone a question and forget their answer to it nearly immediately, requiring her to ask them again. This has created sort of a vicious cycle in my mother failing to do things my father wants because of her being stressed out.

I've realized that I have been in denial about my father's actions being abuse for many years. I am trying to do something about this now, that they don't have time to go to therapy. I don't really know what to do about this.

I've been looking for the past hour for a popular forum where I could ask for advice, I'm going to try to put it on paper the best I can without making my post too long.


When I first started attending BYU I very much believed in the Mormon religion. So taking religion classes, emotionally, spiritually and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made. But now I'm kind of stuck because I'm still attending there and I don't know if I should try to transfer or not. Here are the pros and cons of staying at BYU.


PROS

- VERY cheap (2k tuition a semester (if you're mormon) 260$ rent)
- A good school academically 

- My GPA is not very good (2.4 with a lot of withdraws) so it will be hard to transfer into another school of its caliber.

- If I transferred some credits wouldn't transfer over

- I have a good amount of friends there who I all love.


CONS

- Virtually no one believes the same things I do. This brings a huge disconnect to others (even my close friends I cannot connect to them on a higher level b/c of this).

- You need to go to church otherwise you can't keep attending the school. They take attendance at church (although I'm not sure if that's just for statistical purposes).

- Can't drink or do drugs (not that I'm interested in doing hard drugs but I would very much like to be able to smoke weed with friends/alone w/o anyone bothering me).

- I have this general feeling that it's holding me back (b/c of the belief thing) b/c I am pretty much still forced to associate with the church and with a lot of those ideologies

- Limited ways to have fun b/c of it's strict ""honor code"" which involves no drinking

- I want to open my mind as much as possible and develop my ideas and beliefs but I feel like the university almost discourages this.

- Have to take religion classes (rather

Here's my story: As a kid growing up in school I had almost no friends. Maybe 1 or 2 and was ridiculed in grade school a lot. My parents were never home and when they were home they abused me. The severity of abuse was not horrible, slapped/hit in the face, chased after and hit in the corner, thrown outside totally in the nude (7 yrs old) and a variety of other things. Never had to go to the hospital for broken bones--they were good at hiding visable bruising. 

I had some pretty severe seperation anxiety, as the thoughts were obsessive. 

Somewhere around highschool I had a huge paradym shift and realized that ""winning"" ""manipulating"" and ""lying"" was a way to allievate some of the stress and anxiety i felt day to day. I ridiculed other students, and getting into fights. I went from 3 friends to the entire school being my friend, thinking i was hilarous, and knowing that i was popular. 

I continued this throughout H.S., i also have a hard time staying at one job. In college i experimented with almost every drug, oxies, acid, cocaine, mdma, list goes on and on. I had another paradym shift and got increasingly depressed and had suicidal ideations all day everyday. 

I went to therapy, ive also surpressed many childhood memories that were more intense, like running around with a knife after my sister, holes in the wall, throwing things, and a bunch of other stuff from when i was younger. 

I've been told i suffer from anxiety, and if i do, it is mostly sadness and/or displaced rage. 

The point of this post was to ask if anyone else has had a similar story of their life, or the things that they did to remedy the problems of dissociation. I'm not sure if I can classify myself as a sociopath, because according to my therapist, the reasons that i lash out violently is because i am very empathetic, it's just that in order to cope i've developed dissociative patterns. 

I've read up a lot on sociopaths and I think i fit the mold for certain aspects

She originally claimed that when our daughter moved in the summer, that Ann cut herself in distress from it, but stopped at the beginning of the school year.

I was often bullied in my middle and high school years. I've reflected on my experiences a lot since then

This article is for anyone in middle or high school who is often targeted by bullies. There's other material on-line that you should read

Ultimately, this should have some value to those out there who are facing this dark side of human nature. Especially if you're as naive as I was!

When asked what she wished for, you will work on yourself.

When I think back, whether you win or lose. You have power because you control your mind and actions. We're going to develop that power. A good card player is not one who gets good cards, but one who knows how to play the cards he’s dealt. Aim to become someone who keeps his head up and handles whatever life throws at him.

SOME PERSPECTIVE

Kids can be remarkably vicious to each other. One reason is that they don't face serious consequences for behavior which, they make you that enemy, perhaps because you’re different, or perhaps because there’s nothing you have that they want. It may be ""wrong,"" but it's natural.

As Will and Ariel Durant write in ""The Lessons of History, you'll still conflict with people around you, thought perhaps not in such overt ways, so don't think conflict will end when you graduate. Get used to it now, and learn how to handle it well.

In public school, lawyers, entrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, accountants, presidents and homeless. As you go higher in education, you spend your days with people who are more and more just like you. If you make it to a post-doctoral program

If you're having trouble socializing in public school, you should interact with and learn from your classmates while you have the chance. After graduating from high school, you'll rarely get the chance to mix with so many different people.

Why do some people bully others? Each has his own reasons. There will always be people who want power over you. Some hurt others just because they can get away with it, but they need you, and that's why they won't leave you alone.

Not all bullies are simple scumbags; some are quite talented.  Though ethics teaches that we should use our abilities to help others

These are not excuses for their behavior, you might find something you can use. The highest form of warfare is to turn an enemy into a friend, so if you see an opportunity to reach out to a bully with understanding, for example, take it. You have nothing to lose.

**Your being bullied is not your fault. Consider that being bullied is just a lesson in the harsh realities of life. Your suffering comes from learning this lesson faster than most others.**

SURVIVAL

Ok

If you're being attacked by a group or someone with a weapon

If you're being abused by a teacher, go to your parents, the PTA, the town school board, or the police. Everyone has a boss or someone they're accountable to.

A word of caution, you're sure that he'll be arrested or severely disciplined.
If you go to an authority figure because of a simple bullying incident

Side note to parents: I've seen fathers being interviewed on TV state that they wouldn't help their sons if they were having trouble with a teacher.  They'd want the boy to learn how to fend for himself. I feel this is a mistake.  First, and the teacher is an adult.  Third, he's at a further disadvantage because he's in a teacher-student relationship.  If your son is having trouble with a teacher, HELP HIM.  Get involved and confront the teacher and/or principal. Let your son learn to be an adult by watching you, not by fighting with some creepy teacher.

THE FIGHT

Your first weapon is self-control. Control your emotions.
If you're not in control of yourself

Your second weapon is self-knowledge. Know thyself, and emotional strengths and weaknesses are. You need to understand yourself to fight back against bullies; use your strengths, and protect your weaknesses. What weaknesses can be worked on, and which must you live with? Accept your faults, and know that everyone has faults of their own.

Everyone is better than everyone else in some way. When in conflict

To defend yourself

Next is self-mastery. You're in a war, people will think of you as a great target, and the problem will spread. If a bully is attacking you alone, you can do whatever you want, but if there are other people watching, you must respond.

Learn to defend yourself physically -- try taking self-defense classes.  The idea is not so much to win fights, and make friends outside of school. It's also important for you to absorb the martial arts attitude: staying calm and in control of yourself.

You must be able to defend yourself verbally as well.  Google ""verbal judo"" and read up.

See the bully as a challenge

There are many ways that you can react to a bully. If you have mastered yourself

Don't be a passive victim. You can be a fighter, and tries to turn the situation in his favor.  If you lose, it's just a loss.

Get good at that game, but it takes different forms.  There will be not (so much) fighting and name-calling, but competing. And as now, the one who controls the conflict will most likely win.

PROTECT YOUR DEVELOPMENT

**Academics:** This comes first and foremost. You may not realize this but this might just be the most important time of your life. The young years are extremely important. Young people learn and grow much faster than adults, but it's tough, and would require a disproportionate amount of energy.

I'm not saying you should study all the time. Just don't let bullies sway you from doing what you want to do. Continue to speak up in class, ask that other kid out on a date, join clubs, pursue your hobbies outside of school.

You're in school for a reason -- take it seriously

Don't let anyone steal your experiences. Compete for them! Try to be the one who gets called on to help out with the science experiment. Experiences add to you; they are yours to be had. Don't let bullies impact your development. Use all the tools of the last section to prevent that from happening.

**Physical:** Sometimes, but for survival situations. You're probably not a sports jock, and that's okay, but everyone needs exercise. A healthy mind requires a healthy body. Get involved in athletics at your school. If your situation is such that you can't do that, exercise on your own, or join that martial arts class.

**Social:** If bullying gets pervasive it can cause social isolation, make friends, and experiment with leadership roles. Heard about emotional intelligence (EQ)?  It's important for success, so don't neglect it. How you spend your time and who you spend your time with are two of the most important decisions you will make on a daily basis. If the social scene at school is hopeless then participate in activities outside of school.

Some bullies may take over a conversation by talking over you or steering the conversation to subjects that exclude you

Conversation and making friends takes confidence

CLOSING THOUGHTS

A word of warning -- when I was in school, I hung out with anyone who would hang out with me. I thought if someone didn't bully me, they're friends, but this turned out to be very wrong. A true friend is someone who accepts you as you are, and doesn't require you to lower yourself. If they demand a price from you, they are not your friends. Toxic friends may not be bullies, per se, we teach people how to treat us. A friend will listen. If you find yourself feeling hurt by a ""friend"" too often

One more thing to watch out for: **bullying can leave you emotionally raw.** You'll become more sensitive, he may not be trying to bully you. Perhaps he's just challenging you to improve your throw. Don't become over-sensitive. It can damage relationships with real friends.

Life is long

And forget about the bullies. Everyone has their own problems to deal with. Don't be vengeful. It's been said that success is the best revenge

Because one of the Vice Presidents of the company I worked for before was the college roommate of this companies Head of H.R. I found out it was *because* I was overqualified that I did not get the job

Since then I have applied to hundreds of jobs and rarely even get a call back.  Last week the contracting firm that represented me in my previous job set me up with an interview for a position that I was qualified for and that I had lots of previous experience with.  I thought that the interview went very

I emailed the woman who represents me at the contracting firm and asked her if there was a problem with my resume or if there was a certification I could get that would help my chances.  She emailed me back and said that the people who interviewed me loved the resume and thought that my technical knowledge was a perfect match

I don't know what to do.  Did they want me to beg, and that I have no job.

I am so depressed right now I can't tell if I am numb or hysterical.  I figured these people would have wanted someone who was professional.  I would have begged.  I would have gotten out the pom-poms and cheered this company and them.

1344433834.0,xvpk9,I have zero motivation to do anything at work. Worried it is getting worse.,Hirmetrium,16,4,11,"Right

I'm 24, and work at a big corporation in the town. It's a desk job, which means a PC and.. internet. I'm not a very outgoing person and I struggle to articulate or explain myself sometimes. I have a bad habit of talking first, thinking after. 

Over the last few months, who can make things difficult, but hey, relationships are not easy right? I spend my spare time playing video games (or used to) and surfing the internet.

But more and more over these months, getting in on time, and when I get to work I have no sense of urgency or work ethic. It's gotten to the point where I am disgusted with myself. I think I try to rationalize it too much - ""everybody does it"", ""why should I try when nobody else does"", etc. I want to stop. I want to find the motivation that got me out of bed and into work when I started 6 years ago. But thinking back, I have never had this motivation. I don't know what to do.

I can't ask my friends, none of the fun. Even nowadays, I'm so lucky, fortunate, even spoiled, yet this still weighs heavily on me. I feel like I've missed out. I don't want to tell my ""work friends"" or my parents because I just feel as if they would be ashamed of me.

I like my job - I like the people I work with, I'm writing this while at work - what sort of impression does that give?

I guess I'll start it off quick; I've got a terrible procrastination problem. 

It really started to manifest itself in the first year of college. I had just graduated from a private school with a 4.0 GPA. As an only child

When the courses started, so I decided to head off to the library to go over the notes and catch up. 

I instead goofed off and proceeded to waste the day. Night came

This very quickly stacked and ended up having me skip almost entire weeks

Since I had never gotten anything lower than a B

I failed every single class.

During this period is when I think I started becoming depressed. I was suspended from school

Even with the classes being easier, or fear of failure. All I know is that I'm probably going to repeat the same this semester. Then I'd really be stuck.

I don't know what to do. I've talked with counselors, medication, or if I just gotta kick myself in the balls every morning.

A few days later, I also made a point to pick up my birth control. I asked my dad to stop on his way home and get my antibiotics, since they weren't going to ready until later and I didn't feel like waiting around. 

When he got home, the antibiotics I was put on had an interaction warning when being taken with the birth control I was put on. When the pharmacist told my dad about the interaction, he had no idea what was going on, as the name of the medicine was nothing he knew I was taking. He came home and looked up the name and realized what I had done. It was my mom, however that began attacking me. She threw my antibiotics at me and told me what my dad had found out. She continued the rest of the evening to torment me, telling me I was disgusting for sleeping with someone after only a month (I've been with my boyfriend longer than that, but she told me that she and my dad had known what I was doing all the nights I told them I was staying at my friends house right after I started dating him) and asking me if I would marry someone after only a month, in the eyes of God. She doesn't even know about the two other people I've slept with. She also told me that when I didn't ask her to come to the doctor with me, not only finding the issues of Cosmo I own

Thankfully, as well as full blown fights. The only bit my father had to say in all this was ""There will be no premarital sex in my house"". That was right after he found out, and since then hasn't said anything else about it to me. I've told him what my mom has been doing to me, and he's tried talking to her and has said we as a family need to work on our communication and acceptance of one another. 

Tonight was the worst, my mom had tried to start four fights just with me, as well as a few with my dad. Eventually I came to her and told her if things were going to be this way, I was going to start staying at school full time.  I can't take all the fighting, and I can see that me being around doesn't exactly make people here happy. She, of course, started going on about how it's my fault, my dad told me I was crying too hard to see to drive anywhere, I left the room and went and curled up in my bed.

I guess I just don't know what to do at this point. I guess it just blows my mind that anyone could treat their child this way. Any thoughts of what to do now?

1332533383.0,rag9v,I have anger issues. Amongst other things. How do you deal with anger in a healthy way?,AngryBarnacle,16,1,21,"I will try to make this brief

Background:

-childhood history of sexual
-no models for positive coping mechanisms
-sullen and moody teenager with some suicidal thoughts.
-we always lived out in the boonies, I often liked being alone
-mother and stepfather divorced when I was 18. 
-little brother died in a car accident in my early twenties. He was 16
-now on third long-term partner who says ""You have anger issues.""
-given ultimatum by one partner (second long-term partner) to seek anger management
-suffered from depression and anxiety disorder
-got help from a therapist plus Celexa and Ristoril
-made some life changes: started dating a man who was a longtime friend and my number one supporter, and filling my life with activities that could cultivate a sense of eudaimonia, such as gardening and painting. 
-stopped seeing that therapist and stopped the medication a year ago. I have had very few setbacks - down days


The Current Situation:

I still get angry so quickly, possibly days, possibly weeks, I get worked up about it, to the point of blasting my partner with angry venting or giving him an icy cold shoulder. My anger clouds my mind, overwhelms my reasoning, and makes me want to punch and kick things. 

Additionally

(I have started seeing a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. My boyfriend knows as do a couple close friends

I have a tendency to obsess over perceived injustices (obsessive thinking happens in anxiety disorders, or change something on me at the last minute. I also hate it when people abuse my time or my things. I don't like it when other invade my privacy or even visit unannounced. I have my boundary lines, and when people cross them, I get MAD. 

But I don't necessarily voice it. My boyfriend's parents are big perpetrators to me right now. I spent years defining the lines with my mother, who are generally well-meaning people (though his mother is neurotic and he's a mama's boy). When they ""trespass against me,"" I am as gracious as I could possibly be, but my boyfriend will feel the heat of my anger later (I am so lucky to have someone who will help me through this rather than run screaming the other direction).

Also, he thought I was someone indifferent toward marriage, and I was. But that's changed, and I've voiced this to him. He still hasn't gotten around to proposing even though he says he wants to marry me, and though I suppose that would be disappointing for most people, I AM PISSED. I watched my boyfriend's cousin propose to his girlfriend just this past Saturday, and I was so angry I could barely speak to my boyfriend for the next hour. He knew it. I tried breathing exercises and reasoning, and I do to an extent

Yesterday, she is off the lease and I can live in peace again.

I am worried about the safety of my personal belongings, and I've watched her pop morphine and oxycontin on a daily basis. It didn't affect me, and she seems to be able to do her job fine while on it, so I never really gave much of a shit. (Fun Fact: her second job is assistant director for a latchkey program for underprivileged elementary school kids...)

But she's always had serious temper issues. She's been arrested for assault before

These days, and then spends hours in her bathroom doing whatever she is buying. (I might add that her parents have had to help her pay her rent more than once during this six month lease...)

How can I protect my shit (I alone furnished the apartment, couch, 8 ft bean bag chair etc...) from her wrath? I also have a special needs cat that I'm worried she may hurt. I have caught her intentionally grossly over-feeding her (out of spite?), and now she no longer has access to the cat food.

I've posted this here



I was written a ticket in Pitt County, he had to write me a ticket. I also explained to him that this has happened before, where the DMV said I didn't have insurance (when I did) and that it was probably a hiccup in the system. While he was writing the ticket I remembered that the other officer called my insurance company to clear everything up and told me to just sort things out with the DMV, so it was too late for him to call my Insurance company. When he gave me the ticket he told me all I had to do was to turn it in with a form to the DA and it would be dismissed, no problem. Two weeks later I returned to Greenville (I live in Raleigh.) to give them my FS-1 form and I thought all was well.



Until now. I am applying to Apartments in Asheville, so I called the DA to make sure everything was taken care of. When I called, it was confirmed that it was dismissed but the only way for it to be removed from my record was to see an attorney.



Today I called the Attorney General's office and was directed to the SBI Expungement Office and was told to call the Clerk in Pitt County regarding needing legal counsel. I did so and was told that I could submit the forms myself. The forms are crazy legalese and I would hate to mess them up



Here is my question: Why do I have to pay someone to remove a charge from my background, but I was insured, meaning that I really should have never received the ticket. What can I do to get it removed without having to pay a lawyer to do so? The Legal Assistant that emailed me a copy of the dismissal told me it wasn't that big of a deal to have it on there, but why should I have to explain that I’m not a criminal to Apartment complexes/jobs/etc for something I never did. Is there anything I can do?

**This gets long under here. I'm sorry. Maybe it's part venting my frustrations

I'm fairly certain that I'm going to be told to suck it up and tell her to get help for her benefit. I'm fully aware that I should

So...some background: The first hint that something was wrong was when she was in the ninth grade. I was pulled out of class one day by my guidance counselor and the school nurse, he'd never touched me. They said, ""Well, your sister told us he's been molesting her for years.""

When we'd visit my dad, but I do know that he is not the type of guy to be inappropriate with any child.

Inevitably, the record states that there is no evidence that anything untoward occurred, but needless to say, it destroyed their relationship, and he ended up not feeling comfortable around me, either.

Later, the psychologist would bring up supposed episodes in my sister's past that brought her to that point. Some of the highlights:

* She had attempted suicide four times since the age of 4. Apparently at 4, she swallowed pills, but threw them up. And now she was in her 20s, hospitalized for an apparent suicide attempt with pills. The only one that was possibly true was this latest attempt.

* Our late first stepfather had once beaten her so badly that she was hospitalized for a week. He was a terrible man, he was not smart enough to hit people where it wouldn't leave a mark - he did beat my brother and my mother.

* She suffered from a litany of rare illnesses. To my knowledge

(*Edit:* A few years later, she called me and informed me that I'd never believe it - both of her legs had cramped for a few hours, and boy, she was sure worried that she'd gotten Guillain-Barre, too. ""Boy, what would the chances have been of that?"")

Shocked

Fast-forward to about six months later. She's visiting for a week or so. My sister, and about that time, her friend goes to get more food (it was a buffet). My sister casually turns to me and says, ""Oh, thank God, I got my period. I was raped two weeks ago, and I was worried that I was pregnant."" She goes on to tell me, I was at the gas station

Now, she would not be able to just casually turn to me and mention that she'd been raped. I just kind of sat there and looked around - how the heck do you respond to that? Especially when you're almost certain it's a complete lie?

A few years later, she's making friends...she's actually enjoying life. She finishes her master's program and moves onto another school for her PhD. We're all proud and happy for her, since it seemed she'd found something that truly helped her get her head straight.

One year into her program, on her computer, or texting her best friend. Christmas passes, and I make a mental note to get up early the next morning so that I could tell her goodbye before she left for home. She got up before everyone else, packed up the car, and left without a word.

A few weeks later, but she wanted my advice. Since she had a key, I requested that she at least go and make sure that my sister is up and walking around. Thankfully she is, and she makes plans to come home to my mother's for awhile to get her head straight.

She spent less than a week there before she ran back home. My parents didn't know that she had supposedly threatened suicide, the one thing she claimed was stressing her out the most.

We go back to zero contact. I can't even get her on Facebook. Finally, gotten an ear infection, and lost her hearing suddenly. Two weeks later, she IMs me again to tell me not to tell our mother, but her hearing hadn't come back and she was worried that something happened to her eardrum or the bones in the ear or something. She was deaf.

I called my mother to ask if she'd heard anything along those lines. While I am explaining my suspicions

My sister had gone to her best friend, ""I can't tell them, I can't hear them, you need to tell them for me. You need to tell them I'm deaf.""

We all bought it, and sinker. My mother calls me back in tears and says, ""Well, if she's lying, she's got Tammy in on it, too, and they're good."" I immediately feel terrible, it could have been something with the bones in the ear...

...And then, ""Oh. Well, I learned how to read lips really fast.""

I started to get actually angry with her for keeping up her ""Oh, I'm deaf, why don't the doctors believe me"" routine while our stepfather's heart was failing very quickly. She went as far as claiming she got TTY service on her phone. When my mother told me that, I sighed and replied, ""I'm sorry. I miss her, but she's taking it too far. I'm not talking to my sister through a stranger.""

Doctors refused to treat her. She shopped around for psychologists until she found one that would buy her story. He diagnosed her, she's still able to live her life, and my mother catches her on multiple occasions responding when she couldn't have possibly been able to read her lips (for example, when she was in the next room).

Our stepfather was dying. The entire time, and why does everything have to be so hard for her....

He died a month ago. Her hysterical deafness claim has just kind of...gone away. No one has confronted her about it. Why? Because the last time someone confronted her, and she's family. Despite everything, she means a lot to me, and I have no idea how the hell to tell her to get help. To not go for the attention ploy - go get help for what causes her to do this. To find out why she craves drama and pity.

Her best friend has now distanced herself and her children from my sister. Why? Because her best friend has two small daughters, Best Friend was putting together a number of inconsistencies with the lies my sister had told her, and she just didn't feel it was healthy to be around their family.

I don't know enough about bipolar disorder to claim that lying can be part of it. But really, such as borderline personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder. I'm not a professional by any means, but I love her, and I know she's not getting the help that she needs.

One morning, around 6am (i.e. a time where there is really no reason for anyone to be wandering around outside someone’s home). The way my house is set up, if you stand at a certain place outside of my house, on the opposite side of where my bathroom is, and look in through one of the slits in the blinds, you can see into the bathroom.

I happened to glance out of my bathroom because someone else in my house had said something, looking at me.  I screamed, closed the bathroom door, and started to dial 911 (as we had had a noted problem with Peeping Toms), but right before I was about to call, my phone rang.  It was my neighbor, who told me that she had also seen the man looking in, the police show up at my house, but they said he was put on a record of some sort

Fast-forward to today, which says that this same man, XYZ, was jailed this past week for luring a minor girl into his home (again, four houses down from me), and then brutally raping her, landing her in the ICU.  He is now in jail on a bond, he has four brothers who still live in the house

I entered college and am still nominally an engineering student. I've worked my ass off by studying for 6-8 hours per day on top of my courses. And yet, and my parents were hospitalized for the better part of two months due to a drunk driver hitting their vehicle. Accordingly, this has created a compound anxiety whenever I'm in a testing situation in which I cannot assemble the information I obviously have practiced and possess, therefore doing poorly, and reinforcing the cycle. 

 I am not receiving any aid for college

All in all, and the gateway to doing what I wish to do, is above my intelligence level. Since I have never been particularly skilled in any area besides academics, this is an especial blow to me to be failing/borderline failing. It does not help that my parents constantly remind me of my own shortcomings in spite of my requests that they move past it, blaming my poor grades on ""extracirricular"" activities, of which there were few if any. 

Currently, the others are far more capable intellectually and the curve is probably going to be extremely high; ergo, even with a 70 or 80%, I will still probably only get a C at best unless I can somehow surpass the average.

I am sorry for dumping this on you. I just feel hopeless, and am seriously considering ending my life; if I can't do engineering, there is no other point in continuing my life and becoming a drain on everyone around me. If you have any advice, or anything you can do to console me, I would very much value it. ",,False,t5_2r367,True

I haven't found a job yet, I decided to go visit a few friends out in New York City. And here a few days has made me realize how unhappy I am. Let me explain.

One of my friends has a very bubbly personality. He's always smiling, and a group of girls had hula hoops. He approached them and started talking, and within minutes he was hula hooping with them and they were taking pictures with him and everyone had a great time. That night, we went to get a beer at a local bar. There were two very cute waitresses, and somehow he got both of them to take a break and come talk with us, and before you knew it, they agreed to stop by the coffee shop he worked at the next day.

So basically, how the restaurant was treating them (it just opened), all in a fun and joking way. When I try to make small talk with people, I'm so worried that I won't have something to talk about that I come off as boring and stale and the conversation quickly ends (usually to my relief).

So, I rarely have the energy to go out and ""practice"". Right now my friend is at work and I'm at his apartment. The idea of going out, on my own, and trying to replicate what my friend can do, is totally overwhelming and unappealing. But I know my friend would be bouncing off the walls if he were forced to stay by himself for a few hours. I *want* to be like that, but I feel like our personalities are so different that it would be almost impossible.",,,,

Sorry for the wall of text and I'm not even sure if I'm looking for advice or anything

My father hasn't worked since 2008 and my mom and more recently, he's been experiencing depression and my aunt from dad's side (oldest of 10+ kids) has been helping him with his condition. She's a trained psychologist and to help out with our family's finances, he's been applying for disability. His depression wasn't severe before 2012, so at the time, maybe 2010 on, we didn't have a legitimate case. My father was denied twice, and because of that, my aunt suggested he move his case to another state.  To my understanding

Because my aunt has a strong influence on my dad, she wouldn't let him in and called the cops.

With this treatment **every single day**: he started losing weight, his mood was getting better and he started becoming more healthy again.

He flew back to that state earlier this year for a month or two because his court date was scheduled, go to his friend's house all day just to avoid my aunt's horrible treatment. Unfortunately, the court date was postponed last minute and then he came back home. He was changed.

He got a new court date recently and prior to going

He endured **ALL OF THAT** so he could help my family with our finances. And then the dagger: He was excited that he could finally help with our mortgage and my aunt was **livid** that he would want to do that. And that **SHE** would handle his finances. Which I clearly don't understand why she's so against it. Why exactly did he have to endure all those years of wondering if he'll get approved for disability insurance if not to contribute to our family's well-being? The money is **worthless** without the goal. Might as well burn it if he isn't ""allowed"" to help us. Was it only her intention to help *HIM* and not me

Over the past few years

Because of all that stress

There are a billion more details but I can't think of them at the moment. If you've read this far

EDIT: More on my aunt which may explain her personality better. She and her husband divorced maybe 10-15 years ago. She and her daughter have an estranged relationship. She lives in the other state for whatever reason

I'm blaming her for the damage she did to my father's health, she's exacerbated his condition. 

His situation currently is not fraudulent as he was living in the state when his application was processed and his mental state at the time was extremely dire. He has not (since the beginning of 2012) been capable of working as he has extreme insomnia and fluctuating depression. Since he was approved

He got released from the hospital today and we're taking the steps necessary to move on from this. We are in the process of pushing her out of the account and have already shut off contact with her.

Really she's just extremely resistant to change

She smokes, and doesn't get enough sleep.   She's at risk for tons of health issues.   The stress from her job is literally killing her.   

I have no idea what to do or how to convince her she needs to start liking herself enough to take better care of herself, going to the physician once drove her to get drunk… not sure how I could convince her to talk about her feelings with a professional.

My sister hasn't spoken to my mom or myself in over 2 months. I'm very upset and worried for her (she was molested as a child by a fellow church member -- we're all atheists now except my mom) because of her past. I've always been her big brother. I've always been there for her and so has my mom. 

* What I think:

My sister seems to be upset because I was laid off work and am currently relying on unemployment to make ends meet and that my mom MIGHT lose her job because her union doesn't seem to want to represent the workers that are being mistreated (my mom stands up for herself and her co-workers as opposed to many others). I'm currently working a side business that is beginning to generate enough revenue to make my full-time job in the near future and the possibility that my mom will get fired is relatively low. 

These tiny bumps in the road, but simply not communicating with your family (my sister didn't even bother to call my mom on Mother's day) is not the way to go. Reddit, how can I fix this!! I'm a guy. Tell me what to do and I'll do it! Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post.

Alright, and he's 18. We're both in high school. To put things lightly, his mom is fairly messed up. His dad was really abusive before he left them ten years ago. Her parents were also abusive to her as a child. As a result, she's really paranoid, depressed, and generally has mental breakdowns really frequently.

She takes all of her anger and sadness out on my boyfriend, takes advanced classes, and gets good grades. He even cleans the house for her and cooks her food. He's really nice to her, too. Despite this, she screams at him, and says horrible things. He comes over to my house really depressed every time this happens.
She's threatened to leave and leave him homeless because she ""couldn't care less"" About him

The other day, who told him to get a doctor appointment right away. His mom, instead of consoling him, screamed about how he was a waste of money, and about how much the medical tests will cost. Then, after the doctors told him to go to the ER next time it happens, she said that she ""wasn't taking him to any fucking ER""

She also constantly berates him for being agnostic, I'm talking the WRONG COLORED JEANS or WRONG HAIR LENGTH) she screams at him and says he looks like trash. He's trying to get a job, but she won't let him drive, and also cleaning the house/ cooking for her takes up all of his fucking time after school.

He's so nice to his mom, and I feel horrible that this is happening. I have no idea what to do to help him. He can def. stay at my house if she leaves, but that's not a permanent solution. He still has another year of high school, no money, and no family financial support. However, things can't go on like this. Thinking that a mother screams at her child and tells him to ""fuck himself"" After he asks for a doctor's appointment is basically incomprehensible to me. His dad beat him all of his child hood, and his bitch of a mother takes it upon herself to continue the abuse

This morning, and told him he has to leave. Once again, I quote: ""Get the fuck out, I don't want to see your fucking face again."" I know he's 18, but there's no way a mother can just abandon her high school kid like that and expect him to get a job overnight or something. She really needs some professional help.

Once again, and he takes care of her all of the time he's not at school. Wtf. Seriously.

Is there anything I can do to get her help? Should I call the police or something? This is horrible and I can't stand this happening any longer.

1369784465.0,1f8eoq,My sister verbally abuses my mom and doesn't listen to my dad. My dad wanted me to talk to her and now I'm going to court.,Neckrow,19,6,25,"To start off

My mom makes all the money in the house and pays all the bills. My dad helps with some purchases of food

If my dad tries to lecture Michelle but she would just say he has no right to tell her anything to do because he doesn't pay any bills in the house and she won't listen to him. She calls out my dad on not having a good education and a bad job and says hes basically useless in the house.

My mom works graveyard shift and usually comes home to yelling from my father. When my sister yells at my mom she lets it happen. She sometimes cries and she feels like everyone is being mean to her. She doesn't punish, if Michelle yelled at my mom and then asked my mom for money then she would probably give my sister money. Btw, I go out of my way to be very respectful to my mom now but I feel she doesn't appreciate it and I'm fine with that as long as I'm not adding negativity to her life. So I'm not implying I'm being mean to her as well. 

This is a conflict between my mom and my sister and I'm not sure if my dad was present at the moment. My sister is always making my mom feel bad for things around the house.

For example; My mom put granola cereal in a jar that my sister puts oatmeal in. My sister yelled at my mom for this and I woke up to it in the morning and then called my mom a piece of shit. 

I've tried to talk to her in the past but she will say it's none of my business or that I have no right to say anything because I started community college over after being 2 years in because I wanted to do Engineering and not Nutrition Science. And she keeps a 4.0 gpa and wants to go to a good school.

I remember once I was in the kitchen and my mom was trying to cook a ham. She asked my sister ""do I have to add water to this ham?"" and my sister was saying ""No

So

She said it was none of my business and I have no right to say anything. I started yelling and saying she causes mom too much stress. She is VERY passive aggressive and she starts smiling and chuckling. So I pushed her and she fell on her backpack. She ended up going into her room which we were in front of and I stood in front of the door. She said get out of the room and how she didn't want to hear it but I said no

A few months ago I told my friend about how my sister abuses my mom and acts like she owns the house with trying to control my mom and he told me that I needed to sit down and talk to her but I know she won't listen to me from past experience because she will bring up how I used to be very angry and take out my anger on my other sister Danielle or how I'm going to community college. (which was by choice because I'm very undecided) Even those arguments I feel are very superficial. It was past events that happened over 2 years ago and I didn't physically abuse someone until I pushed my sister Michelle today.

**About me:** I am self-motivated and smart. I had straight A’s all throughout high school, I have always been responsible, and have never needed my parents to do anything for me except give me rides and sign school papers. I got a part job last summer and have ever since funded my own purchases, although they are still paying for my $55,000 university (no financial aid, we make ~150k) because where am I supposed to get that kind of money. I currently work 22hrs/week on top of school and am looking for a second job. I will be moving across the country to attend said university starting in August. 

**Why I’m posting today:** I got into a fight with my dad last night. He wouldn’t let me go out with my friends after work (10pm). I asked him why, he doesn’t know anything about me, and what the fuck difference would it make? I told him he’s being a jerk because I’ve never caused trouble, I always come home safely, I am extremely responsible and I never bother anyone in the family. Really, the only time any problem arises with my father is when I try to go out. He always texts me at midnight and says “Go home.” I text him “yeah” or “k” and sometimes I go home or sometimes I just take my time coming home until he texts me something like “You are home in 5 minutes” or “Home! Now!” Just because I think he’s being a fucking dick for making me go home (I spend my entire day studying or working). I eventually come home, he SAYS NOTHING to me, I just walk to my room and sit in silence while my friends are out without me having fun. Last night

**THE ISSUE AT HAND:** As a result of my upbringing (and perhaps a couple other early childhood things)

When I was 13, obvious scars...there's tens of them. I can't remember if I had any fresh cuts that day. He asked ""what happened?"" I said ""nothing."" He said ""did the cat scratch you?"" I said ""yeah."" The conversation was dropped. Nothing was ever said again about those scars. There is no way my cat could have scratched me that many times, in that many directions, with such varying severity of each cut. I don't know if my father is dense or what, but that was that.

Then, all while having horrible self esteem issues, no friends at school, and struggling with keeping my relationship with my boyfriend who moved across the country. I lost all of my friends and my boyfriend broke up with me because he could not handle my volatility and self destructive thoughts/actions. I began self-harming again after a few-year hiatus. This time I would cut my arm, whip myself with a heavy studded belt, smoke cigarettes, purposely take higher doses of whatever medicine I was taking, starting (and ending) at school. The school counselor decided that I needed to see an actual mental health professional, quit many of my activities, my motivation. 

Later that year, that I’m lazy and need to stop slacking off, he said just go the fuck to school. I texted him (I can’t talk to him in real life.) about my troubles. The text read, “Do you think I WANT to be up late? Do you think I WANT to never sleep? I don’t get why it’s not plainly obvious that I’m having so much trouble with school and the amount of homework I have. A school counselor called mother to tell her that I’m having a hard time concentrating and neither of you did a thing for me! So I have no damn choice but to continue doing my homework all night and continue suffering because you never take me seriously!” I couldn’t tell him anything else about my anxiety, or anything. I figured this text would be enough for him – it was the first time in my entire life that I have tried to cry for help. First time I’ve even spoken to him. 
 
Now my father is the kind of person who thinks he always knows the answer. If I have a problem, and my sleeping schedule is backwards, and that is why I cannot concentrate. End of story. I don’t know what I was expecting, I just thought maybe a loving parent would tell me a little more like they’re upset that I’m having such a hard time and offer me some help.  


That is it – that’s where I am today. I am still struggling. I wish I could make enough to move away from home but I can’t, and I don’t know how to get help. On the bright side, I am 18 now. I don’t know. What do I do about my situation? My parents will never listen to me. I want to fix myself, which may require my parents to drive me to a psychologist, and pay for the appointments, but how am I even supposed to get to the point that I'm seeing a psychologist if my parents won't listen? I've considered many times just overdosing, just doing some severe harm that will REQUIRE medical attention
I don't even want to have a good relationship with them

Maybe that was just me looking for a more exciting life, and if I just settle down and become content with not going to school (because thinking sets me off) and not having any friends (I've been withdrawn from all my friends for several months now) I wouldn't even need mental health counseling.

",Difficult_Decision,16,20, and I have reason to believe she has been taking money from my bank account. My mom will make me feel bad and be angry with my for wanting to move in with him


**Full story and background:** 

My parents divorced 8 or 9 years ago, so I usually go over to his house every other weekend, for a month during summer, and some school breaks. I'm currently a junior in high school, but am in a state program that allows me to take college courses instead, so I only go to school a couple days a week, and moving wouldn't affect that. 

I have various reasons for wanting to move in with my dad. My room at my mom's is in the basement, but it's present), and I have reason to believe my mom has been taking money from my savings account, roughly $150. Not a ton of money, but I know for a fact that she is at least lying about the balance in the account. She claims there's a certain amount, but I went into the bank and was told differently, and I did not take the money out. She believes that I can't access this information
 
Additionally, or something like that, my mom makes a huge deal about the cost of items, yet spends just as much money on things like coffee, getting her car repaired, etc. and doesn't say anything about the cost. I'm not trying to sound entitled to all of these things, as I understand things are expensive, who is the sole provider at my mom's house

I have a job at a store, and to be honest, I'll probably feel kind of bad. I'm not sure why. It might be because I've lived with my mom for so long. I think my mom will think I'm moving in with him because he will allow me to get a motorcycle while she won't, but that's not the reason, at all. I honestly think I might be happier living at my dad's house. 

Any advice? Thank you very much in advance.

I’m 18

I did go on to university in the fall… I went to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science. I did horrible in my first term. I failed Honours Calculus, but I didn’t have to take the advanced CS. 

This was a punch in my self-esteem. I had graduated high school at the top of my class (95% avg) and math was one of my strengths. Moreover

Since I did so horribly and now had to repeat three courses for my next term

So my plan was to return to UW for CS after fixing and improving myself. Enter my toxic and controlling parents. They don’t want me to back to doing CS

They want me to go into nursing. Ryerson nursing. They want me to live at home and be a commuter. I might as well just kill myself now. I don’t want to be a nurse. I don’t think I’d be good a being a nurse. Although I am empathetic and compassionate, I’m guaranteed a job.
Also… I don’t want to live another 4-5 years with my family. I hate them. I am the scapegoat and the outcast. I need to get away from them. But I don’t have the resources. I don’t have money. And I am ill. But who gives a damn if I’m ill

I took the time off to study and attempt to cure my mental issues

“Get a job!” you say. But there are problems with that too.  First of all, mentally and physically, every fucking day. But who cares because my pain is invisible, right? It’s not like you’d yell at a cancer patient that they’re lazy for not getting a job.

I only have five more months till fall term begins again.

I don’t know what to do.

I should also mention that my parents threatened to cut off all support if I choose to go back to UW for CS. They’ve given me an ultimatum

I am already $6k in debt cause of my first term… I need to somehow pay OSAP back soon.

I only have one close friend who is also my boyfriend.

I want to die.

He speaks in internet memes and swears using words like ""goram"" from Firefly.  He literally says ""squeeee"" when excited and ""iiinnnerestings"" when something is interesting.

He's across the table from me right now, and as I sit here, he just did one of his long sighs.  He's always sighing about something.  Loudly.  He also says very often ""this will be fun"" or ""tonight/this weekend will be fun"" in an extremely sarcastic voice.  It's like he's in a constant state of dreading everything he's planning on doing.  He breathes with his mouth open, has a blank look in his eyes all the time...  He is quite possibly the least self-aware person I have ever met in my entire life.  He makes every social interaction awkward.  To make things worse, he has a girlfriend now (she's not exactly a catch) and he will use any opportunity to talk about plans with her or his weekend with her, loudly emphasizing the word ""girlfriend"" and never calling her by name.

Last Monday, and she started to 'learn' how she was a reincarnation of John Lennon, and Jesus, and a number of other historical figures.

She came up with all sorts of plans to create a band that would change the world, and she went out to buy a harmonica and panpipe, despite not knowing how to play either.

Earlier this afternoon, so she took her friend and the two of them packed up much of her stuff and moved out. I wasn't expecting that at all, and I have no fucking idea what this means or what I should do now. She left just an hour ago, and it's past 9 and I'm alone in my house and I don't know who to call or what to do.

Can I force her to see a doctor any other way? She doesn't have insurance that covers this sort of thing, and I don't know what I can do for someone who refuses to acknowledge that they have a problem.

Fast forward to today and the client calls me and essentially tells me that everything is o.k. with the product, and my company will be on the hook for the cost of re-ordering the product (roughly $1500, which I know isn't a huge amount, but it's a fair bit for a small company). 

Unfortunately I made a similar, he essentially just left me with a ""Well, ohimsofucked, just don't let it happen again.""

And well now this has happened.

I am, and rarely with my boss. In theory, if I had to I could re-order the product on my own, and pay the replacement cost out of pocket, which would hurt me, but less so than, you know

This last semester was extremely tough for me. I never told anyone else this, and act like nothing was wrong, just so I wouldn't get asked about it - it was always the robotic, ""Yeah, not too bad; you?"" response to the standard greeting. To all my friends, I was always super happy and always joking around as usual, but when I was by myself or with my family, and it would work for a little while


This affected my academic life greatly. I had no motivation to study and all I could think about was being somewhere else where no one could contact me and I could be peaceful for just a day or two. I contemplated breaking my phone just so I would have an excuse for not being contactable, back to the academics. I sat through the first few lectures for all my subjects all ready to learn and do well this semester, as we all do. Then came more crappy thoughts. What am I doing here? This is university, and I'm supposed to be liking these subjects. Hell, I even transferred to a different degree because I felt it would be more interesting. A few weeks into semester, and I was only attending the classes where my name was marked off for attendance (and it contributed to my grade). When I came home after uni, I would go to my room and just sit there on my laptop, until I realised it would just be a break


""Dude, but my response would always be, ""Man, I'm doing an engineering degree!"" We would laugh it off, but deep in my thoughts I was thinking about how I didn't want to introduce another person into this mundane life I seem to lead - it would only make me use up more time I didn't have. I would look at all the people wearing suits or work attire on the bus and train to and from uni. I thought to myself, ""You had to do a fair bit of work to get to where you are now, but was it worth it? You had sleepless nights, but the look on your face dreads that you are going home for a few hours, all for what? Just so I can finish uni and get a job and be like the sardines on the train home? I'll do this for another 40-50 years, and you'll enjoy the rest of your life


As a result of what seemed like depression, I gained 19kg (around 40lbs). The more weight I gained, the less I cared about things. Assignment due soon? Screw it, I'll do it the night before it's due. Test worth 5%? Meh, it's only 5%. I wasn't doing well with my assessments, but occasionally I'd do well - that would be the easy stuff. Then finals came around. I knew I would do bad in them, but then again, but I would always respond, and I'm pretty sure I failed three of them.

Brief backstory points:

* My parents met and married in 1967
* My father frequently cheated on my mother
* In order to get a divorce
* My father would drop into our lives from time to time over the years an expect to be honored as the returning king.  He would terrorize my mother and get furious with anyone that didn't do exactly as he said
* Despite all of this, screaming at her, throwing things, acting like a spoiled child. On my very first day at his house after not seeing him for 8 years, he ripped into his new wife enough to make her cry and take off in her car.  He laughed as she drove off, calling her a ""dumb cunt""
* It took only a couple of days working for my father for him to fly off the handle with me
* When I had finally had enough, stunned that he belted me.
* I left the next day and he sent me a letter
* I am the oldest of all his children and have more experiences and was able to understand many of his actions when my siblings were too young to know what was going on. Some of them have a closer relationship to him than I do.

These are only a tiny selection of things off the top of my head.  Believe me, but she didn't as she comes from a family that doesn't believe in divorce. Nothing can be done about that now.

I found out from a sibling that my father was admitted to his local hospital (across the country from me) and he was given a diagnosis of stage 4 colon cancer. He's not expected to survive very long.

That, which I did not do. Or any home AP courses. Essentially, I have a blank academic record. This, of course, does not indicate any lack of intellectualism, as I have been keeping myself on a autodidactic rigor for quite a while, despite my dyscalculia

The dyscalculia is my second ""mistake"". Obviously I did not have a choice in it, and algebra is downright impossible. That's the reason why my SAT math score is 340, even after studying. I just cannot do it.

Unfortunately, even when I make it a subject in an admissions essay, segueing into point three...

This spring, it was for that reason (among some others) that it had a ~30% admit rate. I heard from friends that much more qualified applicants that I also failed. It's a small consolation.

Now here's where the real issues being. I'm going into the fall 2011 semester with nothing lined up. I'm considering a photographic expedition to, which I can only assume is essay gold.

In 2008 I joined the military and was stationed in California where I now live. I quickly made a few very close friends here, it was a pretty big mistake that I regret, but I refuse to dwell on it. I'm trying to get back on my feet now that I'm a civilian.

The last year has been the hardest in my life. My friends and I have all lost our careers, I was only in for 2 weeks). I had to perform military hard labor for 3 months straight, 7 days a week/12 hours a day. Now, after much hardship and grief we are all civilians. We've decided to try and make it out here on our own, but we have no benefits left over from the military, no GI bill, nothing. We all have general discharges under honorable conditions (so thankfully our reputations aren't totally destroyed). We've been searching for jobs, but I can't even get a job at a gas station! I've been living off the last check from the military, a storage unit that we used to move but which now is overdue. I'm broke

That's not even the whole story. That's the very central core. My brother also just lost his job and spent a few days in jail for some low stuff. He's hopeless and looking to me for advice and optimism but I don't even have any.

1281339583.0,cyzlh,How do I help my sister?,SmoSays,15,0,6,"This is a bit of a read but here goes. 

My sister is sixteen years old with stunted maturity, our parents. 

My sister, I see why. She's afraid to speak her mind about anything and only talks to be overly critical of others' actions or appearance. She's not cruel about it, almost as if she's making conversation. She laughs if she thinks they're supposed to be funny (apparently, she's decided pretty much everything falls under this category) and it is a horrifyingly fake laugh. 

Anna is sixteen years old. My parents refuse to teach her to drive ('she's not ready' and 'she can't handle it' are the most common excuses despite the fact there's no way of knowing this since she's never been behind the wheel) and refuse to drive her anywhere. She's not allowed to walk even a block away (they live in a pretty decent neighborhood so there's no justification) and they claim she couldn't handle a job. 

Both of my parents are overly critical of their kids, those little gestures people do when they're not paying attention to themselves (like drumming your fingers or plucking at a stray thread) but completely ignore the important. If she gets bad grades, they blame her ADD medication (she's been on it since she was thirteen, which I'm sure isn't helping) or the ADD itself. If she gets good grades, they brag about their good parenting. They yell at her for doing little things such as asking somebody what they're reading (even if she's asking me) or putting hot sauce on her food. They aren't against these things; they just decide she shouldn't do them. At times, they are even insulting. There was one moment my father pointed to a kid actor on TV and told Anna 'see that boy? He's half your age and works hard at his job. He's much smarter than you could hope to be.'  

Anna is smart. In the rare moments I've caught her off her guard she displays an astonishing amount of intelligence. She's got a dry sense of humor and is a gifted sculptor. 

As for me . . . like I said I experience these *issues* as well as depression and insomnia and in the past, which is due to numerous variables. 

When my parents started out, nagging, and argumentative. 

I also had a good deal of cousins near my age and they would go to bat for me if need be. Anna, and this is going to sound kind of sad, but got very heavily into online communities which helped with my social skills. That, and I've held a job pretty solidly since I was fifteen. Anna almost seems like she has stockholm syndrome. Somethings wrong, clearly but because that life is all she knows, she'll do anything to keep her life as stress-free as possible. To do that, she convinces herself she agrees with whatever my parents say even if she told me in confidence she feels opposite. My parents don't argue with logic. They pull lies out of their ass and try to argue you down to wear your'e just worn out and go along. I, never did this. I fought tooth and nail. Anna does not have the internet

I left as soon as I turned eighteen and talk to them maybe twice a month at most. I've tried to talk to my sister but as you can tell

If I lived in a house I'd let her move in with me. If I had money I'd get her driver's ed classes. If I could drive (they refused to teach me and I just learned the bus system very well) I'd teach her to do the same. 

I just . . . I don't know what to do.

Background: My parents divorced when I was about 2 and I lived with my Mom and Step-Dad (both drug addicts) and my step-sister. Eventually they had 2 kids together (totaling 3 girls, not very educated). My Dad had me on weekends and two nights a week for dance. I never had anyone at my Mom's house watching me.
My Mom and Step-Dad were so lost in drugs. Both my Mom and Step-Dad physically abused me and my step-sister and other brother and sister when they got older. My Dad was constantly calling Child Protective Services because of new bruises on my face, legs, and butt. He realized he needed to do something more drastic and wanted to get full custody of me.

Story I need advice with:
My step-sister and I made friends with a girl next door (call her A) who was about 4-5 years older than us (we were in kindergarten/1st grade and she was in 5th grade). My step-sister and I always wanted A to think we were cool so we would do whatever she wanted to do. We were all just playing barbies one day and she started to rub the ken and barbie doll together. She told us they were having sex and that her and her friends like to get naked and rub their bodies together. 
She told us that they would build forts and hang blankets from the ceiling so their parents wouldn't know because they weren't supposed to rub bodies but they liked it. She asked us if we wanted to try it. I'm not sure if curiosity was the reason that we did or if we were seduced because we were so young but I find the whole situation very creepy now. We called them ""sex games"" and every time we had sleep overs she wanted to play ""sex games"" with us. Sometimes she would lay between us switch back and forth pretending she was cheating on one or the other. The ""sex games"" eventually led me to start touching myself. I noticed if when I had to pee and I rubbed myself

One day I was ""making myself not want to pee"" laying on the couch in the living room. I was trying to hide from my Mom's friend that I was doing this but she noticed. I tried to pretend I was tickling myself on the inside of my leg like my Dad did to me. She asked me who touches me there and I said my Dad. Not because he touched me *there* but that he tickles me on my leg. She thought I meant my Dad was molesting me. I can still see the pain in her eyes and feel that I said something wrong today. I watch it replay in my mind almost every day. Watching her get up off the couch and run to the other room to tell my Mom what I just said. 

The next few months were very hard. My Dad lost custody of me and wasn't allowed to see me for over a year. They gave me a ""vaginal check"" of sorts and proved that I was being touched. I was too scared to tell them it stemmed from my neighbor teaching us ""sex games"" and then from me touching myself. He hired a lawyer and was found innocent eventually. My Mom was found to be ""unfit"" and my Dad was granted full custody of me. I've lived with my Dad ever since (my step-sister lived with her grandmother and my brother and sister stayed with my Mom

My problem is i'm stuck in a rut tbh as I can't get a job as any social interaction isn't possible or at least is something I'd want to avoid at all costs and even so I'd never get a job being an almost 30 years old with no education and an empty CV and even if I did i'm literally an employers worst nightmare and wouldn't be able to keep a job with my social skills/problems

I'd REALLY like a job even something really menial would be fine as it'd bring in some much needed cash (Always LOVED the idea of working from home that'd be a dream!)

Where to start with my shit fuck of a ~~life~~ *existence* like mine? :'(

My mom married my step dad when I was in 9th grade so we moved in with him to this small town in Texas.
Through out my high school he put many rules on me.
He began by not letting me go to a different church on wednesdays other than the ""family"" church (where I knew no one, only letting me use my cell phone 4 hours a day from the end of school to 7.
Somehow I got rid of these rules by the end of 9th grade
Sophomore year he began ""evaluating"" my progress. He bought a white board, be involved in family activities (him and my mom), pet the dogs, read quality books, etc. He graded me on these for quite a while. I ignored it.
Junior year I asked to go to NY with my theater arts class. I knew it was a big question, this seemed like an okay idea for such a big petition, but this only started what would come my senior year..
The summer before senior year I did all I could to begin driving, which I had and still have to pay, etc. The car though, was not given to me because of a condition. 1. I would have to read books CONSTANTLY in order to be able to ""pay"" them for the used car they already had for me, and if I didn't they would take it up. (These books were of their choice, including business topics, and religious ones, would have to have an average of 8 in order for me to do anything fun with the car like going out with friends etc. If I failed
I followed those rules all through senior year

I just realized how much more I still have to mention about him for anyone to know the whole thing so Ill stop here.

Right now, and work somewhere close and have support (and money) of my aunt (her mom) and my biological dad, who lives in Mexico, but sends me money.
Obviously, work at the cafe they own (I mentioned I liked in a small texas town? the customers are very rude, old, typical cowboy texans. The employees hate me and I hate them).. 
They say I don't have a choice

Did I mention all of my other family like aunts and uncles are in a huge fight with my immediate family over issues with my stepdad being so close minded? And that him and his own family are also in a fight of that kind?

But, utilities and commute (we drive an old car too) we can exactly save a whole lot.

The problem is, I'm just saying it's kinda harder to pull all this weight without any significant financial backup/background.

That being said I'm kinda lost on what I want to do with my life. So here is my state of mind:

I think my main problem is not being appreciative of my skills. I have a solid knowledge in IT and I'm currently working in marketing

The problem is whenever I finish a project

I've met a lot of people who had ""mediocre"" skills but they marketed the hell out of them

I don't know if I try to hide my procrastination habit or some subliminal self-esteem issue

The problem occurred to me last month. I've helped my good friends patent project for 2 months, and web.

I haven't yet received the money for the project yet

All I think about is how average I am and I'm aware that many people in the world could do the exact same thing I do

This affects my career choice. I wish I could do videography for life. But lately I can't even force myself to film anything

A friend of mine jokingly asked me one day ""how many shots did you take on that camera of yours...and how many of those photos are on someones wall""

It really struck me...because he has a point...yet I do not want to do mundane things like wedding photography

My main worry is how to change my mindset...how to make a bold move...how to appreciate my own self. I know I'm not the best. But I do want to be as best as I can. I just have hard time willing myself into this

The household goes through a cycle where dad hides his addictions and lies and everything is a-ok until he is found out. Then the arguing phase starts. The tension in the house escalates until my parents are arguing with each other almost every day. Then eventually my dad hits what appears to be a ""rock bottom"".  Afterwards he seems to seek help and promises that it will never happen again and he has changed for good. These promises have always turned out untrue

In the phase of ""peace"" after a rock bottom event my mom and brother immediately forgive him

Not wanting to cause anymore trouble I  usually do my best to follow their lead, and confided to her that I didn't know how much more I could stand of my dad. I wished she would just leave him, but she depends on his finances too much, and she says that she doesn't want to be alone. She told me that I shouldn't hold a grudge towards my dad and not to act bitter towards him because he has flaws just like everyone else and inside he is a good man. She has told me basically this same speech after every rock bottom moment also.

When does he stop deserving more chances? I am 19 and this cycle has been going on my whole life and it always ends in violence. I feel like I've run out of forgiveness for my dad, so I have to stay at my parents' home sometimes, and I just don't know what to do. I can't stand to be around him. It makes me so tense and angry knowing what he has done, but I work in the same building my dad does, so I partly rely on him for transportation. I honestly wish he would disappear from my life, and I feel bad for feeling this way because no one else does. Is there something wrong with me?

Basically my questions are: Am I wrong for feeling the way I do? Any advice for dealing with the way I feel about my dad? Does he deserve more chances? Should I do my best to just cut ties with him? I don't know what to do.

1365776964.0,1c7gz9,27 yo computer scientist hating his career - Lost,UnknownToThee,18,5,6,"I have had a few jobs since graduating in 2011 with a CS degree and haven't ever been able to find any happiness in my career choice.  It might be premature because I am so young

My last job gave me $55k starting out, or work that I had no idea how to do since I was new and everyone else was too busy to try and work with me on it.  It was 90% of the work was with 10% of the people because, you guessed it, horrible management.  I now work with a couple of old friends who I have known for over a decade and, when described, sounds like the best job a programmer could ever get.

I basically get no emails or phone calls.  There are 3 of us down here, along with a few other clients.  I come in and basically am given work as the day goes by.  Sometimes I get something that takes a while to complete, sometimes there are 4 or 5 tasks that take about 5 mins each to complete.  A lot of times I sit around pondering why I hate what I do or waste time on this website and others.  The thing that made this all come down yesterday was that he asked me to get a new project started using MVC and set it up with twitter bootstrap.  I have tried to learn MVC in the past but didn't really have much success and sort of took a hit to my pride.  Well, trying again just to play around with it, I realized that I still had no idea what I was looking at or what I needed to do to get going, and I just felt no motivation to even try to learn it (probably because I have been depressed the past 2 weeks).

I thought just a couple of weeks ago this all was stemming from my girlfriend's job because she works odd hours and I don't see her very much

I get into these cycles of hating my job, but I don't have a clue what I would change to.  I feel that if I didn't do programming, got a job somewhere else, I would make a lot less money and not be able to afford it.  I feel like if I went back to school, I definitely wouldn't be able to afford it and, anyways, I don't even want to go back to school right now.  I have too much debt from the first go around and what if I paid for another degree that I wouldn't like any more than what I have.  I feel like I want to move, I don't sleep real well

So I am asking for some guidance since I don't know where else to turn really.  However, and honestly am not sure if any of those things that I said I feel like I need are the answers.  But something has to give and I don't know what that is.  

I have heard that maybe reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/0316167266) is a good starting point.  I might go get it today.

I am sure I am not the only one that has these issues ( I have been scouring the CS subs and this sub and see it as well).  Am I just burnt out?  How could that be if I only have been doing this legitimately for just over a year?

I've been using this website for a little over a year, the self righteousness, the repetition of it all, everything. 

Yet I swear I spend 80% of my waking hours on this website. I'm a student yet I barely go to class, don't even leave my dorm except to get food. But I don't know why I choose to live like this. I'll go to class for the first ~third of a semester and ace every test and assignment, then think fuck it I can do this in my sleep and stop going to class. Then I'll miss a test or not turn in a project or something because I didn't do something as simple as caring enough to write down a goddamn due date. Then I just give up because I know I'm *fucked* regardless of what I do because I just ruined my chances of getting good grades. I *had* friends but don't have the wherewithall to keep up friendships for more than a few weeks with anyone who I don't see as being a pretty perfect example of a human being.

I pity myself and but at the same time think I'm better than everyone and that I could own the fucking world if I just tried. (just like everyone says on Reddit. but it's different for *me*! /s) I know, and I'm attractive to boot.

 My only friend is my girlfriend (1 year younger, 'man I never see you around anymore, you must be a busy guy!' they probably think I'm just aloof and not riddled with self hatred and anxiety sitting in my room]. It's like I don't think I'm actually a member of the human species and being normal just isn't an option for me. I just don't see the point of it all. 

I think I'm depressed or even bi-polar but who really knows I might just be a moody loser. (this post is very negative and self-hating because that's how I feel right now, but I'm not even sure that I believe it's a real thing. I realize that I'm a posterboy for ADD and that it explains a lot of my issues, but most of the time I think it's a bullshit ""disorder"" and more of an excuse for why I'm just being a piece of shit who needs amphetamines to get anything done.

The problem is I have been extremely stressed out about writing essays even though I got good/okay grades last term. I have 2 due next week and I can’t even figure out where to start.

*Basically I don’t like ANY of my classes. I only had 7 classes to choose from and I had to pick 4. I was forced into doing shit I have no interest in. I have absolutely NO INTEREST in ANY of the stuff I’m reading.*

I don’t understand why that is. I’m an English major

*The thing is

I hate school right now. That’s not good because I was on the Dean’s list my freshmen year. I shouldn’t hate school

I think the problem is I can’t think abstractly and I’m not good at bullshitting. Which is what you NEED if you’re majoring in English.

The thing is, which I've done for 13 years. And no, I’m not going to go to cosmetology school.

My whole life I thought I would be going to grad school. My dad and grandpa always tell me after I’m done with this degree, the drive—and that I’m not sure I even want to.*

I can get my teaching license but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life teaching snotty bratty kids. All the hate for arts degrees on reddit is getting to me.  Everyone thinks if you’re not a STEM major your degree is worthless.  I’m sick of hearing that. And I’m not going to major in science, teach.” It makes me feel worthless.

Not passionate about anything else other than music and makeup which won't get me anywhere.**

* Where can I find my love for reading for pleasure and writing creatively again?

I recently had to list my work history and living history for the past five years, but as for the dates I was utterly lost, even for jobs earlier this year.

A lot of it seems to be tied to poor spatial awareness.  I am the KING of getting lost, I'll spend twenty minutes making u-turns and missed exits until I get lucky and find my path again.

But really why I'm writing this is because of a specific and very consistent sort of mistake that I make at work.  It's something that becomes much worse under stress, so I often have 15 things going on at once for prep work, but it's always that last part of a series that I just blank on. 

Examples:  

* When making the fire for the pizza oven, but it still happens.  

* When making sauces, mounting with butter, seasoning....all the time.  

* I forget garnishes all the time.  I'll have the chef freaking out at me after the fourth consecutive time

* When making doughs, I will forget and burn the dough.  If I throw a dough in, walk to my station, and someone says ""Hey"" to me, it's like it instantly resets my mental cache and I'll forget about the dough.  Every. Time.

I got a full scholarship from an oil company from home to study in UT. In my first semester, ""What would happen if I just shoot you now?"" He was hallucinating those days and thought his was seeing his dead aunt. I bought him diapers because the drugs fucked his bowels. I carried his naked body from the bathroom floor a few times when he tried to clean his feet using the sink. Muslims clean their feet with sinks, or shower, before praying. I recall that my little brother of age eight running upstairs and telling me to help dad because he fell in the bathroom. Cancer is nasty--we all know that.

So dad died and I went back to UT. I smoked a lot of pot--it numbed me. Some people I had met in the dorms became friends because, so I had relied on strangers. They are good friends now.

I did well in the spring and became a pothead. In my first summer in UT, but oh well, druggies. Drugs work for a while then they rape you.

My second year was fine too. I did more ecstasy and more shrooms and started drinking alone. Things were okay as long as I had a capsule with white powder that brought vivid memories of dad. I talked to those capsules alone. They were good friends. I stopped smoking and drinking because molly

I had kept doing that shit, and opes. It had become normal to get wasted and blame dad's dying to why I was snorting those lines and sticking syringes in my butt.

Then it got dark. Suicidal ideations woke me up and threw me to sleep. Whiskey was my food. My identity crises was peeking too: how do you deal with living in Saudi after college when you know you are an atheist. A girl I had loved dumped me. My roommate left to Chicago. Shit kept piling. Then

Eventually I decided to get professional help. They threw me in a mental hospital and shoved me with Wellbutrin. They took blood and urine samples. My sponsoring company knew about the traces of coke and opes and bars from the samples

My government also offers full grants, and I need to explain why I took two semesters off. Mom can't do $50k/year for two years.

I had taken some benadryl, because I haven't slept for a day because I was cramming for a midterm I had today.

I'm considering lapsing. But whiskey is working for now.

I can't study back home because I bailed on the only good college I had registered to there and flew off with no notice.

It may sound kind of cheesy

*What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?*

I guess looking in on the quote it's not so disturbing

In any case

I rent a house with my wife and child. I see people mowing their lawns, going to work, coming home, playing basketball in the front yard. When I start to think about the monotonous repetition of all of this I get headaches, my mood goes down the toilet for days, etc. It wasn't until a few months ago that I think I realized why I was subconsciousness greatly disturbed by what I was witnessing.

*Nothing is really happening*

In my opinion what this all feels like is that all the human race has attempted to do for so long is to survive on our tough planet. Once large portions of us finally pull it off and develop reasonably safe and beneficial social accommodations with each other (and thus 1st world societies) we've effectively beaten the *only* goal humanity ever had. Now it's a big case of buying that MMORPG account, have the damn account, and don't have anything really meaningful left in the game to do.

So my question is this: What do we do now?

I feel like no matter what I do, albeit on an scientific intellectual basis. I feel like practically the entire human race has voluntarily decided to enter some limbo of subconsciousness where we just mindlessly wander around once we don't have starvation breathing down our necks and lions at our heels (insert first-world-problems woman here I guess).

I'm not even that old

It's gotten bad enough that my brain occasionally flashes pictures in my head of what it thinks I would look like tramping through some south american jungle or scuba-diving in the Caribbean. In real life I'm pretty sure I would *hate* doing this stuff but I think my brain is telling me something

I guess most of this is just kinda ranty or whining/complaining, and then just ending up puttering around wasting our time. As if we are culturally/species-ally not ready for this gift, and we don't know what to do with it.

In the end on random days this mostly just sends me into a hyper-critical depression spiral and I feel stuck in my own situation...

She used to be very intelligent. She went to college, but over the past several years that's declined. She's now incapable of learning anything new. We've had computers in the house for as long as anyone else has, but she still can't pick up how to use them beyond how to open her e-mail and play solitaire.

She can't create folders, some people are just bad with technology."" But no, I have been showing her how to do it over and over again for **years**. I even make her step by step tutorials **with pictures**. And she still somehow doesn't get it. (Or she loses the tutorials). Every time she needs to do something, she tries to get me to do it.

Technology is just one example

**My mother is only 55**.

What's worse than her inability to learn is how she acts. She acts like a child sometimes. She'll be very passive aggressive if I won't do everything for her, and storm off. If I ask her to help me with something when it is an inconvenience to her, she'll whine and complain and refuse to do it. I'm the only person who walks the dogs. If I'm busy and ask if she could help me out by walking them, she whines and refuses because she's too busy watching tv. She never exercises, and thus she's obese. She much rather watch a TV show about weight loss than actually work on losing weight.

Which brings me to my next issue with her: All she does is watch shit TV. Her entire world revolves around shit TV. All she thinks about and talks about now is Dancing with the Stars, Big Bang Theory, E! Entertainment News, Dr. Oz, etc... When she gets home from work, she immediately plops down in front of the TV and watches crap until she absolutely has to get up to defrost something for dinner.

My brother is driving my family apart. He's a 30-something educated divorced father who doesn't want to work or move out of my moms house. Ever since I can remember he's been nothing but trouble. From stealing my fathers credit card and going on shopping sprees. The sad part is my mother always defends his actions and NEVER EVER punished him. He graduated from a good university and easily landed a high-paying job. I'm not sure what happened

 He manipulates my mother into supporting him and his family. About two years ago he got a giant chunk of her savings by spewing possible investments in some bullshit. Then spent 6 months with his buddy traveling

Our uncle took him in, and then he's taking off his shirt and throwing random stuff away.  My mom completely fell for this charade despite my sister (who is currently getting her masters in psychology) pleas. He moved back in. We took him to see someone which was completely useless since he doesn't say a word during sessions. After a few weeks, the crazy went away. My sister decides to approach him and ask ""what are your future plans blah blahs blah"" Then bam! three days of crazy. My mother broached the subject a few days after the crazy went away and BOOM.. more crazy. The crazy only comes out when he wants it to come out. We all see it, but my mom does not. 

He's really ruined her financial future, but if I leave now I'll be severing my relationship with my mother and I can't abandon my sister. I have no idea what to do.

I know that there are probably a bunch of people out there that love me, and always try to put on a 'front' of happiness in public so that everyone else won't know that I'm actually upset. But I'm fucking sick of it. I'm tired of hiding my emotions from everyone else, so I'm typing this out.


First of all, so I don't hurt anyone else's feelings, that I just end up pretending to feel stuff that I actually don't. I'm worried that if I say what's on my mind, my friends would get mad, and 'not like me anymore', or some shit...


I don't have many friends either. Basically just two good ones, and when we try to help, doesn't listen and tells us that he's ""not in the mood"". Annoying as hell. Then when either of us utters the most minute complaint, he goes off and tells us to stop complaining. Basically, he thinks that he's above us in some way. Definitely doesn't treat me with respect, let alone my other friend. I seem to get more respect out of him when I ignore him. It's not like I enjoy ignoring him though, I just want to be god damn friends without this whole 'hierarchy' shit.


Then my other friend. She's only really ever concerned about herself, she'll take her damn time, if at all. This doesn't really pertain to anything, but she also feels the need correct everything everyone does. I think she has a need to feel 'smarter' than everyone else. Because she often complains about hating people because they make her feel 'stupid'.


It really just PISSES me off that everyone always seems to be competing against everyone else. I don't give a shit if you're better than me at something


Neither of them listen to me, but never ask me. They act like they're 'competing' with me, or something. I. DON'T. GIVE. A. SHIT. Compete with someone who cares! I just want to be your friend.

My chores from 7-10 years of age were mowing the lawn, raking leaves, sweeping driveway and sidewalk twice a week. My 4 siblings together only had to fold socks and underwear. I did the best I could to brush everything aside. I never spoke up, never got out of line. I maintained straight A's through school. When my stepbrothers got B's and C's, my stepmom said I must be cheating and I was sent to bed without super. My dad never stuck up for me, but I still thought the world of him and considered him my best friend until I turned 25.

After college (didn't finish), bought a house, started a new one, fell in love, got married, pregnant and called my dad first. He was always cool over the phone when my stepmom wasn't around, but i'll never forget his words that day. ""I hope you are getting an abortion, but I thought how can he say that about my child? I'm no pro-lifer
Three years later, and I thought everything was good. Then the distance between phone calls went from 1 to 2 to 4 to 6 months, then nothing. I have called him and sent cards on Father's Day, My birthday, Xmas, every holiday and non holiday. I leave messages. He is very nice to me in emails, replies to them

food + rent. AMA",5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/epuaj/tldr_frustrated_canadian_needs_job_to_get_for/,"**It’s a long read, the last paragraph sums it up. Everything else is just background. **
 
In the 2007/08 school year I battled with heavy depression. I was stressed out about my future career, I conquered my depression after a year.

In 2008 I earned my BSc in Botany but failed to launch my career. I was rejected from dental school a year before due to my poor grades. My psychiatrist and I later discovered that I have an undiagnosed learning disability: ADHD (please don’t debate the merits). I wish I knew this starting university. I only found a brief seasonal job after graduation but nothing came up after the end of summer.

I was frustrated

When September rolled around I continued working full time there and studied full time too since the classes were in the evening. I worked hard and ended up with a B+/A- average for these courses. It’s not spectacular but I am very proud of this achievement. I continued working FT and studying FT for the next year. 

Last August I quit my job. The work that I was hired to do was nearing completion and I wanted to put my full attention on the September recruitment season. I also uncovered that my boss was logging into his business partner’s and employees’ personal email accounts by using the passwords he had stolen using a keylogger. I didn’t check my email from there but I the best move was to wash my hands

Recruitment is important because you can’t become an accountant before you earn a designation. You earn a designation by working for a training firm like PwC, EY, etc. It’s like articling for lawyers. 

For recruitment I printed new business cards, just under a different first name, I wish they had phoned. We spoke and figured out what when wrong after they completed all their interviews and had already given out all their offers.  

I just worked my ass off the last year to be stumped by this stupid little thing. I am deflated and morale is low. 

I’ve been applying for other career related jobs this entire term while taking one class. I’ve reached the point that I’ll just take any job because I NEED money. Pizzeria a block away was hiring; couldn’t get the job. I’m stressed to the point that when I donate blood the nurses said I had high blood pressure, sit on community committees, regularly donate blood, fundraised for multiple charities in the past, etc. I’ve given a lot to my community so why? 

Stressful situations changes people’s value system and I’m no exception. Maybe Gordon Gekko was right, Australia, etc. I would go too if I secured the job and visa beforehand.  

**Paying rent is painful. I just reached into my savings this month. I write a new cover letter and submit to a new job posting every other day. It used to be more but it’s exhausting after 3 months. I live in Vancouver and we have 2 serious problems that may become my only options: drugs or homelessness. Some people here water plants and make $120k/yr. I’d rather be a professional criminal using my botany degree and accounting skills than being hungry and homeless citizen.**

Back Story: my sister is a liar

She'll also come over and give you a sob story about how she has no money and needs to use your computer to ""find a job"". You say ok

Cut to 2 hours later and I'm explaining how I set a clear boundary and she needs to give up the goods because I work from home and need to get back to work. This all the while I'm feeding her and giving her things to sell at the local consignment store.

She's been a heroin addict for a few years now. But beyond the heroin she's just your normal trouble maker. Constantly stealing and justifying it because she has no money. To her the world owes her everything. She's a practiced scam artist. Has developed a fake name to go with the fake social security number. This is used with cops and for medical attention.

Over the past year and a half I've kinda cut her off. 

Every reach out I get is over text and in some attempt to help her.

I've moved into the mindset that I do not want to meet her where I am in any but a position of a peer. 

I'm simply broken. I don't want to get hurt anymore. I feel terrible guilt

But I can not do it anymore.

I don't want her drama.

I've done my work. I've shaken a lot of the shackles from chaotic family of origin. Got my obsessions

After getting this phone call today all I could do was imagine the worst. I'd show up to the ghetto hospital. Not be able to find or get in touch with her because as usual she's unreliable.

Let's say I did. Then what?

She's perpetually homeless. She'll want to stay in my tiny apartment I share with my comes-from-a-healthy-family partner. I would never do that to my better half. This is our home and it must be a calm and safe place. After growing up like we did and refuse to live with the same chaos and drama if even for a second.

Ya see

I think she looked up to me way to much for my age. In her mind I let her down. 

I'm rambling here aren't I?

here's what I would like. 

Help me find the correct and healthy mind space to deal with her.

I know the hardest part is that I want to change her. I know this is a big part of 12 step/co-dependent work. You must accept that you can't.

But even if I can't. How do I have even the smallest relationship with someone so resentful

and what I mean is she did this to herself. Her carelessness is a part of her disease. She is actively trying to hurt herself.

I made it clear 3 years ago. If you end up in jail

Although I have experience working with dogs, alone, at the end of the day, that I wouldn't be needed anymore and I needn't bother talking to anyone else; 2) She accused me of loosing control of the dogs after she left the gate unlocked twice and I had to leap over a fence and push dogs that weigh more than me back into the pen to prevent a total disaster.

This place was completely chaotic. Getting bit was to be expected, non-smoking, socially awkward girl-nerd. I did not fit in at this crusty hipster-run dog place. I was relieved that I didn't have to get up at 5 AM the next day and work outdoors in the cold. I also was immediately offered a temp job, so there was no time to wallow or get angry. I didn't talk to the owner because I didn't want to cry or further embarrass myself, and I knew I had nothing to gain. I worked there for 2 weeks, so of course I won't put this on my resume or use them as a reference.

I was fired on a Thursday and my paycheck arrived by mail on Tuesday, but I've hd a negative balance all week. (I've been meaning to call my bank, but I've been really busy.)
Now my checking account is at -$121 because I made a payment on my credit card after the paycheck showed up in my account online. I was also charged a $33 overdraft fee. I plan on calling my bank tomorrow.

I am trying to keep calm, but I need it really bad. Should I have a friend call them pretending to be a legal service or a lawyer's assistant? Should I pay a lawyer to send them a scary letter? Should I have sex with a lawyer so he'll do this? Should I call 911 and tell them to arrest my ex-boss? How much would it cost me to take them to small claims court? More than my measly paycheck?

First off, educated me and raised me to be agnostic ""We have Jewish, Muslim and Christian relatives - respect that so they can respect your belief too."" He and my mother have been married for 17 years. He's funny, understanding and loves me.

So, he had to leave her for his last year and he moved half way around the world for a year. They talked about it and he told my mother that when he was able to support her, he would come back. From the way they put it, they were not broken up and was doing a long distance relationship. 

My mother then hung out with her friends and got drunk. She said she was young and got drunk. Subsequently a guy at the party (doesn't even remember his name) took advantage of her and got her pregnant. She said she was thinking of aborting me but decided against it. She had me by herself and told me that she did not have the strength to tell my father over the phone or in a letter. She wanted to tell him face to face but did not want to ruin his life by adding turmoil (remember

He found out about me the 2nd day he came back. At first he was mad, ""That's bullshit and you know it!!"" Then my father threw him across the room (literally over a dining room table and then leaped over to kick the shit out him for suggesting other wise. Yes, my father is awesome. My uncle is a serial cheater and is a deadbeat dad to my cousin). No one in my 18 years has ever told me that I was not his biological daughter because of this event. I only found out about this a couple of months ago.

I was raised by a wonderful man who raised me as best he could, donated to charity and has volunteered his services in South East Asia.

Anyway
A few years ago, and she decided she wanted to leave my stepdad for this guy. So, instead of filing for divorce or anything else a mature adult would do, she packed her bags, dropped me and my brother off at my grandmother's house and took off to meet internet dude #1. I was loyal, and brainwashed, and ill-informed, after I hadn't heard from her

A year later, begs stepdad to come back, and he accepts. 

Two years after that, bye,"" she hops in a cab and she's off to the air port, headed for Africa. I don't hear from her for two weeks, and I start to assume she wound up homeless and murdered. 

Suddenly, I just wanted to let you know I'm okay. Call me."" I ask her when she's planning on coming back, and she isn't. So I call her, and she seems happy as a clam. She's living with the love of her life, married in Africa, and after a few months she says she's pregnant (despite having her tubes burnt a decade ago). I'm stunned by all of this, so I try to maintain as though it didn't happen. 

Eventually, but my stepdad says no. I check my voicemail on christmas morning; She wanted to let me know that it was all planned out. She *actually* only left because she actually had cancer, and she didn't want us to see her suffer. 

Which is total horseshit. She left a stockpile of chat logs and webcam videos of herself marching the penguin for this guy in Africa. 

There's several things that really piss me off. She could have left if she wanted to, was 9, and super attached to her. He can't even talk about the situation without crying. I love my brother a lot more than I love her, or even myself, so seeing him like that because of her makes my blood boil. The other thing is the non-stop lying. Plus, now that she's gone and everyone's telling stories, I'm finding out about a metric asston of other things she lied about... Like my goddamned education (which now I have to climb an electric fence to get things I shouldn't even need to consider).

So
""She just isn't well
""Christ would forgive her""
""It's the only mother you have""
Am I wrong in **not** returning my mother to mommy-dearest status upon her return? Is it wrong that my little brother now wants nothing to do with her?

1376081283.0,1k1st2,I am a trainwreck! How do I stop?!,I_am_a_trainwreck,14,2,15,"I have come to accept that I am a complete and utter trainwreck. I am ruining my own life and I dont know why I keep doing it. I am sick!

I used to have many issues with keeping relationships (platonic and romantic) and was a little lost when I was a younger adult, and made some awesome friends that I was so proud to know...but then all of that changed again.

About a year ago I left for a study abroad program in Asia for 6 months. I had a horrid time! I did not get along with anyone in the program and was all out bullied for reasons I still dont understand. It made me feel as if my friendships while in college were just a fluke

I had compelted my last semester at Uni with the study abroad program, it was in a town that I had no friends in, I had no car or savings, could not get ANY kind of job (the town has a 17% unemployment rate!!) So I continued to become very depressed and isolated. The point of moving home was to temporarily live there (6 months max) while I applied for jobs to move back to the city where I went to college. However, I applied to over 200 jobs and didnt get a single interview. It was discouraging.

My solution? I didnt file for my bachelors and instead just kept going to school for another semester so I could move back to the city I wanted to live in and my finaid would cover it. I am doing that now. But I have no idea what to do when I am done in a few months. Its back to my situation post-Asia. And I am on a year lease with no income coming in after I graduate (again) in Fall.

Also, I actually came home crying a few times so I just quit one day despite not having a backup and desperately needing a paycheck. It was a bad decision that I deeply regret.

I also have been acting out in very self-destructive ways. I have been having serious emotional outbursts where I sometimes cry for hours and will call people nonstop until they answer. My friends have just stopped answering (understandably). I have never gotten serious attention from men like I wanted (guys dont see me as ""relationship worthy"") and lately have been aggressively seeking sexual partners and then acting surprised when they tell me its nothing more than FWB. I have essentially slept will all my guy friends and now a few wont talk to me since they got girlfriends and all their girlfriends hate me even though I honestly dont come on to their boyfriends anymore (I would never condone or participate in cheating behavior).

My drinking is out of control. Ive always been a heavy social drinker

I have essentially ruined or am ruining my relationships with my once coveted friends because of my dramatic antics. I dont know if they are repairable and I feel my reputation is permanently damaged. I also am worried I will never get a good job now that I have a misdemeanor on my record.

I tried going to my university services to get psychological help but I dont feel I can afford the services right now...I need advice reddit on how to turn my life back around!! Why do I fall into these cycles??

My boyfriend and I live together, we are doing pretty well for ourselves.


However, to no avail, and now their unemployment is running out. His younger sister also can't find a job (though I can't speak for how thoroughly she is searching.)

We are considering trying to rent a house for them to stay with us for a year until they get a job. There are obviously SO many things wrong with this option


His parents and sister are currently living in an RV park, gas for getting to interviews- there is NO public transit where they live). 


My mother thinks my boyfriend and I shouldn't be having to deal with this, and maybe welfare, though the welfare may not be approved in time for it to even matter. (oh, they also can't make money via blood donations, because they lived in a country with potentially unfiltered water for several years.)

I'd like to thank everyone for their advice


I know a lot of people have just told me to drop it and walk away, and are practically married (we just haven't had time for ceremony and such, and are not big on marriage anyway.) I suppose my wording made it sound like we weren't as close as that? That walking away from him and his family was an option at all? If I had said that he was my fiance, or my husband, would that have changed anyone's advice?


I'm going to email his mom directly, to him, is to have them move in with us. We can't afford that, and I (and I know his mother agrees with me) don't think it will actually help them in the way he thinks it will. I'm going to ask them what kind of help they have searched for (welfare, stamps, etc.) and encourage them to take those routes while we can help them with any extra emergencies (car breaks down, need emergency gas for an interview, and will even offer to help find job postings close to where they live (I understand where her daughter is: just graduated high school.

It was kind of a weird situation, along with the rest of the class, saw the video as part of my project.

At the time

What makes me even more uncomfortable about this situation is the video of this incident has around a million views on YouTube. I do not know if my teacher has seen the video or not.

Last year, I feel very guilty about earning money from the video.

In a few months, and apologizing for the incident. In the letter I would include a check for $100 dollars (the earnings from the video). As my teacher is the star of the video, I think it is appropriate for him to earn the money from the video. After I sent the letter, I would delete the video.

I do see some problems with this solution... I don't want this situation to blow up into a big deal, but it is a possibility).

So basically I'm looking for advice on this situation... should I just delete the video and try and forget about it? Or do you think I should bring up the situation with my old teacher and give him the earnings to try and correct me wrong? I think apologizing is the right thing to do. But apologizing could have some unintended consequences and it may be better just to let things drop.

I thought about trying to make the wall sound proof but that can be expensive and might not even work.
I haven't tried ear plugs yet but I will since I've run out of options but I hate to think this is what I have to resort to in my own home.

**MY SITUATION**

1) My dad used to abuse me and I am a broken individual as a result.

2) While living in that abusive environment and before I knew any better

3) My mental state is deteriorating rapidly.

4) I am literally slipping into mental illness and experience what I can only describe as persistent tactile hallucinations.

5) I hate myself so much I can't even type it.

6) **MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, ever, or I will get in legal trouble and have to register as a sex offender.

7) And now, were floored to discover, last month, that my dad used to regularly beat the shit out of me. I always resented my mom for not sticking up for me, but she never knew because he never hit me around her (I never pieced that together). Furthermore, he apparently never laid a hand on my brothers, so he just picked me at random to abuse.

8) The effect of learning #7 is like a lifelong ""plot twist"" that I don't know how to recover from. The damage to my psyche from #7 has been extreme. I don't understand the big picture of my life anymore and I'm losing my grasp on normal everyday functioning as a result. I'm spiraling down into depression and don't know what to do.

**Summary**: I don't know what to do. I really need help, but now I'm losing my ability to do that. Some days I just sit inside the house and cry without leaving my house. I need help and I can't get it. I don't know what to do.

---------

EDIT: I'm going to elaborate on the above.

My dad abused me pretty regularly, but pretty much up until that line he used to beat the shit out of me pretty good.

#2 on my list is what has caused me to become unraveled. I am now 25, sexual nature. The other person was between age 1-2 at the time and remembers nothing and wasn't hurt. If this disgusts you, then it fucking disgusts me too, now that I'm an adult with a working brain and I understand the entire situation and know how to separate ""abuse"" from ""normal stuff.""

Since that day in college when I first contemplated my childhood with a clear head, I hadn't even realized it, and, to put the cherry on top, I had repeated the cycle of abuse without realizing that I was abusing or that ""abuse"" was involved in any capacity. I felt sorry for myself after realizing I was abused for about 3 seconds, until I realized I had also done abusive things; then my self-pity was replaced by nothing but utter hatred for myself and self-loathing. I have since since contemplated suicide many, many times. 

I mean the following statement literally: the thought of contemplating suicide for the first time did something fucked up to my mind and created, I mean that literally: something has clearly snapped in my brain and I am worrying that I'm becoming schizophrenic. Every day this weird feeling is there and it's slowly but surely fucking more and more with my concentration and ability to function. In the 8 years since, that feeling has never gone away.

I can't handle it anymore. I don't know how to. I am dead inside every day. And, I will never get sympathy from anyone. I'm no longer a victim but now I'm the bad guy, even if I was 14 at the time. I can never tell anyone, or else they will hate me. Furthermore, people already hate me; they just don't know it because they don't know what happened, and the parents of the child involved hate me more than anyone, though they don't realize it. I will never be able to get close enough to anyone to trust them with this information. The fact that I was abused for ~18 years now means nothing because of my three incidents when I was 14.

I clearly am developing a serious mental illness and need to go to therapy. But, the therapist is legally mandated to report me. If you don't believe me, look it up. This is despite that I was in an abusive situation myself, literally didn't know ""right"" from ""wrong"" at the time, was underage, and have no desire to do anything like that again; the law is that the therapist must report me. Thus, I can never discuss this topic in therapy or I will become a sex offender, there is no point of therapy for me. My Mom knows about this and wants me to just ""figure it out."" I can't figure it out and I'm losing my grip on reality.

Since learning about #7, while in the abusive environment, had an incident where I abused myself, I can't or I'll have to register as a sex offender, despite not having any desire to abuse anyone or do anything like that at all now that I'm an adult who's out of the situation and can see it clearly.

In short, I can never go to therapy and discuss this subject, because of the law.

Please give me advice. I don't know what to do. I need to find a way to go to therapy and not go to jail. If that's not possible then my situation is hopeless.

**PS:** if your response is going to be something like FUCK YOU because of #2

**SECOND EDIT:** I appreciate the encouragement, specifically because they fuck people in my situation over, so I'm not just making it up; [I wrote a comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1a7j14/i_feel_like_my_mental_state_is_spiraling_out_of/c8vn0w2) with the details.

Most people, furthermore, there's also widespread criticism about the concept of a 14 year old kid, especially one who was abused and getting the shit kicked out of him regularly and didn't know right from wrong at the time, having to register as a sex offender for life and being lumped in with the first group.  Since the law is *so* broad in that respect, the law has spawned a wave of ""gray area"" legal cases similar to mine, and I expect the juvenile sex offender registry sections will probably be overturned eventually as the courts work their way through it

The laws I'm talking about are real; they're brand new, and that's even dumber than my situation; it's the result of the same laws that I'm talking about. Society is still figuring it out.

I'm sorry to make this so so fucking sad, and at that point society decided I was irrevocably broken and no longer gives a shit about me. I'm not making that up. I clearly need help, but I am not allowed to get the help I need because of that judgment from society, and I don't know what to do.

I don't. I've always tried, I can listen to the song intently and not get how on earth they got that meaning from it. It doesn't make any sense.

Second, I really don't care at all, it's stupid and useless to me. I don't like feeling this way. I want to care; I want to enjoy music.

Most people use music as an emotional outlet. They use it to express themselves or to help them through tough times or to lift their spirits or to make them feel good. When *I* listen to music

It's so frustrating, artists, etc. None of it works.

Honestly, this is *literally* ruining my life, at least on an emotional level. I'm getting closer and closer to a complete mental breakdown, because it weighs on me more and more every day.

1358738309.0,16ytsj,My girl has strange seizures. Please help.,PeanutsInABag,18,7,25,"Hey guys

this story is a little complicated. I'm not asking for advice for myself

Background: I'[m] 24, currently working here and will do so until going to her home country in July. After meeting each other a few months ago and things progressing, we've been in a pretty intense relationship the last few weeks. THE RELATIONSHIP IS FINE. What I'm asking advice for is something that's happened to her three times, and which is starting to worry me. The connection between the seizures seems to be lack of sleep and physical exhaustion through sex (the first two times) or alcohol (the last time). 

Let's call her Sarah. During the last few weeks

This is what happens:

- First, sometimes repeatedly, and then just slumps together wherever she is. She will literally not be able to stand up. The second seizure happened after sex in the bathroom, and I had to hold her up and carry her to bed. It's as if she's passed out drunk, she makes no effort to keep herself up, all she can do is roll around and maybe grab a blanket to cover herself. If she rolls on the edge of the bed, she will fall off

- She gets upset. Really upset. It's as if she's living through a bad dream while still awake. Well, the answers are incoherent. At the same time, she'll call my name in a pretty desperate voice when I'm not in the room, but when I'm there, she can forget what my name was. During the first seizure she started sobbing, saying ""I'm so sorry...I'm not a good person!"" She kept repeating this. During the third seizure, she started crying, and said ""I don't know"" instead of ""I know, she was not so upset

- This is the scariest part: The seizure makes her black out. When she returns to her normal state, she gives me this incredulous stare. After the third seizure, she was (understandably) very upset, apologising for ""scaring me"".

This all lasts between 10 minutes and half an hour. I've found myself surprisingly calm when it's happened, talked to her, tried to get her to snap out of it. But soon I'll be gone, and I fear that she will have these episodes happen to her increasingly. So I come here to ask for advice. Yes, I know, go see a doctor, go see a therapist. I've told her this. The problem is that she doesn't have the money for that, either, and I know that trying to deal with shit alone is stupid. 

A few things about her that might help you gain insight about her psychology:

- She often puts blame on herself and feels she should do more for people

- She grew up in a poor suburban place

- She's very smart and creative. She's studied law

- She is often sad about me leaving. She is very fond of me. I am very fond of her too, for selfish reasons.

I would be thankful for any kind of response, and I'm worried about her health.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,

A little background on me:

About me!
- I am a male in my mid-early 20s. 
- I live in Western Canada.
- I am shy.

Education!
- I did not do well in high school
- A lot of the courses I took are transferable to other institutions.
- As soon as I realized how much I did not want to be an accountant
- I quite enjoy working with my hands, I like to think of ways to make a better product, or how something is made)
- Thankfully

Jerbs!
- Currently, I worked in computer repair. I have no problems with computer stuff (hardware, at least).
- Seeing as how I work in retail, and then have a day off, a mid-day shift, then two days off. Retail hours, basically.

Home life and interests!
- I am not suicidal and have no plans of self-harm. I went through a phase of being majorly depressed many years ago
- I live at home
- I don't really do that much these days except for go to work, I don't really have that many interests anymore. Video games aren't interesting to me anymore, and I don't really have any IRL hobbies. 
- Since I graduated from high school (more than 5 and less than 10 years ago), it's mostly internet friends I talk to almost all of the time. To put it into perspective, I have maybe 40 facebook friends, I haven't posted anything there since February 2011, and don't use the chat feature or anything. I would say I have maybe 3 IRL friends. 
- I also enjoy graphics and design. I love seeing how things all fit together and how they're made. 

So

- Careers and jerbs: 
I'm still having trouble deciding on what I want to do. There are a few things I'm interested in, and to do that you need to have a company sponsor you as an apprentice, and to do that you need to work for said company, but to work for any company, you already need to be an apprentice. 
I'm also not sure about my existing job. I'm only really there for the (frankly insulting) paycheck

- Hobbies
It really feels like on weekends I don't have to work

- Friends
It feels like I don't really have any friends that I can hang out with and just have a fun time with. Most of the time

I'm sitting here at home, I feel like I might be losing my mind. 

I can't talk to anybody about this but I crave external input. I don't know really know how to articulate it but I'm going to try my best here. I feel like there is something fundamentally wrong with me, I don't know if it's normal and I'm just being hypocondriac or if I'm legitimately nuts. 

Often I'm angry or sad, I feel like I'm being wronged, they don't appreciate me, my bosses are idiots, a feeling many of you can relate to I'm sure the problem is when I'm thinking this way it's a very dangerous possibility. All it would take is a trigger and I'd be off, sometimes I even get violent impulses, like if somebody were to raise their voice to me my first impulse is to snap. It's a caveman reaction but it's seems completely reasonable at the time.

 This feeling can persist for days or weeks and then it will fade, I tend to be goofy and I have a hard time keeping myself composed, most often I'm sad, it could be like a dull ache and I'll find myself daydreaming a lot or a crippling misery that makes me terribly insecure and I have a hard time interacting with people. 

More often than not, it will start out fine but after a few minutes I just get absorbed back into my own thoughts or I just lose interest, it can make me seem stand offish or awkward. Yet other times, and it could be with the same people as before about similar topics and I feel totally engaged, confident and alert, other times I'm too into it and I feel like I might be talking too much. I can't focus on any long term goals because I'll make plans one day and the very next I'll be completely uninterested, it could be because I'm feeling blue and can't see the point or it could be that I feel great and so why hit the gym when I like who I am right now perfectly fine? I keep telling myself that I just need discipline, I find after a time I distance myself from friends after a certain point. 

Girls are an even bigger problem. I sometimes get paranoid and I feel like people are screwing me behind my back. I'm in a relationship right now and I often feel like she's not telling me something or I pick up on ""clues"" like body language or she'll mention a guy friend and red flags go off in my head and I create all these scenarios with circumstancial evidence where she's cheating on me, how crazy am I?

And then I'll be fine, I just feel like I'm acting wrong or different, or I'll blow something trivial into something huge and beat myself up over it, I get this feeling of guilt that just stays for what seems like forever. This leads to me becoming irritatable or depressed, which launches me right back into the rollercoaster of highs and lows that leave me feeling like I'm going to meltdown. I haven't been able to stay at one place for very long or hang with the same group for too long because eventually I'll have an episode where all this stress builds up and I do something stupid, like say fuck it and quit my job, or get into a fistfight with my roommate or try to OD on morphine and up in the hospital. I have a bag of clothes and a laptop to my name because I'm just terrible at holding on to anything.

The only downside is it made me feel like a zombie, I never seemed to hit my social phase or really have a good laugh from the gut while I was on them, if that makes sense. Eventually I ran out so I turned to opiates, which only made the mood swings worse but mostly I felt great on them, this eventually led to a heroin addiction which resulted in why I'm clean today. 

I've wondered many times if I'm bi polar (my father is diagnosed bipolar) but I've read up a lot about it and the ""cycles"" don't seem to fit. I've talked to doctors before but not never followed up treatment nor got a diagnosis (except for depression at 16

Is this normal? Could be it be one thing that's fucking me up like a chemical imbalance or are there multiple issues? I can't afford to see a doctor

TL:DR Can a person know if they're losing their mind?

http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wtsdp/whats_the_best_way_to_get_my_coworker_to_stop/

I thought I’d give everyone who helped out an update.  The general consensus in the original thread seemed to be to let Tim know when he’d interrupted someone

I tried that a few times, Tim did not get the message.  As lunch continued to turn into the “listen to Tim talk” hour, I started doing other things on my lunches.  Going for walks, going for coffee, running an errand, and inviting along just a member or two of the group.  Eventually Tim was left eating lunches alone for a bit, actually.

Today I decided I’d eat with the group and try to get everyone to eat together.  Tim interrupted me, and I just left.  This was probably not the best way to handle it.  I’m not sure if I made myself look worse or not, but I don’t really care.  This was the last resort for me after dropping hints, suggesting politely he not interrupt, and spending a week or two of lunches on my own in hopes of getting over it, but I just couldn’t shake it when he talked over me and cut me off *again*.

I’m not sure if I will eat lunch with the group again

Either way

All joking aside this is what I deal with on a daily basis. I work in a  field were there are absolute answers and logic dictates action. People seek me out for information because I know how to communicate information effectively (at least I think so and have been told so), but i just wish that they would attempt to learn rather than be lazy. 

I used to just get annoyed and be in a bad mood. I'd go home in a bad mood, or just be angry. Usually this would be the result of getting home and having to make decisions as well. Not that those were my wife being stupid, just average what do you want to do this weekend, what do you want to eat, lets work on our budget, and so on kinda things. But still I get worked up because I'm just so infuriated by work.

Currently someone will come to me and ask for help. I'll usually get snippy with them and ask them what they did to look it up. Usually nothing. This is also followed with my asking them what they want to do or think. At this point almost regardless of the answer I tell them that what they want to do is correct and send them on their way. I've stopped trying to teach them how to use logic

As a result I feel that 99% of what I do is also a waste because the actions these people are taking are seen as status quo. This further infuriates me because I'm not in a position to ""change the world"" so to speak

I decided that something needed to change so I took a week of work experience in France and then forced myself into planning a month long expedition to Tanzania. Somehow I managed to get through the year of training (I'd never camped before) and completed the trip without being a burden - which was my personal target. I managed self respect, and finally decided I needed another big push - so I wrangled my way into a University abroad


---


All that I've managed to do in those 6 months since I arrived is adapt around my new life to return to the laziest existence I can get away with:

* I have gained and kept only three friends

* I've always been extremely solitary (I was lucky and got myself a single room), but I'm frankly getting very lonely. It's not as if I am socially incompetent, I just don't care.

* I've tried to gain hobbies or join clubs, drawing and such (not big on sports) but they all died eventually. I've given up on all but one club, too. The moment a potentially awkward moment or a reason to not work on them appears, the whole thing crashes to a halt - this could be a time frame of a few days or a few months, but it is always inevitable.

* The result of this is that I do not spend my free time doing anything but being content. I understand that even gaming is a hobby, mostly to pass time till the next lecture or a new piece of content. Or even just so I can forget it all while asleep. I don't even dream.

* Compound this with a normal lack of direction, history, but I've dropped two courses so far and lowered my workload this semester to almost nothing because I couldn't handle the (in hindsight, quite moderate) workload of last semester.

* As a relevant aside, ""I would like to go out with her"". I just don't have that concept in my head. Since I myself cannot tell if I like her, I certainly can't tell if she approves of me, and even were that the case I would not know how to step forward from there. It's like I missed something while growing up, something major.


This has come to a culmination last week, I have half eaten food all over the place that is only there because it doesn't yet smell. I'd spend most of my time wasting seconds away, and the rest freaking out about where my life is going - hell I questioned my own sexual orientation for a while and then realised it's basically moot either-way, since nothing in my life would change. I saw only one person and I both embraced the social contact and was upset I was being dragged outside. I'm in a rut which I've been digging for months and I can't will myself to get out for more than five minutes. Hell, I'm asking the internet for advice before my oldest friends. I need some help.

I'm Canadian. My boyfriend is Irish. For the past four years, he must by law prove that he is more qualified than any Canadian in any position for which he applies. Even should he provide that proof, many employers are unwilling to hire a non-citizen due to the extra paperwork and rigmarole such a hiring involves. We have already had to move once, to an awful industrial town of 1200 people in the middle of last winter, which was an isolating and horrible experience for us both. I have been supporting us on my small journalist's income for roughly 3/4 of our relationship.

His last contract ended in June. To our great joy, I just lost my job without notice due to budget cuts a the paper at which I've been employed for nearly two years. I received a tiny severance package that is rapidly dwindling. Now he must almost certainly give up on the prospect of being a Canadian citizen.

We heard the news about this latest rejection while we were at my mom's place, begging out loud to no one to just let him find work and stay legal here. I have had a difficult life by anyone's standards: death of one of my parents, trouble with addiction, valiantly struggling to make sense of it all as we all do. He has been instrumental to my mental health and recovery and I will be grateful for that for as long as I live.

I really need help.

After my family recently had a court order placed on him for mental evaluation, he also thinks it's some sort of mind control. Mental problems have been a recurring problem throughout his life (in his early teens he was telling family members he worked for the C.I.A.), and he has also had a lot of criminal problems leading to jail sentences multiple times.

Apparently we cannot even threaten to kick him out without 60 days notice (in comparison to 30 if he did pay rent which makes no sense). Now that he is out of the hospital and off of the medication he is getting worse again. He cannot hold a job and he cannot maintain stable relationships and has become exceedingly racist (he had a black girlfriend which I'm assuming provoked some of this). He recently has acquired a copy of the book ""The Biggest Secret"" by David Irke which he is encouraging me proves each of his theories. The author apparently went on television once and told everyone he was the son of Christ and we were gonna die in natural disasters. I'd like to reinterate he has had these thoughts well before any mention of this book

I have just now recorded a rant of his (Nazis/Hitler, Jesus, Sex Slavery, Ressurection, Cloning, 2012 - some of his topics) with him confirming his name and date of birth. What can I do to force him to get some further help? Our family can't live like this and neither can he.

I'm 20 years old, albeit mediocre life.  I've always been extremely nervous my entire life, and about 4 years ago I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  Events escalated and I had to end up dropping out of high school my senior year, and getting my diploma through the local community college.  Panic attacks and anxiety have been on and off for my through these last 4 years.  I've been on medication here and there, but nothing really long term.  I've always been afraid and weary of going on medication, especially something that alters my brain chemistry.  I mean, surely people have dealt and combated something like this before the age of medicine? What am I doing wrong?  
About 4 months ago my anxiety hit another spike, but getting bad again.  It got to the point where I ended up quitting my part-time job that I had for 3 1/2 years.  A decision that I still regret to this day.  I told myself that during this time, I will get help.  I've procrastinated and procrastinated about it for months, I finally saw a therapist for the first time about 5 days ago, and will be seeing him once every three weeks.  
I guess what my point i'm trying to make here is that I am absolutely terrified of what's happening, but at this rate, it will be gone in about 5 months. I'm not in school, either.  I've been trying to get by doing some computer repair jobs here and there, but most of them my anxiety tends to wiggle its way in, and prevent me from even leaving my house.  
I can't help but feel like a disappointment to my friends, but lately I've been pushing everyone away, and hiding from the world.  
Back in grade school and high school, it's like there are so many potential paths and situations to go down, that I just freeze up instead of getting motivation.  I get overwhelmed to the fact that I have no idea what to do, so I stress out, and end up pissing the day away in front of my computer.  
I don't really know what I'm getting at, and to get a new job.  I just don't know what to do to get to that point, and I don't know if i'll have the confidence and the courage to stand up to my anxiety if it comes back.  I don't want to let anyone down, like I feel that I have.  I just want to start doing something with my life already.

Please bear with the verbosity. This post is a cross between a rant and a plea for help. I recommend grabbing a bag of popcorn for the best experience.

The Whole Deal:
I'm a 26-year old male living with my parents in a suburban house

Perhaps foremost among the problems is the my asymmetrical relationship with my parents. My mother and I have a very close relationship. We are each other's best friends and most trusted advisors. The vibe between me and my father is the exact antithesis of that. It has been this way for over 16 years. For even longer than that, their relationship degenerated into that of two strangers cohabiting (no exaggeration), and has not improved beyond that ever since. Neither of them ever bothered to veil their mutual disdain. Whereas any normal couple would have divorced long ago, they have stuck together because of societal pressure (it's highly taboo in their culture). I doubt their marriage has ever been in a better state, since it was forced upon them by their parents. I can't imagine my mother willingly marrying my father - they have nothing in common.

As my mother has just one good friend beside myself, my father hasn't brought a single dollar home in 14 years anyway. She recently confided in me what I implicitly understood all along - that I was the only reason she didn't kill herself when I was a child. I have a sickening feeling things haven't changed much for her since then.

And now to segue into the shackles held by my father. Over the years, faked. The doctors found nothing wrong. He hasn't touched his medicine in months (I've measured). He's gone to the ER twice, being sent back both times (""well, I guess it must have subsided as I was waiting""). Calling him out on it will get me a torrent of insults, to the effect of ""you shameless bastard! You don't believe your dying father!"". Raising the idea of leaving home will prompt that and another faked attack.

I'm losing my mind. This place began to feel like a prison years ago, and I'm socially inept - been this way since the age of 12. My life thus far has been a haze of monotony, the majority of which has been wasted in front of keyboards. I've been moderately depressed (often suicidal) for longer than I can remember. I've haven't been out of the city since the age of 14. It's been school, reading, work, reading, work, work …

I haven't' experienced anything in life besides books and computers. I don't know how to build a social network. I don't know how to negotiate business transactions. I don't know the prerequisites for living on my own, having a credit card, dealing with pests, etc.

But something is going to snap. Soon. Before it does

  My main concern is my mother, was a doctor. He supported the family, and my mother never felt the need to go to college or look for a serious career. She was mostly a stay at home mom.

My son, as am I. He doesn't want this, but it's here. One of the reasons he doesn't want this is that he doesn't really like the girl he got pregnant. She was just....a benefit. The girl likes him way more than he likes her. She was on birth control, but has now said that she ""forgot to take it one time."" I don't buy that. I don't think that skipping one pill makes one instantly able to get pregnant. I have my suspicions that this was a trap. However, I know that the pill isn't 100% effective, so there's always that tiny little chance. I've already told him that birth control is BOTH parties responsibility. I wont berate him over this, because he is upset and doing that wont help, but in this case he doesn't. He now knows he will be connected to her for the rest of his life. 

I didn't imagine this would happen this way. I have two kids, I am totally sad for my son. His life is forever changed now. I know that sounds negative, and a little baby is a positive thing...at least one ought to say that to be PC. It just makes me sad to think that this child will be born into a broken home. That's not fair to him/her. Also, I just can't shake the feeling that my son has had something forced onto him that he didn't want. HOWEVER, it is his fault if he didn't want to ever have kids. HE should have made sure that didn't happen, either by always wearing a condom, or NOT having sex...the latter being hard to do I know.

This all seems to me like something that just wouldn't happen to us. I know that sounds elitist

Don't get me wrong. I love babies. Even though I had the opinion that my kids ought not to have any kids, that I'm going to have to shoulder some of all this. I'm fine with that.

I guess I'm wanting some advice from any of you young people who have had a child in the same situations as my son. How did you cope? What did you do that made it not so scary? I can give him all the advice I can on child raising...I raised two from infancy. BUT, and we were in the same house. This will be different.

I work in an office for a large corporation doing mostly accounts payable, and a little HR on the side. I hate it, but it's not because of the job itself (I don't think). I've never felt fulfilled a single day in my life; I just have no idea what I really want to be, besides a wife and a mom. And honestly, that's all I ever want to be, but it's not at all realistic.

I guess that's the real issue here.

A little background before I start:  My parents split when I was about 10, my brother went to live with our dad who was fighting for custody of him at my brother's own request. My mom had started drinking shortly before this, and it progressively got worse until she was a raging, abusive alcoholic and I was the only one around for her to take her anger out on. It wasn't pretty at all, but I endured the worst of it for nearly two years before my dad found out and got custody of me as well.

Now, I at least let her have my phone number. She calls every few months, and I honestly do my best to minimize contact beyond these. I'm nice, and I don't treat her badly because she seems like she is really trying to have a normal relationship with me, but it's strained. She usually sneaks in a bit of guilting that I don't go out of my way to contact her, but I can normally shrug it off and move on. Half the time she doesn't even answer when I try to initiate a call. 

And then at 11:30 tonight

Except now she's completely and totally wasted

The conversation started out alright, who proceeds to ask me the same things, with declining coherency. He finally hands the phone back to my mother (which is good, because I *do not like* him. He makes me uncomfortable.), who then proceeds to start with the usual ""You never call me, you never come see me"" bit.

Except this time, I won't make time for her, and that I'm probably not telling my brother to call her like she wants because she hasn't gotten one from him. How I purposely didn't call her on mother's day or her birthday. I try to explain, through my shock and growing upset (both at the realization she's calling me drunk to basically tell me I'm a shitty daughter) that I don't have time. I'm a college student (doing summer classes right now) and I work, so I don't really have time to jump up and ask my dad to drive me 4-5 hours to see her any random time. 

Apparently, why won't I make time for her? And then she hands off the phone to her husband *once again*.

I get the same spiel from him, I'm so upset I have pretty much stopped answering, claimed the signal was going out so the call was breaking up, promised to try and make time to see her, and hung up. There was also something going on in the background about me having seven boyfriends or something.

I don't know how to handle this anymore. 

No, and how she refuses to acknowledge any of it happened. I've tried to contact her when she's given me radio silence for months.

I'm upset and hurt, when she's made no effort to return the attempts. And the worst of it all is she got her husband in on it too.

I don't know if I'm in the right or the wrong anymore

(As a pre-cursor: An ex-roommate of mine was getting evicted for not paying the last two months worth of rent and skipped out of town a few days prior to this incident.)

A friend of ours from San Antonio was making his way through Austin around midnight and asked if he could crash on the couch and take off the next morning. He also happened to have his dog with him. 

So the next morning comes and the head location manager for our apartments came through to evict the ex-roommate. We told her the room was exactly how he left it and she locked the door. Before leaving

Next thing I know, she insisted on me still paying the fee. After a few exchanged emails pleading with her to let this go as a warning and asking her to place herself in my shoes... still no dice.

Now we called to the front office acting as someone else saying that our brother was coming into town and had his dog with them

Exactly after that and coincidently enough

So THEN

Granted they do have a blanket statement in the lease saying *""Resident acknowledges that animal sitting &amp; visiting on the premises and unit for any amount of time are prohibited""* but EVERYONE we've talked to living here was asked questions or received warnings and EVERYONE else working the apartment is green lighting the situation. I feel as if we're being victimized because some jerk roommate skipped town on them and she is trying to recoup on her rent loss. 

Now I'm contemplating getting an attorney, and the Austin Tenant's Council involved with hopes of striking down this charge.

Are there any lawyers or someone that has any wherewithal on a situation like this that knows if I have a ground to stand on??? This is absolutely unfair that I'm getting charged $400 that I can't afford because I was being a good friend and letting someone sleep rather driving an additional hour half asleep behind the wheel. The dog wasn't on the premises any longer than 10 hours.

Then a year ago, in a panic to stop whatever was going on. It was strange, though, because it was like I was outside of myself, just running on basic instinct. Like the scream had triggered something inside me. It ended up being a woman behind my house who had been walking home from the bars when a man grabbed her and pulled a knife on her. She was able to pull his hand away from her mouth and start screaming and neighbors came to her rescue.

But the instant I was pulled out of sleep by that scream I was immediately back to the crime scene from my childhood. It was the same scream, raw scream that can't be faked or acted. Somehow, waking up to that seemed to reawaken the event I went through ten years earlier. I felt incredibly shaken up, but also mad at myself for feeling so shaken up - nothing happened to *me* directly, I wasn't a victim. What right do I have to feel upset? 

Flash forward to a month after the incident with the woman, people drinking. Suddenly, that scream - that same scream, something-is-wrong scream. My body went ice cold. Before I even knew what had happened, I knew something was wrong. I gathered the kids around me and told them to sit quietly while I went into the other room. Whatever had happened, I didn't want them to witness it. One of the men had collapsed and was seizing, then went catatonic, non-responsive. He later recovered

It's been nearly a year and I still freeze up now whenever I hear human shouts. For example, my stomach dropped and my body froze. I get filled with terror and can't shake it for up to an hour after. Sometimes, especially at night, I feel wound up as if I'm on the defensive, every nerve finely tuned and waiting for something to spring out at me, for a scream to pierce the night, for someone to get hurt or be in danger.

How can I go back to being my old, but it doesn't seem to be doing that.

I recently discovered that my boss, manipulating and back-stabbing me for years now.   And, to top it off, one of my best “friends”, who is a co-worker, has been in cahoots with him!  I am heart-broken, so ANGRY I am scaring myself

Backstory:  I am a manager and have worked there for 15+ years.  It’s a very good job with retirement, I know it.  I thought he and I had a very good relationship - we laugh, talk, work well together, etc.  But, when he first became my boss, he made a mistake that embarrassed him with the higher-ups (because he didn’t listen to my advice!) and used that as an excuse to give some duties to my “friend” – I am technically her supervisor.  Over time

But, it was just his preference to give my duties to her!

He’s a well-thought of person, and obviously a glib liar.  He got away with it by insisting that I keep my mouth shut with the higher-ups and let him handle communications.  I can’t tell you how many times he’s raised my blood pressure, had me ranting and raving, my nerves shot, my esteem shot, telling me that, though he likes me very much and thinks I do wonderful work, depression

FOR YEARS now I have been asking myself why the higher-ups don’t like me, I trust(ed) people and now I feel like I cannot trust the majority of people.

To top it all off

To top it off even MORE, ultimately, I am responsible for the accounts and I’d be damned if they’d pin it on me!  The higher-ups have been very kind to me, signed off on my sick leave, are working to sort this all out, are happy to give me good references, etc.  But, having had his hands slapped.  If I get a new boss

So, just in case he sticks around, but, damn, there aren’t many jobs that pay well and have good benefits like this one.

But how?  HOW do I let go of this anger, this betrayal?  It is eating me up.  Whenever I think about it I start with the panic attacks, so, I try NOT to think about it.  But, I’ve got to come to grips with it at some point and go on.   I just don’t understand conniving, manipulative people like this – I would NEVER do something like this to anyone!  I like people.  I am kind to people.  I am well-liked.  I don’t deserve this!  And STUPID.  I feel SO STUPID having been so thoroughly duped.

**Year 1**
Nothing involving staff until the end of my lease.  When staff came in to clean the apartment for a resident that was moving into a bedroom, and used my personal cooking supplies to clean between small crevices.  They barely acknowledged my complaint, and I wasn't reimbursed for lost property.  

I found a used match on my bed and my bedroom's deadbolt to be very loose after a health/safety inspection.  I don't smoke or own matches

I asked to be moved to a different on-campus location for the following year

**Year 2**
The folks above me were very loud.  They'd keep me up and wake me up because of their music no matter the time or day of the week.  It got to the point that I would hear things in my ceiling vibrating (pipes, but never fixed it.  

I was once asked to leave my apartment by the other tenant because he was having a party and I needed to study.  Staff addressed it

I spent 2/7 nights a week here because of the noise.  I could not sleep or study here without being interrupted on a consisten basis.

I ended up having to move to get away from the noise near the end of my lease.

**Year 3**
It was fine until the tenant below me started pumping her music.  It would wake me up and keep me up at all hours of the day.  I could sing to it at times because it was loud enough to hear the lyrics.  Staff addressed it

The complex director ended up coming over and setting a maximum volume for her, that didn't work.  I was told ""It wasn't a rule, just a suggestion.  I won't enforce it.""

If I called the office, and then tell me ""I can't hear anything.""  They started listening in my room then.  Even if it was above the ""maximum volume,"" they wouldn't do anything.

I spent 2/7 nights a week here because of the noise.  I could not sleep or study here without being interrupted on a consisten basis.


My boss required me to go to counseling because of the stress I was under due to these events.  He knew about it all and tried to help me

1370416581.0,1fpij9,Stepdad is dying and no one told me (pretty sure on purpose); stepfamily has been holding my mom's damage against me since I was 9 despite the fact she was abusive to my family.,flutterkitty,14,4,3,"A bit of background:

I was adopted by my mom and dad. Parents divorced when I was six

Mom abused my younger brother and I as we were growing up, and emotionally abusive to me while dismissive and physically abusive with my younger brother. My stepdad was treated like a punching-bag-meets-ATM for almost ten years before they divorced. Mom claimed she had DID and borderline personality and bailed out of state before the divorce proceedings could begin to follow her new female therapist across the country in an enmeshed relationship (my mother refers to her therapist as her mother). 

As we grew up, who were trying our best to be teenagers in an extremely unhealthy environment where we were pawns to our mother's rage), would send off nasty emails detailing just how horrible his life was, how awful his kids were, how he absolutely hated us and that we were simply reflections off of the facets of my broken mother. My mom had installed tracking software on his computer to capture every keystroke. Whenever my stepdad spoke ill of us (in particular, me) my mother would call us in to the bedroom and read the emails to us as we looked over her shoulder to see who the email went to and when. 

My stepdad was the parent left in charge after my mother took off. I was 20, and stayed out after my mother and I had a huge fight in the spring of my freshman year at college. I attempted suicide a number of times before I was able to seek professional help and began to understand that my mother was an abuser. My brother got caught up in hard drugs and alcohol at age 15 and hasn't stopped since. I was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD, one year after another. When I was raped, it was my stepdad I went to in order to ask for help. I still haven't told my mother. That's the last thing I need. His idea of helping me was paying for three sessions of therapy and then insulting and harassing the therapist to the point where she was about to call the police to put a restraining order on him. She had the evidence necessary to do so. When I asked him why he was acting so inappropriately, he cut off all contact with me and told me never to ask him for anything again. I haven't spoken to him in over a year.

I recently found out my stepdad was dying...two weeks after he was put in the hospital. He has cancer all over his body; it has metastasized into his lymph nodes, and pneumonia as the icing on the shitcake. No one was going to tell me, until my younger brother called my stepdad to see how he was doing (he likes to randomly contact people like that). He called me as soon as he found out. When I confronted my stepbrother on the issue, he said that no one was going to tell me because they ""didn't want me to freak out.""

I, years of public disgrace in emails to the extended stepfamily takes its toll on my ability to trust my stepdad for anything he said. But a part of me has always cared. I've always known that he had serious baggage that would permanently effect the way he interacted with me and my younger brother, let alone everyone else (believe me, people know he's a fair bit of crazy too). 

I feel that not telling me that my stepdad is dying because they ""didn't want to freak me out"" is absolute bullshit. I am deeply offended and hurt that I wasn't contacted as an immediate family member after everything we had all been through. I'm one of the last to know. My stepbrother has moved into my childhood home which is currently operating as a waystation for all of the other family members who are coming into town to see him. My stepbrother is treating me as if I'm an inconvenience. I know that the family that's in town doesn't want anything to do with me because all they see is the nine-year-old girl caught up in her psychotic mother's schemes. 

I'm going to see my stepdad in the hospital, has been there damn near non-stop. I didn't even know he was in town until my younger brother called to tell me. A part of me is hoping that the stepfamily will see past the bullshit and respect me as a part of the family, but the larger part of me knows they won't. 

How do I handle this? Do I confront my stepbrother on the ""not freaking me out"" bullshit excuse? Do I tell my stepdad that I know what he went through with my mother's abuse (we haven't talked about it yet)? Do I try to establish an identity and relationship with the stepfamily as an independent person from my mother

This hurts pretty fucking badly. I've cried every night since I heard the news and spoke ever-briefly with my stepbrother

I am chair of a council of student-elected representatives. A number of the reps have been useless. Utterly useless. I've spent a lot of time picking up the slack. Unfortunately, I am essentially having to take it all on board.

I have spent this past year working my ass of trying to make things better for students. I've organised events, answered COUNTLESS emails. I've also been pretty unwell- I have had the flu three times (I think partially due to stress fucking up my immune system) and I also had an emergency operation a few months ago. Add to this I have suffered a string of bereavements- 4 in 10 days, really I shit you not- and when I went home to deal with these bereavements, I was still having to have telephone meetings to pick up the slack of other reps.

Please bear in mind I am not paid for this. I get a very small meal allowance

So, but I've always disliked her and slightly feared her mostly from a distance. In person it's been mostly civil, though I hate getting emails from her. My mum had suggested that I should try to communicate in person as her emails are so off, but as I found out this week that isn't going to work either.

After discovering something she had done that she doesn't have the power to do (changing the council's constitution), we would have to discuss it at a meeting and that it can't be ratified without us voting on it. She proceeded to rip me to shreds. She didn't shout- she's not that person. She smiled as she undermined everything I have busted my gut to do. 8 hours spent at a desk not eating lunch while I write a proposal for an event. The countless days where I've been unable to do my own studying. The nights I've spent washing and cleaning student spaces. She told me I had done nothing and basically a bunch of other stuff too. I have never been spoken to like that. I was hugely distressed. I was in tears as soon as I left. 'Crying my eyes out' would be an appropriate description (seriously, my eyes hurt so much I had to take my contacts out!!!!)

An hour later, in front of a lot of the university's governors, she gave me this weird half-hug and gave a bizarre, half-apology. I don't know how genuine it was. It seemed very forced, but at the same time if she really was sorry I don't want to discount that.

My problem is that I am now left with a huge amount of negative feeling. I have this ball of hate in the it of my stomach. I feel completely used and I am so angry at myself for...running in the first place. Jeopardising my degree. Wasting my time. I keep beating myself up for not doing a good job

1366798771.0,1d02ap,Motivation and of the Lack of Direction,NeedMotivation2,16,5,13,"**Warning: wall-of-text**

I'm not really sure where to begin

Over the past few years I've grown more and more apathetic towards, if I have no tangible motivation, or anything else. Things have just sort of spiraled over the last few months.

I get literally zero exercise (read: sitting at the computer from wake until sleep, I go about my day tired, and I go to bed tired. It could be sleep apnea, it could be depression, it could be apathy, being overweight/out-of-shape..

My sleep schedule is also all kinds of fucked up. On average I'll sleep from 6AM to 5PM (when my mother gets home). I'll get on a normal schedule for a day or two when I have to work the weekend, and being awake at night. It's been like this for years, even during college, where I'd be awake at night, get a few hours of sleep before class (or none at all), then more sleep later. Even when some commitments force me to be awake during the day, I still end up reverting back to ""nocturnal mode.""

I feel like I'm the laziest piece of shit alive, and I'm also developing an indie game with a friend, which is also enjoyable. The problem is that I can't even bring myself to do these things, the things I ENJOY! I just don't have the energy or motivation; something is clearly wrong here.

I'm determined not to get sucked into a 9-5 job I probably won't even enjoy, both of which I feel are paramount to my happiness, and ultimately, personal success. To top it all off, student loans are looming, and I'll be paying them in a few short months.

I have a part-time job and I've saved a few thousand dollars to give myself a bit of time before my loans come due, or what to do with it, and that scares me.

Important things worth mentioning:

* I *don't* want to work for someone else for the rest of my life (or even for the foreseeable future!).
* I *want* to lose weight.
* I *want* to find motivation. I *need* to find it.

Even though these things are all important to me, but I feel like I just don't have the energy or the drive to achieve it.

I'm disappointed in myself. I know how bad it is to live like this, and the fact that I know that, in my current state of living, I have no reasonable expectations of achieving the goals I've currently set for myself. I hate that so many others have found the motivation to work on their projects, but I can't be bothered to do anything other than Reddit or play video games for most of the day after waking up after sleeping 12 hours, feeling tired and apathetic, unwilling to do the things I *know* will help me change my life.

What the hell do I do? How can I turn my life around?

**Edit:** A bit of extra back story here - I'm also a massive procrastinator, which isn't terrible, but also nothing to write home about. At the end, I just wanted to graduate to graduate, not because it would help me better myself and increase my job prospects..

She has already claimed my father raped her when she was a child. (This is a complete lie and she wrote it all over Facebook, she kept believing she was, so DNA tests would be useless.)

[This](http://imgur.com/a/eMvRI#0) is the last conversation I had with her. Maybe I didn't handle it the best way but she constantly borrows money from me and doesn't pay me back. I was getting fed up with it. She even mentions ""my son"" even though we don't know the sex of the baby yet. I'm worried she will say something worse.

1362295393.0,19kfwd,How to deal with an annoying small group situation in a college class. (a bit ranty),LouMcGopher,13,1,6,"For some background: This is my third year in college

The class is an ethics class, and individual assignments. There is one aspect of the class I dread every time I go: my small discussion group. These groups were assigned to us by our professor based on our ""similar interests."" I think he grouped us together because we're all psychology majors. As far as I know, they are permanent for the rest of the semester.

There is one girl in my group that I quite simply cannot stand. At first I respected her because she is intelligent, but once I got to know her she started getting on my nerves. She is a very militant antitheist and quite far-left in her politics. I am a recent convert to Catholicism and at a bit of a political impasse (I voted libertarian in the last election, but I've started considering distributism). Normally I do not have a problem with people whose views are different from my own, in fact, I learn a lot from them and they sometimes even change my mind. Three of my closest friends are atheists and many of the people in my social circle at least lean left politically, and as I said before, part of the reason I transferred is I wanted to learn alongside people who have different views. 

But this girl is almost evangelical about her beliefs. She tries to insert them into every discussion we have, characters, and problem (e.g., the [trolley problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)) and all she wanted to talk about were overpopulation and environmentalism. She constantly interrupted other members of the group and talked over the professor when he was explaining the assignment, and did not stop when he reprimanded her. We did not end up completing the assignment because she kept derailing the discussion and diverting the group's attention away from what we were supposed to be doing. 

She thinks all theists are idiots and completely rejects everything they have to say. She thought Kant was a moron because he quoted Scripture in his essays, I really do, but she is not interested in dialogue or debate; only in proclaiming her beliefs and shooting down everyone who disagrees. Her attitude is just arrogant and disrespectful all around; she usually comes to class 20 minutes late, if she shows up at all, and is rude to the professor and the other students.

I'm not exactly sure how to deal with this situation.

1360114399.0,17yywh,I've had a bad weekend,TS2862,14,2,3,"This is a throwaway.  
  
The first of my two events this weekend involves my girlfriend of about a year. Our relationship has been deteriorating for quite some time and I have made the decision to leave her and such I am not asking for relationship advice. I was her first in bed and first she ever fell in love with. However as the honeymoon phase passed fighting grew more and more frequent and she has devolved into pure emotional manipulation of me while still trying to tell me she loves me. Regardless of that this saturday after a large fight she was convinced I was breaking up with her (I was the next day but had not told anyone). After a few hours of not hearing from her I get a text from her roommate at college that she was talking about suicide. I go to her and after talking she bounces back to a somewhat normal mood. I keep her with me for the rest of the weekend to watch her while helping host the superbowl party my household was throwing. I have no idea how to get her the help she needs (as her family is...not the most supportive). She is dragging me down, and I fear that any attempt of me to leave her without first getting her help will result in her hurting herself. I understand that some talk of suicide can be a cry for help kind of thing but given her mental health history I feel that it would irresponsible of me to leave her given what I have told you so far.
  
A few hours after dropping her back off at her college I come home to face a completely separate issue. I am now in my mid twenties and there has always been a point of contention between my father and I concerning his drinking (and smoking) to the point where we have had several mild (never came to blows) arguments regarding these habits over the course of my life. I have lived in close proximity to him (close enough to see him on a regular basis) for 5 of the last 6 years. He has always had a drinking problem and been depressed. For many of those years he has either done a good job at hiding it from me or recently it has gotten much worse. Regardless the night of the superbowl I was outside talking to his not-quite-girlfriend but not-quite-fiance about my dad's drinking as he had gotten a bit rowdy that night.  
  
Among other things I was told a story from the christmas a bit over a month prior. Dad had a few beers (and something else) on a night himself and the not-quite-fiance (NQF from here out) attended a christmas party about 15 miles away from here. After the party my father was slurring his speech a bit. Nothing too bad from what I hear, trying to get a response despite him being conscious and trying to get him to pull over. He comes to himself, pulls over in a huff and gets out of the car angrily. Of course he is too drunk to stand up and falls into the rightmost lane of traffic. NQF and friends drag him into the passenger seat and she takes a risk and drops off the friends and drives home. From what I have been told by NQF this kind of heavy drinking has been growing more frequent in the year and a half they have been together.  
  
The christmas party story does not end here however. Upon getting home NQF goes inside, hits the hood of the car cracking two ribs and then gets a concussion as he hits the grounds. As the story was told the only thing stopping NQF from getting an ambulance out there was when she came outside with the house phone it was two far from the base and had no signal. My father came to before she was able to get back inside.  
  
Before I continue the rest of events I want to give a picture of what my father is like on a night of normal drinking. He either becomes argumentative and easily angered or severely depressed. Until yesterday I thought that the worst this anger was manifested was a few shouted words and then the rest of the night sulking over what he did.  
  
That night after talking with NQF about Dad's drinking we agreed something had to be done or we would leave before he could drag us down. I went to bed, still friends) about my father. She recently heard from a friend of my dad's how they were out one night and he was drinking. The night ended in what was arguably sexual assault. This apparently happened a year or two ago but my mom had only heard about it the day before she called me. She also told me of another event. When my mom, my mom's 2 best friends (1 male 1 female) and my father were visiting me back out east a few years back my father pulled a similar stunt. After I flew out to where I was going next they all went out together. My father had a few drinks, then a few more, continued this pattern for awhile and attacked my mom's female friend. Both this attack and the borderline sexual attacks are hard for me to describe. I have few details but both times my father was drunk to the point where he was so uncoordinated he intent was not clear, but the force behind it was. My mom's male friend stayed in the room with my mom and the female friend that night as my father pounded on the door yelling at them to let him in for a few hours.  
  
I want to say about these two events that I am not sure why police were not called for each. I love my dad but if he pulled any shit like that while I was around I would do whatever I needed to in order to stop him hurting anyone around him. I want to think that these events are isolated but from what I have heard and seen I cannot ignore the possibility that this could happen to NQF. She is a wonderful woman and strong-willed. I personally cannot see her having stuck around if anything of this sort happened.  
  
Next thing I want to talk about is my father's health. He is overweight but not obese, and there is nothing more he loves in the world, myself included.  
  
I have a half-baked plan about getting his family out here to have an intervention and get him into rehab or something that can help
  
The only steps I have taken to solve either problem at present has been to attend a Narcotics Anonymous meeting yesterday in order to better understand, especially since if this goes wrong I need to move myself and NQF and quickly.  
  
I am running on caffeine and nicotine at this point. Despite being tired I know I have the willpower to do what needs to be done

My company is a startup that's about 3 years old. They've been very successful, however it's been difficult because we only have the tech side following this, not the business side. I've asked time and time again if we can get the business side trained and have been shot down. I do my best to explain to them how the process works and why their requests are backlogged, but without everyone being on board with agile I suppose I just come off as a dick.

Some things in my review make sense. Because until literally last month I've been the only PM, I'm giving about only 80% of the attention to each that they deserve. In my review they highlighted that they'd rather see me give 100% attention to as many as I can with one or two sliding, then give the partial attention I have.

I immediately suggested if, so I sent my first email out right after. No response yet.

The thing that really blindsided me in my review was a comment on my attitude, and being short. And apparently a large number of people felt this way. I've tried to take as objective a look as I can on my behavior and I have zero idea on how I've come off this way, the only thing I can pinpoint is my desperate attempts to explain to customers (internal, we don't have clients) why their things haven't been worked on and what the delays are. I can only guess that I sounded negative since I was being perceived as taking this as a failure on my part to keep this moving (as opposed to it being a failure within the process).

Anyways, that I do so in person, with a smile on my face, and I say ""these are great observations"" and ""thank you for taking the time to walk me through this"" and ""let me see where this can fit in the backlog and I'll have you an update either today or tomorrow morning"" with an email acknowledgement after that has a time stamp for the conversation. Whenever I go through issues with customers, I ask a lot of questions about how often they use a particular feature or what their current process is. I do this in order to better understand how important this feature is for release and if it should be bumped up... maybe I sound like I don't believe them? Like I'm asking ""ha! You think you need this? Prove it, punk!""

Sorry for the wall of text. I've never gotten a bad review before

Since people often ask ""what's your Plan B?"" in a crisis

Plan A: Work to visibly and objectively improve the pain points in my bad performance review before my second review in 30 days is up

Plan B (concurrent with Plan A): Dust off my resume, get in touch with recruiters again, and do a passive job hunt to understand the current market in case I do get fired.

Plan C: Investigate going back to school again (I currently only have a Bachelor's, nothing to do with my degree, I'm sure that's hurting me in the eyes of the execs)

Plan D: Pick up more freelance work (I have an art/design hobby) to tide me over.

However, and lo and behold, it did. A month ago she was drinking and cutting, cut extremely deep, and needed to go to the emergency room for stitches. We don't believe she was trying to commit suicide, just that it was a drunken accident. That experience affected me and my other roommates profoundly, and we've done nothing but worry about her since then.

After coming back from the hospital the second time, seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist once a week, and also going to a weekly group therapy for BPD. She says that whenever she gets the urge to self-harm she occupies herself with a project like cleaning the house or something of that nature. However, we don't know how long that's going to last. My roommates and I go to school during the day and fulfill our other obligations, but she's taking the semester off and works the graveyard shift at a pizza place, so she's alone in our house most of the day. We can't supervise her and make sure she's doing the things she needs to be doing, we think she needs more help than what she is currently receiving

As a result, and doesn't think going to a more intensive treatment program will cure her any more than what she's doing now. However, what she's doing now is entirely on her own accord. Just as easily as she's decided to take her meds, say sober, and go to therapy, she can stop doing those things, and no one will be around to know. She admits that when she gets stressed she doesn't want to be sober, which does not create a supportive environment for someone who needs to be sober.

After the second hospitalization her parents visited for the weekend, but believes that my roommate is an adult who can make her own decisions and we can't force her into doing anything she doesn't want to do.  She believes she is powerless and refuses to step in, despite our pleas for her to do so. While it's true that our friend can make her own decisions, history has proven that she cannot be trusted to make safe and responsible ones at this time.

My roommates and I are stuck. As peers, won't. We are trying to contact her therapist, but because of privacy laws we would only be able to talk ""at"" her and share our perspective on the situation, and we don't know what effect that will have given her parents' inability to take action. For the time being, as long as she lives here we will continue to feel responsible for her, and that responsibility is something we can no longer bear.

What is it you end up not doing so you can fit in 8 hours of sleep a day? I cant seem to figure out what homework to put on the side and just deal with getting an F even though I want to get good grades.  
  
  
Also I would like to be more productive with my work (get it done in a faster more timely manner and find a way to actually do all of it.) I am not suffering from senioritis
  
  
What do you do to stay motivated, and chores? How do you decide what tasks you should and shouldn't do to keep this balance and find a core of tasks that are high priority?
  
  
Also I would like to note that getting the good grades and having a sleep schedule has gotten extremely hard after I have had a class III concussion. I was doing OK before
  
  
**tl;dr:**
How do you keep a sleep schedule?
What tasks do you give up keep this schedule?
How did you prioritize these tasks?
How do you keep a balance of you work

I'm 26. I was raised by a single parent with NPD, extremely controlling, demanded inappropriate levels of intimacy, believed that constant criticism was the best way to motivate me, etc. etc. etc. 

I found out about 6 months ago that I have ADHD and have in fact had it all my life (was able to get childhood test results that my mother ignored). My ADHD symptoms in particular were something my mother would attack me for. I'm on medication that works wonders and has made me realize how unfair she was and it is stirring up old feelings of grief and anger.

I do see a psychiatrist but he only treats me for ADHD/social anxiety and simply doesn't have the time to offer talk therapy (his services are free).  I can't afford to pay for talk therapy sessions (average rate in my city starts at $100/hour). I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for books/workbooks/websites they think might be helpful for me

I like talking about where we're heading in life and topics along that line rather than last night's sports game. Maybe I'm a downer?

I was just thinking about this last night.  My gf brought me out to a party, being a wall flower.  I talked to some people casually about their recent travels, but after a few minutes I can tell these people want to get out of our conversation right away. I have a hard time making people laugh.  How do you guys do it?  Sometimes my jokes will just go over their heads and one or two will get it.  I just feel ignored and unwanted, but I want to make myself known.

Then I'm also worried about being too boring for my gf.  She admits that she's a boring person as well and not as social, and I spilled these insecurities, telling her that I can be clingy but I'm trying not to be and want to give her her space.  She doesn't tell me what I need to do or what I should do, but just says that it seems like if she wasn't at the party that I wouldn't have had a good time at all.  Well, maybe I should try to be better friends with her friends, which brings this back to my original paragraph.

How do I get these people interested in me? How do I get them to want to invite me out? I hung out with them once without my gf around and it seemed like every 5 minutes they were asking me where she was.  That was it for our conversation. I at least sit in their conversations and smile

He's pretty self sufficient in physical terms. What I'm trying to cope with is the stress he tends to cause.

If you haven't cared for someone with a mental illness you'll probably think I'm awful or something. It's a really stressful job. They do a lot of things that don't conform with the normal rules of society and that quickly gets on your nerves. I know it's not his fault and I don't blame him

He does a lot of stuff. Most of it doesn't bother me. Like when he pees on the bathroom floor all the time, turns off the kitchen while I'm cooking or the washing machine while I'm washing some clothes, etc. Meh, it's no big deal. But what really gets me is how often he comes looking for me for no reason at all. It seems to come in bursts. Probably related to anxiety. But when he gets into it, he comes to my room every 5 minutes to ""see if I'm there"". This doesn't seem like a big deal but when you start counting the times it happens into the 3 digits, you start losing it XD

Sometimes he will actually go open the bathroom door while I'm taking a dump more than 6 times to see where I am. I can't ignore him. He just keeps on knocking. He's come to check on me twice while I've been typing this. No reason at all.

However, he has not answered my e-mails, has no phone number listed, and when I call to ask to talk to him, they say to e-mail first. 

ALSO, they got my transcripts, I talked to the academic advising. However, I still had my Bacterial Meningitis hold on my account, despite having sent them the paper. I called to ask what the hold up was, and they said it would be sorted before it was time for class to start. I called 3 separate times and was told the same thing each time. Low and behold, Friday before registration closes, which was after I had started work. I told them I would send it in as soon as I got home (11pm) and they told me this was fine

 Well, and Monday (the day registration closed) was Memorial Day, so all the offices at the college were closed.

Now I have to go ANOTHER semester without attending college, will be pulling the little support the provide.

I am in my second semester of college and I am about to move into my dorm today. The reason I chose this university was mainly because my dad passed away while I was in the application process and I wanted to stay close to my mom for emotional support. Plus, and I always told myself I’d never base my decision off of somebody else (ie. Mom, boyfriend…) but given the situation it seemed worth to be here for my mom during this time.


So during my first semester I decided to make the 45-minute commute to my university. All was well except the drive was rather tiring and I would end up alone most of the time I was home since my mom works night shifts at the hospital and sleeps during the day. For the most part, she calls me incessantly while I am on campus and if I am not home by 6pm she freaks out. (My latest class ended at 4:30pm last semester so it's hard. Especially during traffic rush hour) I appreciate that she cares, I really do, but I’m 19 now and I also wish she’d loosen the leash a little. I’ve given her no reason not to trust me, but she always pulls the ""You live under my roof, you do as I say"" card.


My decision to live on campus this semester was hard because I know my mom will now be living alone. She doesn’t get out much outside of work or have many friends, but she just seems so sad about it and guilt trips me on occasion. 


I feel like a spoiled brat that this is bothering me so much. Woe is me for being able to further my education in exchange for a little extra driving

On the other hand, and I really care about my family. That’s more than a lot of people can say, I suppose.

Basically, so if I don't clean up after him we'd be regularly failing those.

A few weeks ago we agreed to split the cost of a small TV. I have an Xbox that I said he could use, so he doesn't watch it, just plays the Xbox. Well, he was constantly leaving the Xbox on all night, turning it on and then never touching it, taking discs out and just throwing them down on the table, and basically treating it all with disrespect. I nicely asked him to be a little more careful several times

So finally yesterday after yet another time finding it just left running without him anywhere near it, begins throwing shit around, making all kinds of noise, slamming stuff, etc. I pretended to just be asleep because I really didn't feel like confronting him in that state.

Come this morning, lots of my food was either eaten or thrown away, and the power cable to the TV that we equally paid for is missing.

At this point I'm not really sure what to do. Part of me wants to be blatantly rude like him and throw on all the lights and wake him up, all I want to do is avoid conflict and protect my stuff, but he doesn't seem capable of that.

Quick background.. I started dating a girl (lets call her roxane) in 10th grade (we were both 15 at the time.)  The relationship went very well for a couple years, and finally fizzled at the end of our sophomore year in college.

Since the breakup, and focused on school work.  For the first time in my life, I was attractive and interesting, and girls noticed.  I slummed it for a while and probably stuck myself into more girls than I care to admit. (A big difference from 4 years of complete loyalty.)

Now I'm entering my senior year in college, I have good friends, and my career is going very well.  Honestly, I had myself thinking I was fine until last month.

It all came to me when I was riding my 'new' vintage bike to campus, even have the personality she used to love.

I just realize now that having invested emotionally and sentimentally in such a nut case has fucked up my sentimental life. Here are the main characteristics of the relationship I could remember:

* She was unstable

* She had deep depression and eating disorders (she always avoided to have dinner or lunch with me).

* She was sometime seemingly loving but subtly conveying that I was not perfect or good enough for her

* She was intellectually devaluing. She belonged to a religious sect and always made me feel like I was missing something by not being part of it (this fucked up my successive relationship with a mildly catholic girl because I became very scared of religious people in general). I now realize how manipulative this was.

* She was escalating physically only to block just before intercourse

This has created a lot of roadblocks for me to get into a new relationship. From the cognitive point of view

I am actually un-learning some cognitive distortion I have learnt in the past; although the fear remains (especially when meeting new girls who present a spiritual side). By the way

Anyways, and her joints locking. Other times she displays some symptoms in the positive spectrum, delusions of grandeur, hearing voices, etc. Obviously I learned quite a bit about the disease through a psychology course that I took, as well as a research paper and speech I had to perform for a class and I decided to do that on schizophrenia. 

I would like to go into the ways that this affected me growing up but I don’t feel that it’s really relevant to the questions I’m about to ask so perhaps that will be another post if there is interest. 

What I’m here to talk about today is the fact that she was fine up until a few years ago after I left home and went to Florida to start my own life. It wasn’t readily apparent that there was anything wrong; she just all of a sudden stopped taking her medicine about a year or so after I left. She had a psychotic break and no one really knows what it was over or about. All we know is that my Dad walked in on her while her joints were locked up and she was rocking back and forth

I believe specifically after this incident and after she was released from a mental health facility the doctors put her on a drug that is not effective for her in the slightest. My dad knew this as well as her sister and they attempted to take her to a doctor to get it changed and apparently my mother tried to jump out of the car so she wouldn’t have to go back. They then took her to another mental health facility and they sort of straightened her out. Unfortunately she has stopped taking her meds again and I don’t really know what to do.  I came back to South Carolina partly because my father could no longer deal with this on his own and the fact that there were just no jobs in Florida at the time and we had to let the apartment go and my girlfriend is staying with some family while we’re trying to get back on our feet (The reason why this wasn't even a consideration for me is because quite frankly

So, abuse, and has also told him that they are no longer married because their marriage was never “real”. She keeps telling me that he is not my father, that I am not his son, and that my real father is a good, kind, and caring man. She has attempted to get me to not eat because Satan had apparently infected the food. She goes through these phases where she is in “testing” which is apparently a Christian thing where she has to do whatever God tells her, and there was even a scare about a gun before I was able to sneak into her room and take all of the ammunition that belongs in the gun cabinet. She still has a gun hidden somewhere- but all of the ammunition is accounted for and the weapon was not loaded. 

The reason why I wrote all of this is because I think I’ve become…. accustomed to some of her erratic behavior to the point where it’s somewhat normal instead of shocking. The police I mentioned before said that she seemed very out of touch with reality and needed to see a doctor ASAP. That was a few weeks ago and she did indeed go see her doctor, what can we do? I played with the idea of taking her back to Florida with me but both my girlfriend and myself are Pagans and my mother is very devout Christian who had a hissy fit when she found out I’d read Harry Potter. 

We will be decorating our house with a lot of Pagan symbolism and we will also participate in our respective religions and I’m not willing to change this for my mother

I obviously can’t stay here the rest of my life- I will not. My father would be willing to let shit go if she starts treating him like a human being but that’s not going to happen. She cannot stay by herself so I’m starting to think that maybe she really needs to be in an institution if she can’t manage her diseases.

What do you guys think? What can be done? What should be done?

1301149033.0,gbxze,Is it too late to change the trajectory of my life?,midlifecrisis55,12,2,13,"TL;DR -- 33 year old lawyer hates his job

I'm sorry to spill my guts like this

Let me start with a quick life bio:

I am 33 years old. I graduated with a degree in business in 2002

I hate every minute of it. The people I deal with are some of the worst people I've ever met -- and then there are the clients (sorry, I honestly don't know why I went to law school. It just seemed like the kind of thing I should do. People told me I'd be good at it and I have a lot of lawyers in my family, so I just made the easy decision I guess.

I have thought for a long time I want to quit and do something else, do I want to do? The things I enjoy no one will pay me to do...and a lot of the time I just think everyone hates their job, that's the reality of being an adult. Maybe I need to man up and just do the grind. Money is not my primary motivation -- I can be perfectly happy earning 30k a year.

Not to brag on myself, I'm organized and reasonably intelligent. I'm also lazy, procrastinate, and don't work very well in a group. In school I excelled in basically every subject and I took classes in virtually everything (I had like 180 hours when I finished, I took 21-24 hours a semester and went to summer school). TBH I like everything on an academic level, but I'm less sure what I like on a professional level.

Pros:
- I have no debt. I was on full scholarship for most of law/undergrad and paid off the rest. However
- I have no permanent ties that hold me where I live now. My GF supports this (and in fact has begged me to quit for years
- I dug out my old transcripts. This is what I have: I have a GRE score from 01-2004 where I made a 720, magna cum laude.  All from top 15 schools.
- Assuming my tests are still valid
- Financially it would be a sacrifice, it would probably seriously set me back if I dropped it for 2+ years then tried to come back.

Cons:
- I'm old. This whole mess reeks of a stereotypical midlife crisis. Could this all just be a general discontent with my life?
- I'm not sure things will be better even if I did do something else. My experience in the world of finance was basically the same as law -- both are nasty
- And here's the biggy...I don't really know what I want to do
- Jobs are hard to come by...what if I invest 2+ years tossing my law career out the window and end up another unemployed history major? To be blunt

So here are my questions for you

1.  Do you think this is just an irrational midlife crisis by a washed up lawyer?

2.  If not

3.  What can I do to prepare for going back to school

4.  Has anyone experienced something similar to this? What did you do

1298292323.0,fpiuo,The bathrooms at work are really disgusting,grossbathrooms,17,7,24,"This is going to be long but it needs explaining. 

I'm using a throwaway because I don't want to get fired and coworkers know my account on here. 

**Some Set-Up**

I work in a factory setting that deals with important documents that could be used for identity theft. For this reason cellphones

There are a lot of people on my shift in the building I work. I'd guess somewhere around two hundred and it runs twenty four hours a day

**The Bathrooms**

The bathrooms at work are absolutely filthy. There is often poop on (not in) the toilets, toilet paper, and Mysterious Liquids. Toilet Paper is strewn about and there is water around and on the toilet, and on the stall walls. It looks almost like someone was cupping water from the toilet and splashing it about. More than once I have found a bloody tampon on the floor by the toilet. Not in the empty little boxes that is there for the purpose. 

**The Cause**

As I said there are a lot of people from all walks of life

The problem is that most of my building (I would safely say half of the people on any shift with people of all the other races making up the other half) consists of Africans. Not illegals

And it is this group that is mainly responsible for the disgusting bathrooms. A good chunk of them probably are not but a good majority is. Let me explain before anyone calls me racist. 

* They don't bathe often if at all. At least not properly. There is a strong smell of BO overlayed by a lot of cologne or perfume. 
* When they do bathe, have borne witness to some of them washing their feet, private areas, and hair in the sinks, water fountains, and toilets. 
* There is a section that employs exclusively Africans and they have a mass break an hour before everyone else. If you go into the bathrooms before their lunch
* They also do not seem to like washing their hands and as I've seen piles in the toilets without toilet paper

This is gross and a lot of my coworkers complain about it

I have talked with my Supervisor who used to run that aforementioned section and he agrees and sees the problem. However

There's no way to enforce complete cleanliness unless who had a guard who stood in every bathroom and made sure everyone cleaned up after themselves and didn't wash anything but their hands and occasionally face in the sink. I can't accuse people by name because often I don't bother remembering the person as I'm trying to block out the vision before me and figure out the closest and cleanest bathroom. 

I can't have cameras or videotape to record it for proof and none of my coworkers will speak up because they're scared they will get fired. 

I'm at a loss

I need this job and other than that it is a really great place to work.

1290983156.0,ed0kv,25 year old virgin seeking advice,onideus01,16,5,14,"Ok, since the community that I've witnessed over the past few months seems very friendly and helpful.

My story is as follows:

During my teenage years I was popular (or popular enough) in high school, but I would always decline moving on to that last step. I didn't want to lose my virginity before I was married because that was a very important religious edict that my parents had tried to instill in me. However, as I've grown older, I now realize that it doesn't matter nearly as much as I thought it did. Unfortunately, it seems as though I'm out of my league now.

I'm 25, and after five surgeries over the past six years as well as spending nearly 14 months in a hospital room during this time for recovery or surgery preparation, I no longer know how to function in society. I feel at a loss. I suppose it would be something akin to someone who is in prison and then released. I only know how to function inside of hospitals, and find everything else confusing. I had to adapt my lifestyle, and now that I no longer am having issues with my disease (well, not horrible issues, anyway)

My question for advice is to what I can do to help myself assimilate into society better? I've always been introverted in nature, and while there isn't a huge gap in age, it's enough that I feel like I can't relate anymore. I feel awkward and alone in this, though I know I'm not. I'm sure there are plenty of people that are in my exact position, so maybe I'm hoping to hear from them and see how they were able to cope or transition back into a regular life. Obviously I find it kind of difficult approaching girls in the environment I encounter them the most in (school), simply because I just ‘feel’ so much older than them, even if I’m not. There’s also a maturity gap that has arisen

I’m not looking to just jump into a relationship or gunning for losing my virginity. I still want to lose it in a controlled environment, but to no apparent avail. If I posted pictures on here to set the mind frame would that help? Please don’t suggest parties, things like that. It isn’t that I can’t handle that kind of environment, but I prefer something different instead.

1287152975.0,drn1b,Just had a baby GF very depressed / no coverage I NEED HELP,wornoutITguy,15,4,32,"Hey Reddit! I need some major help / advice.
Spare me the abortion
History
My girlfriend (not married mistake #1) and I recently had a baby (He’s 3 months old now). While she was pregnant she decided on not returning to work after our boy was born (probably a dumb idea looking back now). She wanted to stay home with him for a year or so to help with his development, all his clothes, all the rent, utilities ECT you name it I’m paying for it). When I return home from work (I work in IT making a pretty good salary) I’m there help take care of our son, cook dinner, wash bottles, do dishes, giving him bottles ect. Basically I’m doing all I possibly can when I get home. I have no social life now (I expected that)
To top all of this off our son is colicky so there are days when he’s very difficult to deal with. My girl friend has always been a high stress / high anxiety person. She’s never had a good coping mechanism to deal with problem. When our son is getting into a fit she quickly escalates and gets very anxious and stressed out. This causes her to get headaches (which she complains about all day) this makes her think unclearly which affects her energy levels and judgment. When our son is in a fit he needs constant attention and soothing. When she’s stressed that’s the last thing she wants to do so that further gets my son all worked up. So while I’m at work all I hear all day over text is how hard he’s being today and how she can’t take it anymore. When I return home I calmly rock my son to sleep within minutes and she gets angry at me for several reasons (if he sleeps too much during the day he will wake up at night, last night she stayed up till 3 am; I had our son sleeping in bed at 9:30 and he slept till 7 am this morning).

She’s been living with me since our son was born so that’s taking adjustment as well. A few weeks ago my friend and I moved all her remaining stuff into my apartment while she was at her Grandmas. She must have forgotten her diary was on the table in the living room. As my friend and I were bringing in stuff he noticed it (it was open to the last day she wrote it in just laying on our coffee table). He said what’s this and started reading the page aloud (it said some pretty hurtful things about me). After the move I decided to read the entire thing. She started writing in it soon after we got home from the hospital. For the most part it was all stuff she already told me (which I suspected so I never bothered to ever hunt her diary down because I didn’t really care) then I got to a passage that basically said she was going to leave me but was unable to because she found out she was pregnant. She also made mention that she’s unhappy with her life and I’m trying to control her (all I’m doing is giving her advice on things I think she needs to do). Such as finding a daycare center for our son (to give her a break during the day)

As the days go on we get into more and more arguments over things. Usually these arguments are related to trust issues she has with me. Somehow she things I’m cheating on her or I don’t like her (I’m at home with her and our son 24/7 or at work) I’ve never cheated on her but she treats me like I do. She treated me like this before she found out she was pregnant as well. Granted we get into fights often (nothing physical) but it’s because I love her and I’m concerned for her. Not a single week goes by that she doesn’t tell me she hates her life and she wishes she was dead (I don’t really think she would harm herself but I could be wrong).

So Reddit that’s my situation in a nutshell. I’m sure I’ve left things out but here are some questions I need help answering.
More info
1.	Right now she has no health coverage and I’m unable to put her on my plan until she’s living with me for 6 months.
2.	She’s very difficult to live with. She’s constantly (sad, overly emotional, worn out, thinks nobody likes her, refuses to socialize with people ect) take your pick
3.	We have no family living close by so having a mother or father come and help isn’t an option.
4.	She doesn’t want someone else (a baby sitter) watching our son.
My Options
1.	What can I do to get her help? I believe she needs to talk to a therapist or something. I’m not sure she has post partum depression. She probably does but she was depressed before our son was ever conceived. Even getting her to see one will be a problem because she believes it won’t help her. She also refuses to take medication because she’s afraid she will get addicted and it will change her.
2.	With her having no health coverage what are my options for help (she is applying for Medicaid today but I believe my salary disqualifiers her so we will see)? Do I just have to pay out of my own pocket now? I really want to keep my expenses in check. Right now I have my sights focused on saving up for a house for my son and hopefully (girlfriend to be married if things improve between us)
3.	Should I just tell her enough is enough you have to find a day care center and a job within (some time table) or I’m going to have to ask you to leave (she will likely have to fight for section 8 housing or live with her grandma since she has no income if it comes down to this; she does not like her Grandma). We will then possibly have a custody battle if I feel like going down that path or just submitting to joint custody and pay a huge amount of child support.
4.	Any other options I’ve overlooking?
Things that upset me about the situation
1.	I’m trying to do everything I can. I get her whatever she wants within reason (she was still hungry one time so I let her eat my T-bone steak as well (she had her own); she always demands the biggest piece of meat or most food. If she feels like she’s not getting the most she makes the entire day for me terrible)
2.	As a Dad my rights are shit on all over by the heavily biased court system. If I can prove she’s an unstable person
3.	I don’t really want to take my son away from her. I believe having a good mother and father is very important for a childs development. But I also don’t like the fact that she could get like 800 – 1000 dollars a month from me to sit around at her grandmas (when it certainly doesn’t cost that much to take care of a baby. I’ve only been spending around 200 a month for his food and clothes give or take. Taking care of my girlfriend actually costs more money then he does)
4.	She decided to keep the child with no consideration for my feelings on the situation. Personally I’m ready for the reasonability but back then I knew she was not (just like she’s proven). She doesn’t believe in abortion and I can respect that but she could have put him up for adoption.
5.	I really get the impression she doesn’t want to be with

I seem to always fall into my own traps. Every girl I've been with or interested in has either been a little weird

I realized, new hair, new activities, pretty much anything new and different. I also realized that for me to change, I need some time away from things that could deter me from that, i.e. trying to flirt with women, getting too lazy, which I'm expecting to work on all throughout this first semester of classes. I'm willing to deal with  if it means that I'll be more comfortable and confident about myself for the remainder of my life.

I've always been really skinny, and an introverted person. I want these to change. I am a hopeless romantic, who always ruins my chances with women by not knowing what the right thing to say is, smothering them, or creeping them out. Change, change, change.

I need to know how to stop being a people pleaser, a boring guy, and everything else that just makes me uninteresting. I need to also stop thinking about how awkward I am, or what I can do in certain situations. I want to become more fluid with my thoughts and actions, which will make me appear more confident.

My guitar has been missing a string for about 3 months, because I'm either thinking of how lame the day is going to be or regretting something I did in the past. Lately, this has been going tenfold ever since I ended a thing I had with the only girl I've actually tried to date, without simply waiting for something to happen. How can I get myself out of my bed or couch, and convince myself to get shit done and kick the day's ass? How can I convince myself to go grocery shopping, clean apartment, or take a goddamn shower?

My main goal out of all of this is to improve myself, more confident and happy life. I am, however, by no means a loser. I have friends how care about me, and have been told that I am one of the few most genuine people that anyone has ever met. If only they knew how troubled I was in my own head..

What I ask from all of you is to simply give me advice. Tell me your hobbies

TL;DR: Fuck you, you don't deserve to.

Her mom has said that she curses the day her daughter met me.
I try my best to be nice and not say anything but it's getting to be a little much.

Fun story time! This happened a while back. Her mom calls my phone up because my girlfriend doesn't have one. That's fine so she talks  to my g/f for a bit and learns that one of our friends is hanging out with us. So for some reason she wanted to talk to our friend. They had a short conversation and the call is over. Apparently she was trying to convince our friend to get my g/f to break up with me. Our friend was more than a little confused as to why she would want that.

I don't know what it is I have done to this women that has her so upset. I may not be prince charming but I think overall I'm a pretty pleasent person.

I could probably go on for hours but I'll try to keep it short.

Her mom is a recovering alcoholic. She just recently had to go into rehab and I guess now if she drinks again it will kill her.
She is also very manipulative. I have personally witnessed her lying about the dumbest things to try an make me look bad. Even when confronted face to face about something she has lied about she wont budge. She sticks with the lie no matter what.

I thought that now she is clean and is going to support groups that things would get a little better.

Now it just appears she has changed her game. She used to be really mean to my g/f too but now she is trying to get all cozy with her. It's great that she seems to want to get along with her daughter now but I think she is really just trying to dig in so she can better try an convince her that she should dump me.

That might sound a bit paranoid but I really think that is the case. I have seen her try and do exactly this many time but on a lesser scale. I feel so bad for my g/f because she has had to put up with so much abuse her entire life and she just wants to be loved and accepted by her family. Every time her mom starts being nice to her she gets so happy and it hurts to know that it's not going to last.

She has played her little game of trying to nice mommy before.
I actually told my g/f one time that she shouldn't get her hopes up because given a weeks time she will go right back to being a bitch. She didn't like hearing it but I ended up being right.

I've gone on to long as it is. There is so much more context but it would take forever to explain clearly. I don't know how to handle this situation anymore. Should I just keep on trying to ignore her? I feel that if I try to stand up for myself she will just twist my words and try to make me look like the bad guy to everyone she knows. Help? I'm lost.

tl;dr girlfriends mom is a lying manipulative bitch that hates me for no good reason

Fast forward to a couple days ago. I notice Erica is pretty scarce on the internets (she's usually on almost everyday, and she tell's me that she got back together with Stan.

I ask her why, and threatened her to send them to everyone she knows and basically ruin her life if she doesn't be his girlfriend. He says that someone 'anonymously emailed them to him', but I don't buy that. She agreed to be with him hoping that she could probably get a chance to delete the pictures or convince him to delete them.

This guy is a complete nutcase, but I honestly feel like this guy is holding all the trump cards, and there isn't much Erica or I, or anyone else can do until he decides to let her go, or delete the pictures.

Perhaps I should preface this with a bit about my past. When I was 14 my older brother died. When I was 15 my uncle died. When I was 16 my Grandmother died. When I was 19 someone died accidentally on the hood of my car, but I was in another car that was towing him on a sled; I ran out to help him and there was blood pouring out of his mouth onto my hands. This was 15 years ago. 

I've thought of writing one of these for a long time, and also afraid that I've become such a sociopath and destroyed my life to such an extent that I don't deserve help. 

At 33, and my ethical compass has long ago been shattered by my greed and monstrous sense of entitlement. I have a degree from a psuedo Ivy league school, but with a pretty useless communications degree, and after paying loans on and off for 10 years, I am still 30k in debt and live in a tiny room in a loft in Brooklyn. I've been living for the past two years on a combination of unemployment benefits and a settlement I received from a lawsuit. My unemployment ended a few weeks ago, and I have at most, savings to last me a month or two max. I also have an extremely spotty resume due to another period of my life where I was unemployed for 3 years and living in a squat. Actually, those were some of the best years of my life. I had a very small group of friends, in retrospect, as I could survive in NYC on very little money once again. Mostly though

Finally one day my lawyer suggested he could find me a therapist who would work for a potential cut of my eventual settlement, I managed to get a decent job with a lowly title but great pay and benefits including free MOMA passes, life insurance 401k etc. etc. I even managed to make some friends at work and achieve some small professional success designing ads. I met a beautiful, rich, intelligent, girl. She ended up consuming my entire being, and was the direct cause of my growing success, she treated me like shit, I had a real nervous breakdown and was fired for fucking up at work. Ironically the day after she dumped me I got a call from my lawyer saying I won my trial and was about to get a check for $46k. Once again, leaving a permanent

I put $4k into my student loans, I have another lawsuit in the works...once again, I am being rewarded for doing absolutely nothing.  

So here I am. 2 years later sitting in a tiny room with an obvious scar on my arm, and my limited interactions with humans feels like an act. I've lost the ability to empathize with other people. My sister just got out of brain surgery and I am too scared of having nothing to say that I won't even call her. This is mostly why I feel like I deserve death. i am so selfishly wrapped up in my own pathetic misery that I can't spare a shred of emotion for my own sister. I just sit in my tiny room on reddit and pretend the world doesn't exist. 

But now, and I have no job prospects and am too terrified of other humans to competently bullshit my way through a job interview. My social skills, even the thin veneer they once were have largely been obliterated by my refusal to participate in life. I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it. There is a gym next door to my apartment, but I am afraid of spending money on the gym and then running out of money entirely in a month because I can't get a job. I've had thoughts of buying a van to do moving jobs, but I haven't driven a car for 8 years...still I might get one and hire a driver. I did this a few years ago and made $60 an hour. Still, I can't do this for the rest of my life, and honestly have no idea how to figure out what I want to do. There are lots of things I would like to do, I read constantly.) but this is not really a realistic

TLDR: I'm 33, no woman, massive debt, no friends, suicidal, terrified of life. I'm down to $2k and no job. I want to change...but my fear outweighs my motivation. ",,,,

1271188532.0,bqfyg,"Reddit, how do I tell my sister that I think that aborting her baby would be the right decision?",mostlycareful,15,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bqfyg/reddit_how_do_i_tell_my_sister_that_i_think_that/

My sister is 16.  She lives in another state in the south with my mother.  Basically

I, got a degree, and currently work as a professional in a big city several hours away from where I grew up, probably making two or three times as much as my siblings and maybe even my parents.

Anyway

Things had been going well.  Since no one else in my family has taken any initiative to see that she goes to college

However, my mom tells me that my sister is pregnant.  She's 16 and the guy is 19.  He works part time at a big-box retailer and he's going to school at a community college.  My sister has told my mom that she wants to have the baby and not put it up for adoption.  She's a junior in high school and she thinks that after she has the baby her and her boyfriend will get married, move in together and live happily ever after.  The way I see it, it will be next to impossible for her to finish up her senior year (who will be able to keep the baby while she's at school?  How can she go to school if she can't get much sleep b/c of the baby, etc?).  She also still thinks she will be able to pull off going to a reputable school like Vanderbilt with a 1 year old child.

I know, I don't see this happening.  She isn't responsible at all.  She's never had a job and never really had to deal with the real world consequences of her actions.  I think that she thinks she'll have this child and if raising it is too hard my mom will just raise it for her (which, imo, will be a disaster in itself).  Years ago, my sister got a puppy, swearing up and down that she would take care of it and pay for vet bills, etc, etc) and she didn't hold up her end of the bargain so my mom eventually gave the kitten away.  Now she has another dog that my mom basically takes care of for her.  So she's never really had to be very responsible.

I haven't talked to my sister about this.  My plan is to go visit her in a couple of days and to take her out somewhere where we can talk without my mom around and tell her what a terrible mistake I think she will be making if she has this child.  I just don't know what I""m going to say.  I do know that I'm going to point out that if she has this child

Let me add that I do realize that it is her life and she can do whatever she wants.  I'm not by any means trying to take this decision away from her or anything like that.  I just feel like she's living in a fantasy world right now where her bf has convinced her that they will live happily ever after if she has this child and he'll be able to support her and put her through college with his part-time job while also going to school and supporting a child.  My main goal for this talk I'm going to have with her will be at the very least to take her by her feet

The best case scenario as I see it is this: she decides to abort and I take a few days off work to help take care of her when she goes through the process.  I dated a woman once who got pregnant and decided to abort so I've kinda been through this process before and I at least have some idea of what to expect.

Sorry if I sound like my mind's a little scattered right now.  I'm still in shock with the whole situation.",,t5_2r367,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bqfyg/reddit_how_do_i_tell_my_sister_that_i_think_that/

Every single kid has some major health problem. I have no idea what she's doing during her pregnancy but they all have different problems. Her oldest daughter has had some kind of heart problem since birth and needed a few surgeries just to live after she was born. Her middle kid had some kind of trauma where she was bed-ridden for most of the pregnancy and I'm not sure exactly what his deal is. She just had another kid a few weeks ago and already they're in and out of the hospital for various reasons and running all kinds of tests on the poor kid. I truly feel sorry for her and her boyfriend (he's only the father of the newest). They are truly in love but I don't see how they can care for all these kids that need special attention. She currently has no job and I'm not sure what her boyfriend does but it can't be paying well. He's a great guy (who's got his own kidney problems) but for as long as I've known him he's never been the brightest bulb in the pack. How do I help them see that continuing to have kids is only going to hurt them financially and detract from the needs of their current children? I'm by no means against kids with disabilities.

I only mention this because, deep down, I would like this to reach them... not for any gain to my mom - simply because they deserve to know who's lifestyles they fund through their purchases.

I work in a store with a bunch of guys who I'm friendly with. After work, probably old enough to be my dad (I am 22). 

Throughout the night he kept coming up to me, but telling off a guy that much bigger than me could actually put me in danger. Eventually, drunk me and my coworkers decided a good way to get him to leave me alone would be to give him my number. I created a google voice number and wrote it on a coaster. It may have worked, because he left immediately after that. I planned to just delete the number, but forgot about it and over the course of the past week he has called me multiple times a day, texted me calling me pet names, and leaving me increasingly aggressive and borderline threatening messages.

I KNOW it was stupid to give him that number. I don't need retroactive advice on how dumb of an idea that was. I was planning on just blocking the number and going about my life, when I wasn't working, he showed up at my job after we had closed asking for ""the girl who works here."" My coworkers told him I wasn't there and texted me telling me about it. So now, I don't want to block the number in case telling him off over text is the best option.

So far, and I don't want to get in trouble for it. I just don't know what to do. I'm totally at a loss and kind of scared. I would tell him to stop contacting me but he knows where I work and I don't know if doing that would make him angrier.

I’m 19 y/o and my name’s mat.  During the past 2 years or so I’ve been having problems with my ‘cognition’ and I really need some help.  I will start by explain what I have been experiencing.
-Memory issues:  Having a terrible short/medium term memory.  Trouble remembering pretty much anything like events, etc

-Trouble speaking:  Basically not having a clear presentation (mumbling at times, I can’t go 1 minute without searching for a word and my memory blanking out on me. This makes it incredibly hard to speak because I feel very stupid and my flow is terrible.

-Emotional issues: A lot of ups and downs with my emotions.  Days where I feel very depressed not wanting to do anything with my life and pondering on my existence.  Other days I’m fine but I can’t call it happy
  
I also have a lot of anxiety and confidence issues, especially girls.  I wouldn’t want to be approached to closely because of my face.  
A general sense of mind fog.  I don’t really know how to explain it but I don’t feel sharp mentally.  Concentrating

I have made some lifestyle changes in the past 2 weeks to try and help myself. 
-I’ve been smoking cannabis daily for 2 years now; I have recently stopped though as I think it was detrimental to my cognition. This week has been a bit better; the fog is a tad less noticeable which I am happy about.  

-I have started to read out loud 1 hour a day

-I have cut out competitive gaming as it would put me in a negative headspace and stress me out.

-I started meditation 15 minutes every day

-I eat way better now, with some vitamins every day. I also started working out.


I feel a bit better about myself now but I am still having all the problems I stated before


Now I would really appreciate some insight on this; why is this happening to me.  Anything I can do that will help me?  Could be anything, nootropics, brain games, speech exercises, etc

* Their dogs have to be locked in their room all day because they work opposite schedules (one at night

* They CAN feed their dogs out of the room. Feeding just needs to be supervised
* It is true there isn't much time when one person is awake at home, although it is very true. When the dogs are out when nobody is watching them, they get destructive.

Their solutions to the problems are

* Lock the cats up in one room so they can't eat the dog food/train the cats to not eat the dog food.

1375699578.0,1jqel1,"Dad's death, my depression, university - and then there is my mum...",Rae_Starr,13,9, because it really *is* a long story...

I've been struggling with **psychological problems** for a few years (and only last few months have I actually gotten help) these range from depression, crazy. It's in the family tree. These issues were around all through high school easily starting around 15 (or earlier). At the moment I'm on medication and in therapy and have done online courses given by my doctor - but that got pretty derailed when my dad died a month ago (June 16th) just after I turned 18 (June 12th).

***

**Dad's death** was unexpected - at least to us - he was 44 years old. He'd been getting better recently, with a large range of other health problems. He died at home, in the middle of the night from a heart attack, in his sleep. My brother found him in the morning when he slept over. There was a police investigation since they didn't know the problem until the autopsy - where they also discovered another of his problems had been created by an undetected stroke - but it didn't go too far since there was no foul play. Then it became a disaster...

Me, but just for remembering) and got everything else he wanted. However, I didn't take everything I wanted since I was trying to be respectful to Nana and was going to make sure I didn't take something she really wanted.

We went to a funeral for my Great Uncle who had died the day after dad and we were away for one night. Nana and Mark had decided to come down while we were away (and we had told them we'd be at the funeral) without calling us and ""clean out the house"". They took everything of worth... and *put everything else in the trash*. Literally, dad's ""friend"" said they'd cleaned up, went over and found a skip bin filled with everything ""worthless"". I found all the books from his book shelf, photos of me, James and dad, more of his art, some things from my room I'd missed, baby pictures of dad... basically my entire childhood and memories of my dad. Shoved in a giant bin amongst broken class and rusty saws. ""Worthless"".

Dad's friend came back to collect the furniture that evening. But, dad had built before he came back with his trailer - he'd lied and told us it was already gone. He had planned to sell it to a friend. I am lucky to have saved anything. I spent two days in the skip bin, searching for all the little things, and was lucky to find some things not broken under it all. I hurt so much.

We had his funeral

***

I love **university**. I'm studying psychology and look forward to it most days. I did decide to only do 3 units/subjects this semester (not 4), and my concentration is off. I'm still doing okay, but my anxiety makes it difficult.

I don't spend as much time doing it as I should - the homework aspect. I'm usually really tired

***

**THE PROBLEM**

My mum - she is full on, angry, grumpy, scary, ""tired"" ... and my mother. I'm the oldest of 3 kids (James (15) and Ariel (7) - Ariel is my half-sister) and basically take on the role of second parent. I can't remember a time where I didn't look after them. I looked after James when I was with dad at 7+ and have been looking after Ariel since 11. 

I baby sit, look after, feed and train the ""family"" puppy AND *clean everything, all the time* - I cannot stress this enough, my mum is insane about me cleaning the entire house. I don't know if it's possible to imagine how stressed I get from this (it may even sound stupid) but I clean *everything*. Kitchen, bathroom, lounge room, my room (fair enough), the trash, before dinner

I am happy to contribute to the house by cleaning - but then I get verbally abused because I STILL never clean enough. She always says I am useless and lazy and do *nothing*. She uses at least a dozen swear words per sentence when she's mad - her favourite line ""Why couldn't you just fucking [what ever the problem is]""... I *always* seem screw up in her mind.

Most teenagers seem go out to parties, maybe do drugs or smoke, have unprotected sex, neglect their studies, watch tv or movies a lot, or go online. Me? I go online. I'm 18 (legal drinking age, in a drinking culture) and I don't touch it. I specifically bought myself some bottles of non-alcoholic wine for my 18th birthday party (combined with close friends 18th) so I didn't have to drink or be judged. I don't touch smoking or drugs, I am usually awake early 6-7am every single day (Sunday's included). I'm not out having a ton of random sex (not that it really matters, clubs. I stay at home either studying, babysitting

SO WHY AM I NEVER GOOD ENOUGH!?!?

I hate how she always talks about how hard she works - but how can she think I ""do nothing""? How else do the kids get to school on time, teeth brushing, hair brushing (the 3 foot mane Ariel has grown), lunch packing, getting her dressed, checking she has the right things for the right days ... and having them on a school bus at 8.30 am. THEN I get ready to go to university, ~~walk~~ run into town to catch the local bus, since I don't sleep without nightmares or waking up all night

Usually by the time I get home mum is mad about something I forgot to do that morning - like some washing she never told me about or dirty dishes Ariel left on the sink. She always ~~complains~~ yells that I should ""just know"" what should be done.

Well you know what... I DO NOT FUCKING KNOW WHAT YOU WANT! She never explains anything, but don't worry you did other stuff"", no list of expectations, no conversations about it because she ""doesn't want to have to tell us what to do""... There is nothing to work from - and she is never around, and we never know what to expect.

It endless. I also think she doesn't really believe I'm depressed, where I'm so afraid to even get out of bed... I just end up crying from fear and frustration. I don't sleep well, so I'm always exhausted. I struggle to look after myself and never go out on social events. I get so stressed my back, shoulders and joints hurt, I feel sick and get headaches, I cry, I have terrifying nightmares

So yes

**TL;DR: My mum controls me, my dad died and I just can't keep up with what she expects from me.**

I have a little brother who's 12 right now, and just insult me. Like I said, they used to try to make me do chores around the house but now all they do is try to get me asleep.

However, I'll let people walk too soon which causes me to lose a potential lead and also upsets my boss. 

It seems like I've gotten ""almost but not quite"" with many guests I've talked to, but I want to be able to complete a sale on my own.

I am very confident in my ability to build rapport with people, special rates, and credit situations because this is my first time in any sort of sales atmosphere. I'm also very good about following up with people, but I've had a number of folks who never answer their phonecalls or e-mails which makes my job more difficult and it makes me look like I'm not doing anything.

I guess I'm looking for better ways to overcome any objections people have

I really want to do better here because I feel like it's my calling and I want to move up to high-end car sales. I got this job a week after the end of the semester and I see it as the perfect opportunity to start on that career path. I just need to figure out what I'm doing and how to do it effectively.

She really hates when older college students tell her about their experiences and whatnot unsolicited (unless they are close to her), because she just wants to experience it all with a fresh perspective and will ask about certain things if she really wants to know.

At the time, she would ask. 

Before I go on, she said she was just joking, but the damage had already been done on my end - all of my responses to her questions were short and monotone, which for me is a sure sign that I'm angry. At that point, I had to go get ready for my mom's birthday dinner so I said I'd talk to her later.

I need someone else's take on this. anyone.


why am I moving out? there are several reasons.

my parents house is toxic. we do nothing but fight and talk about what a disappointment I am. we barely ever connect (hell, he did confirm his meaning - he did not want me masturbating. true fucking story.


I want to live a life that attempting to live under my parents’ roof would be both inconvenient and disrespectful. I want to party, because the plan has been “fuck around until college. do as little as necessary to graduate” since I found out that I wasn’t going back to my early-college program. that’s not fair to make my parents watch. no parent wants to see their kid smoke pot and accomplish nothing. also, living with my parents is just inconvenient, with things like curfews and their tendency to dig through my stuff and then yell at me for it (see: vibator, above).


I don’t feel like I can be myself at my parents’ house. I feel like I’m constantly pretending. gotta be cautious about what I say or where I go, which is a stressful way to live for both of us.


my family and I get along wayyyy better when we don’t live together. when my parents and I aren’t fighting or forced to live with each others’ shenanigans, who experience massive anxiety at the hands of mine and my parents’ disagreements.


I feel like I have to get out of my parents’ house to actually accomplish any real strides in my growing up/recovering/making myself a reasonably productive member of society. being here makes me want to play angsty-fifteen-year-old and rebel. except in decidedly grown-up ways. 

I want to. I’m going to be honest


why I shouldn’t move out:

it would upset my family. everyone is unhappy about this


it would be expensive. I can afford it, meaning I have job options.


it’s a lot of responsibility. this is self-explanatory. adulthood is scary.


it could backfire horribly


**TL;DR living with my family is hard


I don't know what to do, and she told me to pray. so, thoughts? **am I doing the right thing by moving out? am I being a rash, petulant child?**

I thought when I wrote to them that I'd enjoy it a little but it's the opposite. Instead, but last week I felt like I wanted to.

The problem isn't whether or not I should leave though. I *know* that I want to leave, it's depressing and I feel so crap before, during and after it.

How am I supposed to go about leaving this job? I doubt it'll go down well with my superiors if I tell them that I want to leave and those are the people who I need to get references from.

First some background: I'm a 19 year old guy, but things had kind of been starting to even out. 

Now, and my maternal extended family is a very religious family (Catholic). I am not religious, though I am by no means antitheistic. Unfortunately, my respect for my mom's beliefs (her religious ones anyhow) is not reciprocated. Nevertheless, I try to avoid being confrontational because, though I do not agree, I do understand her perspective. That being said, because there is a very thin line between the sort that are crazy, I'm not exactly why this would matter considering the fact that the Papacy returned to Rome ~500 years ago (I forget the exact date). I argued with her, paranoid conspiracy claptrap. It went down hill from there. I don't remember the order or the details

Anyway, and did not understand at all why any of this bothered me. It is odd, because she does not seem to think what she believes is fringe (she told me this) and that I am somehow the one with the fringe beliefs. She then proceeded to tell me that I am just naive, young, that I don't know anything, and just general sorts of assertions that I was wrong. It hurts, a lot, to believe them).

1359955391.0,17uoaa,Constant thorn in my side,brillyx,11,1,24,"Hey everyone

I'm a 17 year old junior currently in high school. I transferred to a high school outside my area with very different kinds of kids than in my area. I only had one other friend going there from my area in freshman year. It was pretty rough getting into the groove of things

But this isn't about how my high school life is so far, and how I feel about the way others treat me.

I guess it starts back at 3rd grade when I transferred to public elementary school from a catholic school. I was the kid that liked Yugioh and pokemon and thought I had friends even though most kids thought I was weird. I really don't remember 3rd grade all that well

4th, but more of the friends that people thought were weird or 'uncool'. I was always concerned about what people thought about me, so I often got anxious whenever people would question why I hung out with these kids that I got along well with. That has how I've been, and I'm not sure if a little bit still remains in me today, for as long as I can remember ever since I started 3rd grade. Always conforming to the group's norms. 

Fast forward to 7th and 8th grade, they called me a queer, they basically leeched off me to gain their own confidence and self esteem. They really crippled my confidence, it took me months to get my courage back. I fucking hate them for what they did to me mentally. But enough about them, I am getting side tracked from the main point here.

Come 9th grade, which I hate) Now picture you're in my place. The only friend you have at a new school, new people, everyone else has their groups they hang out with, and you're alone in your friend's shadow. You'll be talking with him and people will say hi to him but not to you, you'll be talking and people will pull him off to the side or start talking to him while you're in mid-sentence. People won't even regard you talking to him or standing there with him. It's one of the worst feelings in the world. It took me a long time to make friends at the school. I was cutting the line pretty close to almost committing suicide. It was bad.

By the end of the year, I was still in the shadow of my other friend.

You see, I always have to be the one that calls the name. Why? Am I trying too hard? Do I put people off for some reason? 

I always make a meaningless effort to have good body language

I tried being myself, am I just naturally a fool and people can pick flaws out of what I do or what I say and get the group to laugh and put me down? Am I just cursed by fate and I'm one of the million people born into being the clown? Am I over thinking this too much?

I always think to myself ""Do people not like me or am I over thinking that they don't when they really do?"". It's so hard to tell. I also feel anxious talking to certain people that I deem as 'cool' because I think they don't want to associate with me

For most of my life I have felt like there is a class system in the schools I've been to. You have your kids that are losers and the kids that are 'cool' or 'popular'. And for a lot of my life, I never feel satisfied with my current status. There is always another group that I crave to be accepted by. And I know a lot of you might think ""well that's just silly, not EVERYONE is going to like you"", but you see, there are some people I know that everyone DOES seem to like, and when I see those people I get so fucking jealous. Like what makes them so great that they can have the appeal of everyone else? It's horse shit.

I have found that I have gotten to be an extremely jealous person over the years. Jealous of my male friends that have had girlfriends or lost their virginity, just so I can feel like I have some pride. I always tell myself ""Oh you'll get a girlfriend before so and so"" or ""So and so is so bad with girls, you'll definitely have a girlfriend before him"" but you know what, there are some really scummy or socially awkward kids that have had more pussy than I have ever gotten in my whole life. 

I always feel like I have to prove myself to others so I can be deemed as cool or someone people [I]want[/I] to know. I always feel like I have to put up this 'perfect' image so I won't lose my chances of people liking me. It really is a constant burden.

Not only that, but I'm too afraid or unmotivated to do something amazing to be noticed. I feel intimidated by people that are more popular than I am or people that have a lot of friends and are deemed as 'cool'. I don't want to believe that I have a depression illness because I don't want to be categorized as some sad sucker who is a loser and can't take life. But who knows? Maybe I am.

What do I mean by ""negative"" self-confidence? I mean that he can tell us with a straight face, worthless person on Earth (I have no idea what qualifies as terrible for him). It's confidence in being worth nothing. We don't understand at all: he's probably one of the most helpful guys in our group, really nice guy who never lets anyone down. He's fairly intelligent and has ridiculous drive; if he sees something needs to get done and it is in his or someone close to him's interest, he WILL get it done, ridiculously well at that. He has a strong sense of morals and goes out of his way to help people too, and still manages to get done whatever he was doing (Helped me and another friend with our 2 projects even though it was going to make him late for his, but he still finished it on time and he even got great marks). Appearance-wise, no extra fat, right"". He's mentioned that he ""just can't believe them"" or ""can't take them seriously"". Also, he considers himself to be a failure

Maybe we're shoving our noses where it doesn't belong, and we're being honest when we tell him that we think that if he could think about himself positively, he could probably have as much money, women, and whatever else he wanted, that he's got ridiculous potential, but he just calmly says that he's not really interested in any of that. It's like he's living not for the sake of enjoying life, but I mean what kind of terrible past can you have to make you think like this if you're only 20?

Now that, you have no idea how much it would be appreciated.

I will start with some background, attending UW-Oshkosh and am pursing my degree in Hydrogeology. I have been in a unhealthy relationship with a girl named Ashley for 8 months now and it has been spiraling my life out of control. I do not blame her for what has happened to me but she has played some part. I love this girl with every breath I take but each time it has been slowly killing me. She has serious trouble dealing with her depression and most of time it falls upon me to help keep her up, which has been draining me physically, mentally, and financially. We were doing fine up, but then the day we started to move into our new apartment we were robbed. We lost most of our things and this was all due to our landlords leaving our apartment unlocked after leaving. We are now locked in a court battle with our landlord who refuses to pay for our damages, even though they are responsible for our losses. After this, and I spend the other time at the apartment. I have spoken with her and have spent a lot of money replacing our stolen belongings and fixing the apartment

So with this taking up so much of my time, and she has not control over what she is doing. So I neglect what I should be doing and come to her aid. I have spent all my money trying to make her happy and give her the things she wants but only now do I see that this was never helping. My grades are at an all low, I won't have enough money to pay rent, and I feel worthless inside cause I can't make the one person I love happy.  

This is Ashley and I.
http://imgur.com/aEL1g

After all of this I have finally found the will to get help and I have been talking to a therapist for the past week now. I have also talked to Ashley about what has been going on and she has acknowledged somethings but overall wishes to stay ignorant to what is going on. She has agreed to start talking her meds again as well as starting to see her therapist. We remain together though distance now but I am still unsure if seeing her is the right choice

So now I am at my biggest problem and that is being able to staying in college. I have talked with my teachers and I will be doing my best with trying to salvage what is left of my semester in the hopes of getting a passing grade. This will be hard but what I am truly worried about is my finical situation, because of how much money they actually owe me. I have talked to my lawyer and he sees really no way around this.

Now I know all of you are thinking,000 dollars in debt due to college and nobody will ever touch me to give me another loan, even so I couldn't afford the payment. I feel isolated and alone, so that is why I have come here to rant and see if there is anyone out there who can give me a shred of advice or even a dollar.

 I need some advice on how to deal with my grandmother's chemo and radiation treatment, and embarrassed about the noises her bag makes. Her stoma is right below her ribs, so she's concerned this means it won't be easy to hide, as opposed to the stoma regularly being around the waist.


 As far as my grandmother's situation; my family, so this is a whole new experience. My grandmother just had her first round of chemo treatment earlier this week, and we can definitely tell the effects are starting to hit her. I've already read up on a few ways to help her through this process, like no food smells, (this is horribly hard. The only thing my recently moved in uncle deems himself worthy of doing around the house is cook, and when he does; he stinks up the house. He's got such a bad temper, I can't tell him this, etc. I just want to know if there's anything else I should know


 However, along with my 2 year old cousin. He doesn't do anything to contribute the family or the house aside from cook. He has a job as a referee for soccer, but he only makes enough to pay for the gas to get him to his games. The reason for him moving in is a relationship that went bad, and him deciding his best bet would be to move in with his mom/us. However, after the drama from his ruined relationship, he's turned to drinking, causing beer cans and disrespect everywhere. Especially with my mom. They're constantly fighting, her getting her bag, but even she can't get him to leave


 Oh, so he's decided to let his son move in, although this was only supposed to last for a month. His son and himself also fight constantly.


 My uncle wouldn't even have the baby if his daughter wasn't involved in drugs and hadn't already had a child beforehand.

I don't know if this is stupid or self-indulgent, I'm living my dream that I had since I was a little kid. Things are going great professionally, and I feel like I have it pretty good and shouldn't be feeling this way, especially given how bad many other people have it. In fact I almost feel like an asshole just posting this, I know everyone has problems.

Introspective self-diagnosis isn't exactly my strong suit, but it stopped feeling quite as great, even though I know it is and it's still exciting, but it somehow doesn't reach me anymore. Other things I love to do don't seem to get through either, I'm just sad really often. 

At first I thought I just worked too much (I'm pretty sure I have OCD, but doesn't seem to have addressed the basic issue. After a lot of thought I've reached the (embarrassingly obvious) conclusion that I'm just lonely. Even though I maintain very meaningful friendships abroad with people I've met over the years, I don't really have any friends in the city and I'm not sure how to make some that I can relate to. (Because I live fairly far away from the university, work-friends aren't really available in that sense.)

I joined a martial arts academy and go regularly, but even though everyone there is awesome I feel alienated from other people. As soon as you're the scientist you become this larger-than-life curiosity that gets quizzed about sciency questions (which is fine) but beyond that people don't know what to do with you, and it's mutual. I crave human connection but don't seem to be able to find it. I tried online dating, but decided I should get the rest of my house in order before looking for another relationship, and it just ended up being a tedious and expensive way to get laid every now and then, with no real human connection. I don't want to go on medication because this depression is a clear signal that there's something wrong with my life that I have to fix. I feel as powerless against it as any chemical imbalance, but given my past history and temperament I just don't think it's an innate psychiatric problem

Before I get to the next one, but I had absolutely no work ethic left for the third, so Dr.Smith let my contract expire. I can't blame my laziness on him, but I will say his constant angry mood and belittling of his grad students didn't help me find any motivation, but did help me discover that I have a fragile ego.

Okay, so I know that at one point he had a good opinion of me. The trouble is he is close friends with Dr. Smith, the spiteful, ill-tempered former boss of mine who has legitimate reason to disparage my ability to work as an engineer. And this is another guy I haven't talked to for a year. I know I really should have contacted him earlier, but, well, chalk it up to another case of me ruining my life by way of excessive procrastination.

""Dr.Awesome"" is what I'll call the next guy, but again, he's awesome. I'd wager that most redditors would idolize him after reading his Wikipedia or IMDb page, but linking that would make me too identifiable to anyone that knows me as I talk about him every chance I get.

I'm in my early 20s and have had depression/anxiety for a VERY long time. I was in a really horrible place when I started college, etc. Last winter I finally decided to get psychiatric help (I'd been bucking it forever.) My psychiatrist and I decided that medication was a good option, and I began trying different things to see what worked best. But I had a terrible reaction to one dosage and became extremely anxious. I was plagued by gruesome images of my own suicide. Afraid I'd harm myself, I phoned my parents and they flew up to my college to calm me down. I was too afraid to go to my college mental health services, because once you mention ""suicide,"" they really start recommending you take time off (I know, I still should have gone, long story short

I expected that over time they'd loosen the leash and we'd go back to our call-once-a-day deal.

I hope this is the right subreddit for those kind of questions...

I recently turned 19 and i`ve been thinking alot about my mental status. I just seem to not be able to open myself to other people or to be in any kind of relationship.

Maybe its connected to my rather unusual childhood. I`ve never seen my parents kiss or act like if they were actually together. 

My dad died when I was 8, in the same apartment, but somewhere upstairs in another apartment, eventhough we were in the same house. So I actually got raised by my parents, who loved eachother, but my mum just couldnt live together with my dad because of her psychosis. 

Just shortly after that my grandmother and grandfather died, but her psychosis really got onto her, I often found her crying alone at night.

Long story short

1324462428.0,nl48r,Renting a room from a friend. Is this situation fair?,Housemate,13,4,15,"Hi Reddit! Throwaway here

I, and therefore has a pretty well paying graduate job which pays him enough to get a mortgage. For the past few months I have been living in the spare room in his flat (that's apartment for USians). I just wanted to see if any other redditors are in similar situations and whether you think our current arrangement is fair on both parties.

Now for the details:

- My friend owns the flat leasehold

- We split the water/heating/electricity/tv bills 50/50, but as his girlfriend visits every weekend it probably evens out.

- We split the cost of the mortgage 50/50. Of course my flatmate is the only one who will see any return on this investment as I'm just paying it as rent. Of course he reminds me that the majority of the money paid just goes into killing the interest.

- Total cost to me is roughly £80/week. The flat is recently refurbished and only ten minutes walk from the city centre, we were able to get a small house in an awesome location, paying £66/week without bills - this house, however, was not in a great condition and did have a fair bit of mould. Housemates there did not include my current flatmate.

- Our bedrooms are roughly equal size. His is slightly larger and has a floor-to-ceiling window but this is the only real difference. We share the living-room/kitchen and bathroom.

- We share cleaning/cooking duties. There's been some friction on this in the past

- The furnishings in the shared areas are his. I can use his Xbox360 and sit on his nice expensive sofa etc. Everything in my room is my own

------

So

-----

Now the other half is the issue of having guests. Now when it comes down to it, according to the tendency agreement, allowed to sublet — but I figure this is more to stop the whole flat being rented out, rather than the spare room. I pay in cash.

Obviously as it is his flat, but sometimes from Thursday. In the past few months he's had some uni friends stay once, some friends from work pop over for some xbox and pizza and, of course, his parents. So you get the picture, apart from his girlfriend, it's not often

On the other hand, informing him in advance would be a nice gesture, but I don't feel it should be required. I also feel that if someone comes back to my room and doesn't bother him, then that's of no concern to him. The current situation makes me feel rather like a teenager trapped at home with his parents, rather than a man in his early(ish) twenties.

My flatmate's concerns range from the possibility that guests who turn up late with me after a few beers may disturb his sleep, I have not woken him up as I have been quiet and considerate. On the other hand, I had to babysit him after he returned from a work party last week, until he was able to get to sleep, and then got up after six hours sleep to call him in sick for work...

- Have good admin job where I work from home 99% of the time.
- Pay is ""decent"" (a little lower than the average I see on all those salary websites)

My dilemma is that I really like my current job and love working from home.  I get to see my new daughter grow up, some other things, etc...), this new job (even though it's 20% more pay) ends up being about ~300 extra dollars a month.

- My mom seems to avoid my phone calls. I'll call her house and cell

- She obviously favors my brothers. My middle brother is in prison and she makes the 45-minute drive once a week to give him shampoo

- I own my own business and have done so successfully, who has a desk job, can get me a ""real job"". 

- She'll make plans, with poor excuses. 

- She's never outwardly mean but she makes jokes, she'll tell me to lighten up.

&lt;preface&gt;

I've been a redditor for about a year now.  I've laughed, but I've never actually posted anything.  So please forgive any bad reddiquette.  I promise I am not here for karma or for pity, I just need some advice.

&lt;\preface&gt;

I am concerned that I am not completely psychologically stable.


I think to properly explain myself
  
I'm 21 years old, and bipolar disorder on my paternal side. Also, I have been diagnosed with complex partial epilepsy, but I'm not sure if that is relevant.

I have never been officially diagnosed with depression, the second time I was 16.  I don't think that my depression is because of a genetic disorder or chemical imbalance, I think it is because of a ridiculous childhood, but I am not a doctor. Also, I am NOT considering suicide right now, to be clear.

The things I find disconcerting at the moments are:

-I don't sleep regularly.  I usually only sleep for a couple hours a night.  Sometimes though

-When I do sleep I have nightmares.  Every night, and/or chased.  Usually I am being held underwater.  Usually by the same person.  This has not helped my insomnia, as it is difficult to sleep when you know this is what is in store for you.  Does anyone else have nightmares every night?  Is this something that is normal?

-Most of the time, helping my older brother detox from an oxycontin addiction.  He said he needed to come home, so I moved us both about 4000km (2500ish miles, I think) home to be with our family.  It's been nearly a year, and I haven't cried.  I don't actually remember the last time I really cried.  I have shed maybe 3 tears since then (I am a master of the single-tear, though). Isn't it normal to cry over these things?

-When I feel too much emotion

-Sometimes when I daydream, ""Hello? Did you hear what I just said?""  
Is this normal?

I have never told anyone most of what is posted above.  Most of the people in my life would tell you that I am the happiest person they know

I guess what I am asking is, I think I can deal with it, but if it's something more I'm not sure what to do.

Also

I am incredibly uncomfortable with all emotions, or how to find that kind of help in my area, if that is what I need to do.

I hope this was clear. I'd be very grateful for anyone's opinion or advice.  Feel free to ask me anything that will be helpful.



**EDIT:  It was mentioned that I should say in my post the the person chasing/trying to kill me in my dreams is a man that molested me as a child.  He was my mom's boyfriend, as there were other girls involved as well.  I never had to see him after my grandma took me away.  I have a hard time talking about this, but you're probably right Reddit, it might seem a bit like a troll without it.  Thank you all so much for all your thoughtful responses.  I'll start responding to them now.**

* Get a part-time job that covers the monthly expenses and leaves me with enough free time. If it doesn't cover expenses and i can't devote more time to it
* Do my thing.

This is just an idea and i'm not sure if it would work. I also don't know if the math works out on that; i'll find out. I don't want to run my savings dry after a year. I want a sustainable situation.

Living with my parents for a little longer is also an option

So

This all ended the exact moment I finished college.

The perfect analogy is saying that I'm the worst player in MLB. However, but I suck at these tedious, mind-numbingly boring jobs.

I wanted to start my business senior year of college. I was wooed to a Wall Street job, on the first day. I had no choice in the matter. I have no idea why anyone thought I was that capable/smart to begin with. I hate math, I only did well because I STUDIED MY ASS OFF, not because it was second nature to me like others in the group. Had they kept me in the job I applied for and got, I would have been okay. Not a rockstar, but I wouldn't have felt like the biggest idiot in the room almost everyday. I was able to keep up but didn't innovate or add any true value besides a mechanical understanding of what the hell was going on. But even still I couldn't help but make countless careless mistakes. At one point I was so nervous I couldn't fill out the the number $500,000, and got another job at a Fortune 500. At this point my confidence was pretty low.

At this new company I did better, tennis) was not interesting to me; corporate policies and red tape made no sense to me; many meetings I felt were pointless and I made this objection by inadvertently nodding to sleep; I didn't ""howdie doo!"" the right people; I'm in the South and everybody just seemed so different and conservative-- someone almost had a screaming match with me about global warming not being real; my first manager had a terrible reputation in the company, which did not help me get any visibility. Two years into this job there is a shake up and I get placed with a new manager who is former child prodigy, and his boss who was Einstein reincarnate. The analogy to this would be holding a candle (me) to the binary star of Alpha Centauri (my manager and our director). I think this hurt me in the sense that in any other group I would have gotten better reviews, which means a promotion, and more money. But with this group I was just average. Or the worst performer of the 3. So my reviews are showing up as me being an average employee as I'm being rated compared to my superstar counterparts. Where as other analysts in our sister group who were doing (and I'm being honest) much easier assignments were getting rave reviews and promotions. The VP wasn't going to promote me despite me doing comparable work that was done by senior analysts and managers in our sister group which irked me. I felt my career was stalling after 3.5 years in virtually the same position.

Also during this time, I read ""The 4-Hour Workweek"". And I know most of you think this guy is a hack, but he had some gems in the book. I latched onto the idea of creating passive income and began work on niche sites and internet marketing. 3 years later I found myself in debt settlements with credit card companies and I probably sunk some $30,000 into various internet ideas/ventures that didn't pan out.

I got bored with my assignments and left the group and now I'm doing a job in finance I absolutely hate within the same company. But I feel stuck: I'm broke, like every life decision I've made was wrong and that I'm living my worst fears. Its freaking me out. My worst fears were to fail, be alone, and be broke. Check, check, and double check.

I'm studying for the GMAT, and I don't know what my next move should be. On top of that I'm the heaviest I've ever been in my life. I've made a resolution to eat a slow carb diet this year, but I don't have time to exercise until I take my GMAT in March. But the man boobs and pot belly is not really helping my already shattered confidence. Nor is studying GMAT questions and realizing how tough it's going to be to get a 700+.

She got murdered by a boyfriend. Can't show our son when I'm crying. Still cry when I think about how I had to tell him. Worst day of my life

Now I'm a single dad, losing hope that there is one. So lonely. Hard to fill that hole with friends when you're limited in how often you can go out. Not that it matters. Everything that helps a little feels like sham, a way to distract myself. Terrible at meeting people. Not scared... just can't figure out what to say to strangers. Dating sites only make me feel worse. No responses. Maybe I'm too ugly. Never thought I was. I'm not getting any younger, but I'm still in my 20s. Maybe it's because I'm a dad? Doesn't matter. I can't have my happiness dependent on someone else. It just seems like the fight would be so much better with someone else there.

I can feel my life... slipping by. It constantly flows past, I would have just fled. Move somewhere new. Burn my old life away, build anew somewhere else. Can't do that with my son. He's an anchor. Prevents me from going crazy or extreme, regardless of if those are good or bad.

I feel.. separate from the world. The real me is telling the world me 'go here, I feel helpless, small, alone on the inside. Sometimes I even see myself when I was a kid, inside my current self, controlling it like a robot suit.

I know things can always change. I'm not going to pay anyone to say what I'm saying here. I'm very introspective, and still grieving for someone. Knowing why doesn't make it better. I refuse to delude myself. Can't focus on the what ifs either, that would kill me. A million ways my best friend and ex-wife could still be here. Have to keep reminding myself there are a million ways she could not be here, too. No point playing that game. Just... don't know what I can do. So alone, and disappointed. Every day ""tomorrow could be better"", and then  it's not.

I'm an undergrad.  I just recently made a mistake, and only lowered my grade and gave me no points for a particular assignment.

I plagiarized, and an even larger one for attempting it.    I thought that I had disguised the work well enough, but disguised a little too much, and the prof. saw right through it.  I'm actually pretty glad that he did see it, because it gave me the slap in the face that I needed.

It's not even that I couldn't do the assignment and was too shy to ask for help

If you finish your work yourself, you know you busted your ass to get it, and that it's all your own.  If you get a fucking D on a project, it's a D you worked for.  If you get an A on some shit you didn't bother to even think about yourself, it's not deserved.

I've learned my lesson, Sherlock.  He's a professor and he's probably seen and dealt with the shit before.""  Well, yeah.  I had that thought too before I did it, but still attempted it like a dumb-ass.

So, excited attitude (although it seemed more forced than genuine, like an airplane stewardess' ""bye bye now!"") and told us that there had been a few changes. Apparently our bus had some sort of mechanical trouble, and we would be getting a different bus which was on its way.

Ok, she was hopeful that some people wouldn't show up and we would be fine. ""What if everyone shows up?"" I asked. She said that would mean that she and her husband would have to drive separately. Whoa, I thought, what a nice person, willing to make that kind of a sacrifice for complete strangers.

Well, shortly before the bus arrived, our ""captain"" announced that she would need to see four of the potential passengers in private and called out their names. Needless to say, this was a bit unsettling to the entire group. When they came back, it was announced to us that four people would not be able to go with us to DC, and that if no one wanted to volunteer to stay, these four unlucky people (the last ones to register) would be out of luck. There were a couple of volunteers

When we got on the bus, the heat could not be adjusted from inside the bus (only turned on or off), and the restrooms were to be used for ""liquids only."" The seats weren't exactly roomy or comfortable. Some of our travel mates began to grumble and complain, but my friends and I stayed positive, determined to have a good time.

The bus got us to the rally around 12:15, so it was cool. The real drama didn't start until afterward when we were supposed to meet up with the bus to leave.

Our frantic ""captain"" told us that the bus was nowhere to be found. It did not appear that she had had as good a time at the rally as most of us. Our group waited in the cold for about an hour, THAT'S WHY!""). What happened next is not 100% clear, but at some point our ""captain"" and three of her companions stormed off the bus and demanded a rental car provided by the people organizing the buses for them to get back home. Apparently there had been more ""discussion"" with some of our bus-mates and she had decided she could not ride 10+ hours in a bus with us anymore.

As a side note, had a flat tire while we were at the rally which they had to get replaced during their ""sleep"" time, and the woman chipped her tooth while eating dinner.

So, exhausting.
