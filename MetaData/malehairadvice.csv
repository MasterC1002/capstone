First of you need to find one of those really fancy drop in ""hairstylist""-studios(I know it's sounds expensive but wait i will explain later). Then one day when buisness is low go down there and look for the absolutely hottest hairstylist around and schedule an appointment.

the reason why you should go to one of these fancy smacy ""hairstylists"" is because they know exactly which haircut who works with your features and conditions. Anyway

When you're done and pleased with your haircut take a shit load of pictures of it from all possible angles. Then in the future you can go the the cheapest and shittiest place you want and show them all the pictures of your hair and they will reassemble your haircut once more.

1345281171.0,yf7x3,The Thorough Guide to Hairstyling: Part 2: Types of Products,Snake_N_Bake,92,22,11,"**Overview of product types and their (typical) hold

* **Gel**: High hold, giving a very firm-holding wet look. Your hair, however, will be rather on the brittle-feeling side, kind of crunchy, even with high-quality gels. Works well for very sleek and controlled looks, but I personally find the texture problematic, but I’ve had limited success with this myself. **Glue** is a stronger variant of gel, and oftentimes with less shine than gel (though sometimes even more

* **Old-Style Pomade**: High to super-high hold, beeswaxy texture but remains somewhat pliable. Old-style Pomades includes stuff like Murray’s, Mr. Ducktail, and about a million others. There’s really a whole culture around all the different kinds, and each offers something a little bit different, so the typical traits of a pomade can vary enormously, and some even offer a matte finish. Generally, they are excellent for very sleek, like pompadours and rockabilly styles. Very hard to wash out, that there is a ridiculous amount of variety in these products. If you wish to delve further into pomade

* **New Pomade**: High shine, Axe, Hanz De Fuko, etc., and are pretty much universally water-based and water-soluble. These are meant to emulate the malleable-texture and high-shine properties of traditional pomades, but without the at times overwhelming greasiness and the tendency to be impossible to wash out. They lose something in the process, however, and are therefore not really suitable for the rockabilly styles of traditional pomades. What they are useful for is adding shine to a look that doesn’t need much hold at all

* **Cream**: Medium hold and Shine, largely because it might seem like they aren’t doing anything depending on the amount you use and your hair type. And for certain very product-resistant hairtypes, creams can indeed end up ineffective, or you’ll end up having to use tons to have any effect. For the hair types that benefit from a cream, though, you can expect to add thickness, a smooth and fairly natural texture, and some level of control. They also provide a good amount of moisture retention

* **Wax**: High hold, and often with a dry feel. Generally used to achieve styles with a dry look and fairly natural texture but a more styled shape. Offers a lot of control while remaining adjustable throughout the day. Only real issue is that some waxes can be very hard and difficult to evenly distribute on your hands and into  your hair, so if you plan to use wax be extra careful that you’ve emulsified it on your hands properly before putting it in your hair. The last thing worth noting is that waxes also come in stick form, which allows you to apply it to your hair much like using a glue stick. I don’t really have much experience with these, and don’t really intend to gain any more at the moment, but their primary use is in applying wax to long hairstyles more easily.

* **Hairspray**: Typically high hold, kind of like a lacquer for your hair. In my experience it offers relatively little in the way of styling versatility in shorter hair (which is most men’s hair), and I personally do not have experience using it in longer hair. Mostly useful for when you’re using something like a light cream and you want to maintain the natural look the cream provides while making the hairstyle more durable and long-lasting.

* **Mousse**: Variable shine but typically low, something you add to your hair while it’s wet to enhance its basic qualities without actually styling it. A typical way to use mouse is to get some in your hands and then rub it into your wet hair and scalp, making sure to apply it evenly to the roots and strands of your hair, then blow-drying to achieve a look with a lot of volume but otherwise natural properties. Better for long hair than short hair, but useful in both.

* **Powder**: An interesting little oddity in the hairstyling world, allowing you to achieve natural-looking vertical styles without the hardness or locked-in nature of a gel or glue. Very good as a prepping product to add some character and size to your hair before styling with other products, and a lot of fun to play around with.

* **Grooming Spray, any liquid product you put into your hair that is not traditional hairspray. These are typically used like leave-in conditioners, and will provide moisture, a small bit of healthy shine, protection when blow-drying or straightening, and lubrication for helping heavier styling products to adhere evenly. They can also work very well on their own for natural looks. A good example, since this category is a bit vaguer, which works as described above. Some of these products do offer more hold and shine

* **Clay**: Basically, that’s about it. Yes, it often does include actual clay, but it performs just like a wax in nine cases out of ten. It’s typically a term to denote wax-type products which are even higher hold and will provide a low-medium shine rather than a matte finish, but this is not always the case, so do your research before buying. These can be very, very hard and dry, however

* **Mud**: Same deal as ‘clay’ in terms of naming, and I can’t evaluate the Sebastian product because I haven’t used it, but you really have no idea what you’re getting in terms of hold, shine, or texture, and so it’s a big gamble for you as a consumer. If you’re willing to risk it, go ahead, however, well

* **Anything Else**: If you come across any other products that don’t have one of these names, let me know and I’ll try to find out what I can about its actual properties, and I may even try it out myself if it sounds interesting enough. Good stuff!

**Introduction and my philosophy**

This thread is meant to be a general introduction to hair products and styling, and which I see pop-up on this reddit regularly. I will also review, and in some cases recommend, the products that I have used, as well as talk about the way each product affects my own hair type (Fine strands, slightly curly with some poofiness, and in great abundance). 

I’ll also talk briefly about my overall way of thinking about styling, when it comes to styling their hair, the first thing most men do is look at celebrities, and decide whose hair they’d like to imitate, and I feel like that’s a fundamentally flawed way of going about styling. Styling is about taking an honest look at yourself and your own hair, figuring out what will actually work for you, and what your hair is capable of. 

It’s about exploration, but do try to not get dead-set on a single specific style you simply may never be able to pull off. It won’t help you look better, it won’t do your confidence any good, and it’s just no fun. :) Which leads me to…
	
What I will not do in this guide:

* Talk about shampoo and conditioner

* Tell you how you can achieve a Ryan Gosling or David Beckham or any other celebrity’s hairstyle

* Review products by request or allow products to be sent to me for review, but this will remain my choice.

What I might do in this thread later on:

* Post pictures of my hair if people are really, I don’t think that’s the point of this thread. This is about teaching you the basics so that you can play around with your own hair and explore what works for you. And besides, right now I’m in the process of growing my hair out after an unfortunately disastrous cut, so it’s not really at its best. :P

* Post videos of how I apply various products, and there is already an abundance of hair styling videos on Youtube.

* Try out a new type of product (but not a specific brand) if I have somehow omitted what enough people feel is a significant category.

* Give you specific product recommendations based on what you’re looking for. I’d rather not get in the habit of doing this

**What Products Actually DO (it’s all about Hold

Very briefly

First, simply put, marketing. Hanz de Fuko is guilty of this with product names like Quicksand and Spongewax, bumble and bumble does it with their sumotech, and American Crew gets into it with their Fiber, their molding clay, grooming vs forming creams, and this overblown marketing jargon is a big reason why getting into hair products can be so intimidating

When it comes to products

* **Hold**:

Quite simply the ability of the product to hold hair in a certain configuration. Medium hold is generally for looser, and can easily cause your hair to give the impression of being over-styled if you’re not careful. It’s worth nothing, however, that these statements of hold are not strictly enforced, and **your mileage will absolutely vary**, especially from one line’s products to the next. What for some companies is high hold can sometimes be more like a high-medium, or even a flat-out medium, so there will be variation within the categories. Also, and benefit from their looser hold. But

	
* **Shine**: 

This aspect has a wider range than hold, and high varieties. High shine is your basic gel or old-style pomade, Mad Men (or in some unfortunate cases, Jersey Shore) hair, very sleek and styled. This can be a very striking look, but if you can’t pull it off your hair will come off as over-styled, and you WILL look silly at best, so be cautious about high-shine products. That’s not to say they have no place
	
Medium shine is more versatile, a semi-formal look that isn’t as overwhelming as a high-shine look has the potential to become. The main factor to keep in mind with medium-shine products is that the level of shine you get tends to depend more heavily on how much product you use than a high-shine or low-shine product, which tend to stick more closely to the label. You can get a surprisingly high shine out of medium-shine products if you really glob it on, and you can also achieve a low-shine look if you use only a little. This means that with medium shine products, experimentation is key, so that you can get a feel for how much product to use for the level of shine you want.
	
Finally, and subdued. This is also where things get a bit tricky, because there is a lot of overlap between products marketed as low-shine and products marketed as **matte**. Matte is, essentially, a dry look with as little shine as possible, meant to be even closer to a natural look. Matte is also very popular at the moment, as it can work in a variety of settings ranging from casual to formal, such as American Crew Fiber, there’s nothing wrong with a low-shine product, I do have some recommendations
	
* **Texture**:

The third major aspect of a product's effects.This is, necessarily) of hold it provides. This is relatively under-discussed, and most product brands will have clear labels for shine and hold, but little if anything for texture (and what is there is often marketing fluff, like ‘provides luscious texture!’ etc.). There is some good reason for this, however, as the exact **visual** texture that a product will create depends greatly upon your own hair, however, from greasy and slick to gummy, but the main point I want to get across here is that the texture of your hair is just as important as the appearance

1368957069.0,1emhkh,[Guide] Styling Your Bangs Up or Textured Top Hair (x-post /r/malefashionadvice),sawedust,57,8,11,"A lot of posts lately have been asking about finding a shorter

What I haven't seen is a specific guide aimed at finding

Often times when leaving the house

But in only a few hours

You've tried a whole lot of products, still falls flat. Try a different product, mix two products together... everything you've tried ends up with your hair falling flat in a few hours.

Wouldn't it be nice to have great hold throughout the day and even when you wake up the next morning?

Here's how to do it in three simple steps.

**Step One: Find the proper cut that you like.**

It's important you find something that YOU like. After all it's your hair

[Here's the bangs up album.](http://imgur.com/a/hxK1U)

[And the textured tops album.](http://imgur.com/a/KhZGa)

*Find three hairstyles* in those albums with a model who closely resembles your own face shape. A lot of people get too carried away with what haircut goes with what face shape

*Save those pictures* by either printing them, any method that will let you show it to your stylist or barber. I prefer going to a stylist for a textured look; most barbers I go to only have razors, buzzers and regular shears, no texturing shears. Your experiences may vary.

*Ask your stylist* which of the three looks he or she thinks will work best for you. Don't worry about the specifics of the cut

**Step Two: Styling Your Hair**

Now that you have the right cut

*Wash your hair* in your usual manner. Personally

[Hair has been towel dried. Note that my hair is still a little wet and the way it falls flat on my head.](http://i.imgur.com/alnsK3J.jpg)

The next step is the key to having great hold throughout the day: *blow dry your hair*. This may take a few extra minutes

A lot of people keep looking for the product with the most hold, mud, paste, pomade, cream, gel, whatever, not the main dish
 
Style your hair the way you want with one hand while blow drying with the other. Push it up, whatever. Use a comb or a brush if you need to. [A concentrator attachment](http://i.imgur.com/yG25XRO.png) on your blow dryer to help direct airflow will definitely help in this area. Use the highest heat that you can handle. Don't worry about damaging your hair; if you're getting your hair cut every month, every two months, even every six months your hair won't get damaged before it's cut anyway.

[*Keep drying your hair until it's molded the way you want*.](http://i.imgur.com/GIQz22d.jpg) If done right, you've already achieved more lock than you did trying all the different products on their own.

**Step Three: Adding Product**

Here's where adding product comes into play. The cake and ice cream after the steak and lobster. The styling guide mentioned earlier discussed how to [either cocktail or layer your products](http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf85q/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_3_applying/). What you choose is up to you

The products that I use post-blow drying are [Lanza's Texturizing Powder](http://www.amazon.com/Lanza-Healing-Powder-Texturizer-Unisex/dp/B002CXPO7W) and [Gatsby Wild Shake Moving Rubber](http://www.amazon.com/GATSBY-MOVING-RUBBER-SHAKE-2-8oz/dp/B000V2ACHI).

A lot of people use American Crew products, but I prefer the matte look.

The texturizing powder helps to give hair a rougher, straight Asian hair like me. A few sprinkles is usually enough. Massage the powder into the hair and use it to reinforce your style.

From here

[Hair is done and good to go.](http://i.imgur.com/sPRiy5k.jpg)

**Step Four: Ready

Now that you have your hair styled and set

**First, I will not be teaching you how to style your hair like a celebrity, or like any models or pictures you see, for that matter. Your hair is yours, it’s not like anybody else’s, and you will only do yourself a disservice and become frustrated if you try to make your hair into something it simply cannot be. 

If you do want advice about that, which is all fine and good and that’s how most people start out. But I think that it’s important to take advantage of the natural features of your hair, and work with its quirks and oddities, because that is what will allow you to create a unique look that is truly all your own. 

Sure, it’s uncreative, and it’ll show that you don’t have confidence in your own ability to find a style that works for you. 

So I encourage you, and play around. Start with a little bit, make sure you distribute it evenly, and just poke and prod, shove it around, try different things, and have fun with your hair. It’s liberating, and you’ll discover exactly what your hair is capable of

**Now

First things first, because otherwise your hair just won’t cooperate as well and you simply will not get the proper control over your hair or be able to really figure out what the product is capable of. Once your hair is clean, you’ve got a few options on how you want to apply your products. I’ll start from the most simple, beginner-friendly methods, and later go up to something a little bit more advanced for those who want some more room to experiment with.

For those who are new to hair products, however, that a product’s exact effects depend on how wet or dry your hair is when you put them in, so feel free to experiment day-to-day with different levels of moisture once you’re more comfortable. 

Besides that, but don’t be afraid to rinse your hair out and re-dry it if you accidentally add too much. I recommend starting with a pea-sized amount of most products, especially if you have very short hair, and then working your way up until you find your preferred amount.

* **For Beginners:**

In terms of actually styling your hair, curling irons, three kinds of combs and half a dozen different products to make a giant tower of hair, but now’s really not the time for that. Just spread a pea-sized amount of product evenly on your palms and fingers, and then just run your fingers through your hair as thoroughly as possible, your goal being to make sure the roots and strands each get their fair share of product.

During this stage, and working toward the front and sides. This is because it’s very common when you’re starting out to only think about how the front of your hair looks, and just obsess and obsess about it, not realizing that the rest of your head is totally neglected. This is also why most people end up using way too much product, they start at the front and just glob it on, and they can’t get it to distribute properly. 

Think of it like shampooing: you want to make sure the product is thoroughly distributed, and then turn around and see what you’ve ended up with.

This is usually a pretty good indication of what your hair is naturally going to want to do, etc.) while being confident that your hair will hold its shape because you’re not forcing it to do what it doesn’t really want to.

* **For The Slightly More Advanced:**

Two of the most important techniques if you want to get a bit fancier with your hairstyling are **layering your products and cocktailing your products**. These are fairly similar concepts

* **Cocktailing** is really the simpler of the two

One lesson, pair a firmer-holding wax with just a small amount of cream or new-style pomade to add a healthy shine to a more controlled hairstyle. This can also be fun because the texturizing effects of the two products will combine, leading to some really interesting stuff. 

As an example, soft, and pliable, and I have yet to find any single product which gives me quite the same feel.

* **Layering** is a bit more complex, however, is that you can likewise achieve more complex styles, and you will have vastly more control over your hair. At a basic level, it just goes like this: add one product to achieve one effect, then add another on top that you feel complements it (but might not work in a cocktail).
 
For example, that sort of thing, to provide volume or moisture then following it up with a stronger hold product. You wouldn’t be able to cocktail mousse or the B&amp;B products because they’re so different in terms of application method from standard ‘puck’ products.  

Same thing with a hairspray, but it wouldn’t get the effect you want in all likelihood). There really isn’t a specific order you have to use products in when layering, however, so there’s a lot of freedom here, though it can take a while to learn what works for you. 

Another subset of layering that you’ll see more often in Rockabilly styles and pompadours is the use of a “topcoat”, typically by just moving your hands flatly across your head front-to-back.

Well personally I think my face shape is either oval or round

[[1] “What’s my faceshape?” A quick guide to face shapes](http://musicreviewunsigned.com/2013/04/24/whats-my-faceshape-a-quick-guide-to-face-shapes/)

-Hey

*""Round:
If you have a round face

-That's true, my shape is **round**. But let me be sure and check next link in google.

[[2] The Make-up Chair: Face Shape!](http://themakeupchair.blogspot.sk/2012/09/face-shape.html)

-Hmm, face shape is unisex right? Let me skip to round shape:

""*The easiest way to describe a round face is take a oval and pull it outwards.*"" -Yeah? U don't say... say by how much!

""*The face is the same full across as its length is down.* "" - Maybe I don't know english so well, but probability is less right? ""*As you can see here on Kirsten Dunst - her cheeks are the same fullness from her round forehead to her jawline creating an almost prefect circle.*"" -M'kay let me verify this statement. - [Yup, it's true](http://i.imgur.com/y5Fhbad.jpg), let me compare it with me. - [Nope](http://i.imgur.com/IPyLHPN.jpg). Ok, so my face shape isn't round after all :( Let me see other options:

- Oval - ""*Oval Faces are known for their symmetrical balanced features because of this oval (or egg shape) has became the most sort after shape.*"" -My jaw is certainly more pointy than top of my head so it's not symmetrical so then I'm not oval.

- Oblong/Long - ""*Both shapes are elongated ovals

- Square ""*chin is flat*"" - certainly not me. It's not flat

- Rectangle - ""*rectangle is longer then it is wide but still the forehead is flat on top and squares off

- Heart Shaped
They can also have a widows peek but most a rounded forehead is what sets is apart from an inverted triangle.*"" - I'm not sure what they mean with pixie like tapered jaw

- Triangle/Pear - ""*face is much fuller at the jawline then the forehead*"" - Nope

- Diamond - ""*Another unusually shape and often mistaken for oval. Diamond is fullest at the cheeks and tapered above and below. Creating a diamond shape. The fullest can be across the cheeks or across the cheekbone

[\[3\] How To: Find Your Face Shape](http://www.herstyleblog.com/post/18136037982/how-to-find-your-face-shape) - Holy shit

- Oval - ""*shape is proportional in length and width (about 1.5 times longer than it is wide), it's 10 vs 7 units, I guess we can consider it as about 1.5 rate - and it's just in photo, in real I have pretty big nose, so it adds to length! And if my chin is slightly narrower than forehead? Yeah sure it is baby! Let me check diamond shape and if it's description would not describe my shape, we have new winner! Also that drawing looks like my shape! ... wait a minute? B-b-but drawing of oval shape is much different than [drawing in first result](http://musicreviewunsigned.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/xaXz7Yra8j1BCQ0SOLoDErbz-300x243.jpeg)! ... [WTF!?](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/desk-flip-240x180.png) OKAY, let's try to preserve logic. This drawing looks most like round shape in first result and according it's description in first result my shape IS round. Also, this article must be bullshit! YEAH

1 - Basic Hairstyling Implements

* [Gel](http://imgur.com/mc3Zu) 

* [Wax](http://imgur.com/fpEmc)

* [Clay](http://imgur.com/g5nxp)

* [Spray](http://i.imgur.com/U1EFc.jpg)

2 - Advanced Hairstyling Implements

* Hair Iron(image to be uploaded)

* Hair Straightener(image to be uploaded)

* Comb

Let's get straight to the point now. I will be brief and update this post from time to time if it need be.


Gel

&gt;Short
Provide a quick fix and look neat and smart


Wax

&gt;Short
Allow more 'fun' in your styles


Hard Clay

&gt;Medium Length
Use for 'enhancing' the style you want


Molding Clay

&gt;Medium to Long hair
Acts pretty much like wax


Spray

&gt;All hair lengths
This little thing is really good as it acts as a finisher for everything. Sets the style for long-lasting effects.

1345284218.0,yf90n,The Thorough Guide to Hairstyling: Part 4: Product Reviews,Snake_N_Bake,46,8,9,"**Specific Product Reviews**

This section is pretty straight-forward, usually taken from the jar itself or their website, to provide context for my own experience with the product. 

Following that, texturizing effects, and smell. I should make it clear right now that I have NOT been paid by any brands or companies to endorse their products. None of my products were received for free, I either bought them myself or my family members bought them for me at some point. I am not against receiving promotional product samples, but I doubt any companies even know I exist, so I won’t hold my breath. :P EDIT: For reference, my hair is moderately curly/wavy

One last thing before I begin: there are many good lines of products, but it’s more of a hair care product than a styling product), Moroccanoil, KMS California, Johnny B., and Kevin Murphy.** Generally speaking, you will find quality products in these lines, don’t be afraid that they’re not as good as what I’m reviewing here. Anyways

**American Crew Pomade:**

Brand Description: “Medium hold with high shine. Works well for curly hair and provides a modern

My ratings:

Hold: Low

Shine: High

Texture: Greasy

Smell: Musky, but not overpowering. As long as you’re not using too much of it, a very nice smell.

My overall thoughts: Well, and still one I keep in my cabinet now. A good example of modern-style pomades, this product gives you a tremendous amount of shine and a very wet, soft look. It feels a little bit greasy, but it washes out quite easily, and won’t leave any undesired residue in your hair. All in all, it is a quality product. I do, have my gripes with it. It says medium hold, I recommend it

How I use it: I usually prefer to apply this to dry or very slightly moist hair, which it does a rather good job of. I won’t typically finish with any hairsprays, since if I’m using the pomade on its own I want a light-hold style, and hairspray would undo that.  If I want something a bit more interesting, I’ll cocktail the pomade with Hanz de Fuko Quicksand or American Crew Forming Cream to provide more hold and thickness, which the pomade lacks. 

**American Crew Forming Cream:**

Brand Description: “Medium hold with medium shine. Easy to use styling cream works well for all hair types. Forming cream provides hold
My ratings/Experience:

Hold: medium-high (can become surprisingly firm if you use a lot

Shine: Medium

Texture: A bit sticky at first, really. Leaves a nice smooth texture in the hair, very pliable.

Smell: Coconuty and a bit medicinal. Less conventionally masculine than the AC Pomade

My overall thoughts: An excellent product, and control to your hair, it applies evenly without much hassle, and will last most of the day. You can also add quite a bit more and really strengthen the hold, and I would argue that this actually holds better than the Fiber if you use enough, because it sticks to your hair much more firmly. This stuff is really just great, and the description by Crew themselves is quite accurate

How I use it: Apply to slightly damp hair, however, that this stickyness isn’t a problem once the product has sat in your hair for just a little while, so it’s only really an issue if you’re trying to get this into dry hair. It will, however, still work with dry hair, so feel free to try it; damp hair is just my preference. Finally, and works very well in combination with the AC Pomade, so use it sparingly until you find the right amount.

**American Crew Fiber:**

Brand Description: “High hold with low shine. Fiber-like, pliable hold with a matte finish. Works well in shorter hair, 1-3 inches in length.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: Medium

Shine: Low

Texture: Hard and dry

Smell: Super-citrusy, though.

My Overall Thoughts: 
Really more of a medium hold, however. It starts of quite strong, when first applying, and can actually be a little bit difficult to apply at times because of this. Once it sits in your hair for 5-10 minutes, however, the product softens up tremendously, and your hair becomes very soft and moveable. It will stay held where it is, for the most part, more humid climate
In terms of shine, though, you should apply the product to dry hair. If you apply it to wet hair, you’ll lock in some of the moisture, giving a slight amount of shine.
In terms of texture effects, but this isn’t really a selling point for this product as other products can do the same things better. Still, not a bad feature, and if you’d rather stick to only one product it comes in handy.

How I Use It: Apply to completely dried hair, so I just use it for more unstructured, casual looks.

**American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel:**

Brand Description: “Non-flaking formula. Firm Hold Styling Gel

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: High

Shine: Medium/High

Texture: Typical gel “wet-look.” For my hair

Smell: Subtle

My Overall Thoughts:
A mixed product. If you want a gel look, and if I applied the gel to dry hair it seemed to make my hair frizz out without providing any real hold. There’s no denying that this is a quality product, but it just does not work for me or what I like when it comes to my hair.

How I Use It: I tried the typical slicked-back looks, depending what kind of feel you want. It’s not really my thing, but it does what it does well.

The one method I did enjoy was slicking my hair back while wet, and once all the crustiness was combed out my hair was excellent to play with. But most mornings I simply don’t have time to wait and have my hair air-dry and then re-style it before I leave. And for some reason, blow-drying instead of air-drying always got rid of the straightening/malleable effect I liked and went back to frizzy.",,False,self,t5_2s1me,,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf90n/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_4_product/

Brand Description: “This nutrient-rich detangler reveals texture

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: None

Shine: None

Texture: Helps make my hair super smooth and soft

Smell: Mild herbal/medicinal smell

My Overall Thoughts:
A soft-spoken essential for me. Makes my hair wonderfully smooth and controlled without doing anything that would mess up styling later. Just a note, but could use a little extra detangling and moisture.

How I Use It:
I usually use it when my hair is damp, and then style with whatever products I would use normally.

**Keune Man Matte Effect:**

Brand Description: “Matte &amp; dry clay for strong definition in short to medium hair.”

My Ratings/Experience: 

Hold: High.

Shine: Low

Texture: Excellent

Smell: Sharp and masculine, and some minty/menthol kick. Great stuff.

My Overall Thoughts:
An excellent product in almost every sense. It does what it says it will, not horrendous, but a bit higher than I think most would be willing to pay.
	
One note on the fact that it’s a “clay” – this is one clay that is actually fairly different from most of the waxes I’ve used. It’s much more solid, though, and only a little bit of stickiness to hold it all together.

How I Use It:
Same way as Fiber, it’ll be difficult to distribute it evenly and could make your hair quite difficult to work with due to its high hold, so apply it in stages and take your time. This stuff has some fiercely good hold while remaining malleable, possibly the highest hold I’ve found in a malleable wax/clay, so it works well for styles with a good amount of height. Only problem is that its texture makes it trickier to apply to longer hair (anything above 5-6 inches), so if your hair is that long I’d recommend using it as a topcoat or cocktailing it with something like a cream or a lighter wax to make applying it easier.

**Hanz de Fuko Scheme Cream:**

**Important note: this review is of the old Scheme Cream formula

Brand Description: “Ingenious

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: Light/medium

Shine: Low/natural

Texture: Seems to help define curls quite well

Smell: Light and sweet

My Overall Thoughts: 
Superb, so if you’ve got fine hair, especially curly hair, this stuff is a miracle. Even on the hottest, muggiest days, this stuff doesn’t make my hair droop at all, and it always lets my scalp breathe quite well.

How I Use It: 
There are two primary ways I use it. Method one is to apply a fingertip to damp hair
	
Method two involves blow-drying the hair first to give it some good volume, but needs a bit of moisture and hold to be at its best. Kind of works like a leave-in conditioner, in a way.

**Hand de Fuko Quicksand:**

Brand Description: “Revolutionary! Add volume

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: High

Shine: Non-existent. This is pure matte

Texture: Wow, but you can always cocktail to get that, and this is probably the most cocktail-able product there is. It does leave your hair with a gritty feeling, kind of like you’ve just been swimming in the ocean, but it remains malleable all the same, and I actually kind of like it.

Smell: Dusty, but stays relatively mild.

My Overall Thoughts:
This is the one product on this list that I will say absolutely everybody with an interest in styling their hair should try. Simply the most unique product I have ever used, and some may not like the feel. But this product is one-of-a-kind, so it’s worth a try at least once. As a plus, it's a powder-in-cream product, so the cream side of it helps it distribute really, really easily.

How I Use It:
If I want a lot of thickness, and the cocktail of this + AC Pomade is possibly my favorite thing for my hair. Definitely worth a try, and you can adjust the ratio of Quicksand to Pomade depending on how much shine you want. Also cocktails quite well with Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax. As a side note, my girlfriend also loves using this for shagging out her hair, so if you’re interested in that, this is a good choice.

**Hanz de Fuko Hybridized Wax:**

Brand Description: “Wildly Inventive! Water based styling wax with custom blended polymers to provide maximum separation

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: Medium-high

Shine: Medium

Texture: Super-smooth

Smell: Smells like eucalyptus. Weird

My Overall Thoughts:
A fun and under-rated product. Most HdF buzz focuses on Quicksand, but this product is quite remarkable. It’s extremely lightweight, much like Scheme Cream, but provides a good level of shine. And honestly, at least for my hair (light brown with notes of red and blond), this stuff has the perfect level of shine. Enough to make my hair a bit more interesting, but never enough to make it look greasy.

How I Use It: 
I like to apply this to dry hair, overall, especially since most products that give shine tend to be a lot heavier or greasier.

**Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax:**

Brand Description: “The best wax formulation for achieving the perfect balance of flexibility and firmness with a great matte finish. Unique ingredients combine for limitless styling creativity with long-lasting

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: High

Shine: Low. Not quite matte

Texture: Great texturizer
Smell: Scheme Cream without the peaches

My Overall Thoughts:
Top-notch wax, but remains very malleable, so you can use this stuff to get your hair in a style that’ll hold through wind and heat, but adjust easily if you want to re-style it yourself.
How I Use It:
	
I prefer to use this stuff on dry hair on its own, so I can style in a few seconds flat and get a very nice look.

Try to figure out what [shape your face](http://thepageantplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Face-Shapes-11.jpg) falls under. You can use that to help you find a style that will suit you

I like to keep a conversation going with the person cutting my hair. Don't be an awkward penguin. Holding a conversation with your stylist is nice because this could be a person you come back to for repeated haircuts

Pay attention to what's going on while your hair is in the process of being cut.  If you feel like something isn't right don't be afraid to speak up. Likewise if the stylist has finished don't be afraid to say something if you don't like it. Oftentimes she can modify or fix something what's bothering you

- draw attention away from large nose

Usually, and Royal Crown...because, well, they've been doing this for decades (some nearing a century). I don't feel the need or ever intend revive a dead age/culture or refer to myself as a rockabilly at all...I simply appreciate an earlier age when men were clean cut &amp; combed, straight razors from barbers were a standard, and women had not yet defined the ideal man in the 'fashion' world. E.g. [me(right) &amp; homie (left)](http://i.imgur.com/EzuCw.jpg).

I'm typically an adamant user of oil-based pomades...but honestly, it's like 'Fuhhhh...dis shits all over my shirt collar'. 

So, it had the consistency of grape jelly and was pretty sticky. 

Before I continue

As for using the product itself, and water-based so I can wash it off at night and save some pillow cases. The only two things I don't like...it doesn't have any shine which was something I really liked about grease. And it doesn't have that slick sticky-ness that keeps ALL stray hairs perfectly together. But all-in-all, I'm happy with it.

Also, a cheap boar brush, and Suavecito. Sidenote: water-based pomades in general are much more expensive than traditional oil-based pomades because they use a lot more non-standard chemicals. Essentially, you can make grease pomade at home (I intend to do that soon).

I have noticed a common request


I replied to a thread in MFA asking for similar styling advice

I am going to paste the bulk of that here. 

[Here I am.](http://i.imgur.com/agWr4.jpg) I just got back from the beach

It is a ton of work. More than you expect

It is way way longer than it looks, my hair stylist is dope. He is awesome at knowing what I want. The hardest part is finding someone skilled enough to not mess it up. It is kind of a weird cut, you would have to really know what you are doing. 


For example- the very middle of my hair is long



In the shower I use shampoo maybe once every 10 days


Then I blowdry my hair. Then I put Paul Mitchell Extra Body Mousse in. Then I blowdry it again. Then I use Aveda Grooming Clay. Then Aussi Instant Freeze Hairspray. This adds up. Including hair cuts I am sure I average $60 a month on my hair.

The whole day my hair is slowly falling down

I also slept with my hair slicked back and a beanie on for quite a while until it got long enough.


Even though some days(and weeks) I crave having a shaved head I always end up keeping my hair.

At first the guy hadn't buzzed the back at all, and made it into a sort of V shape, looking like some sort of mullet updated for the hypebeast generation. I told him it was supposed to be round at the back, so he did that. Then I asked him to buzz it a bit higher up, and he said he couldn't because it would look strange. He said he shouldn't go any higher than he had it. I didn't have any pictures with me showing an undercut from behind so I took his word even though I was really skeptical.

basically people with better hairlines such as zac efron (depicted above by my awesome paint skills) can pull of any hairstyle

I see people posting zac efron/model hair cuts where the hair wouldn't even come out that far on the persons head so the haircut isn't possible and would look ridiculous.

look for hair which is similar to the posters and see what they do with their hair to make it look good.

The inherent problem with those hairstyles on me is that I have a face like [this](http://imgur.com/oG9Bl)

So my entire life I've been this half-asian white kid with asian hair and a white face - people don't recognize me as asian at all until I tell them my name, but now that I'm in college I'm having some serious problems finding a hairstyle that will suit me and not look ridiculous.

Here are some pics, [the short asian hair](http://imgur.com/botwu).

[Side](http://imgur.com/jD5ZK)

One of the biggest problems with growing my hair out initially is that the back gets really thick and long, and getting rid of it is a pain, and I don't know how to deal with it.

Anyways, whether it's different haircuts, styling products and advice, or just tips in general, you'd be helping me more than you can imagine.
