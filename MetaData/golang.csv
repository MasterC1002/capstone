**Update 2**: Well it turns out I wasn't able to get nginx to work with sockets after all.  nginx does have the http version switch but even when used the Connection and Update headers are getting dropped on the request

**Update 3**: I updated the app to randomly generate and delete boxes

**Update 4**: updated the render to use KineticJS instead of a homegrown.  I've really like KineticJS for adding event handling to the objects, if the item actual existed.

**Update 5**: Added better client side rendering, and removing a block.  Hit boxes after that.",,False,,t5_2rc7j,True,,

There's a few subprojects that are really important:

* http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/gopacket/pcap - libpcap cgo bindings
* http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/gopacket/pfring - PF_RING cgo bindings

This project was forked from https://github.com/akrennmair/gopcap as a more extensible method of decoding that was much simpler to add new protocol decoders to.  Among other features

* Lazy packet decoding - only decode layers when they're requested
* Modifiable decoding rules - you can easily override any decoder or set of decoders, while keeping the rest of the decoding chain intact
* Extensible - easy to add new decoders.  You can even plug in new decoders without modifying the gopacket code,False,,t5_2rc7j,False,,,t3_174s3e

/models
/server.js

There is a separate file under /routes for each segment of the application. Ex. /users

Models has data objects and database access.

Views has the HTML templates.

A number of pull requests later

In a similar vein I'm very confused by the results for Go - it has some of the lowest latency of all of the tested languages/frameworks but simultaneously the worst throughput in the database test(s). Is this purely a reflection of Go's immature database layer or is something else I don't understand at work here?

Import it along with the standard log package like so:

You can then use the functions log.Debug, etc, etc. I included support for the log.Print, log.Println, and log.Printf style outputs.

However the section suggests that you can also use goroutines to achieve parallelism by calling

    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.NumCPU())

which

That's great (and really nifty) but I can't help but wonder why it isn't simply on by default? From the description it sounds like it works out of the box without any major concerns.

Hello everyone. I've written my [first golang program](https://github.com/roberttstephens/webanalytics) and am interested to get some feedback from folks that know go. 

My goal is to create a simple and efficient open source program to gather web analytics. The program should gather data to help answer the following questions.

* How frequently does http://www.example.com/page1 get viewed? (Sometimes it's difficult to tell with varnish)
* What percentage of users are still on IE-8?
* Which content do users click on?

Right now

For page views I'm recording:

* timestamp
* URL
* Ip address
* user agent
* screen height
* screen width

For href clicks I'm recording:

* timestamp
* URL (the page they're on when they clicked a link)
* ip address
* href value (the page they're about to visit)
* href rectangle (Work in progress) 

The href rectangle probably won't work correctly right now, y coordinates with the screen height should provide the data to determine in which areas content is clicked.

Would anyone be able to help with the following questions?

* What other data should be gathered?
* How could the program be improved? (Using go conventions
* What could be done to make the program (either the code or concept) easier to understand?

Any other advice is appreciated. Thanks everyone!

Greetings everyone

I've got a problem with **Go** on Windows 7 (x64) and was wondering if anyone can help me?

After building with *go build ...* I get the correct output file. (*.exe) The new executable can be run


I first noticed the problem in **LiteIDE**

But I tested it by building manually:

* The file can't be removed in explorer.
* The file can't be edited.
* The file CAN be run.
* Rebuilding gives: *Access is denied.*
* Right mouse shows the admin required icon for rename/delete

Now the strange thing it 'reverts' back to a 'normal' file after a short while. It is as if something is still using the file for a short(2-3m) while after a build.

I've tried building executables with **Visual Studio 2008&amp;2010** and they don't have the same problem. (Same with **Java**)

I found one other mention of the problem [on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14511495/go-language-access-is-denied-on-trying-to-go-install)


**Tested:** I've copied my exact directory structure to my other Windows 7(x64) and there it works without problem. So I suspect it is a combination of **go** with something else.

My question is

I'm not sure if this is the proper way to go about things though? I'm guessing the immediate suggestion would be to package the application up in a .deb file and let the package manager take care of things - the problem is the runtime lib ```libglfw``` on apt-get is not compatible with the go library ```go-gl/glfw``` as it requires the library to be compiled with a particular target.

I'm having trouble finding what types in the standard library implement what interfaces. 

Here's a little contrived webserver handler function. Let's say I want to store http requests

    func handler(w http.ResponseWriter
    
      requestStorage := new(bytes.Buffer)
      err := r.Write(requestStorage) // Ignore err in example
    
      recreatedRequest
     
    }

I'm writing the request to a bytes buffer

First thing's first: We look at the http library docs to find out how to [write the http Request](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request.Write):

    func (r *Request) Write(w io.Writer) error 

Looks like that will fit the bill! Ok

What does? Well

    A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Read and Write methods.

Baboom! It has a Write method! So it implements io.Writer... Right? I guess?

Ok

    func NewReader(rd io.Reader) *Reader
    NewReader returns a new Reader whose buffer has the default size. 

Perfect! I just need to give it an [io.Reader](http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader). 

    Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method. 

bytes.Buffer does implement a Read method. So

----

Now

    All Implemented Interfaces:
    Serializable, Collection&lt;E&gt;, Set&lt;E&gt;

Right away

Now

Has anyone else run into this problem? Am I missing something? Is it wrong to think that http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader should link to types in the standard lib that implement that interface?

* What sort of performance issues might I encounter?  [This thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/2itG-u8RfJU) seems to indicate that cgo performance might be a bit lacking
