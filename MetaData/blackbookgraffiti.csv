Sketching is awesome. It helps you learn things about letter forms, legal, and can lead to learning other forms of drawn art as well. It's where 99% of modern writers got their start, and it will always be a hugely important to the culture. 

However... 

**GO PAINT.** Do it. If you don't want to or can't go out and do it the old fashioned way, and will teach you so much more about the art form. I will guarantee that a week after you start painting, your sketches will look better. You will start to transfer stuff back and forth from the book to the wall, and your style will develop at a quicker rate. 

Remember: You can sketch and be awesome and all that in a book

[First off I try to make fast

Now the idea isn't to make it perfect, then gradually move faster when I'm getting warmer.

[The second step is to make 45 degree angles both ways](http://imgur.com/a/cZdFX#1)

After you have done these four variations of lines you will probably notice that one type of line seems straigther than the other. This is either your natural hand movement or close too. If you want to identify your natural hand movement, when you can do it as often as you can to produce nice straight lines)

[The next step is to start making some curves](http://imgur.com/a/cZdFX#2)

[First off they're long and continous

Now the idea of the iteration is to make curves in all sorts of directions

[Then I makes circles within the holes of the first curve](http://imgur.com/a/cZdFX#4)

[The last step is to iterate the circles as well

[Here's my first paper - the one above is the sixth](http://imgur.com/a/cZdFX#6)

Obviously there's a lot of difference between this and the first one. The first thing I thought when I looked at the first paper was 'whoa

____________________________________________________

**Now the pros with this technique are several:**

* It's very space efficient


* Since there are long lines it's hard to do

* It's versatile

* It's kind of fun to make these patterns in my opinion.

* It's fast and serves it purpose of warming your hand up.

* You can analyze the picture and see what curves/lines you screw up and need to work on since it's basically all continous. Of course it's more practial to do this after each step than in the end.

One analysis based on the sixth paper is that my vertical lines are much wavier than my horizontal ones

If you have any questions or suggestions on how I can improve this technique

**TL;DR: A good warm up technique that I've worked out over the last few days,False,self,t5_2sekq,False,,,t3_t55wg

I really like the idea of these monthly battles, and strategies with out feeling pressure from people talking shit. Without me expressing this to anyone you guys have really taken that idea and made it a reality... I love seeing all the 'new to the game' people post

Now about the monthly battles... Can some of you post some ground rules? Make a list of rules that will apply for every month. I will take the rules we agree on (ie: post submissions in that months post.) and put them into the side bar. Also I want to see how big we can get this. If we can get this going solid with a lot of submissions for the rest of the year, do prize ideas you can send to me to... But for me to put up money to give a prize there will need to be some serious submissions. I don't know just thinking. I'm open to ideas, post any rules or prize ideas you might have.
