I asked him why it wasn't allowed on the property and he told me that a pedicabber had removed property from the premises once and that pedicabs hadn't been allowed to park here since. I asked him if all modes of transportation were banned once someone was found stealing. Of course not. Okay then

Now, some Clif bars and a drink and sat with my friend to eat. There was no soliciting. The idea of soliciting had never even entered my mind.

About an hour after I got home

Start getting pissed because I'm going to have to stand in line to get a new drivers license, blah blah. The $600 in cash I had was the least of my worries. 

Decided to call HEB just to see if the off chance someone turned it in.

Turns out

- $600 cash

- Debit and credit cards with enough credit to have a damn nice shopping spree

- Various gift cards

Whoever turned my wallet in

Would love to return the favor

It will take place on or near enough to  a downtown bridge that it will need to be closed.  Beer in plastic cups will be $20.  There will be many small tents selling nothing you have ever wanted aka 'artisan crafts' aka jewelry bought from Native American reservations and resold.  There will be a big radio station sponsored stage featuring a band you've never heard of who's bassist once played in a band that you thing you've heard of either because they might've been famous or more likely 'locally famous' in the late 80's which means the Austin Chronicle will be a sponsor because they are still mad that it is not permanently 1989 in Austin when Daniel Johnson was only haha crazy and not scary humanoid-zeppelin-with-a-broken-control-panel-crazy. Many cops will be hired to stand around looking bored.  Only male cops.  Only the very short barrel-chested ones who either have to be tan or dark-skinned to not get sunburned because they never wear hats no matter how long they stand in the sun.  No one knows why this is.

The word 'Weird' will be printed onto a sticker and plastered onto everything: beer cups, Pepsico schwag, stoner schwag, children under the age of 6 and the expansive bottoms of visitors from Corpus. Periodic announcements will be made over a PA system to let you know what a fun time you are having.  Whenever bands are not playing the local radio station/HEBuddy tent will blast pop music enjoyed only by the most mentally stunted teenagers and/or seasonal residents of West Campus.  Strollers that are bigger than cars are warmly welcomed.  Smaller strollers or baby carrier backpacks are discouraged.  You need to protect your child from events like potential nuclear war at all times.

Do you like Wells Fargo?  We think they're great and just thought you should know every five minutes.

What are we celebrating? Festivals

30, despite the fact that those two cities have a combined population of over 8 million there is nothing to do there unless you want to eat or go to a church with a trendy name like The Grotto (They have A ROCK BAND!).  Somehow, everyone who attends FestivalFest will end up at Home Slice or Guero's afterwards.

Please come to FestivalFest!  We are on a weekend.  We might be on every weekend

See you soon.

I tried to point out that he had his wallet in his pocket

So I asked him where he lived and he told me he lived over on Brentwood by North Lamar. He explained several times he would have taken a cab but he got robbed by his friends. Then he apologized to me for living with his mom

So after I succeeded in convincing him that I wasn't taking him to jail, and pointed behind us while still looking forward. So I turned around, and he pointed out his place. I helped him out of the car and up to the door.

He searched around in his pockets for a minute, and tried to hand it to me saying, ""I got robbed, but I have about $400 left if you want it."". Trying to collect on some good karma, and being a little concerned about where he produced the bills from, I respectfully declined and told him to keep his money. He shoved it back into his shorts and then fiddled around for a bit before stating that he lost his key.

He told me that since he couldn't get in, knocking over a garbage can in front of the house. I wasn't sure what to do, so I knocked on the door and a woman asked who it was. I asked her through the door if she had a son named Dylan, after which she opened the door with haste looking very concerned. I assume she thought I was a police officer also, possibly delivering bad news about her child.

Once she saw I wasn't a cop

I told her that I didn't know her, and she thanked me and said she would appreciate it. So we started walking toward the direction where Dylan had headed. When we got about two blocks down I told her I didn't think he could have made it that far, and we must have missed him.

We started back and I heard a kind of whimpering by her neighbor's house. So we opened the gate and found Dylan crying on the porch seat of the neighbor's house. His mom talked him into getting up and coming home after about 5 minutes, I helped him to the couch and he seemed content.

His mom thanked me again, I saw the dumped out garbage and felt kind of bad about the mom having to deal with it, so I picked up the trash and put it back in the garbage can and set it back up on the curb.

I drove home and washed my hands about 10 times, and the clock was showing 4:12AM. I felt that I was going to regret that shit when I got up for work, but I don't at all. In fact, besides the gross smelling hand, which by the way has finally worn off, it was a pretty interesting night. And I feel like I may have actually saved that guy's life.

**TL;DR - I found a dude lying in an intersection tripping on acid and gave him a ride home. Ended up meeting his mom and picking up trash.**

**Edit: I just wanted to say a couple of things since people have asked me...**

 - I don't know if he was ever actually with his friends or not. That is just what he said. So if any of you are his friends

 - I don't know if he really had $400. He just pulled out a wad of money and said it was about $400. I didn't count it,,False,self,t5_2qhn5,1338585790.0,,True

I just want to say that she was a delight to be around. She loved red wine, marijuana, her shiatsu, summer, stand-up comedy, living in Austin, her friends

The night of the crash, and a few other close friends went to sixth street. Her and the boyfriend decided to go home early. They took the bus home. The last thing he remembers is them being on the bus and talking about how they couldn't wait to get home and go to sleep. Apparently, at the scene, the cops said he had been giving her a piggy back when it happened, and he was holding her in his arms when they arrived. Thankfully, he doesn't remember any of this. I hope for his sanity that he never does. He is okay. We're all making it day by day, but he is physically alright.

She was my best friend. We moved to Austin together. We fought like sisters and loved each other like I'm sure you love your best friend.

It's a long shot, call the APD. 

Also, stop.

Just wanted the rest of you to know that Oltorf around Congress and 1st is getting a little hairy. Dude said I was the second one this month who had gotten mugged in his yard.

And this was on Oltorf. At 11pm. A busy street.

**EDIT**: Thank you all so much for listening and passing the word around. I realize that there is almost a 100% chance that you were no where near the accident and can't really help with information.

A little less than ten years ago, at that point, all I had known of the state so far was a very crappy couple of town surrounding Fort Hood. I was not impressed.

Until I came to you. It was a cool December evening when a couple guys from my platoon brought me to you. And within 15 minutes, the atmosphere, the air itself, was enough to heal me in ways I never thought possible.

From that moment on, Emo's, Dizzy Rooster, SXSW.... it all called me forth. And each time I drove south on 35 and saw the ""fortress of solitude"" staring back at me, a wave of ecstasy rushed over me and I knew things would be alright. Anytime I had a shitty week, I just came to you and you made me feel better.

And then I had to go home. I didn't want to leave you, the coolest city in the entire world (I have traveled the world since then and still consider this an accurate statement).

And now seven years since I left Fort Hood, I know I'll feel just a little more empty inside because I had to leave you again.

 I have to hit the treadmill for a little bit

I love you

----Scott

PS: My sincerest condolences on the passing of Leslie Cochran. That guy was awesome and he represented so much that is good about you.

* Flask. Bring one.

* Pay that chick 20$ to RSVP you to every party.

* Twitter will tell you about cool parties and celebs whoring themselves for attention. If you're into that

1. @sxfreenoms

* My recommended schedule is wake up at 11 or 1130am

* Movies &amp; Films are starting to outshine the music part the more popular sxsw gets. This is opinion. If you are into big time music acts (lil wayne, jay z etc) then this may be inverse and right up your alley!

* stay hydrated. many party venues have coconut water either free or for 1$. this is a quick path to rehydration.

* create a fake email address and a fake facebook account. some cool parties make you sign in for free admittance. you dont want to give up more of your privacy. use the dummy accounts instead.

* carry as few things as possible. cell phone. wallet. keys. flask. limit it to 5 and under so you dont lose shit. you're going to get drunk and probably high.

* have a good attitude. regardless of weather

* the last weekend is harsh as everyone comes out hoping to find their rapper of choice. take the last saturday easy. 

* dont get overwhelmed.

* study the schedule and make some cant-miss events and stick to them.

* learn the movie theaters by default along with their cross streets. the austin dt naming scheme is easy breezy. rivers and numbers.

* there are free buses. look into them.

* bring an umbrella. you wont need it every day but you dont want to be trapped if it does rain.

* cash is king. dont carry more than 100$ in 20's at any time

* there is a SXSW subreddit

* Traffic will suck from noon - midnight. If you brought\rented a car, car only if absolutely necessary.

* a bicycle is a very convenient transportation method when all the streets are shut down. It's almost a necessity during sxsw. double bag it though and use 2 U locks.

* Sunblock and chapstick are a must.

* Rest. Sleep is important

* Hydrate. Sodas and Alcohol DON'T count.

* Travel light enough to keep your lower back in shape

* Stretch regularly. This is Austin we don't care if you do Yoga in the street. It'll help keep us Weird!

From his facebook status: 
&gt;So on last nights events: Let it be know I walked out on my shift last night and am no longer working at the red room. They hired promoters and changed in too a straight bar in a night. They allowed their promoters door guy to state that it was no longer a gay bar and gays wernt welcome. I watched him send away countless gay men and drag queens away for ""dress code"" while letting straight people in who clearly were not in ""dress code"". No one was informed of a dress code proir the bar opening. I watched these hip hop promoters allow girls they knew in shorts and flats and men in shirts and hats that did not follow their supposed dress code. Also their customers wernt asked to pay a ten dollar cover like every gay person was asked too if they couldn't stop them for ""dress code"". My loyal customers and friends wern't allowed in and were turned away under a false pretense. I fought all night with management and owners saying how messed up it was that my community was no longer welcome. I was told to stick it out and that these were the changes and nothing was going to change. Fed up I went up to door when I saw even more friends and regulars turned away and heard the door man say verbatim "" this isn't a gay bar anymore you can't come in"". I was livid. I went to my owner and said that I understand they paid them but what was happening was wrong. When 80 percent of the staff is gay it was messed up for them to allow this and do nothing but shrug. I said I can't stand here and support this and I am loyal to my community and if they weren't welcome for being gay then I didn't feel welcome. I said I could not morally respect myself as a gay man if I continued to work and let it go. I was told if I was really that uncomfortable I could relieve myself for the night and attend a meeting today. So I did. I shut my bar down and left around midnight. The meeting never happened I was told I was being let go via a phone call and text message because I walked out on my shift. No apologies at all. I refuse to work for a company that allows discrimination against my own people or any one for that matter. I was chastized for being upset throughout the night.

A police report has been filed but I don't expect anything to come of that. Unfortunately we don't have much information but here is what we have:

-Black or dark colored SUV with damage to the front driver side. (My SO's car is silver colored so it is likely to have silver paint on the damaged area.)

-The middle most characters of the license plate are ""A"" and ""J"" in some order.

-Driver was a short, estimated to be somewhere between 20-30 years old.

-Happened in South/East Austin in between Riverside &amp; Oltorf just east of I-35.

I'll post pictures/proof of the damage if wanted.

I won't be able to respond to any replies until approximately 3-4 pm CST.

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit but this is my first post and I can't think of any other subreddits to put this in.

I appreciate it guys &amp; girls.

-The damage would be on his driver side bumper. Possible broken driver side headlight. Silver paint scratches and maybe black from her bumper. (Volvo so it is a real bumper)

-My SO did her best to make out the other car. She thinks it was a slightly newer Chevy.

Duggie was a stray, and his tail is missing. 
But his stump is wagging ferociously.

I've renamed him ""Buddy"", and they were BFFs in a matter of minutes. They spent the evening tearing around their yard.
He doesn't chase our cats (my wife's dog did -- incessantly). He's housebroken

1335837909.0,t0udl,Austin cab driver restores my faith in humanity,Broseph_Heller,156,28,39,"TL;DR: My faith in humanity was restored this afternoon by a random act of kindness from a stranger. 

On the cab ride home from the airport last night, I found his perspective on life to be refreshing and touching. He mentioned that he didn't make a lot of money driving cabs, but he liked it anyways because he got to meet different types of people and learn about human nature.

This afternoon, drove back to the airport and reported the missing purse to airport security and let them open it to look through it for ID. I didn't have any identification in the change purse, so he looked up my payment information, got my name, and took the time to contact the UT police department (he remembered I was a student) to try and get it back to me. UT police called my mom and, long story short, I was able to call the driver and set up a time for him to come to my apartment and drop it off this evening. He refused to let me find transportation to meet him

I just got back to my apartment after picking it up from him outside my complex. I thanked him profusely and offered him a cash reward for his kindness and trouble. He refused to even let me pay for the gas it took to get there. Instead

He could have easily just kept my money and claimed he never found anything. But instead he took time out of his life and job to go through the lengthy process of finding me and returning it. I've never been so touched by such kindness from a random stranger. Even after going through all this trouble to do this for me, generous people in the world who care more about being a good person than making money. And I love that I run into many of these people in Austin.

I'm posting this here because I thought the story might inspire some of my fellow Austin redditors the same way it inspired me. I also wanted to get some recommendations for some awesome local charities that I can donate my ""reward"" money to.

Also, I would STRONGLY recommend calling him. You're guaranteed a safe trip and a life-changing conversation. Feel free to PM me if you want his number :) It's the least I could do to repay him for everything he's done!

1323453945.0,n6gy3,A simple request for East Austinites.,chainsawbarber,162,34,87,"While driving north on Pleasant Valley last night. I saw a a girl stumbling in the street right by the HEB on Riverside.
It looked odd so I turned around to see what was going on.
I pulled over and saw a young lady with lacerations on her face

She had just been involved in a hit and run.
I stopped and rendered aid to the best of my abilities and got an ambulance on the scene asap.
I hope she gets better soon and has a full recovery.

This isn't really my point though.

Driving through East Austin for the last year is like going through the fucking gauntlet.
I live near pleasant valley and I cant tell you how many close calls I've had with pedestrians on E. 6th and 7th.
Bar patrons nearly always wearing dark clothing spill into the streets ignoring the mostly non existent crosswalks. 

What gets my blood boiling is bad cyclists. People on fixies speeding down streets with absolutely no lights
This is bullshit.

Don't ruin my or anyone else's life
Obviously the last thing I would ever want to do is cause harm to anyone with a 2000 lb vehicle. 

Your style is not worth your life.
For fucks sake please be safe. Wear lighter color clothing
Thanks.

tl:dr Please don't get hit by a car by acting stupidly in East Austin.

EDIT: Please don't think I'm advocating anyone to drive like assholes and speed around social areas or anywhere pedestrians might be present.

This shouldn't be a drivers vs. cyclists/pedestrians debate.

Until proper lighting and crosswalks are installed the onus is on both parties to make extra effort to prevent accidents. 

I highly agree with
    
    **comehererightmeow**

    *I think the real problem here is the lack of proper lighting and sidewalks. I think you should send an email 
    detailing your experience(s) to the mayor or the council members and try to get them to fix the problem!*

I do plan on writing an email cataloging my experiences over the past year as both an avid cyclist and driver in the area. I suggest anyone interested should also get involved by calling 311 or sending an email [here](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/council/groupemail.htm)

EDIT: Contacted City of Austin. Austin Energy is apparently responsible for city lighting. I was told I would receive a call back in 3-4 business days to see how to proceed further. I'm absolutely willing to take this to city council. I'll keep this thread updated for anyone who cares to follow.

---------------------------------------------------
PLEASE READ THIS: This is not an April fools joke. 

Last night my backpack and guitar were stolen from me before my gig at the Mohawk. The hard drive that is in that backpack has no back up. It contains all the music that I have been making over the past 2 years. It is not replaceable.

Too many people were in there last night for somebody not to have seen something. I'm not looking to press charges on anyone. The most important thing is that the hard drive is returned. 

If you know where my gear is, log into this email account:

returnmaxfrostsgear@gmail.com 

password: austintexas

You can email yourself from that account where you have placed the items. Or tell me what you saw or who has them. 

This will be completely anonymous. 

That hard drive is worth nothing to you. You couldn't get much for it.
To me

Item list:
Dark brown leather gig bag
Cherry red Gibson SG
Dark green military style back pack 
Mac book pro with black case (only covering the top half)
M audio interface
SILVER HARDRIVE 

Please share this. Especially if you were at the Mohawk last night. 

Thanks again for everyone who came out. Sorry that I never got to play.

A description from  EarthSky.com:

The Perseid meteor shower is perhaps the most beloved meteor shower of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. The shower builds gradually to a peak, for us in the Northern Hemisphere, this shower comes when the weather is warm. The Perseids tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into midnight, and typically produce the most meteors in the wee hours before dawn. They radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus the Hero, but, as with all meteor shower radiant points, you don’t need to know Perseus to watch the shower; instead, you can look for the Perseids around August 10-13. They combine with the Delta Aquarid shower (above) to produce the year’s most dazzling display of shooting stars. In 2013, 12 and 13.

Where will the service be provided? Is the coverage based on zip codes?

Which areas will see service first?
As in Kansas City, specifically the number of interested persons who submit their information [here](https://fiber.google.com/cities/austin/)

Will there be special incentives for local businesses or apartment buildings?

**This was my original letter submitted to Twin Liquors on June 12th.** 


Dear Sirs

I've frequented your 107 W. Stassney location for longer than it's been owned by Twin Liquors... Now that I've established myself as a loyal &amp; qualified consumer of your fine spirits

The discontinued grapefruit juice in the large aluminum can is 1) bad for the environment 2) absolutely delicious mixed with any type of vodka (especially with a squirt of lemon)

Ruby Red, has about as many calories per serving as the alcohol I’m mixing it with. It's loaded with sugar. . It's sweet like syrup.. not tart - like what someone with more arm strength would get when they squeeze a grapefruit... 

...and worst of all - I can't conveniently run to your store to pick up my weekend warrior supplies with hopes of rewarding myself with my favorite drink anymore. 

Here are my options. 1) move to a third world country with more pressing matters than environmental factors surrounding aluminum cans 2) help twin liquors find an grapefruit juice that comes in a biodegradable

Fun Fact - The ruby red grapefruit is the Texas state fruit. With this knowledge

As the famous pair in the Bartles &amp; James advertising once said

""Thank you for your support""

Regards

(Crackercortex)


**This is the response from their Product Administrator

I could not help but feel touched, there had to be an answer.

It is true, the durn things don’t sell well.) But I completely understand the ruby red being too sweet; that’s what the product was designed for. It’s grapefruit juice for people who don’t like grapefruit juice. And I don’t think I could live with the responsibility of you moving someplace like Guatemala or Angola just to get your weekend tipple; there’s enough guilt in my life as is.

Therefore, to be transferred to our Stassney store (along with many others) just as soon as it gets here. There is relief in sight, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, you will, once again, be content to sit on your veranda and enjoy your Greyhound in peace and security.

Okie dokie. So, just made this new account for our trailer!)

Our Story: We are a husband and wife team, we looked to our collective talents and fell back on what we thought was the best fit for us - food. We're artists by nature, (and degree) and in this challenging economy thats pretty much a death sentence, so we made our check list this way: 1) what do people always need? 2) Is there anyway we can fit into one of those niches without going against who we are? 

Answer? Food. Food is the ultimate art form - it is art pursued and consumed by foodies and non-foodies alike day in day out regardless of the economy. Its the everyday art form

So Blue Dog Pizza was conceived. After receiving the rejection that tipped us just too far (three interviews for a job at an ice cream parlor that culminated in the text message ""Sorry no positions. If you're still looking for work by August let us know. :-)"" It was the final straw

I, in particular, my pizzas. I have been cooking my mothers pizza recipe for years, first with her and then on my own in college - by the time I graduated, ""pizza night"" had friends of mine clamoring for invites. It was from this ""fame"" my husband got the idea for our trailer and the rest, as they say, is history. (insanely brief history - but history non the less)

Our little trailer is in the South First Food Court on the corner of 1st and Live Oak and we're making pizzas 5 days a week (Tues-Thurs 11-9, (Goat cheese, Gouda, feta, Pepper Jack and more) to our sauces (Ever seen enchilada sauce on a pizza? Come check us out and take your taste buds on a journey) we treat each pizza as the work of art it is. We offer an excellent vegetarian variety (7 of our 8 main pizzas are either made just for vegetarians, or feature veggie options) and our dessert pizzas are, of course

So to end this incredible long, relax, and enjoy some good food. We have a view of down town, and our lot is BYOB - what's not to like?  

Also, oh I found you on Reddit... "" BAM! Discount. just like that. :-)

Let me know if you all have any questions

TL;DR: Gen Y husband and wife team have opened a new food trailer over on the corner of South 1st and Live Oak that sells beautiful gourmet pizza on a made to order basis and they would LOVE to have some new customers! Also

Ps. screening Blues Brothers right now in front of our trailer! Come on by.

EDIT: Thanks to all the Redditors who have come by thus far with your kind words of encouragement and ready smiles - you made our day! also by request...

They tell me They're going to need to check the bag, and I go and stand off to the side while they open it up, fumble around in it, and put it back on the rack.

I immediately got up and burned through the ridiculous distance between Gate 20 and the security check point, and I hear the throwaway comment that ""they weren't listening."" which i can only assume was for my benefit, but no one really stepped up and owned this mistake.
