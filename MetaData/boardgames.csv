Hey /r/boardgames

This is a great community and we get lots of interesting posts, and then lots of other people see that they do well so make very similar posts.  And of course, doing well by getting upvoted does not necessarily mean conducive to great discussion which is what we try to focus on.  Some people will argue that if they are well upvoted, then they must be good posts, but not everyone agrees. As we grow, we get more people in here who are not familiar with the subreddit’s culture.  We seem to remove pictures of cats in game boxes or “playing” games fairly regularly. Elsewhere on reddit, cat pics are enjoyed and upvoted, /r/boardgames is:

&gt; The #1 reddit source for the news

and those posts rarely, which is why we ultimately made a rule that disallows them.

Sometimes, we do typically invite users to post a self post with the picture, so that they can provide some context for the picture to help generate discussion. What we’ve found interesting is that this seldom happens, which suggests the user was more interested in some quick karma rather than providing a useful and meaningful conversation on the topic of board games. That leads us to our first policy discussion point.

There has been the suggestion in the past about limiting image posts in various ways. What do you think about image posts? Should we tighten up rules about types of images allowed? What specific types of image posts do you think are inappropriate for the sub and why?  Should we ban image/album posts altogether and require they be in a self post?  Please note, providing information about what the picture is about and why it was taken.

Another type of post that can suffer from bandwagonning is kickstarter/crowdfunding posts.  This has its own extra issue in that often the poster is someone who has some kind of interest in the project succeeding (other than being a backer), and one on the Sunday prior to the campaign’s end date. This also doesn’t prevent people mentioning the kickstarter when it’s in the appropriate context of another post. Do members of /r/boardgames think this is a reasonable policy, and we should formalize it? If not, how do you think it should be handled?  This also doesn’t take into account games that are crowdfunded on other sites. /u/notnotnoveltyaccount’s kickstarter posts are wholly voluntary; Kickstarter is far and away the most popular site for crowdfunding board games, and I know it would be a lot of extra work for relatively little gain to try and do the same for other crowdfunding sites. Should we implement essentially the same policy (one main post per game) and encourage additional discussion in the kickstarter round up posts?  Other suggestions?

One regular type of post we get are WSIG (what should I get?) posts. Posts that are asking for game suggestions should be tagged [WSIG] so that users that don’t enjoy this type of content can filter them out using [Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)](http://redditenhancementsuite.com).  As our sub has grown, including an explanation of the WSIG tag.  Also, remember that we have a WSIG section in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig) that we can direct users to when they ask for common game suggestions.  While not all of the sections are fully fleshed out a lot of them are complete or mostly complete and can be helpful to point people to.  We do now have a template in the wiki that seems to get regular use, and a lot of people are encouraging its use. Do you like the way WSIG threads are handled at the moment? Are there any things you’d like to see change?

One of the great things about the community is that it’s clear that members care about the quality of posts here.  One of the manifestations of this is that people click on the **report** button on posts and comments they think are inappropriate in some way.  This brings the post or comment to the moderators’ attention, and it also doesn’t tell us who reported it, so we can’t ask.  So, if you’re reporting a post, please send us a mod mail (there’s a link to “message the moderators” just about the box with the list of moderators in, in the sidebar), linking to the post or comment

Lastly, but for the sake of everyone concerned, we’d like to keep nominations private. This is not a popularity contest.  So, we’ve set up a google form for you to [submit nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mSHu_g60lpqRq46Gku22us2PYYDAJ0FUEYxaTr3iTA/viewform) on - that will save our inboxes and the modmail inbox, and keep all the relevant information together for us to look over and consider. We would like you to nominate users who you think make great contributions to the /r/boardgames community, and we’d like you to tell us why you are nominating them. Please provide links to their great content if possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

He said he noticed that I had some cool looking board games that he didn't really recognize or know much about, I love talking about board games(obviously), and I knew that my experience could be a great resource to the kid.  So I asked him what he has played and liked and what his past experiences were.  He said he hadn't played much yet, but he and his friends really liked some aspects of ""Munchkin"", but was looking for something a new and different, just not too wildly different so it would be an easy transition.  

Now if you know me, that game is much simpler and less strategic than what I usually play.  I doubt you're on my level"", I told him.  

He was obviously a bit taken back, and that there were some things it did right.  This made my friend Marshall jump in.  Marshall hates Munchkin even more than me.  Marshall told him to piss off, and listed all the things that made Munchkin shallow and lucky, and that the strategy was simple and almost non-existant.  The kid saw our point, but was pretty offended, and reluctantly asked if we could still recommend a game for him.  We didn't, that kid didn't deserve it.  

That story is 100% true and I keep thinking about it.  So my question to you all is:  ""Was I too harsh?  I guess I could have been nicer

Well

[The Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/wgd0r/i_love_yugioh_but_due_to_lack_of_other_duelists/)

Right now, and appears helpful now, but for most of the day, the thread was almost virtually without any suggestions, and most of the posts were just bashing Yugioh and putting him down.  Also people felt it necessary to downvote all his comments, the ones defending the game, and the ones responding to other's insults of the game.  Also people were upvoting all the plain ""yugioh sucks"" posts.  

The top post right now on the Reddit Front Page is about Reddiquette: [Link](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/07/on-reddiquette.html).  From this article comes a quote this subreddit needs to be reminded of: ""On reddit

 I can't agree with this more. the upvote/downvote button doesn't mean ""I agree/disagree with your choice of game, shows creativity, effort, original content, and shows quality, deserves upvotes, whether it coincides with your viewpoint or not.  The opposite is true of downvotes.  

I'm disappointed.  This isn't how the subreddit should treat those genuinely asking for advice.  Things devolved into a e-battle for both sides

You're better than that.

I had gotten into board games this past winter, profit maximization, oligopolies, scarcity, etc that comes up in first year Micro. So I brought it in, and we played a 6-team game for an hour and a half.

It was a blast. By the second turn, but I think I had 4 requests on where I bought the game, so they could get a copy themselves. No one wanted to leave either, but sadly, time was of the essence to get to other duties for the day, so I had to pack it up and head off.

* Thematic games (Sometimes called Ameritrash, and often (though not always) have a significant element of luck (for example, via dice rolling). The overall play experience is very much driven by the theme.


**HAVE GOOD ETIQUETTE!**

As posted by Darth_Meatloaf

&gt;It should also be noted that when abbreviations and acronyms are going to be used

&gt;Glory to Rome (GtR)

&gt;And then in subsequent mentions in that thread you can use just the abbreviation.

&gt;This tends to remove the confusion.
 

Not everyone knows these terms, Darth!

Because of that

We occasionally get people come along who have never been part of the group, you like to play games, so try out this game I made."" They've not made any time-investment into the group, so people are reluctant to give them any time back, playing a game of completely unknown quality rather then playing games that they already know or are recently published with a good reputation. If such people ask before turning up, I give them a heads up that that's likely the reaction they will get.

More than once, or the draw-a-random-card-and-do-what-it-says type. That only serves to make us even more wary of people coming in with games they've designed when we have no idea who they are.

But

There's a similar thing in the community we call /r/boardgames. If someone who's regular, and posts a link to the kickstarter of their project - chances are if it's a reasonable product, people will upvote it. 

However, or asking how you can get your product out there better, people get resentful. If you're a board game blogger, and the only posts you make are links to your blog, even if it's relevant content, people don't like it.  If you have a kickstarter project, and all we see from you is links to your own product, people get annoyed. 

If you're part of the community, or kickstarter project, or gaming bloggers. They do, however, have a disregard for people who use this subreddit as a space only to advertise their wares, or have some kind of ""take, take

This problem isn't just in our subreddit, which says in part:

&gt; Please do
&gt;
&gt; * **Feel free to post links to your own content** (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, i.e. only 10% of your submissions should be your own content.

I know that just because a game isn't in the top 100 doesn't mean that it's not a good game

Can someone clarify a couple of things for me? 

Firstly, 108 in strategy games, and 15 in family games. I thought that ""strategy"" and ""family"" on BGG were subsets of the full board game list - that is, a game could be flagged as one or both of them. How is it possible, then, for Settlers to have a lower rank in strategy games than in all games? This implies that there are at least seven things that count as strategy games, but don't count as board games.

Secondly, both Battle Line and Settlers have Geek Ratings of 7.323 and Avg Ratings of 7.45, but Settlers has 39857 reviews and Battle Line has 7920. I've looked up old threads, but I can't seem to find a definitive answer. Someone said something about Bayesian averaging, which would result in Settlers' rating being stronger, since it's from a much larger sample size. The only things I can think of that would account for Battle Line being on top of Settlers is either using the number of years from release being a tiebreaker (with newer games winning) or the system counting digits past what is displayed (e.g. Battle Line really has a Geek Rating of 7.3232 and Settlers has 7.3231).",,self,agricola,

Greetings /r/boardgames!

It was recently brought to the mods' attention that most gaming companies have a strict ""no card text"" policy when it comes to sharing images of rethemed games. The reason for this policy is if the card text is shared it makes it easy for people to copy the game by making their own version without ever buying the source game. Obviously that's bad for the publisher.

Now that we're aware of the issue

From this point forward

If you own the IP

We love seeing the rethemed posts and we hope they continue. The creativity shown by you all is amazing and very inspiring for the rest of us.

I thought others might find the results useful

For those who don't know

I have sorted the games into 1 point weight classes. The BGG rank of the game is in brackets.

[Edit: fixed some typos.]

Update: Some people are unfamiliar with the game weight system on board game geek. The system is even more fuzzy and subjective than the game ratings. Users are supposed to vote based on factors such as overall complexity

Despite its flaws

1368064283.0,1dz2q2,How I teach board games,ohgeetee,231,44,56,"I end up teaching a ton of games to my game group, especially to people new to board gaming, the better.

**The Introduction**  
I start off every explanation with a simple sentence...  ""The goal of this game is to..."" and I fill it in with ""Win

I know we try to have fun at all games, and others where winning is the goal.  I always keep in mind Dr. Knizia's quote: ""The goal is to win, but it is the goal that is important, not the winning.""

**The Goal**  
Next comes how you win...
""You win by having the most VP at the end of the game."" etc.

And when does the game end...
""The game ends after 4 rounds

I do it this way so that every statement I make after this lets the players apply that to their goal.  Who cares if going to action space X lets me put pieces on the board

**The Glossary**  
I usually end up going through a glossary next, difference between turn, round, phase, etc.  Basically all of the verbs and nouns that you would make bold in a rule book.  This is self explanatory; it's so I may use those terms in my descriptions from here on out, as we will be using them all game.  In my glossary explanation, I point out iconography

I think the above is the most important part of teaching a game

**The Guts**  
For VP games, I would say something along these lines:
""You get VP by planets and developments placed, consuming(I'll explain this later), and end game points via these 6 cost developments.""

Then I'll move into actual gameplay, some of which may have been covered in the VP area, but I'll give more detail this time around.  If it's a role selection, I'll describe the roles, and so on.

Some games it's best to just play a trial round after the glossary and VP descriptions

**Tips**  
Here are some general tips:

* Know the game you're teaching.  It helps a **ton** to have set up the game and worked your way through a couple of rounds before you try to teach someone else.
* Don't just jump right into ""OK, Oh!, and this is important too..."" because the whole time people are thinking ""Why?"" even if they don't realize it.
* Pause every once in awhile to see if there are questions about the things you have gone over.
* Don't be shy about curtailing efforts to ""help"" you teach a game.  One of the more frustrating things when trying to learn a new game is having a sidekick interrupt with rules he thinks you'll miss
* For really important things that people often overlook on their first play, I always reiterate it, and give a castle wall test while I'm explaining(set up 3 piles of goods, have them point out which, if any, are legal castle builds, then ask why and why not).
* Remember that people learn in 3 primary ways: Reading, but heavy in one.  If someone wants to check out the rules while you teach, it will probably help them understand better.  Try to mix up the doing and talking to cover the other styles.

If you've had issues with teaching games and folks just not getting it, but it is a real shame to see someone sour of a game because of how poorly it was taught.

Let me know if I have missed anything or if you have any tips of your own to share.  I dig seeing other people's styles.",self,t5_2qmjp,1368068660.0,,power-grid,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1dz2q2/how_i_teach_board_games/

I need to pick up my kid from school now.  Thanks for some great questions.  I'll come back tomorrow and respond if any others get posted.  Cheers!
--- EDIT---

Here are some things you might want to ask about:


Entrepreneurship: we raised $700k to start a board game company.  Our biggest hits are Wits &amp; Wagers and Say Anything which are in Target, Kohl's, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc.  We have 10 employees and finally moved out of my basement several months ago.


MBA sweatshop: how we hoodwinked our unemployed MBA classmates to assemble our games for pizza and beer.


Game Designer: I designed Wits &amp; Wagers and Say Anything.  These brands have sold over 700


Game Player: I was a pro Magic player for 15 years.  Losing to Jon Finkle in the finals in 97 is my biggest claim to fame


Boat Captain: I captained an Alaskan salmon fishing boat for 12 seasons before jumping ship and starting North Star Games.  My determination to follow my dream came while the boat was sinking on a hella stormy night.


TedX: I gave a TedEx talk about how the Spiel des Jahres has changed the board game industry

I have bought two new games recently because I saw a collection with a lot of games I had and I asked the owner about them

I believe I am not in the minority when I say all of this because these posts are often upvoted and have plenty of positive comments.

Aggregating them all in a single post is much less productive because it is very difficult for interesting collections to get to the top if they are posted recently.

Plus, you just need to exclude threads starting with [COMC]. To do that you need the add-on **Reddit Enhancement Suite**, which improves Reddit in many ways (should be available for most browsers).

Last November, but there is still plenty of room to grow. My question to you guys is do you know any good ways to spread the word about my store? Any types of suggestions of what i can do or should be doing would be awesome, but first let me tell you a little about my store.  I am going to do it in list for, since I am terrible at structuring things.

-The store is called ""The Game Gamut"".
- We are located on a busy Main St. where tons of cars go by us daily.
- Our building is an old historic landmark house with multiple rooms.  This allows for some very interesting setup for merchandise.
- We completely redid the place.  Added slat-wall
-  Has a very inviting feel.  Most game stores don't feel like that.
- Since I have worked with kids a lot
-A very unique selection of games ranging from kids games to the more intense strategy games.  The inventory is constantly being added to as well.
- A large selection of demo games to be used at our game nights. as well as to help customers see games better.  I am constantly adding to that to.
-game nights offered Tuesday and Thursday to all ages.  We will probably be doing more soon.

That's really all I can think of at the moment.  If you have any questions

1361620035.0,192rdl,"Should I use the term ""Ameritrash"" in my commercial board game writing?",mrquinns,232,71,149,"HELLO!

Quinns here. I'm a part-time lurker, Rock Paper Shotgun, IGN, whoever's paying.

ANYWAY, is actually pretty harmful to the hobby. Everyone who wants to get into boardgames has to learn, over however many days or weeks or years, that it's an affectionate term. Until then, they're going to assume there's more conflict and elitism in our much-loved hobby than there is.

It is a *useful* term, conflict, surprise and immediacy. But in addition to that elitism, the geographic implications that these games are only played or made in America are (today) mostly nonsense. So long as we keep using this word, it's only going to create confusion, conflict, and hurt feelings.

Why bother with all that?

So, whether we could come up with a different term. And if we do *that*, I could start pushing it through all my board game writing.

I don't think we'll be able to start a revolution

Thoughts?

EDIT: Thanks so much

I'm going to stop using the term Ameritrash, pulp or thematic. Though I like American-style best because it reminds me of eggs for some reason and makes me hungry.

### COMCs

If you've been around a while

Anyway. I’d like to propose a compromise: A semi-regular (weekly, whatever) selfpost for the community collections. Perhaps similar to how the “What did you play this weekend?” posts go. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about: [Hey r/boardgames, show us your collection](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/nvk5q/hey_rboardgames_show_us_your_collection/)

### WSIGs

Don't forget that we have a collection of frequently asked WSIGs in the sidebar. I know that these are outdated, the ones without further detail, that get posted have already been exactly asked. 

### The Wiki

Speaking of, I think. I'll post more about this when the wiki gets released.

### Current Stuff We Do

* Meeple of the Week - Granted
* Bazaar - Not putting one up for October in lieu of the math trade
* Top 10 - I still update this at least once a month. I dropped the ball from weekly updates after I went on a two week vacation back in August. I plan to get back onto the weekly updates habit again. To contribute, also).
* Banner - I'm not sure how many people know this, and [here's an album the banner originals](http://imgur.com/a/sOnGD), if you want to see what kind of photo composition makes a good banner.

Anything else? We’re absolutely open to ideas.

### Content

Something that the mods and I currently do is try to help orient to the subreddit to be ""discussion based"". Sometimes this means we moderate content that we feel is unproductive to this goal. 

Haul posts, other than ""I love this game."" And one haul posts seems to spawn five other haul posts, and then it turns into a problematic trend. We also tend to remove pictures of games in session, unless it is accompanied by a session report from the OP. Of course, not always the case; it's on a discretion basis. I generally dislike removing posts, and leaving it at the hands of the community voting. But sometimes I feel like the content of the subreddit with get disoriented if the picture submissions don't get removed, because they tend to be the submissions to get a couple hundred upvotes

But

A deeply analytical

*These are must-play games because they are the most common games redditors enjoy to play or believe to be culturally significant (like watching a classic movie just so you get pop-culture references to it.)*

While I can understand that seeing all of these similar posts can be annoying to some, I try to put myself in these new users shoes and think about how much I would have appreciated it if someone had helped me when I was new to the hobby.  Yes, the sidebar can answer most of those questions, but sometimes you just want some quick feedback from people who know what they're talking about

* **Learning** - If I don't find that I can contribute, everyone knows that learning is half the battle

**Your Job As Host**

As the host it is your job to make sure you have enough space and your place is clean. People do not want to come over and step over your beer bottles to sit in a small cramped room and try and play a board game. You may love your cat/dog but if he going to be jumping on people or knocking the table/jumping on the table

**Who is Coming**

One of the most important things to think about for planning a successful board game night is “Who Is Coming”. This can change what games you can play as different people might like different games or if you have just convinced someone to try some modern games.

**Time**

How much time you have is also very important as well for what games you are going to play.  Only have 3 hours? Do not plan on playing Twilight Imperium.  I have found that there are 3 main time frames to aim for; The 3 Hour Jam

Practice explaining the rules (setup up the board and tell the thin are what this does and why you want to do that).  Have cheat sheets ready

**What Games Are Planned**

Always have a plan of what you are going to play. If you go to someones place and sit there for 15 minutes saying “What game do you want to play”

Key Notes:

* Are  new people coming then play a gateway game
* What are peoples favorite games who are coming
		Even if you don't like Munchkin sometimes it would be better to play it so others have more fun
* How much time you have.
* How much space do you have.
* How loud do you have to be.
		If my fiance is going to be in bed I won't plan for Cosmic Encounter

**Food**

My last major point is probably the hardest to get right.  Food

*2 major notes I have* 

* If you have 1 or 2 guys do a fast food run tip the driver. If you are buying a $7 meal give the driver a 10 and don't expect change. Splitting up 6 bills is annoying. On a budget can't spare a few bucks? Offer to be the driver.
* Host never buys his own beer either rotate where you are playing or rotate who is buying beer

**How to Spruce Up a Game Night**
When I wrote this up for my friend it was pages longer than this so I am bullet pointing this last part so people actually try to read this.

* Theme nights. Make a zombie theme night where you play Zombie Dice
* Make a rule about cell phones. This didn't need to be on my list until recently but I had a horrible game night because one person was playing with their cell phone all night then would make a bad play and then complain about the game being unbalanced and his army sucking (he was Greyjoy in AgoT). This doesn't mean ban cell phones but make at least a rule about them.
* Don't be a rules Nazi
* Making fun house rules can really liven up a game night. Make a house rule that you have to roll on the table
* Now this point is my own opinion and so I know its right. Dice Towers Suck. I bought a dice tower once and thought it would be the best thing but when you roll the dice it feels like you got that roll when you use a dice tower people feel like the tower rolled it.",self,t5_2qmjp,False,,cosmic-encounter,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/14n4gr/how_to_throw_a_good_game_night/

Alright. Clearly we didn't so hot on the last post

Last week, contacted us with concerns about the rethemes posting the full card text. Before you complain about him contacting us instead of talking to the community about it, he said in his message, ""I'm wondering about the mods stance on this. I was going to make a post but figured I shouldn't if the mods actually condone those types of posts.""

Well

&gt; So there's been a lot of rethemes posted up here and i wanted to step in officially as the publisher and say...

&gt; They're pretty darn cool!

&gt; Now, us) please don't post entire sets where it could be print and play. Show a few, maybe have some in piles or arranged where they can't all be read. Very much like most have been here.

&gt; Anyway

And I thought, *it made sense*. We honestly didn't expect the reaction that happened, we thought it would make sense to the rest of the community also. Didn't realize it would be controversial. Oh well.

So that's how the rule got drafted up, or else I might have been able to contribute to a better ""rule"".

Basically, if you want to upload them straight on, then I guess hide the card text.

I don't want to talk about what's copyrightable, *is* Love Letter, and I think that's disrespectful to the publisher. AEG does not post their card images up anywhere.

If you didn't see davefp's comment from the last discussion

&gt; I think that intent is the most important thing here. Consider these two (imaginary) submissions:

&gt; 'Check out my Dr. Who re-theme of Love Letter'

&gt; vs.

&gt; 'Here's a print-ready pdf of my Dr. Who re-theme of Love Letter'

&gt; The first post is showing off a custom creation. We love posts like these. It wouldn't be possible to create a copy of the game from the photo.

&gt; The second

&gt; If I could rewrite this rule

&gt; Do not post copyrighted material in a printable format. This includes counter sheets

I pulled examples of Love Letter rethemes from our history:

What I think is totally fine:

* [Arkham City: Riddlers Letters](http://i.imgur.com/03BHCkX.jpg)
* [Animal Crossing](http://i.imgur.com/MLrofSe.jpg)
* [Mario](http://imgur.com/a/XlYXQ)

What I think is not okay:

* [Arrested Development](http://imgur.com/a/qbHsk)
* [Doctor Who](http://imgur.com/a/mWK1q)
* [Breaking Bad](http://i.imgur.com/A4sBpTR.jpg)
* [Cowboy Bebop](http://imgur.com/a/G1QYY)

A lot of people told us in the comments of the last thread that it wasn't our place as subreddit moderators to make a rule like this. It wasn't needed

We're not here to just make rules when we think of something that sounds fun. The rules we do make are to allow us to point to something when we decide to remove a post. A lot of it I would love to be community controlled. In fact, we don't want to get a reply back with ""Well, you didn't say anywhere it says no memes!"" We left the Kickstarter posts in your control for the longest time, and only have a small rule about it now. It's all issue dependent though.

Anyway. But

1368082136.0,1dzl4s,I love board games. Here's why.,esspysee,173,37,55,"I'm 25 years old. I work a tidy

It speaks to something that lies deep in my psyche, bits &amp; pieces or differing combinations of the three. It speaks to a lack in video games, for years my entertainment of choice.

I bought Red Dead Redemption in June of 2012. I am still yet to remove it from it's case despite a craving to play it. I'll never get through Skyrim. Grand Theft Auto? You can GTFO with that noise. Don't get me wrong

I first bought Nintendo Monopoly. I'd never really been great at Monopoly, for my first true foray into real nerdy Board Gaming was a real bad move. SO many bits! And Tokens! LAWD what a big box of stuff. Then we played it, consulting the labyrinthine tome of a rule book, mastering just how mean and bastard-like this game truly is.

I played the epic, an 8-hour saga at three people which plays up to eight people. Even then... I was drained at the end of it. It taxed me, it vexed me, it made me really REALLY want to play light and easy to digest games.

It's not all military strategy though: I made my brothers fans of Ticket to Ride, where you... Ahh, never mind. The main thing is OH GOD IT WAS AWESOME. King of Tokyo! 7 Wonders! I bought Say Anything in and my team at work had a great 40 minutes cracking each other up. Some then went and BOUGHT IT.

This is the ultimate testimony as to why I love this hobby. It's right there. On the table. Entirely in your reach. No controllers block you from the thing, a game where you make a Cohen Brothers movie in the time it would take to watch one. You know what's not? That same faceless douchebag from that game of Call of Duty. Only somehow, he's playing WoW with you now.

My board game collection is taller than me if you were to stack them one on top of another. Both you and I, not TO them. When I try and converse, it feels like a lecture. There's no organic cause and effect. I feel it happen , too. But give me King of Tokyo, and suddenly I'm loose and easy, cracking wiser while you beat my ass.

OH! That's the other thing- I'm not EVEN THAT GOOD at playing games! I'm not competitive. I just like to play. I like rolling dice and seeing what happens. I like throwing down my hand in Ascension and using those cards to buy heroes and beat monsters. I adore PLAYING.

I have a dream. It happened once or twice. But in it, ""I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fight the giant ooze thing."" And he says it like he's gonna free fall from an aeroplane. And he rolls the dice. THAT is a moment of pure joy and emotion. I felt it age 10 playing mouse trap, I felt it age 24 playing Game of Thrones. And you share it with other people. So, please make time to play with me. Let me show you something new, something cool.

Because I love you.

But we're not playing Risk. Or Monopoly.

1359746218.0,17pkcw,Rules Explanation Guide to Power Grid,kerred,134,23,56,"Edit:  Here is sybrwookie's guide

***
. It's one of my fav games and I have taught it many

1) Have someone who hasn't played pick a color

2) Explain theme.

 3) Explain that there's a few phases a turn and we keep going through turns till someone has built 15/17 cities

4) Auctioning! I randomize start player at that point, and can buy one a turn. 

5) Buy resources (only resources which your plants can use)

 6) Buy houses, explain connection costs. 

7) Turn in resources from your power plant to power the cities you have built (and you can only use each power plant once per turn, how many you POWER. 

8) Explain how turn order changes (yes

9) Say how we keep doing that until 2 times: 
when someone builds 7 cities, and only where we have not already built) and then 15/17 cities, explaining the victory condition again.

THEN

1) Whoever is first in turn order is usually making jokes about being screwed at some point along the way here, so if he buys the 3, he's GUARANTEED to be first for resources and first to pick a spot to build on that first turn, and possibly the second turn as well.

2) Resources usually play out quite easily.

3) Building, but having no competition.

4) Powering

5) Unless someone brings it up before now, I handle reordering myself (it's the most confusing part), show anyone who is confused why he's in the spot he is, in the turn order, and say, ""OK, and now we keep doing those steps over and over.""

6) NOW is the time where I mention the limit of 3 plants. It doesn't matter on turn 1 (the highest plant which can drop in turn 1 is the 13, and you just want the best you can get). On turn 2, there's times where the 20, 25, or 26 can drop down, and it matters to know just how important those are early on, and introduce the term, it's only who powers the most when someone builds 15/17 who wins....note that's the third PLANNED time I mention the game-ending condition). I also mention that you never again HAVE to buy a power plant and how it works if you pass

Honestly, we've done turn 1 and I'm done explaining for the most part. Only the most dense people I've seen haven't gotten it after turn 1.

The only other things that I haven't mentioned at this point are obsolescence and what happens with the available plants when Step 2/3 hits (and I keep an eye on the game to make sure to let people know if it's important, which I explain if I see it's close.


***





***

My version for novelty purposes:

Power Grid can be quite overwhelming to a player not familiar with many euro-like game mechanics.  And just as overwhelming trying to convey to a new player how much planning ahead they need to do to avoid getting left behind.

Hopefully the following guide may help moves things along for newer players.   *Keep in mind that there are quite a bit of resources online

I suggest to explain it to at most 3 new players.  4-5 newcomers to Power Grid can be very messy if trying to explain all of them at once

***

**Intro**

""In Power Grid we are all Mr. Burns, and juicing up houses that we build to get money.  With that money we will buy better plants, more resources, more houses, and light them up for more money, and so on.  We will play a practice game up until someone builds their 7th house.  Whoever lights the most of their houses on that final round will be the winner.  So pretty much everything you do before that won't give you points or anything.  Its all about racing to get ahead for the final round.""

***

**Components**

""Here is the map.  You will see there are seven cities in each of these colored regions.   

Can you point to any color section you want us to play in?  Any one at all.

Okay

&lt;repeat&gt;

Okay

Everyone grab a bunch of houses.  The color your pick has nothing to do with the color regions on the board.  

Put one of your houses on this 0 for houses.  That keeps track of the number of houses you built.  It will also help us determine turn order.  Speaking of which

Now we will lay out the power plants.  See plants 03 - 06?  Those are the power plants up for auction.  See plants 07-10?  That is the future market.  These will be up for auction later.  I am putting this nice clean 13 power plant on top of this deck of other power plants I'm shuffling.

Now can someone set up the resources?  It should look like this picture in the instruction book.  There is coal, and everyone's favorite:  uranium, mostly used for the uranium pew 36 explosive space modulator &lt;end Marvin voice&gt;, but more mostly for some of these red power plants we'll see later.

Finally

***

**First Turn: Auction**

""Now I could sit here and explain all the steps

Look on your little reference cards.  The first part is ""determine turn order"", but we'll do that later.

Next is 'buy power plants'.  See where it says 'best begins?'  That means turn order is from first to last.  So I will go first

In this first round we MUST buy a power plant

Now you have a choice, or bid higher than me for it.  Do you want it?  We can all pass for now just to get things moving, but up to you.  I will explain how the plants work afterwards, and as I said we can start over.""

Since [this person] bought a power plant

*Continue with auction*

""Remember how I said turn order is determined by most houses

***

**First Turn: Resources**

""Its time to buy some stuff for our plants.  See how your card says 'worst begins'?  That means whoever is in last place gets to buy first.""

For resource buying

""I will explain how these resources will power houses when we get to everyone's favorite thing about playing games:  the bureaucracy!

***

**First Turn: Building**

""Its time to build!  on your card, only one house per city.   Once someone puts a house in a city, no one else can build there.  You can build past it of course, paying huge sums of money to do it most likely!""

""See this 10?  In our practice game we will just use the $10 for a house space.  Normally when you play

Building is the toughest for new players, so they understand about how they will get cornered in a region.

**First turn:  Bureaucracy**

""The moment you been waiting for!  The bureaucracy!""

""Get money!  What does that mean?  Count how many houses you have on the board.  That's the maximum number of houses you can light this turn.   If your plants let you light more than that

Look at your plants.  See the resources you put on them?  It says at the bottom that you can discard those resources to power up those number of houses.  You can't use all the resources

Now

Ahhhhhhh

&lt;the rest of the beaucracy should be fairly easy to explain&gt;

**End of first turn**

""And that is it!  Would you all like to  start over

**Second Turn**

Explain turn order.  Should be simple now to have them get set up.

""So, resources, AND buildings.  So you are going to have to plan ahead, and maybe set aside money in your head, like ""i'll spend at most this much on power, this much on resources, and I should have enough of this money to build these houses.  The book doesn't say to hide your money or not, so we have to or they'll downvote us somehow.""

**Things to explain later**

When a player buys a 4th power plant

How you can be ""that guy"" who inflates a bid.

***

**Common mistakes for new players**

Not having enough money to build.  

The 'worst begins'.   Players may get so excited about buying resources

Losing track of the objective.  2-3 turns before you think the game will end

***

**First time long game**

Playing the regular game is fine for your average avid gamer.  In this case you say the same thing

It would also be good to clarify about the final round houses,False,self,t5_2qmjp,1360074461.0,,cosmic-encounter,t3_17pkcw

1358267418.0,16mh5r,Are promises made to be broken in games? Where is the line drawn between what is acceptable and unacceptable betrayal/deception?,dougmansion,118,17,207,"The reason I ask is because of an infuriating game of Eclipse I played at a con last year. The situation was thus: two players had teamed up early in the game to their great mutual benefit, and would take the game if he was not betrayed then and there. So

The betrayed man was infuriated, and that the rest of us were honorless and craven for encouraging him to break his word. When we said this was just a game, he said a promise was a promise, and a man's word should not ever be broken. After a half an hour of arguing, the man turned to us, and said, ""You may win this game, he left

I haven't lost a second of sleep because of this; alliances in games to me are fragile in their healthiest of states, and I wonder what the community thinks. Is there a place for honor in gaming? As long as one does not break the rules (or even the spirit of the rules), is anything else permitted? Does saying, ""I promise to _____"" make that pact any more wrong to break?

Looking forward to your thoughts

This is a direct port of the boardgame to Windows

For those that don't know the game

**Rules Overview**

[The board](http://www.thetoyboxgodalming.co.uk/USERIMAGES/memoir44_contents.jpg) is made up of hexes and divided into left

Players cards draw from a shared deck at the end of every turn. By choosing one card to play at the start of your turn, as well as many other special cards.

The units themselves move and attack according to their type
[The d6 dice themselves show: infantry x2, retreat and star](http://www.dicecollector.com/WOOD_D6_DAYS_OF_WONDER_MEMOIR_44_01.jpg). If you roll the symbol for the type of unit you are attacking you get a hit. A grenade is always a hit, retreat usually causes the defending unit to move back a space, and stars are misses. 

Units can take a certain number of hits before being destroyed
There is also terrain features

**AIM**
The aim of the game is to be first to a certain number of victory points

**F2P restrictions**: the basic maps (I think 3 or 4) are free, I have played many games and only used 3 ingots so far.

**Short Review** 4/5 - I really like this game, to reflect history. The average win rate by the allies is shown in the map selection menu by a percentage.

As always seems to be the case with boardgame ports to computer

My family and I sat around and drank beer and wine and played my new game of Galaxy Trucker. We pulled the epidemic card seconds before midnight hit. My sister won the game by 23 credits (with a total of 84 to my 61) and my dad did pretty well despite it being his first game. (45 or so credits if I remember right)  Honorable mention for my sister's boyfriend for getting his level 3 ship blasted to the point where he just boosts into first at the end (open space) with only (iirc) 5 parts left

My mom even decided she wanted to sit and watch us play.  Looks like the top game on my wishlist ended up being a hit with the family.  I didn't even suggest playing Galaxy Trucker while waiting for midnight--my sister suggested playing it again and getting dad to try it.  There was confusion over the rules from all, I decided against taking a picture of the setup we had (and then was too busy enjoying the game to get an in game picture), but it was funny because dad's table is apparently exactly the right size for a 4 player game of Galaxy Trucker.

Before that, you get 1 point for each tile under each letter of your word and, if you change a second word with a letter in the word, you get to score the second word *(so if ""GOOD"" was on the bottom level and I played on top of the G to play ""FEAR"" down from there, I'd end up with 4 points for the letters in FEAR, 1 point for the G under the F, then 4 points for FOOD, the letter underneath the shared letter [F in this case] gets scored twice if you link words.)*  I won't even mention how much my sister slaughtered us in that game--my brain just decided not to register the information. ;)

Another nice board game related thing for New Year's Eve for me was that I got to show my daughter Ticket to Ride on my computer and she got excited about it and decided she wants it on her birthday wishlist.  She helped me play a base game of it.  I would tell her what colors we need and show her why (though I knew she's gloss over that) and she'd tell me what cards to draw and help me count how many more I need.  After we won the base game of it, so I played the Legendary Asia map and, of course, she had good laughs at all the trains going away.

* **Designer:** Corey Konieczka

* **Publisher:** Fantasy Flight Games

* **Year Released:** 2008

* **Game Mechanic:** Hidden Traitor, Hand Management, Dice Rolling

* **Number of Players:** 3-6 (best with 5; recommended 4-6)

* **Playing Time:** 180 minutes

* **Expansions:** [Exodus Expansion]( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/85905/battlestar-galactica-exodus-expansion)

In Battlestar Galactica players take on the role of one of the characters from the tv show.  Each character has a special ability and a once per game ability that can be used to help them win the game as well as a limitation that may hinder their gameplay.  Humans work together to try and get the ship to Kobol before they run out of fuel, or before the ship takes on too much damage.  Cylons hide among the humans and do everything within their power to make sure the humans do not succeed.  Crises happen at the end of a players turn and may consist of a number of things that will set the humans back if they fail the crisis.  Players can try to pass them, but with cylons in around nothing is ever guaranteed…

1327667097.0,oz1qa,A review of how my non-gamer games night went last night!,DirtySketel,106,11,39,"We played games until we crashed at 3am. I suggested we stop at about 11. But my guests just wanted to keep playing.

That is how well it went last night. I was pretty nervous to start with (I always am before social events, though they are a little ill so retired to bed pretty quickly after). We started at 7 o'clock, or tried to at least and just chatted with drinks for 20 minutes. Then I cracked out our home-made version of the Resistance despite a couple of recommendations against it (which I'm still very thankful for). Our home-made version had pretend mission cards with silly parodies of a resistance against our own government (the kidnapping of Cameron Davidson was one of the missions, for instance). Thanks to a couple of extraverted people in the group, everyone got into it right away and we had a great time, despite it being clear that (unless we had got the rules wrong), it was virtually impossible for the Resistance to win in a group of 9 (housemates). We really found out who the best liars in the group were, with our blood pressure a little high from the arguments and a strong sense of fighting a losing battle.

After this, apart from the ever-unpopular twiglets, were made short work of.

My games were all arranged on the table. I gave a brief speech explaining that although they'd probably not seen any of these games before that they're a lot of fun, like Arkham Horror (explaining that it was a co-op game - a few people asked to play it but I said it was a bit too complicated for 7 people to learn in their first games night with beer) and Settlers Of Catan.

Then we played a quick round of the Rage Face drinking game

Once we were merry, into 2. A couple of the people there had played Settlers once before, so I suggested that they play a different game. They were happy to oblige (one of them had said before we started that he just wanted to try as many new things as possible to night) and sat down to choose a different game (from a refined list of simple games). I wanted the complete newbies to play Settlers because that game is great for new players - it just gets people thinking and talking while doing familiar things like rolling dice and building little Monopoly-like houses. Also, [Andy made this before the game even started](http://i.imgur.com/WdQqI.jpg). I explained the rules as I always do (‘This is the island of Catan, and we are explorers!’) but got kinda frustrated because the guys on the other table were just trying to chat with the people I was explaining the game to. I was patient, and just waited for them to finish, even though it took several false starts and I had to go over most of the rules again during play.

The other group selected Carcassonne as their game

Both games went really well. I lost at Catan

After the games, but we just played until everyone was tired and ready to either go home or crash in our other room at 3.

We agreed that we would have another games night in a fortnight, and one said he'd always been curious about table-top gaming but had never known anyone who played them.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions to improve the night - we read all of them, but thanks all the same!",,False,self,t5_2qmjp,True,twilight-struggle,

I understand the feeling of being new to boardgames and wanting to catch up to everyone else's impressive collections. They look so pretty on the shelf! And the games themselves

What I think new players need to do though, say, 20 different games extensively in 3 months? I would bet that this is a Herculean task for even the most experienced of gamers, and I think it does a disservice to the great games in your burgeoning collection. I went through this phase myself, and looking back, I wish I had spent some more intimate time with the games I bought first, learning their in-and-outs... many of these games have great depth that you may not readily recognize on your first few playthroughs, or fiftieth. I've played well over a hundred games of Dominion, perhaps luring you away from what you thought you might have wanted in the first place. Leave yourself some room to take your collection down paths you might not have initially foreseen.

Before you roll your eyes (or after depending on how impatient you are) allow me to explain; this isn't about the points totals.

I brought Agricola with us (the wife and I) to play while on holiday in the caravan. She's never played before and, Carcassone and other light-to-medium games but not too involved.

The children are asleep and we sit down to a game. At this point I must stress I'm not a great games teacher - really. No matter how excited or methodical I am

In my teens I got pretty deep in to Risk. I just loved it. But I always felt it kind of lacked something.

I'm 25 now, and looking at pictures and stuff of the board, I brought it up to some buddies. The response was an uproarious ""Meh"", until just recently.

My buddies girlfriend endorsed it. Drops an ""Oh i'd *love* to play it"" so he decides to get me an early wedding gift (I'm getting married this year) so we can play some serious Settlers of Catan. *I was fucking stoked*

I had read enough and seen enough to know that, my friend and his girlfriend. It went slow as we learned the rules, and how each turn flowed ect. By the end of the first game we were pretty comfortable with how each turn worked.

My fiance called it at that, and is a classic early leaver. Calls it at like 9:30pm, never later than 11pm. **He is calling for another game at 2am**

Shit just got real.

My fiance is out, and my own fiance cock-blocked me with the diplomatic helping hand of my two other opponents. The veteran (My friends girlfriend) won by a wide margin. But the second game, I knew what was what.

I knew what the numbers, as this was my buddy and his woman, it was essentially a 2v1 game. I was outnumbered from the start.

I fought a hard game, and 2 clay each time. But, as I was the only one getting hit by robber, it was difficult to stay my ground.

Eventually, I just couldn't get any. They would accept no trades, as they knew I was too close to winning to risk it.

Then, and stealing the road card for herself, taking her to nine points, an upgrade or settlement away from victory.

I knew it was over for me, I couldn't upgrade, build, or get dev cards. I was stagnated.

Once my buddy realized he was so far behind me and her, and tried to take whatever he can from whoever, however. He stalled her enough for me to draw even, at 9-9.

But alas, it was just after 4am.

This is literally the most fun I have had playing a board game, you would understand that endorsement is for fucking real.

The first thing to know about the game is that the first time you play it, people were complaining about the relative complexity.  You kind of get the fear that people are going to turn on the game and not give it a fair shake, but after we got into the game, people calmed down and really got into it.  We had several exclamations of ""holy shit, this game is *cool*,"" though that could have been the beer talking.

In any case, influence, research, upgrade, build, or move.  However, the choice of what you'll do with each action is significant and the limited number of turns works to keep the game sane.

It's all about figuring out the path that works best for you:  maybe large exploration with large upkeep but large income, etc.  Your goal isn't to wipe everyone else out (I imagine that it might be damn near impossible to actually take everyone else out by force), but to win victory points.  You get those through a variety of means.  You unveil a sector of space with some ancient aliens in it that need to be conquered, and it's adjacent to your area.  You don't have the force yet, or maybe it's close, but your neighbor might.  Do you go in early, before they can react, but what if they swoop in right after with your weakened fleet guarding the place?  Or do you let them take it and overproduce a dreadnaught or two the next turn and then take it back?  Maybe you can just leave it

Research is SO key, the rest of us were exploring far-flung space and fighting each other... and he's the one that ended up with the most points.  The ""Traitor"" card kept people afraid enough to break their treaties with him, but really, they should have attacked him early.

In any case, you cannot possibly accomplish everything that you want, so you have to make decisions based on what you have and what you want, and hope that they turn out.  You really needed that Advanced Economy to make more money out of your home sector, but someone else grabbed that upgrade before you could.  What do you do?

This is early in the game.  I'm the red people, not the big board on the left.

http://i.imgur.com/i5yUBVz.jpg

My main goal was exploration, so I turned over a few cards that didn't produce anything for me until the very end of the game, when I had ultrabadass dreadnaughts to conquer the areas.  I should have produced some mid-level ships and gambled a bit... though my friend (the one that one) gambled a few times with his buffed-up interceptors and sent two different missions full of them to their deaths.  So it goes both ways.  I had another friend that assaulted the galaxy core with upgraded dreadnaughts twice, but just could not get lucky on any die rolls, and failed very hard.

This is later in the game.  The victor (the green player) was already taking down his pieces

http://i.imgur.com/y4y6eLq.jpg

Once you know what you're doing, and the wide scope of upgrades and research available gives everyone enough space to play exactly how they want to play... within their limitations.

Next game, but the aliens get a variety of fairly divergent bonuses, and those differences sound really fun.  We kind of started the game with people expecting to be drowning in management minutiae, but we ended the game with everyone very eager to play again as soon as we can.",,False,self,False,t3_17xxf9

I want to clarify a couple of things. These are games that I LIKE, there seems little chance that I will get to play any of them again, and I have way too many games in my collection. I have decided to give them away to find them “good homes”, which might not happen if I were to just sell or trade them. 

Although I am NOT really doing this “for charity”, geekgold, Reddit gold, and *definitely* no trades. I will pay shipping. I will consider shipping just about anywhere, but for me, it is easier to ship in the US.

To the people who have urged me to give them to charities instead, blood, and time to charities on a regular basis.

To avoid making this more of a circus than it already is, which game you are interested in, and why I should send it to you. If you live outside of the US, let me know. DON’T give me your address unless I decide to send it to you. I will contact the ""winners"" via PM. Nobody is getting more than one game. I will decide, randomly if need be, who gets what. I will ship them next week.

To be clear, etc., and you must also promise that if you play it and don’t like it, you will pass it on.

The games are:

1) [Battlestations](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12350/battlestations), you must promise that you do have such a group.

2) [Barbarossa to Berlin](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3353/world-war-ii-barbarossa-to-berlin). This is a fairly serious “card-driven” wargame, gathering dust. Before you request this game, please understand that it takes 5 or 6 hours to play.

3) [Vinci](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/60/vinci). An all-time favorite of mine. In fact, it seems I will never get to play it again. To get this game, you must promise that you do NOT own Small World. FWIW I admit that this game COULD work in a school environment, and I will give consideration to requests for that purpose.

**Update: Due to the huge volume of responses, and thanks for your patience.**

**Update II: I notified the ""winners"" last night. I will give them each a couple of days to respond before I decide if I will give the game to somebody else. I will wait and send them all at the same time to save myself trips to the post office.** 

**Some of you might wonder how I chose the ""winners"". I read each message, it was just dumb luck.**

1373434044.0,1hzndl,The difference between a designer and a publisher,IngredientX,105,19,21,"One thing I keep seeing here is that people keep on blaming designers for a publisher's decision. For example

At a recent con, so he had no way to change the situation.

Sadly, here's a quick guide to who's responsible for what:

A *designer* is responsible for the rules to a board game. He will spend years making sure the gameplay is balanced and fun. 

A *publisher* is the one who assumes the financial risk in paying for the print run, quality of physical components, and cost of the game.

If a designer is self-publishing, the publisher and designer two different people. 

There are times when a publisher will tweak a game rule himself, a publisher will suggest rules tweaks, but leave it to the designer to put in the exact implementation. 

The designer is mainly responsible for the rulebook and card text. The publisher will sometimes run both by an editor to make sure there aren't any glaring problems

EDIT: If the game is published in a country other than the designer's home country

Sometimes a publisher will have a *developer* work on balancing the game past what the designer did. A developer makes incremental rules tweaks

Not all publishers do this, and Seth Jaffee with just about every Tasty Minstrel game.

So

* Component quality

* Cost of the game

* Art

* Layout

* Hard-to-understand text (if the game was translated)

If you have problems with any of the following

* Rules balance

* Hard-to-understand text (if the game is in its original language)

* Lots of errata

I was drunk so I might be a little off on the name. This game can be played by anyone with like 8 or so pens and 8 or so pieces of paper.

Basically everyone starts out with a pen and a paper. Everyone then writes a sentence. The sentence can be anything you want. 

Next every one passes the paper to their left. Now on the paper you have received you draw a picture of the sentence on it. Then you fold over the sentence so the next person can't see it and you all pass to the left again. 

The next paper you receive you will write a sentence on it that accurately describes the picture. You fold the paper over the picture so the next player can't see it. Then you again all pass the paper to the left again.  

This process continues until your original paper returns to you. You might want to write your name at the bottom to keep track.(especially if you are drunk). This games purpose is to create laughs. I think the only other time I laughed so hard in a game was ""cards against humanity"". This is the ultimate party game. You should suggest it at your next party.

There has been tons of discussion/debate about this exchange already and I think it's important we get this all in sorted out in a central place sooner rather than later. Most of the confusion is coming from the description of the exchange: 

&gt;If you are into serious board games (not Monopoly) and are looking to expand your collection and share your interest with others, but this one is for board game enthusiasts!

&gt;If that’s you

To those of us in the hobby this probably makes total sense. But for some it may not be so clear. Let's fix that. 

""Serious"" was a poor choice in wording. What would have been more accurate was saying this exchange is focused on (but not exclusive to) **modern, as is [the BoardGameGeek top games list](http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame), and the [most current ""Top 10"" games thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/qcmdh/rboardgames_hot_10_what_boardgames_are_we_playing/) in this very subreddit. None of these should be seen as the be-all-end-all reference for this exchange but are great starting points for what ""serious"" games they were talking about.

Now

I know to some people this subreddit is oozing elitism right now

&gt;Being serious about games is about the same as being serious about literature. You enjoy them, and you discuss and explore them at length. The joy of a board game exchange is knowing that you're going to get something that someone else spent some time playing and considering; that you, yourself, will get to explore that game and discover its intricacies. The reason Monopoly, Sorry, Taboo, or other such games aren't encouraged is simply because there is very little depth in to be plumbed. Sure, but to someone serious about board games

The only other point I'd like to discuss is how the exchange will actually work. No, not receiving. If you are going to be upset that the game you get isn't as valuable as the one you sent, don't sign up. Give what you can and appreciate what you receieve. I don't see why we can't all be mature about that. 

Again

EDIT: There is another common question I would like to address here - used games. **GENTLY** used games (as in never/rarely played, but for others you'd be breaking their heart. Bottom line: if having to put time and effort into finding an appropriate game that you may very well need to spend money on is not something you're interested in, please consider not joining this exchange.

The two earths were trying to invade middle earth while middle earth was trying to 'close the portals' by bringing the ring to Greenland on each map (for some reason). We recognized right off the bat that the game was super imbalanced and started making up extra rules to try to fix it. In the end

Edit: since everyone is asking about the rules

We started with three teams

Because middle earth was at such a disadvantage, Earth 2, Middle Earth. Initially ME was getting twice the reinforcements, then we brought that down to normal numbers per round.

There were a couple other tweaks and changes concerning card rules and heroes

The game only lasted about 4 rounds because by that point it was clear who was going to win (Earth 2 because Middle Earth ignored them in favour of attacking Earth 1,False,self,t5_2qmjp,1375201903.0,,,t3_1jbz3m

Much of the time I've been the teacher and I try to pride myself on my rules explaining ability but many times I've been under prepared and just screwed something up. 

Some recent examples have been:

**Ticket to Ride** - thinking that you could select a card AND build a route in your turn (instead of just one of those)

**Eclipse** - thinking combat just went for one round for each ship and weapon type (i.e. all missiles first then your other weapons by initiative but just once each). It made missiles seem really over powered and it was just 
impossible to kill things (due to the repair at the end of turn)

**Android: Netrunner** - that you had to match the strength of ice to get past it (as runner) at all

Okay enough back story (sort of). I also am a local journalist and the owners of the above place have also done something else really cool. They opened up a restaurant called the [Game Master Grill](http://www.gamemastergrill.com/) that is board gamed themed and I had [to cover it](http://mineola.patch.com/articles/playing-with-your-food-at-game-master-grill) since it was new in town. You can go and get dinner, if you want to take a while go on a slower night and hang out. They'll even deliver a board game with your order. It is a really neat idea and a cool place.  
  
Generally it is a fun store and really nice. The staff will all teach you games. I've ate a couple times there and they helped teach my girlfriend a couple games as well, to play while we waited for our food. They even have a neat zombie dice game! The place hasn't picked up too quickly though and could use more exposure. The owner is a greatguy who worked in the restaurant business for 17 years, got an opportunity to open a board game store a few years ago and took it. He is a veteran, a good guy, and passionate about board games, particularly about teaching people how to play new games. I want to see if I can help the place out by showing you guys a cool place you'd appreciate (maybe spurn a new idea for a restaurateur out there) and get him more exposure. Tell your NY/Long Island buddies about it. Go yourself if you are in the area, check out his site (the menu is super neat and creative with the titles of some dishes).  
  
Again here is the site for the restaurant [Game Master Grill](http://www.gamemastergrill.com/) and this is the, but I wanted to be upfront with my intentions and let everyone know a little more about the place. So thank's again guys for anyone and even if it's only one person chcking it out! PM if you have questions or anything.

On Friday I decided to give it another shot. I set up the FB event and sent it out, figuring that I can at least convert one friend to the dark side. Halfway through the game another shows up, then 3 people, then one of my daughter's friends. I got a little panicky because here I was trapped in a game and I have 5 people sitting around not playing games. As soon as we lost Forbidden Island I stuck my daughter and her friend on it and broke out Carcassonne. I didn't play, and instead walked them through the game, pointing out strategies and possible moves. It was pretty fucking awesome watching everyone get involved and talking about how much fun they were having. 

I did feel bad leaving my daughter and her friend out of the group though so once Carcassonne wrapped up I broke out Elder Signs (the only thing I have besides Arkham Horror that can accomodate 7 people). It was a huge hit. Turns went really smooth and even with the downtime between turns people were staying involved. We beat Cthulhu with 5 doom token left to go. It was pretty late at that point so I sent my daughter and her friend to the small table where they appropriately enough played Small World. I busted out Carcassonne with Inns and Cathedrals

In short it was an awesome night. I introduced 4 new people to an awesome hobby and everyone had a great time. I'm hoping we can make this a regular occurrence because I am aching to get a chance to play Risk: Legacy.

**tl;dr** Night was a resounding success

So I've been really in to board games for a long time.  Since I was a kid I played lots of board games but they kinda fizzled out in high school.  My college happened to have a popular game design program and there I met lots of kids in to some cool board games that I had never heard of.  This is where my love for board games came to light.

Flash forward 8 years later.  I live in NYC and I have never had a solid crew of people to play board games with.  Last Thursday I convinced a friend to come with me to a local games store to check out their ""board game night.""  You can play virtually any game you want or you can sign up for the ""game tutorial"" which is where a guy leads you through the board game of the night.  This night happened to be Betrayal at the House on the Hill.  We loved it and bought it.

Fast forward to Hurricane Sandy.  Some friends come over to play games and wait out the storm.  We played tons of games of Betrayal and Dixit (which I also bought that Thursday night) and had a blast.  Tonight

Nothing like a natural disaster to show people how much board games have progressed since the days of Trouble and Mouse Trap (although I still claim Stratego is an awesome game.)

I decided to play Saul to try out being Admiral.  I realised after we started that I was in a great position because I could declare martial law if I felt that my friend playing the President was a Cylon.  My friend playing Kara decided to play it safe and pretend to be a huge help to us early game despite having gnabbed the Cylon card from the start.  I was unsure of him because of how he responded to some of our crises

Eventually

I'm surprised we survived.  Absolutely love that I got this amazing game for $25 from a fellow Redditor (NoodlePDX).  

We're all excited to play another game in the near future and hopefully get it up to 5 or 6 players next time.  I should be going to a FLGS tomorrow to try out the Pegasus expansion.  :)

How was your first BSG experience? (if you remember it)  Do you prefer being the hero or the Cylon?  I know I want to get a shot at being the Cylon some time.  It looks like a lot of fun.

1375449461.0,1jk8ps,Eclipse Review: One Year Later,boardgameben,81,8,40,"I received Eclipse about a year ago as a birthday gift. Over the course of the year

**Viewed Through a Pinhole**

Eclipse had received quite a bit of acclaim already when I’d first heard of it. But it also carried a hefty price tag. Reviews I heard and read lauded it as a case study in good graphic design. The game designer

Cut to my birthday, in my possession.

**Supermassive Black Hole**

After my first play, though, the game takes time to get to the table.

Play was remarkably accessible in comparison. Teaching the 6 actions of each turn is relatively quick. Combat is best saved for the end, but we all loved it. To quote my friend, “This is what $100 for a game gets you.”

Once you get into the alien races, however, you either get the resources you need and thrive, or you don’t and have to scramble. 

**Solo Eclipse**

At the end of April, and made excellent use of the iPad functionality. Whenever I played it, I truly felt like I might be controlling a futuristic empire from my datapad, a la Emanuel Zorg in the Fifth Element.

However, there’s a definite pattern of actions, especially in the early game. With that said, there are still many alien races I have yet to master. But it was a rough edge on an otherwise spotless game.

**The Expansion and Inevitable Heat Death of the Galaxy**

Since I got Eclipse, I don’t know if I will pick up the larger expansion. I don’t get the game to the table enough to need the variety yet.

The highlight of the game is probably the ship customization. I’ve had ships bristling with missiles

A note on the graphic design: it lives up to the hype. Every component in the game carries valuable information based on where it is or isn’t

**Out of its Shadow**

In conclusion, especially for the aliens, but by the time you’re playing with aliens, you should be able to adapt. In addition, there are a few strategies that can seem automatic, but the randomness of technology curbs these – so the luck is both a blessing and a curse, as luck should be.

This game has become one of the standards by which I compare my own designs. If you have a budget for a big game

tl;dr: Lots to set-up, variety of options and ship customization make Eclipse well worth it. And if you have an iPad, buy the app.

With all the (deserved) love for Netrunner recently I was interested in checking out the original game that started off the universe: ***Android***

Immediately I realized I was looking at a very divisive game; half the reviews slagged it for being not what they were expecting, and vicious, while the other half hailed it as original, misunderstood, and an amazing game.

Nevertheless, I decided that this game was probably up my alley and was in stock at my FLGS for far cheaper than I had anticipated. I was expecting it to cost 80 US$, but I managed to pick it up for 60.

For reference

Anyway

***THE GAME***

Android, each with their own foibles, strengths, and unique game mechanics, and they are in charge of navigating the game's gauntlet of the detective's personal stories, a tangled conspiracy, and, the actual murder.

Time is key. Each turn sees you with a limited number of very simple actions. The game is not complicated because of its rules - there are only 7 available actions - like most thematic games it is complex because of the repercussions of your actions. Is it worth spending the entire day travelling to the moon to follow the evidence trail? Or would your time be better spent around the spires of New Angeles

Yes

***Does Android Dream of Electric Sheep?***

I could talk about the various unique-ities of the game; the movement system

Or the clever evidence mechanic: where following leads finds your detective attempting to contextualize said findings. A bullet in an alleyway may damn a suspect or exonerate him, and proving your Hunches right is worth VP.

Nor am I going to discuss the jigsaw puzzle pieces of the conspiracy

Instead I'm going to talk about, and your Plot.

***Twilight and Shifting***

Each detective has two decks of cards specific to him/her: A Light Deck, which the OTHER players draw from.

In order to play your Light Cards (which are always good), or get some new implants installed. However, doing so will shift your Twilight resource to the dark side, and it becomes significantly more difficult to play Light Cards when your Twilight is shifted to the dark.

How do you shift it back to the light? You play other player's Dark Cards on them.

Dark Cards are never nice. In effect, and it simulates real life getting in the way of your investigation. Car breakdowns, fights, side gigs that have to be dealt with, demands from your father. These obstacles present the core of Android’s conflict, and prevent it from being Cluedo in Space.

***Plots***

Every few days of in game time, causing bad baggage to be placed on your plot) can result in a significant VP boost.

Together, really help to sell and flesh the world of Android. Emotional, funny, and never boring, the writing is an integral part of the story experience. My brother and I were alternately laughing at the cyborg’s confused attempts to paint flames on his hovercycle to ‘increase the top speed’ and sympathizing with the bounty hunter’s painful relationship with her father.

Yes

***Oh yeah

Yeah, no VP. Did I mention you can have hits placed on the suspects you think your fellow players are Hunched towards?

***Short Circuits***

AKA

Android can be vicious. You spend a ton of time chasing the trail, because of baggage placed by other players.

But that's okay

And it's not like you have no recourse; there are multiple ways to gain VP

The game can be long, no dice rolling, no counting tiles. Just decisions, and the consequences of those decisions, and a burning desire to see your detective happy, or if not happy, successful.

And the final

I completely agree; if this were a murder mystery game. It's not. It is a detective movie generator. Viewed from that perspective, by the suspects themselves, all writhe and coil about each other to form an intricate web of story that you and the four other players at the table get to experience together. I broke with my normal habit and abstained from reading any cards that I did not actually play, wanting to squeeze every last drop of surprise and genuine glee from the cards, so dripping are they with detail and love.

***Closing Arguments***

Android is beautiful. It's a tightly interlocking piece of genius. I have never played a game like it. I have never *heard* of a game like it. I wanted to bring it to your attention because I feel, and I wanted to share this heavy box full of elegance and love with all of you. Thank you for reading this far.

I rated the first playthrough (2 players, final score 39-38 VPs) extremely highly, and the game has been burning a hole in my brain ever since. The world of Android sticks with you, the threads of story your detectives carve through that city weave their way into your dreams. I am getting a 5 player game in soon, and I fully expect my friends to absolutely love it.

And one tiny

Familiar with Doom and Descent's somewhat flim-flam writing in the scenario books, say, a prose novel. I do hope, however, that more game designers do follow this trend of having well-written flavor text and seriously invest in hiring proper writers.

Unique assembly of mechanics, complex, diabolical, beautiful. Android, 2008, Fantasy Flight Games. Designer: Kevin Wilson. 9/10.

Me and my bro were bored last night and I was organizing my games. We end up deciding to play AH after watching a review of Mansions of Madness from TheDiceTower. We get in a HP Lovecraft mood.

We set it up

With Yig chosen, the other would force us to pull two Mythos cards for the rest of the game unless we discard 3 spells on French Hill. I quickly sacrifices Thomas my Ally, but we didnt stop the other Rumor in time. We now pull two Mythos cards, but only open a gate with the second. Things just went from bad to worse. We continue to gain momentum, but with two mythos cards being drawn up, the threat level is rising almost every two to three turns. Aliies are dropping like leaves in the fall and the shoppes are closing fast. We reach a Threat of 6 and the Maniacs, who were the easiest to kill, But due to a Mythos card that was pulled that shuffled the deck

Now here's the stuff legends are made of...

Yig curses at the start of battle. I end up cursed, i lost all remaining Sanity points and attack him for 3. My self sacrificing bravery echoes into the abyss I am devoured into. Now it's just my bro in the face of a God. My bro continues his attack, Axe in hand getting his life down to one Doom Token. He blocks an attack with a Wayward Statue and rolls 5 dice with NO SUCCESSES! How can this be possible! The next attack he tries to defend against with only two dice and fails. He now has one life and one sanity left. The next attack it death for sure. The music reaches the height of its track. My brother shakes his 5 dice in his hand. I start cheering him on. ""You can do this"" ""It's all you dude"" ""You can save Arkham, I believe in you!""

 He rolls. 

Every single dice is a failure.....

...EXCEPT ONE! Yig is sent back to the deep abyss from whence he came
