I came across this word and was reminded of a friend who had passed just the other day. We met in an inpatient hospital. I was there because of a suicide attempt and she was there because of her heroin addiction.

I kept thinking of how my mom and dad, acquaintances, and the like would've reacted had I died the day of my attempt. Then I started making up different scenarios of how people would take the news and continue on with their lives.

Then I thought about my friend and how she probably had these thoughts as well. She would think of her own mother and father, and everyone else in between. She enjoyed her own set of childhood pleasures and played tag with the person she had a crush on and put bandages on her scraped knees when she fell on the pavement and felt incredible pain and cried for hours at a time for own reasons.

And so did her father. And the people surrounding his life. Everyone that he's ever interacted with had their own lives just as complex and unique as his and hers and my mother's and mine and yours.

Hell, unreasonable hour took shits. (Fuck them it's 3AM.)

The amalgamated mass of my perception of the collective human consciousness began to unravel and divide and separate into individual specks filled with people's favorite meals and songs that they never got tired of.

We often tend to forget how human we really are. So think about this next time you feel intimidated towards your superior
