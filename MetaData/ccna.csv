1352756709.0,13323l,"Today I scored 937 and 944 on back-to-back ICND1 and ICND2 tests, first attempt. Here's how:",I_Chameleon,79,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/13323l/today_i_scored_937_and_944_on_backtoback_icnd1/
Since my local testing center recently had some sort of falling out with Pearson VUE
  
Here's an important disclaimer: I built my study plan around my own particular circumstances, thanks to recession-induced financial collapse. I earned my A+ and Network+ certs back in 2003, and since then have accumulated what's perhaps the equivalent of 3 full-time years of semi-relevant work experience. I knew enough, for example, about ping, tracert and ipconfig, but hardly anything about subnets
  
There are two more important details. By the time I began to prepare for my CCNA, I wasn't in an un(der)employment-fueled mad rush. Also, I decided to go the two-exam route to ""bank"" my intellectual investment, so to speak. That said, here is the plan I settled on:  
  
Phase 1: I read Lammle's study guide. Specifically, or even spend much time lost in thought about unfamiliar topics. This wasn't skimming, per se; instead, I truly read the entire book, and only stopped to re-read parts when basic reading comprehension eluded me (i.e. upon encountering poorly-worded sections or sleep-induced idiocy). The take-home message here is not to stress over parts that seem strange. Instead, just let them stew.  
  
Phase 2: I re-read Lammle's study guide. This time, I also read the hands-on labs. However, my sheer infantile impatience and motivatonal inertia prevented me from actually doing them, despite having already installed Cisco Packet Tracer.  
Here's the gist of my note-taking strategy: I produced a summary of Lammle's book that doesn't contain Lammle's ""bonus commentary"". I was left with fairly cut-and-dry facts and IOS commands that were much easier to use as reference material.  
  
Phase 3: I compiled every IOS command mentioned in Lammle's study guide into a handy-dandy reference hierarchy (tree structure). The tree's root was ""USER EXEC MODE"", so that, for example, both [""ip"" -&gt; ""interface"" -&gt; ""brief""] and [""cdp"" -&gt; ""neighbors""] would branch off of the ""show"" node. The upshot: it's easier to remember interrelated pathways that traverse concisely-named nodes than long and perhaps seemingly-unrelated commands. I used MindJet, my favorite mapping program, but there's no reason why you can't do this with any other mind-mapping program, or indentations in any text editor
  
Phase 4: I watched Jeremy Cioara's CBT Nuggets videos for ICND1 and ICND2. While sticklers for grammar, which helps, and it fills many of the lacunae left by Lammle. Highly recommended.  
  
Phase 5: I experimented with simulators and emulators. I found Cisco Packet Tracer easier to use than GNS3, I found one that worked best for me. I would start with two hosts attached to one switch and configure a functional LAN. This covered base configurations, followed by IP addressing and VLANS. I then moved up to a router-on-a-stick by adding one router, and then added more routers to practice routing and WAN technologies. While I enjoyed this ""bottom-up"" approach more than a ""top-down"" sequence (starting from a pair of routers connected point-to-point), do what feels right to you.  
  
Phase 6: I attempted all the practice questions I could get my hands on. While nearly all of them were multiple-choice questions, after you've gained a strong understanding of more basic principles and theory. It's your exam-prep dessert, and not an appetizer like Phase 1 was.  
  
The result: over 93% on both tests
  
And now for some much-needed shut-eye...

1367972765.0,1dwdn6,Passed 640-802 a week ago..I wanted to post up my subnetting cheat sheet incase it can help anybody.,obviousboy,44,4,14,"So I passed this pain in the *ss exam with a 945/1000 and I would say a big help in this was my cheat sheet. Though on the 640-802 there was limited actual subnetting questions it was extremely nice to be able to cross out bogus answers by quickly eliminating them with this. This was paramount on questions with network diagrams


So here it is [Cheat Sheet](http://i.imgur.com/LNKrys3.jpg?1)

Yes its hand drawn


The main factor I wanted with a cheat sheet was that I only wanted to remember a very small group of things going in. I knew I was going to be nervous and I didn't want to be trying to recall to much and stumbling out of the gate.

**So to create it all I needed to know was the following:**

1)How to divide 128 by 2 then take its result and divide by 2 again. Honestly going into these exams you will know this step forwards and backwards :)

2)Take 255 and start subtracting it in reverse order 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 from it. That gives you all that jazz. ex 255 - 1 = 254...254 - 2 = 252...252 - 4 = 248...and so on

3) Fill in your 1s and 0s. You will remember how it should look.

4)Your 3 mnemonic phrase 

-All People Seem To Need Data Processing

-tcp in A TIN cup (A TIN is what you care about)

-Did Sally Pack For Bermuda

5)Powers. 

Quick Note...All of this is simple but DO NOT RUSH IT..one simple mistake in your powers table like a 1048 instead of 1024 will cause you grief. Also keep it neat as you dont want to be second guessing things on it.


**How to use it.**

This chart represents a starting point of a class C

Ex1) What is the broadcast for 192.168.144.0 255.255.255.224??

-Scroll down the left hand column until you find 224 move over to the right until the last '1' in the row and lookup. You got 32

Ex2) What valid host range is the ip address 10.128.3.233/20 a part of??

-For this one you start counting from left to right from 17 (Everything 16 and less is on the imaginary chart to your left). Since a /20 falls on 16 you know the range you just need remember to exclude the first and last (10.128.0.1 and 10.128.15.254). For Class B start counting from 17

Ex3) How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you get from the network 10.0.0.0 255.255.240.0?

-Scroll down the left hand column until you find 240 now scroll right until you hit a 0

Introduction  
&gt;First off, and practice info submitted by the faithful redditors here. Though I've never posted, I troll /r/ccna a every day, and your thoughts definitely contributed to my passing this exam. Know this, 2 months ago my knowledge of networking was zilch. I knew absolutely nothing. This test can be overcome by people with little to no understanding in networking, it just takes practice. The advantages I had were the fact that I work Help Desk and have two very talented network engineers guiding me through the cert/learning/understanding process. Also, I had access to older Cisco routers they weren't using.

Materials and Software I used
&gt;I used Lammle's book exclusively for theory. For lab setup I bought the 841 without wireless just to familiarize myself with the CLI, and it showed in my knowledge of switching. I had to review STP, VTP, and port security an awful lot the last week before my test. The genetics lottery did bless me with a decent memory though, and I find that memory is a core component of the CCNA. Networking is a contrived concept, it is a series of standards, protocols, and software/hardware developed by human beings. It is important to recognize that a lot of things in networking were simply decided that way. My math professor used to call this the White House rule. The White House is white because it's white. Or something like that... 

Cisco commands
&gt;I recommend keeping a google doc or a notebook filled with the most vital cisco commands you come across

    ip address //used frequently
    show ip route // good to verify your routing setup
    show run //just use this all the time
    copy run start //save your changes to nvram when you're done!

Know everything?
&gt; 
Everybody says, Frame Relay? WTF) It's ridiculous how broad this exam really is. I'm glad they're changing it, because the 640-802 covers so much. And my survey responses reflected that ;)
    
Is subnetting really that important?
&gt;As far as the most important topic to know? The obvious answer is subnetting. But most people stop right there, no subnetting: no CCNA. The reason he says these things is because so many topics and, consequently, questions on the 640-802 stem from your understanding of proper IP addressing, and subnetting is at the core of IP addressing. 

Tips and tricks for subnetting?
&gt;Know them in your head, and has a corresponding wildcard of 0.0.0.15. Know the difference between a wildcard and a mask. Know that the amount of usable IP addressing is block size - 2. Here's my little tip for Class B subnetting: I don't know how to explain this well, but, here goes. Ok. So say you're given the subnetwork 172.16.0.0 /20, and you want to find the last usable address in this subnet. I found the best way to do this in my head was to add 8 to the prefix-length, giving us 28. So the block size for the third octect will be the block size that would be in the fourth octet with a /28 prefix on a class C address. So the last usable IP address in the subnetwork 172.16.0.0 /20 is 172.16.15.254 (remember that the last IP address is the broadcast address. See what I did there? I added 16 to the third octect and subtracted 2 from the last octet to account for the network address of the next subnetwork and the broadcast address of this subnetwork. If that makes no sense whatsoever, and I'm sure it may not, if you're asked about a /29 prefix. You just divide 16 by 2 and you have 8. Or if you're given a /27 you just multiply by 2 and you have 32. Then use your respective block sizes to find the mask. There's no reason to memorize masks, therefore the mask is 255.255.255.240. Know that wildcards are just 1 less than the block size associated with the subnet. Know that the last ip address in a subnetwork is the broadcast address. Cisco loves to test your knowledge of this by frequently applying broadcast addresses to interfaces and then ask you why it's not working. Cisco also loves to trick you up with the first IP address in a subnetwork. The first IP address is reserved for the subnetwork address, and it will come. I didn't know a thing about subnetting two weeks ago

Non technical related tips and tricks
&gt;If you're self studying, I would not be a CCNA right now. Also, bring two forms of ID to the test. I almost forgot to do this, I was lucky they accepted a credit card as the second form of ID.

Other thoughts
&gt;Besides knowing subnetting, I had to apply my knowledge of ACL in a sim. You never know what Cisco will throw at you. Know your subnetting, know your weakness, study hard, study early, study often, and you'll pass the CCNA.

   I like CBT because the videos are all under an hour and Jeremy is a good teacher. I was not happy with TrainSignal, there are others,I recommend watching a sample before you buy. 

2. Get some practice tests. I used testkingworld and it was exactly like what I saw during the real test. By taking practice tests you are ready for the types of questions asked on the exam. For example: you may be able to subnet but can you look at a network diagram with 8 devices and quickly tell which one is not on the same subnet as everything else? 

3. Home lab.  Home labs are nice but not essential to passing, configure it, make VLAN's, have fun. If you feel that you need more, then buy everything else.

- Eat breakfast!

edit: One more piece of advice - go to a somewhat well-known or controlled testing facility (like a community college) if you can.  I arrived at the testing...facility (Network Technology Academy in Somerville, so I had to start the test at 930 and stressed out the entire time about my meter running out.  He then took me to a computer lab and closed the door with no formal procedural introduction, so in theory, it was an environment where someone could've easily put a ""cheat sheet"" or test materials in their pocket or wallet and just carried it in.  The entire experience was *incredibly* unprofessional, and that's just one more thing you don't need right before you take the ICND1.

The test was pretty much what I expected. With all the hype

I went through the Cisco Networking Academy and finished over a year ago. I was working 52 hours a week at the time while taking 5 classes and I didn't get as much from the courses as I should have. A couple months ago I decided to start studying for the exam, the teacher was boring and I became almost uninterested in computer networking. CBT Nuggets rejuvenated my interest in it; Jeremy is an awesome guy. I also used the books I had left over from the courses (4 of them) and most recently I got the Todd Lamle 640-802 book. I used packet tracer a lot. I got a couple routers and a switch from Ebay but admittedly I've only messed around on the 2950 switch so far. 

As others have said time and time again, it's definitely a good idea to have it there; it only takes a few minutes to write it out at the beginning of the exam. I didn't write it during the tutorial because I was too afraid that I'd get in trouble for it since the actual exam hadn't started (I found that people have had mixed experiences with this depending on the location).

Good luck to anyone who plans to take the exam. Tomorrow I'll begin studying for the ICND2

I'm looking to sit my CCENT on the 21st. I understand IOS I can setup a switch and router in my sleep and I'm very confident with the IOS and networking parts but subnetting is kicking my ass.

I've always been horrible at math I understand the binary and all that jazz and I've gotten down to the point that the ""magic number"" method really works for me. When its Class C its a breeze but class A and B are much more challenging. I'm also having a problem where it asks ""What is the first valid host on this subnet"" 

Then its just a random number and I can figure out how to find the incrementing number but how do I quickly do it for exam purposes?  same goes with ""How many hosts and subnets does X address have?"" 

I'm understanding the fundamentals of subnetting and getting it when it comes to class C networks but B and A are so much tougher can you please provide any advice? I've been using subnettingquestions.com for practice.

I graduated college in 2010 and have since been kicking around the Odom books promising myself I would get certified. After realizing how much interest I took in networking (and reading lots of the posts in /r/networking) I finally hunkered down and took the test. 

Studying: First thing I did was read Odom's book cover to cover. I admit his materials are VERY dry and read much like a manual. The first couple times reading through his book I lost interest mid chapter and often had to reread whole sections before it started to sink in. I eventually bought a sub to the CBT nuggets videos and reach each chapter in correspondence with the CBT nuggets videos to reinforce the info. By the time I was ready for the test I could open any chapter and be able to answer the ""Do you already know this"" questions and skim the chapter and know exactly what each section referred to. 

Test: I had a somewhat unique experience with the test I hope no one has to go through

Also, hit back and return to previous questions to review. If I had a chance to review I might have been able to score higher, but again due to my technical difficulties I might have just simply missed the chance at the end of the test.

The part that killed my score were the SIM questions

ICND2 Studying: My plan is to give my brain a week of rest and schedule the ICND2 a month from now. For me it's a lot harder to procrastinate studying when I know I have the test date looming. Odom book/CBT nuggets will be how I study for the second test.

	-Feasible Distance (FD) - best metric
	-Reported/Advertised Distance(AD) - Reported distance by neighbor
	-Raw material from which routes are selected

-Neighbor Table - stored in RAM, uses sequence #'s to match ack's with update packets
	-H field indicates order of neighbor discovery
	-Hold is how long the router will wait for a hello packet for that specific neighbor 	-Uptime is how long adjacency has been up
	-SRRT=Smooth Round-Trip timer - time for round trip to and from that neighbor (expected receipt of multicast reply
	-RTO=Retransmission Time Out - time to wait before retransmitting a packet from the retransmission queue to a neighbor

-TONS of subnetting questions and questions that required subnetting - be quick on these.  
-Dispiste the description of materials covered by the new ICND1 there were no mention of OSPF or routing protocols at all on the test  
-Nary a mention of ipv6 despite my study (i was disappointed really).  
-More than a few quesstions that simply required knowledge of what  happens to mac addresses as they get forwareded thru network.  
-Static routing  
-Basic security stuff - like how to encrypt passwords protect telnet etc.  
-Some very general NAT questions.   
-very basic yet trickily worded questions about access lists (know your extended lists too)

1362686809.0,19v4o3,CCNA Changes + Exam Timing?,AllThatJazz,17,1,9,"So with rather strong rumors circulating that Cisco will be making significant changes to the CCNA exam this summer... 

it seems that there are 2 strategies those of us who are studying now could use to deal with this. 

But neither strategy sounds ideal to me: 

________

1) RUSH TO DO EXAMS? 

In the first strategy we could just rush and try to do the current 2 CCNA exams now

But the problem I see with that approach

Obviously if Cisco is going to change the exam

So if I rush to do the current exams

Also ""rushing"" through the knowledge and studying process now


________


2) DELAY AND WAIT FOR NEW MATERIAL? 

So instead of killing ourselves

But ""delaying"" and ""waiting"" and waffling too much is usually never a good approach to accomplishing important life goals! 

So while I do want to take my time to properly absorb and learn the material (and also learn the new exam material) I also don't want to go to the other extreme of delaying things too far into the future. 


________



3) ANOTHER PROBLEM:

Finally... another problem with ""waiting"" and ""delaying"" is that we don't know how long it will take for authors, to come up with new material that covers the new exam in a very good way. 

So for example if I say,"" and Cisco announces their changes in the summer, but it takes authors and curriculum planners until the fall/end of the year to adequately cover the changes, then I've put off my dreams/future for yet another year! 


________


CONCLUSION:
It's never an easy thing to get caught in the middle of a transition like this. 

It kinda sucks

But at some point Cisco has to update the exam

I think the only strategy I can really use is just to keep pushing forward

1369323268.0,1ewp2o,Question: Split Horizon with Poison Reverse,MrRiddell,14,2,2,"I understand the purpose of split horizon

Here is my current understanding for a network with two connected RIPv2 routers.

If a route off RouterA fails:

1. RouterA removes the route from its routing table
2. RouterA sends a triggered update to RouterB for the failed route with a metric of 16
3. RouterB updates its routing table for the failed route
4. RouterB suspends it's split horizon rules and sends a triggered update back to RouterA
5. RouterA updates its routing table for the failed route
6. The route is removed from both routers once there respective timers expire

Writing down those steps has given me a thought:

Is split hoizon with poison reverse useful to account for the fact that RouterA has removed the failed route from it's routing table thereby exposing it to a routing update from say RouterC which would have a route to the failed route? So the poison reverse is to make sure the RouterA has a metric 16 entry in it's routing table as soon as possible? But then again RouterC would also have received a triggered update so wouldn't have any reason to advertise the route...

Some takeaways from the test...

There is a lot of build up that may wrack your nerves.  Try not to worry, but you know them.  If you have studied adequately, you'll know it.

SUBNET IN YOUR HEAD

Cisco will try to ""psyche you out"".  Expect it, and knock the question out.  READ THE QUESTIONS SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY.  They are sometimes worded in a way that can throw you off, using the words ""best"" or ""fastest"".

My question: why are you allowed to specify the port that way?  How is it different from specifiying it at the end?  Finally

This is all for the 640-822 exam

These are the materials I used:

1. CBTNuggets video series for ICND1 - If you are just starting out and want to firmly grasp the concept of what a network is and how it works

2. Wendell Odom's ICND1 book [click here for link to buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/CCENT-ICND1-640-822-Official-Edition/dp/1587204258/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366219367&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=wendell+odom) - This book covers all the material you need. This is a great book for study and one of the main reasons is

3. www.subnettingquestions.com - This was used to practice my subnetting until I got it down with ease. 

4. [some packet tracer lab simulations](http://www.packettracernetwork.com/packettracer53labs.html) this is to test your knowledge on CLI commands and configurations.

I also want to thank everyone in here for the advice I got

I will say to KNOW your subnetting and your show commands(the command and an understanding of what it shows) for the exam! I cannot stress that enough.

First of all a great thank you for having this subreddit. It immensely helped me with some key issues and doubts.


Today feels like a new day to be honest. 

I was able to finish the exam in under 45 mins. It was 48 questions and about 90 mins total. I scored 920/1000. 

For those wondering

I cannot urge you more to go through the content on there. I don't remember any question on the exam that in some shape or form was not discussed on 9tut.

My study materials mostly consisted of the following ( here I am also mildly reviewing what is good and where)

CBT Nuggets


Trainsignal. I feel this is good for everything else other than subnetting. Pay good attention. Detailed and helpful



INE. Good, SPT) are very detailed.

9TUT. You could study all you want with those videos, when you have about 1 week left for your exam. They have users regularly updating what was there on the exam. The content is good, but I think you should go through some of the comments on each topic. Might help you, might also clear some of your doubts


Books. HAHA - None. 

Practice. GNS3 and Packet Tracer. GNS3 for everything but Spanning tree. For Spanning tree I had no option but PT. 

Some hints I can give are

. shortcut for commands are quick and most of them worked in the simulations

. learn the cbt subnetting method. very easy. Also I used to spend 1 hr couple of times a week here http://www.subnettingquestions.com/ Very helpful. I can subnet/answer a question in under 15 seconds. 

. do not forget the routing metrics and how the routing protocols calculate routes. There was an EIGRP question that dealt with metrics. I saw it on 9tut



Mostly folks, its not a small amount but I went prepared, that the 300 I am paying was for the experience, pass or fail. 

I hope this helps some of you. I definitly do not remember all the questions

I did poorly on the SIM's in ICND1 so I got into a habit of having packet tracer open during the videos and going through same configurations are Jeremy.

Here's what I did 3 years ago:

- Took a course at a local university designed to prepare for the test.  I didn't find it terribly helpful, it would probably be a good bet to get you started.

- Read the chapters of the Lammle combined CCNA book that I thought pertained to the 822 exam: not easy.  There's a lot of detail in that book that's not required for this exam but is useful to know and helps toward the ultimate goal of CCNA.  The book itself is very well written

- Failed with a 690/1000.  

Here's where I feel the need to explain my mistake.  I pretty much gave up.  I read the Lammle book half-heartedly again over the next few years

I use Cisco switches at work (network admin)

So then 2 weeks ago I was like 'god damn it this is killing me'.  I did the following to prepare for the test

- I got a book out of the library - the CCENT Walker and Walker book.  The material was a review, it was fine. For my situation it was 7/10, for the general CCENT candidate, however, I would rate it as 5/10.

- I read that sucker cover to cover.  Did all the tests: got about 11-13/15 on them - not great. 

- I got the [certified4less](http://www.getcertified4less.com/) exam voucher + practice test combo, I had problems with the Transcender material.  For one thing, there's a bunch of stuff they don't tell you.  You need Windows, for one thing.  The core product is a Windows installer into which you load the test pack, all downloaded from the site.  There's a web module, but it requires - get this - Internet Explorer.  The flash cards are difficult to use, the interface is very poorly designed, confusing wording, I didn't tell you there are only 4 tests?  4/10 would not recommend.

1375815418.0,1jtv05,To Everyone Who Struggles With Subnetting:,NyghtSpydr,10,1,5,"I, and at times I have found the solution that best helps me, because a lot of times I get confused with explanations from people who understand this completely. 

Simply put

What I mean by this is if you remember the block sizes

Example:

Say you have a /21 CIDR netmask. What this means is that the first two octets are all turned on (255.255.) and the third octet is where you will be concentrating on figuring out the subnet. 
 
The first two octets will take up 16 bits
 
So you take those 5 bits and use the subnet cheat sheet (you should remember at least this part in your head) to determine the Block Size. 
 
Mask Bits: 128  64  32  16  **8**  4  2  1

Our Bits:     1    2    3   4   **5**
 
Now
 
Let's look at an example again:
 
192.168.127.60 /21
 
=
 
255.255.248.0
 
So
 
0, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 112
 
Notice that our target IP of 127 falls into the range of 120-128. 
 
The first number (120) is your Network ID
 
BAM! That's it! That is the EASIEST way to understand subnetting in your head. There are many other ways to understand this
 
Another tip to consider is memorizing the block size increments

240 mask: 0, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160

248 mask: 0, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 112

(Credit to /u/getonthebag ) 

You should also memorize the most common subnet masks for quick recall. There are only a handful of masks that are used commonly


128, 240, 248, 252, 253, 255


One more thing, that is because there are multiple octets. See [THIS](https://kb.wisc.edu/ns/page.php?id=3493) link for more information on this.

It was my intention to run one as a R&amp;S rack, or a Voice rack(CME 8.6,CUCM, Unity). Eventually, it could have all three. Because I'm a geek, when the voice rack goes in, it will have remote access to a camera to view the phone screens (probably two 7960's.)

a) both boson and cisco
b) only boson
c) only cisco
d) boson

To my understanding (and after testing in a lab) it is absolutely possible to log onto this router (albeit only to user mode) via a console cable without being prompted for a password. However

Am I misunderstanding the term 'log in' or am I not truly logged in until I have reached privileged level?

i was hoping someone would be able to help me understand or at least point me in the right direction to figure out the answer. i really just want to understand the concept before moving on.

here is the information i have and then following that is the information i need to input for the topology:

&gt; s0/0/0: 192.168.20.242 | 255.255.255.252

so i'm asked to do this:

&gt; ·         Configure US-PC2 with the last IP address in the US-R2 subnet.

&gt; ·         Configure the Fa0/1 interface on US-R1 with the last IP address in the subnet.

i figure i'd use the last address in the fa0/0 for US-R2 so i think pc2's IP would be ""192.168.20.95 | 255.255.255.224""

but i have NO idea what to put for fa0/1 in the US-R1 topology.

I'm literally at the very beginning

The company I work for are moving office within the next 3 weeks to a new building that supplies internet &amp; a network already within the building.  The idea behind it is you come in and you can plug your computer into the Ethernet point on the wall and you are ready to work away.

Our current setup is something like this...

fibre router --&gt; apple airport --&gt; 24 port switch --&gt; 22 devices then connected to this

the 22 devices would be:

- 8 Cisco VOIP Phones (these plug-in to the network point on the wall
- 2 Network Printers
- 1 MAC Mini File Server
- 1 Backup Server
- 5 MACS
- 5 PCS

So in the new place we are basically going to be creating a private network within the overall network.

As far as I'm aware the new building has a patch panel room which then distributes the internet all over the building.

I'm going to take a guess that for us to create a private network in the network we will need to have a router off their patch panel into a switch which we will then plug-in all of our own devices some of which will have static ips and some which will be supplied via DHCP.  We will have be given an IP which has a different host? so that no one else can access our computers/servers.

Is this correct? Is my theory behind this correct? Terminology may be a bit rough lol

Host at each end
    
Hosts will be able to communicate if they're on the same IP network

In CCNA Discovery exams multiple answer questions would have the additional instruction of ""Choose Two"" or ""Choose all that apply"" or ""Choose 3.""  On the Odom/Pearson IT practice exams there is no additional instruction for these questions.  How is it formatted on the CCNA exam?

::1 is the abbreviated notation for the loopback address

:: is the abbreviated notation for the unspecified address

It's pretty clear to me the the 0's are always going to be 0's in a loopback address and unspecified address but with other address types you have ranges and I'm unsure of what the ranges are and what ranges will be tested.

So for example Multicast high order bits are FF (1111 1111) and I take that to mean the Multicast range is from:

7) Familiar with OSPF and I have run multiple area OSPF in my home lab between sites with GRE tunnels. I feel pretty darn comfortable with OSPF. Know the defaults and differences between hello and dead timers.    
8) I know the basics of EIGRP. I don't use it much because I am in a multi-vendor environment lab at home. I know the parameters for neighbor relationships, successors, etc. I still feel fuzzy on this simply because I have not used it as intimately as OSPF.

Due to this I have started recommending that hopeful CCNAs take the test before they think they are ready. I think the $300 investment into the test is well worth it

**TIME SAVINGS**  

Taking the CCNA and failing will give you an excellent picture of what you can improve and what you already know. This will help you prioritize your hours when you study

**MONEY SAVINGS** 

On of my NOC guys spend $500 to $1000 on routers, the Layer 2 stuff caught him off guard, especially the early Layer 2 lab, and it threw him for the rest of the test, by eating up too much time and shaking his confidence. Had he taken the test, I think he could have spend less money to acquire gear to help him pass what he was weak at. 

**YOU GET TO LEARN THE TEST** 

The test is weird, causing them to do slightly worse than expected. Do bring foam earplugs, some places have them to hand out, other locations don't mind if you have them STILL IN THE WRAPPER. This will help you keep your focus if you are easily distracted by noise. 

**YOU DO NEED TO FAIL WELL**  

Bring a notepad with you, including the notepad and write down everything that was a problem, as much as you can. Write down as much as you can remember about the lab questions, and what was easy or hard about them. 

Note your weaknesses

I just took yet another practice exam and missed 2 questions on it that I'm not sure why I missed...

http://i.imgur.com/04Vswr6.jpg  
This question I answered A (which would give me 4 equal sized subnets) but they wanted F (which gives 8 equal sized subnets).  By the question I see that they want 1 subnet each for the 2 VLANs on SwitchC and SwitchD (2 total subnets) 1 subnet for the LAN off RouterA (3 total subnets) and 1 subnet for the link between RouterA and RouterB (4 total subnets)  

Where did I go wrong on this one?  Is it something to do with the ""ip subnet zero"" not being enabled?  What does that mean?

http://i.imgur.com/HXJOmWx.jpg

The obvious answer here for me is B and F as they are the only devices with public addresses however it asks for 3 choices.  I originally put C as well because it wont accept only 2 answers but the correct answer is B

Today I scraped through the 640-802 with 841/1000.

Been using this subreddit a lot over the past six weeks

Anyway

The first thing I did was just book the exam. I booked it on 1st May and have just studied with almost all of my free time since. On average

I ordered Wendell Odom's CCNA Certification Library: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1587204371/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

I'd say reading through those books and working through all the extra material with it was the most useful resource.
I also used the CBT Nuggets video series. I found Jeremy Cioara was a breathe of fresh air when reviewing topics; something about the way he teaches really gets you motivated to start labbing after having read the really complex details in the book.

I did my research and built a CCNA lab

Here's the lab:
http://imgur.com/JXwoGAO

For info

I also used Packet Tracer to create a huge lab involving all the different technologies (frame relay, VLANs, STP etc etc).

To practice subnetting

Having done the CCNA before, so find a way you like (and that works!) and just keep practicing with it. If you're gonna sit the single CCNA exam I would say you need to be pretty snappy with it though.

What I did in the last week was activate the exams that came with Wendell Odom's library. These were super useful

That pretty much sums up everything I used to learn the material. 

My thoughts on the actual exam... it was _hard_. I found it very difficult anyway. I had two labs to work through

**It was incredibly easy and took 30 minutes if you have the stuff laying around! It's also pretty cheap.**

**[SETUP DIAGRAM](http://imgur.com/6qSMg5Q)**

My network lab isn't connected to my home network in any way as I make a ton of changes while practicing for my CCNA. I thought about connecting them to manage the stuff

###Here is what you need:

1. [USB&gt;Serial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) adapters for each device in your lab (or enough serial ports )
2. An old computer fast enough to run a Linux distribution. 

  **(I used Ubuntu Server 12.10...and that's how I'll write this tutorial for)**
3. Enough USB ports for all your devices.

  **(I used a Hub to make the setup as clean as possible. I'd reccommend a powered hub if you have boat loads of devices)**

You can obviously do the wiring any way you want...like using console cables instead of the DB9/RJ45 adapters like I did. **[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/19odee/cisco_rollover_cable_your_services_are_no_longer/)** is the post on how to to wire the adapters.

I used **[these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)** USB/Serial Adapters since they were cheap and they worked without effort in Ubuntu 12.10.

###**Here are the steps I took:**

1. Hook it all up

2. Install Ubuntu Server 12.10 on the PC.

  **(I made my hostname AccessServer...I also selected to OpenSSH Server option when presented with tasksel)**

3. Install the software to make the magic happen (ser2net)

  Here are the terminal commands I used...**[this](http://cciedynamips.wordpress.com/category/6-installing-setting-up-ser2net/)** and **[this](http://mellowd.co.uk/ccie/?tag=ser2net)** will probably help you.

**Update your packages:**

    sudo apt-get update

**Install ser2net**

    sudo apt-get install ser2net

**Determine the names of your serial ports**
  
My built in ports were ttyS0 (serial) and ttyS1 (parallel).

My USB/Serial adapters were ttyUSB0

    dmesg | grep tty

**Edit the config file in a text editor**

    sudo nano /etc/ser2net.conf

**Modify the end of the file**

This is what mine looked like...I used all USB adapters to make the physical wiring nice and clean

    2000:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2001:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB1:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2002:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB2:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2003:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB3:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    ...

Press Ctrl+O to write the file

**Restart ser2net so the changes are there**

    sudo /etc/init.d/ser2net restart

**All Done! Now test via telnet from another computer on your LAN**

    telnet AccessServer [port]

Use the port number that lines up with the tty device you typed into the config file. I like to use SecureCRT and keep sessions open with all devices in tabs.

You could make a few changes to the setup if you want to access the server remotely

**I simply did this to remove wires from my apartment and make it so I only need to get up for topology changes. Changes to router/switch configurations no longer disconnect me. Think of it as a local out-of-band management**

**Enjoy!!!**

Basically
I started attending the Cisco netacad at my local community college in the Fall and hope to have my CCNA in hand by May. I felt this was a better route &lt;--- Network humor --- than just braindumpping for an exam. The program really does push you and I have logged about 300 hours in the lab working mostly on 2900 series switches and 2600 series routers and feel that I am really getting a good foundation in networking - I've made A's through fundamentals and routing and am holding down an A in switching . In addition I've also been able to take some security classes and plan on getting my Security+ around May around the same time I get the CCNA and eventually a CCNA Security. 
So basically what I'm curious about is how marketable is that kind of skill set in a rather large market like DFW and secondly what kind of job should I aim for. I am certainly not above starting at the bottom and working my way up in the industry but at the same time my wife is on my back to get out there and make money.

I want to take the test asap and try again but its hard for me to re-read and go over my notes on those sections. I felt like I knew it enough but apparently not. Any quick tips or helpful guides to remembering important details in those sections?

Also one question was bothering me from the test... I believe it was a router pinging another router and the first ping results showed:

3/5 packets successful

and then they ping it again and get

!!!!!
5/5 packets sucessful

I've been taking all the practice tests I can find on the Cisco site, I'm comfortable with command line and configuring switches, routers, routing protocols, VLANs, sub-interfaces and security settings. My weakness is creating ACLs and setting up NAT. I can look at an ACL and understand it but I have trouble with the actual writing part.

It's all a bit confusing. What's the point in the Netacad exams that we had to take in exam centres if they give no cert? The fact these exams are from Cisco and I got a generic letter from the Cisco CEO and a certificate is a little misleading.

I am currently studying for the CCNA and I am having a hard time wrapping my head around the difference between secondary IP addressing and VLANS(with router on a stick topology).

-Both create separate subnets
-Both have their connected hosts send frames to their default gateway to reach the other subnet

Obviously you can create many more VLANs than just two but is that the only advantage VLANs have on secondary addressing. If I have a network that requires only two subnets on the same interface why would I choose VLANs over secondary addressing? Or would I?

Just a little background, but I was very excited to get into the material.  After teaching it for the past month and a half, I have to say that I may enjoy networking more than any other IT field.  I do have a couple of questions though so try not to judge me, as I have only been doing this for  a month and a half haha(I am getting certified as a Cisco Instructor and I am probably going to take the CCNA this summer)

Anywho, and routing protocols.  I have in my possession 14 computers, 3 layer 2 Cisco switches (can't think of the model at the moment), and a couple of 1800 series routers.  We have an open fiber connection that is connected to our football field that I would like the kids to use.  We have cable ran to the school that is connected to a Cisco small business router (basically a home networking router), and a layer 2 switch.

Here is what I would like to do.  I would like to have 7 computers on one switch, how to simulate a WAN connection, and how to assign IP addresses dynamically and statically.  The problem I am worried about is twofold:  Setting up NAT with the routers, and IP address conflicts.  Should I (or do I have to) let the small business router deal with the NAT and IP assigning (currently the small business router dynamically assigns IP addresses to the 3 computers it is connected to), and if I do that, what commands do I have to put in my 1800 series routers in order to successfully forward traffic to the small business internet router.  Should I, instead, but maybe you can help me!

tl;dr - I need to set up a small network of 14 computers

UPDATE:

Ok I got the packet tracer set up just the way I want it.  I think I have figured out

I know people need to make money, I don’t feel bad when I could scan every page of the book, that I’ve paid for, and make a pdf for free.

2x Cisco 2611xm Routers
1x Cisco 2950 Switch 
1x Cisco 3570 Switch
2x WIC-T1-DSU/CSU Card
1x BRI-U1 Card
1x Console Cable
1x Crossover Cable
2x Patched Cables

Is there anything else I need? Am I missing cables? Should I be worried about having WIC-T1-DSU/CSU cards instead of the WIC-T1 Serial card? Do I need the BRI card? He is giving me all this for dirt cheap and they all work.. He is just a cisco reseller

Also

update:
