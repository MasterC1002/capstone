FYI: I recommend having at least a Dual-Core processor

**Step 1**: Download this: http://www.supermodel3.com/Download.html (Select the appropriate version).

**Step 2**: Extract the .zip contents somewhere (Desktop

**Step 3**: Download this: http://coolrom.com/roms/mame/9864/The_Lost_World.php (lostwsga.zip).

**Step 4**: DO NOT EXTRACT lostwsga.zip. Simply place it in the same directory as the Supermodel directory you extracted.

**Step 5**: Create a shortcut of the Supermodel.exe file
    ""D:\Supermodel 0.2a x64\Supermodel.exe"" *lostwsga.zip -fullscreen -res=1024
        

**NOTE** ""D:\Supermodel\Supermodel.exe"" is where I have my Supermodel directory. So you do not need to change this part. This will load the game automatically in fullscreen at the specified resolution (1024 X 768).

The game should load up and you can play! The ""1"" key is for ""Start Player 1""


Have fun! And if you run into any issues

I was thinking of a mix of state of decay with dinosaurs set in a jungle island. In case you don't know about state of decay

Recently released, all who have different abilities and sets of skills. You can use melee weapons or guns to kill zombies or use stealth to remain unseen. A fight with a zombie could attract more and end up getting your character killed. Either way, you must scavenge for resources in abandoned houses and manage the ones you already have. So now that I've given you a gameplay summary of State of Decay and I'll move into Jurassic Park of Decay and trust me It's right up your alley!

Imagine you are in group of survivors, water, medicine, etc to stay alive. You and the group must go out and get the things you need. The reasoning for their situation is unclear but becomes more of a problem and causes fights between the survivors. It's up to you to make sure everything is going smoothly (or smoothly as can be) to keep everyone alive. The main problem with your current location is the proximity to the center of the island. Carnivorous dinos are lurking waiting to strike for their next snack. 

You must move quickly if you want to survive. The issue is the farther you move from the island's center, lack of sleep, etc. Fear not. There would be many ways to keep your group alive. 

While scavenging for prepackaged food, just not as anyone would know it. Dino meat is meat. How you get it is question? Quietly stalk your prey or go out in some of Ingen's loud and old roundup vehicles? Be careful though! Noise attracts predators and there is nothing stopping a T-rex from chomping on your vehicle. While a T-rex may be a little easier to avoid, more clever dinosaurs may follow you back home and discover your hold group, compromising safety. The jungle, which may have provided you the ability to be stealthy and move unnoticed, is not fickle and grants that ability to the dinosaurs. Raptors can come in full force or in a small recon mission, testing your defenses. If you see a small hole in your fences, pistols

Either way be careful, you must use your knowledge of the park and the animals to counter it. 

Someone in the group must be scientist or a hunter or someone native to island. Even a computer nerd can come in handy

 Speaking of Dinosaurs, triceratops, you name it! Look in awe as the island holds a complete ecological system. Maybe you want to take a photo? or video? Just bare that sightseeing may lead to a chase scene, so keep on your toes. Also, Ingen had a nasty habit of not mentioning all the dinosaurs and different prehistoric creature so be prepare for new, exciting and scary things. 

The point is survive long enough and maybe everyone makes it back home.

But let's consider Plan A. If everything went right, and Hammond's friends in the Costa Rican government get the local police after him. Maybe his twenty minute head start is enough confusion for Biosyn to pick him up from the mainland in a helicopter, if he thought to set that up ahead of time. And now Dennis Nedry spends the rest of his life in a non-extraditing country of some variety, living off of however much pie $1.5 million can buy in 1993.

You play as Jeff Goldblum (not essential

You choose what equipment and how much you start off with (the garage scene in the beginning of the film). 

You have a camera as your 'main' bit of equipment. 

Main mission is the story of the movie (with added video game scenes).

Free roam is optional, shooting photos of dinosaurs [closer the better, carnivores worth more than herbivores, alive worth more than dead etc], then going back to base to send the photos off) and this money is used to get air supplies of weapons (possibly food [you can scavenge for food as well, it's  hard to collect enough]). Alternatively, you can steal from the 'bad guys' from the movie (so sneak/storm their camp(s) and steal). 

Up to 4 players. If not multiplayer, if you dont have enough food/water for them, they can die.  

I'm not planning to make this because I dont have the skills/time/money

Let it be set in the future and they can make him look like an old man running a a company which protects people from Dinosaurs in South America. In the time between movies 3 and 4 the dinosaurs finally breach land in the northern part of South America and in Central America. In a panic America places a 100 ft electric which was built by Ingen. After the company survived a near Enron fallout they invested their last stocks in the electric fence projects which were used on Isla Sorna for the park. The government bailed them out in order to contract them out to he American-Mexican border. Now Ingen had become in bed with the US govt. and worked there way back into the genetic research side of things. In an effort to recover their research from the islands affected by the dinosaur insurgence they launched a military operation to transport as many dinosaurs to a research base in Texas. Before the ships could get back a militant animal right activists set charges in the boats in order to sink right of the coast setting the dinosaurs free. This was the biggest messup in history. Now dinosaurs run rampant throughout South America and began breeding rapidly. Soon 15 species of Dinosaurs were killing and destroying villages and soon towns. Sam Neil has sent his team on a mission to Venezuela to find a scientist who has created a virus that will only infect the dino's. Now they have to fight their way through militias and dinosaurs to make it from the border of mexico all the way to Venezuela. This would be my dream movie! ,t5_2sdsw,True

The idea of a small number of people stranded a dinosaur infested island after willingly going there with limited equipment is a silly idea


So the park has been reclaimed after a massive attempt by InGen to reinstate a working (and safe) resort on the island. After several months of incident-free operation, the United States government is repossessing all InGen properties--including the dinosaurs.


Now obviously the new InGen C.E.O. fights this tooth and nail and comes to find out that this decision was pushed through by a lobbyist representing a rival company which will receive much of InGen's properties and records. I think that this corporate wrestling match would ideally take up the first third of the film, the velociraptors, and other carnivores won't be shown until they are actual threats).


So the litigation continues until, with the latter being killed, allowing the main characters (as well as the audience) to regard the dinosaurs as living animals rather than movie monsters. Of course, the majority of animals chosen are the more...voracious ones.


The animals are caged in criminally small quarters and tranquilized for transport. They are loaded onto one of a handful of ships that cast off for the mainland. At this point, and the incompetence of the company taking control of the dinosaurs renders the ship without power, in a storm, with raptors loose in the halls (imagine the suspense there). The main characters jump ship and weather the storm which casts them away on a nearby island.


Here the question comes up: are there dinosaurs here as well? The main characters are wary and decide that the safest path is to go for higher ground (what appears to be a plateau) and begin to journey into the island, but the human castaways now have a goal and a place from which to possibly call for help.


At this point the characters must begin making their way towards the boat


***TL;DR: New park built over old one. InGen dissolved in corrupt move by U.S. gov. which is pushed by a rival company that gets ahold of the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs get shipped out,False,self,t5_2sdsw,False,,,t3_16ndn0

It's long but here's my response:
Sorry to whoever took the time to do this

First of all

With that said

I run iheartjurassicpark with over a thousand followers who love the original movie for what it is. Many of these people including myself have read the books. I understand when people complain about book &amp; film adaptation but we need to understand that no movie is ever going to be exactly the book it adapted from. This is because of time and money. It costs a lot of money to film on locations, costumes, etc. The list goes on. Film to book adaptation is a very costly and timely responsibility.

Like said

Also,118 worldwide off this movie. I highly doubt they would do this again unless they do it many many many years from now (and it will probably end up being bad like the rest of remade films).

Film wise, and all. It’s was basically the birth of amazing CGI work. I honestly believe that whether or not a person dislikes the movie they can’t sit there and say it was poorly filmed, especially because it was a little different from the book.

While Jurassic Park II: The Lost World wasn’t as up there as the first

Not to mention that Michael Crichton himself did the screenplay for Jurassic Park. That’s kinda like telling him he didn’t do good enough approving the movie that adapted from his own book.

Plus

You also mentioned that if Universal is hesitant about remaking the movies because of the whiny fanboys who commplain (ignorantly) about the idea of remaking JP… there was a solution for this, will make it better and more like the book? No. Steven and Crichton were good friends and Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time. Who would you want to direct it? Johnston over Spielberg? No. Crichton has passed away. Who’s going to work on the screenplay and approve the adaptation, you? No. Plus now, a lot of us fanboy/girls know your evil plan so that’s not going to work :P You’re not going to calm fans by showing that Spielberg is producing it. Were not stupid. That would only make us more upset (as it should that Spielberg isn’t directing the 4th movie. stay optimistic people!)

You aren’t Michael Crichton. Give the man some respect.

“We want these remakes to start being produced while Spielberg is still alive

I’m sorry for getting your hopes up but I highly doubt this will happen. If it does it will be years and years from now by some money hungry director who wont make it more like the books. Of course I’ll go see it

And next time you try to do something like this, and Crichton fans because here on my blog we are all one and we are grateful for the film and book that both Spielberg and Crichton has given us.

Thanks
tabitha

Unless

I could imagine different corporations fighting over the technology, dinosaurs!""-movie.

Perhaps there is a more political approach? Animal rights groups fighting to prevent a second extinction of these precious animals

Military involvement? Will they try to breed weaponized dinosaur mounts/soldiers?

How deep does the rabbit hole go when you start to investigate InGen Technologies? All the way to something like the Umbrella Corporation?

I'm pretty sure it will involve another science expedition to Isla Nublar, it's mostly just a monster movie with a dinosaur angle, so I guess it's all about characters and cool scenes to make it a fun movie, but I'm not sure how to stretch it out into another trilogy.

1. Pteranodons attacking the chopper? When were there even Pteranodons in the park

2. What happens to Dr. Sorkin's assistant? He practically dissapears.

3. Where did the Raptors come from? Muldoon said there were only three raptors on the island.

4. Why have so much build-up for the Troodon when they have sucha minor part?

5. Mosasaur? How do they even get the D.N.A for that?

1344217452.0,xqpav,"Since I saw the other dream synopsis for JP 4, here are a few of my own...",Lawborne,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/xqpav/since_i_saw_the_other_dream_synopsis_for_jp_4/

Firstly, tropical storms, dinosaurs escaping, disease, and industrial sabotage) and you can throw in some complex scientists and zoologists who can expand upon some of themes. A fun idea on my part, but I know it’s unlikely as a mini-series.

Quick [teaser](http://youtu.be/0U_Pnk56pfc) I did for this idea.

My idea for a fourth movie came from the falling action of the first book. It starts off with a drug deal occurring on a dock of Isla Sorna (evading authorities) and a few raptors hitch a ride on one of the boats to a large port in Latin America (like in the book). The raptors wreak havoc on the docks and are killed; it provides the breaking point (after the events of the first 3 films) and the UN is forced to send in teams to destroy the dinosaurs. Like in the book, and a T-Rex chasing an off-road bike. You could even throw in a third act where the characters have to get to the coast before bombers wipe out the island (based on the info collected from the teams).

Anybody want to hear how I would have written Indy 4 while we are at it? I wrote a nine-page outline to prove someone could write a fourth one that wouldn't suck and everyone I've shown it to has been blown away.

I didn't like the end of Jurassic Park where Ian just babbled on and on and Hammond just took it all like a baby. It felt more like a ""political"" message than storytelling but overall I liked these books a lot. 

The research put into these books are great. It makes me wonder why it isn't real already. It sounds like it makes so much sense!! ""Yes, we can infer that from their behavior. Well duh we would get dna from amber. Uh duh there would be another island.""

""Ladies and Gentlemen of the United States. I have some tragic news to bare. The South American continent has been invaded by strange creatures. We believe these creatures to be genetically engineered dinosaurs made by a cell of terrorists from the middle east. A boat carrying these dinosaurs which we discovered last week were on there way to a research facility in Nevada. They were nearing the coast of South America when a bomb was detonated on the ship allowing it to sink in shallow water. The terrorists then boarded and released the Dinosaurs from there storage facilities. In an attempt to keep the Dinosaurs from coming to America we have a defensive maneuver almost ready to be turned on. InGen Electric has created a set of 100 feet tall electric fence designed to keep these dinosaurs at bay. My heart goes out to those being affected there. It turns out over 5

2. How does a visitor ever see a raptor in that pen?? Is there an underground room with windows or what?? Do visitors get out of the car to walk to it?

3. I hate how Nedry's death was handled like a cartoon. There's a goofdick cartoon slipping sound when he falls in the stream. Then the dilophosaurus appears in the jeep before he gets there like a Droopy cartoon.

4. Why are there action scenes not involving dinosaurs? We have an island full of dinosaurs

5. Generally I dislike the pure-luck timing of a T-rex coming in and fighting the raptors to save the day.
